Introduction
[2]
The Applicant is a Canadian citizen. The Applicant's wife and stepson are citizens of the Republic of the Congo, applied for permanent residence in Canada as members of the family class on the basis of their relationship to the Applicant under subsection 12(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
]. The Applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of the Immigration and Refugee Board by which it was determined that the marriage was not genuine and had been entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the
IRPA
.
III.
Judicial Procedure
[3]
This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
IRPA
for judicial review of the IAD's decision, dated November 28, 2011.
IV.
Background
[4]
The Applicant, Mr. Samuel Kitomi, is a Canadian citizen who was born in 1960 in the Congo. He was married to a woman in 1993, who he divorced in 1995.
[5]
The Applicant's spouse, Ms. Diane Sorelle Azam Mpono, was born in 1980 in the Congo; her son, Christophe, was born in 2000 in the Congo.
[6]
The Applicant and Ms. Mpono met in November 2004 in Gabon, where both were refugees. They began cohabiting in February 2005.
[7]
The Applicant is Baha'i; Ms. Mpono, Roman Catholic; the Applicant, in his testimony, brought forward the universal outlook that the Baha'i faith is favourable to all faiths in its recognition of the unity encompassing them all.
[8]
On June 8, 2005, the Applicant came to Canada as a Convention refugee and became a permanent resident of Canada.
[9]
On June 25, 2005, the Applicant and Ms. Mpono were married by power of attorney since the Applicant was living in Canada and Ms. Mpono in Gabon.
[10]
On September 10, 2010, an immigration officer refused Ms. Mpono's application to be selected for permanent residence as a member of the family class on the basis of her relationship to the Applicant. The Applicant appealed the decision to the IAD under subsection 63(1) of the
IRPA
.
[11]
In October 2011, the Applicant visited his wife in Gabon.
[12]
In support of the Appeal, the Applicant filed the following documentary evidence: emails and correspondence between himself and Ms. Mpono, emails to his Member of Parliament, evidence of transfers of funds from 2005 to 2011, photographic evidence of the Applicant's visit to Gabon, and telephone cards. At the Appeal, he testified that he sent Ms. Mpono $300 CAD per month for a total of $25,000 CAD.
[13]
The IAD dismissed the Applicant's appeal on November 28, 2011.
V.
Decision under Review
[14]
The IAD determined that, on a balance of probabilities, the Applicant's marriage was not genuine and had been entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the
IRPA
[bad faith marriage]. Pursuant to section 4 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 [
Regulations
], Ms. Mpono could not be considered the Applicant's spouse for the purpose of the family class provisions of the
Regulations
and the
IRPA
.
[15]
The IAD noted that section 4 was amended on September 30, 2010 but found that the amendment did not affect the outcome of the Appeal.
[16]
The IAD stated that there were two elements to the bad faith marriage test: (i) a marriage that is not genuine; and, (ii) a marriage that was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the
IRPA
. The Applicant has the onus of showing, on a balance of probabilities, that his marriage is not a bad faith marriage.
[17]
According to the IAD, significant gaps, discrepancies, and inconsistencies in the evidence demonstrated that, on a balance of probabilities, the Applicant's marriage was not genuine. The Applicant and Ms. Mpono did not intend to have a lasting relationship since they had not seen each other for 6 years and had"not bothered to learn, share or remember basic information about each other"(Decision at para 12).
[18]
The IAD considered the Applicant and Ms. Mpono to be incompatible in age and marital background as he is 20 years older and had been previously married and divorced. They were also incompatible due to their different religious beliefs and the fact that Ms. Mpono has a child. While the incompatibilities were not determinative, they gained significance in light of the rapid development of the relationship and the inconsistencies and discrepancies in their knowledge of one another.
[19]
The length of the Applicant and Ms. Mpono's relationship was not accurately set out in the documentation; they met in November 2004 and began cohabiting in February 2005. They did not satisfactorily explain why, given their incompatibilities, the relationship so rapidly evolved into marriage or why they married after he left Gabon.
[20]
The IAD noted that the Applicant and Ms. Mpono provided documented evidence that they regularly communicated. The IAD accepted that costs and the Applicant's need to preserve his refugee status prevented the Applicant from visiting Ms. Mpono and Christophe in the Congo but added that they could have met in another country. The IAD noted that his October 2011 visit occurred after he acquired Canadian citizenship and after the immigration officer refused Ms. Mpono's application for permanent residence.
[21]
Nonetheless, the Applicant and Ms. Mpono did not demonstrate that they knew one another well enough to establish a genuine marriage. The IAD found that there were significant inconsistencies and discrepancies in their knowledge of each other, noting Ms. Mpono's unawareness of the duration of the Applicant's studies in Europe, the details of his refugee claim and his first marriage, his relationship with another woman after his divorce, and his religious affiliation. The Applicant was unaware of Christophe's weekly religious classes and contradicted Ms. Mpono's testimony on the religious education of any children they might have. There was no evidence to demonstrate any depth or commonality in the relationship.
[22]
The IAD inferred that the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the IRPA from the Applicant's inability to establish that it was a genuine marriage. It was more likely than not that the marriage was entered into primarily to allow Ms. Mpono and Christophe to acquire permanent resident status in Canada.
VI.
Issue
[23]
Did the IAD base its decision on an erroneous finding of fact rendered in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the evidence before it?

VIII.
Position of the Parties
[26]
The Applicant submits that the IAD ignored evidence demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities, that his was not a bad faith marriage. The Applicant cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 287, which held that the IAD must analyze evidence that contradicts a bad faith marriage finding.
[27]
According to the Applicant, the IAD did not refer to any corroborating evidence that was presented. In particular, the IAD did not explain why it disregarded evidence of continuous communication and financial support over a lengthy period. The IAD could have rejected the evidence but needed to explain its reason for doing so as the evidence was probative of a central issue and contradicted the IAD's findings.
[28]
The Applicant also argues that the IAD made three unreasonable findings of fact. First, the Applicant claims that the IAD was unreasonable in finding that he and Ms. Mpono did not satisfactorily explain (i) the rapid development and short duration of their relationship given their incompatibilities, or (ii) their failure to marry before he left Gabon. The Applicant submits that he and Ms. Mpono gave a clear and consistent account of the nature and evolution of their relationship. Both explained that they could not marry before he left Gabon for financial reasons and that Ms. Mpono's family was not living in Gabon. Each explained the importance of having family attend weddings in Africa, even if the Applicant himself could not, and that proxy weddings were an accepted practice in Congolese law and by the Catholic Church.
[29]
Second, the Applicant argues that the IAD was unreasonable to infer that his marriage was not genuine from his failure to visit Ms. Mpono until October 2011. The Applicant states that he provided a cogent explanation for his inability to travel; he could not visit his wife in the Congo because returning could be considered reavailment and could have jeopardized his refugee status. Moreover, the Applicant adduced evidence that he visited his wife immediately after obtaining citizenship and travel funds.
[30]
Finally, the Applicant contends that the IAD was unreasonable to find that he and Ms. Mpono did not know each other to the extent expected of a genuine marriage. Inconsistencies and discrepancies in their knowledge of one another, alleged by the IAD arose from the IAD as they had not assessed the evidence as a whole in cultural context in respect of testimony over the telephone.
[31]
The Applicant argues that there was no inconsistency or discrepancy in knowledge with respect to the duration of the Applicant's studies in Europe since Ms. Mpono had testified that the Applicant studied pharmacy in Europe for many years. The IAD also erred in finding that she was not aware of the details of his first marriage and divorce because she had testified that his first wife left him for another man, that the divorce took place in 1995, and that they did not have children. The Applicant concedes that Ms. Mpono did not know the Applicant had converted to Baha'i but responds that she was aware that he had been born Christian and was not Catholic.
[32]
The Respondent contends that the IAD considered the totality of the evidence, including evidence of communication, their October 2011 trip, and funds transfers but found that its probity was outweighed by inconsistencies and discrepancies in their knowledge of one another that undermined their credibility and the genuineness of their relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Respondent argues that the IAD is presumed to have weighed and considered all the evidence. The Respondent submits that simply not mentioning all the evidence does not rebut the presumption, citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 70.
[33]
The Respondent challenges the probative value of the Applicant's evidence. The photographs confirm that he visited Ms. Mpono in October 2011, a fact that the IAD never disputed. For the IAD, the central issue was that the trip did not occur until 6 years after marriage; the photographs, even if ignored, were not material to this issue. Evidence of communication and funds transfers, moreover, did not address the IAD's concerns as to their knowledge of one another's histories.
[34]
In the Respondent's view, the Applicant's argument that the IAD ignored evidence amounts to a disagreement with the way the IAD weighed the evidence. The Respondent contends that the IAD supported its finding by discussing the evidence it considered most cogent. Evidence that was not analyzed by the IAD did not undermine the findings it considered determinative; that the Applicant's marriage was not a genuine marriage because the relationship evolved too quickly in light of incompatibilities, that they had not seen each other until 6 years after the marriage, and that they did not demonstrate that they knew one another well enough.
[35]
The Respondent responds that the IAD was reasonable to infer that the Applicant's 6 year absence was inconsistent with a genuine marriage. The Applicant, as the IAD noted, could have visited Ms. Mpono in another country and could have sought the financial assistance of relatives, as he did when he visited in October 2011.
[36]
According to the Respondent, it was also reasonable to infer that the Applicant and Ms. Mpono did not know each other well enough to have a genuine marriage. First, Ms. Mpono could only testify that the Applicant spent many years studying in Europe but could not say how long he stayed there. Second, she was unaware of the details of his first marriage, including its length. Finally, Ms. Mpono did not know that the Applicant had converted and could not describe the details of his refugee claim.
IX.
Analysis
[37]
Whether the IAD based its decision that the Applicant's marriage was not a genuine marriage without regard to the material before it is a question of mixed fact and law reviewable on a reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This standard also applies to the question of whether the IAD made any erroneous findings in a perverse or capricious manner (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[38]
Because the reasonableness standard applies, the Court may only intervene if the Board's reasons are not justified, transparent or intelligible. To satisfy this standard, the decision must also fall in the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47).
[39]
The IAD based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made without regard to the evidence before it. In finding that the Applicant's marriage was a bad faith marriage, the IAD did not analyze two crucial pieces of evidence: testimony by the Applicant that he has sent $300/month to Ms. Mpono and Christophe since moving to Canada and documentary evidence of some of those funds transfers.
[40]
This particular ground for review derives from paragraph 18.1(4)(
d
) of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC, 1985, c F-7 and requires the Applicant to satisfy this Court that (i) the IAD made a palpably erroneous finding of material fact, and (ii) that this finding was made without regard to the evidence (
Cepeda- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 14). Since the IAD is particularly well-positioned to make findings of fact, this ground does not invite the Court to re-weigh evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[41]
There is a rebuttable presumption that the IAD has considered the totality of evidence in assessing whether a marriage is a bad faith marriage (
Provost
, above, at para 31). According to the jurisprudence of this Court, the presumption may be rebutted if the IAD did not, at least, address evidence that is relevant to the question at issue and contradicts its conclusion on that issue. As Justice John Maxwell Evans held  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[17] ...the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact 'without regard to the evidence' ... In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts".
[42]
At the Appeal, the Applicant testified that he (working as a security guard making $12 an hour) has sent Ms. Mpono "about $300" every month for her support because she is unemployed. He also testified that these funds transfers have amounted to a total of "[m]ore or less about $25,000", that Ms. Mpono did not save any of these funds to bring to Canada, and that he pays Christophe's school tuition (Tribunal Record [TR] at pp 23, 24 and 53).
[43]
The Tribunal Record includes 23 Customer Receipts [receipts] for funds transfers from Western Union and MoneyGram (at pp 113-136). With exception of one transfer from the Applicant to Romuald Pinda in the amount of $100 CAD, dated January 9, 2007, these receipts refer to funds sent by the Applicant to Ms. Mpono. The amount of each transfer ranges from $80 to $350 CDN, amounting to a total of $4,236 CAD. The Tribunal Record also includes a "Customer Copy", dated February 1, 2006, in respect of $81.96 (at p 114). This document identifies Ms. Mpono as "Sender" and the Applicant as "Receiver" but it is unclear whether this refers to funds sent by Ms. Mpono to the Applicant or to an acknowledgement sent by Ms. Mpono to the Applicant in respect of funds received by Ms. Mpono and sent by the Applicant.
[44]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  outlines a list of factors that the IAD may consider in applying the bad faith marriage test: the length of the relationship before marriage, age differences, former marital or civil status, the respective financial situation and employment of the couple, family background, knowledge of one another's histories, language, and, respective interests.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice John O'Keefe found that the IAD was unreasonable to disregard voluntary support payments in applying the bad faith marriage test simply because the applicant was also required the make court-ordered support payments to a different sexual partner (at para 47).
Glen
leads to the inference that, in certain circumstances, voluntary support payments are material to a finding that a genuine marriage exists.
[45]
Consequently, the jurisprudence of this Court has established that the respective financial situation of the parties and the existence of voluntary support payments are relevant in assessing whether a marriage is or is not a genuine marriage.
[46]
Evidence of voluntary support payments totalling $25,000 CAD over 6 years from the Applicant to Ms. Mpono contradicts the IAD's finding that the marriage was not a genuine marriage, especially since the Applicant has produced documentary evidence for $4,236 of the alleged payments. The Applicant also gave up any additional studies in pharmacy for accreditation in Canada as he could not pay for his professional studies and also send funds to his wife. This evidence has probative value on a key issue and this Court, following
Cepeda- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is prepared to infer that the IAD made an erroneous finding of fact without regard to the evidence from the IAD's failure to discuss it. Although
Cepeda-Gutierrez
does not require decision-makers to consider "every piece of evidence that they received that is contrary to their finding, and to explain how they dealt with it" (at para 16), reasonableness required the IAD to explain why they disregarded this particular evidence.
[47]
Evidence of voluntary payments from the Applicant to Ms. Mpono is a type of evidence falling within the scope of
Cepeda-Gutierrez
.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  this Court distinguished evidence that has "specific bearing" on an applicant, which falls within the scope of
Cepeda-Gutierrez
, from general evidence, which does not (at para 15).
[48]
The IAD's detailed analysis of the inconsistencies and discrepancies in the Applicant and Ms. Mpono's knowledge of each other support the conclusion that the IAD ought to have analyzed the evidence of voluntary support payments. According to
Cepeda-Gutierrez
, it may be easier to infer that a decision-maker neglected contradictory evidence if it "refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion" (at para 17).
[49]
This Court has reached the determination notwithstanding the inconsistencies and discrepancies in the Applicant's and Ms. Mpono's knowledge of each other, the quick evolution of their relationship into marriage, their alleged incompatibilities, and their failure to marry before the Applicant left Gabon.
[50]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Evans stated that in applying
Cepeda- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , "[m]uch depends on the significance of that evidence when it is considered
in light of the other material on which the decision was based
" [Emphasis added] (at para 9). Consequently, the question of whether the IAD ought to have had regard to the evidence of the voluntary support payments also involves a consideration of the significance of that evidence against other evidence relied upon by the IAD.
[51]
In the present case, evidence relied upon by the IAD in reaching its decision does not diminish the significance of the evidence of the voluntary support payments. In certain circumstances, such evidence may establish a relationship of support that could lead to an inference that a genuine marriage exists. With the exception of evidence that the Applicant and Ms. Mpono lived apart for six years, the evidence discussed by the IAD does not address issues of support, financial or emotional. Consequently, it cannot be said to diminish the significance of the voluntary support payments.
[52]
This Court is not the finder of fact or the decision-maker of first instance to weigh these contradictory pieces of evidence. Pursuant to
Cepeda-Gutierrez
and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, however, the Court did find that the IAD did not give appropriate consideration to the voluntary support payments, an oversight that was unreasonable given the significance of the evidence in light of other evidence that the IAD relied upon.
[53]
This conclusion is sufficient to set aside and refer for determination anew the IAD's decision. Consequently, it is not necessary to consider whether the IAD made any erroneous findings in a perverse or capricious manner.
X.
Conclusion
[54]
For all of the above reasons, the Applicant's application for judicial review is granted and the matter is returned for a hearing anew (
de novo
) before a differently constituted panel of the IAD.
JUDGMENT
[55]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
Applicant's application for judicial review be granted and the matter be returned for a hearing anew (
de novo
) before a differently constituted panel of the Immigration Appeal Division. No question for certification

Le demandeur a rendu visite à sa femme au Gabon en octobre 2011.
[12]
Le demandeur a déposé les éléments de preuve documentaire suivants au soutien de son appel devant la SAI: des courriels et lettres échangés par lui et Mme Mpono, des courriels adressés à son député, des pièces justificatives de virements de fonds effectués de 2005 à 2011, des photographies attestant sa visite au Gabon et des cartes téléphoniques. Il a déclaré dans son témoignage devant la SAI qu'il avait envoyé un total de 25 000 $CAN à Mme Mpono, à raison de 300 $CAN par mois.
[13]
La SAI a rejeté l'appel du demandeur le 28 novembre 2011.
V.
La décision contrôlée
[14]
La SAI a conclu que, suivant la prépondérance des probabilités, le mariage du demandeur n'était pas authentique et visait principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la
LIPR
[mariage de mauvaise foi]. Par conséquent, selon l'article 4 du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 [le
Règlement
], Mme Mpono ne pouvait être considérée comme l'épouse du demandeur pour l'application des dispositions relatives au regroupement familial dudit
Règlement
et de la
LIPR
.
[15]
La SAI a pris acte du fait que l'article 4 avait été modifié le 30 septembre 2010, mais a conclu que cette modification n'avait aucun effet sur l'issue de l'appel.
[16]
La SAI a d'abord rappelé que le critère applicable au point de savoir si un mariage a été contracté de mauvaise foi comporte deux éléments: i) le mariage n'est pas authentique; et ii) il visait principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la
LIPR
. Le demandeur supportait la charge de prouver selon la prépondérance des probabilités que son mariage n'avait pas été contracté de mauvaise foi.
[17]
D'après la SAI, d'importantes lacunes, contradictions et divergences constatées dans la preuve établissaient que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le mariage du demandeur n'était pas authentique. Ce dernier et Mme Mpono ne prévoyaient pas une union durable puisqu'ils étaient restés six ans sans se voir et n'avaient « pas pris la peine d'apprendre, d'échanger ou de se rappeler les renseignements de base concernant l'un et l'autre » (décision de la SAI, paragraphe 12).
[18]
La SAI a relevé diverses incompatibilités entre le demandeur et Mme Mpono: quant à l'âge - le demandeur est l'aîné de sa femme de 20 ans -, quant aux antécédents conjugaux - il est divorcé -, quant aux croyances religieuses et du fait que Mme Mpono a un enfant. Bien que la SAI n'estimait pas ces incompatibilités décisives, elles lui semblaient gagner en importance à la lumière du développement rapide de la relation, ainsi que des contradictions et divergences caractérisant la connaissance mutuelle des conjoints.
[19]
La preuve documentaire ne rendait pas un compte précis de la durée de la relation entre le demandeur et Mme Mpono. Ils s'étaient rencontrés en novembre 2004 et avaient commencé à cohabiter en février 2005. Les conjoints n'avaient pas expliqué de manière satisfaisante comment, étant donné leurs incompatibilités, leur relation avait abouti si vite au mariage, ni pourquoi ils s'étaient mariés après que le demandeur eut quitté le Gabon.
[20]
La SAI a pris acte des éléments documentaires produits par le demandeur et Mme Mpono afin de prouver qu'ils communiquaient régulièrement. Elle a reconnu que les frais en cause et la nécessité pour le demandeur de conserver son statut de réfugié avaient empêché ce dernier de rendre visite à Mme Mpono et à son fils Christophe au Congo, mais elle a ajouté qu'ils auraient pu se rencontrer dans un autre pays. La SAI a noté que la visite d'octobre 2011 avait eu lieu après que le demandeur eut acquis la citoyenneté canadienne et qu'un agent d'immigration eut rejeté la demande de résidence permanente de Mme Mpono.
[21]
Néanmoins, toujours selon la SAI, le demandeur et Mme Mpono n'avaient pas démontré qu'ils se connussent assez bien pour qu'on puisse conclure à l'authenticité de leur mariage. La SAI a relevé d'importantes contradictions et divergences sur le plan de leur connaissance mutuelle, notamment le fait que Mme Mpono ignorait la durée des études du demandeur en Europe, le détail de sa demande d'asile et de son premier mariage, la liaison qu'il avait eue avec une autre femme après son divorce, ainsi que son appartenance religieuse. Quant au demandeur, il ignorait que Christophe suivait des leçons hebdomadaires de catéchisme et il a contredit le témoignage de Mme Mpono touchant l'éducation religieuse que le couple entendait donner à ses enfants éventuels. La SAI estimait ne pas disposer d'éléments établissant que les conjoints avaient des points communs ou démontrant une quelconque profondeur dans leur relation.
[22]
La SAI a inféré de l'incapacité du demandeur à établir l'authenticité de son mariage que celui-ci visait principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la
LIPR
. Il était selon elle plus probable qu'improbable que le demandeur et Mme Mpono s'étaient mariés principalement dans le but de permettre à cette dernière et à son fils d'acquérir le statut de résidents permanents au Canada.
VI.
La question en litige
[23]
La SAI a-t-elle rendu une décision fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire, ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle disposait?

VIII.
Les thèses des parties
[26]
Le demandeur soutient que la SAI a omis de tenir compte d'éléments établissant, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il n'avait pas contracté son mariage de mauvaise foi. Il cite la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au soutien du principe que « l'obligation [pour la SAI] de fournir une explication augmente en fonction de la pertinence de la preuve en question au regard des faits contestés » (paragraphe 17), ainsi que
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 287, qui affirme que la SAI est tenue d'analyser les éléments de preuve qui contredisent sa conclusion selon laquelle le mariage en cause a été contracté de mauvaise foi.
[27]
Aux dires du demandeur, la SAI n'a fait référence à aucun des éléments de corroboration qu'il avait produits. Elle a notamment omis d'expliquer pourquoi elle n'avait pas tenu compte des éléments tendant à établir l'existence d'une communication constante et d'un soutien pécuniaire de longue durée. Il était loisible à la SAI de rejeter ces éléments de preuve, mais elle était tenue d'exposer les raisons de ce rejet, puisque ces éléments avaient une valeur probante à l'égard d'une question centrale et contredisaient ses conclusions.
[28]
Le demandeur soutient aussi que la SAI a tiré trois conclusions de fait déraisonnables. La première est que Mme Mpono et lui n'auraient pas expliqué de manière satisfaisante i) le développement rapide et la courte durée de leur relation, étant donné leurs incompatibilités, ni ii) le fait qu'ils ne se soient pas mariés avant son départ du Gabon. Le demandeur fait valoir que Mme Mpono et lui ont relaté de façon claire et cohérente la nature et l'évolution de leur relation. Tous deux ont expliqué que des raisons pécuniaires les avaient empêchés de se marier avant que le demandeur ne quitte le Gabon, que la famille de Mme Mpono ne vivait pas dans ce pays, qu'il était important pour les Africains que la famille assiste aux mariages, même si le demandeur ne pouvait être présent au sien, et que le droit congolais aussi bien que l'Église catholique reconnaissaient le mariage par procuration.
[29]
Deuxièmement, le demandeur estime mal fondée en raison la conclusion par laquelle la SAI a inféré l'inauthenticité de son mariage du fait qu'il n'ait pas rendu visite à Mme Mpono avant octobre 2011. Le demandeur affirme avoir fourni une explication convaincante de son incapacité à voyager: il ne pouvait rendre visite à sa femme au Congo parce que, en retournant dans ce pays, il aurait risqué d'être considéré comme se réclamant à nouveau de la protection de l'État congolais et aurait ainsi mis en péril son statut de réfugié. Qui plus est, il avait produit des éléments établissant qu'il avait rendu visite à sa femme immédiatement après avoir acquis sa citoyenneté et obtenu l'argent nécessaire pour le voyage.
[30]
La troisième conclusion déraisonnable que le demandeur attribue à la SAI est celle selon laquelle Mme Mpono et lui ne se connaissaient pas dans la mesure qu'on attendrait des contractants d'un mariage authentique. C'est à la SAI elle-même qu'il faut attribuer les contradictions et divergences qu'elle suppose dans la connaissance mutuelle des conjoints, puisqu'elle n'a pas apprécié la preuve globalement dans son contexte culturel pour ce qui concerne le témoignage téléphonique.
[31]
Le demandeur fait valoir que la connaissance mutuelle des conjoints n'était entachée d'aucune contradiction ou divergence touchant la durée de ses études en Europe, puisque Mme Mpono a déclaré dans son témoignage qu'il avait étudié la pharmacie en Europe durant de nombreuses années. La SAI a également eu tort de conclure que Mme Mpono n'était pas au courant du détail de son premier mariage et de son divorce, puisqu'elle avait déclaré que sa première femme l'avait quitté pour un autre homme, que le divorce avait été prononcé en 1995 et qu'il n'avait pas eu d'enfants de ce mariage. Le demandeur concède que Mme Mpono ignorait qu'il s'était converti au bahaïsme, mais réplique à cet argument qu'elle le savait chrétien non catholique de naissance.
[32]
Le défendeur soutient quant à lui que la SAI a pris en considération la totalité de la preuve, y compris les éléments relatifs à la communication entre les conjoints, à leur voyage d'octobre 2011 et aux virements de fonds, mais qu'elle a conclu que l'emportaient sur la valeur probante de ces éléments les contradictions et divergences caractérisant la connaissance mutuelle des conjoints, qui incitaient à mettre en doute leur crédibilité et l'authenticité de leur relation. Le défendeur invoque l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au soutien de l'argument que la SAI est présumée avoir apprécié et pris en considération la totalité de la preuve. Il ajoute, s'appuyant cette fois sur
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 70, que le simple fait de ne pas avoir cité tous les éléments de preuve ne renverse pas cette présomption.
[33]
Le défendeur met en discussion la valeur probante de la preuve du demandeur. Les photographies produites confirment bien qu'il a rendu visite à Mme Mpono en octobre 2011, mais la SAI n'a jamais contesté ce fait. Pour celle-ci, la question centrale était que ce voyage n'avait eu lieu que six ans après le mariage; or les photographies, qu'on les prenne ou non en considération, n'étaient pas pertinentes pour cette question. En outre, les éléments tendant à établir la communication entre les conjoints et les virements de fonds ne contribuaient pas à dissiper les doutes de la SAI concernant la connaissance qu'ils avaient du passé l'un de l'autre.
[34]
Selon le défendeur, l'argument du demandeur selon lequel la SAI n'a pas tenu compte de certains éléments de preuve équivaut en fait à un désaccord avec elle sur la manière dont elle a apprécié la preuve. La SAI, explique le défendeur, a étayé sa conclusion par l'analyse des éléments de preuve qu'elle jugeait les plus convaincants. Les éléments de preuve qu'elle n'a pas analysés n'infirment en rien les conclusions qu'elle estimait décisives, à savoir que le mariage du demandeur n'était pas authentique, aux motifs que la relation des conjoints avait évolué trop vite étant donné leurs incompatibilités, qu'ils ne s'étaient revus que six ans après s'être mariés et qu'ils n'avaient pas démontré se connaître suffisamment l'un l'autre.
[35]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il était raisonnable de la part de la SAI de conclure que l'absence de six ans du demandeur ne cadrait pas avec un mariage authentique. Le demandeur, comme la SAI l'a fait observer, aurait pu rencontrer Mme Mpono dans un autre pays et aurait pu demander plus tôt, comme il l'a fait pour sa visite d'octobre 2011, l'aide pécuniaire de parents.
[36]
D'après le défendeur, il était également raisonnable de conclure que le demandeur et Mme Mpono ne se connaissaient pas assez bien pour que leur mariage soit authentique. Premièrement, Mme Mpono, dans son témoignage, a pu dire seulement que le demandeur avait passé de nombreuses années à étudier en Europe, sans pouvoir préciser combien de temps il y était resté. Deuxièmement, elle ignorait les particularités du premier mariage du demandeur, notamment sa durée. Enfin, elle ne savait pas que ce dernier s'était converti au bahaïsme et elle s'est révélée incapable d'exposer le détail de sa demande d'asile.
IX.
Analyse
[37]
Le point de savoir si la SAI a rendu sa décision selon laquelle le mariage du demandeur n'était pas authentique sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle disposait est une question mixte de fait et de droit, qui relève de la norme du caractère raisonnable:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La même norme de contrôle s'applique à la question de savoir si la SAI s'est fondée sur des conclusions de fait erronées, tirées de façon abusive ou arbitraire:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[38]
Étant donné que la norme du caractère raisonnable s'applique à la présente instance, la Cour ne peut intervenir que si la décision de la SAI est injustifiée, ou si le processus y ayant mené manque de transparence ou d'intelligibilité. Pour remplir cette norme, la décision de la SAI doit aussi appartenir« aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 47.
[39]
La SAI a fondé sa décision sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle disposait. Elle a conclu que le mariage du demandeur avait été contracté de mauvaise foi sans avoir analysé deux éléments de preuve d'une importance cruciale: les déclarations faites par le demandeur dans son témoignage selon lesquelles il avait envoyé 300 $ par mois à Mme Mpono et Christophe depuis son installation au Canada, et la preuve documentaire établissant certains des virements de fonds en question.
[40]
Ce motif particulier de contrôle, qui découle de l'alinéa 18.1(4)
d
) de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC 1985, c F-7, oblige le demandeur à convaincre notre Cour que i) la SAI a tiré sur des faits importants une conclusion manifestement erronée et que ii) elle a tiré cette conclusion sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle disposait:
Cepeda-Gutierrez
, précitée, paragraphe 14. En outre, comme la SAI est particulièrement bien placée pour tirer des conclusions de fait, ce motif n'appelle pas l'appréciation de la preuve par la Cour sur de nouveaux frais:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 14.
[41]
La SAI bénéficie de la présomption renversable d'avoir pris en considération la totalité de la preuve dans l'examen du point de savoir si un mariage a été contracté de mauvaise foi:
Provost
, précitée, paragraphe 31. Selon la jurisprudence de notre Cour, cette présomption peut être renversée si la SAI n'a pas analysé au minimum les éléments de preuve pertinents pour la question en litige qui contredisent sa conclusion sur celle-ci. Rappelons à ce sujet l'observation suivante formulée par le juge John Maxwell Evans dans
Cepeda-Guttierez
, précitée:
[17] [...] plus la preuve qui n'a pas été mentionnée expressément ni analysée dans les motifs de l'organisme est importante, et plus une cour de justice sera disposée à inférer de ce silence que l'organisme a tiré une conclusion de fait erronée « sans tenir compte des éléments dont il [disposait] » [...] Autrement dit, l'obligation de fournir une explication augmente en fonction de la pertinence de la preuve en question au regard des faits contestés.
[42]
À l'audience de son appel, le demandeur (qui travaillait comme garde de sécurité au taux horaire de 12 $) a déclaré avoir envoyé chaque mois [TRADUCTION] « environ 300 $ » à Mme Mpono parce qu'elle est au chômage. Il a aussi déclaré que le total des fonds ainsi virés s'élevait à [TRADUCTION] « quelque 25 000 $ », que Mme Mpono n'avait pas fait sur cette somme d'économies à emporter au Canada et qu'il paie les frais de scolarité de Christophe. Voir le dossier du tribunal, pages 23, 24 et 53.
[43]
Le dossier du tribunal (pages 113 à 136) comprend 23 récépissés délivrés au titre de virements de fonds par Western Union et MoneyGram. Exception faite d'un virement de 100 $CAN fait par le demandeur à Romuald Pinda le 9 janvier 2007, ces récépissés se rapportent tous à des fonds virés par M. Kitomi à Mme Mpono. Le montant par virement se situe entre 80 et 350 $CAN, et le total des fonds virés s'élève à 4 236 $CAN. On trouve aussi dans le dossier du tribunal un document intitulé [TRADUCTION] « Exemplaire client », daté du 1er février 2006, relatif à un virement de 81,96 $ (page 114). Ce document donne Mme Mpono comme expéditrice et le demandeur comme destinataire, mais sans qu'on sache avec certitude si Mme Mpono a expédié cette somme au demandeur ou si elle lui en accuse réception.
[44]
La décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  propose une liste de facteurs que la SAI peut prendre en considération pour établir si un mariage a été contracté de mauvaise foi: la durée de la relation des partenaires avant leur mariage, leur différence d'âge, leur état matrimonial ou civil antérieur, leurs situations pécuniaires et professionnelles respectives, leurs antécédents familiaux, la connaissance qu'ils ont du passé l'un de l'autre, leur(s) langue(s) et leurs intérêts respectifs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge John O'Keefe a conclu que la SAI avait agi déraisonnablement en omettant de tenir compte de versements volontaires de soutien dans l'analyse de l'authenticité du mariage simplement parce que le demandeur était tenu par jugement de verser une pension alimentaire à une autre partenaire (paragraphe 47). On peut déduire de
Glen
le principe que, dans certains cas, les versements volontaires de soutien sont pertinents pour l'examen de la question de l'authenticité du mariage.
[45]
Par conséquent, la jurisprudence de notre Cour établit que les situations pécuniaires respectives des partenaires et la présence de versements volontaires de soutien sont pertinentes pour l'examen du point de savoir si un mariage est ou non authentique.
[46]
Les éléments tendant à prouver le versement volontaire d'un total de 25 000 $CAN sur six ans par le demandeur à Mme Mpono contredisent la conclusion de la SAI selon laquelle le mariage n'était pas authentique, surtout si l'on considère que le demandeur a produit des éléments documentaires relatifs à une tranche de 4 236 $ des paiements supposés. En outre, le demandeur a renoncé à faire les études supplémentaires qu'aurait exigées son agrément comme pharmacien au Canada parce qu'il ne pouvait à la fois financer cette formation professionnelle et envoyer des fonds à sa femme. Ces éléments d'appréciation revêtent une valeur probante à l'égard d'une question essentielle, et notre Cour, suivant en cela la décision
Cepeda-Guttierez
, précitée, est disposée à inférer, du fait que la SAI ne les a pas analysés, qu'elle a tiré une conclusion de fait erronée sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle disposait. Il est vrai que
Cepeda-Guttierez
n'oblige pas les décideurs administratifs à « faire référence à chaque élément de preuve dont ils sont saisis et qui sont contraires à leurs conclusions de fait, et à expliquer comment ils ont traité ces éléments de preuve »(paragraphe 16), mais le critère du caractère raisonnable obligeait la SAI à expliquer pourquoi elle avait écarté ces éléments précis.
[47]
Les éléments relatifs aux versements volontaires faits par le demandeur à Mme Mpono appartiennent à la catégorie d'éléments de preuve visée par
Cepeda-Gutierrez
.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  notre Cour a distingué la preuve« concernant précisément » le demandeur en question, qui entre dans le champ d'application de
Cepeda-Guttierez
, de la preuve générale, qui y échappe (paragraphe 15).
[48]
L'analyse détaillée effectuée par la SAI des contradictions et divergences qu'elle remarquait dans les réponses données par le demandeur et Mme Mpono relativement à la connaissance qu'ils avaient l'un de l'autre étaye la conclusion qu'elle aurait dû analyser les éléments de preuve relatifs aux versements volontaires de soutien. Selon
Cepeda-Guttierez
, il peut être plus facile d'inférer que le décideur a négligé des éléments de preuve contradictoires quand il « fait référence de façon assez détaillée à des éléments de preuve appuyant sa conclusion, mais [...] passe sous silence des éléments de preuve qui tendent à prouver le contraire »(paragraphe 17).
[49]
Notre Cour est arrivée à sa conclusion malgré les contradictions et divergences relevées dans la manière dont le demandeur et Mme Mpono ont rendu compte de la connaissance qu'ils avaient l'un de l'autre, la rapidité avec laquelle leur relation a abouti au mariage, leurs incompatibilités supposées et le fait qu'ils ne se soient pas mariés avant que le demandeur ne quitte le Gabon.
[50]
Le juge Evans faisait observer au paragraphe 9 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  que, s'agissant d'appliquer
Cepeda-Guttierez
, précitée, « [i] l faut considérer l'importance relative de cette preuve
par rapport aux autres éléments sur lesquels est fondée la décision
» [non souligné dans l'original]. Par conséquent, l'examen du point de savoir si la SAI aurait dû prendre en considération les éléments tendant à établir les versements volontaires de soutien implique aussi l'appréciation de l'importance de cette preuve par rapport aux autres éléments sur lesquels elle a fondé sa décision.
[51]
Dans la présente espèce, la preuve sur laquelle la SAI a fondé sa décision n'enlève rien à l'importance des éléments attestant les versements volontaires de soutien. Dans certains cas, de tels éléments peuvent établir l'existence d'une relation de soutien dont il se révèle possible d'inférer l'authenticité du mariage. Exception faite des éléments selon lesquels le demandeur et Mme Mpono ont vécu séparés durant six ans, la preuve analysée par la SAI ne concerne pas la question du soutien, pécuniaire ou affectif, si bien qu'on ne peut dire qu'elle diminue l'importance des versements volontaires de soutien.
[52]
Notre Cour ne remplissant pas ici la fonction de juge des faits ou de décideur de première instance, il ne lui appartient pas d'apprécier ces éléments de preuve contradictoires. Néanmoins, s'appuyant sur
Cepeda-Guttierez
et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précités, la Cour conclut que la SAI n'a pas tenu compte comme elle l'aurait dû des versements volontaires de soutien, omission déraisonnable étant donné l'importance des éléments de preuve y afférents au regard des autres éléments sur lesquels elle s'est fondée.
[53]
Cette conclusion suffit à justifier l'annulation de la décision de la SAI et son renvoi devant cette dernière pour un nouvel examen. Par conséquent, il n'est pas nécessaire de se demander si la SAI a fondé sa décision sur des conclusions de fait erronées qu'elle aurait tirées de façon abusive ou arbitraire.
X.
