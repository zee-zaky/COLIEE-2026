Noël, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated April 25, 2012, pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001 c 27 (IRPA). The RPD found that the applicant is not a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA or a person in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA.
I.
Facts
[2]
The applicant is a Mexican citizen. On June 12, 2005, he witnessed the murder of Cirilo Morales Feliciano, a friend who was 16 years old. During the incident, the applicant was with another friend, Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez, as well as Jesus Victorio Barrio, known as "El Navarro". That evening, Jesus Victorio Barrio and Cirilo Morales Feliciano fought and Cirilo accused Jesus Victorio Barrio of being a horse and cattle thief. Jesus Victorio Barrio assaulted Cirio Morales Feliciano with rocks to the head, which killed him. Jesus Victorio Barrio left the area and threatened to kill the applicant and Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez if they spoke about the murder. When people approached to find out who had killed Cirilo Morales Feliciano, the applicant went home because he was afraid that Jesus Victorio Barrio would return and kill him.
[3]
After those incidents, the Office of the Public Prosecutor arrested Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez and two other men who showed up at the scene of the crime. Fearing for his life, Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez stated that Cirilo Morales Feliciano was attacked by a group of men from the village of San Augustin, Cuilutla. Thus, the police arrested three men from that village.
[4]
When the applicant learned that three innocent men had been arrested, he went to the Office of the Public Prosecutor on August 22, 2005, to make a detailed statement accusing Jesus Victorio Barrio of having been solely responsible for the death of Cirilo Morales Feliciano. According to the applicant, he had bribed certain people to ensure that he was not arrested for the crime he committed.
[5]
On July 9, 2007, the applicant received a summons from the Office of the Public Prosecutor to appear at the trial of the three men accused of murdering Cirilio Morales Feliciano. He felt obliged to question Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez on the false statement he made to the Office of the Public Prosecutor. Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez then explained that Jesus Victorio Barrio had threatened to kill him if he ever told the truth.
[6]
A few months later, the applicant learned that the three men accused of murdering Cirilio Morales Feliciano would be released. However, in December 2007, he learned that Jesus Victorio Barrio had returned to the area and had uttered threats against him and his family. Therefore, the applicant left the region with his wife and two children to go live in Chicoloapan, in the State of Mexico. He became a clothing salesperson in a small store. He rented a house and registered his children in school there.
[7]
In May 2008, the applicant learned that his friend Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez, who had moved to Guadalajara, in the State of Jalisco, had been shot dead. Following his statement, Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez had been tracked throughout the country by Jesus Victorio Barrio or people he had hired. Thus, the applicant left Mexico for Canada on July 3, 2008, and claimed refugee protection the day he arrived.
II.
Decision under review
[8]
The RPD found that the applicant is not a refugee because the reason at the basis of his refugee claim is not a valid Convention ground. Regarding the claim filed under section 97 of the IRPA, the RPD found that the applicant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be the subject of cruel and unusual treatment if he returned to Mexico.
[9]
In support of his claim, the applicant provided a declaration dated August 22, 2005, to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the State of Guerrero, in which he set forth a detailed description of what occurred on June 12, 2005, resulting in the death of Cirilio Morales Feliciano. He also provided a copy of the summons dated July 9, 2007, which states that a criminal trial was instituted with respect to the murder of Cirilio Morales Feliciano. The RPD thus found that the applicant's account was credible and that Jesus Victorio Barrio had murdered Cirilio Morales Feliciano.
[10]
The RPD found that it was curious that Jesus Victorio Barrio had been convicted of murder but was not in prison and now lives in a city close to San Augustina, Cuilutla, where the applicant's family lives. It also found that the applicant does not know whether Jesus Victorio Barrio is free because the latter has filed an appeal from the criminal conviction.
[11]
The RPD found that the applicant stated that Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez's death could only be attributed to Jesus Victorio Barrio since he had no enemies. However, it also found that the applicant lived in Chicoloapan for four and a half years in the same house. Furthermore, the applicant confirmed that he has stayed in contact with his family in Mexico and that they have not been threatened.
[12]
The RPD also found that Jesus Victorio Barrio and his family breed livestock and that he probably has neither the interest nor the financial ability to search for the applicant, especially since he was never imprisoned for the crime he committed. The RPD therefore found that the applicant could return to Chicoloapan without being at risk of cruel and unusual treatment. Furthermore, the RPD found that, given that the applicant made a living in Chicoloapan for six months before leaving Mexico for Canada, it would not be "objectively unreasonable" or "unduly harsh" to expect the refugee claimant to move to that location.
III.
Position of the applicant
[13]
The applicant submits that the RPD's decision did not take into account the evidence that it is possible to corrupt public servants in Mexico to obtain data bases containing confidential information on third parties. That evidence should have been examined as part of the internal flight alternative analysis given that it shows that, regardless of where the applicant would live, he could be located by Jesus Victorio Barrio. Thus, the RPD erred because that was a very important piece of evidence.
[14]
Furthermore, the applicant states that the RPD did not consider that the context for people in the applicant's position is very different in Mexico and instead examined the applicant's situation from a Canadian point of view. Mexico is an emerging democracy.
[15]
Third, the applicant alleges that the RPD erred when assessing his testimony. In fact, the RPD, in its decision, indicated that it did not know why Jesus Victorio Barrio did not serve prison time for murder following the guilty verdict. However, the applicant explained that there was only, to his knowledge, an arrest warrant issued against him and that he was not convicted by a Mexican court for the murder of Cirilio Morales Feliciano. Thus, the RPD's decision, particularly regarding the internal flight alternative, is erroneous because the RPD drew a negative inference based on an erroneous finding of fact. In fact, it is clear from the hearing transcripts that when the applicant was questioned about Jesus Victorio Barrio, he was referring to the proceedings involving the three accused men and that, when he claimed that Jesus Victorio Barrio was found guilty, he was actually referring to the three men released after he made his statement about Jesus Victorio Barrio. Thus, it is clear that, for the applicant, there is no difference between the acquittal of the three men and the case against Jesus Victorio Barrio.
[16]
Fourth, the applicant submits that the RPD committed an error similar to that found by this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 188 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), because it rejected his claim on the basis of the fact that he did not avail himself of an internal flight alternative before he claimed refugee protection in Canada. The RPD thus added a criterion to the test developed in the case law regarding internal flight alternative assessments.
[17]
Again regarding the internal flight alternative, the applicant states that it was not available to him given that Jesus Victorio Barrio was able to kill Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez in the State of Jalisco and he suspects that he hired a killer to do so. Thus, Jesus Victorio Barrio would have the financial means to harm the applicant. Furthermore, the applicant explained that Jesus Victorio Barrio belongs to a higher class of breeders than his. Therefore, the RPD made an arbitrary finding without regard for the evidence before it.
[18]
Finally, the fact that the RPD found the applicant to be credible should have had an impact on the internal flight alternative analysis.
IV.
Position of the respondent
[19]
The applicant submits that the RPD did not err by finding that the applicant has an internal flight alternative in Chicoloapan, where he found refuge in December 2007 with his family. The two-part text established in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  was applied fairly.
[20]
Regarding the first part of the test, the applicant did not demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he faces persecution or a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Chicoloapan. In fact, the applicant had lived there peacefully since 2007 and the respondent alleges that the RPD validly found that the applicant did not prove that Jesus Victorio Barrio would try or would be willing to try to find him.
[21]
Regarding the second part of the test, the RPD's finding that it is not unreasonable for the applicant to avail himself of the internal flight alternative in Chicoloapan, where he already lived with his family before leaving Mexico, was just.
[22]
Regarding the applicant's argument that the RPD misunderstood his testimony with respect to Jesus Victorio Barrio's arrest, the respondent states that that has no bearing on the RPD's analysis of the applicant's internal flight alternative.
V.
Issue
[23]
Did the RPD err by finding that the applicant has an internal flight alternative?
VI.
Standard of review
[24]
The reasonableness standard applies to the RPD's decision with respect to the internal flight alternative because it is a question of fact (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
VII.
Analysis
[25]
The RPD rendered an unreasonable decision for the following reasons.
[26]
The applicant's argument that the RPD added a condition to the test applicable to the internal flight alternative issue is fair. In fact, the RPD, in this case, committed an error in the application of the test that is similar to the one found by this Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. It applied the two parts of the test and, in addition, required the applicant to have already availed himself of his internal flight alternatives before he claimed refugee protection. A reading of the relevant passage of the decision shows that the RPD found that the applicant's refugee claim should fail on the ground that he did not avail himself of the internal flight alternatives before he claimed refugee protection in Canada. That constitutes an error.
[27]
Regarding the applicant's allegation that the RPD ignored the documentary evidence that it is possible, in Mexico, to obtain personal information, for example, someone's address, by paying members of the government, the RPD did not commit an error. In fact, the applicant cannot allege that the RPD did not consider documentary evidence on an element when there is nothing in his factual situation that corresponds to it. The RPD rendered a reasonable decision and did not commit an error by failing to address this specific problem because there is no evidence that suggests that that could be the applicant's situation (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CarswellNat 6562;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CarswellNat 3608). In fact, the evidence shows that Jesus Victorio Barrio is a livestock breeder and is not linked to a criminal organization, which demonstrates that it is unlikely that he used that means to try to locate the applicant.
[28]
Like the applicant stated, it seems that the RPD was confused in its interpretation of his testimony. The RPD understood that Jesus Victorio Barrio had been tried for murder and was therefore surprised to find that he did not serve a prison sentence. Furthermore, according to the RPD, given that he did not serve a sentence, Jesus Victorio Barrio would have no reason to harm the applicant. However, the applicant provided answers that demonstrate that he made no distinction between Jesus Victorio Barrio's trial and the acquittal of the three men.
[29]
The RPD's finding is erroneous and it had an impact on the result. In fact, the evidence shows that the applicant made a statement that led to the release of three innocent men and the issuance of a warrant to arrest Jesus Victorio Barrio. Thus, the RPD found that the applicant, by his actions, was able to aggravate Jesus Victorio Barrio. The current situation is that the applicant could be a key witness in the trial against Jesus Victorio Barrio, who is still free. The RPD's finding that he would not harm the applicant given that he is not serving a prison sentence after his conviction is based on a misinterpretation of the applicant's testimony, which impacted the issue of the applicant's internal flight alternative.
[30]
Thus, the two errors committed by the RPD, that is, the addition of a criterion to the test applicable to the internal flight alternative and the misinterpretation of the applicant's testimony that led to an erroneous finding make the decision unreasonable in the circumstances.
[31]
The parties were invited to submit a question for certification, but none was submitted.

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demande de contrôle judiciaire d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés [la SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié, rendue le 25 avril 2012, en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001 ch 27 [la LIPR]. La SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'est ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention aux termes de l'article 96 de la LIPR, ni une personne à protéger selon l'article 97 de la LIPR.
I.
Faits
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen mexicain. Le 12 juin 2005, il a été témoin du meurtre de Cirilo Morales Feliciano, un homme âgé de 16 ans qui était un ami. Lors des événements, le demandeur se trouvait avec un autre ami, Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez ainsi que Jesus Victorio Barrio, connu comme « El Navarro ». Durant la soirée, Jesus Victorio Barrio et Cirilo Morales Feliciano se sont disputés, ce dernier accusant Jesus Victorio Barrio d'être un voleur de chevaux et de bétail. Jesus Victorio Barrio a assailli Cirilo Morales Feliciano de coups de roches à la tête, ce qui l'a tué. Celui-ci a quitté les lieux et prévenu le demandeur ainsi que Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez de ne pas parler du meurtre, sous peine d'être assassinés. Lorsque des personnes se sont approchées pour comprendre qui avait tué Cirilo Morales Feliciano, le demandeur s'est rendu chez lui, de peur que Jesus Victorio Barrio revienne pour le tuer.
[3]
Suite à ces événements, le ministère public arrêta Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez ainsi que deux autres hommes qui se sont présentés à la scène du crime. Craignant pour sa vie, Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez a raconté que Cirilo Morales Feliciano a été attaqué par un groupe d'hommes provenant du village San Augustin, Cuilutla. Ainsi, la police procéda à l'arrestation de trois jeunes hommes de ce village.
[4]
Lorsque le demandeur apprit que trois hommes innocents avaient été arrêtés, il se présenta le 22 août 2005 au ministère public pour déposer une déclaration détaillée, accusant Jesus Victorio Barrio d'être le seul responsable du meurtre de Cirilo Morales Feliciano. Selon le demandeur, Jesus Victorio Barrio aurait corrompu certaines personnes afin d'éviter d'être arrêté pour le crime qu'il a commis.
[5]
Le 9 juillet 2007, le demandeur reçut une assignation à comparaître du ministère public, dans le procès des trois hommes accusés du meurtre de Cirilio Morales Feliciano. Il se sentit dans l'obligation de questionner Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez au sujet de sa fausse déclaration déposée auprès du ministère public. Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez expliqua donc que Jesus Victorio Barrio l'avait menacé de mort si jamais celui-ci disait la vérité.
[6]
Quelques mois plus tard, le demandeur apprit que les trois hommes accusés du meurtre de Cirilio Morales Feliciano seraient libérés. Cependant, en décembre 2007, il apprit que Jesus Victorio Barrio était retourné dans la région et qu'il avait proféré des menaces à l'égard de sa personne ainsi que de sa famille. Ainsi, le demandeur a quitté la région avec sa femme et ses deux enfants pour aller vivre à Chicoloapan, dans l'état de Mexico. Il obtint un poste de vendeur de vêtements dans un petit magasin. Il y loua une maison et inscrit ses enfants à l'école.
[7]
En mai 2008, le demandeur apprit que son ami Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez, qui avait déménagé à Guadalajara, dans l'État de Jalisco, avait été tué par balle. Suite à sa dénonciation, Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez avait été poursuivi à travers le pays par Jesus Victorio Barrio ou des personnes engagées par lui. Ainsi, le demandeur quitta le Mexique pour le Canada le 3 juillet 2008 et demanda l'asile le jour de son arrivée.
II.
Décision révisée
[8]
La SPR considéra que le demandeur n'est pas un réfugié, étant donné que la raison à la base de sa demande d'asile ne constitue pas un motif valable en vertu de la Convention. En ce qui a trait à la demande formulée en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR, la SPR conclut que le demandeur n'a pas établi, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le demandeur ferait l'objet de traitements cruels et inusités s'il retournait au Mexique.
[9]
À l'appui de sa demande, le demandeur a fourni une déclaration datée du 22 août 2005, remise au ministère public de l'État de Guerrero, dans laquelle il explique en détail le déroulement des événements du 12 juin 2005 qui ont mené à la mort de Cirilio Morales Feliciano. Il a aussi fourni une copie de l'assignation à comparaître datée du 9 juillet 2007, dans laquelle on voit qu'un procès criminel avait été intenté au sujet du meurtre de Cirilio Morales Feliciano. La SPR a ainsi jugé que le récit du demandeur est crédible et que Jesus Victorio Barrio a donc assassiné Cirilio Morales Feliciano.
[10]
La SPR a considéré qu'il semble curieux que Jesus Victorio Barrio ait été reconnu coupable de meurtre, mais qu'il n'ait pas été en prison et qu'il réside maintenant dans une ville proche de San Agustin, Cuilutla, où la famille du demandeur habite. Elle a aussi constaté que le demandeur ignore si Jesus Victorio Barrio est en liberté, car il a formulé un appel à l'égard du jugement le condamnant.
[11]
La SPR a considéré que le demandeur affirme que la mort de Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez ne peut être attribuée qu'à Jesus Victorio Barrio étant donné que celui-ci n'avait pas d'ennemis. Cependant, elle a aussi considéré que le demandeur a habité à Chicoloapan pendant quatre ans et demi, en restant toujours dans la même demeure. De plus, le demandeur a confirmé qu'il a gardé contact avec sa famille au Mexique et qu'ils n'ont pas été menacés.
[12]
La SPR a aussi considéré le fait que Jesus Victorio Barrio ainsi que sa famille travaillent comme éleveurs de bétail et qu'il n'a probablement ni l'intérêt ni la possibilité financière de rechercher le demandeur, d'autant plus qu'il n'a jamais été emprisonné pour le crime qu'il a commis. La SPR a donc conclu que le demandeur pourrait retourner à Chicoloapan, sans être exposé à un risque de traitement cruel et inusité. De plus, la SPR a considéré qu'étant donné que le demandeur a gagné sa vie à Chicoloapan pendant six mois avant de quitter le Mexique pour le Canada, il ne serait pas « objectivement déraisonnable » ou « trop sévère » de s'attendre à ce que le demandeur d'asile déménage à cet endroit.
III.
Position du demandeur
[13]
Le demandeur soumet que la décision de la SPR ne tient pas compte de la preuve à l'effet qu'il est possible de corrompre les fonctionnaires au Mexique afin d'obtenir des bases de données contenant de l'information confidentielle sur des tierces parties. Cette preuve aurait dû être examinée dans le cadre de l'analyse de la question de la possibilité de refuge intérieur étant donné que cela démontre que peu importe l'endroit où irait vivre le demandeur, il pourrait être localisé par Jesus Victorio Barrio. Ainsi, la SPR a commis une erreur, car c'était un élément de preuve très important.
[14]
De plus, le demandeur affirme que la SPR n'a pas considéré qu'au Mexique, le contexte dans lequel les personnes se trouvant dans la situation du demandeur est bien différent et a plutôt examiné la situation du demandeur d'un point de vue canadien. Le Mexique est une démocratie émergente.
[15]
Troisièmement, le demandeur allègue que la SPR a commis une erreur lors de l'évaluation du témoignage du demandeur. En effet, la SPR, dans sa décision, indique ne pas connaître la raison pour laquelle Jesus Victorio Barrio n'a pas purgé de peine d'emprisonnement pour meurtre, suite au verdict de culpabilité. Cependant, le demandeur a expliqué qu'il n'y a, à sa connaissance, qu'un mandat d'arrestation émis contre celui-ci et qu'il n'a pas été condamné par un tribunal mexicain pour le meurtre de Cirilio Morales Feliciano. Ainsi, la décision de la SPR, particulièrement en ce qui a trait à la possibilité de refuge intérieur, est erronée, car la SPR a tiré une inférence négative d'une conclusion de fait erronée. En effet, à la lecture des transcriptions de l'audience, il est clair que le demandeur, lorsque questionné au sujet de Jesus Victorio Barrio, se référait aux procédures impliquant les trois hommes accusés et que lorsqu'il prétend que celui-ci a été trouvé coupable, il se réfère en réalité aux trois hommes libérés suite à sa déposition au sujet de Jesus Victorio Barrio. Ainsi, il est clair que pour le demandeur, il n'y a pas de différence entre l'acquittement des trois hommes et le procès contre Jesus Victorio Barrio.
[16]
Quatrièmement, le demandeur soumet que la SPR a commis une erreur similaire à celle qui a été constatée par cette  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 188 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], car elle a rejeté la demande du demandeur sur la base du fait qu'il n'a pas épuisé une possibilité de refuge intérieur avant de demander l'asile au Canada. Elle a ainsi ajouté un critère au test développé par la jurisprudence au sujet de l'évaluation de la possibilité de refuge intérieur.
[17]
Toujours en ce qui a trait à la possibilité de refuge intérieur, le demandeur affirme que cette possibilité ne s'offre pas à lui étant donné que Jesus Victorio Barrio a été en mesure d'assassiner Gorgonio Ventura Vasquez, dans l'état de Jalisco et qu'il le soupçonne d'avoir engagé un tueur à gages pour le faire. Ainsi, Jesus Victorio Barrio aurait les moyens financiers de s'en prendre au demandeur. De plus, le demandeur a expliqué que Jesus Victorio Barrio appartient à une classe d'éleveurs supérieure à la sienne. Ainsi, la SPR a tiré une conclusion arbitraire, sans égard à la preuve soumise.
[18]
Enfin, étant donné que la SPR a considéré le demandeur comme étant crédible, cela aurait dû avoir un impact sur l'analyse de la question de la possibilité de refuge intérieur.
IV.
Position du défendeur
[19]
Le défendeur soumet que la SPR n'a commis aucune erreur en considérant que le demandeur a une possibilité de refuge intérieur à Chicoloapan, où il a trouvé refuge en décembre 2007 avec sa famille. Le test à deux volets établi dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a été appliqué de façon juste.
[20]
En ce qui a trait au premier volet du test, le demandeur n'a pas démontré selon la prépondérance des probabilités qu'il risque d'être persécuté ou qu'il s'expose à une menace à sa vie ou à un risque de traitement ou peines cruels et inusités à Chicoloapan. En effet, le demandeur y a vécu paisiblement depuis 2007 et il allègue que la SPR a valablement conclu que le demandeur n'a pas prouvé que Jesus Victorio Barrio tenterait ou aurait la volonté de tenter de le retrouver.
[21]
Pour ce qui est du second volet du test, la SPR a conclu, de façon juste, qu'il n'est pas déraisonnable que le demandeur se prévale de la possibilité de refuge intérieur à Chicoloapan, où il a déjà résidé avec sa famille avant de quitter le Mexique.
[22]
En ce qui a trait à l'argument du demandeur au sujet de l'incompréhension de la SPR du témoignage du demandeur au sujet de l'arrestation de Jesus Victorio Barrio, le défendeur affirme que celle-ci est sans incidence sur l'analyse de la SPR au sujet de la possibilité de refuge intérieur du demandeur.
V.
Question en litige
[23]
La SPR, a-t-elle erré en concluant que le demandeur a une possibilité de refuge intérieur ?
VI.
Norme de contrôle
[24]
La norme de la décision raisonnable est applicable à la décision de la SPR au sujet de la possibilité de refuge intérieur, car il s'agit d'une question de fait (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
VII.
Analyse
[25]
La SPR a rendu une décision déraisonnable pour les motifs qui suivent.
[26]
L'argument du demandeur à l'effet que la SPR a ajouté une condition au test applicable à la question de la possibilité de refuge intérieur est juste. En effet, la SPR a, en l'espèce, commis une erreur lors de l'application du test, laquelle est similaire à celle qui a été constatée par cette Cour dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. Elle a appliqué les deux volets de celui-ci et a, en sus, exigé que le demandeur ait déjà épuisé ses possibilités de refuge intérieur avant de faire sa demande d'asile. Une lecture du passage pertinent de la décision démontre que la SPR a conclu que la demande d'asile du demandeur devrait échouer pour le motif qu'il n'a pas épuisé des possibilités de refuge intérieur avant de présenter sa demande d'asile au Canada. Cela constitue une erreur.
[27]
En ce qui a trait à l'allégation du demandeur selon laquelle la SPR a fait abstraction de la preuve documentaire à l'effet qu'il est possible au Mexique, d'obtenir, en payant des membres du gouvernement, des informations personnelles, par exemple, l'adresse d'une personne, la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur. En effet, le demandeur ne peut alléguer que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de la preuve documentaire portant sur un élément lorsqu'il n'y a rien dans sa situation factuelle qui ne corresponde à celui-ci. La SPR a rendu une décision raisonnable et n'a pas commis une erreur en n'abordant pas cette problématique spécifique puisqu'aucune preuve soumise ne laisse envisager que ce pourrait être le cas du demandeur (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CarswellNat 6562;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CarswellNat 3608). En effet, la preuve est à l'effet que Jesus Victorio Barrio est un éleveur de bétail et qu'il n'est pas en lien avec une organisation criminelle, ce qui démontre qu'il est peu probable qu'il ait recours à ce moyen pour tenter de retracer le demandeur.
[28]
Comme l'affirme le demandeur, il semble qu'il y ait une confusion dans l'interprétation du témoignage du demandeur par la SPR. Celle-ci a compris que Jesus Victorio Barrio avait subi un procès pour meurtre et elle a donc été surprise de constater qu'il n'avait pas purgé de peine d'emprisonnement. De plus, selon celle-ci, étant donné qu'il n'a pas purgé de peine, Jesus Victorio Barrio n'aurait pas de raison de s'en prendre au demandeur. Cependant, le demandeur a donné des réponses qui démontrent qu'il ne faisait pas de distinction entre le procès de Jesus Victorio Barrio et l'acquittement des trois hommes.
[29]
Cette constatation de la SPR est erronée et a eu un impact sur l'issue du litige. En effet, la preuve est à l'effet que le demandeur a fait une déposition, qui a conduit à la libération de trois hommes innocents et à l'émission d'un mandat d'arrestation contre Jesus Victorio Barrio. Ainsi, la SPR n'a pas considéré que le demandeur, par ses agissements, a pu contrarier Jesus Victorio Barrio. La situation actuelle est à l'effet que le demandeur pourrait être un témoin clé dans le procès contre Jesus Victorio Barrio, lequel se trouve toujours en liberté. La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle ce dernier ne s'en prendrait pas au demandeur étant donné qu'il ne purge pas de peine d'emprisonnement, suite à sa condamnation est basée sur une mauvaise interprétation du témoignage du demandeur, ce qui a eu un impact sur, la question de la possibilité de refuge intérieur du demandeur.
[30]
Ainsi les deux erreurs commises par la SPR, soit l'ajout d'un critère au test applicable à la question de la possibilité de refuge intérieur et la mauvaise interprétation du témoignage du demandeur entraînant une conclusion erronée rendent la décision déraisonnable dans les circonstances.
[31]
Les parties furent invitées à soumettre une question aux fins de certification, mais aucune question ne fut proposée.
