Tremblay-Lamer, J.
: This application is for judicial review of a decision of the Appeal Division of the National Parole Board. The Appeal Division concluded that the Board had not erred in preventing a psychiatrist from giving viva voce evidence on behalf of the applicant at his detention hearing.
[2]
The applicant is incarcerated at Kingston Penitentiary, and absent a detention order, would have been entitled to statutory release on June 29, 1994. His sentence expires on April 1, 1996. After the Commissioner of Corrections issued a report recommending that the applicant be detained beyond his statutory release date, a detention hearing was scheduled before the National Parole Board (the "Board"). The hearing was adjourned several times to allow the applicant to arrange for a psychiatric assessment by a doctor of his own choosing. In a report dated June 9, 1994 the applicant's psychiatrist, Dr. Langevin, concluded that "[t]he results taken together reduce the risk of Mr. Diamond engaging in a sexually aggressive crime".
[3]
Prior to the hearing, the applicant requested that Dr. Langevin be present to answer any questions the Board might have. The Board responded that it had in place a policy indicating that psychiatric evidence was not to be heard orally, and that not even government psychiatrists were allowed to testify before the Board. Instead, Dr. Langevin was granted Observer status. The hearing was eventually held on June 14, 1994.
[4]
At the hearing, the applicant and his assistant made submissions for approximately forty minutes. Dr. Langevin's report was also entered into evidence, but he was not allowed to address the Board, although he was present. The Board concluded that, if released, the applicant was likely to commit an offence causing death or serious harm to another person before the expiration of his sentence, and that he should be detained following his statutory release date. The Appeal Division, on October 5, 1994, affirmed the Board's decision ordering detention.
[5]
The applicant submits that the Appeal Division made three errors in affirming the decision of the Board:
1. The Board fettered its discretion by following a policy;
2. The Board failed to observe the principles of natural justice;
3. The Board deprived the applicant of his liberty contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.
1. Did The Board Fetter Its Discretion?
[6]
The applicant submits that the denial of his request to have Dr. Langevin make oral submissions at the hearing was made based on extraneous considerations, and without considering the merits of the request. Thus, the Board fettered its discretion by blindly following a policy.
[7]
In my view, this argument is without merit. The policy was created pursuant to the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, S.C. 1992, c. 20. The
Act
allows for the establishment of procedures to be followed at a detention hearing pursuant to s. 151(2)(a). Such procedures are essential as they allow prisoners to know in advance how their hearing will be conducted. As stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at 184.
"There are on the one hand cases where a tribunal in the honest exercise of its discretion has adopted a policy, and, without refusing to hear an applicant, intimates to him what its policy is, and that after hearing him it will in accordance with its policy decide against him, unless there is something exceptional in his case ... [I]f the policy has been adopted for reasons which the tribunal may legitimately entertain, no objection could be taken to such a course."
I find this reasoning persuasive.
[8]
Moreover, the policy in question is entirely procedural in nature. The court may be more willing to interfere with a tribunal's blind adherence to a substantive policy [see footnote 1], but procedural policies can be followed by a tribunal with less risk of judicial interference.
[9]
The applicant's case was decided on its merits before the Board. The written evidence of Dr. Langevin was before the tribunal, and the applicant and his assistant were able to elaborate or clarify any information in the doctor's report. In my view, the Board did not fetter its discretion by refusing to hear oral evidence from Dr. Langevin.
2. Did The Board Fail To Observe The
Principles Of Natural Justice?
[10]
Fairness is a flexible concept. Its content varies with individual circumstances, and depends on the nature of the inquiry and its consequences (See
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .). The question in the case at bar is whether at a detention hearing before the Board, natural justice requires that an applicant's psychiatrist be allowed to make oral submissions.
[11]
The situation is such that the applicant and his assistant could make oral submissions, and although Dr. Langevin was present at the hearing, the applicant and doctor knew that Dr. Langevin could only observe the proceedings. Moreover, Dr. Langevin could make written submissions, and therefore his evidence was before the Board. The report could have been clarified orally by the applicant or his assistant. The applicant could even have relayed the doctor's submissions to the Board because the standard rules of evidence do not restrict the Board [see footnote 2].
[12]
The applicant relies heavily on the decision of Wetston, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Board to hear oral psychiatric evidence amounted to a breach of natural justice as well as a violation of the prisoner's constitutional rights. That case is distinguishable from the case at bar. The applicant is serving a sentence with a finite term. His incarceration will end within one year. Mr. MacInnis was the object of an indeterminate sentence. His only option for release was parole. The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that prisoners subject to an indeterminate sentence are different than other prisoners ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.S.R.(2d) 271; 207 A.P.R. 271.). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> recognized this difference and decided that in this special circumstance, the content of natural justice included psychiatric oral submissions.
[13]
The case at bar, does not involve the special circumstances apparent in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Therefore, in my view the threshold for a breach of natural justice is lower. No denial of natural justice has occurred.
3. Have The Applicant's Charter Rights
Been Violated?
[14]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 243, at 151, the Supreme Court concluded,
"The principles of fundamental justice are concerned not only with the interest of the person who claims his liberty has been limited, but with the protection of society. Fundamental justice requires that a fair balance be struck between these interests, both substantively and procedurally (see
Re B.C.
Motor Vehicle Act
, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at pp. 502-503, per  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 212, per  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 882, per Iacobucci, J.)."
In my view, a fair balance has been struck procedurally by a policy that allows a prisoner to adduce written psychiatric evidence before the Board, but does not allow oral submissions by the doctor. I am of this view for the same reasons I concluded that a breach of natural justice had not occurred.
Conclusion
[15]
I am satisfied that in the present situation the Board made its decision in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, and that the Appeal Division did not err in affirming the Board's decision.
[16]
Therefore, the application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
