Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Gleason, J.
: The applicant is a 68-year old citizen of the United States, who was employed for a number of years as a software engineer in Canada. He lost his job in 2010 due to corporate restructuring and thereafter engaged in a lengthy job search. He applied for a permanent resident visa under the Federal Skilled Worker program, which was rejected by an immigration officer of the Consulate General of Canada, Immigration Section, in New York City on June 20, 2012. The officer (with the requisite concurrence of another officer) determined that despite the applicant's exceeding the minimum number of points (being awarded 74 out of 100 when only 67 are required), a substituted evaluation would be issued under subsection 76(3) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 [the Regulations]. The officer noted in this regard that the applicant had been unsuccessful in his 22-month job search and concluded that in light of this fact and the applicant's profile, the applicant was not likely to be successful in becoming economically established in Canada. The applicant's permanent residence application was therefore rejected.
[2]
In this application for judicial review, the applicant seeks to set aside the rejection decision, arguing that his procedural fairness rights were violated and that the decision is unreasonable.
[3]
In terms of procedural fairness, the applicant asserts that the officer who interviewed him was under a duty to warn him of the concerns in advance of the interview so as to afford the applicant time to prepare his response and that the failure to warn him amounts to a denial of procedural fairness. The applicant also argues that he implicitly requested the opportunity to provide additional information during the interview but was denied the opportunity to do so, which he likewise claims violated his rights to procedural fairness. In terms of the reasonableness of the decision reached, the applicant argues that the officers erred in their substituted evaluation by ignoring relevant evidence and by failing to conduct the assessment in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations.
[4]
For the reasons set out below, I have determined that none of these arguments has merit and, accordingly, that this application for judicial review will be dismissed.
Relevant Statutory Provisions
[5]
Prior to addressing the applicant's arguments, it is useful to reproduce the provisions under which this decision was made to provide context to the applicant's arguments. The relevant provisions are contained in subsection 12(2) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA] and section 76 of the Regulations.
[6]
Subsection 12(2) of the IRPA provides:
A foreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.
La sélection des étrangers de la catégorie « immigration économique » se fait en fonction de leur capacité à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada.
[7]
The relevant portions of section 76 of the Regulations state:
Selection criteria
76. (1) For the purpose of determining whether a skilled worker, as a member of the federal skilled worker class, will be able to become economically established in Canada, they must be assessed on the basis of the following criteria:
(a) the skilled worker must be awarded not less than the minimum number of required points referred to in subsection (2) on the basis of the following factors, namely,
(i) education, in accordance with section 78,
(ii) proficiency in the official languages of Canada, in accordance with section 79,
(iii) experience, in accordance with section 80,
(iv) age, in accordance with section 81,
(v) arranged employment, in accordance with section 82, and
(vi) adaptability, in accordance with section 83; and
(b) the skilled worker must
(i) have in the form of transferable and available funds, unencumbered by debts or other obligations, an amount equal to half the minimum necessary income applicable in respect of the group of persons consisting of the skilled worker and their family members, or
(ii) be awarded the number of points referred to in subsection 82(2) for arranged employment in Canada within the meaning of subsection 82(1).
[...]
Circumstances for officer's substituted evaluation
(3) Whether or not the skilled worker has been awarded the minimum number of required points referred to in subsection (2), an officer may substitute for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(a) their evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada if the number of points awarded is not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker may become economically established in Canada.
Concurrence
(4) An evaluation made under subsection (3) requires the concurrence of a second officer.
Critères de sélection
76. (1) Les critères ci-après indiquent que le travailleur qualifié peut réussir son établissement économique au Canada à titre de membre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral):
a) le travailleur qualifié accumule le nombre minimum de points visé au paragraphe (2), au titre des facteurs suivants:
(i) les études, aux termes de l'article 78,
(ii) la compétence dans les langues officielles du Canada, aux termes de l'article 79,
(iii) l'expérience, aux termes de l'article 80,
(iv) l'âge, aux termes de l'article 81,
(v) l'exercice d'un emploi réservé, aux termes de l'article 82,
(vi) la capacité d'adaptation, aux termes de l'article 83;
b) le travailleur qualifié:
(i) soit dispose de fonds transférables - non grevés de dettes ou d'autres obligations financières - d'un montant égal à la moitié du revenu vital minimum qui lui permettrait de subvenir à ses propres besoins et à ceux des membres de sa famille,
(ii) soit s'est vu attribuer le nombre de points prévu au paragraphe 82(2) pour un emploi réservé au Canada au sens du paragraphe 82(1).
[...]
Substitution de l'appréciation de l'agent à la grille
(3) Si le nombre de points obtenu par un travailleur qualifié - que celui-ci obtienne ou non le nombre minimum de points visé au paragraphe (2) - n'est pas un indicateur suffisant de l'aptitude de ce travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique au Canada, l'agent peut substituer son appréciation aux critères prévus à l'alinéa (1)a).
Confirmation
(4) Toute décision de l'agent au titre du paragraphe (3) doit être confirmée par un autre agent.
Standard of review
[8]
The first issue which must be determined is the standard of review applicable to the assessment of the errors alleged by the applicant. In terms of the first, no deference is owed to the officer on the question of whether the officer violated the applicant's rights to procedural fairness as the matter is one for determination by the reviewing court (
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). On the other hand, the reasonableness standard of review applies to the assessment of whether the officers erred in their assessment under section 76 of the Regulations (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). The reasonableness standard is a deferential one and requires that the reviewing court not substitute its views for those of the administrative decision-maker if the reasons offered are transparent, intelligible and justified and the result reached falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes in light of the facts and applicable law (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Newfoundland Nurses
] at paras 11-13).
Was there a denial of procedural fairness?
[9]
Turning, then, to consideration of the claimed procedural fairness violation, procedural fairness is premised on the principle that those involved in an adjudicative process should be provided with an opportunity to fairly present their claims. This generally requires that parties be afforded an opportunity to respond to issues they could not reasonably have expected to arise that will impact upon decisions affecting their interests. The determination of how this opportunity must be afforded is context-dependent and will vary from one tribunal to another and from case to case (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 21).
[10]
In the context of decisions like the present one, the case law establishes that a visa officer need not give notice of unanticipated concerns (i.e. those that do not directly arise from the application of the Regulations) prior to an interview so long as the concerns are raised during the interview and the applicant is given an opportunity to address them. Where the applicant reasonably requests time to provide additional evidence or submissions after the interview, the applicant must be afforded this opportunity (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. LR (3d) 221 (TD)).
[11]
It follows, therefore, that the first alleged violation of procedural fairness, involving the claim that the interviewing officer erred in not providing advance notice of the concerns to the applicant, is without merit. The case law recognizes that such concerns may indeed be raised for the first time during the interview, itself. Accordingly, there was nothing improper in the officer raising his concerns - and the possibility of a substituted evaluation - for the first time during the interview of the applicant.
[12]
The second claimed violation of procedural fairness involves the assertion that the applicant requested but was not afforded the opportunity to present additional evidence after the interview. Assessment of this claim requires examination of the evidence regarding what transpired during and subsequent to the interview.
[13]
Both the applicant and the officer who interviewed him have filed affidavits, which provide differing evidence as to what transpired during the interview. Neither was cross-examined.
[14]
The officer deposes that, upon being advised of the concerns regarding the difficulty the officer feared the applicant would likely face in achieving economic self-sufficiency, the applicant provided evidence of a job interview he had recently scheduled, discussed his job search and the fact that many companies preferred hiring permanent residents and indicated that he could file evidence of other similar advertisements, where other employers required job applicants to be Canadian citizens or permanent residents. The officer, notably, does not indicate in his affidavit that the applicant stated that he wished to file additional evidence on any other matter or that had he known of the officer's concerns would have filed additional evidence regarding additional job interviews and contacts with recruiters.
[15]
The applicant, on the other hand, does so depose in his affidavit. He states as follows at paragraph 15 of his affidavit: "I told the officer during the interview that if I had known that my efforts to find employment were going to be an issue with him, and used as a basis to deny my application, that I would have brought evidence of the numerous jobs I had applied for since being laid off, including evidence of interviews I attended and contacts with recruiters".
[16]
It is unnecessary for me to determine which of these two versions of the events I prefer, because even if the applicant's version is accepted, I do not find there to have been a violation of procedural fairness in the circumstances of this case. In this regard, the applicant did file additional evidence with the interviewing officer, subsequent to the interview, that the officer and his superior both considered prior to finalizing the decision that a substituted evaluation would be made under subsection 76(3) of the Regulations.
[17]
This additional evidence consisted of a letter dated May 31, 2012, in which the applicant set forth arguments as to why a substituted evaluation should not be made. However, the applicant did not provide any additional evidence of his job search, interviews or contacts with recruiters in his letter. While these matters might well be relevant to the substituted evaluation as the applicant argues, the fact is that the applicant was provided with an opportunity to put this evidence before the officers and failed to do so. He therefore cannot claim that his rights to procedural fairness were denied. He was afforded an opportunity to address the concerns surrounding the likelihood of his becoming economically self-sufficient if granted permanent resident status in Canada.
[18]
Thus, the first ground of review advanced by the applicant is without merit.
Did the officers ignore relevant evidence?
[19]
The applicant argues in the second place that the officers ignored relevant evidence, namely, evidence of the job interview he was scheduled to undergo with Abbot, the Honeywell job advertisement he filed and his LinkedIn profile. He asserts that these pieces of evidence were ignored by the officers as they were not specifically mentioned in the letter advising of the rejection of his application and are all relevant to the decision.
[20]
This argument is without merit for two reasons. First, the interviewing officer did mention these pieces of evidence in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System [CAIPS] notes (which form part of the reasons for decision). Thus, on the facts, the evidence was not ignored. Second, and perhaps more importantly, there is simply no need for a tribunal to specifically discuss every piece of evidence in its reasons. As stated by Justice Abella for the Supreme Court of Canada in
Newfoundland Nurses
at para 16:
Reasons may not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that does not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result under a reasonableness analysis. A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion [...] In other words, if the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria are met.
[21]
Similarly, and more recently, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Supreme Court held:
The Board did not have to explicitly address all possible shades of meaning of these provisions. This Court has strongly emphasized that administrative tribunals do not have to consider and comment upon every issue raised by the parties in their reasons. For reviewing courts, the issue remains whether the decision, viewed as a whole in the context of the record, is reasonable. [Citations omitted.]
(See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .) Thus, contrary to what the applicant asserts, the decision is not rendered unreasonable through a failure to adequately address portions of the evidence.
Did the officer incorrectly exercise his discretion under subsection 76(3) of the Regulations?
[22]
The applicant finally argues that the officers premised the exercise of their discretion under subsection 76(3) of the Regulations on an incorrect interpretation of the section 76, which requires that the discretion to issue a substituted evaluation be premised on the factors listed in paragraph 76(1)(a) of the Regulations. The applicant asserts that instead of focussing on the required factors, the officers incorrectly focused exclusively on the fact that the applicant had not obtained employment, which is not required under section 76 of the Regulations. The applicant notes in this regard that there is an entirely separate class is available for those with pre-arranged employment in Canada to obtain permanent resident status (under section 82 of the Regulations).
[23]
The decision of Justice Mandamin in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  does provide that in the exercise of their statutory discretion under subsection 76(3) of the Regulations, visa officers should have regard to the factors listed in paragraph 76(1)(a) of the Regulations in determining whether an applicant is likely to become economically self-sufficient. A somewhat broader test is posited in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where Justices Tremblay-Lamer and Justice O'Keefe noted that in the exercise of their discretion visa officers are considering whether, despite the points awarded under paragraph 76(1)(a) of the Regulations, an applicant is likely to become economically established in Canada.
[24]
Regardless of how the test is formulated, I believe that the officers in this case did not err by considering irrelevant factors. Contrary to what the applicant asserts, it was not the fact that the applicant had no job that concerned the officers. Rather, they were concerned that the lengthy job search had yielded no result. As the respondent rightly notes, the length of the search logically leads to the conclusion that the applicant would be unlikely to ever find work or was unlikely to become economically self-sufficient.
[25]
A similar finding was upheld in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where a substituted decision based on an applicant's having failed to engage in a job search was found to be reasonable. There, Justice Tremblay-Lamer wrote at paragraphs 19 and 20:
[19] The officer was concerned not only about the applicant's ability to find employment in Canada, but also her willingness in that regard. These concerns were not based solely on the applicant's age. Instead, the officer considered the applicant's age in combination with a number of other circumstances, including: that the applicant had already effectively retired in the UK, that despite having lived in Canada for two years she had not taken concrete steps towards certification or towards securing future employment in Canada, and that the applicant's husband had been offered work in Canada but that an "LMO for his line of unskilled work [had] not been issued for a second stay".
[20] Ultimately, the role of this Court is not to substitute its own view for that of the immigration officer. I cannot find that the officer's decision to substitute a negative determination under subsection 76(3) of the Regulations lacked justification, transparency or intelligibility or fell outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law. As such, this application for judicial review is dismissed.
[26]
In my view, identical reasoning applies here and, accordingly, the final argument advanced by the applicant is without merit.
[27]
This application for judicial review will accordingly be dismissed.
[28]
No question for certification under section 74 of the IRPA was presented and none arises as this decision is tied to the facts of this case.
JUDGMENT
[29]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. This application for judicial review is dismissed;
2. No question of general importance is certified; and
3. There is no order as to costs.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur est un citoyen des États-Unis âgé de 68 ans qui a travaillé pendant un certain nombre d'années au Canada comme ingénieur logiciel. Après avoir perdu son emploi en 2010 à la suite d'une réorganisation de société, il a entrepris une longue recherche d'emploi. Le 20 juin 2012, il a présenté une demande de visa de résident permanent au Canada dans le cadre du Programme des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). Cette demande a été rejetée par un agent d'immigration travaillant au consulat général du Canada, section de l'immigration, à New York. L'agent (avec l'approbation requise d'un autre agent) a décidé que, même si le demandeur avait obtenu plus que le nombre minimal de points requis (il avait obtenu 74 points sur 100 alors que seulement 67 points sont exigés), il procèderait à une substitution d'appréciation en application du paragraphe 76(3) du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 [le Règlement]. L'agent a souligné à cet égard que le demandeur n'avait pas réussi à se trouver un emploi au cours des 22 mois où il a cherché un emploi et il a conclu que, compte tenu de ce fait, et compte tenu du profil du demandeur, le demandeur ne réussirait vraisemblablement pas son établissement économique au Canada. La demande de résidence permanente présentée par le demandeur a donc été rejetée.
[2]
Dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire, le demandeur sollicite l'annulation de la décision de rejet, car il prétend qu'elle est déraisonnable et que ses droits à l'équité procédurale ont été violés.
[3]
En ce qui concerne l'équité procédurale, le demandeur prétend que l'agent qui l'a passé en entrevue était tenu de lui faire part de ses préoccupations, avant la tenue de l'entrevue afin de lui permettre de préparer sa réponse, et que l'omission de ce faire équivalait à un déni d'équité procédurale. Le demandeur prétend également qu'il a explicitement demandé qu'on lui donne la possibilité de fournir des renseignements supplémentaires durant l'entrevue, mais qu'on ne lui en a pas donné l'occasion, ce qui, selon lui, violait également ses droits à l'équité procédurale. En ce qui concerne le caractère raisonnable de la décision rendue, le demandeur prétend que les agents ont commis une erreur dans leur substitution d'appréciation en ne tenant pas compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents et en n'effectuant pas l'examen en conformité avec les exigences du Règlement.
[4]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, j'ai décidé qu'aucun de ces arguments n'est fondé et que, par conséquent, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire sera rejetée.
Les dispositions législatives pertinentes
[5]
Avant d'examiner les arguments du demandeur, il est utile de reproduire les dispositions en vertu desquelles la décision en litige a été prise afin de situer en contexte les arguments du demandeur. Les dispositions pertinentes figurent au paragraphe 12(2) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR], et à l'article 76 du Règlement.
[6]
Le paragraphe 12(2) de la LIPR prévoit ce qui suit:
La sélection des étrangers de la catégorie « immigration économique » se fait en fonction de leur capacité à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada.
A foreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.
[7]
Les parties pertinentes de l'article 76 du Règlement sont ainsi libellées:
Critères de sélection
76. (1) Les critères ci-après indiquent que le travailleur qualifié peut réussir son établissement économique au Canada à titre de membre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral):
a) le travailleur qualifié accumule le nombre minimum de points visé au paragraphe (2), au titre des facteurs suivants:
(i) les études, aux termes de l'article 78,
(ii) la compétence dans les langues officielles du Canada, aux termes de l'article 79,
(iii) l'expérience, aux termes de l'article 80,
(iv) l'âge, aux termes de l'article 81,
(v) l'exercice d'un emploi réservé, aux termes de l'article 82,
(vi) la capacité d'adaptation, aux termes de l'article 83;
b) le travailleur qualifié:
(i) soit dispose de fonds transférables - non grevés de dettes ou d'autres obligations financières - d'un montant égal à la moitié du revenu vital minimum qui lui permettrait de subvenir à ses propres besoins et à ceux des membres de sa famille,
(ii) soit s'est vu attribuer le nombre de points prévu au paragraphe 82(2) pour un emploi réservé au Canada au sens du paragraphe 82(1).
[...]
Substitution de l'appréciation de l'agent à la grille
(3) Si le nombre de points obtenu par un travailleur qualifié - que celui-ci obtienne ou non le nombre minimum de points visé au paragraphe (2) - n'est pas un indicateur suffisant de l'aptitude de ce travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique au Canada, l'agent peut substituer son appréciation aux critères prévus à l'alinéa (1)a).
Confirmation
(4) Toute décision de l'agent au titre du paragraphe (3) doit être confirmée par un autre agent.
Selection criteria
76. (1) For the purpose of determining whether a skilled worker, as a member of the federal skilled worker class, will be able to become economically established in Canada, they must be assessed on the basis of the following criteria:
(a) the skilled worker must be awarded not less than the minimum number of required points referred to in subsection (2) on the basis of the following factors, namely,
(i) education, in accordance with section 78,
(ii) proficiency in the official languages of Canada, in accordance with section 79,
(iii) experience, in accordance with section 80,
(iv) age, in accordance with section 81,
(v) arranged employment, in accordance with section 82, and
(vi) adaptability, in accordance with section 83; and
(b) the skilled worker must
(i) have in the form of transferable and available funds, unencumbered by debts or other obligations, an amount equal to half the minimum necessary income applicable in respect of the group of persons consisting of the skilled worker and their family members, or
(ii) be awarded the number of points referred to in subsection 82(2) for arranged employment in Canada within the meaning of subsection 82(1).
[...]
Circumstances for officer's substituted evaluation
(3) Whether or not the skilled worker has been awarded the minimum number of required points referred to in subsection (2), an officer may substitute for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(a) their evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada if the number of points awarded is not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker may become economically established in Canada.
Concurrence
(4) An evaluation made under subsection (3) requires the concurrence of a second officer.
LA NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[8]
La première question qui doit être tranchée est celle qui consiste à savoir quelle norme de contrôle il convient d'appliquer à l'évaluation des erreurs alléguées par le demandeur. En ce qui concerne la première question, il n'y a pas lieu de faire preuve de retenue judiciaire à l'égard de la décision de l'agent quant à la question de savoir si celui-ci a violé les droits du demandeur à l'équité procédurale, car l'affaire doit être tranchée par la cour de révision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Par contre, la norme de contrôle de la raisonnabilité s'applique à la question de savoir si les agents ont commis une erreur dans l'évaluation qu'ils ont faite en conformité avec l'article 76 du Règlement (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ). La norme de la raisonnabilité est une norme qui commande la retenue et qui exige que la cour de révision ne peut pas substituer ses opinions à ceux du décideur administratif si les motifs offerts sont transparents, intelligibles et justifiés et que la décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables au regard des faits et du droit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Newfoundland Nurses
], aux paragraphes 11-13).
Y a-t-il eu déni d'équité procédurale?
[9]
En ce qui concerne l'examen de la question de la prétendue violation de l'équité procédurale, l'équité procédurale est fondée sur le principe que les personnes qui participent à un processus d'adjudication devraient avoir la possibilité de présenter équitablement leurs arguments. Pour ce faire, il faut généralement que les parties aient la possibilité de répondre aux questions auxquelles elles n'auraient pas pu raisonnablement s'attendre à ce qu'elles soient soulevées et qui ont une incidence sur les décisions touchant leurs intérêts. La détermination de la manière selon laquelle cette occasion doit être donnée dépend du contexte et variera d'un tribunal à l'autre et d'un cas à l'autre (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 21).
[10]
Dans le contexte des décisions comme celle dont il est question en l'espèce, la jurisprudence établit qu'un agent des visas n'a pas à faire part à l'avance de préoccupations imprévues (c'est-à-dire celles qui ne découlent pas directement de l'application du Règlement) avant une entrevue tant que celles-ci sont soulevées au cours de l'entrevue et que le demandeur a la possibilité d'y répondre. Lorsque le demandeur demande, avec raison, qu'on lui accorde du temps pour fournir des renseignements ou formuler des observations additionnelles après l'entrevue, on doit lui accorder cette possibilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. LR (3d) 221 (1re inst.)).
[11]
Il s'ensuit donc que la première prétention de violation de l'équité procédurale, voulant que l'agent qui a procédé à l'entrevue ait commis une erreur en ne faisant pas part à l'avance de ses préoccupations au demandeur, est sans fondement. La jurisprudence reconnaît que ces préoccupations peuvent être soulevées pour la première fois au cours de l'entrevue elle-même. Par conséquent, il était tout à fait légitime que l'agent fasse part de ses préoccupations, et qu'il ait la possibilité de substituer son appréciation, pour la première fois, lors de l'entrevue accordée au demandeur.
[12]
La deuxième prétention de violation de l'équité procédurale a trait au fait que le demandeur aurait demandé en vain qu'on lui donne la possibilité de présenter des éléments de preuve additionnels après l'entrevue. L'appréciation de cette prétention requiert un examen de la preuve concernant ce qui s'est passé durant et après l'entrevue.
[13]
Le demandeur et l'agent qui l'a interrogé ont déposé des affidavits comportant des témoignages différents quant à ce qui s'est passé au cours de l'entrevue. Ni l'un ni l'autre n'a été contre-interrogé.
[14]
L'agent déclare que, le demandeur, après avoir été informé de ses préoccupations quant à la difficulté qu'il aurait à devenir autonome sur le plan financier, a fourni une preuve concernant une entrevue d'emploi qu'il avait récemment obtenue, a parlé de sa recherche d'emploi et du fait que de nombreuses sociétés préfèrent embaucher des résidents permanents, et a mentionné qu'il pouvait présenter des preuves quant à d'autres annonces dans lesquelles les employeurs exigeaient que les candidats soient citoyens canadiens ou résidents permanents. L'agent, notamment, ne mentionne pas dans son affidavit que le demandeur a déclaré qu'il désirait déposer des éléments de preuve additionnels sur toute autre question ou que, s'il avait été au courant des préoccupations de l'agent, il aurait déposé des éléments de preuve additionnels concernant d'autres entrevues d'emploi et d'autres échanges avec des recruteurs.
[15]
Le demandeur, par contre, fait une telle mention dans son affidavit. Il déclare ce qui suit au paragraphe 15 de son affidavit: [traduction] « J'ai dit à l'agent, au cours de l'entrevue, que si j'avais su qu'il avait des doutes quant aux démarches que je faisais afin de trouver un emploi et que ceux-ci avaient servi de fondement au rejet de ma demande, j'aurais présenté des preuves quant aux nombreux emplois sur lesquels j'ai postulé depuis mon licenciement et des preuves quant aux entrevues que j'ai passées et des démarches que j'ai faites auprès de recruteurs ».
[16]
Je n'ai pas à décider laquelle de ces deux versions des événements je préfère parce que, même si j'accepte la version du demandeur, il n'y a pas eu, selon moi, violation de l'équité procédurale dans les circonstances de l'espèce. À cet égard, le demandeur a bel et bien soumis, après l'entrevue, à l'agent qui a procédé à l'entrevue, un élément de preuve que l'agent et son supérieur ont tous les deux examinés avant de décider qu'une substitution d'appréciation serait faite en application du paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement.
[17]
Cet élément de preuve additionnel consistait en une lettre, datée du 31 mai 2012, dans laquelle le demandeur formulait des arguments quant à savoir pourquoi une substitution d'appréciation devrait être faite. Toutefois, dans sa lettre, le demandeur ne faisait mention d'aucun élément de preuve additionnel quant à sa recherche d'emploi, quant à des entrevues ou quant à des démarches qu'il aurait effectuées auprès de recruteurs. Même si, comme le prétend le demandeur, les arguments qu'il a formulés peuvent être pertinents en ce qui concerne la substitution d'évaluation, le fait est qu'il a eu la possibilité de soumettre l'élément de preuve en question aux agents et ne l'a pas fait. Il ne peut donc pas prétendre que ses droits à l'équité procédurale ont été bafoués. Il a eu la possibilité de dissiper les doutes concernant la possibilité qu'il devienne économiquement autonome s'il obtenait le statut de résident permanent au Canada.
[18]
Par conséquent, le premier motif de contrôle avancé par le demandeur n'a aucun fondement.
Les agents ont-ils fait abstraction d'éléments de preuve pertinents?
[19]
Le demandeur prétend, en second lieu, que les agents n'ont pas tenu compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents, à savoir la preuve de l'entrevue d'emploi qu'il était censé passer avec Abbot, l'annonce d'emploi affichée par Honeywell et son profil sur LinkedIn. Il prétend que ces éléments de preuve n'ont pas été pris en compte par les agents, car ils n'étaient pas expressément mentionnés dans la lettre l'informant du rejet de sa demande et qu'ils sont tous pertinents quant à la décision.
[20]
Cet argument est dénué de fondement pour deux raisons. Premièrement, l'agent qui a procédé à l'entrevue a fait mention de ces éléments de preuve dans les notes du système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration [STIDI] (qui font partie des motifs de la décision). Par conséquent, compte tenu des faits, les éléments de preuve en question ont été pris en compte. Deuxièmement, peut-être plus important encore, il est tout simplement inutile qu'un tribunal fasse expressément mention de chaque élément de preuve dans ses motifs. Comme l'a déclaré la juge Abella de la Cour suprême du Canada au paragraphe 16 de l'arrêt

Il se peut que les motifs ne fassent pas référence à tous les arguments, dispositions législatives, précédents ou autres détails que le juge siégeant en révision aurait voulu y lire, mais cela ne met pas en doute leur validité ni celle du résultat au terme de l'analyse du caractère raisonnable de la décision. Le décideur n'est pas tenu de tirer une conclusion explicite sur chaque élément constitutif du raisonnement, si subordonné soit-il, qui a mené à sa conclusion finale [...] En d'autres termes, les motifs répondent aux critères établis dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s'ils permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables.
[21]
Dans le même ordre d'idées, plus récemment, la Cour suprême a conclu ce qui suit au paragraphe 3 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
La Commission n'était pas tenue de traiter expressément de toutes les interprétations possibles de ces dispositions. Notre Cour a insisté sur le fait qu'un tribunal administratif n'a pas l'obligation d'examiner et de commenter dans ses motifs chaque argument soulevé par les parties. La question que doit trancher le tribunal judiciaire siégeant en révision demeure celle de savoir si la décision attaquée, considérée dans son ensemble, à la lumière du dossier, est raisonnable. [Références omises]
(voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Par conséquent, contrairement à ce que prétend le demandeur, la décision n'est pas jugée déraisonnable parce qu'on a omis d'examiner adéquatement des parties de la preuve.
L'agent a-t-il mal exercé le pouvoir discrétionnaire que lui confère le paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement?
[22]
Enfin, le demandeur prétend que les agents ont fondé l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire qui leur est conféré par le paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement sur une interprétation erronée de l'article 76. Cet article exige que le pouvoir de procéder à une substitution d'appréciation soit fondé sur les facteurs énumérés à l'alinéa 76(1)
a
) du Règlement. Le demandeur prétend que plutôt que de se concentrer sur les facteurs requis, les agents se sont plutôt attachés, à tort, exclusivement sur le fait que le demandeur n'avait obtenu aucun emploi, ce qui n'est pas exigé par l'article 76 du Règlement. Le demandeur souligne à cet égard qu'il existe une catégorie tout à fait distincte qui permet aux personnes qui ont un emploi réservé au Canada d'obtenir le statut de résident permanent (article 82 du Règlement).
[23]
La décision rendue par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  prévoit que, dans le cadre de l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire que leur confère le paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement, les agents des visas doivent tenir compte des facteurs énumérés à l'alinéa 76(1)
a
) du Règlement en déterminant si un demandeur a des chances de devenir économiquement autonome. Un critère un peu plus large est énoncé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , où les juges Tremblay-Lamer et O'Keefe ont souligné que, dans le cadre de l'exercice de leur pouvoir discrétionnaire, les agents des visas se demandent si, malgré les points accordés en vertu de l'alinéa 76(1)
a
) du Règlement, le demandeur a des chances de réussir son établissement économique au Canada.
[24]
Peu importe comment le critère est formulé, j'estime que les agents en cause en l'espèce n'ont pas commis l'erreur de prendre en compte des facteurs non pertinents. Contrairement à ce que prétend le demandeur, ce n'est pas le fait que le demandeur n'avait aucun emploi qui préoccupait les agents. Ils étaient plutôt préoccupés par le fait que la longue recherche d'emploi n'avait pas porté fruit. Comme le défendeur le souligne à juste titre, la longue durée de la recherche mène logiquement à la conclusion que le demandeur ne trouvera probablement jamais de travail ou a peu de chance de devenir économiquement autonome.
[25]
Une conclusion semblable a été tirée dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , où une substitution d'appréciation fondée sur le fait que le demandeur n'avait fait aucune recherche d'emploi a été jugée raisonnable. La juge Tremblay-Lamer a écrit ce qui suit aux paragraphes 19 et 20:
L'agente était non seulement préoccupée quant à la capacité de la demanderesse de trouver un emploi au Canda, mais aussi quant à sa volonté à cet égard. Ces préoccupations n'étaient pas juste fondées sur l'âge de la demanderesse. L'agente a plutôt tenu compte de l'âge de la demanderesse en combinaison avec d'autres circonstances, y compris: que la demanderesse avait effectivement déjà pris sa retraite au R.-U.; qu'elle n'avait pas entrepris de démarches concrètes visant à obtenir la certification ou trouver un futur emploi au pays, en dépit du fait qu'elle avait vécu au Canada pendant deux ans, et que l'époux de la demanderesse s'était fait offrir du travail au Canada, mais qu'un [traduction] « AMT pour son domaine de travail non spécialisé n'[avait] pas été délivré pour un deuxième séjour ».
Au bout du compte, le rôle de la Cour n'est pas de substituer son opinion à celle de l'agente d'immigration. Je ne peux conclure que la décision de l'agente d'immigration de substituer une appréciation négative, en vertu du paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement, aux critères prévus manquait de justification, de transparence ou d'intelligibilité, ou qu'elle n'appartenait pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Par conséquent, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire sera rejetée.
[26]
Selon moi, un raisonnement identique trouve application en l'espèce et, par conséquent, le dernier argument avancé par le demandeur est dénué de fondement.
[27]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est donc rejetée.
[28]
Aucune question n'a été proposée à la certification au titre de l'article 74 de la LIPR et la présente décision n'en soulève aucune, car elle est liée aux faits de la présente affaire.
JUGEMENT
[29]
LA COUR STATUE que
1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
2. aucune question de portée générale n'est certifiée;
