MacKay, J.
: This is an application on behalf of the defendant, Her Majesty the Queen, for an order dismissing or striking out the plaintiffs' statement of claim in whole or in part as against the defendant. The application is made pursuant to Federal Court Rules 341 and 419(1)(b), (c) and (f), on the grounds that
(a) the plaintiffs have already been compensated for the damages claimed in this action by moneys paid by the Government of Canada out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund; and
(b) certain of the plaintiffs, Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and H. & L. Langille Enterprises, were adjudged bankrupt by Receiving Order dated October 3, 1983, and the trustee elected not to continue this action, previously initiated, against the Crown.
Background
[2]
In this matter the plaintiffs' statement of claim was filed March 26, 1980, and served May 1, 1980, and a statement of defence was filed May 28, 1980, and served the following day. Lists of documents and revised or supplementary lists of documents were filed in that same year and discovery examination of the plaintiffs' and of the defendant's witnesses took place in the first three months of 1981. Thereafter, in June and July of 1981 notices were served upon the plaintiffs to admit documents and to admit facts. No further activity appears from the record of the action until November 2, 1987, when a Notice of Change of Solicitor, for the plaintiffs, was filed. The plaintiffs then gave Notice of Intention to Proceed, dated September 1989. In December 1989 a pretrial conference was conducted by Martin, J., and pursuant to leave then granted, with consent of counsel for the plaintiffs, the defendant filed an Amended Statement of Defence in January 1990. On February 1, 1990, counsel for the plaintiffs filed a reply to the 1981 Notice to Admit Facts, whereby the plaintiffs do not admit any of the facts included in the defendant's Notice. On November 15, 1990, the defendant's motion, which is the subject matter of these reasons, was filed and it was heard at Halifax, December 11, 1990.
[3]
This action arises from circumstances surrounding destruction of dairy cattle owned by the plaintiffs, ordered and effected by officers of the defendant in the Canada Department of Agriculture, in 1978, for purposes of control of brucellosis, pursuant to the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-13, as amended (now R.S.C. 1985, c. A-11), and subsequent actions or omissions alleged to have been committed by officers of the department.
[4]
In 1978 the individual plaintiffs were dairy farmers operating under the name and style of Langille Farms, a partnership which is one of the plaintiffs in this action. Herbert Langille and Leon Langille also operated dairy farming business as a partnership under the name and style H. & L. Langille Enterprises, another partnership which is also one of the plaintiffs in this action. The plaintiffs were owners of lands and premises located near Brooklyn, Annapolis County, in Nova Scotia, known as the Langille's farm. Eric Langille and Paul Langille were also owners of lands and premises known as the Phinney farm, also located near Brooklyn, about 1.5 miles from the Langille's farm. The two farms were apparently operated in conjunction with one another.
[5]
As a result of suspected brucellosis among cattle owned by the plaintiffs in December 1977, the Langille farm was subject to quarantine and, after further tests, all dairy cattle, over 600 cows, owned by them and located on the two farms were ordered to be destroyed pursuant to s. 11(1) of the
Act
which provides:
"11(1) The Minister or a person appointed by him for the purpose may cause an animal to be destroyed if
(a) it is affected with or suffering from or suspected of being affected with or suffering from infectious or contagious disease,
(b) it is or has been in contact with or in close proximity to an animal then affected with or suffering from or suspected of then being affected with or suffering from infectious or contagious disease, or
(c) it is or has been in contact with or in close proximity to animal products or animal by-products, hay, straw, fodder, feed stuffs, fertilizer, manure, packing material, containers or other things then affected with or suspected of then being affected with infectious or contagious disease."
[6]
In connection with destruction of the cattle the Minister of Agriculture ordered compensation to be paid to the plaintiffs Herbert, Leon, Eric and Paul Langille in accord with s. 12(1) of the
Act
. Under s. 12(2), compensation payable for cattle destroyed shall be the market value, in the opinion of the Minister or a person appointed by him, that the animals destroyed would have had immediately before destruction if they had not been subject to destruction under the
Act
, except that compensation shall not exceed a maximum amount prescribed by the Governor-in-Council for purebred and grade animals (at the relevant time, $900 and $500 respectively), minus an amount equal to the value of the carcasses as determined by the Minister.
[7]
The Minister appointed persons pursuant to s. 12(2) to determine the valuation of the cattle that were ultimately destroyed. The individual plaintiffs were not satisfied with this valuation, whereupon other persons were appointed to conduct another valuation of the cattle and this determination was completed.
[8]
Under the
Act
provision is made for an appeal, in accord with Part II of the
Pesticide Residue Compensation Act
, then R.S.C. 1970, c. P-11, as amended (now R.S.C. 1985, c. P-10), by the owner of an animal ordered destroyed. Under the latter
Act
an appeal may be brought to the assessor, within three months of receipt of notice of the decision or the compensation or such longer period as the assessor may allow, on the ground that compensation awarded was unreasonable where either no compensation is awarded or the compensation awarded is less than the maximum prescribed. At no time after the determination of valuation of the cattle destroyed have the individual or other plaintiffs brought an appeal with respect to the reasonableness of the amount of compensation determined and awarded to them under the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
.
[9]
In accord with the order of the Minister for payment of compensation and the determination of valuation a total amount of $149,491.60 was paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund pursuant to
Appropriation Act No. 2
, 1978-79, S.C. 1977-78, c. 31, Schedule 1, Vote 35 as compensation to the individual plaintiffs as follows:
(a) by delivery to Herbert and Leon Langille of two cheques totalling the amount of $89,951.48 payable to Langille Farms, and
(b) by mail, of a cheque in the amount of $65,540.12, made payable to Eric and Paul Langille and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, to that Bank's branch at Kingston, N.S., in accord with an agreement between Eric Langille and the bank.
The total payments made by these cheques were in accord with the valuation determined for the animals destroyed, less the amount paid by the commercial slaughterer for the carcasses, and the payments apparently included compensation for animals that died after the valuation and prior to slaughter. These cheques are believed to have been negotiated by the payees, according to the affidavit of Dr. V. Ivan Reed, then Associate Director, Disease Control, Contagious Diseases Division of the Canada Department of Agriculture. Receipt of the cheques as payment of compensation was acknowledged in the discovery examinations of Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and Eric Langille.
[10]
Subsequently, by receiving order issued October 3, 1983, under the
Bankruptcy Act
, then R.S.C. 1970, c. B-3, as amended (now R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3) Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and H. & L. Langille Enterprises were adjudged bankrupt and their assets vested in a trustee in accord with that
Act
. Herbert and Leon Langille were discharged from bankruptcy on December 22, 1987. The former trustee, upon whom notice of the defendant's motion was served, affirms by affidavit, filed November 16, 1990, that he elected not to continue this legal action, and that no creditor elected to assume the legal action in its own name. While the trustee was discharged as trustee on January 28, 1988, it is affirmed that the trustee's position is that Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and H. & L. Enterprises have no right to continue this action in their own names.
The Issues
[11]
In this application for dismissal of the action under rule 341 or for striking the statement of claim in whole or in part under rule 419(1)(b), (c) and (f) the defendant submits
(a) that, as the plaintiffs have already been compensated for damages claimed in this action by moneys paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, those claims are barred by the
Crown Liability Act
, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-38, s. 4(1) as amended (now R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50, s. 9), which provides:
"9. No proceedings lie against the Crown or a servant of the Crown in respect of a claim if a pension or compensation has been paid or is payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or out of any funds administered by an agency of the Crown in respect of the death, injury, damage or loss in respect of which the claim is made."
(b) that those plaintiffs adjudged bankrupt, i.e., Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and H. & L. Langille Enterprises, have no right to proceed with this action, such rights as they once had having vested in their trustee in bankruptcy in accord with the
Bankruptcy Act
, and the trustee having elected not to proceed with this action, as affirmed by affidavit of the former trustee.
The plaintiffs argue against the motion, principally in relation to the ground raised in relation to the
Crown Liability Act
. On their behalf little was urged at the hearing in regard to the second ground, the bankruptcy of certain of the plaintiffs, even though this matter was previously raised in the course of the pretrial conference conducted by my colleague Martin, J., in December 1989.
The Plaintiffs' Claims And The
Crown Liability Act, s. 9
[12]
Insofar as the plaintiffs' claims are in relation to loss or damage arising from destruction of cattle undertaken in accord with the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
, they are clearly barred in this case by s. 9 (formerly s. 4(1)) of the
Crown Liability Act
. Compensation has been paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in respect of that loss or damage and no proceedings lie against the Crown in relation to that loss.
[13]
I do not accept the submission of counsel for the plaintiffs that action is not precluded against the Crown where the compensation paid is only partial in the sense that the actual loss may exceed the amount paid or payable under the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
and
Regulations
. Section 9 of the
Crown Liability Act
, banning proceedings against the Crown "in respect of a claim if ... compensation has been paid ... in respect of the ... damage or loss in respect of which the claim is made", in my view, clearly precludes any claim which relates merely to the amount of compensation. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A-102-80 (F.C.A.)). As earlier noted, a question about the quantum of compensation could have been raised in accordance with the process provided under s. 14 of the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
and Part II of the
Pesticide Residue Compensation Act
; it cannot be raised by an action against the Crown.
[14]
Yet here the nature of the plaintiffs' claims is said not to relate merely to the question of compensation for cattle destroyed. Counsel submits that the claims, so far as they concern loss from destruction of the cattle, are based on the plaintiffs' contention that the necessary basis for action under the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
, i.e., the existence of evidence of brucellosis, was not here established so that the action taken was not properly within the discretion of the Minister or his delegate under s. 11 of the
Act
. Even though that discretion is described in very broad terms and proving that discretion exercised was unlawful may be difficult, it seems to me that issue is not precluded by s. 9 of the
Crown Liability Act
. The defendant cannot avoid liability for tort, if such is established, under s. 3(a) of the same
Act
merely because compensation has been paid as if the acts of her officers had been lawful and in accord with the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
. Where the claim is that their actions are not so authorized, and loss is caused, the claim is simply a claim in tort. Proceedings to establish that claim are not barred by s. 9 of the
Crown Liability Act
and the limitations on compensation provided under the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
and
Regulations
may not be applicable to a damage award for the loss, if wrongdoing on the part of the Crown's officers is established.
[15]
The statement of claim in the action alleges several grounds for the damages claimed. These include alleged negligence on the part of the defendant's officers, which caused loss to the plaintiffs (paragraph 8), by, inter alia, ordering destruction of the cattle without any or sufficient cause, and despite the clear lack of evidence to indicate a brucellosis infection. The plaintiffs claim general damages (paragraph 16), for (i) loss of income, (ii) loss of cattle, (iii) loss of offspring of cattle, all of which may be substantially related to the destruction of the cattle, here claimed by the plaintiffs to have been unlawful.
[16]
The plaintiffs also claim general damages for (iv) loss of "R.O.P. records" (i.e., records maintained in the Canadian Record of Performance Program of the Department of Agriculture), for (v) loss of Nova Scotia Crop & Livestock Insurance proceeds, and for (vi) loss of Holstein Friesian Association Membership, all of which latter claims are alleged to arise by reason of action or inaction, wrongful, by officers of the defendant subsequent to destruction of the cattle which had a bearing on the plaintiffs' efforts to restock their dairy operation. The
Crown Liability Act
, s. 9, does not preclude proceedings against the Crown where claims relate to losses allegedly arising from tortious activity, including negligence, of the Crown's officers after destruction of the cattle.
[17]
While the defendant denies, in its amended statement of defence, any alleged acts of negligence or wrongdoing by officers of the Crown, the issues thus raised by allegation and denial will only be resolved by evidence at trial. At this stage it would be wrong to deny the plaintiffs the opportunity to adduce evidence of wrongdoing by dismissing the action or striking portions of the statement of claim because of s. 9 of the
Crown Liability Act
, even though that provision will preclude evidence and argument at trial relating solely to the reasonableness of compensation paid to the plaintiffs, assuming their cattle were destroyed within the authority granted under the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
.
Standing Of Certain Of The Plaintiffs
To Claim Following Bankruptcy
[18]
Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and H. & L. Langille Enterprises having been adjudged bankrupt by receiving order dated October 3, 1983, lost their rights to pursue this action by virtue of the receiving order, in accord with the
Bankruptcy Act
, supra, s. 50(5), (now s. 71(2) of the
Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3). That provision is as follows:
"71(2) On a receiving order being made or an assignment being filed with an official receiver, a bankrupt ceases to have any capacity to dispose of or otherwise deal with his property, which shall, subject to this Act and to the rights of secured creditors, forthwith pass to and vest in the trustee named in the receiving order or assignment, and in any case of change of trustee the property shall pass from trustee to trustee without any conveyance, assignment or transfer."
[19]
There is no doubt that the rights of these plaintiffs in this action are property as
choses
or things in action, within s. 2 of the
Bankruptcy Act
, which defines "property" in the following words:
"'property' includes money, goods, things in action, land, and every description of property, whether real or personal, movable or immovable, legal or equitable, and whether situated in Canada or elsewhere and includes obligations, easements, and every description of estate, interest and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, in, arising out of, or incident to property."
[20]
Under s. 67 (formerly s. 47) of the
Act
the property of a bankrupt divisible among his creditors comprises all property wherever situated of the bankrupt at the date of his bankruptcy and such powers in or over or in respect of the property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit, except for property held by the bankrupt in trust for another person and property exempt from execution or seizure under provincial laws.
[21]
Counsel for the defendant referred to a number of cases where an undischarged bankrupt was held not to have standing to commence action in relation to his property on the ground that it was then vested in the trustee. (See, e.g.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), (where Dubé, J., declined to strike a counterclaim initiated by owners of a vessel who subsequently made an assignment in bankruptcy, where the trustee of the bankrupt's estate had already been given leave to intervene in the matter). The lack of standing to sue by an undischarged bankrupt extends to a situation where the bankrupt has purchased property from the trustee following bankruptcy:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.).
[22]
Does the discharge of the bankrupt change this situation? Discharge of the bankrupt does relieve him or her of obligations or claims provable in bankruptcy except for certain specified exceptions, under s. 178 (formerly s. 148) of the
Act
. But it does not again vest the property of the bankrupt, not disposed of by his estate's trustee, in the bankrupt:
Re Lifshen
(1977), 25 C.B.R.(N.S.) 12 (Sask. Q.B.).
[23]
The
Act
does provide for return of certain property to the bankrupt under s. 40(1) (formerly s. 22(1)), as follows:
"40(1) With the permission of the inspectors, any property of a bankrupt found incapable of realization shall be returned to the bankrupt prior to the trustee's application for discharge."
There is no evidence before the court that such a step was taken by the trustee in this case, though the obligation to do so appears clear, before the trustee's discharge. All that is before the court is the averments of the former trustee that he elected not to continue this action against the Crown and that no creditor elected to assume this legal action in its own name. The plaintiffs Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and H. & L. Langille Enterprises may have some claim against the trustee to recover rights to proceed with this action though, if that is the case and it is not completed before trial in this matter, the issue of standing of these plaintiffs at trial may be summarily dealt with by the trial judge on the basis of the authorities noted here.
[24]
In the meantime, pending commencement of trial, I am not disposed to strike Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and H. & L. Langille Enterprises as plaintiffs from this action. Under rule 1724 the cause of action survives and is unaffected by their bankruptcy, except that another, their trustee, stands in their place as plaintiffs at least so long as the trustee holds their property for the benefit of creditors. Moreover, the action continues in the name of other plaintiffs and retaining the names as plaintiffs of those formerly bankrupt until trial of this matter, if trial there is to be, does not complicate matters for any of the parties particularly since all plaintiffs are represented by the same counsel.
Conclusion
[25]
In the result, the defendant's motion is dismissed at this stage in these proceedings. Nevertheless, it has served to clarify some issues and in my view, the plaintiffs are clearly on notice that a claim to loss arising from destruction of their cattle ordered within the discretion vested in the Minister or his delegate under the
Animal Disease and Protection Act
is banned by s. 9 of the
Crown Liability Act
, compensation for the loss having been paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The plaintiffs who were formerly bankrupt, i.e., Herbert Langille, Leon Langille and H. & L. Langille Enterprises may not continue at trial as plaintiffs unless the trial judge then finds that their rights to continue, vested in their trustee by reasons of their bankruptcy, have again been vested in them.
[26]
Costs of this motion were sought by the applicant/defendant and resisted by the respondents/plaintiffs. In the circumstances, and in light of the result, it seems to me appropriate that costs be in the cause.
Order accordingly.
