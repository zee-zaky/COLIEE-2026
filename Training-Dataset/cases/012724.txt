[1]
Noël, J.
: Jun Tao Bi [the Applicant], a permanent resident, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD or panel] dated June 27, 2011. The IAD rejected the Applicant's appeal of a determination that he had failed to comply with the residency obligation of section 28 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA].
I.
Background
[2]
The Applicant is a Chinese citizen who became a permanent resident of Canada on September 3, 2005, along with his parents and sister. He returned to China approximately one month later.
[3]
Upon his return to China, the Applicant remained unemployed from October 2005 to February 21, 2007, when he entered into an agreement with a Canadian business to work as an assistant general manager in China until January 20, 2010.
[4]
In an application for a travel document dated April 3, 2010, the Applicant indicated that he had spent 130 days in Canada over the previous four-and-a-half years. The visa office refused his application for a travel document based on a lack of supporting evidence and, moreover, determined he had also failed to satisfy his residency obligation. The Applicant appealed this decision to the IAD and a hearing was held in Vancouver on April 18, 2011.
II.
Impugned Decision
[5]
The IAD observed that section 28 of the IRPA provides for a number of ways to meet the residency obligation requirements, but the determining factor in this case was whether the Applicant had met the required time spent working full-time for a Canadian business outside Canada, as prescribed by subsection 61(3) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR] :
Employment outside Canada
(3) For the purposes of subparagraphs 28(2)(a)(iii) and (iv) of the Act, the expression "employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or in the public service of Canada or of a province" means, in relation to a permanent resident, that the permanent resident is an employee of, or under contract to provide services to, a Canadian business or the public service of Canada or of a province, and is assigned on a full-time basis as a term of the employment or contract to
(a) a position outside Canada;
(b) an affiliated enterprise outside Canada; or
(c) a client of the Canadian business or the public service outside Canada.
Travail hors du Canada
(3) Pour l'application des sous-alinéas 28(2)a)(iii) et (iv) de la Loi respectivement, les expressions « travaille, hors du Canada, à temps plein pour une entreprise canadienne ou pour l'administration publique fédérale ou provinciale » et « travaille à temps plein pour une entreprise canadienne ou pour l'administration publique fédérale ou provinciale », à l'égard d'un résident permanent, signifient qu'il est l'employé ou le fournisseur de services à contrat d'une entreprise canadienne ou de l'administration publique, fédérale ou provinciale, et est affecté à temps plein, au titre de son emploi ou du contrat de fourniture:
a) soit à un poste à l'extérieur du Canada;
b) soit à une entreprise affiliée se trouvant à l'extérieur du Canada;
c) soit à un client de l'entreprise canadienne ou de l'administration publique se trouvant à l'extérieur du Canada.
[6]
The IAD then referred to this Court's recent decision in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ 560 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], where it considered the same provision:
[42] [...] More importantly for the case in issue, subsection 61(3) specifically refers to subparagraph 28(2)(a)(iii) and offers a more precise definition of what working outside Canada means in relation to a permanent resident. On reading subsection 61(3) of the Regulations, which describes the concept of working outside Canada, the Court notes that the permanent resident must be employed but that Parliament added the concept of an assignment, which is absent from subparagraph 28(2)(a)(iii) of the Act.
[...]
[52] [...] The word assignment in the context of permanent resident status interpreted in light of the Act and Regulations necessarily implies a connecting factor to the employer located in Canada. The word "assigned" in subsection 61(3) of the Regulations means that an individual who is assigned to a position outside Canada on a temporary basis and who maintains a connection to a Canadian business or to the public service of Canada or of a province, may therefore return to Canada. [...]
[7]
Turning to the facts before it, the IAD remarked that the Applicant had provided an undated employment letter and that while he testified as to the nature of the work he did for his employer, there were some discrepancies in the evidence relating to the description of his work. The IAD found no evidence that the Applicant worked for his employer in Canada prior to working in China and noted that when questioned about work in Canada, it said the Applicant "testified that he would submit his information in Canada" (Trial Record [TR] at 4, IAD Reasons at para 7).
[8]
The IAD concluded that the Applicant did not appear to have been assigned to a position outside Canada on a temporary basis, nor was there evidence of any expectation that the Applicant would return to work for the company in Canada. It also noted that the Applicant testified he was not aware of any other employees of the company in China and never met any employees of the company in Canada. Based on the evidence before it, the IAD dismissed the appeal, concluding that the Applicant had not met his burden of establishing that his employment circumstances fit within the requirements set out in subsection 61(3) of the IRPR.
III.
Parties' Positions
[9]
The Applicant argues that the IAD erred in finding there was insufficient credible evidence that his employment circumstances met the requirements of subsection 61(3) of the IRPR. The Applicant also asserts that the IAD erred by not adjourning the hearing once it became clear his counsel was incompetent (the facts surrounding this allegation will be set out in the corresponding section of the analysis below).
[10]
The Respondent takes the position that the IAD properly considered and applied the residency requirements under subsection 61(3). It also contends the IAD committed no breach of procedural fairness as the Applicant has failed to establish that his counsel's incompetence, if any, resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
IV.
Issues
[11]
This Court will consider the following two issues:
1. Did the IAD err in its determination that the Applicant's employment outside Canada did not meet the requirements of subsection 61(3) of the IRPR?
2. Did the IAD breach its duty of procedural fairness by not adjourning the hearing?
V.
Standard of Review
[12]
The IAD's interpretation and application of subsection 61(3) of the IRPR calls for deference and the application of the standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Accordingly, this Court will determine whether there was justification, transparency, and intelligibility within the decision-making process and ensure that the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47). By contrast, issues of procedural fairness call for the standard of correctness and no deference will be shown if the IAD erred in not adjourning the hearing (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ 1493 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
VI.
Analysis
A.
Did the IAD err in its determination that the Applicant's employment outside Canada
did not meet the requirements of subsection 61(3) of the IRPR?
[13]
Subparagraph 28(2)(
a
)(iii) of the IRPA provides that a permanent resident will comply with a residency obligation with respect to every five-year period if, on each of at least 730 days in that five-year period, they are outside Canada employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business. Subsection 61(3) of the IRPR elaborates further, explaining that the permanent resident must be an employee of, or under contract to provide services to, a Canadian business, and must be assigned on a full-time basis as a term of the employment contract to, among others, a position outside Canada.
[14]
According to the Applicant, the IAD unreasonably imported its own criteria rather than follow established principles and jurisprudence. As noted above, to interpret subsection 61(3), the IAD relied almost entirely if not completely on this Court's decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 52:
[52] [...] The word assignment in the context of permanent resident status interpreted in light of the Act and Regulations necessarily implies a connecting factor to the employer located in Canada. The word "assigned" in subsection 61(3) of the Regulations means that an individual who is assigned to a position outside Canada on a temporary basis and who maintains a connection to a Canadian business [...]
may
therefore return to Canada. [...] [Emphasis added.]
The Applicant underscores this Court's use of the word 'may' above. He does so because the IAD appears to have held against him the fact he did not show evidence of any expectation he would return to work for his employer in Canada (TR at 4-5, IAD Reasons at para 7). The Applicant contends the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> does not require that the employee return to Canada, only that he "may".
[15]
I disagree with the Applicant's interpretation of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> on this point. The Court made its view clear ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 49, 52-54):
[49] [...] the record contains no documentary evidence pointing to a commitment on the part of the employer to promote [the employee], within a specified timeframe, to a position [with the employer in Canada]
following a temporary stay in China
[...]
[52] [...] The word "assigned" in subsection 61(3) of the Regulations means that an individual who is assigned to a position outside Canada
on a temporary basis and who maintains a connection to a Canadian business
, may therefore return to Canada. [...]
[53] The clarification added by Parliament to subsection 61(3) of the Regulations creates an equilibrium between the obligation imposed on the permanent resident to accumulate the required number of days under the Act while recognizing that there may be opportunities for permanent residents to work abroad.
[54] Consequently, the Court is of the opinion that, in light of the evidence in the record, the panel's finding that permanent residents holding full-time positions outside Canada with an eligible Canadian company can accumulate days that would enable them to comply with the residency obligation set out in section 28 of the Act, is unreasonable.
Clearly, the Court was opposed to an employee accumulating days towards meeting their residency requirement simply by being hired on a full-time basis outside of Canada by a Canadian business. Instead, it was this Court's view that the permanent resident must be assigned temporarily, maintain a connection with his or her employer, and to continue working for his or her employer in Canada following the assignment.
[16]
The Applicant also contends that the IAD reproached him for not having first worked for his employer in Canada prior to working abroad (Trial Record [TR] at 4-5, IAD Reasons at para 7). I would agree here that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> does not mandate that the permanent resident first worked in Canada. The emphasis is instead on the temporary nature of the assignment that requires the employee to maintain a connection with the Canadian business and to then remain employed for that business in Canada.
[17]
As for the questioning of maintaining a sufficient connection between the Applicant and his employer (the "connecting factor"), the IAD's only findings appear to be that the Applicant was not aware of any other employees of the company in China and that he never met any of the employees of the company in Canada. The Applicant argues the finding on the latter point was based on inaccurate translation. He claims that while the IAD asked him at the hearing whether he had ever met with his employer or its employees in Canada, the interpreter actually mistranslated the question and asked whether he had ever worked together with the employer or its employees while he was in Canada, to which the answer was no.
[18]
In
Jiang,
this Court determined there was no "connecting factor". The employer testified and the record showed that he had no intention to promote his employee to a position in Canada and the employee would have to re-apply for any position there. The Applicant argues that this Court should reach a different conclusion than in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> because here the Applicant was hired in Vancouver, and while his employment agreement stated he would be required to spend a significant amount of time in China, nothing in the agreement prevented him from working in Canada so long as he fulfilled his duties. He argues that, unlike in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , he would have been able to return to work in Canada for his employer without having to re-apply. He also testified at the hearing that he was waiting to return to Canada to re-negotiate his contract and that he hoped for someone else to assume the duties that required him to be in China.
[19]
The Respondent rightfully points out that while the Applicant's employment agreement may not have required him to work exclusively in China, in reality he did work there on a full-time basis and testified that he had never worked for his employer in Canada. Furthermore, while his contract was for a temporary period of time, there was no provision that he would work in Canada once his contract expired, which occurred in January of 2010 after three years of employment. While I recognize that the Applicant appears to have continued working for his employer after the contract expired and that he expressed a desire to continue the work in Canada, I find the Applicant has nevertheless failed to meet the requirements established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above.
[20]
The Applicant entered into an employment agreement with a Canadian business for a period of three years. In that time, the Applicant worked on a full-time basis in China, only returning to Canada for short periods of time "to report to the job and to stay in the country" (TR at 29, Transcript of Proceedings at line 7). Whether he had intended it or not, the Applicant was hired on a full-time basis to work outside of Canada. He now wishes to count the days he spent working in China towards his residency requirement. This is precisely the situation this Court found unreasonable in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[21]
It was this Court's view in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that to have time spent outside of Canada count toward the residency requirement, the permanent resident must be assigned temporarily, must maintain a connection with his employer, and must return to work for it in Canada following the assignment. Even if a translation error occurred during the hearing which caused a misunderstanding as to the Applicant's continued connection with his employer, there is no doubt the Applicant was not assigned to temporarily work abroad. Instead, his work abroad began from the moment he was hired and continued to the expiry of his contract nearly three years later. Furthermore, there is simply no evidence his employer had agreed to keep the Applicant on in Canada after this period. The Applicant only indicated at the hearing that he now wanted to talk to the employer to tell him or her that he wanted to work in Canada and inquire as to whether another employee could be sent abroad in his place (TR at 28, Transcript of Proceedings at lines 10-15). As a result, I find the IAD's conclusion that the Applicant did not meet his burden of establishing that he had satisfied the requirements under subsection 61(3) of the IRPR to be reasonable.
[22]
While the Applicant questioned, in his written submissions only, the adequacy of the reasons, the Supreme Court's recent decision in
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] SCJ 62, makes clear that where, as here, there are reasons given, any challenge to the reasoning or result of the officer's decision should be made within the reasonableness analysis. As stated above, I have determined the IAD's decision to be reasonable and its reasons are supported by the record.
B.
Did the IAD breach its duty of procedural fairness by not adjourning the hearing?
[23]
The Applicant argues the IAD should have adjourned the hearing once it became clear his counsel was incompetent. He alleges its failure to do so was a breach of natural justice.
[24]
Because he is still in China, the Applicant could not attend the hearing, but participated instead by telephone. An interpreter was required to translate for him between Cantonese and English. Two individuals were at the hearing to represent the Applicant: Ms. Leung was there as a volunteer from a benevolent organization while Mr. Lam was a friend of the Applicant's father, having met him through the Guangzhou Huadu Benevolent Association.
[25]
There was initially some question as to whether the appropriate representation forms had been submitted. It was determined that Ms. Leung had in fact submitted the required forms, but Mr. Lam had not. Ms. Leung requested that the hearing be adjourned as she and Mr. Lam had not understood the hearing would take place until very recently and were not prepared for it. Ms. Leung tried to explain the confusion, stating at one point (TR at 15-16, Transcript of Proceedings at lines 38-40 and 1-5):
We just want to tell you the story because this is our first time before you and we're absolutely green on the matter. And the fact is that we got a letter this weekend - only this weekend Mr. Bi just been told of it because we - the (indiscernible) we notified them a change of address. They sent it to a vacant house because he's stuck in China and the letter says something about the document hasn't been reviewed, so we kind of panicked on Sunday. We immediate wrote in here - faxed it last night at eight o'clock, which they acknowledge received this morning, that we don't know - we don't understand what's going on.
The presiding member of the IAD [member] cut Ms. Leung off at that point, indicating they would proceed with the hearing. She added that Ms. Leung should not agree to assist people if she didn't really know what was going on. The member also indicated she was prepared to take the Applicant through the usual areas that are covered and then, if necessary, Ms. Leung or Mr. Lam could ask any other questions before the Minister's counsel asked its questions. The member added that as time had been set aside for that day, there was no point in wasting taxpayers' money, and then proceeded with the hearing. None of the preceding was translated to the Applicant.
[26]
Another discussion followed to determine whether Mr. Lam would assist Ms. Leung during the hearing or whether he would testify and hence be asked to leave the room. It was eventually decided Mr. Lam would stay. Other remarks made by the member pertinent to the issue of procedural fairness and the quality of the Applicant's counsel include the following: "There's not going to be an issue about whether or not [the Applicant] is going to get a fair hearing. I'm going to take him through the issues" (TR at 18, Transcript of Proceedings at lines 31-32) and "Yes, okay, I accept that. But sir again, parties shouldn't accept taking on a role of representative if you don't follow the rules and if you don't know the rules, you should learn the rules before you act for people" (TR at 21, Transcript of Proceedings at lines 16-18). I also note that Ms. Leung asked only a few questions, none of which addressed the Applicant's employment with a Canadian business or the terms of the agreement. Indeed, Ms. Leung was clearly out of her element, as illustrated by the following exchange (TR at 41, Transcript of Proceedings at lines 13-21):
Presiding Member: Okay. Is there any other questions in reply that you'd like to ask?
Ms. Leung: The last question about did he not tell the Canadian - but I have - Exhibit 6 here -
Presiding Member: Ma'am, do you have a question? Submissions come after.
Ms. Leung: Oh, I better ask him. Oh, God, I don't - I apologize.
Ms. Leung's closing submissions similarly leave no doubt that she did not understand the proceedings, her role, or even the issues at hand (TR at 42-44, Transcript of Proceedings).
[27]
Mr. Lam was in no better position, appearing nervous (according to Ms. Leung) and having difficulty communicating in English. When the member asked whether they had a reply, Ms. Leung asked if Mr. Lam could speak in Chinese and have it translated into English. The member responded that he needed to speak in English given his role as counsel (TR at 45, Transcript of Proceedings at lines 23-27). Another exchange indicative of the situation is as follows (TR at 46-47, Transcript of Proceedings from line 14):
Presiding member: If the documents aren't true it would be illegal.
Ms. Leung: Yes.
Mr. Lam: Then of course, Mr. - I'm sorry, I could not make a comment on - I just want honourable member just consider all the fact have been given to you and - I'm sorry, madam, I lost word and I -
Ms. Leung: Calm down. Calm down for a minute and then you tell he what you want to say. Just calm down a minute. I know you want to say something.
Mr. Lam: Yeah, reconsider and give a chance to Mr. Bi submit all this document. Sure, the documents might not be 100 percent perfect fit for the department's requirement and I have - please ask the honourable madam to consider and review the documents we submit.
Presiding member: Thank you.
Mr. Lam: Thank you.
Presiding member: I'm going to reserve my decision, so the decision will be provided to the parties in a few weeks. I'll just make one comment. In future if either of you intend to assist people, either at the Immigration Appeal Division or somewhere else, you ask that organization what the rules are and follow those rules well before a hearing date and, in fact, observe a hearing, because they're usually public, so you're aware of what to do or what you can do or not do to order to better assist whoever you're attempting to assist, because you might not get as much leeway as you would in these types of circumstances. It's generally not helpful to anybody to offer assistance when you're not sure what you're doing.
[28]
To convince this Court that the IAD erred in not adjourning the hearing, the Applicant must establish that his counsel's acts or omissions constituted incompetence resulting in a miscarriage of justice (
R v GDB
, 2000 SCC 22 at para 26, [2000] 1 SCR 520 [
GDB
]). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, this Court applied the test in
GDB
, confirming that the right to effective counsel has been recognized in the refugee context and that subsection 167(1) of the IRPA provides persons who are the subject of Immigration and Refugee Board proceedings a statutory right to be represented by counsel. The Court also offered the following caution ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 36):
[36] However, in proceedings under the IRPA, the incompetence of counsel will only constitute a breach of natural justice in "extraordinary circumstances" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 15 (T.D.)). With respect to the performance component, at a minimum, "the incompetence or negligence of the applicant's representative [must be] sufficiently specific and clearly supported by the evidence" (
Shirwa
, above, at 60). With respect to the prejudice component,
the Court must be satisfied that a miscarriage of justice resulted
. Consistent with the extraordinary nature of this ground of challenge, the performance component must be exceptional and the miscarriage of justice component must be manifested in procedural unfairness, the reliability of the trial result having been compromised, or another readily apparent form. [Emphasis added.]
[29]
There is no doubt Ms. Leung and Mr. Lam were unqualified to act as the Applicant's counsel. Neither appeared to have any legal training or even a rudimentary understanding of the proceedings. This also quickly became evident to the member, who indicated that while she would proceed with the hearing, she was prepared to take the Applicant through the usual issues covered. The member remarked at one point: "There's not going to be an issue about whether or not [the Applicant] is going to get a fair hearing. I'm going to take him through the issues" (TR at 18, Transcript of Proceedings at lines 31-32).
[30]
The Applicant notes that the IAD's decision was based in part on alleged discrepancies and omissions contained within his testimony. He argues that while this would usually constitute an acceptable reason to conclude he had not met his onus of proving his case, in this case the member chose to conduct the examination-in-chief. Hence she had the ability to ask him any questions that would have addressed her concerns and by failing to do so and basing her decision on his failure to adequately address the issues, she breached her duty of procedural fairness. This was further compounded by her failure to adjourn the hearing when initially asked to do so.
[31]
The Respondent is of the view that the Applicant has failed to show his counsel's incompetence resulted in a miscarriage of justice and has not shown a reasonable probability that, but for this incompetence, the IAD would have reached a different conclusion or that it rendered the hearing process unfair.
[32]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2005] FCJ 1672, my colleague Justice Harrington observed that, "[t] here is a great deal of jurisprudence in these matters to the effect that a party must suffer the consequences of his or her own counsel. I subscribe to that view. If a case has been poorly prepared; if relevant jurisprudence was not brought to the attention of the Court in a civil case; if there was a bad choice in witness selection, the consequences fall on that party." I am of the view that the facts in the case at bar are analogous to the examples listed by Justice Harrington. The Applicant simply chose untrained and unqualified representatives from which more could not have been expected and he must unfortunately suffer the consequences. The Applicant did have a lawyer at a certain time. A request for an extension of time was sought because of the withdrawal of his counsel and for the time required to find another lawyer (see TR at page 218).
[33]
In
R v Dunbar
, 2003 BCCA 667 at para 26, [2003] BCJ 2767, the Court of Appeal of British Columbia considered the prejudice component as follows:
[26] The prejudice component requires the appellant to show that the incompetence of trial counsel resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Doherty J.A. discussed the meaning of "miscarriage of justice" in this context in
Joanisse
, supra at 64. He explained that a miscarriage of justice can result where the appellant establishes a reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. A reasonable probability is one that is "sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome" and "lies somewhere between a mere possibility and a likelihood":
Joanisse
,
supra
at 62;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.C.C. (3d) 303 at 319. Alternatively, a reliable outcome may still constitute a miscarriage of justice where the process through which that verdict was reached was unfair:
Joanisse
,
supra
at 62;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Applicant has failed to show a reasonable probability that were it not for his counsel, the result of the proceedings would have been different. In answering the questions posed to him, the Applicant simply failed to provide clear and satisfactory answers that would have established he met the requirements under subsection 61(3) of the IRPR. The IAD's conclusion is not a result of it having asked insufficient questions during the hearing, as alleged by the Applicant, but rather a reflection of the Applicant's answers and the evidence brought forth. Accordingly, I find there was no breach of procedural fairness in this case and the IAD's decision was reasonable.
[34]
Counsel did not submit questions for certification.
JUDGMENT
[35]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed and no question will be certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Bi [le demandeur], qui est résident permanent, sollicite le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision datée du 27 juin 2011 de la Section d'appel de l'immigration [la SAI ou le tribunal]. La SAI a rejeté l'appel du demandeur à l'égard d'une décision portant qu'il ne s'était pas conformé à l'obligation de résidence que prévoit l'article 28 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR].
I.
Le contexte
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen de la Chine qui a acquis le statut de résident permanent du Canada le 3 septembre 2005, de pair avec ses parents et sa sœur. Il est retourné dans son pays environ un mois plus tard.
[3]
De retour en Chine, le demandeur est resté sans travail entre le mois d'octobre 2005 et le 21 février 2007, date à laquelle il a conclu un contrat avec une entreprise canadienne pour travailler comme directeur général adjoint dans ce pays jusqu'au 20 janvier 2010.
[4]
Dans une demande de document de voyage datée du 3 avril 2010, le demandeur a dit avoir passé 130 jours au Canada au cours des quatre dernières années et demie. Le bureau des visas a refusé la demande à cause d'un manque de preuves à l'appui et, par ailleurs, il a conclu que le demandeur ne s'était pas non plus conformé à son obligation de résidence. Ce dernier a interjeté appel de cette décision auprès de la SAI, et une audience a été tenue à Vancouver le 18 avril 2011.
II.
La décision contestée
[5]
La SAI a fait remarquer que l'article 28 de la LIPR prévoit un certain nombre de façons de répondre aux exigences liées à l'obligation de résidence mais que, dans le cas du demandeur, le facteur déterminant consistait à savoir s'il avait passé le temps requis à travailler, hors du Canada, à temps plein pour une entreprise canadienne, ainsi que le prescrit le paragraphe 61(3) du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 (le RIPR):
Travail hors du Canada
(3) Pour l'application des sous-alinéas 28(2)
a
)(iii) et (iv) de la Loi respectivement, les expressions « travaille, hors du Canada, à temps plein pour une entreprise canadienne ou pour l'administration publique fédérale ou provinciale » et « travaille à temps plein pour une entreprise canadienne ou pour l'administration publique fédérale ou provinciale », à l'égard d'un résident permanent, signifient qu'il est l'employé ou le fournisseur de services à contrat d'une entreprise canadienne ou de l'administration publique, fédérale ou provinciale, et est affecté à temps plein, au titre de son emploi ou du contrat de fourniture:
a
) soit à un poste à l'extérieur du Canada;
b) soit à une entreprise affiliée se trouvant à l'extérieur du Canada;
c) soit à un client de l'entreprise canadienne ou de l'administration publique se trouvant à l'extérieur du Canada.
Employment outside Canada
(3) For the purposes of subparagraphs 28(2)(a)(iii) and (iv) of the Act, the expression "employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business or in the public service of Canada or of a province" means, in relation to a permanent resident, that the permanent resident is an employee of, or under contract to provide services to, a Canadian business or the public service of Canada or of a province, and is assigned on a full-time basis as a term of the employment or contract to
(a) a position outside Canada;
(b) an affiliated enterprise outside Canada; or
(c) a client of the Canadian business or the public service outside Canada.
[6]
La SAI s'est ensuite reportée à une décision récente de la présente Cour:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 52, [2011] ACF 560 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], où la même disposition a été prise en considération:
[42] [...] De façon plus importante pour le cas sous étude, le paragraphe 61(3) fait référence notamment au sous-alinéa 28(2)
a
)(iii) et définit plus précisément ce que signifie la notion de travail hors du Canada à l'égard d'un résident permanent. À la lecture du paragraphe 61(3) du Règlement qui explicite la notion de travail hors du Canada, la Cour note que le résident permanent doit être employé mais le législateur a ajouté la notion d'affectation, absente du sous-alinéa 28(2)
a
)(iii) de la Loi.
[...]
[52] [...] Le mot « affecté » au paragraphe 61(3) du Règlement signifie qu'un individu, qui occupe un poste à l'extérieur du Canada de façon temporaire et garde un lien de rattachement avec une entreprise canadienne ou avec l'administration publique fédérale ou provinciale, est donc susceptible de revenir au Canada.

Revenant aux faits dont elle était saisie, la SAI a fait remarquer que le demandeur avait produit une lettre d'embauche non datée et que, malgré son témoignage à propos de la nature du travail qu'il faisait pour son employeur, les éléments de preuve concernant la description de ce travail comportaient quelques divergences. La SAI n'a trouvé aucune preuve que le demandeur avait été au service de son employeur au Canada avant de travailler en Chine et elle a signalé que, à la suite d'une question sur le travail au Canada, le demandeur avait [traduction] « déclaré qu'il présenterait ses renseignements au Canada » (Dossier de première instance [DPI], page 4, Motifs de la SAI, paragraphe 7).
[8]
La SAI a conclu que le demandeur ne paraissait pas avoir été affecté à un poste à l'extérieur du Canada à titre temporaire, pas plus qu'il n'y avait une preuve d'une attente quelconque qu'il reviendrait travailler pour l'entreprise au Canada. Elle a ajouté que le demandeur avait dit ne pas être au courant de la présence d'autres employés de l'entreprise en Chine et qu'il n'avait jamais rencontré d'employés de l'entreprise au Canada. Au vu des éléments de preuve soumis, la SAI a rejeté l'appel, concluant que le demandeur ne s'était pas acquitté du fardeau d'établir que sa situation d'emploi correspondait aux exigences prescrites au paragraphe 61(3) de la LIPR.
III.
Les positions des parties
[9]
Le demandeur soutient que la SAI a commis une erreur en concluant qu'il n'y avait pas assez d'éléments dignes de foi démontrant que sa situation d'emploi répondait aux exigences du paragraphe 61(3) du RIPR. Il affirme en outre que la SAI a commis une erreur en n'ajournant pas l'audience après qu'il est devenu évident que son avocate était incompétente (les faits entourant cette allégation sont exposés dans la section correspondante de l'analyse qui suit).
[10]
Le défendeur est d'avis que la SAI a examiné et appliqué convenablement les exigences en matière de résidence que prescrit le paragraphe 61(3). Il soutient également que la SAI n'a commis aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale car le demandeur n'a pas établi que l'incompétence de son avocate, si tel était le cas, avait causé une erreur de justice.
IV.
Les questions en litige
[11]
La Cour examinera les deux questions suivantes:
1. La SAI a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le travail fait par le demandeur hors du Canada ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences du paragraphe 61(3) de la LIPR?
2. La SAI a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en n'ajournant pas l'audience?
V.
La norme de contrôle applicable
[12]
L'interprétation et l'application que fait la SAI du paragraphe 61(3) de la LIPR incitent à faire preuve de déférence et à appliquer la norme de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). En conséquence, la Cour déterminera si le processus décisionnel a été justifié, transparent et intelligible et veillera à ce que la décision rendue appartienne aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47). En revanche, les questions d'équité procédurale sont soumises à la norme de la décision correcte et il n'y aura pas lieu de faire preuve de déférence si la SAI a commis une erreur en n'ajournant pas l'audience (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] ACF 1493 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
VI.
Analyse
A.
La SAI a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le travail fait par le demandeur hors du Canada ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences du paragraphe 61(3) de la LIPR?
[13]
Aux termes du sous-alinéa 28(2)
a
)(iii) de la LIPR, le résident permanent se conforme à l'obligation de résidence à l'égard d'une période quinquennale si, pour au moins 730 jours durant cette période, il travaille, hors du Canada, à temps plein pour une entreprise canadienne. Le paragraphe 61(3) du RIPR explique de manière plus précise que le résident permanent est l'employé ou le fournisseur de services à contrat d'une entreprise canadienne et qu'il est affecté à temps plein, au titre de son emploi ou du contrat de fourniture à, notamment, un poste à l'extérieur du Canada.
[14]
Selon le demandeur, la SAI a importé déraisonnablement ses propres critères plutôt que de suivre les principes établis et la jurisprudence. Comme il a été mentionné plus tôt, pour interpréter le paragraphe 61(3) la SAI s'est fondée presque entièrement, sinon totalement, sur la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, de la Cour, au paragraphe 52:
[52] [...] Le mot affectation dans le contexte du statut de résident permanent interprété à la lumière de la Loi et du Règlement implique nécessairement un facteur de rattachement avec l'employeur situé au Canada. Le mot « affecté » au paragraphe 61(3) du Règlement signifie qu'un individu, qui occupe un poste à l'extérieur du Canada de façon temporaire et garde un lien de rattachement avec une entreprise canadienne [...] est donc
susceptible
de revenir au Canada. [...] [Non souligné dans l'original.]
Le demandeur souligne l'emploi que fait la Cour du mot « susceptible »ci-dessus, car la SAI semble avoir retenu contre lui le fait de ne pas avoir démontré l'existence d'une attente quelconque qu'il reviendrait travailler pour son employeur au Canada (DPI, pages 4 et 5, Motifs de la SAI, paragraphe 7). Le demandeur soutient que, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour n'exige pas que l'employé revienne au Canada, juste qu'il soit« susceptible » de le faire.
[15]
Je ne souscris pas à l'interprétation que fait le demandeur de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> sur ce point. La Cour a exprimé clairement son point de vue ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, aux paragraphes 49 et 52 à 54):
[49] [...] le dossier ne contient aucune preuve documentaire confirmant un engagement ferme dans le temps de la part de l'employeur qui permettrait de conclure que [l'employée] réintègrerait un poste [auprès de l'employeur]
à la suite d'une période temporaire passée en Chine
[...].
[...]
[52] [...] Le mot « affecté » au paragraphe 61(3) du Règlement signifie qu'un individu, qui occupe un poste à l'extérieur du Canada
de façon temporaire et garde un lien de rattachement avec une entreprise canadienne
ou avec l'administration publique fédérale ou provinciale, est donc susceptible de revenir au Canada. [...]
[53] La précision ajoutée par le législateur au paragraphe 61(3) du Règlement crée un équilibre entre l'obligation imposée au résident permanent de cumuler le nombre de jours requis en vertu de la Loi tout en reconnaissant les occasions qui peuvent s'offrir aux résidents permanents d'aller travailler à l'étranger.
[54] Par conséquent, la Cour est d'avis que, compte tenu de la preuve au dossier, la conclusion du Tribunal à l'effet que tout résident permanent qui occupe à temps plein un poste à l'extérieur du Canada pour une entreprise canadienne éligible peut cumuler des jours permettant de s'acquitter de l'obligation de résidence énoncée à l'article 28 de la Loi, est déraisonnable.
À l'évidence, la Cour s'est opposée à ce qu'un employé cumule des jours en vue de satisfaire à l'obligation de résidence en étant simplement embauché à temps plein à l'extérieur du Canada par une entreprise canadienne. Elle a plutôt exprimé l'avis que le résident permanent doit obtenir une affectation temporaire, garder un lien de rattachement avec son employeur et, après l'affectation, continuer de travailler pour ce dernier au Canada.
[16]
Le demandeur soutient également que la SAI lui a reproché de ne pas avoir travaillé d'abord pour son employeur au Canada avant de le faire à l'étranger (DPI, pages 4 et 5, Motifs de la SAI, paragraphe 7). Je conviens ici que la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne prescrit pas que le résident permanent doit avoir d'abord travaillé au Canada. L'accent est plutôt mis sur la nature temporaire de l'affectation, qui exige que l'employé garde un lien de rattachement avec l'entreprise canadienne et continue ensuite de travailler pour cette dernière au Canada.
[17]
Quant à la question d'un lien de rattachement suffisant entre le demandeur et son employeur (le « facteur de rattachement »), les seules conclusions de la SAI semblent être que le demandeur n'était au courant de la présence d'aucun employé de l'entreprise en Chine et qu'il n'avait jamais rencontré d'employés de l'entreprise au Canada. Le demandeur soutient que la conclusion tirée sur ce dernier point est fondée sur une interprétation inexacte. Il prétend que la SAI lui a demandé à l'audience s'il avait jamais rencontré son employeur ou les employés de ce dernier au Canada, mais que, en fait, l'interprète a mal traduit la question et a demandé s'il avait jamais travaillé avec l'employeur ou ses employés durant son séjour au Canada, ce à quoi il avait répondu que non.
[18]
Dans
Jiang,
la Cour a conclu qu'il n'existait aucun « facteur de rattachement ». L'employeur a déclaré et il est ressorti du dossier qu'il n'avait pas l'intention de promouvoir son employé à un poste au Canada et qu'il faudrait que l'employé y présente de nouveau une demande d'emploi en vue d'obtenir un poste quelconque. Le demandeur soutient que la Cour devrait arriver à une conclusion différente de celle qui a été tirée dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> car, dans le cas présent, il a été embauché à Vancouver et que, même si son contrat d'embauche indiquait qu'il allait devoir passer un temps considérable en Chine, rien dans le contrat ne l'empêchait de travailler au Canada dans la mesure où il s'acquittait de ses fonctions. Il soutient que, contrairement aux faits présentés dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il lui aurait été possible de revenir travailler au Canada pour son employeur sans avoir à faire une nouvelle demande. Il a déclaré aussi à l'audience qu'il attendait de revenir au Canada pour renégocier son contrat et qu'il espérait qu'une autre personne allait exercer les fonctions qui l'obligeaient à vivre en Chine.
[19]
Le défendeur fait remarquer avec raison que même si le contrat d'embauche du demandeur n'exigeait peut-être pas que ce dernier travaille exclusivement en Chine, il y a bel et bien travaillé à temps plein et il a déclaré n'avoir jamais travaillé pour son employeur au Canada. Par ailleurs, même si son contrat s'appliquait à une durée temporaire, il n'était pas prévu qu'il travaillerait au Canada une fois que le contrat viendrait à expiration, ce qui est arrivé en janvier 2010, après trois années de travail. Je reconnais que le demandeur semble avoir continué de travailler pour son employeur après l'expiration du contrat et qu'il a exprimé le souhait de continuer de travailler au Canada, mais je conclus qu'il ne s'est néanmoins pas conformé aux exigences établies dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée.
[20]
Le demandeur a conclu un contrat d'embauche avec une entreprise canadienne pour une période de trois ans. Durant ce temps, il a travaillé à temps plein en Chine, et n'est revenu au Canada que pour de courtes périodes [traduction] « pour se présenter au travail et rester au pays » (DPI, page 29, Transcription des débats, ligne 7). Qu'il l'ait voulu ou non, le demandeur a été embauché à temps plein pour travailler à l'extérieur du Canada. Il souhaite maintenant prendre en compte les jours qu'il a passés à travailler en Chine en vue de se conformer à son obligation de résidence. Il s'agit précisément de la situation que la Cour a trouvée déraisonnable dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[21]
Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour a exprimé l'avis que pour pouvoir prendre en compte le temps passé à l'extérieur du Canada en vue de satisfaire à l'obligation de résidence, il faut que le résident permanent soit affecté de façon temporaire, qu'il garde un lien de rattachement avec son employeur et que, après l'affectation, il revienne travailler pour ce dernier au Canada. Même s'il y a eu, à l'audience, une erreur d'interprétation qui a causé une méprise à propos du rattachement continu du demandeur avec son employeur, il est indubitable que le demandeur n'a pas été affecté de façon temporaire à un travail à l'étranger. Son travail à l'étranger a plutôt débuté au moment où il a été embauché et s'est poursuivi jusqu'à l'expiration de son contrat, près de trois années plus tard. De plus, il n'y a tout simplement aucune preuve que l'employeur avait convenu de garder le demandeur à son service au Canada après cette période. Ce dernier a juste dit à l'audience qu'il voulait maintenant parler à l'employeur pour lui dire qu'il voulait travailler au Canada et savoir s'il était possible d'envoyer à sa place un autre employé à l'étranger (DPI, page 28, Transcription des débats, lignes 10 à 15). Je suis donc d'avis que la conclusion de la SAI selon laquelle le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté du fardeau d'établir qu'il avait satisfait aux exigences prévues au paragraphe 61(3) du RIPR est raisonnable.
[22]
Bien que le demandeur ait mis en doute, dans ses observations écrites seulement, le caractère suffisant des motifs, la Cour suprême du Canada, dans un arrêt récent:
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACS 62, indique clairement que lorsqu'il y a, comme c'est le cas en l'espèce, des motifs exposés, toute contestation du raisonnement formulé ou du résultat de la décision de l'agent doit se faire dans le cadre de l'analyse de la raisonnabilité. Comme il a été mentionné plus tôt, j'ai conclu que la décision de la SAI est raisonnable et que ses motifs sont étayés par le dossier.
B.
La SAI a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en n'ajournant pas l'audience?
[23]
D'après le demandeur, la SAI aurait dû ajourner l'audience quand il est devenu évident que son avocate était incompétente. Le fait de ne pas l'avoir ajournée était, allègue-t-il, un manquement à la justice naturelle.
[24]
Comme il se trouve toujours en Chine, le demandeur n'a pas pu assister à l'audience, mais il y a plutôt pris part au téléphone. Il a fallu faire appel pour lui à un interprète afin de faire la traduction entre le cantonnais et l'anglais. Deux personnes ont été présentes à l'audience pour représenter le demandeur: Mme Leung s'y trouvait à titre de représentante d'une organisation bénévole, tandis que M. Lam était un ami du père du demandeur, l'ayant rencontré par l'entremise de la Guangzhou Huadu Benevolent Association.
[25]
Il a tout d'abord été question de savoir si les bons formulaires de représentation avaient été présentés. Il a été conclu que Mme Leung avait bel et bien présenté les formulaires exigés, mais pas M. Lam. Mme Leung a demandé que l'on ajourne l'audience car M. Lam et elle n'avaient compris que tout récemment que l'audience allait avoir lieu et ils ne s'y étaient pas préparés. Mme Leung a tenté d'expliquer la confusion, disant à un certain moment (DPI, pages 15 et 16, Transcription des débats, lignes 38 à 40 et 1 à 5):
[traduction]
Nous voulons seulement vous dire ce qui s'est passé parce que c'est la première fois que nous nous présentons devant vous et que nous ignorons totalement comment procéder. Et le fait est que nous avons reçu une lettre cette fin de semaine-ci - ce n'est que cette fin de semaine que M. Bi l'a appris parce que nous - les (inaudible) nous les avons avisés d'un changement d'adresse. Ils l'ont envoyée à une maison vide parce qu'il est coincé en Chine et la lettre dit que le document n'a pas été lu; dimanche, c'était donc la panique. Nous avons aussitôt écrit ici - envoyé un fax la nuit dernière à huit heures, et l'accusé de réception indique qu'il a été reçu ce matin, disant que nous ne savons pas - nous ne comprenons pas ce qui se passe.
À ce moment, la présidente de l'audience de la SAI [la commissaire] a interrompu Mme Leung, disant qu'elle allait procéder à l'audience. Elle a ajouté que Mme Leung ne devrait pas accepter d'aider des gens si elle ne savait pas réellement ce qui se passait. Elle a également indiqué qu'elle était disposée à guider le demandeur dans le processus habituel et, ensuite, s'il le fallait, Mme Leung ou M. Lam pourraient poser d'autres questions avant que l'avocate du ministre pose les siennes. Elle a ajouté qu'étant donné que du temps avait été réservé pour cette journée-là, il était inutile de gaspiller l'argent des contribuables, et elle a ensuite procédé à l'audience. Rien de ce qui précède n'a été traduit au demandeur.
[26]
Une autre discussion a suivi pour décider si M. Lam aiderait Mme Leung pendant l'audience ou, alors, s'il allait témoigner et si on lui demanderait donc de quitter la salle. Il a finalement été décidé que M. Lam resterait. Voici d'autres commentaires de la commissaire qui sont pertinents à l'égard de la question de l'équité procédurale et de la compétence de l'avocate du demandeur: [traduction] « [l] a question de savoir si [le demandeur] va bénéficier ou non d'une audience équitable ne posera pas de problème. Je vais le guider dans tout le processus » (DPI, page 18, Transcription des débats, lignes 31 et 32) et [traduction] « [o] ui, très bien, je l'accepte. Mais, monsieur, comme je l'ai dit, vous ne devriez pas accepter de jouer le rôle de représentant si vous ne suivez pas les règles et si vous ne connaissez pas les règles; vous devriez apprendre les règles avant de représenter quelqu'un » (DPI, page 21, Transcription des débats, lignes 16 à 18). Je signale également que Mme Leung n'a posé que quelques questions, dont aucune sur l'emploi du demandeur auprès d'une entreprise canadienne ou sur les conditions du contrat. En fait, Mme Leung n'était manifestement pas dans son élément, comme l'illustre l'échange suivant (DPI, page 41, Transcription des débats, lignes 13 à 21):
[traduction]
La commissaire: Très bien. Y a-t-il d'autres questions en réplique que vous voudriez poser?
Mme Leung: La dernière question au sujet du fait qu'il n'a pas dit à [...] canadien - mais j'ai - la pièce 6 ici -
La commissaire: Madame, avez-vous une question à poser? Les observations viennent après.
Mme Leung: Oh, je ferai mieux de lui demander. Oh mon Dieu! Je ne sais pas - je m'excuse.
Les observations finales de Mme Leung montrent elles aussi sans l'ombre d'un doute qu'elle ne connaissait pas la procédure, son rôle, ni même les questions en litige (DPI, pages 42 à 44, Transcription des débats).
[27]
M. Lam n'était pas mieux placé, paraissant nerveux (selon Mme Leung) et ayant de la difficulté à s'exprimer en anglais. Quand la commissaire lui a demandé s'ils avaient une réplique, Mme Leung a demandé si M. Lam pouvait parler en chinois et faire traduire ses propos en anglais. La commissaire a répondu qu'étant donné son rôle de représentant, M. Lam devait s'exprimer en anglais (DPI, page 45, Transcription des débats, lignes 23 à 27). Voici un autre échange qui illustre bien la situation (DPI, pages 46 et 47, Transcription des débats, à partir de la ligne 14):
[traduction]
La commissaire: Si les documents ne sont pas véridiques, ce serait illégal.
Mme Leung: Oui.
M. Lam: Alors, bien sûr, monsieur - je m'excuse, je n'ai pas pu faire de commentaires sur - je veux juste que l'honorable commissaire considère simplement tous les faits qui lui ont été fournis et - je suis désolé madame, j'ai oublié les mots et je -
Mme Leung: Calmez-vous. Prenez le temps de vous calmer, et vous direz ce que vous voulez dire. Prenez le temps de vous calmer. Je sais que vous voulez dire quelque chose.
M. Lam: Ouais, reconsidérez la situation et donnez une chance à M. Bi de produire tout les documents. C'est sûr que les documents ne sont peut-être pas parfaits à 100 p. 100 pour ce qui est de répondre à l'exigence du ministère et j'ai - demandez s'il vous plaît à l'honorable madame de prendre en considération et d'examiner les documents que nous produisons.
La commissaire: Je vous remercie.
M. Lam: Merci.
La commissaire: Je vais surseoir au prononcé de ma décision, et je la communiquerai donc aux parties dans quelques semaines. Je ne ferai qu'un seul commentaire. À l'avenir, si l'un ou l'autre de vous avez l'intention d'aider des gens, soit auprès de la Section d'appel de l'immigration soit ailleurs, demandez à cette organisation quelles sont les règles; suivez ces règles bien avant la date d'audience et, en fait, allez assister à une audience, parce qu'elles sont habituellement publiques, pour savoir ce qu'il faut faire ou ce que vous pouvez faire ou non pour pouvoir mieux aider la personne que vous essayez d'aider, car vous ne bénéficierez peut-être pas d'autant de latitude que ce serait le cas dans ce genre de circonstances. Il n'est généralement pas utile qu'une personne offre son aide si elle n'est pas sûre de ce qu'elle fait.
[28]
Pour convaincre la Cour que la SAI a commis une erreur en n'ajournant pas l'audience, le demandeur se doit d'établir que les actes ou les omissions de son avocat relèvent de l'incompétence et ont occasionné une erreur de justice (
R c GDB
, 2000 CSC 22, paragraphe 26, [2000] 1 RCS 520 [
GDB
]). Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la Cour a appliqué le critère énoncé dans l'arrêt
GDB
, confirmant que le droit à l'assistance effective d'un avocat a été reconnu dans le contexte des réfugiés et que le paragraphe 167(1) de la LIPR reconnaît aux personnes faisant l'objet de poursuites devant la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié le droit d'être représentées par un avocat. La Cour a également formulé la mise en garde suivante ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, paragraphe 36):
[36] Cependant, dans les poursuites intentées en vertu de la LIPR, l'incompétence de l'avocat ne constituera un manquement aux principes de justice naturelle que dans des [traduction] « circonstances extraordinaires » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 15 (C.F. 1ère inst.). En ce qui concerne le volet « examen du travail »,« l'incompétence ou la négligence du représentant [doit ressortir] de la preuve de façon suffisamment claire et précise » (
Shirwa
, ci-dessus, à la page 60). Quant au volet « appréciation du préjudice »,
la Cour doit être convaincue qu'une erreur judiciaire en a résulté
. Compte tenu de la nature extraordinaire de ce motif de contestation, le« travail » doit être exceptionnel et « l'erreur judiciaire » doit prendre la forme d'un manquement à l'équité procédurale- la fiabilité de l'issue du procès ayant été compromise - ou toute autre forme évidente.[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[29]
Il ne fait aucun doute que Mme Leung et M. Lam n'étaient pas qualifiés pour agir en tant qu'avocats du demandeur. Ni l'un ni l'autre ne semblaient avoir suivi une formation en droit, ni même avoir une connaissance élémentaire de la procédure. Ce fait a aussi sauté rapidement aux yeux de la commissaire, qui a déclaré que, même si elle allait procéder à l'audience, elle était disposée à guider le demandeur dans tout le processus habituel. Elle a déclaré à un certain point: [traduction] « [l]a question de savoir si [le demandeur] va bénéficier ou non d'une audience équitable ne posera pas de problème. Je vais le guider dans tout le processus » (DPI, page 18, Transcription des débats, lignes 31 et 32).
[30]
Le demandeur signale que la SAI a fondé sa décision en partie sur de présumées divergences et omissions contenues dans son témoignage. Il soutient que même si cela constitue habituellement un motif acceptable pour conclure qu'il ne s'est pas acquitté du fardeau de prouver ses prétentions, la commissaire a décidé en l'espèce de procéder à l'interrogatoire principal. Il lui était donc possible de poser au demandeur les questions qui auraient pu dissiper ses doutes et, en s'abstenant de le faire et en fondant sa décision sur le fait que ce dernier n'avait pas traité convenablement des questions en litige, elle a manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale. À cela s'ajoutait le fait qu'elle n'avait pas ajourné l'audience quand on lui avait demandé au départ de le faire.
[31]
Le défendeur est d'avis que le demandeur n'a pas démontré que l'incompétence de son avocate avait entraîné une erreur de justice et n'a pas établi qu'il y avait une probabilité raisonnable que, n'eût été cette incompétence, la SAI serait arrivée à une conclusion différente ou que le processus d'audience avait été inéquitable.
[32]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2005] ACF 1672, mon collègue, le juge Harrington, a fait remarquer ce qui suit: « [i]l existe une jurisprudence abondante en la matière selon laquelle une partie doit subir les conséquences des actes de son avocat. Je suis du même avis. Si la cause a été mal préparée, si la jurisprudence pertinente n'a pas été portée à l'attention de la Cour dans une affaire au civil ou si les témoins ont été mal choisis, c'est la partie concernée qui doit en subir les conséquences ». Je suis d'avis qu'en l'espèce les faits sont analogues aux exemples que le juge Harrington a donnés. Le demandeur a simplement retenu les services de représentants non formés et non qualifiés dont on n'aurait pas pu attendre davantage, et il doit malheureusement en subir les conséquences. Le demandeur a toutefois bénéficié des services d'un avocat à un certain moment. Une demande de prorogation de délai a été présentée à cause du retrait de son avocat et du temps nécessaire pour en trouver un autre (DPI, page 218).
[33]
Dans l'arrêt
R c Dunbar
, 2003 BCCA 667, au paragraphe 26, [2003] BCJ 2767, la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique a analysé comme suit le volet « appréciation du préjudice »:
[traduction]
[26] Le volet « appréciation du préjudice » oblige l'appelant à démontrer qu'à cause de l'incompétence d'un avocat, une erreur de justice a été commise. Le juge d'appel Doherty a analysé le sens de l'expression « erreur de justice » dans ce contexte dans
Joanisse
, précité, au paragraphe 64. Une erreur de justice, a-t-il expliqué, peut être attribuable au fait que l'appelant établit une probabilité raisonnable que, sans les erreurs de l'avocat, l'issue de l'instance aurait été différente. Une probabilité raisonnable est une probabilité qui« suffit à enlever confiance dans l'issue de l'action » et qui « réside quelque part entre une simple possibilité et une vraisemblance »:
Joanisse
, précité, au paragraphe 62;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.C.C. (3d) 303, à la page 319. En revanche, une issue fiable peut quand même constituer une erreur de justice si le processus par lequel ce verdict a été rendu était inéquitable:
Joanisse
, précité, au paragraphe 62;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  mon avis, le demandeur n'a pas démontré qu'il y avait une probabilité raisonnable que, n'eût été son avocate, l'issue de l'instance aurait été différente. Lorsqu'il a répondu aux questions qu'on lui posait, le demandeur n'a tout simplement pas donné des réponses claires et satisfaisantes qui auraient établi qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences prévues au paragraphe 61(3) du RIPR. La conclusion de la SAI n'est pas attribuable au fait que l'on a posé des questions insuffisantes à l'audience, comme l'allègue le demandeur; elle est plutôt le reflet des réponses du demandeur et des éléments de preuve qu'il a produits. Je conclus donc qu'il n'y a pas eu de manquement à l'équité procédurale en l'espèce et que la décision de la SAI était raisonnable.
[34]
Les avocats n'ont pas présenté de questions à certifier.
JUGEMENT
[35]
LA COUR ORDONNE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée, et aucune question ne sera certifiée.
