REASONS FOR ORDER AND ORDER
UPON
motion on behalf of the applicant to appeal Prothonotary Tabib's October 17, 2011 decision;
UPON
considering the applicant's motion, the responding motion record of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, and their representations before me.
ENSORSEMENT
[1]
Tremblay-Lamer, J.
: I fully agree with Prothonotary Tabib's reasons for refusing the disclosure of the documents requested by the applicant, considering these documents are indeed protected by solicitor-client privilege. The applicant has not established that "(a) the questions raised are vital to the final issue of the case, or (b) the orde[r] [is] clearly wrong as based upon wrong principle or misapprehension of facts" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[2]
Contrary to the applicant's submissions, Prothonotary Tabib did not apply the wrong standard of proof, nor did she conduct an improper analysis. Rather, after having examined the unredacted portions of the document, specifically the proposed Exhibit 28, the Prothonotary concluded that
prima facie
, it was protected by solicitor-client privilege. At page 2 of her decision, Prothonotary Tabib clearly stated that, based on the uncontradicted affidavit, corroborated by the unredacted portions of the email exchanges, the document met the criteria for protection as privileged solicitor-client communications (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[3]
Such communications do not fall within an exception to privilege, as stated by the Prothonotary: the applicant did not prove fraud or any unlawful conduct on the part of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, even if this Court were to follow the reasoning set out by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], as suggested by the applicant. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> suggests broadening the exceptions to privilege to include communications made with a view of perpetrating tortuous conduct which may be subject of civil litigation, whereby there was an intent to commit an unlawful act, whether such act be criminal or tortuous. Even though, as explained by Prothonotary Tabib in her decision, the correctness of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is highly debatable and leave to appeal was granted, this case reiterates the accepted principle that mere assertions of illegality are
insufficient
: the applicant had to provide evidence of the Human Rights Commission's supposed illegal purpose ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 43). Such evidence being absent, the applicant seemingly relying on speculation, Prothonotoary Tabib's order is not wrong, nor have any questions vital to the final issue of the case been raised. Thus, the present appeal must be dismissed.
[4]
I would also like to add, for the benefit of the applicant, that since the document is privileged, "the facts contained in the communication as between client and solicitor are also privileged" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Therefore, the applicant is not entitled to receive the document, nor the divulgation of portions of its content, regardless of whether or not the information contained in the emails are mere facts.
[5]
Lastly, while the applicant does not appeal the portion of the Prothonotary's decision with regards to her jurisdiction to order a party to return documents which were inadvertently disclosed, the Human Rights Commission now argues that this portion of Prothonotary Tabib's decision is wrong. Regardless, in the Commission's opinion, not only did the Prothonotary have jurisdiction, but this Court now also has jurisdiction to order the applicant to return the document. This Court remains unconvinced and cannot find anything at this time on which to ground its jurisdiction. As stated by Prothonotary Tabib, the Commission is not even a party to the judicial review application and the document in question is not part of the record before me, nor the Prothonotary.
[6]
The procedural context within which we find ourselves cannot be forgotten: this is an appeal from a prothonotary's order and not the actual judicial review. While this Court does have jurisdiction to make interim orders it considers appropriate pending the disposition of the judicial review under subsection 18.2 of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC 1985, c F-7, such a request has not been properly made by the Human Rights Commission: no motion has been filed. It is not by merely inserting the request in its motion record that this Court now has jurisdiction to order the applicant to return documents that were inadvertently disclosed to him by the Commission, when the Commission is not even a party to the judicial review application.
[7]
While the Human Rights Commission relies on the Federal Court of Appeal's ruling in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] to assert this Court's jurisdiction to order the return of inadvertently disclosed documents protected by privilege, that case can be distinguished from the case before me today: there is no motion before me requesting the return of the document and the Commission is not a party to the judicial review application (see paragraphs 38-39 and Justice Hughes' Direction at para 14 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> stating how such requests should be formulated).
[8]
Thus, at this time, the Court is not seized: no proper procedural vehicle has been used for the Court to possibly order the document be returned, seeing as it is not even part of the record before it. Moreover, the document in question is clearly privileged and could never be included in the Applicant's Record. As such, it serves no real purpose to the applicant because
it can never be used in evidence
, as further explained by Prothonotary Aronovitch in her March 20, 2012 Order. Due to its futility in the applicant's judicial review, I strongly suggest that the applicant return the inadvertently disclosed privileged document to the Human Rights Commission.
ORDER
[9]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
:
1. The appeal be dismissed.
2. No costs shall be awarded.
