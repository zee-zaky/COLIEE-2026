[1]
de Montigny, J.
: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA or the Act) of a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the RPD), dated June 27, 2012, whereby it was decided that Pinderjit Singh (the Applicant) was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, I have come to the conclusion that this application must be dismissed.
Facts
[3]
The Applicant is a 42 year-old Sikh farmer from a small Punjab village in India. The facts that he presented to the RPD are the following.
[4]
The Applicant hired a Sikh man named Sukhdev Singh as a labourer in June 2006. Sukhdev was housed in a building on the farm. The Applicant informed his Sarpanch and the village watchman, as per custom, of the presence of Sukhdev Singh on the farm.
[5]
On January 16, 2007, two rural-looking Sikh men visited Sukhdev Singh. The three of them left the farm together. On that same day, the police came looking for Sukhdev Singh and raided the Applicant's house. The police told the Applicant that Sukhdev was a wanted terrorist. The Applicant was taken into custody. The police questioned him on the whereabouts of Sukhdev Singh and accused him of harbouring a terrorist and being a militant himself. The Applicant was tortured for four days and released with the help of the Applicant's Panchayat and a bribe of 40 000 rupees. The Applicant was released upon the condition that he would produce Sukhdev Singh and his colleagues as soon as possible.
[6]
On the evening of June 29, 2007, Sukhdev Singh showed up at the farmhouse. The Applicant tried to hold him down but Sukhdev threatened the Applicant with a pistol. Sukhdev left the farmhouse that same evening. Early the next day, the police once again raided the Applicant's house and arrested him. Once again, the Applicant was tortured for four days. He was released with the help of his Sarpanch and a bribe of 50 000 rupees. He was released upon the condition that he must report to the police station every month and help with the arrest of Sukhdev Singh.
[7]
Unable to satisfy police demands, the Applicant moved to Moleke in the district of Amristar, where he stayed for two months. The Applicant decided to flee India and arrived in Canada on September 20, 2007. The Applicant worked on a farm until late August 2009, in the hope of obtaining permanent resident status. During that time, although the Applicant received room and board, but no salary, $12,000 was sent to his family in India.
[8]
The Applicant left the farm in late August 2009. He arrived in Montreal on September 4, 2009 and claimed refugee status on September 8, 2009.
The impugned decision
[9]
The RPD found that the Applicant was not credible and that, in any case, he had a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in New Delhi.
[10]
With respect to credibility, the RPD took issue with a number of implausible elements in the Applicant's story:
• the police waited six months after Sukhdev Singh was hired before attending the Applicant's home;
• the Applicant's Sarpanch and the village watchman did not go to the police between the two arrests because of "lack of courage";
• the police nearly missed Sukhdev Singh on two occasions;
• the Applicant did not immediately go to the police station or contact someone on the night Sukhdev Singh returned to his farm.
[11]
The RPD also took issue with the fact that the Applicant had not "directly answered" when asked why his Sarpanch and the village watchman had not explained to the police that he had informed them of Sukhdev Singh's presence on the farm.
[12]
The RPD noted that the Applicant's story was not corroborated by general documentary evidence. The RPD referred to documents indicating that Sikh militant movements were no longer active in Punjab.
[13]
The Applicant also submitted two affidavits in support of his allegations: one from the Sarpanch who helped with his release from police detention, and the other from his village's current Sarpanch. The RPD did not address the content of these affidavits, because it did not find the Applicant credible and because of the prevalence of fraudulent documents in India.
[14]
On the issue of the availability of an IFA, the RPD considered that even if it had believed the Applicant's testimony, he would be safe in New Delhi. The RPD noted that the Applicant was not subject to an arrest warrant and that he was only wanted for having harboured a terrorist. The documentary information revealed that police would pursue in other regions only hard-core militants who are wanted by the central authorities, which is not the case of the Applicant.
Issues
[15]
This application for judicial review raises two issues:
a) Are the RPD's credibility findings reasonable?
b) Was it reasonable to conclude that the Applicant had an IFA in New Delhi?
Analysis
[16]
It is settled law that credibility and plausibility findings are to be reviewed against the reasonableness standard: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1753;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 150. However, plausibility findings may be more easily overturned than credibility findings based on behaviour or contradicting testimony.
[17]
The reasonableness standard also applies to the conclusion that the Applicant had an IFA in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 624;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 1123.
[18]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
a) Are the RPD's credibility findings reasonable?
[19]
Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the RPD's credibility findings are flawed for a number of reasons. First he argued that there is no supporting evidence as to what information the police had and when it was obtained with respect to Sukhdev Singh, and that the RPD therefore had no basis to conclude that he was wanted by the police before the police raided the Applicant's house for the first time. Second, contrary to the RPD's finding that the Applicant did not respond directly when asked if the Sarpanch and the village watchman had told the police that he had informed them of Sukhdev Singh's presence, counsel asserted that the Applicant testified that he did inform the police at the time of his first arrest that he had reported Sukhdev Singh once he had started living on his property, and that the Sarpanch and the watchman had indeed gone to the police and informed them about the Applicant's registration of Sukhdev Singh back in June 2006. Finally, it is contended that the RPD failed to consider the Applicant's reasons for not having gone to the police immediately after Sukhdev Singh returned to his farm.
[20]
Having carefully considered the record and the submissions of the parties, I am unable to find that the RPD's conclusions are unreasonable. While some inferences drawn by the Board may appear questionable, there were enough implausibilities in the Applicant's story to put his credibility at issue. First, if the police were told that Sukhdev was living with the Applicant since June of 2006, it is extremely unlikely that the evening Sukhdev left the house would be the same evening that the police decided to visit.
[21]
The Applicant's explanation that Sukhdev was not of interest to the police until he was visited by two men is also unsatisfactory. Contrary to what the Applicant now claims, he claimed in his Personal Information Form (PIF) that the police told him that Sukhdev was a terrorist, not simply a suspect. If the police knew that Sukhdev was a terrorist, their file was not limited to informer reports indicating that he had left the house in the company of the two strangers. Furthermore, the Applicant's speculation that Sukhdev only became known to the police on January 16, 2007 is contradicted by the allegation that Sukhdev was being sought because he had been evading arrest. Given the evidence in the Applicant's PIF, it was reasonable to conclude that the police must have been interested in Sukhdev before January 16th. It is therefore illogical to claim that the police would have waited until their informers told them that Sukhdev had left the farmhouse before trying to arrest him there.
[22]
It is not entirely clear from the transcript of the hearing whether, following the Applicant's first arrest, the Sarpanch and the village watchman told the police that the Applicant had informed them of Sukhdev Singh's presence. It appears that the Sarpanch and the watchman, when asked by the Applicant after his first release, told him that they had gone to the police and told them of Sukhdev Singh's presence but were afraid to go back and reiterate that they were informed by the Applicant. Yet this is an illogical explanation. It is implausible that the Sarpanch and the watchman would feel comfortable arranging his release with a bribe, but would be too afraid to go to the police to confirm that the Applicant had informed them of Sukhdev Singh's presence at the first opportunity after his release.
[23]
The RPD considered the explanation given by the Applicant for not going immediately to the police after Sukhdev came back on the night of June 29, 2007. The Applicant testified that he had been threatened with a pistol by Sukhdev Singh. The Board found, however, that having allegedly been tortured for four days and released on the promise to produce Sukhdev Singh, it would be expected that he would have tried as soon as possible to contact someone who would let the authorities know.
[24]
The Applicant does not contest the Board's conclusion, but offered a new explanation before the Court, to the effect that he was afraid of contacting the police because his house was under police surveillance. That explanation does not make sense either, as this would simply make it easier for him to inform the police of Sukhdev's visit and more importantly, to demonstrate to the police without delay that he was willing to assist them.
[25]
The Applicant also submitted that the Board erred in failing to consider the two corroborating affidavits from the current Sarpanch of his village and from the Sarpanch at the relevant times, which both corroborate the Applicant's story and support the Applicant's allegations of persecution.
[26]
I agree with the Applicant that the way the two affidavits were handled by the RPD is somewhat problematic. First of all, the fact that inauthentic documents are easily available in India does not relieve the RPD of the duty to determine whether the documents presented by the Applicant are genuine or not:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 21. Moreover, it is inappropriate to rely on these documents for some purposes and to dismiss them when they would tend to corroborate the Applicant's story. That being said, I note that the two affidavits are identical for all material purposes, which would tend to undermine their genuineness. In and of themselves, they are certainly not sufficient to bolster the Applicant's case and to cure the many implausibilities of his story. When considered in light of the documentary evidence referred to by the Board, indicating that there were no reports of Sikh arrests or detention in the period in which the Applicant alleges he was detained, it cannot be said that the RPD's treatment of the affidavits is fatal to its decision.
[27]
For all of the above reasons, I am of the view that the RPD's assessment of the Applicant's credibility is reasonable and "falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law".
b) Was it reasonable to conclude that the Applicant had an IFA in New Delhi?
[28]
Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the RPD erred in framing the risk that the Applicant faces in India. The Applicant maintains that he has a well-founded fear of persecution from the Indian authorities because he was alleged to be associated with dangerous militants, possessed information on these militants and failed to respect the conditions of his release. In his view, the Board failed to appreciate that he was in fact wanted not because he was a militant, but because he was suspected of collaborating with militants. In other words, the Board failed to assess his profile through the eyes of his agents of persecution, the Punjab police, and erroneously came to the conclusion that he could not have a well-founded fear of persecution since he was not a militant. Such a misperception led the Board to conclude that the Applicant would have an IFA in New Delhi.
[29]
I agree with the Applicant that the persecutor's point of view must be taken into account when assessing the risk a refugee claimant would be exposed to upon removal. That being said, I do not think that the Board failed to properly evaluate the real cause of the Applicant's fear. The Applicant was never alleged to be a hard-core militant or even a dissident. He was apparently mistreated because he was perceived to be a possible associate of the militant Sukhdev, to have harboured him and to have not cooperated with the police.
[30]
The real disagreement of the Applicant with the RPD has to do with the RPD's finding that the Punjab police are unlikely to pursue a Sikh outside of Punjab unless they are one of a handful of hard-core militants. Although there is some evidence in the National Documentation Package suggesting that no IFA is available to Sikhs, the Board noted that this evidence was based primarily on events in the 1990s. The Board was entitled to prefer more recent information, indicating that when an applicant has alleged problems only with the local police, an IFA is possible. Sukhdev himself may or may not be perceived as a sufficiently important target to justify a pursuit outside of Punjab, however, there is no evidence to indicate that the Applicant is the sort of person the Punjab police would waste resources pursuing in other states. The authority's lack of interest in the Applicant is further demonstrated by the absence of any warrant for his arrest.
[31]
The profile of the Applicant was most certainly a relevant factor to determine whether he could safely relocate within India. It was incumbent upon the Applicant to establish that he would be pursued throughout India, or that registration in a different state would place him in harm's way. Having failed to do so, the Board could reasonably conclude that the Applicant would be safe if he relocated to New Delhi. This conclusion, in and of itself, was sufficient to warrant the rejection of the Applicant's claim.
Conclusion
[32]
For all of the above reasons, I find that this application for judicial review ought to be dismissed. No question for certification was proposed, and none will be certified.
JUDGMENT
[33]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed. No question is certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi], de la décision datée du 27 juin 2012 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés [la SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a conclu que Pinderjit Singh (le demandeur) n'avait ni qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger aux termes de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que la présente demande doit être rejetée.
Faits
[3]
Le demandeur est un agriculteur sikh de 42 ans qui vient d'un petit village du Pendjab, en Inde. Les faits qu'il a exposés à la SPR sont les suivants.
[4]
Le demandeur a embauché un ouvrier sikh nommé Sukhdev Singh, en juin 2006. Sukhdev était hébergé dans un bâtiment à la ferme. Comme le veut la coutume, le demandeur a informé le
sarpanch
et le gardien du village de la présence de Sukhdev Singh à la ferme.
[5]
Le 16 janvier 2007, deux hommes sikhs qui semblaient venir d'un milieu rural ont rendu visite à Sukhdev Singh. Les trois sont partis ensemble. Le même jour, des policiers se sont rendus à la ferme. Ils cherchaient Sukhdev Singh et ont fouillé sa maison. Les policiers ont dit au demandeur que Sukhdev était un terroriste recherché. Le demandeur a été placé en détention et questionné sur les allées et venues de Sukhdev Singh. Les policiers l'accusaient d'avoir hébergé un terroriste et d'être lui-même un militant. Le demandeur a été torturé pendant quatre jours, puis libéré grâce à l'intervention de son
panchayat
et au paiement d'un pot-de-vin de 40 000 roupies. Il a dû également promettre de livrer Sukhdev Singh et ses acolytes le plus tôt possible.
[6]
Dans la soirée du 29 juin 2007, Sukhdev Singh est revenu à la ferme. Le demandeur a essayé de le retenir, mais Sukhdev l'a menacé d'un pistolet. Sukhdev a quitté la ferme le soir même. Tôt le lendemain, les policiers ont effectué une autre descente à la maison du demandeur et l'ont arrêté. Le demandeur a encore une fois été torturé pendant quatre jours, puis relâché grâce à l'intervention de son
sarpanch
et au paiement d'un pot-de-vin de 50 000 roupies. Le demandeur a été libéré à condition de se présenter au poste de police chaque mois et de collaborer à l'arrestation de Sukhdev Singh.
[7]
Incapable de satisfaire aux demandes des policiers, le demandeur a déménagé à Moleke dans le district d'Amritsar et y est resté deux mois. Il a décidé de quitter l'Inde et est arrivé au Canada le 20 septembre 2007. Le demandeur a travaillé dans une ferme jusqu'à la fin du mois d'août 2009, dans l'espoir d'obtenir le statut de résident permanent. Pendant cette période, bien que le demandeur ait été nourri et logé sans recevoir de salaire, 12 000 $ ont été envoyés à sa famille en Inde.
[8]
Le demandeur a quitté la ferme en août 2009. Il est arrivé à Montréal le 4 septembre 2009 et a demandé l'asile le 8 septembre 2009.
Décision contestée
[9]
La SPR a conclu que le demandeur manquait de crédibilité et que, en tout état de cause, il avait une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) viable à New Delhi.
[10]
En ce qui concerne la crédibilité, la SPR a mis en doute certains éléments non plausibles du récit du demandeur:
• une période de six mois s'était écoulée entre l'embauche de Sukhdev Singh et la visite des policiers à la maison du demandeur;
• le
sarpanch
du demandeur et le gardien du village n'étaient pas allés voir les policiers entre les deux arrestations parce qu'ils n'avaient « pas le courage » de le faire;
• les policiers avaient manqué Sukhdev Singh de justesse à deux occasions;
• le demandeur ne s'était pas immédiatement rendu au poste de police la nuit où Sukhdev Singh était revenu à la ferme ni n'avait immédiatement communiqué avec quelqu'un.
[11]
La SPR a également relevé le fait que le demandeur n'avait pas « répond[u] directement » à la question de savoir pourquoi le
sarpanch
et le gardien du village n'avaient pas expliqué à la police qu'il les avait avisés de la présence de Sukhdev Singh à la ferme.
[12]
La SPR a constaté que la preuve documentaire générale ne corroborait pas le récit du demandeur. La SPR a renvoyé aux documents indiquant que les mouvements militants sikhs n'étaient plus actifs au Pendjab.
[13]
Le demandeur a également déposé deux affidavits à l'appui de ses allégations: un affidavit souscrit par le
sarpanch
qui s'était présenté au poste de police pour faire libérer le demandeur, et un souscrit par le
sarpanch
actuel du village. La SPR ne s'est pas intéressée au contenu de ces affidavits en raison du manque de crédibilité du demandeur et de la fréquence des documents frauduleux en Inde.
[14]
En ce qui a trait à la PRI, quand bien même elle aurait prêté foi au témoignage du demandeur, la SPR a estimé qu'il serait en sécurité à New Delhi. La SPR a fait remarquer qu'aucun mandat d'arrestation n'avait été lancé contre le demandeur, qui était seulement recherché pour avoir hébergé un terroriste. La preuve documentaire a révélé que la police poursuivait dans d'autres régions les militants purs et durs recherchés par les autorités centrales, ce qui n'est pas le cas du demandeur.
Questions en litige
[15]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève deux questions:
a) Les conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR sont-elles raisonnables?
b) Était-il raisonnable de conclure que le demandeur avait une PRI à New Delhi?
Analyse
[16]
Il est de droit constant que les conclusions sur la crédibilité et sur la vraisemblance doivent être contrôlées selon la norme de la décision raisonnable: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF no 1753;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] ACF no 150. Toutefois, il est plus facile de réfuter les conclusions sur la vraisemblance que les conclusions sur la crédibilité d'après le comportement ou un témoignage contradictoire.
[17]
La norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique aussi à la conclusion selon laquelle le demandeur a une PRI à  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 624;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22, 166 ACWS (3d) 1123.
[18]
Lorsqu'une décision est contrôlée selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse s'attache « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47.
a) Les conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR sont-elles raisonnables?
[19]
L'avocat du demandeur soutient que les conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR sont erronées pour un certain nombre de raisons. Premièrement, il affirme qu'aucun élément de preuve ne corrobore la teneur des renseignements sur Sukhdev Singh que possédait la police ni le moment où elle avait obtenu lesdits renseignements, et que rien ne permettait donc à la SPR de conclure que Sukhdev Singh était recherché par la police avant que la police n'effectue sa première descente à la maison du demandeur. Deuxièmement, contrairement à la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le demandeur n'avait pas répondu directement à la question de savoir si le
sarpanch
et le gardien du village avaient dit à la police que le demandeur les avait informés de la présence de Sukhdev Singh, l'avocat affirme que le demandeur a témoigné avoir dit à la police, au moment de sa première arrestation, qu'il avait signalé la présence de Sukhdev Singh quand ce dernier était venu habiter chez lui, et que le
sarpanch
et le gardien s'étaient bel et bien présentés à la police pour l'informer que le demandeur avait signalé la présence de Sukhdev Singh en juin 2006. Enfin, l'avocat soutient que la SPR a fait abstraction des raisons pour lesquelles le demandeur ne s'était pas immédiatement rendu au poste de police quand Sukhdev Singh est revenu à la ferme.
[20]
Après avoir soigneusement examiné le dossier et les observations des parties, je ne puis conclure que les conclusions de la SPR sont déraisonnables. Bien que certaines inférences tirées par la SPR puissent sembler discutables, le récit du demandeur contenait suffisamment d'invraisemblances pour jeter un doute sur la crédibilité de celui-ci. Premièrement, si la police avait été informée du fait que Sukhdev vivait chez le demandeur depuis juin 2006, il est extrêmement improbable qu'elle ait décidé de se présenter chez le demandeur le soir même où Sukhdev est parti.
[21]
L'explication donnée par le demandeur, à savoir que Sukhdev n'intéressait pas la police jusqu'à ce que deux hommes lui rendent visite, est également insatisfaisante. Contrairement à ce qu'il affirme maintenant, le demandeur a indiqué dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) que la police lui avait dit que Sukhdev était un terroriste, et non un simple suspect. Si la police savait que Sukhdev était un terroriste, son dossier contenait plus que de simples rapports produits par des informateurs révélant que Sukhdev avait quitté la maison en compagnie de deux hommes. De plus, l'hypothèse du demandeur voulant que la police se soit intéressée à Sukhdev le 16 janvier 2007 seulement est contredite par l'allégation selon laquelle Sukhdev était recherché pour s'être soustrait à son arrestation. Étant donné les renseignements contenus dans le FRP du demandeur, il était raisonnable de conclure que la police s'intéressait à Sukhdev avant le 16 janvier. Il est donc illogique de soutenir que la police avait attendu que ses informateurs l'avisent du départ de Sukhdev avant de tenter de l'arrêter à la ferme.
[22]
La transcription de l'audience ne révèle pas clairement si, après la première arrestation du demandeur, le
sarpanch
et le gardien du village ont dit à la police que le demandeur les avait informés de la présence de Sukhdev Singh. Lorsque le demandeur a été relâché après cette première arrestation, le
sarpanch
et le gardien lui auraient dit qu'ils s'étaient présentés à la police pour l'aviser de la présence de Sukhdev Singh, mais qu'ils avaient eu peur d'y retourner pour dire qu'ils avaient été informés par le demandeur. Il s'agit d'une explication illogique. Il est invraisemblable que le
sarpanch
et le gardien se soient sentis à l'aise d'organiser la mise en liberté du demandeur en versant un pot-de-vin, mais qu'ils aient eu peur d'aller voir la police pour confirmer que le demandeur les avait avisés de la présence de Sukhdev Singh tout de suite après la libération du demandeur.
[23]
La SPR a examiné la raison donnée par le demandeur pour expliquer pourquoi il n'était pas allé voir immédiatement la police après le retour de Sukhdev la nuit du 29 juin 2007. Le demandeur a témoigné que Sukhdev Singh l'avait menacé avec un pistolet. Toutefois, selon la SPR, il était permis de s'attendre à ce que le demandeur, qui affirmait avoir été torturé pendant quatre jours et relâché sur promesse de livrer Sukhdev Singh, ait tenté le plus tôt possible de communiquer avec quelqu'un qui aurait averti les autorités.
[24]
Le demandeur ne conteste pas la conclusion de la SPR, mais il présente une autre explication à la Cour: il aurait eu peur de communiquer avec la police parce que sa maison était sous surveillance policière. Cette explication n'a pas de sens non plus, car il n'en aurait été que plus facile pour le demandeur d'informer la police de la visite de Sukhdev et, chose encore plus importante, de manifester rapidement à la police sa volonté de l'aider.
[25]
Le demandeur soutient aussi que la SPR a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte des deux affidavits souscrits par l'actuel
sarpanch
de son village et par le
sarpanch
en poste à l'époque pertinente, qui corroborent son récit et appuient ses allégations de persécution.
[26]
Je conviens avec le demandeur que la façon dont la SPR a traité les deux affidavits pose problème. Premièrement, le fait qu'il soit facile d'obtenir de faux documents en Inde ne dispense pas la SPR de l'obligation de déterminer si les documents présentés par le demandeur sont authentiques ou non:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 54, 405 FTR 21. En outre, il est inapproprié de se fonder sur ces documents pour certaines fins et de les rejeter quand ils sembleraient corroborer le récit du demandeur. Cela dit, je constate que les deux affidavits sont pour ainsi dire identiques, ce qui inciterait à douter de leur authenticité. Ils ne sont certainement pas suffisants en eux-mêmes pour étayer la cause du demandeur et remédier aux nombreuses invraisemblances de son récit. À la lumière de la preuve documentaire mentionnée par la SPR, qui ne faisait état d'aucun rapport d'arrestation ou de détention de sikhs pendant la période de détention alléguée du demandeur, la façon dont la SPR a traité les affidavits ne saurait porter un coup fatal à sa décision.
[27]
Pour les motifs susmentionnés, j'estime que l'appréciation de la crédibilité du demandeur faite par la SPR est raisonnable et appartient « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
b) Était-il raisonnable de conclure que le demandeur avait une PRI à New Delhi?
[28]
L'avocat du demandeur soutient que la SPR a commis une erreur en définissant le risque auquel le demandeur était exposé en Inde. Le demandeur maintient qu'il craint avec raison d'être persécuté par les autorités indiennes, qui le soupçonneraient d'être associé à de dangereux militants, de posséder des renseignements sur ces militants et de ne pas avoir respecté les conditions de sa libération. De l'avis du demandeur, la SPR a omis d'apprécier le fait qu'il n'était pas recherché parce qu'il était un militant, mais parce qu'il était soupçonné d'avoir collaboré avec des militants. En d'autres mots, la SPR n'a pas apprécié son profil du point de vue de ses agents de persécution, à savoir la police du Pendjab, et est parvenue à la conclusion erronée qu'il ne pouvait craindre avec raison d'être persécuté étant donné qu'il n'était pas un militant. Cette perception fautive a incité la SPR à conclure que le demandeur aurait une PRI à New Delhi.
[29]
Je conviens avec le demandeur qu'il faut tenir compte du point de vue du persécuteur au moment d'apprécier le risque auquel un demandeur d'asile serait exposé par suite de son renvoi. Cela dit, je ne considère pas que la SPR a omis d'évaluer adéquatement la vraie cause de la crainte du demandeur. Il n'a jamais été allégué que le demandeur était un militant pur et dur ni même un dissident. Apparemment, le demandeur a été maltraité parce qu'il était vu comme un possible associé du militant Sukhdev, associé qui avait hébergé ce militant et qui n'avait pas collaboré avec la police.
[30]
Le vrai désaccord du demandeur avec la SPR concerne la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle il est improbable que la police du Pendjab poursuive un sikh à l'extérieur du Pendjab à moins qu'il ne fasse partie d'une poignée de militants purs et durs. Bien que certains éléments de preuve contenus dans le cartable national de documentation donnent à penser que les sikhs n'ont pas de PRI, la SPR a souligné que cette information était essentiellement fondée sur des incidents qui remontaient aux années 1990. La SPR avait le loisir de préférer de l'information plus récente, selon laquelle la réinstallation interne est possible quand les problèmes allégués du demandeur concernent la police locale. Sukhdev peut lui-même être ou ne pas être une cible assez importante pour justifier une poursuite à l'extérieur du Pendjab, mais rien dans la preuve ne montre que la police du Pendjab gaspillerait ses ressources afin de poursuivre dans d'autres régions une personne comme le demandeur. L'absence de mandat d'arrestation émis contre le demandeur démontre d'autant plus le manque d'intérêt des autorités à son égard.
[31]
Le profil du demandeur était assurément un facteur pertinent à prendre en considération en vue de déterminer s'il pouvait se réinstaller en Inde en toute sécurité. Il incombait au demandeur d'établir qu'il serait poursuivi partout en Inde, ou que l'inscription dans une autre région l'aurait mis en danger, à défaut de quoi la SPR pouvait raisonnablement conclure qu'il serait en sécurité s'il se réinstallait à New Delhi. Cette conclusion était suffisante en soi pour justifier le rejet de la demande d'asile du demandeur.
Conclusion
[32]
Pour tous les motifs exposés ci-dessus, je conclus que la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée. Aucune question n'a été proposée pour certification et aucune ne sera certifiée.
JUGEMENT
