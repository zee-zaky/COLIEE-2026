Denault, J.
[TRANSLATION]: In summer 1985 the plaintiff lost nearly all the mussels it had been cultivating for some years. It attributed the loss to the actions of the defendant's employees who deposited dredging spoils from the wharf at Neguac, New Brunswick, beside its mussel culture site.
[2]
In its statement of claim the plaintiff charged the defendant's employees with having, without its knowledge, discharged waste material which made the water turbid and filled it with sediment, thereby exposing the mussels to a habitat unfavourable to their survival and eventually causing the mussels it was raising to die. It further charged the defendant's employees with failing to inform it when they must have known that the plaintiff was continuing to raise mussels there, with taking no precautions to avoid tainting and with negligence in the way they disposed of the waste material. It relied on the Crown Liability Act (R.S.C. 1970, c. C-28) and failure by the defendant to observe the factors mentioned in the Ocean Dumping Control Act (S.C. 1974-75-76, c. 55) when it issued the dumping permit.
[3]
The plaintiff is accordingly claiming damages which it set at $366,500.00, plus general damages, interest and costs.
[4]
In her pleadings the defendant said she was not aware that Soleiko was raising mussels in Neguac Bay, and maintained that she deposited the dredging spoils from the Neguac wharf in accordance with dumping permits and with the necessary skill and care. She further alleged that if the court found that the defendant had been negligent, the plaintiff should also be held liable for contributory negligence due to the fact that it was given prior notice and because of the unorthodox and empirical manner in which it was conducting its mussel culture operations.
Evidence
Mussel culture in Neguac Bay
[5]
Neguac Bay, located along the New Brunswick coast beside the Northumberland Strait, is inside Miramichi Bay and is actually a lagoon entered from the sea through Portage Gully inter alia. It has two small fishing ports equipped with wharves, Neguac and Lower Neguac. Research on potential oysterrearing sites conducted by the New Brunswick Department of Fisheries from 1979 to 1981 showed that the temperature, salinity, oxygenation and turbidity of the water at this location made it a particularly suitable site for the rearing of mussels. Archie Allain, a Neguac teacher and fisherman, soon became interested in this project and on April 1, 1982 signed an oyster lease with the federal Department of Fisheries for the rearing of mussels over a twenty-year period. The site in question has a surface area 3,000 feet long by 600 feet wide and is approximately one mile east of the Neguac wharf and a similar distance from that of Lower Neguac. On January 6, 1983 the Department of Transport issued an exemption declaration pursuant to the Navigable Waters Protection Act. Archie Allain soon interested his three brothers in the project and they formed the company Soleiko Ltée, to which the promoter assigned his rights (P-1B). The company immediately proceeded with the experiments undertaken by Archie Allain and soon after had an investment of some $170,000.00.
[6]
The mussel culture commenced with the collection of spats, gathered with the aid of a collector made with lines trailed along the seabed. The spats attached themselves to this during the summer months and were harvested around September 15, before the lagoon froze in November. They were then taken to a factory, removed from the lines by hand and collected in mesh sleeves before being returned to the sea and suspended from long lines in the lagoon, where they would grow to maturity. This is what is known as the long line method. Each 360-foot-long line is anchored at either end and laid in the direction of the width of the culture site. These lines are placed 50 feet from each other to allow fishermen's boats to move freely between them and the 4-foot-high sleeves are attached about 8 inches from each other. Each line has about 600 sleeves and this long line, drawn down toward the seabed as the mussels grow, is kept in place at the surface by the many buoys which are added as required so as to avoid sleeves with growing mussels being dragged to the bottom. Benefiting from experience acquired elsewhere, in particular in the State of Maine where 12-foot sleeves are used because culture sites are in deeper water, the Allain brothers used 4-foot sleeves as the water was about 10 feet deep at low tide at their site. This enabled them to lower their lines under the ice when the arrival of winter caused the lagoon to freeze. The long lines, progressively paid out from a number of buoys, settle slightly and the mussels can thus continue their growing under the ice. Around April 15, or as soon as the ice has melted, buoys are again installed to bring the lines to the surface. The collector lines lying on the seabed are ready to gather spats for the coming summer and the cycle thus repeats itself.
[7]
After various experiments, this long line method was adopted in preference to the float system. This involves 8-foot x 8-foot floats under which a number of collectors about 8 feet long are suspended. This method soon ceased being used, however, when it was realized that the mussels attached to the central collectors were less well fed and developed much less quickly than the others. This method ceased being used in 1982. Before finally opting for the method of long lines with green sleeves attached to them, an attempt was also made to use white sleeves similar to those used in Prince Edward Island. These are expanding sleeves which contain more mussels than the green sleeve - hoists have to be used to take them out of the water - but have the disadvantage of resulting in higher losses. Their unit cost is much less than the green sleeve, but use of the latter was preferred as at maturity it can produce about 210 mussels per linear foot.
[8]
Mussels are bivalve molluscs which feed on plankton floating in sea water and continually renewed by tidal movements. It goes without saying that they depend on the quality of their environment. Their structure allows them to filter sediment floating in water and retain only what they need for nutrition. When placed in a hostile environment, they may try to escape from places unsuited to their development or cease to feed.
[9]
Mussels usually come to maturity at the end of two years, after two winters spent under the ice. The plaintiff tried to market 16-month mussels about 1 1/2 inches in size, but the venture did not really succeed and it was instead decided to market only those about 28 months old and 2 1/2 to 3 inches long.
[10]
In 1983 and 1984 the progress of the plaintiff's mussel culture was very encouraging, under the supervision of biologists from the provincial Department of Fisheries, with the result that in spring 1985 there were approximately 23 lines of mussels 2 1/2 to 3 inches long, and so of marketable size, cultivated since summer 1983, 19 lines 1 1/2 to 2 inches long dating from 1984 and 18,000 seabed collectors to be harvested that fall. Everything was in place for a harvest of about 300,000 pounds of mussels. In short, the future seemed so bright that other studies were conducted and approaches made to the proper authorities with a view to building huge reservoirs fed by sea water so as to avoid having to winter the mussels under the ice. This would make them available at all seasons, even in winter, and they would be much more easily marketable.
Dredging at the Neguac Wharf
[11]
In fall 1984 the federal authorities decided to dredge the port of Neguac. The evidence showed that it had long been the habit of fishermen frequenting this port to use the area around the wharf as a refuse dump. Waste matter, batteries and in fact anything no longer needed when they returned from fishing was dumped beside the wharf. Funds were allocated to proceed with clearing the area around the wharf and the plan was that the material removed would be discharged near the wharf in a place protected by a barrier and used to build a parking lot. This area was large enough to contain all the dredging spoils in addition to gravel that would be brought from dry land. The dredging operation itself was to be done by the so-called suction method, but because of the unduly high cost involved, it was decided instead to use a backhoe and other pieces of equipment owned by the Department of Public Works. Dredging work began on May 6, 1985. As the barrier had not been completed and the site was still unable to receive the dredging spoils, the engineer in charge of operations decided to discharge the spoils into the lagoon, at a location previously authorized under a dumping permit issued by the Department of the Environment. We will return below to the circumstances surrounding issuance of the permits. Accordingly, as the barrier was not completed until May 31, 5,211 cubic metres of dredging spoils were discharged into the lagoon between May 5 and May 31. The waste material was thereafter discharged inside the jetty, but it was soon realized that this operation was much more difficult than discharge into the sea, with the result that when the funds authorized had been exhausted waste material was once again disposed of into the lagoon. This operation proceeded from July 22 to September 13, when 7,698 cubic metres of mud, silt and other dredging spoils were discharged, for a total quantity of 12,909 cubic metres. In fact, it was the action taken by the plaintiff around September 6 which halted these discharges and the work was completed by throwing the debris inside the jetty.
[12]
The precise location where the spoils were discharged into the lagoon is disputed. In theory, according to the geographical coordinates, the discharge site should have been slightly northwest of the site leased by the plaintiff. The first permit (No. 1658), valid from August 25, 1984 to August 24, 1985, authorized the discharge of 40,000 cubic metres of dredging spoils; however, it was not used before dredging operations began in May 1985. This permit contained no particular restriction, unlike others issued earlier, which contained restrictions for certain months of the year, during which for example lobster fishing was authorized. A second permit (No. 1807) extended the validity of the earlier permit for an additional year, from August 25, 1985 to August 24, 1986. Both these permits stated that the discharge was to be within a 100-metre radius of the buoy indicating the location of the discharge site.
[13]
In fact, the discharge location was not indicated by a steel buoy detectable on radar, simply by a white buoy made of plastic, about 2 feet in diameter.
[14]
The evidence did not disclose the method used to lay the buoy at the right place, namely 47 degrees 15.08 minutes north and 65 degrees 2.60 minutes west, but the captain of the barge discharging the spoils indicated that he had verified the discharge location using reference points on dry land: he said that the position seemed to be correct. However, he did not use either a sextant or loran to determine exactly where he was to discharge the waste. In fact, this witness and other witnesses heard for the plaintiff estimated that the discharges were further east, due north of the plaintiff's site, in line with its buoys situated on the west. The distance from the discharge point to the northern end of the plaintiff's site was estimated by the witnesses as varying from 1,000 to 1,800 feet. It would also seem that not much importance was placed on the precise location of the discharge, since when a witness wanted to photograph the barge as it was preparing to make the discharge, the witness was told not to do so and the barge went to make its discharge 200 or 300 feet further north.
[15]
The exact location of the discharge takes on special importance because of the influence of the currents, especially low tide, when as water withdraws from the lagoon it may carry sediment from the discharge site directly over the plaintiff's site. Fishermen who know Neguac Bay well estimated the force of the current in Portage Gully at about 5 knots, but at only one or two knots over the plaintiff's site.
[16]
The evidence was that when the lines were raised in spring 1985 the sleeves were more than usually filled with clusters of lovely black mussels, of good quality and uniform size. In May and June Archie Allain began noticing that the water was dirty and realized that the lifting of his collection lines, with the collectors trailing along the seabed, was a more difficult operation than in previous years. In July he found that his mussels seemed to be growing less rapidly than before and he consulted biologists who told him that slower growth of the mussels could be due to the warmer temperature of the water. In short, they reassured him. At the end of August, he noticed that the lines of sleeves were having problems and losing mussels, that the mussels had stopped growing and were even losing weight. He had occasion with other witnesses to follow the barge travelling back and forth between the Neguac wharf and the discharge site and noticed that the water was murky at this location as well as over his mussel culture site. In fact, he found a black, oily substance on his mussels. He informed Jean-André Blanchard, a biologist who had been following his experiments since 1981 and who contacted federal officials. In late August and early September federal officials from the Departments of Fisheries and Oceans and the Environment came to the site. They found that there were almost no spats on the collectors. In late October, 75% of the mussels were dead and the shells were opening. Experiments were even done with those which remained closed and seemed to be in good health: as soon as pressure was exerted to open them, it was found that a black and nauseating substance was emitted and that they were dead. The Department was held responsible and steps were taken to prepare the claim.
Defence
[17]
In a case such as this it is clear that the plaintiff has a duty to prove the loss of its mussels was due to the defendant's actions. As the results of water and mud analyses were not filed, it has to be concluded as counsel for the plaintiff did that there was no scientific proof that the loss of the mussels was due directly to the defendant's activities. The facts must therefore be weighed on a balance of probabilities.
[18]
The defendant called several witnesses in an effort first to establish that the plaintiff knew or should have known that dredging work would eventually take place near its mussel culture site. We will return to this later in considering the possibility of joint liability. The defence also devoted much effort to establishing the circumstances surrounding the issuing of the dumping permits, which must be observed before disposing of dredging spoils. Finally, it submitted that the losses sustained by the plaintiff were not as high as it maintained and it could have mitigated the consequences of such losses.
[19]
Let us consider first the facts surrounding the issuing of the dumping permits. The Ocean Dumping Control Act provides that dumping may only take place in accordance with a permit issued by the Minister on receipt of an application in the prescribed form. In determining whether to grant the permit, the Minister must take into account the various factors set out in Schedule III of the Act in the interests not only of human life but of marine life as well. To comply with the Act and issue the proper permits, the federal government has the services of the Regional Director, Environmental Protection, with Environment Canada, who is advised by a committee (the Regional Ocean Dumping Advisory Committee, "RODAC"). In the Atlantic Region this committee is headed by Allan McIver, and includes for the region in question Patrice Leblanc as head of the Fish Habitat and Enhancement Division and Francis Jordan, an oceanographer attached to the Bedford Institute in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Serge Metikosh acted as secretary. They all have staff working for them and are responsible for applying the Act.
[20]
Dumping permits have been regularly issued and renewed for dredging spoils from Lower Neguac and Neguac Church since 1978. However, they were not used before May 1983. At that time, using permit No. 1427, 15,622 cubic metres of waste material from Lower Neguac wharf were dumped. According to Archie Allain, this dumping took place before the long line culture began in fall 1983 and was done further west than those in 1985. Permit No. 1658 authorized receipt of dredging spoils from Neguac Church wharf without limitation from August 1984 to August 1985. It was not used. In February 1985, the Department of Public Works applied to renew and extend this permit for dredging work to be done between May 1985 and April 1986. This application was considered a "repeat operation" by secretary Metikosh and sent to the members of the Committee at once with the following comment (D-7):
"This is a repeat operation and meets the criteria for review under RODAC's prescreening guidelines. No problems are therefore anticipated and approval will be recommended unless you advise us within two weeks of any concerns you may have."
[21]
Mr. Leblanc imposed as a condition of renewal that the Department inform the "Area Conservation Chief, D.F.O., 48 hours prior to start of work" (see D-6, p. 15). The permit was renewed the following April 4.
[22]
It should be mentioned that when the members of the RODAC committee renewed dumping permit 1807 they were all, including the chairman and secretary of the Committee, unaware that the plaintiff was operating a mussel culture site about 1,800 feet from the dump site. This mussel culture site had, however, previously been authorized by the same Department, which gave the plaintiff a twenty-year lease in April 1982. Moreover, according to the organization chart of the permit review system, when a repeat application involves changes there must be a technical review and this requires a visit to the site. As changes were not mentioned, there was no technical review, and according to all the members of the committee who were heard, if they had been told that this mussel site was near the dumping site, the permit would undoubtedly not have been issued.
Expert Witnesses
[23]
The parties each called two expert witnesses in support of their respective arguments.
[24]
The defence first tried to show that it is unlikely that the discharge of dredging spoils could have caused as much damage as the plaintiff clearly indicated took place, because of the effect of the tide and winds, which they said essentially would not have been strong enough in Neguac Bay to lift sediment and carry it to the plaintiff's site. Gerald Siebert works with the Bedford Institute of Oceanography as a physical oceanographer. He made an analysis of the seabed in Neguac Bay using marine maps. However, he did not go to the site and his analysis is purely theoretical. He assumed for the purpose of his calculations that the discharge of waste material took place within a radius of 100 metres from the discharge site initially specified, located 570 metres (1,870 feet) from the plaintiff's site. In practice, however, the evidence showed that determination of the buoy location was done visually, without precision instruments, and that discharges could have been made at distances much closer to the plaintiff's site. The witness sought to show that the shallower the seabed, the less chance there is that floating particles left by a waste discharge will move from this precise location. He sought to show that the wind and the effect of the tides helped to move floating sediment. In analysing the waves he relied on winds recorded at Chatham, 35 kilometres from Neguac Bay, and concluded it was unlikely that these winds could have had the necessary velocity to move floating particles to the plaintiff's site. However, he admitted in cross-examination that sea winds could be some 2.3 times higher than those recorded on land, and that a 10-kilometre wind at Chatham could thus be 23 kilometers in Neguac Bay. His calculations also did not take into account currents due to the tide, though these could have a much greater impact on sedimentation than surface currents. He did not take these into account because he considered that in view of the discharge location the current created by the tide was parallel to the plaintiff's site and so could not affect it. The evidence showed, nevertheless, that the discharges took place approximately in a straight line with the western end of the mussel culture site and that at low tide floating particles moving towards Portage Gully were unavoidably taken in that direction.
[25]
The court concludes from this testimony that learned and complicated as this expert witness' calculations were, it is still possible and probable that the waste material disposed of could have been carried towards the plaintiff's site by the combined effect of waves and tides, even though at that point the sediment may have been so diluted that it was almost imperceptible. The fact remains, however, that the evidence given by several witnesses, including witnesses for the defendant, showed that oily substances and clouds of substances floating in the water were found at the plaintiff's site and, according to the evidence, originated at the dump site.
[26]
Another expert witness for the defence, Dr. André Mallet, is a specialist in marine biology. The witness testified at length on mussels and how they are grown. Very briefly summarized, his testimony was that mussels are highly resistant molluscs which adapt quite readily to changes in their environment. The defence tried to sow some doubt by suggesting that the disaster which occurred at the plaintiff's mussel culture site could be due to what is commonly known as a "summer kill phenomenon". This phenomenon, of massive mussel mortality during the summer, has been noted in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and was the subject of a study by Dr. Mallet, chiefly on the high mortality rates occurring in Prince Edward Island in 1986 and 1987. He obtained no information to show that such a phenomenon might have occurred in New Brunswick, and his report contained no data regarding Neguac Bay. He attributed this phenomenon to the combined effect of high water temperature for an extended period, low food supply levels and the poor physiological condition of the mussels, all factors usually met with during the summer. The witness was quite unable to say that this phenomenon had occurred in Neguac Bay in summer 1985. However, he admitted during a lengthy cross-examination that a sufficient quantity of turbidity in the water could cause the mussels to suffocate, to cease filtering and allow themselves to die of hunger. He further admitted that the discharge of dredging spoils could create turbidity and that the level could rise as high as 300 or 400 milligrams per litre, while problems will usually occur anywhere above 150 milligrams per litre. He did not rule out the possibility that mussels exposed to such a concentration for several weeks could die of it.
[27]
The defence also sought through this witness to discredit the allegedly unorthodox method used by the plaintiff to attach its mussel sleeves to the cables at a distance it said was too close. According to the expert witness, it is not advisable to have the sleeves only about 8 inches apart. In practice he preferred to have them kept apart to avoid contact between the sleeves and "second set", a phenomenon in which spats tend to attach themselves to adult mussels. In fact, however, there was nothing in the evidence to show that there had been contact between the sleeves or that the "second set" phenomenon had occurred on the plaintiff's site.
[28]
The plaintiff, for its part, first called Dr. George D. Bacon, an expert in marine ecology. In his report (B-7) of December 19, 1985, the witness had concluded that the loss of the mussels could have been due to physical rather than chemical factors, or perhaps even to a combination of the two. After hearing the plaintiff's evidence and the admission of counsel that he was not disputing that chemical analyses could not link the destruction of the mussels to the dredging activities, the witness stated that in light of information obtained since he prepared his report he would alter it so as to attribute destruction of the mussels entirely to the physical impact of the ambient environment, that is, the presence of sediment in the water. The witness gave a lengthy explanation of the mussel feeding system and the impact of too great a quantity of sediment in the water, which may lead them to cease feeding or simply to look for another location. He said that it is not just a coincidence that the mussels died when dredging spoils were being discharged near the culture site, and that their death was actually due to the presence of too great a quantity of sediment in the water. He saw a direct positive correlation between the discharges and mussel mortality. He rejected the possibility that massive summer mortality of mussels could have occurred in Neguac Bay in 1985 and saw no comparison with the conditions which produced this phenomenon in Prince Edward Island, among other places. He said he had a high opinion of this business cultivating mussels in Neguac Bay in 1985: at the time it "was the flagship of the New Brunswick mussel industry". This is why the proposal to build large reservoirs to ensure the marketing of mussels in wintertime was favoured. In short, he found it inconceivable and incomprehensible for any-one to take the risk of discharging waste material anywhere in the lagoon, because of the tide, the currents and the particularly fragile marine equilibrium, at such a place; and according to the witness, if it could not have been disposed of as originally planned, the waste material should instead have been thrown into the sea, where there was a dump site not far away, outside the lagoon.
[29]
The plaintiff's second expert witness, Dr. Martin L.H. Thomas, is a specialist in marine biology. He is a professor of biology at the University of New Brunswick and is particularly interested in the correlation between sedimentology and biology. He is very familiar with Neguac Bay, where he has had occasion to conduct several studies, and his report was based on his personal observations of this estuary. The witness gave a lengthy but clear and straightforward explanation of the fragility of an estuary where the sedimentary pattern may be strongly affected by the presence of a dump site. The redistribution of sediment is particularly affected by water movements caused by tides, waves and the frequent passage of a barge near a mussel culture site. The witness explained the combined effect of the low tide and winds in Neguac Bay, at least twice as great as those recorded at Chatham, which may have taken the sediment from the discharge location to the plaintiff's site. He saw the presence of a thin layer of oil on the mussels as an indication that dredging spoils had been transferred from the discharge location to the plaintiff's site. In discussing the mussel feeding system the witness explained how they seek their food from particles floating in the water by filtering sediment. They assume that a majority of the particles that they absorb will contain edible food but do not distinguish between sedimentary particles resulting from deflocculation and nutritive particles which contain inter alia the plankton necessary for their survival. The mussels absorb all fine particles without knowing whether they are sediment or organic matter, but their digestive system functions to reject what is not desirable. As such, a slight increase in sediment in the water may reduce their feeding capacity, while a large increase in sediment will cause them to stop feeding. In his opinion, it can be concluded from the facts presented in the plaintiff's evidence that the loss of its mussels is connected with the dredging operations and the discharge taking place near the mussel culture site.
[30]
The court has no hesitation in concluding from all the facts presented in evidence that the loss of the mussels resulted from the discharge near the plaintiff's site of spoils from dredging at the Neguac wharf. The court rejects the argument made by the defence regarding the possibility that summer 1985 saw the occurrence of the massive mortality phenomenon noted in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia in subsequent years. The court further concludes that the method used by the plaintiff to raise its mussels was suited to the seabed where it was operating its industry and that the arguments put forward by the defence in this connection, as to an improper use of the long line method, were unsupported in fact.
Liability
[31]
It remains to be seen whether in law these facts constitute a nuisance for which the defendant can be held liable, or negligence in the taking of necessary precautions to avoid contamination and in issuing the permit to dump waste material. Finally, the court must see whether the parties should be held jointly liable.
[32]
In support of its action the plaintiff alleged, first, the concept of nuisance found at common law, and in particular nuisance to the rights of riparian owners. In more general terms, it alleged a breach of the law governing neighbouring occupancy.
[33]
The common law rule was first stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  brings on his land, and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it in at his peril, and, if he does not do so, he is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. He can excuse himself by showing that the escape was owing to the plaintiff's default, or, perhaps, that the escape was the consequence of vis major, or the act of God; but, as nothing of this sort exists here, it is unnecessary to inquire what excuse would be sufficient. The general rule, as above stated, seems on principle just."
[34]
Canadian law on the point is similar to English law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and 94 A.P.R. 288), in which construction work on a sports centre owned by the municipality caused flooding on an adjoining property, the court found that the plaintiff did not show that the 1976 flooding was caused by the city's negligence in installing or maintaining the water main, but it agreed that the city had not presented any evidence to explain the break in the water main which caused the flooding and so to shift the burden of proof on it to show that the break in the main was the inevitable consequence of expanding and using the water system. Relying on several cases such as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C.A.), the court found that a nuisance giving rise to an action for damages had been established and that the defence based on the power conferred by the Act could not be upheld. The New Brunswick Court of Appeal then approved the concept of nuisance stated by McIntyre, J., later of the Supreme Court of Canada, and summarized as follows in the Royal Anne Hotel headnote:
"The essence of the tort of nuisance is interference with the enjoyment of land. That interference need not be accompanied by negligence. In nuisance one is concerned with the invasion of the interest in the land, in negligence one must consider the nature of the conduct complained of. Nuisances result frequently from intentional acts undertaken for lawful purposes. The most carefully designed industrial plant operated with the greatest care may well be or cause a nuisance if, for example, effluent, smoke, fumes or noise invade the right of enjoyment of neighbouring landowners to an unreasonable degree. The test is, has the defendant's use of his land interfered with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff's land and is that interference unreasonable? Where actual physical damage occurs it is not difficult to decide that the interference is unreasonable. Greater difficulty will be found where the interference results in lesser or no physical injury but may give offence by reason of smells, noise, vibration or other intangible causes. No finding is required regarding the exercise of care by the defendant and while its conduct may frequently be such that a finding of negligence could be made it is not necessary and the existence of due care will afford no defence if the other ingredients are present. The rationale for the law of nuisance in modern times is the provision of a means of reconciling certain conflicting interests in connection with the use of land, even where the conflict does not result from negligent conduct. Nuisance protects against the unreasonable invasion of interests in land."
[35]
As can be seen from reading this passage, nuisance which invades the rights of a neighbour may but does not necessarily have to be accompanied by negligence. In fact, it does not have to be taken into account in considering this question raised by counsel for the plaintiff.
[36]
This concept has been applied by the courts on many occasions, chiefly in situations where the owner of land invades the rights of a riparian owner. Thus, in Nepisiquit Real Estate and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it was held that the riparian owner had a right to benefit from the natural current in the river without its being lessened or polluted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 4 N.R. 231, at 511 S.C.R., Pigeon, J., of the Supreme Court expressed the following opinion about  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  damages against the owner of a polluting factory:
"In my view, that judgment is authority for the proposition that, at common law, pollution of waters to an injurious degree is a tort that gives rise to a cause of action for those whose property rights are affected thereby."
[37]
In the submission of counsel for the defendant, however, the application of the theory of nuisance to riparian owners cannot be applied in the instant case because we are not dealing with the owners of land crossed by a stream or river, but with waste material thrown into the sea. He argued that the plaintiff in fact has only a tenant's right and that its lease at most gives it permission to anchor its cables and put them in the water. In short, he said, it has no ownership right, only permission to be in the lagoon.
[38]
I do not share that view. It seems clear from the lease given by the federal Department of Fisheries that it was made for the purpose of raising oysters and other molluscs, and that the sector covered by the lease would only be used for that purpose. In my opinion this concept of nuisance in the law governing neighbouring occupancy applies not only to a riparian owner or someone who has an ownership right, but to wrongful relations between neighbours, whether simply tenants or, as here, beneficiaries of the right to engage in "the raising of oysters or other molluscs".
[39]
A defendant who seeks to justify or to limit his liability for a nuisance often tends to rely on the defence of a power conferred by law, or in other words, administrative authorization. Counsel for the plaintiff dealt with this point at length, believing that this would be his opponent's principal avenue of defence. The latter did not elaborate on this point in his pleading, however, though most of his defence witnesses were called to show that the dredging spoils were deposited in the lagoon under a valid permit, and hence with administrative authorization. I do not think it is useful to develop this point as the evidence presented by the defendant herself, by calling members of the RODAC committee, in fact showed that if they had known of the existence of the plaintiff's site they would not have granted the permit. Moreover, even if the defence claimed it had a right to discharge its waste material at this location under the Ocean Dumping Control Act, it still did not have a right to do so regardless of the rights of the plaintiff. As to this, the Supreme Court held in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
"The appellant was given the power to construct a sewage lagoon but it was not subject to a specific mandate to do so irrespective of whether a nuisance was thereby created or not."
Furthermore, even if it had been able to do so, it could have got rid of its waste in another available site outside the lagoon.
[40]
The court concludes that the discharge of dredging spoils, dangerous per se (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), close to the plaintiff's site for an extended period, was an abuse of right and a nuisance to the rights of the plaintiff, which was raising mussels at that location.
[41]
The plaintiff further alleged that by failing to follow the system for granting and renewing sea dumping permits which she had herself established, the defendant failed in her duty of care and must accordingly be held liable for the damage caused to the plaintiff. It based this argument on the House of Lords decision in Anns and others v. London Borough of Merton, [1977] 2 All E.R. 492, and the judgment of the Supreme Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . I am far from thinking that these cases can apply to the case at bar, and do not intend to express any opinion on the matter.
[42]
Counsel for the plaintiff further argued that the defendant did not comply with the Ocean Dumping Control Act, and in particular s. 10, which requires the Minister, on receipt of an application, to take into account the factors set out in Schedule III of the Act in determining whether to grant the permit. The English wording, more precise than the French, makes this a duty by use of the expression "shall take into account the factors set out in Schedule III".
[43]
Schedule III lists several factors which the Minister must take into account in issuing permits. First, he must consider the "Characteristics and Composition of [the] Substance", including:
"(8) Probability of production of taints or other changes reducing marketability of resources (fish and shellfish)."
He must also consider the "Characteristics of [the] Dumping Site and Method of Deposit", including:
"(1) Location (e.g. co-ordinates of the dumping site, depth and distance from the coast) and location in relation to other areas (e.g. amenity areas, spawning, nursery and fishing areas and exploitable resources).
...
"(5) Dispersal characteristics (e.g. effects of currents, tides and wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing)."
[44]
Finally, he must consider the following "General Considerations and Conditions":
"(1) Possible effects on amenities (e.g. presence of floating or stranded material, turbidity, objectionable odour, discoloration and foaming).
"(2) Possible effects on marine life, fish and shellfish culture, fish stocks and fisheries, seaweed harvesting and culture.
"(3) Possible effects on other uses of the sea (e.g. impairment of water quality for industrial use, underwater corrosion of structures, interference with ship operations from floating substances, interference with fishing or navigation through deposit of waste or solid objects on the sea floor and protection of areas of special importance for scientific or conservation purposes).
"(4) The practical availability of alternative land based methods of treatment, disposal or elimination, or of treatment to render the matter less harmful for dumping at sea."
[45]
In this regard I need hardly say that the evidence clearly showed that the members of the RODAC committee responsible for advising the Minister not only did not take these points into account but, when examined, admitted that if they had known of the existence of the plaintiff's mussel culture site in this area they would never have authorized the permit.
[46]
The court concludes that the defendant must be held liable for the damage caused to the plaintiff. Should the liability be joint, as counsel for the plaintiff alleged, citing in support of this argument the Contributory Negligence Act (R.S.N.B. 1973, c. C-19)? In fact, he submitted that the plaintiff should bear part of the liability because it was told in 1983 that dredging spoils might be discharged near its site and because it did not object and did not warn the authorities in 1985 as soon as it found turbidity in the water on its site. I do not see in these facts any reason to blame the plaintiff. The warning given by an employee of the defendant in 1983 could not have relieved the latter of her duty not to cause damage to another, and this fact cannot in any way be used as a basis for a finding of fault by the plaintiff. As to the delay in making the problem known when it was discovered, this fact cannot be regarded as the immediate cause of the damage and does not have to be taken into account in determining whether there should be joint liability. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .)
Damages
[47]
It remains to determine the amount of the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled.
[48]
It claimed the sum of $366,500.00 for loss of its mussels, plus general damages, interest and costs. The amount claimed apparently corresponds to the loss of all the mussels floating in the water, as well as spats attached to the seabed collectors.
[49]
In such an action for damages, the plaintiff has a duty to establish the extent of the damage caused by the fault of the defendant and to satisfy the court, if the evidence shows that the loss is not a total one, that it took reasonable measures to minimize its loss ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of the growing mussels had been irreparably lost. The shells were opened or the mussels had simply dropped off the sleeves to which they had been attached. The loss on the collector lines dragged along the seabed to collect spats was 100%. Of the various quantities of mussels still hanging on the sleeves, the uncontradicted evidence was that the plaintiff tried the experiment of boiling some of them to determine their quality. The experiment was a disaster: the water was black, it gave off nauseating odors and they were not edible. It was concluded from this that not only was it economically not worth collecting the small quantities that remained but also that it might be dangerous to put them on the market and this could pose a threat to the industry. The defendant sent down divers in spring 1986 to assess the extent of the damage. They did notice that at the eastern ends of the lines, the area furthest from the discharge site, there were some mussels apparently in good condition, but this evidence is insufficient to show that it would have been economically feasible for the plaintiff to try and recover them. The court concludes that no recovery was possible and that the damage must be determined as if it were a total loss.
[51]
For mussels growing since 1983 the plaintiff claimed the equivalent of 23 lines of 600 sleeves each, each sleeve weighing an average of 15 pounds, making a total of 207,000 pounds of mussels. For the 1984 mussels it claimed the equivalent of 19 lines corresponding to 171,000 pounds. For 1985 spats it calculated 22 lines, amounting to 198,000 pounds. In the plaintiff's submission, this total inventory of 576,000 pounds could have been sold for 75 cents a pound, which would place its loss at $432,000.00 from which it deducted $65,500.00 for production costs not incurred, leaving a net loss of $366,500.00. Some of the figures put forward by the plaintiff were challenged by the defendant. Thus, on the one hand the defendant challenged the length of the lines, which would directly affect the number of sleeves per line and the marketable value of the mussels. On the other hand, the plaintiff's witnesses themselves were not unanimous as to the number of collector lines, one of the Allain brothers faulting the other for being too conservative in his figures.
[52]
The court realizes the difficulty faced by the plaintiff in making out its claim: it must take into account the size of the mussels depending on the stage of their growth and the price per pound that it could hope to obtain for them. Thus, it appeared that each sleeve of mussels growing since 1983 and 1984 might weight between 20 and 25 pounds, while others containing younger mussels necessarily weighed less, some 15 to 18 pounds. Additionally, sleeves of spats might weigh about 3 pounds. For the purpose of its calculations the plaintiff estimated that each sleeve would weigh 15 pounds on average.
[53]
After analysing the evidence at length the court concludes that the lines measured approximately 360 feet and contained an average of 540 sleeves each. The spat collectors might perhaps have given 28 lines instead of 22 as stated by two different witnesses for the plaintiff, one faulting the other for being too conservative, but the court prefers to take the lower figure, indicating 22 lines of spats in 1985.
[54]
The plaintiff calculated that it could sell its mussels at 75 cents a pound. This price seems very reasonable, based on 1984 figures and customer surveys. Moreover a witness for the defendant, Dr. Mallet, well acquainted with the mussel market, said that some producers were selling them for 90 cents to $1.00 a pound. The court accordingly accepts the average price of 75 cents a pound for mussels growing since 1983 and 1984.
[55]
The loss of the spats presents a special difficulty. They could not be harvested and would undoubtedly have represented a significant value for the plaintiff. The fact remains that they had not at the time been handled in any way and the evidence for the defence showed that Dr. Mallet bought spats for 10 cents a pound in 1985. It must certainly be taken into account that spats are more valuable to a producer who has the necessary infrastructure to cultivate them as opposed to a person buying them for experimental or other purposes. In short, while the suggested price of 10 cents a pound for spats does not seem realistic, the price claimed of 75 cents equally does not appear to correspond to reality. I think that in the circumstances a value of 40 cents a pound is reasonable.
[56]
The plaintiff is thus entitled to the following amounts.
1983 mussels
207,000 pounds x 75 cents =
$155,250.00
1984 mussels
171,000 pounds X 75 cents =
$128,250.00
1985 spats
198,000 pounds X 40 cents =
$79,200.00
-
-
$362,700.00
Less production costs not incurred
-
$65,500.00
-
-
$297,200.00
[57]
The plaintiff claimed general damages, left in the discretion of the court, to penalize the defendant for her uncaring attitude towards the plaintiff and for continuing to discharge waste even after she had been informed of the damage being caused to the plaintiff. The court does not consider that the facts and the evidence justify such a request.
[58]
There remains the question of interest before and after judgment.
[59]
The plaintiff claimed interest before judgment at the basic National Bank of Canada rate plus 1% from the date of its action, namely January 27, 1986.
[60]
In principle, the court cannot order the Crown to pay interest "in the absence of any contract stipulating for payment of such interest or of a statute providing in such a case for the payment of interest by the Crown". This is s. 35 of the Federal Court Act. Section 40, however, provides that a judgment against the Crown bears interest at the rate prescribed by s. 3 of the Interest Act, "unless otherwise ordered by the court".
[61]
Counsel for the defence did not object to this application, except as to the rate claimed.
[62]
In actual fact, the reasoning on which the court may order the Crown to pay interest before judgment is quite straightforward. This question has been the subject of judgments by both the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) and by this court ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in tort for the damages for which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be liable
(a) in respect of a tort committed by a servant of the Crown, or
(b) in respect of a breach of duty attaching to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property."
[63]
Additionally, in New Brunswick, s. 45 of the Judicature Act provides that:
"45(1) In any proceedings for the recovery of any debt or damages, the court may order that there shall be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest on the whole or any part of the debt or damages for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of judgment."
[64]
I feel it is appropriate to order the defendant to pay interest in the case at bar. To determine the rate and the date from which interest must be calculated, the court refers to the rules laid down by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 103 A.P.R. 361, at 380, where Richard, J.A., said:
"In the case of special damages, in tort action, it will depend on when the debts have been incurred or will be incurred if they are in the category of future ascertainable expenses. Thus the rule that, generally speaking, interest should be applied to their total sum at half the applicable rate from the date of the accident to the date of judgment is a sound compromise. It is not a rule that will yield a perfect mathematical result but one that is designed to be practical."
[65]
As the evidence disclosed (B1-0) that the basic rate in effect at the National Bank of Canada at the time the damage was caused, namely summer 1985, fluctuated around 10%, it seems fair and reasonable in the circumstances to award the plaintiff interest corresponding to half this rate, or 5% from the approximate date at which it incurred its loss, namely October 1, 1985.
[66]
The plaintiff shall be entitled to all its costs, including expert witness fees.
Judgment for plaintiff.
