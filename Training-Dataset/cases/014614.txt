Summary
[1]
Brown, J.
: This is an application for judicial review by Anne Waithera Mwaura [the Applicant] under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Refugee Appeal Division [RAD], dated October 8, 2014, wherein the RAD confirmed the determination by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and dismissed her appeal. The application is granted because the RAD acted unreasonably in requiring such applicants to file a psychological report in order to claim the "compelling reasons" exception under subsection 108(4) of the IRPA.
II.
Facts
[2]
The Applicant was born on August 20, 1965. She is a citizen of Kenya. The Applicant claimed refugee protection in Canada, alleging fear of the Mungiki organization for refusing to join them and take over her mother's role as a circumciser of females in the country. The Applicant, in April 2008 while in her early forties, was forcibly circumcised by her mother with the assistance of others, including family members. Her mother performed such Female Genital Mutilation [FGM] for the Mungiki organization, a criminal gang in Kenya. The Applicant fled Kenya because the gang wanted her to take over her mother's role as their circumciser. The Applicant fears that the Mungiki gang will force her to circumcise her own daughter, although the gang's activity appears to have been reduced since her departure. The RPD found that the Applicant failed to rebut the presumption of state protection and rejected her claim for refugee protection on May 27, 2014.
[3]
The RPD, despite it having been argued, neither considered nor decided the Applicant's claim for protection under the "compelling reasons" exception pursuant to subsection 108(4) of the IRPA.
[4]
The Applicant appealed to the RAD where she raised the "compelling reasons" exception in subsection 108(4), and argued that the RPD erred in its state protection finding. She did not file new evidence. The RAD dismissed the Applicant's appeal on October 8, 2014. This Court granted the Applicant leave to seek judicial review on March 30, 2015.
III.
Decision under Review
[5]
Regarding its role on appeal, the RAD surveyed this Court's jurisprudence. It determined that the case law requires it to review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of the Applicant's refugee claim, deferring to the RPD only where the latter enjoyed a particular advantage over the RAD in reaching a conclusion.
[6]
The Applicant had argued before the RPD that FGM is an atrocious and appalling treatment. She argued that being subjected to FGM is a "compelling reason" that triggers subsection 108(4) of the IRPA. Subsection 108(4) is an exception to the general rule set out in section 108(1)(e), which requires a refugee claim to be rejected where the reasons for claiming protection have ceased to exist.
[7]
As noted, the RPD ignored this line of argument. On appeal, the RAD found that the RPD's failure to consider the Applicant's "compelling reasons" argument was an error. However, the RAD held this error was not determinative because it was required to conduct an independent assessment of the evidence and reach its own conclusion on the "compelling reasons" exception.
[8]
Of great importance to this application, and in terms of the evidence required to establish a claim of "compelling reasons", the RAD found that:
[38] ... In order for the RPD (and, in this case, the RAD) to assess whether the exception applies, it must consider the emotional and psychological impact of the Appellant's return to her country.
Neither Division has the expertise to determine, absent a psychological report, the psychological health and strength of the Appellant or the degree of emotional trauma she would experience upon return.
[emphasis added]
[9]
The RAD in effect found the Applicant had not provided sufficient evidence to establish she is among the tiny minority of refugee claimants to whom this exception applied. In light of the above, the RAD confirmed the RPD's decision that the Applicant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and dismissed her appeal.
[10]
Before this Court, the Applicant raised other issues concerning state protection and the review of country documents, which are not discussed further given my conclusion in this case.
IV.
Issue
[11]
The determinative issue is whether the RAD erred or acted unreasonably in requiring a psychological report from the Applicant, and more generally, from all those claiming the "compelling reasons" exception under subsection 108(4) of the IRPA.
V.
Standard of review
[12]
The standard of review applicable to a RAD decision is an unsettled question of law. However the question of whether the RAD erred in requiring all refugee claimants to file a psychological report to succeed under subsection 108(4) of the IRPA is a question of mixed fact and law reviewable on the standard of reasonableness. In addition, to the extent this is an issue of the RAD interpreting its home statute, given the extensive jurisprudence concerning subsection 108(4), the RAD will act unreasonably if it departs from settled jurisprudence: see the reasons of the Chief Justice in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . However, I recognize that the test for "compelling reasons" per subsection 108(4) could by analogy be reviewed on a standard of correctness: see the reasons of the Chief Justice in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . I do not need to decide the applicable standard of review because the RAD's decision is both unreasonable and incorrect.
VI.
Analysis
[13]
In my respectful view, the RAD came to an unreasonable and incorrect conclusion in stating that neither division, i.e., neither the RPD nor the RAD, have the expertise to determine, "absent a psychological report", the psychological health and strength of the Applicant or the degree of emotional trauma she would experience upon returning to Kenya.
[14]
In my view, this statement is likely intended to apply more generally, and not only to the RAD itself but also to the RPD. Therefore it could have the effect of requiring a psychological report from all those claiming the "compelling reasons" exception under subsection 108(4). In my view, this would constitute an incorrect and unreasonable approach to the interpretation of the subsection.
[15]
I have reached this conclusion for several reasons. First, this requirement is contrary to well-established jurisprudence of this Court; therefore it is unreasonable and incorrect in that it is not defensible in respect of the "law" as required by <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47. Second, it unreasonably fetters the discretion of the relevant decision-makers; for that reason also, the establishment of this new requirement is unreasonable. Third, to require a psychological report unreasonably imposes too high a burden on refugee claimants seeking protections by international convention and by Canadian legislation. It imports into the statutory scheme a legal requirement not provided for in the legislation nor in the regulations; therefore it is unreasonable. It will also tend to create an incomplete and inadequate analytical paradigm. In my respectful view, this entirely novel approach should be rejected. I expand on these points in the following.
[16]
The genesis and purpose of the "compelling reasons" exception was recently outlined by the Chief Justice in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], in which the Court noted that the "compelling reasons" exception is limited to where there is
prima facie
evidence of past persecution that is so exceptional in its severity as to rise to the level of "appalling" or "atrocious". Further, the exception is well-entrenched, dating back at least to the post-war refugee convention of 1951. It is noteworthy that the review in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> makes no reference to a limitation on subsection 108(4) of the IRPA such as to require psychological harm or to a requirement to file a psychological report to succeed.
[17]
This Court has rejected the proposition that a precondition to a successful "compelling reasons" claim is psychological harm.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] the Court stated:
[26] I agree with the Board that the evidence of continuing psychological after-[e] ffects is relevant to a determination of the issue,
but is not a separate test that has to be met
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) (QL) at paragraphs 32-34). Therefore, it is not because a claimant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder that the "compelling reasons" exception will automatically apply.
The Board must decide each case based on the totality of the evidence.
[emphasis added]
[18]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] the Court said there was no further test of continuing psychological after-effects, which again impliedly rejects the need for psychological reports:
[20] That being said, this Court has already recognized that past acts of torture and extreme forms of mental abuse, alone, in view of their gravity and seriousness, can be considered "compelling reasons" for giving Refugee status to a claimant and the members of his immediate family despite the fact that these acts have occurred many years before. This should come as no surprise since the right not to be subject to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is a fundamental right equally protected under domestic and international law which Canada is committed to guarantee and promote. Moreover,
while the case law does not impose "a further test of continuing psychological after-effect[s]
", the failure of the Tribunal to take account of relevant medical evidence in this regard constitutes a reviewable error.
[footnotes omitted; emphasis added]
[19]
This Court stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 34 (FC) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]:
[34]
I do not think any of the jurisprudence raised suggests a further test of continuing psychological after-effects
. I discern no contradictions in the jurisprudence. I fear counsel have put emphasis on
obiter
and not on the
ratio decidendi
.
[emphasis added]
Again, I take these reasons to reject what is now proposed, namely mandatory filing of psychological reports under subsection 108(4).
[20]
From these cases, it is clear to me that there is no requirement to establish psychological health and strength, or the degree of emotional trauma. Likewise, there is no requirement to establish psychological after-effects. Because there is no requirement to establish psychological after-effects, the absence of psychological evidence logically and legally cannot be fatal to a "compelling reasons" claim.
[21]
It should be noted that these cases predate the establishment of the RAD.
[22]
In the absence of a legislative requirement, in my view and with respect, it was not open to the RAD to alter this law recognized by this Court. To allow the RAD to do so allows it to unreasonably exercise its new powers. In this connection, it should be remembered that the definition of reasonableness provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47 includes a legal component: reasonableness "is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts
and law
[emphasis added] ". I conclude that the RAD's decision is outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the subsection enacted by Parliament, as it has consistently been construed and applied by this Court.
[23]
The RAD's change in the legal requirements for the "compelling reasons" exception is also flawed because it fetters the discretion of the decision-maker. This exception is one rooted in international convention. As noted by the Chief Justice in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 34, and as stated in the
UN Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees
, this exception "reflects a more general humanitarian principle, which could also be applied to refugees other than statutory refugees". It appears to me that these international agreements and resulting legislation were calculated to be more inclusive, not less so, and to reflect a more general humanitarian principle. They are not designed to initiate a narrow search for psychological harm. Requiring a psychological report in all cases could defeat this purpose, as seen from the cases above.
[24]
A related difficulty with requiring a psychological report is that it elevates the burden on refugee claimants, thereby weakening (by a tribunal-made evidentiary ruling) the very protections Parliament intended the tribunal to consider and apply. Nothing suggests the RPD, its predecessors or this Court experienced difficulty in applying the already rigorous and narrow requirements enveloping the "compelling reasons" exception.
[25]
I am also concerned that demanding a psychological report may and perhaps will have the likely effect of transforming what is intended and expressed to be a general humanitarian availability, i.e., one where there are "compelling reasons", into a new paradigm; I am particularly concerned this new paradigm will be less-nuanced and simplified into an inquiry into what psychologists might have to say. A further danger is that if the psychologists say nothing, no relief will be forthcoming. This is going unreasonably far because there may be persons fully entitled to the "compelling reasons" exception, who are fully justified in not being repatriated, but for whom a psychological test would be irrelevant. Setting up a new restrictive evidentiary requirement, in my respectful opinion, is not reasonable or correct.
[26]
While I agree that "compelling reasons" may in some, many and even in most cases, entail psychological considerations, the following oft-cited passage from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 19 makes it clear that much more is involved:
[19] The degree, to which a refugee claimant lives his anguish upon thought of being forced to return from where he came, is subject to the state of his psychological health (strength). The formulative question to ask in regard to "compelling reasons" is, should the claimant be made to face the background set of life which he or she left, even if the principal characters may no longer be present or no longer be playing the same roles?
The answer lies not so much in established determinative conclusive fact but rather more to the extent of travail of the inner self or soul to which the claimant would be subjugated
. The decision, as all decisions of a compelling nature, necessitates the view that it is the state of mind of the refugee claimant that creates the precedent - not necessarily the country, the conditions, nor the attitude of the population, even though those factors may come into balance. Moreover, this judgment does not involve the imposition of Western concepts on a subtle phenomenon which roots in the individuality of human nature, an individuality which is unique and has grown in an all-together different social and cultural environment. Therefore, consideration should also be given to the claimant's age, cultural background and previous social experiences.
Being resilient to adverse conditions will depend of a number of factors which differ from one individual to another
.
[emphasis added]
[27]
The Respondent argued that
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] required a psychological report. With respect I disagree. Nowhere does <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> state that a psychological report is required. Obviously such report could and will likely assist a refugee claimant in many cases, but <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> neither sets out to, nor does it overrule law already established by <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[28]
In my view, the decision is flawed by the RAD's insistence on the filing of a psychological report because that requirement does not fall within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law per <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[29]
The Respondent argued in the alternative that the evidence in this case does not support a finding of "compelling reasons", emphasizing that the onus is on the Applicant to establish "compelling reasons". I agree the onus is on the Applicant; however, the onus cannot be determinative when the decision-maker unreasonably self-instructs on the relevant evidentiary burden, as occurred here. Whether or not that burden is met is for the RAD to decide on the re-determination ordered in this case.
[30]
The Respondent's argument on the evidence is a variant of the futility doctrine, according to which a reviewing Court may refuse to grant judicial review notwithstanding reviewable error where it is satisfied a breach of procedural fairness could not have affected the decision:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[31]
Here, the RAD's imposition of an unreasonable and incorrect evidentiary requirement on itself could have affected the result. It is unsafe to allow the decision to stand, therefore it must be and is set aside.
[32]
Given these findings, it is not necessary to examine the issue of state protection.
[33]
Neither party requested the certification of a question, and none arises.
VII.
Conclusion
[34]
The application for judicial review is granted.
JUDGMENT
[35]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is granted, the decision is set aside, the matter is remitted to a differently constituted panel of the RAD for re-determination, no question is certified and there is no order as to costs.

[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par Anne Waithera Mwaura (la demanderesse) au titre du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (LIPR), concernant la décision, datée du 8 octobre 2014, par laquelle la Section d'appel des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada (la SAR) a confirmé la décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR), qui avait jugé que la demanderesse n'avait pas qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger, et a rejeté son appel. La demande est accueillie parce que la SAR a agi de manière déraisonnable en exigeant de la demanderesse la production d'un rapport psychologique pour invoquer l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » prévue au paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR.
II.
Faits
[2]
La demanderesse est née le 20 août 1965. Elle est citoyenne du Kenya. Elle a demandé l'asile au Canada, en alléguant craindre l'organisation des Mungikis parce qu'elle avait refusé d'en faire partie et de reprendre le rôle de sa mère comme exciseuse dans son pays. La demanderesse, en avril 2008, qui était alors au début de la quarantaine, a été circoncise de force par sa mère avec l'aide d'autres personnes, y compris des membres de sa famille. Sa mère effectuait pareilles mutilations génitales féminines (MGF) pour l'organisation des Mungikis, un gang criminel au Kenya. La demanderesse a fui le Kenya parce que le gang voulait qu'elle reprenne le rôle de sa mère en tant qu'exciseuse. Elle craint que les Mungikis la forcent à circoncire sa propre fille, même si l'organisation semble avoir réduit ses activités depuis son départ. Le SPR a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État et a rejeté sa demande d'asile le 27 mai 2014.
[3]
La SPR, bien qu'il en ait été discuté, n'a ni examiné ni tranché la demande d'asile de la demanderesse en tenant compte de l'exception des « raisons impérieuses », prévue au paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR.
[4]
La demanderesse en a appelé à la SAR où elle a soulevé l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » au paragraphe 108(4) et allégué que la SAR a commis une erreur dans sa conclusion concernant la protection de l'État. Elle n'a produit aucune nouvelle preuve. La SAR a rejeté l'appel de la demanderesse le 8 octobre 2014. La Cour a autorisé le contrôle judiciaire le 30 mars 2015.
III.
Décision visée par le contrôle
[5]
En ce qui a trait à la question de son rôle en appel, la SAR a examiné la jurisprudence de la Cour. Elle a établi que la jurisprudence exigeait qu'elle examine tous les aspects de la décision de la SPR pour parvenir à une évaluation indépendante de la demande d'asile, en faisant preuve de retenue à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR seulement si celle-ci bénéficiait d'un avantage particulier pour les tirer.
[6]
La demanderesse avait fait valoir devant la SPR que les MGF constituent un traitement atroce et effroyable. Elle a avancé que le fait de subir des MGF constitue une « raison impérieuse » qui déclenche l'application du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR. Le paragraphe 108(4) est une exception à la règle générale énoncée à l'alinéa 108(1)
e
), qui prescrit le rejet de la demande d'asile lorsque les raisons justifiant la demande n'existent plus.
[7]
Comme je l'ai mentionné, la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de ce type d'argument. En appel, la SAR a conclu que le défaut de la SPR de tenir compte de l'argument des « raisons impérieuses » était une erreur. Toutefois, la SAR a jugé que cette erreur n'était pas déterminante, parce qu'elle était tenue de procéder à une évaluation indépendante de la preuve et de tirer sa propre conclusion sur l'exception des « raisons impérieuses ».
[8]
En ce qui a trait à la preuve requise pour établir une demande d'asile pour des « raisons impérieuses », question qui revêt beaucoup d'importance dans la présente demande, la SAR a conclu ce qui suit:
[38] [...] Pour déterminer si l'exception s'applique, la SPR (et, dans la présente affaire, la SAR) doit tenir compte des répercussions affectives et psychologiques que causerait le retour de l'appelante dans son pays d'origine. Aucune des deux sections n'a l'expertise requise pour évaluer, en l'absence d'un rapport psychologique, la santé psychologique et la force de l'appelante ou le degré de traumatisme émotionnel que pourrait causer à l'appelante son retour dans son pays d'origine.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[9]
La SAR était en effet d'avis que la demanderesse n'avait pas fourni de preuve suffisante pour établir qu'elle faisait partie de la toute petite minorité des demandeurs d'asile auxquels s'applique cette exception. Compte tenu de ce qui précède, la SAR a confirmé la décision de la SPR selon laquelle la demanderesse n'a pas qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger et elle a rejeté l'appel.
[10]
Devant la Cour, la demanderesse a soulevé d'autres questions concernant la protection de l'État et l'examen des documents concernant le pays, dont il ne sera pas discuté davantage vu ma conclusion en l'espèce.
IV.
Question en litige
[11]
La question déterminante est celle de savoir si la SAR a commis une erreur ou agi de manière déraisonnable en exigeant un rapport psychologique de la demanderesse, et de façon plus générale, de tous ceux qui invoquent l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » prévue au paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR.
V.
Norme de contrôle
[12]
La norme de contrôle applicable à une décision de la SAR est une question de droit non résolue. Toutefois, la question de savoir si la SAR a commis une erreur en exigeant la production d'un rapport psychologique de tous les demandeurs d'asile pour qu'ils obtiennent gain de cause sous le régime du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR est une question mixte de faits et de droit susceptible de révision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable. De plus, dans la mesure où il s'agit d'une question pour laquelle la SAR doit interpréter sa propre loi constitutive, compte tenu de l'abondance de la jurisprudence concernant le paragraphe 108(4), la SAR agira de manière déraisonnable si elle s'écarte de la jurisprudence établie: voir les motifs du juge en chef dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 15 et 24 à 26;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Toutefois, je reconnais que le critère applicable à l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » prévue au paragraphe 108(4) pourrait par analogie être examiné selon la norme de la décision correcte: voir les motifs du juge en chef dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 21. Je n'ai pas besoin de déterminer quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable parce que la décision de la SAR est à la fois déraisonnable et incorrecte.
VI.
Analyse
[13]
À mon humble avis, la SAR est parvenue à une conclusion déraisonnable et incorrecte en affirmant que ni la SPR ni la SAR n'avaient l'expertise requise pour évaluer, « en l'absence d'un rapport psychologique », la santé psychologique et la force de l'appelante ou le degré de traumatisme que pourrait lui causer son retour au Kenya.
[14]
À mon avis, cette déclaration est de nature à s'appliquer d'une façon plus générale, non seulement à la SAR mais aussi à la SPR. Par conséquent, elle pourrait avoir pour effet d'exiger la production d'un rapport psychologique de tous ceux qui invoquent l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » prévue au paragraphe 108(4). À mon avis, il s'agit là d'une démarche d'interprétation incorrecte et déraisonnable pour cette disposition.
[15]
Je suis parvenu à cette conclusion pour plusieurs raisons. Premièrement, cette exigence va à l'encontre de la jurisprudence bien établie de la Cour; elle est déraisonnable et incorrecte en ce sens qu'elle ne peut se justifier au regard du « droit », comme l'exige l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47. Deuxièmement, elle entrave indûment l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire des décideurs pertinents; pour cette raison également, l'établissement de cette nouvelle exigence est déraisonnable. Troisièmement, la production obligatoire d'un rapport psychologique impose indûment un fardeau trop lourd aux demandeurs d'asile qui cherchent à obtenir la protection offerte par la convention internationale et les lois canadiennes. Elle importe dans le régime législatif une exigence qui n'est prévue ni dans la loi ni dans les règlements; par conséquent, elle est déraisonnable. Elle aura également tendance à créer un paradigme analytique incomplet et inadéquat. À mon humble avis, cette démarche entièrement nouvelle devrait être rejetée. Me J'analyse ces éléments dans les paragraphes qui suivent.
[16]
La genèse et l'objet de l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » ont récemment été décrits dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], dans lequel le juge en chef a souligné que l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » se limite aux situations où il existe une preuve
prima facie
de persécution passée d'une gravité si exceptionnelle qu'elle atteint un degré tel qu'on la qualifie d'« épouvantable » ou d'« atroce ». De plus, l'exception existe déjà depuis longtemps; elle remonte à la convention sur les réfugiés d'après-guerre de 1951 au moins. Il convient de souligner que l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> n'énonce pas de limite applicable au paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR, comme l'existence d'un préjudice psychologique ou la production d'un rapport psychologique.
[17]
La Cour a rejeté la proposition suivant laquelle la condition préalable au succès d'une demande fondée sur des « raisons impérieuses » était le préjudice psychologique.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour a affirmé:
[26] Je conviens avec la Commission que la preuve de séquelles psychologiques permanentes est pertinente pour le règlement de la question,
mais qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un critère distinct auquel il doit être satisfait
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.) (QL), aux paragraphes 32 à 34). Par conséquent, ce n'est pas parce que le revendicateur souffre du syndrome de stress post-traumatique que l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » s'applique automatiquement.
La Commission doit trancher chaque cas en se fondant sur l'ensemble de la preuve
.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[18]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour a affirmé qu'il n'y avait aucun critère supplémentaire consistant en l'existence de séquelles permanentes, ce qui signifie implicitement là encore qu'il n'y a pas lieu de demander un rapport psychologique:
[20] Cela dit, la Cour a déjà reconnu que des actes de torture antérieurs et des formes extrêmes de violence psychologique, par eux-mêmes, compte tenu de leur gravité, peuvent être considérés comme des « raisons impérieuses » pour accorder le statut de réfugié à un demandeur et aux membres de sa famille immédiate en dépit du fait que ces actes soient survenus de nombreuses années auparavant. Cela ne devrait pas être surprenant étant donné que le droit de ne pas être soumis à de la torture et à un traitement cruel, inhumain et dégradant est un droit fondamental, protégé de la même façon par le droit interne et le droit international, que le Canada s'engage à garantir et à promouvoir. De plus,
bien que la jurisprudence n'impose pas « un critère supplémentaire consistant en l'existence de séquelles permanentes »
, l'omission du tribunal d'avoir pris en compte la preuve médicale pertinente à cet égard constitue une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[Notes de bas de page omises. Non souligné dans l'original.]
[19]
La Cour a affirmé ce qui suit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 34 (CF) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]:
[34]
Je ne pense pas que les décisions invoquées proposent un critère supplémentaire consistant en l'existence de séquelles permanentes
. La jurisprudence n'est, selon moi, aucunement contradictoire. Je crains que l'avocat ait mis l'accent sur les remarques incidentes plutôt que sur les motifs déterminants.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
Là encore, je fais miens ces motifs pour rejeter la proposition selon laquelle la production d'un rapport psychologique est obligatoire en vertu du paragraphe 108(4).
[20]
À mon avis, il ressort clairement de ces décisions qu'il n'y a aucune exigence pour établir la santé psychologique ou la force d'un demandeur ou le degré de traumatisme émotionnel. De même, il n'y a aucune exigence d'établir des séquelles psychologiques. Étant donné qu'il n'y a aucune exigence pour établir des séquelles psychologiques, l'absence de preuve psychologique ne peut logiquement et juridiquement être fatale dans une demande fondée sur des « raisons impérieuses ».
[21]
Il faudrait noter que ces décisions sont antérieures à la création de la SAR.
[22]
En l'absence d'une exigence prévue par la loi, à mon avis et en toute déférence, il n'était pas loisible à la SAR de modifier la règle de droit reconnue par la Cour. Si la SAR était autorisée à le faire, elle pourrait ainsi exercer ses nouveaux pouvoirs de manière déraisonnable. À cet égard, il faut se rappeler que la définition du caractère raisonnable donnée par la Cour suprême du Canada dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47, comprend un volet juridique: le caractère raisonnable tient également « à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits
et du droit
» [non souligné dans l'original]. Je conclus que la décision de la SAR n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard du paragraphe en question édicté par le Parlement, tel qu'il a toujours été interprété et appliqué par la Cour.
[23]
Le changement apporté par la SAR dans les exigences juridiques applicables à l'exception des « raisons impérieuses » est également erroné parce qu'il entrave l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire du décideur. Cette exception tire ses origines de la convention internationale. Comme l'a souligné le juge en chef dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 34, et tel qu'il est mentionné dans la publication des Nations Unies intitulée
Guide et principes directeurs sur les procédures et critères à appliquer pour déterminer le statut des réfugiés au regard de la Convention de 1951 et du protocole de 1967 relatifs au statut des réfugiés
, cette exception « procède d'un principe humanitaire assez général qui peut également être appliqué à des réfugiés autres que les réfugiés statutaires ». Il me semble que ces accords internationaux et les lois qui en résultent ont été conçus pour être plus universels, et non moins universels et pour refléter un principe humanitaire plus général. Ils ne visent pas l'amorce d'une recherche étroite de préjudice psychologique. Exiger un rapport psychologique dans tous les cas pourrait faire échec à cet objet, comme le démontrent les affaires dont il a été question précédemment.
[24]
L'exigence d'un rapport psychologique pose une difficulté connexe: elle alourdit le fardeau qui incombe aux demandeurs d'asile, ce qui affaiblit (par une décision rendue par un tribunal en matière de preuve) les garanties précises que le Parlement souhaitait voir prises en compte et appliquées par le tribunal. Rien ne porte à croire que la SAR, ses prédécesseurs ou la Cour aient éprouvé des difficultés à appliquer les exigences rigoureuses et strictes liées à l'exception des « raisons impérieuses ».
[25]
Je suis également préoccupé par le fait que l'exigence d'un rapport psychologique pourrait avoir, et peut-être aura, l'effet de transformer ce qui est voulu et exprimé comme étant un principe humanitaire général, à savoir lorsque la situation présente des « raisons impérieuses », applicable dans un nouveau paradigme; je suis particulièrement préoccupé par le fait que ce nouveau paradigme sera moins nuancé et simplifié dans une enquête sur ce que les psychologues pourraient avoir à dire. Il existe un autre danger: si les psychologues ne disent rien, aucune réparation ne sera prévisible. Cela va beaucoup trop loin parce qu'il se peut que des personnes dont le rapatriement n'est aucunement justifié aient pleinement droit à l'exception des « raisons impérieuses »; une évaluation psychologique serait inappropriée dans leur cas. À mon humble avis, il n'est ni raisonnable ni judicieux d'établir une nouvelle exigence restrictive en matière de preuve.
[26]
Même si je conviens que les « raisons impérieuses » peuvent dans certains cas, dans de nombreux cas, voire dans la plupart des cas comporter des aspects psychologiques, il ressort clairement de l'extrait suivant de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 19, lequel est souvent cité, qu'il y a beaucoup plus:
[19] Le degré d'anxiété que vit un demandeur d'asile lorsqu'il pense qu'il sera forcé de retourner d'où il vient dépend de l'état de sa santé (force) mentale. La question à poser à l'égard des « raisons impérieuses » est la suivante: Le demandeur devrait-il être exposé à la toile de fond qu'il a quittée même si les acteurs principaux peuvent ne plus être présents ou ne plus jouer les mêmes rôles?
La réponse ne réside pas tellement dans un fait concluant, déterminant et établi, mais plutôt plus dans l'étendue de la douleur intérieure ou de la douleur de l'âme à laquelle un demandeur serait assujetti.
La décision, comme toutes les décisions de nature impérieuse, doit s'appuyer sur l'opinion selon laquelle c'est l'état d'esprit du demandeur qui crée le
précédent
-- pas nécessairement le pays, les conditions, ni l'attitude de la population, même si ces facteurs peuvent jouer un rôle. En outre, cette opinion ne comprend pas l'imposition de concepts occidentaux à un phénomène subtil qui trouve sa source dans l'individualité de la nature humaine, une individualité qui est unique et qui s'est développée dans un environnement social et culturel tout à fait différent. Par conséquent, il devrait également être tenu compte de l'âge du demandeur, de ses antécédents culturels et de ses expériences sociales antérieures.
La capacité de résister à des conditions défavorables dépendra d'un nombre de facteurs qui diffèrent d'un individu à un autre
.

[27]
Le défendeur a soutenu que la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 68 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], exigeait un rapport psychologique. En toute déférence, je ne suis pas d'accord. Il n'est affirmé nulle part dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> qu'un rapport psychologique est obligatoire. Il va sans dire que pareil rapport pourrait être ou sera utile au demandeur d'asile dans bon nombre de cas, mais l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> n'expose pas et ne réforme pas non plus la règle de droit déjà établie par <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[28]
À mon avis, la décision est erronée du fait que la SAR a insisté sur la production d'un rapport psychologique, parce que cette exigence n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit, comme le précise l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[29]
Le défendeur a fait valoir subsidiairement que la preuve en l'espèce ne corrobore pas une conclusion de « raisons impérieuses », en insistant pour dire qu'il incombe à la demanderesse d'établir l'existence de « raisons impérieuses ». Je conviens que le fardeau de cette preuve incombe à la demanderesse; toutefois, ce fardeau ne peut être déterminant lorsque le décideur s'est instruit de manière déraisonnable sur le fardeau de preuve pertinent, comme en l'espèce. La question de savoir si la demanderesse s'est acquittée de ce fardeau devra être tranchée par la SAR à l'occasion du nouvel examen qui sera ordonné.
[30]
L'argument du défendeur au sujet de la preuve est une variante de la doctrine de la futilité, selon laquelle une cour de révision peut refuser d'accueillir une demande de contrôle judiciaire, malgré une erreur donnant matière à révision, lorsqu'elle est convaincue qu'un manquement à l'équité procédurale n'aurait rien changé à la décision:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 5;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 17.
[31]
En l'espèce, l'imposition par la SAR d'une exigence déraisonnable et incorrecte en matière de preuve pouvait en soi avoir un effet sur le résultat. Il serait risqué de confirmer cette décision; par conséquent, elle doit être et elle est annulée.
[32]
Compte tenu des conclusions qui précèdent, il n'est pas nécessaire d'examiner la question de la protection de l'État.
[33]
Ni l'une ni l'autre des parties n'a demandé la certification d'une question, et l'affaire n'en soulève aucune.
VII.
Conclusion
[34]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie.
JUGEMENT
[35]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, la décision est annulée et l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal différemment constitué de la SAR pour nouvel examen. Aucune question n'est certifiée. Aucuns dépens ne sont adjugés.
Application allowed.
