Strickland, J.
: This is an application for judicial review, made pursuant to section 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), of the May 23, 2012 decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board denying the Applicant's claim for Refugee Status as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA, respectively.
Background
[2]
The Applicant is a 39-year old citizen of Lebanon. He claims that in February 1997, agents of the South Lebanese Army (SLA) approached him in the shoe factory where he worked and told him that he had to join the SLA. He reported to the SLA, received military training for a period of three months and then served in the SLA from June 1997 to September 1999 as a corporal. Later in 1999, he left the security zone through Tel Aviv and went to the United States, where he sought refugee protection.
[3]
The Applicant claims that in the aftermath of the Israeli withdrawal from the security zone in May 2000, his immediate relatives were detained and questioned by Hezbollah about his and his brother's whereabouts. Further, that he fears persecution by the Lebanese Hezbollah because he served in the SLA during the South Lebanon conflicts with Hezbollah, because he travelled to Israel, and because of his brother's involvement with the Israeli Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations (Mossad). He also claims that he faces a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, including torture, by the Lebanese Hezbollah, its allies and the Lebanese authorities. His brother, Ramzi, obtained refugee status in Germany. He has a sister who continues to reside in South Lebanon.
[4]
The Applicant was denied refugee status in the United States and came to Canada on August 11, 2010. On September 24, 2010, he claimed protection in Canada as a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and as a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA. By way of Reasons and Decision dated May 17, 2012, the RPD rejected his claim (Decision). This is the judicial review of that Decision.
Decision Under Review
[5]
The Decision states, for the reasons that follow, that the RPD rejects the Applicant's claim to be a Convention refugee.
[6]
The Respondent had submitted that the Applicant should be excluded from Canada's protection in accordance with Article 1F (A) of the
United Nations
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
, July 28, 1951, [1969] Can TS No 6 (Refugee Convention), as a result of his past association with the SLA. The RPD identified discrepancies between the Applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF) and his oral evidence as well as a lack of documentary evidence as to his SLA service. It found that the Applicant was not credible and, on the balance of probabilities, that he had fabricated his involvement with the SLA to support his refugee claim. For that reason, the RPD found that the Respondent's application for exclusion must fail.
[7]
The RPD then dealt with the post-hearing submissions made by Applicant's counsel asserting that because the Applicant's brother served with the Israeli Mossad, the Applicant would face a risk of torture or a risk to his life and was therefore in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA. In that regard, the RPD noted that the Applicant's sister has continuously lived in South Lebanon and that there was no evidence that she has ever had problems with Hezbollah. Therefore, it was not probable that the Applicant would suffer serious harm as a result of his brother's involvement with Mossad, should he return to Lebanon.
[8]
The RPD concluded "[f]or all of the above, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the claim pursuant to both sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
."
Issues
[9]
In the hearing before me, counsel for the Applicant advised that, of the issues identified in the application for judicial review and in its written submissions, only one issue was being pursued. This is, in essence, whether the RPD erred by failing to conduct a separate section 96 IRPA analysis. It should be noted that the Applicant made no challenge to the RPD's findings as to credibility nor to its rejection of his section 97 claim.
[10]
The Respondent states that the sole issue is whether the Applicant has demonstrated that the decision of the RPD was unreasonable in that it fell outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes given the evidence and the law.
[11]
I would phrase the issues as follows:
i) What is the standard of review?
ii) Was the RPD required to conduct a separate section 96 analysis in the circumstances of this matter?
iii) Was its Decision reasonable?
The Positions of the Parties
[12]
The Applicant submits that the RPD's finding that he is not a credible witness is not determinative of the question of whether the Applicant is a Convention refugee. Credible or not, he is still a refugee if he satisfies the subjective and objective components of the test for refugee status.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Court of Appeal held that the RPD must rule not only on credibility issues but also on the well-foundedness of the fear alleged by the refugee claimant in order to determine whether the evidence satisfies both the objective and the subjective branches of the test.
[13]
The Applicant submits that although the RPD rejected his evidence respecting his involvement in the SLA, it did accept that his brother had been involved with Mossad. However, the RPD only considered this in the context of section 97 of the IRPA, his claim as a person in need of protection, and failed to consider it in the context of section 96 of the IRPA, his claim for protection as a Convention refugee. The RPD therefore erred in failing to make a determination as to whether, based on the evidence accepted as credible, the Applicant qualified as a Convention refugee (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[14]
Further, the Applicant argues that had the RPD conducted a section 96 analysis based on the evidence that it accepted as credible, then it would have had to apply the objective basis for a well-founded fear of persecution test under section 96 of the IRPA, the "reasonable chance" test. This is less stringent than the balance of probabilities test applicable to claims for protection made pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Applicant submits that failure to conduct a section 96 analysis is an error in law.
[15]
The Respondent submits that the RPD did conduct a section 96 analysis but rejected that basis of the Applicant's claim because he lacked credibility. The Respondent also submits that the Applicant presented no evidence to establish that he held a well-founded and subjective fear of persecution based on a perceived political opinion or his brother's association with Mossad. The mere fact that his brother worked for Mossad was not evidence of the Applicant's well-founded fear of persecution. Being a family member of someone who might be targeted is insufficient to establish membership in a particular social group as a Convention ground. In absence of a demonstrated subjective fear, such as one based upon persecutory acts committed against the Applicant's family in the past or other compelling evidence, the Applicant's claim could not succeed under section 96 of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[16]
The Respondent submits that, in any event, granting the Applicant's judicial review would serve no purpose because "the demerits of the claim are such that it would in any case be hopeless" and "the claim could only be rejected" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is because the Applicant failed to point to any evidence to support his allegation of perceived political opinion or membership in a particular social group that would change the outcome of his refugee claim hearing, accordingly, his claim could only be rejected.
Analysis
i)
Standard of Review
[17]
The Supreme Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 34 and 45, held that there are two standards of review, reasonableness for questions of mixed fact and law and correctness for questions of law. Reasonableness is a deferential standard concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision making process but also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47). Where previous jurisprudence has satisfactorily determined the appropriate standard of review applicable to a particular issue, that standard may be adopted by a subsequent reviewing court ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 57 and 62).
[18]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Kelen held that:
[25] The Board's interpretation of the requirements of sections 96 and 97 of the Act is a question of law to be reviewed on a standard of correctness:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[26] The Board's assessment of whether the applicants are persons in need of protection and whether they face a particularized risk, however, is a question of mixed fact and law and subject to review on a reasonableness standard: see, for example, my decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[19]
The issue in this matter does not concern the legal interpretation of the requirements of section 96. Rather, it is concerned with whether, in the circumstances of this matter, the RPD was required to conduct a separate section 96 analyses in order to determine if the Applicant had established that he held a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his membership in a particular social group, his family, or a perceived political belief, that he is a supporter of Israel.
[20]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Court was called upon to determine whether the RPD erred by rejecting the applicants' claims under sections 96 and 97 solely on the basis of their lack of subjective fear and without conducting a separate section 97 analysis. Justice Crampton (as he then was) stated that the standard of review that has been applied by this Court in similar cases generally depends upon how the Court characterized the nature of the question. Where the question has been characterized as being a question of law or of adequacy of reasons, the Court has stated that a standard of correctness applies. By contrast, where the question has been characterized as one of mixed fact and law, the Court has stated that a standard of reasonableness applies. At paragraph 22 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Court held that:
[22] In my view, the RPD ought to be accorded deference with respect to whether it deals with claims made under both sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA separately or in a single integrated analysis, particularly given (i) the RPD's substantial expertise with respect to the issues that are raised in claims made under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA, and (ii) the nature of the issues raised when claims are made under both of those sections is such that it is often not necessary to conduct a separate analysis under each of these sections, especially where credibility or the adequacy of state protection is a determinative issue ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 55, 56, 64 and 66;
Khosa
, above, at para. 44). In this context, a failure to accord some deference to the RPD in this regard would not be consistent with the view that the concept of deference is "central to judicial review in administrative law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 48).
[21]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, on the issue of whether the RPD erred by failing to conduct a separate analysis under section 97, the standard of reasonableness was applied.
[22]
Here the evidence before the RPD was common to both the claim for protection as a Convention refugee under section 96 and as a person in need of protection under section 97. The primary issue in either analysis is the sufficiency of the factual evidence to establish the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution with a nexus to a Convention ground, or, a risk of torture or to life. Accordingly, and based on the jurisprudence, in my view this issue is properly characterized as being a question of mixed law and fact. Therefore, the issues are to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness (also see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the reasonableness standard was applied to the question whether the RPD erred by not conducting an analysis under section 96).
ii)
Separate Section 96 Analysis
[23]
A Convention refugee is defined in section 96 of the IRPA as:
96.
Convention refugee - A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable, or by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; or
[...]
96.
A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a
) soit se trouve hors de tout pays don't elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
[...]
[24]
Section 97 of the IRPA defines a person in need of protection as:
97.
(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(
a
) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
[...]
97.
(1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a
) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
[...]
[25]
To make a successful section 96 claim, an applicant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. This has both a subjective and an objective element. "The subjective component relates to the existence of the fear of persecution in the mind of the refugee. The objective component requires that the refugee's fear be evaluated objectively to determine if there is a valid basis for that fear" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). An applicant must establish its case on the balance of probabilities and meet the legal test of "reasonable chance" or "more than a mere possibility". That is, is there a reasonable chance that persecution would take place if the applicant were returned to his or her country of origin. This "need not be more than a 50% chance but is more than a minimal possibility" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 4-5 and 8-9; followed and explained in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 14 [
Li
]). The test for the degree of danger of torture in subsection 97(1)(a) is a balance of probabilities or more likely than not (
Li
, above, at para 28). The standard of proof and the test under subsection 97(1)(a) are distinct (
Li
, above, at paras 29 and 33).
[29] It is immediately apparent that the words used to describe the standard of proof - balance of probabilities - are equivalent to the words used to describe the legal test to be met in order to be entitled to protection under paragraph 97(1)(
a
) - more likely than not. Although the words are equivalent, there are two distinct steps involved. Proof on a balance of probabilities is the standard of proof the panel will apply in assessing the evidence adduced before it for purposes of making its factual findings. The test for determining the danger of torture is whether, on the facts found by the panel, the panel is satisfied that it is more likely than not that the individual would personally be subjected to a danger of torture.
[...]
[33] It is true that at a refugee hearing a panel may be asked to consider both whether an individual is a Convention refugee and whether that individual is in need of protection. Some of the evidence may apply to both determinations. However, there are differences between section 96 and paragraph 97(1)(
a
). For example, a claim for protection under paragraph 97(1)(
a
) is not predicated on the individual demonstrating that he or she is in danger of torture for any of the enumerated grounds of section 96. Further, there are both subjective and objective components necessary to satisfy the requirements of section 96: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 120
per
Major J., while a claim under paragraph 97(1)(
a
) has no subjective component. Because of such differences, it cannot be said that the provisions are so closely related that it would be irrational if the test under paragraph 97(1)(
a
) was not identical to the test under section 96.
[27]
The test under subsection 97(1)(b) is also that the risk is more likely than not (
Li
, above, at para 29).
[28]
While the tests for section 96 and section 97 differ, what is common to these two sections is the standard of proof. In each case the applicant must provide evidence that establishes, on the balance of probabilities, the factual basis for the claim (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
As stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the RPD is to be accorded deference with respect to whether it deals with claims made under both sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA separately or in a single integrated analysis. In the context of determining whether the failure to conduct a separate section 97 analysis constitutes a reviewable error, it has been held that it is permissible to analyze the claims together (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Whether an omission amounts to a reviewable error depends on the particular circumstances of each case (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Where no claims have been made or evidence adduced that would warrant such a separate analysis, it will not be required ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 49).
[30]
The jurisprudence is summarized in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above:
[13]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Mr. Justice Blanchard discussed this issue in the context of a situation where identity was not disputed, but the country conditions might lead to an objective fear (though still based on personal circumstances) of section 97 risk, even if the subjective fear was found to be not credible. Justice Blanchard noted the distinction between section 96 and section 97 claims and stated that although the evidentiary basis may be the same, the claims should be considered as separate. Most importantly, for present purposes, he stated, "Whether a Board properly considered both claims is a matter to be determined in the circumstances of each individual case bearing in mind the different elements required to establish each claim". Although the board had erred in failing to specifically analyze the section 97 claim, its error was not material to the result in that case.
[14]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Mr. Justice Mosley, at paragraph 27 stated:
In my opinion, the Board in this case did not address the country documentation and other evidence related to prison conditions in Turkey and failed to consider whether the applicant could be a "person in need of protection" if returned to that country, in light of the possibility that he may face a "serious prison sentence" for evading Turkish military service. Despite the Board's negative credibility findings, a separate analysis, along the lines described in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
, and having regard to the legislative wording of section 97, may have produced a finding that Mr. Kilic was a person in need of protection. Therefore, the result of the Board's error is unknown, and accordingly, this application should be sent back for redetermination on this ground.
It is evident that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, there was evidence that was not addressed under the section 96 analysis that should have received section 97 consideration.
[15]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Mr. Justice von Finckenstein found that the board's negative credibility finding was substantiated by the facts and that the failure to perform a section 97 analysis was not relevant to the result because of a lack of evidence.
[16] Mr. Justice Gibson, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  determined that the board did not err in arriving at its negative credibility finding. Since the sole bases for the claim were Convention grounds (ethnicity and membership in a particular social group), the board's credibility and risk analyses were sufficient to support a denial of refugee status. Justice Gibson further determined that the claimant was not a person in need of protection because no ground to support a need of protection other than a Convention ground had been advanced. While a more extensive explanation for the board's determination regarding section 97 might have been desirable, its absence did not constitute reviewable error.
[17] These authorities, in my view, do not demand that a section 97 analysis be performed in every case. Rather, it will be required in some cases. It is a question that must be reviewed on a case by case basis. If there is evidence before the board to support a section 97 analysis, the analysis must be conducted.
[18] Thus, while a separate section 97 analysis is desirable, the failure to conduct such an analysis will not be fatal in circumstances where there is no evidence that would require it. Here, there were no other grounds to support a finding of person in need of protection and the risk analysis was performed for Mrs. Brovina in the context of refugee protection. Moreover, the board did conduct a brief analysis related to a section 97 risk when it found that there was "no reason to believe" that Mrs. Brovina would face any risk in returning to Albania. There was no objective evidence before the board that might have led to any other conclusion.
[31] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, was also considered in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, where Justice Martineau stated:
[14] The applicants cite
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
, for the proposition that section 97 must be separately considered in every case. The finding in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
, was actually that the failure to separately consider objective risk under section 97 can be either a reviewable error or an irrelevant error depending on the evidence entered, and this determination must be made on a case-by-case basis.
[15] Blanchard J. further found that in the specific circumstances of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
, the failure to separately analyse section 97 did not rise to the level of a reviewable error:
Apart from the evidence that the Board found to be not credible, there was no other evidence before the board in the country documentation, or elsewhere, that could have led the Board to conclude that the applicant was a person in need of protection. I find that the Board did err in failing to specifically analyse the s. 97 claim. However, in the circumstances of this case and in the exercise of my discretion, I also find that the error is not material to the result.
[32]
The Court went on to say that subsequent jurisprudence has found that the lack of a separate section 97 analysis to be both reviewable and non-reviewable, depending on the circumstances and that "[t]he distinction explicitly depends on the nature of the evidence presented in the case" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 16).
[33]
In the matter before me, the question is whether the RPD committed a reviewable error if it did not conduct a separate section 96 analysis. The RPD states in the Decision that it is not probable that the Applicant will suffer serious harm as a result of his brother's involvement with Mossad, should he return to Lebanon, and rejects the Applicant's claim pursuant to both sections 96 and 97.
[34]
In my view, although the Decision does not specify that a single integrated section 96 and section 97 analysis was being undertaken, in the circumstances of this matter that was a permissible approach. However, even if the RPD should have and failed to conduct a separate section 96 analysis, this was not relevant to the result and does not constitute a reviewable error.
[35]
I reach this conclusion primarily based on the evidence that was before the RPD. With respect to the Applicant's brother's association with Mossad, his PIF does not identify what the social group the Applicant claims to be a member of that would give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. This is touched on in his attached Statement of Fact where he states:
In Lebanon, Hezbollah and it allies and the Lebanese authorities will punish me for being a corporal in the SLA, for having traveled to Israel, and having a brother Ramzi who worked for the Mosad. I will be tortured to determine the extent of my involvement in the SLA and Israeli military and Ramzi's involvement with the Mosad. In May 2000 in the aftermath of the Israeli withdrawal my immediate relatives were detained and questioned by Hezbollah about my whereabouts and Ramzi's because we were wanted by Hezbollah. [...] I will not be safe in Lebanon because of my past association with the SLA. Also given the fact that my brother Ramzi worked for the Israeli Mosad puts my life at in danger in Lebanon. My brother fled to Germany where he was accepted and is now a German citizen.
[36]
This issue was not addressed at the hearing before the RPD other than by a comment of the Applicant's counsel at the conclusion of the hearing. He submitted that even if the RPD did not accept the evidence as to the Applicant's membership in the SLA "the fact that the Applicant's brother, Ramsi, was with the MOSSAD puts him in a dangerous position regardless of whether he was in the South Lebanon Army or not." Counsel went on to say that Hezbollah creates:
[...] a dangerous situation for him, and there is a reasonable chance he would even be kidnapped, tortured, for his brother to surrender himself, because he, he was with the Israeli MOSSAD and he would have information that he doesn't have, because he was just a regular soldier. But somebody in the MOSSAD would have a lot more use for Hezbollah. So this is a danger for him. [...]
[37]
Given this oral submission by counsel at the hearing, the RPD asked the Applicant to make written submissions on section 97. These are addressed in the Decision:
[13] Counsel for the claimant, post hearing, made written submissions for acceptance pursuant to section 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
(IRPA). Since the claimant's brother served Mossad and was accepted as a refugee in Germany, it is Counsel's position that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would be tortured or in other ways his life would be at risk since he would be of interest to Hezbollah as a means of gathering information concerning his brother Ramzi.
[14] The claimant's sister is also a sister to Ramzi and she has lived in South Lebanon continuously. There is no evidence she has ever had problems with Hezbollah. This being the case, I am satisfied, it is not probable that the claimant will suffer serious harm as a result of his brother's involvement with Mossad, should he return to Lebanon today.
[38]
The RPD found the Applicant not to be credible and rejected his evidence respecting his military service in the SLA. It accepted the Applicant's claim that his brother had been involved with the Mossad and conducted an additional analysis of this issue under section 97. However, in doing so, the RPD found that there was no basis for the Applicant's alleged risk because there was no evidence that other members of the Applicant's family, and in particular his sister who lived in South Lebanon, suffered persecution by Hezbollah as a result of his brother's activities in the Mossad.
[39]
The RPD found that it was not probable that the Applicant would suffer harm as a result of his brother's activities. While this finding was made in the context of the section 97 analysis, it also means that the Applicant could not, on the same and common evidence, meet the standard of proof required in a section 96 analysis. Put otherwise, in the absence of any evidence on the record before it that could establish that the Applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution, the RPD did not have to engage in a further or separate section 96 analysis. Secondly, even if it had, this same lack of evidence would have precluded the Applicant from establishing both that he had a well-founded fear of persecution and the necessary nexus to a particular social group, his family, as addressed below.
[40]
The jurisprudence of this Court and that of the Federal Court of Appeal establishes that membership in a family can constitute membership in a social group for the purposes of refugee protection, but persecution against one family member does not automatically entitle all other family members to be considered refugees (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As Justice Mosley stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[8] The law requires that a refugee claimant show that there is a personal nexus between him and the alleged persecution based on one of the Convention refugee grounds. Thus, indirect persecution is not a solid foundation for a Convention refugee claim:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 2164 (QL).
[9] That the family is a valid social group for the purposes of seeking refugee protection is well established. Where membership in a family group is the basis for the claim, a personal nexus must be established between the claimant and the alleged persecution on Convention grounds: Pour-Shariati. It is not enough to point to the persecution suffered by family members if it is unlikely to affect the claimant directly. In this case, there was a sufficient nexus between the applicant's claim and his wife and daughter's persecution. The applicant is the husband and father of the women and therefore he would directly be at risk resulting from the decision not to allow his daughter's circumcision.
[41]
In
Granada
, above, at para 16, Justice Martineau specified the evidence required for such claims to be made under section 96 of the IRPA:
[16] The family can only be considered to be a social group in cases where there is evidence that the persecution is taking place against the family members as a social group:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 657 (F.C.T.D.) (QL). However, membership in the social group formed by the family is not without limits, it requires some proof that the family in question is itself, as a group, the subject of reprisals and vengeance or, in other words, that the applicants are targeted and marked simply because they are members of the family even though they themselves have never been involved in politics and never will be so involved. (
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) (QL)). [...]
[42]
In light of this jurisprudence, it is clear that the Applicant did not satisfactorily discharge his burden of establishing that he had a well-founded fear of persecution that qualified him as a Convention refugee as a result of his membership in his brother's family. There was no evidence that other family members were subject to persecution or that the Applicant would as a result of his brother's association with Mossad. Rather, and as noted in the Decision, the evidence was that the Applicant's sister has lived in South Lebanon continuously and there is no evidence that she has ever had problems with Hezbollah. As such, no separate review of the evidence under section 96 was required.
[43]
In conclusion, the RPD is to be accorded deference in its decisions as to whether it deals with claims made under both section 96 and section 97 separately or in a single integrated analysis. In this case the RPD's intent is not explicit. However, while an explanation of the RPD's disposition of the section 96 claim would have been desirable, in the circumstances of this case its absence is not fatal.
[44]
Here the evidence was common to both claims and there was no evidence adduced that required a separate analysis. More specifically, in the absence of any evidence to support the Applicant's claim that he was at risk because of his brother's involvement in Mossad or because of his perceive political opinion, the Applicant could not meet the burden of proof required in either his section 96 or section 97 claim. Thus, even if the RPD erred in failing to conduct a separate section 96 analysis, and I do not find that it did in this case, this was not a reviewable error as it was not material to the result.
iii)
Reasonableness
[45]
As stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47, reasonableness is a deferential standard concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision making process but also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the Decision was reasonable and falls within the range of possible acceptable outcomes in this case.
JUDGMENT
[46]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed. No question of general importance for certification has been proposed and none arises.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu de l'article 72 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,
LC 2001, c 27 (LIPR), de la décision du 23 mai 2012 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) refusait au demandeur le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention ou celui de personne à protéger selon les articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR, respectivement.
Contexte
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen du Liban âgé de 39 ans. Il prétend qu'en février 1997, des agents de l'Armée du Liban du Sud (ALS) ont pris contact avec lui dans l'usine de souliers où il travaillait et l'ont avisé qu'il devait joindre les rangs de l'ALS. Il s'est donc présenté à l'ALS, a suivi l'instruction militaire pendant trois mois et a servi ensuite dans l'ALS de juin 1997 à septembre 1999 en tant que caporal. Plus tard au cours de cette année, il a quitté la zone de sécurité en passant par Tel Aviv et s'est enfui aux États-Unis, où il a demandé l'asile.
[3]
Le demandeur allègue qu'après que les Israéliens se sont retirés de la zone de sécurité en mai 2000, les membres de sa famille immédiate ont été détenus et interrogés par le Hezbollah au sujet de ses allées et venues et de celles de son frère. Il dit aussi craindre d'être persécuté aux mains du Hezbollah libanais parce qu'il a servi dans l'ALS lors des conflits entre le Liban du Sud et le Hezbollah, parce qu'il s'est rendu en Israël, et parce que son frère a participé aux activités du Mossad, l'Institut du renseignement et des opérations spéciales d'Israël. Il prétend aussi qu'il craint pour sa vie et qu'il risque de subir des traitements ou des peines cruels et inusités, dont la torture, de la part du Hezbollah libanais, de ses alliés et des autorités libanaises. Son frère, Ramzi, a obtenu l'asile en Allemagne; il a aussi une soeur qui vit toujours au Liban-Sud.
[4]
Le demandeur s'est vu refuser l'asile aux États-Unis et est venu au Canada le 11 août 2010. Le 24 septembre suivant, il a demandé la protection du Canada en qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention en vertu de l'article 96 de la LIPR et de personne à protéger en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR. Dans ses motifs et son jugement datés du 17 mai 2012, la SPR a rejeté sa demande (décision). C'est cette décision qui fait l'objet du présent contrôle judiciaire.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[5]
La décision indique que, pour les motifs qui suivent, la SPR rejette la demande de statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention présentée par le demandeur.
[6]
Le défendeur a fait valoir que le demandeur ne pouvait pas bénéficier de la protection du Canada conformément à l'alinéa 1F
a
) de la
Convention relative au statut des réfugiés des Nations Unies
, 28 juillet 1951, [1969] R.T. Can no 6 (Convention), étant donné son association passée avec l'ALS. Selon la SPR, des divergences existaient entre l'information fournie dans le Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) et le témoignage oral du demandeur, et les preuves documentaires relativement à son service dans l'ALS étaient insuffisantes. Elle a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible et que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, il avait inventé de toutes pièces sa participation au sein de l'ALS pour appuyer sa demande d'asile. C'est pourquoi la SPR a jugé que la demande d'exclusion du défendeur devait être rejetée.
[7]
La SPR a ensuite examiné les observations postérieures à l'audience présentées par le conseil du demandeur et selon lesquelles le demandeur risquait la torture ou la mort parce que son frère avait servi dans le Mossad israélien et qu'il avait par conséquent besoin de la protection conférée par l'article 97 de la LIPR. À cet égard, la SPR a fait remarquer que la soeur du demandeur avait toujours vécu au Liban-Sud et que rien n'indiquait que le Hezbollah lui avait jamais causé des difficultés. En conséquence, il n'était pas probable qu'en retournant au Liban, le demandeur soit exposé à un grave préjudice en raison de la participation de son frère aux activités du Mossad.
[8]
La SPR a conclu ainsi: « Pour l'ensemble des motifs susmentionnés, la Section de la protection des réfugiés rejette la demande d'asile suivant les articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
. »
Questions en litige
[9]
Au cours de l'audience, le conseil du demandeur a signalé que, de tous les points soulevés dans la demande de contrôle judiciaire et dans ses observations écrites, un seul était en litige. Essentiellement, il s'agit de savoir si la SPR a fait erreur en n'effectuant pas une analyse distincte au regard de l'article 96 de la LIPR. Il convient de noter que le demandeur ne conteste pas la décision de la SPR relativement à sa crédibilité ou à sa demande d'asile fondée sur l'article 97.
[10]
Le défendeur affirme que la seule question en litige est de savoir si le demandeur a prouvé que la décision de la SPR était déraisonnable en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables compte tenu de la preuve et du droit applicable.
[11]
Je reformulerais les questions en litige comme suit:
i) Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
ii) La SPR était-elle tenue de faire une analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 96 étant donné les circonstances de l'espèce?
iii) Sa décision était-elle raisonnable?
Arguments des parties
[12]
Le demandeur fait valoir que la conclusion de la SPR voulant qu'il ne soit pas un témoin crédible ne peut être déterminante de la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention. Crédible ou non, il n'en reste pas moins un réfugié s'il satisfait aux composantes subjective et objective du critère applicable à la qualité de réfugié. Dans les arrêts
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour d'appel a statué que la SPR doit tirer ses conclusions non seulement au regard de la crédibilité, mais aussi du bien-fondé de la crainte alléguée par le demandeur d'asile pour déterminer si la preuve satisfait à la fois à la composante objective et à la composante subjective du critère applicable pour établir la qualité de réfugié.
[13]
Le demandeur fait valoir que même si la SPR a rejeté sa preuve quant à son implication dans l'ALS, elle a accepté que son frère participait aux activités du Mossad. Cependant, la SPR a examiné cette preuve uniquement dans le contexte de l'article 97 de la LIPR, à savoir sa demande en qualité de personne à protéger, et non dans le contexte de l'article 96, à savoir sa demande de protection en qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention. Par conséquent, la SPR a fait erreur en ne déterminant pas, à la lumière de la preuve considérée comme crédible, si le demandeur était admissible en qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[14]
Par ailleurs, le demandeur prétend que si la SPR avait fait une analyse fondée sur l'article 96 à la lumière de la preuve qu'elle a reconnue comme crédible, elle n'aurait alors pas eu à appliquer la composante objective du critère de la crainte fondée de persécution prévu à l'article 96 de la LIPR, le critère de la « possibilité raisonnable ». Ce critère est moins strict que celui de la prépondérance des probabilités qui s'applique aux demandes d'asile fondées sur le paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 8 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le demandeur fait valoir que le défaut d'effectuer une analyse fondée sur l'article 96 constitue une erreur de droit.
[15]
Le défendeur fait valoir que la SPR a effectivement fait une analyse fondée sur l'article 96, mais qu'elle a rejeté ce motif de revendication à cause du manque de crédibilité du demandeur. Le défendeur soutient aussi que le demandeur n'a présenté aucun élément de preuve tendant à prouver qu'il avait une crainte fondée et subjective d'être persécuté en raison d'opinions politiques présumées ou de l'association de son frère avec le Mossad. Le fait que son frère travaillait pour le Mossad ne pouvait à lui seul prouver qu'il craignait avec raison d'être persécuté. Il ne suffit pas d'être apparenté à un individu qui risque d'être pris pour cible pour avoir qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention en raison d'une appartenance à un groupe social. En l'absence d'une crainte subjective établie, comme la crainte découlant d'actes de persécution commis par le passé contre la famille du demandeur, ou d'autres preuves éloquentes, la demande ne pourrait être accueillie sur le fondement de l'article 96 de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[16]
Le défendeur soutient que, quoi qu'il en soit, il ne serait pas utile d'accueillir la demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur étant donné que « le fondement de la demande est à ce point faible que la cause est de toute façon sans espoir [...] et que la demande ne pourrait être que rejetée » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En effet, le demandeur n'a pas fourni, pour étayer son allégation de persécution du fait de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques présumées, une preuve qui aurait pu changer l'issue de l'audience de sa demande d'asile et c'est pour cela que sa demande ne pouvait qu'être rejetée.
Analyse
i)
La norme de contrôle
[17] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Dunsmuir
, précité, la Cour suprême a statué, aux paragraphes 34 et 45, qu'il y a lieu de se fonder sur deux normes de contrôle, celle de la décision raisonnable pour ce qui a trait aux questions mixtes de droit et de fait, et celle de la décision correcte, pour ce qui a trait aux questions de droit. La norme du caractère raisonnable est une norme déférente qui tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47). Si la jurisprudence a déjà établi la norme de contrôle applicable à une question donnée, cette norme peut être adoptée par la cour de révision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 57 et 62).
[18]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 26 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], le juge Kelen a maintenu ce qui suit:
[25] La manière dont la Commission a interprété les conditions des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi est une question de droit qui doit être contrôlée d'après la norme de la décision correcte:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[26] La question de savoir si les demandeurs sont des personnes à protéger et s'ils sont exposés à un risque particularisé est cependant une question mixte de droit et de fait qui appelle l'application de la norme de la décision raisonnable: voir, par exemple, une décision antérieure rendue par le soussigné,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 31.
[19]
En l'espèce, ce n'est pas l'interprétation juridique des exigences de l'article 96 qui est en litige; la question est plutôt de savoir si la SPR était tenue d'effectuer une analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 96 pour déterminer si le demandeur avait une crainte fondée d'être persécuté en raison de son appartenance à un groupe social donné et des activités de sa famille, ou bien en raison d'opinions politiques présumées en faveur d'Israël.
[20]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour a été appelée à déterminer si la SPR avait commis une erreur en rejetant les demandes d'asile présentées en vertu des articles 96 et 97 du seul fait de l'absence de crainte subjective, et en n'effectuant pas une analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 97. Le juge Crampton (maintenant juge en chef) a déclaré que la norme de contrôle appliquée dans des cas semblables dépend généralement de la manière dont la Cour qualifie la question. Si elle estime qu'il s'agit d'une question de droit ou que la suffisance des motifs est en jeu, alors la Cour applique la norme de la décision correcte. En revanche, si elle estime qu'il s'agit d'une question mixte de droit et de fait, la Cour applique alors la norme de la décision raisonnable. Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la Cour a déclaré ceci au paragraphe 22:
[22] À mon avis, la décision de la SPR appelle la retenue dans la mesure où elle concerne la question de savoir si elle doit faire une analyse séparée ou combinée pour une demande d'asile présentée à la fois en vertu de l'article 96 et de l'article 97 de la LIPR. Cette retenue se justifie de deux manières: (i) la SPR jouit d'une spécialisation élevée au regard des questions qui sont soulevées dans une demande d'asile relevant des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR, et (ii) la nature des questions soulevées lorsqu'une demande d'asile est présentée en vertu de ces deux dispositions est telle qu'il n'est souvent pas nécessaire de faire une analyse distincte au regard de chacune d'elles, surtout si la question déterminante concerne la crédibilité du demandeur d'asile ou le niveau de la protection offerte par l'État (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 55, 56, 64 et 66; arrêt
Khosa
, précité, au paragraphe 44). Dans ce contexte, un non-acquiescement à la décision de la SPR ne serait pas conforme à l'idée selon laquelle la notion de retenue est « fondamentale au contrôle judiciaire en droit administratif » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 48).
[21]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, s'agissant de la question de savoir si la SPR a commis une erreur en ne faisant pas une analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 97, la norme de la décision raisonnable a été appliquée.
[22]
En l'espèce, la preuve présentée à la SPR s'appliquait à la fois à la demande de statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention en vertu de l'article 96 et à la demande de statut de personne à protéger en vertu de l'article 97. Quelle que soit l'analyse, il convient de déterminer si la preuve factuelle suffit à établir l'existence d'une crainte fondée de persécution liée à l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention ou encore d'un risque de torture ou de mort. En conséquence, et compte tenu de la jurisprudence, j'estime que cette question peut être considérée comme une question mixte de droit et de fait et doit être examinée selon la norme du caractère raisonnable (voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  où la cour a appliqué la norme de raisonnabilité à la question de savoir si la SPR avait commis une erreur en ne procédant pas à une analyse fondée sur l'article 96).
ii)
Analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 96
[23]
Un réfugié au sens de la Convention est défini comme suit à l'article 96 de la LIPR:
96.
A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a
) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
[...]
96.
Convention refugee - A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable, or by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; or
[...]
[24]
La « personne à protéger » est définie comme suit à l'article 97 de la LIPR:
97.
(1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
[...]
97.
(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(
a
) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
[...]
[25]
Pour que sa demande d'asile présentée en vertu de l'article 96 soit accueillie, le demandeur doit prouver qu'il craint à raison d'être persécuté. Cette crainte a à la fois une composante objective et une composante subjective. [traduction] « L'élément subjectif se rapporte à l'existence de la crainte de persécution dans l'esprit du réfugié. L'élément objectif nécessite l'appréciation objective de la crainte du réfugié pour déterminer si elle est fondée. » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le demandeur doit établir le bien-fondé de sa demande selon la prépondérance des probabilités et satisfaire au critère juridique selon lequel il existe une « possibilité raisonnable » ou « plus qu'une simple possibilité » d'être persécuté, autrement dit qu'il existe une possibilité raisonnable qu'il soit persécuté s'il retournait dans son pays d'origine. « [I]l n'y a pas à y avoir une chance supérieure à 50 % [ ... mais] il doit exister davantage qu'une possibilité minime » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 4 et 5 et 8 et 9, décision appliquée et expliquée dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 14 [
Li
]). Le critère permettant de déterminer le degré de risque de torture visé à l'alinéa 97(1)
a
) est celui de la probabilité la plus forte ou « plus probable que le contraire » (
Li
, précité, au paragraphe 28). La norme de preuve et le critère à appliquer en vertu de l'alinéa 97(1)
a
) sont distincts (
Li
, précité, aux paragraphes 29 et 33).
[29] Il devient immédiatement apparent que les termes utilisés pour décrire la norme de preuve - la probabilité la plus forte - sont ceux qui sont utilisés pour décrire le critère objectif auquel il doit être satisfait afin d'avoir qualité de personne à protéger en vertu de l'alinéa 97(1)
a
), à savoir, plus probable que le contraire. Même si les termes sont à peu près identiques, il y a deux étapes distinctes. La preuve selon la prépondérance des probabilités est la norme de preuve que le tribunal applique dans l'appréciation d'une preuve afin de tirer ses conclusions de fait. Le critère permettant de déterminer le risque de torture est de savoir, compte tenu des faits dont le tribunal est saisi, si le tribunal est convaincu qu'il est plus probable que le contraire que l'individu serait personnellement soumis à un danger de torture.
[...]
[33] Certes, lors d'une audience sur le statut de réfugié, le tribunal peut être appelé à se demander si l'individu est un réfugié au sens de la Convention et s'il est une personne à protéger. Certaines preuves peuvent s'appliquer aux deux décisions. Toutefois, l'article 96 et l'alinéa 97(1)
a
) sont différents. Par exemple, pour demander la protection en vertu de l'alinéa 97(1)
a
), l'individu n'est pas obligé d'établir qu'il risque d'être soumis à la torture pour l'un des motifs énumérés à l'article 96. En outre, il existe des composantes tant subjectives qu'objectives nécessaires afin de satisfaire aux exigences de l'article 96: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 120, le juge Major, alors qu'une demande en vertu de l'alinéa 97(1)
a
) n'a aucune composante subjective. À cause de ces différences, on ne saurait prétendre que les dispositions sont à ce point semblables qu'il serait illogique que le critère de l'alinéa 97(1)
a
) ne soit pas identique au critère de l'article 96.
[27]
Le critère à appliquer en vertu de l'alinéa 97(1)
b
) consiste à déterminer s'il est plus probable que le contraire que l'individu soit soumis à un risque de torture (
Li
, précité, au paragraphe 29).
[28]
Si les critères à appliquer en vertu des articles 96 et 97 diffèrent, ces deux dispositions ont toutefois en commun la norme de preuve. Dans chaque cas, le demandeur doit présenter des éléments de preuve tendant à établir, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, les faits sur lesquels repose la demande (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 27).
[29]
Ainsi qu'il est mentionné dans le jugement <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la décision de la SPR appelle la retenue dans la mesure où elle concerne la question de savoir si la SPR doit faire une analyse distincte ou combinée d'une demande d'asile présentée à la fois en vertu de l'article 96 et de l'article 97 de la LIPR. Pour déterminer si la décision de ne pas effectuer une analyse distincte en vertu de l'article 97 constitue une erreur susceptible de contrôle, la cour a statué qu'il est possible de faire une analyse combinée des revendications (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La question de savoir si le fait de ne pas avoir fait de distinction constitue une erreur susceptible de révision dépend des circonstances particulières de chaque affaire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Lorsqu'une analyse distincte n'est pas justifiée par les allégations faites ou par la preuve produite, elle n'est pas requise (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 18) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 49).
[30]
La jurisprudence est résumée dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée:
[13]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Blanchard a examiné la question dans le contexte d'une affaire dans laquelle l'identité n'était pas contestée, mais où la situation dans le pays pouvait donner lieu à une crainte objective (tout de même fondée sur la situation personnelle) de risque selon l'article 97, même si on a conclu que la prétention de crainte subjective n'était pas crédible. Le juge Blanchard a noté la distinction entre les demandes fondées sur l'article 96 et celles fondées sur l'article 97 et il a dit que, même si le fondement probatoire pouvait être le même, les demandes devaient être traitées de façon distincte. Mais surtout, pour les besoins de l'affaire qui nous occupe, il a dit: « La question de savoir si la Commission a valablement examiné les deux revendications doit être tranchée, en tenant compte des éléments différents qui sont requis pour démontrer le bien-fondé de chacune, en fonction des faits d'espèce. » Même si la Commission avait commis une erreur en ne faisant pas une analyse particulière de la demande selon l'article 97, son erreur avait peu d'incidence sur le dénouement de l'affaire.
[14]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Mosley a dit ceci au paragraphe 27:
À mon avis, la Commission dans la présente affaire n'a pas examiné la documentation sur le pays et les autres éléments de preuve touchant les conditions dans les prisons en Turquie et elle a omis d'examiner la question de savoir si le demandeur pouvait avoir la qualité de « personne à protéger » s'il était renvoyé dans ce pays compte tenu de la possibilité qu'il soit exposé à une [traduction] « sentence sévère d'emprisonnement » pour s'être soustrait au service militaire en Turquie. Malgré les conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité tirées par la Commission, une analyse distincte, dans le sens de celle effectuée dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, compte tenu du libellé de l'article 97, aurait pu amener à conclure que M. Kilic avait la qualité de personne à protéger. Ainsi, la conséquence de l'erreur commise par la Commission est inconnue et, par conséquent, la présente demande devrait être renvoyée à la Commission afin que, pour ce motif, cette dernière statue à nouveau sur l'affaire.
Il est évident que dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, on a omis, dans l'analyse faite selon l'article 96, d'examiner certains éléments de preuve qui auraient dû l'être en vertu de l'article 97.
[15] Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge von Finckenstein a conclu que la décision défavorable de la Commission sur la crédibilité était étayée par les faits et que l'omission de faire une analyse selon l'article 97 n'avait pas d'incidence sur l'issue de la cause, faute de preuve.
[16] Le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a décidé que la Commission n'avait pas commis d'erreur en tirant une conclusion défavorable sur la crédibilité. Puisque la demande était fondée uniquement sur des motifs de la Convention (l'origine ethnique et l'appartenance à un groupe social particulier), les analyses de la Commission sur la crédibilité et le risque ont suffi pour justifier le refus d'accorder le statut de réfugié. Le juge Gibson a de plus conclu que le demandeur n'était pas une personne à protéger parce que, à part un motif visé par la Convention, aucun autre motif à l'appui du besoin de protection n'avait été mis de l'avant. Bien qu'on ait pu espérer une explication plus détaillée de la décision de la Commission relativement à l'article 97, ce manquement ne constituait pas une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[17] À mon avis, cette jurisprudence n'exige pas qu'une analyse selon l'article 97 soit faite dans tous les cas. Plutôt, une analyse sera exigée dans certains cas. C'est une question qui doit être examinée au cas par cas. Si des éléments de preuve à l'appui d'une analyse des risques visés à l'article 97 sont soumis à la Commission, alors l'analyse doit être faite.
[18] Donc, même si une analyse distincte selon l'article 97 est souhaitable, l'omission de faire une telle analyse ne sera pas fatale dans des circonstances où aucun élément de preuve ne l'exigerait. Dans l'affaire qui nous occupe, il n'existait pas d'autres motifs à l'appui d'une conclusion que la demanderesse avait qualité de personne à protéger et, pour Mme Brovina, l'analyse du risque a été faite dans le contexte de la protection des réfugiés. De plus, la Commission a effectivement fait une brève analyse du risque visé à l'article 97 lorsqu'elle a tiré la conclusion qu' « il n'existe aucune raison de croire » que Mme Brovina fera face à quelque risque que ce soit si elle rentre en Albanie. La Commission ne disposait d'aucun élément de preuve objectif qui lui aurait permis de tirer une autre conclusion.
[31]
Le jugement <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, a également été pris en compte dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, où le juge Martineau a déclaré ce qui suit:
[13] Les demandeurs renvoient à la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, quant à la proposition selon laquelle l'article 97 doit être examiné à la lumière de chaque cas. La conclusion tirée dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, a été que le fait de ne pas examiner spécifiquement le risque objectif dont il est question à l'article 97 peut constituer soit une erreur pouvant faire l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire, soit une erreur peu importante selon la preuve déposée et cette décision doit être prise au cas par cas.
[14] Le juge Blanchard a de plus conclu que dans les circonstances particulières de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, l'omission d'analyser spécifiquement la revendication fondée sur l'article 97 ne constituait pas une erreur pouvant faire l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire:
Mis à part les éléments de preuve déclarés non crédibles par la Commission, il n'y en avait pas d'autres dont celle-ci disposait et découlant de la documentation sur le pays ou de toute autre source qui auraient pu conduire la Commission à conclure que le demandeur était une personne à protéger. Dans ces circonstances, je conclus que la Commission a bien commis une erreur en omettant d'analyser spécifiquement la revendication fondée sur l'article 97. Je conclus toutefois également, exerçant à cet égard mon pouvoir discrétionnaire, que cette erreur n'a pas d'effet déterminant sur l'issue de l'affaire.
[32]
La Cour a ensuite ajouté que, dans la jurisprudence subséquente, il a été conclu que le défaut de faire une analyse distincte en vertu de l'article 97 peut faire ou non l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire selon les circonstances, et que « [l] a distinction dépend expressément de la nature de la preuve présentée dans l'affaire » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 16).
[33]
En l'espèce, je dois déterminer si la SPR a commis une erreur susceptible de révision en ne faisant pas une analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 96. La SPR déclare dans sa décision qu'il n'était pas probable que le demandeur subisse un grave préjudice en raison de l'engagement de son frère dans le Mossad s'il retournait au Liban, et rejette la demande présentée en vertu des articles 96 et 97.
[34]
À mon avis, bien que la SPR ne précise pas dans sa décision qu'elle a fait une seule analyse combinée fondée à la fois sur l'article 96 et sur l'article 97, elle aurait été en droit de le faire dans les circonstances. Toutefois, même si la SPR aurait dû faire une analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 96, et qu'elle ne l'a pas fait, cela n'a pas influé sur sa conclusion et ne constitue pas une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[35]
J'en arrive à cette conclusion en me fondant essentiellement sur la preuve qui a été présentée à la SPR. En ce qui concerne l'association du frère du demandeur avec le Mossad, le demandeur n'a pas précisé dans son FRP le groupe social duquel il prétendait être membre ou à l'égard duquel il éprouvait une crainte fondée de persécution. Il en est question dans l'énoncé des faits annexé où il déclare ceci:
[traduction]
Au Liban, le Hezbollah et ses alliés et les autorités libanaises me puniront d'avoir servi comme caporal dans l'armée du Liban du Sud, de m'être rendu en Israël et d'avoir un frère nommé Ramzi qui a travaillé pour le Mossad. Ils me tortureront jusqu'à ce que je leur avoue l'ampleur de ma participation dans l'ALS et l'armée israélienne et de l'implication de Ramzi dans le Mossad. En mai 2000, après le retrait d'Israël, les membres de ma famille immédiate ont été détenus et interrogés par le Hezbollah au sujet de mes allées et venues et de celles de Ramzi parce que nous étions recherchés par le Hezbollah. [...] Je ne serai pas en sécurité au Liban en raison de mon association passée avec l'ALS. De plus, la participation de mon frère Ramzi aux activités du Mossad israélien met ma vie en danger au Liban. Mon frère s'est enfui en Allemagne, où il a obtenu l'asile et la citoyenneté.
[36]
Cette question n'a pas été soulevée à l'audience devant la SPR si ce n'est d'une observation qu'a faite l'avocat du demandeur à l'issue de l'audience et selon laquelle même si la SPR n'avait pas retenu la preuve de la participation du demandeur dans l'ALS, [traduction] « le fait que le frère du demandeur, Ramsi, était membre du Mossad mettait la vie du demandeur à risque qu'il ait ou non servi dans l'Armée du Liban-Sud ». L'avocat a poursuivi sa pensée au sujet du Hezbollah:
[traduction]
[...] c'était une situation dangereuse pour lui et il existe une possibilité raisonnable qu'il soit kidnappé et torturé tout simplement pour pousser son frère à se rendre, son frère qui travaillait pour le Mossad israélien et qui aurait détenu des informations que le demandeur n'aurait pas connues, lui-même n'étant que simple soldat. Mais un membre du Mossad aurait été bien plus utile à l'Hezbollah. Cette situation était donc dangereuse pour lui. [...]
[37]
Étant donné cette observation donnée de vive voix par l'avocat lors de l'audience, la SPR a demandé au demandeur de présenter des observations par écrit au sujet de l'article 97. Voici comment ces observations ont été traitées dans la décision:
[13] Après l'audience, le conseil du demandeur d'asile a présenté des observations écrites pour que la demande d'asile soit acceptée suivant l'article 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
(LIPR). Comme le frère du demandeur d'asile a fait partie du Mossad et a été reconnu comme réfugié en Allemagne, le conseil est d'avis que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur d'asile sera exposé au risque de torture ou à une menace à sa vie étant donné que le Hezbollah s'intéressera à lui pour recueillir des renseignements concernant son frère Ramzi.
[14] La soeur du demandeur d'asile est également la soeur de Ramzi et elle a vécu continuellement au Liban-Sud. Rien ne prouve qu'elle ait eu des problèmes quelconques avec le Hezbollah. Par conséquent, je suis convaincu qu'il n'est pas probable que le demandeur d'asile subisse un grave préjudice en raison de l'engagement de son frère dans le Mossad s'il retournait au Liban aujourd'hui.
[38]
La SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible et a rejeté la preuve de son engagement militaire dans l'ALS. Elle a accepté l'allégation du demandeur voulant que son frère avait participé aux activités du Mossad et a effectué une autre analyse de cet aspect de la question en se fondant sur l'article 97. Toutefois, la SPR a conclu que le risque allégué par le demandeur n'était pas fondé parce que rien ne prouvait que les autres membres de sa famille, et en particulier sa soeur qui vivait au Liban du Sud, avaient été persécutés par le Hezbollah à cause de l'association du frère avec Mossad.
[39]
La SPR a conclu qu'il n'était pas probable que le demandeur subisse un préjudice en raison des activités de son frère. Bien que tirée par suite de l'analyse fondée sur l'article 97, cette conclusion impliquait aussi que le demandeur ne pouvait pas, à la lumière des mêmes éléments de preuve, satisfaire à la norme de preuve prescrite dans le cadre d'une analyse fondée sur l'article 96. Autrement dit, en l'absence de toute preuve au dossier susceptible d'établir que la crainte de persécution du demandeur était fondée, la SPR n'était pas tenue de procéder à une analyse distincte ou additionnelle fondée sur l'article 96. En outre, même si elle l'avait fait, cette absence d'éléments probants aurait empêché le demandeur de prouver à la fois qu'il éprouvait à raison un crainte de persécution et qu'il était lié à un groupe social donné, en l'occurrence sa famille, dont nous traiterons ci-après.
[40]
La jurisprudence de la Cour et celle de la Cour d'appel fédéral établissent que l'appartenance à une famille peut tenir d'appartenance à un groupe social aux fins d'une demande d'asile, mais le fait qu'un membre de la famille ait été persécuté ne donne pas à tous les autres membres de la famille la qualité de réfugié (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Comme l'a déclaré le juge Mosley dans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 9:
[8] La loi exige qu'un demandeur d'asile prouve qu'il existe un lien personnel entre lui et la persécution qu'il allègue fondée sur l'un des motifs prévus à la Convention. Par conséquent, la persécution indirecte n'est pas un fondement solide pour la revendication du statut de réfugié au sens de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 2164 (QL).
[9] La reconnaissance de la famille comme groupe social aux fins d'une demande d'asile est bien établie dans la jurisprudence. Dans les cas où la demande d'asile est fondée sur l'appartenance à un groupe familial, il faut démontrer l'existence d'un lien personnel entre le demandeur et la persécution qui aurait été exercée pour un motif prévu à la Convention:
Pour-Shariati
, susmentionné. Il n'est pas suffisant de faire valoir la persécution subie par des membres de la famille s'il est peu probable que le demandeur soit directement touché. En l'espèce, il existe un lien suffisant entre la demande d'asile du demandeur et la persécution subie par sa femme et sa fille. Le demandeur est le mari et le père des femmes et, par conséquent, la décision de ne pas faire exciser sa fille lui ferait directement courir un risque.
[41]
Dans la décision
Granada
, précitée, le juge Martineau précise au paragraphe 16 le type de preuve qui doit accompagner les demandes présentées en vertu de l'article 96 de la LIPR:
[16] La famille peut être considérée comme un groupe social uniquement dans les cas où certains éléments de preuve indiquent que la persécution vise les membres de la famille en tant que groupe social:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] A.C.F. no 657 (C.F. 1re inst.) (QL). Cependant, l'étendue du principe de l'assimilation de la famille à un groupe social n'est pas illimitée; la famille en question doit elle-même, en tant que groupe, être l'objet de représailles et de vengeance. En d'autres termes, les demandeurs doivent être ciblés et visés simplement parce qu'ils sont membres de la famille, même s'ils ne se sont jamais mêlés de politique eux-mêmes et ne le feront jamais
(Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) (QL)
.
[...]
[42]
Compte tenu de cette jurisprudence, il est évident que le demandeur ne s'est pas convenablement déchargé du fardeau qui lui incombait d'établir qu'il éprouvait une crainte fondée de persécution qui aurait pu lui valoir la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention du fait de son appartenance à la famille de son frère. Rien ne prouvait que d'autres membres de la famille risquaient la persécution ou que le demandeur risquait aussi d'être persécuté du fait de l'association de son frère avec le Mossad. Plutôt, comme l'indique la SPR dans sa décision, la preuve établissait que la soeur du demandeur avait toujours vécu au Liban du Sud et que le Hezbollah ne lui avait jamais causé de difficultés. Aussi aucune analyse distincte de la preuve selon l'article 96 ne s'imposait.
[43]
Pour conclure, il y a lieu de faire preuve de retenue à l'égard de la SPR dans sa décision de procéder à des analyses distinctes ou à une analyse intégrée des demandes présentées à la fois en vertu de l'article 96 et de l'article 97. En l'espèce, l'intention de la SPR n'est pas claire. Toutefois, bien qu'une explication de la décision de la SPR au regard de la demande présentée en vertu de l'article 96 aurait été souhaitable, le fait de ne pas l'avoir dans les circonstances de l'espèce n'est pas fatal.
[44]
Les éléments de preuve étaient en l'espèce communs aux deux demandes, et aucun autre élément de preuve ne justifiait une analyse distincte. Plus précisément, à défaut de preuve appuyant l'allégation du demandeur selon laquelle il risquait d'être persécuté en raison de l'association de son frère avec le Mossad ou en raison de ses opinions politiques présumées, le demandeur ne pouvait pas s'acquitter du fardeau qui lui incombait de prouver ses allégations fondées sur les articles 96 ou 97. Par conséquent, même si la SPR avait fait erreur en n'effectuant pas une analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 96, ce que je ne crois pas en l'espèce, cette erreur n'est pas sujette à un contrôle judiciaire, car elle n'est pas déterminante de l'issue du dossier.
iii)
Le caractère raisonnable
[45]
Comme il est indiqué dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, le caractère raisonnable est une norme déférente qui tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Pour les raisons susmentionnées, je considère que la décision était raisonnable et qu'elle s'inscrit dans la gamme des issues possibles acceptables en l'espèce.
