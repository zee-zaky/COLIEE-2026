Strickland, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision by the Veteran's Review and Appeal Board (VRAB) dated July 9, 2012. The VRAB refused to reconsider, pursuant to subsection 32(1) of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
, SC 1995, c 18 (VRAB Act), an earlier entitlement appeal decision which denied the Applicant's entitlement to a pension on the basis that the Applicant's new evidence was neither new nor credible.
Background
[2]
The Applicant, Mr. Basil McAllister, served in the Canadian Armed Forces from December 30, 1954 to January 1, 1975. Much of that time was spent working and training at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Gagetown, New Brunswick.
[3]
Agent Orange was sprayed at CFB Gagetown in 1966 and 1967. The Applicant's service records confirm that he performed field training at CFB Gagetown during the summer of 1967.
[4]
In 1994, at the age of 62, the Applicant was diagnosed with adenocarinoma of the prostrate (prostate cancer). On May 19, 2005, the Applicant applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VAC) for disability benefits on the basis that his prostrate cancer was related to his military service, specifically, that it resulted from his exposure to Agent Orange.
[5]
On March 21, 2006, the Applicant's request for a disability pension pursuant to subsection 21(2) of the
Pension Act
, RSC, 1985, c P-6 (
Pension Act
) was denied. The Department of Veterans Affaires (DVA) acknowledged that the Applicant served at CFB Gagetown in one of the known time frames when spraying of Agent Orange occurred and that current medical research supported an association between exposure to Agent Orange and adenocarcinoma of the prostate. However, it found that there was no evidence that the Applicant had been exposed to that substance. The Applicant was advised that the decision could be reviewed on the basis of any new information or evidence that he might provide, and, that he had the option of appealing the decision to the VRAB. The Applicant exercised that option.
[6]
On September 25, 2008 an entitlement review panel of the VRAB upheld the DVA decision (Entitlement Review Decision). The review panel listed the evidence that it considered in making its decision. It was satisfied that studies which arose from a comprehensive review of the Agent Orange test spraying rebutted a presumption of exposure, as the evidence did no more than establish that the Applicant was serving at CFB Gagetown during the relevant time period. Therefore, the Applicant failed to establish that his prostate cancer arose out of or was directly related to his military service.
[7]
The review panel stated that the Agent Orange test spraying occurred in an unused and remote area of the base; flagmen were posted to indicate the designated spray area to helicopters; officers were assigned to ensure the flagmen were in the correct positions; and, according to the research, the two sprayed plots of land were not used again. The Task 3A-1 Tier 1 Report indicated that even for those directly involved with the tests (loaders, pilots, applicators and flagmen) there was no suggestion of an increased risk of long term irreversible health risks. For those who trained near the two sites, the exposure was found to be sufficiently low to indicate no increased risk of dioxin-related illness.
[8]
Accordingly, the panel found that there was no more than a possibility that the Applicant was actually exposed to Agent Orange during his service and that a possibility was insufficient to establish entitlement under the
Pension Act
. Further, even if some exposure occurred, the level of risk attributable to the exposure was insufficient to establish a case for a pension award.
[9]
The Applicant was advised that, pursuant to section 25 of the VRAB Act, if he was dissatisfied with that decision he could appeal to a VRAB board, which he did.
[10]
On August 11, 2009, an entitlement appeal panel of the VRAB upheld the above described VAC decision and the Entitlement Review Decision (Entitlement Appeal Decision). At the entitlement appeal, the Applicant presented additional evidence from Captain James W. Bloomfield (retired) and a report from Dr. Liam Hickey. The appeal panel noted that a pension benefit entitlement had been denied on the basis that there was no evidence that the Applicant had been exposed to Agent Orange and found that the new evidence did not answer the objections raised in the previous decision. That is, the Applicant failed to adduce evidence of direct exposure Agent Orange.
[11]
The appeal panel made particular note of the fact that the entitlement review panel had referred to the Task 3A - Tier 3 Report (in fact, it referenced the Task 3A-Tier 1 report). In addition, the appeal panel noted that the Applicant was diagnosed with prostate cancer when he was 73, while the median age of the diagnosis in the general population is 72 years of age. Further, that the only scientific study on which it could assess the risk of contamination is one sponsored by the Canadian government and that there was no documented evidence to lead the appeal panel to consider that study as not being credible. The appeal panel found that it could not rely on Dr. Hickey's opinion to relate the Applicant's condition to his military service because the opinion was not of probative value. In addition, the statistics in Captain James W. Bloomfield's letter were not in keeping with the conclusion of the study sponsored by the Canadian government. The appeal panel upheld the previous decisions and affirmed that there was no evidence that the Applicant's prostate cancer is related to his military service.
[12]
The Applicant sought a reconsideration of the Entitlement Appeal Decision pursuant to subsection 32(1) of the VRAB Act on the basis of errors of fact and law. On March 29, 2010 a VRAB reconsideration panel affirmed the Entitlement Appeal Decision (First Reconsideration Decision).
[13]
The reconsideration panel acknowledged an error of fact made in the Entitlement Appeal Decision which stated that the Applicant was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 73 when, in fact, he was diagnosed at the age of 62. The reconsideration panel further acknowledged that it could not trace the source of the entitlement appeal panel's statement that the median age for prostate cancer diagnosis in the general population was 72 years old.
[14]
The reconsideration panel did not accept the Applicant's submission that a second error of fact arose because, although he had corroborated his prior evidence with the statements of two witnesses confirming that he had spent a lot of time in the training areas in 1967 immediately after they were sprayed and possibly even during spraying, it understood, according to the "Furlong Report", that the sprayed areas were not accessible for regular training and that only those who were directly exposed may have been at higher risk.
[15]
As to the Applicant's submissions that these two alleged errors of fact constituted an error of law by erroneously rebutting a presumption arising from subsection 21(3)(g) of the Pension Act that the Applicant's prostate cancer was connected with his military service, the reconsideration panel stated that it could find no support for that contention.
[16]
The reconsideration panel also disagreed with and dismissed the opinion of Dr. Liam Hickey. His opinion was that there was a medical connection between the Applicant's condition and Agent Orange exposure which was consistent with the Department of National Defence (DND) studies. The reconsideration panel stated that there are very specific circumstances where a link can be established and, according to the available evidence, the panel could not find that such a link exists in this case.
[17]
The Applicant also submitted a report from an oncologist, Dr. Michael Sia, that had been prepared for another applicant; a copy of the Chamie Study as well as three similar fact VRAB decisions which awarded pensions to individuals who served with the Applicant at Gagetown and suffered disabilities related to Agent Orange exposure. The reconsideration panel stated that it could not rely on that evidence as circumstances vary from case to case and each case must be decided on its own merits. It concluded that it could find no evidence to indicate that the Applicant was directly exposed to Agent Orange. It upheld the Entitlement Appeal Decision that the Applicant was not entitled to pension benefits.
[18]
Pursuant to subsection 32(1) of the VRAB Act, the Applicant then sought a second reconsideration on the basis of new evidence in the form of two new witness statements. On July 9, 2012 a second reconsideration panel denied the Applicant's request (Second Reconsideration Decision).
[19]
On July 23, 2012 the Applicant filed a Notice of Application seeking judicial review of the Second Reconsideration Decision. It is that decision which is under review by this Court.
Decision Under Review
[20]
In the Second Reconsideration Decision, the VRAB stated that when determining an application for a reconsideration based on new evidence, a four part test prescribed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
R v Palmer
, 106 DLR (3d) 212 (SCC) and adopted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 1646 [
Chief Pensions Advocate
], aff'd in 2007 FCA 298 is to be applied in determining if the evidence should be accepted:
i) the evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at a previous hearing;
ii) the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon the decisive or potentially decisive issue in the adjudication;
iii) the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief, and
iv) the evidence must be such that, if believed, it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.
[21]
The new evidence that the Applicant sought to submit by way of his request for the second reconsideration was:
a) Statement of Gordon A. Gravelle Sgt (R) (Gravelle statement) which stated:
I was Platoon Sgt. of 7 Platoon "C" Company and Sgt. McAllister Basil J. was 12 Platoon "D" Company which was on our right flank when Agent Orange was sprayed on us.
We were ordered before that to put on respirators and ponchos for the attack. This occurred when 2nd Battalion the Black Watch (RHR) of Canada were Enemy Force of 1st Battalion The Black Watch (RHR) of Canada in the summer of 1967.
b) Statement of H. J. Harkes, MC, CD, Lieutenant - Colonel (R) (Harkes statement) that the Applicant was a member of Mr. Harkes' battalion, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), at CFB Gagetown, which was assigned to design and conduct a training program to prepare the 1st battalion of The Black Watch for a six month deployment to Cyprus and that:
The practical phase of the training included a series of field training exercises conducted throughout Gagetown's manoeuvre area ... The training culminated with a major field exercise involving almost every soldier from both battalions in the middle of June 1967 - just days after parts of the training area had been sprayed with 'Agent Orange'. Mr. McAllister, a rifle platoon sergeant at the time, participated in the exercise. Moreover, as an element of the exercise control staff, he would have been in the training area in the weeks prior to the final exercise conduction reconnaissance and making the preparations necessary to ensure that the exercise provided for realistic training.
Although I cannot state that I personally witnessed Mr. McAllister being sprayed or otherwise in contact with 'Agent Orange', I am certain that he would have been in or around the affected area at, and in the days immediately after, the spraying took place.
[22]
The VRAB reasoned that the Applicant had submitted similar evidence in the past. This included a letter of support submitted to the entitlement appeal panel and corroborating letters from two witnesses that were before the first reconsideration panel. The latter letters attested that the Applicant had spent a lot of time in the training area immediately after, and possibly during, the spraying of Agent Orange. The VRAB quoted the statement of the panel in the First Reconsideration Decision that it understood the Furlong Report to contradict this evidence as that report found that the sprayed areas were not accessible for regular training and only those who were directly exposed to Agent Orange were at a higher risk. The VRAB adopted that reasoning.
[23]
The VRAB found that the new evidence which the Applicant sought to submit in the Second Reconsideration was not "new" because the new statements reiterated the same contention. The VRAB stated that with respect to the second part of the test for new evidence, relevance, the statements did not address in a credible manner the decisive point that the Applicant was not directly exposed to Agent Orange. Accordingly, that criterion was not met.
[24]
The VRAB also found that the new evidence was not credible and, therefore, did not meet the third criterion. While the Gravelle statement stated that the Applicant's platoon was on his "right flank when Agent Orange was prayed on us", the VRAB stated that, based on the Furlong Report, it understood that Agent Orange was never sprayed in training areas, but only in remote areas where no training was held. Further, the Harkes statement did not provide any evidence of direct exposure to Agent Orange and his recollection was also not in keeping with the Furlong Report.
[25]
The VRAB concluded that the tendered evidence was not new or credible and would not, when taken with the earlier adduced evidence, be expected to affect the result. As the Applicant did not meet the criteria in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the VRAB declined to reopen the otherwise final and binding Entitlement Appeal Decision for reconsideration.
Issues
[26]
The Applicant is a self-represented litigant. While he does not explicitly identify issues, his Notice of Appeal, Memorandum of Fact and Law and oral submissions suggest that to him the issues are whether the Board erred: in denying his entitlement to a pension, particularly as others who served with him at CFB Gagetown are receiving that benefit; in the discounting of all other evidence in favour of the Furlong Report; and, in the assessment of the credibility of his proposed new evidence.
[27]
In its written submissions, the Respondent identifies the issue as being whether the VRAB's decision that the Applicant is not entitled to a pension under subsection 21(2)(a) of the
Pension Act
is reasonable. However, when appearing before me, the Respondent submitted that the issue was limited to the reasonableness of the Second Reconsideration Decision.
[28]
In my view, the issues are as follows:
a) What is the standard of review for a reconsideration decision of a VRAB appeal panel?
b) Did the VRAB err by refusing to admit the new evidence and, as a result, in declining to reconsider the Entitlement Appeal Decision?
Submissions and Analysis
Standard of Review
[29]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 57 held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 18).
[30]
Prior jurisprudence has held that the standard of review for a reconsideration decision of a VRAB panel is reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Bullock
] at paras 11-13;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 15 and 17;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The question of whether an appeal panel gave proper effect to section 39 of the VRAB Act also attracts a standard of reasonableness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 13. Thus, the standard of review in this case is reasonableness.
[31]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility of the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47;
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 59). Put otherwise, the Court should only intervene if the decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47).
[32]
On a judicial review the Court must show considerable deference to decisions rendered by a VRAB appeal panel that refuses to reconsider its own decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Furlong
] at para 14).
Did the VRAB err in refusing to admit the new evidence
and, as a result, in declining to reconsider the Entitlement Appeal Decision?
Applicant's Position
[33]
The Applicant submits that the VRAB has granted disability pensions for prostate cancer, and other medical conditions attributable to exposure to Agent Orange, to comrades with whom he served side by side at CFB Gagetown during the relevant time frame.
[34]
He submits that the common theme of the VRAB refusals is an alleged lack of evidence that he was directly exposed to Agent Orange during his military service. Yet, in nine other decisions of the VRAB where claimants were found to be entitled to pension benefits, only one, a flagman, was directly sprayed with "Agent Orange".
[35]
The Applicant submits that the VRAB inappropriately denied his admission of new evidence by giving undue weight to some evidence at the expense of other evidence that was favourable to his claim. He states that the VRAB continues to deny his application solely on the basis of the "Furlong Report", which contains errors and which the VRAB has interpreted incorrectly. Specifically, according to the VRAB, based on the "Furlong Report", Agent Orange was never sprayed in training areas, but only in remote areas where training was not conducted. This is incorrect and is also not in keeping with what the Furlong Report actually states.
[36]
The evidence of those who were actually in service at CFB Gagetown is not only credible, but is better evidence and should be preferred. The Applicant submits that any and all evidence he produces as to his exposure to Agent Orange is rejected by the VRAB because it has interpreted the Furlong Report to contradict the Applicant's contention. Section 3 and 39 of the Act requires the VRAB to draw from all of the evidence every reasonable inference in favour of the Applicant and to resolve any doubt in his favour when weighing his evidence.
[37]
The Applicant states that the new evidence should change the result because it further corroborates his exposure to Agent Orange at Gagetown during the summer of 1967. The Gravelle statement confirms that his battalion, flanked by Mr. McAllister's, was sprayed with Agent Orange. The Harkes statement confirms that their training culminated with a major field exercise just days after part of the training area had been sprayed with Agent Orange. As such, the evidence raises a doubt, as contemplated by Sections 3 and 39 of the Act, that the Applicant's disability was related to his service that should be resolved in his favour. The Applicant states that he is therefore, entitled to a pension pursuant subsection 21(2) of the Pension Act.
Respondent's Position
[38]
The Respondent acknowledges that the Applicant served in the 1st Battalion, The Black Watch (RHR) and that he participated in the field training program at CFB Gagetown's manoeuvre area in preparation for a peacekeeping deployment to Cyprus. The Respondent also acknowledges that during the summers of 1966 and 1967 the Applicant performed field training exposing him to long transits on foot, rolling, crawling and digging on and in the ground, and, accepts that he performed field duties at CFB Gagetown between June 14-16, 1966 and June 21-24, 1967 when Agent Orange was sprayed.
[39]
The Respondent submits that it was reasonable for the VRAB to conclude that the new evidence was not new or credible. It was not new as the Applicant presented similar evidence making the same contention before the panel in the First Reconsideration Decision. It was not credible as the VRAB found, based on the Furlong Report, that the training areas which had been sprayed with Agent Orange were not in areas in which training was held after the spraying. The VRAB therefore could not accept that the new evidence which contended that Agent Orange had been sprayed at the same time as (and in very close proximity to the area in which) the Applicant was engaging in field exercises.
[40]
The medical evidence did not establish that the Applicant's condition arose out of exposure to Agent Orange sprayed at CFB Gagetown. An individual's mere presence in Gagetown during the testing of Agent Orange does not constitute exposure that would place an individual at an increased risk for long-term, irreversible health effects.
[41]
Section 39 of the Act "does not relieve the pension applicant of the burden of providing on a balance of probabilities the facts required to establish the entitlement to a pension" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 5). Nor does it imply that such evidence must be automatically accepted as an Applicant's claim must be supported by evidence that is credible and reasonable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Tonner
]).
[42]
The Respondent submits that while the VRAB is required to draw every reasonable inference in favour of the Applicant, the facts inferred must be grounded on "more than a mere possibility"
( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Applicant failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that he suffers from a disability resulting from his military service.
Analysis
[43]
This judicial review is of the VRAB's Second Reconsideration Decision refusing to reconsider, on the basis of new evidence, the August 11, 2009 Entitlement Appeal Decision. The Second Reconsideration Decision is the last in a chain of five decisions concerning the pension benefit entitlement sought by the Applicant. Therefore, as a preliminary matter, it is necessary for the Court to determine to what extent it can look to the previous decisions in assessing the decision under review.
[44]
In
Furlong
, above, at para 17, Justice Blanchard stated that the line of demarcation between a decision refusing to reconsider and an earlier decision is unclear because "a reconsideration, by its very nature, requires some hearkening back to the substance of the earlier decision". He quotes Justice Teitelbaum in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, who explained this as follows:
[17] [...]
[...] Effectively
in a reconsideration, the VRAB is required to look backwards to the substance of the earlier decision. In a similar vein, in a judicial review application concerning the VRAB's failure to reconsider an earlier decision, the Court must equally look backwards to the earlier decision.
Thus, the Court in the case at bar cannot decide in a vacuum if the VRAB on June 21, 1996 properly exercised its discretion. The Court must also pay some attention to the earlier decision of the VAB dated January 19, 1994 because it was at issue in the VRAB reconsideration proceeding.
However, I wish to emphasise that it is not for the Court in the current proceeding to conduct a full-fledged judicial review of the January 19, 1994 decision of the VAB. The validity of the earlier decision of January 19, 1994 cannot properly be challenged in a judicial review of the VRAB's June 21, 1996 reconsideration decision.
The Court does not have jurisdiction to overturn the earlier decision. By its very nature, a reconsideration under the auspices of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act is backward looking but there cannot be a point of infinite regression
. [...] [Emphasis in original]
[45]
Justice Blanchard in
Furlong
, above accepted this analysis and concluded, that the Court could not disregard the decisions made prior to the appeal panel's last decision. Although the Court did not have jurisdiction to set aside these earlier decisions because they were not the subject of the judicial review before it, the Court must nevertheless consider them retrospectively to better understand the basis of the decision that is under judicial review.
[46] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, was also followed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 20 which concluded:
[20] Therefore in order for me to assess whether the Board properly exercised its jurisdiction pursuant to s. 111 of the
Act
, I must also look to the earlier decision of the Panel to determine whether any errors of law or fact were made in its assessment of whether the evidence submitted by Mr. Caswell in support of his request for reconsideration was in fact new evidence. In order to determine whether the Board properly assessed the Panel's reasons, the Board has to look at the Panel's reasons. It appears to me that the Court, as the reviewing body of the Board's decision, has to be in the same position as was the Board when it reviewed the Panel's decision, and it cannot do so without also looking at the Panel's reasons. By not doing so, the Court would not have the full understanding of the situation and would not be in a position to make a determination on the merits of the Board's decision.
[47]
Therefore, in this case, the Court must look to the First Reconsideration Decision and Entitlement Appeal Decision to understand the basis of the Second Reconsideration Decision and to determine whether the VRAB made any errors of law or fact in assessing whether the evidence submitted by the Applicant in support of his request for a second reconsideration was, in fact, new evidence.
[48]
On a second preliminary point, it is trite law that in a judicial review application, the Court can only consider the material that was before the panel with respect to the decision under review (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 7). Therefore, and as I advised the Applicant at the hearing, the Court cannot consider the additional documents that he filed but which were not before the VRAB, being his own affidavit dated August 8, 2012 and the affidavit of Mr. David Tucker, CD SGT. (R) dated October 12, 2012.
[49]
As for the merits of this application, pursuant to section 31 of the VRAB Act, the Entitlement Appeal Decision is final and binding. However, the VRAB may reconsider its decision on its own motion if it determines that there was an error of fact and/or law, or, on application if the person making the application alleges that an error was made with respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law or if new evidence is presented to the appeal panel.
[50]
In his Application for Reconsideration pertaining to the second reconsideration, the Applicant indicated that the basis for his application was that there was new evidence. He did not allege an error of fact or law. The Applicant submitted that the VRAB had continued to deny a pension entitlement on the basis that it had not been presented with evidence of his direct exposure to Agent Orange and that the new evidence, the Gravelle and Harkes statement, would substantiate his position.
[51]
Given the basis for the request for reconsideration, the VRAB was correct to apply the four part test for new evidence as described in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. This Court must review the VRAB's application of that test.
[52]
As noted above, the third prong of the test for admissibility of new evidence requires the proposed new evidence to be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief. The VRAB determined that the proposed new evidence, the Gravelle and Harkes statements, both described above, were not credible. In my view, based on the record before me and keeping in mind the context provided by sections 3 and 39 of the VRAB Act, the VRAB erred in finding that the proposed new evidence was not credible because of an apparent contradiction with the "Furlong Report".
[53]
Essentially, the position of the VRAB has been, throughout the Applicant's pension entitlement review and appeal process, that the "Furlong Report" contradicts any evidence of the Applicant's exposure to Agent Orange. According to the VRAB, the Furlong Report stated that the sprayed areas were not accessible for regular training and only those who were directly exposed to Agent Orange may have been at a higher risk. On this basis, the VRAB continued to reject any evidence the Applicant submitted to indicate that he was exposed to Agent Orange.
[54]
However, I am unable to locate a document entitled the "Furlong Report" in the record before me which was, presumably, also the record before the VRAB. The record did contain a web page print out of National Defence and the Canadian Forces entitled "Project Summary Task 2A: The History and Science of Herbicide Use at CFB Gagetown from 1952 to Present"; a "Project Summary Environmental Site Assessment of CFB Gagetown, NB: Task 2B"; a "Plain Language Summary, Fact Finding, Task 3A-1, Tier 1: Human Health Risk Assessment for Historical Exposures to Contaminants Associated with 1966-67 U.S. Defoliant Testing and CFB Gagetown"; a "Plain Language Summary, Fact Finding Task 3A-1, Tier 2: Toxicological Risk Assessment Pertaining to Potential Occupational and Related Exposures Associated with Herbicide Spraying Operations at CFB Gagetown - Tier 2 - Manufacturing Impurities (Contaminants)" (collectively ER - M2 of the Entitlement Review Decision); a "Plain Language Summary Fact Finding Task 3A-2: Human Health Risk Assessment for Current Exposures to Dioxins at CFB Gagetown"; and, a "Report Summary, Fact Finding Task 3A-1, Tier 3" (collectively ER-M3 of the Entitlement Review Decision).
[55]
I am unable to find any specific reference in those documents, or elsewhere in the record, for the proposition relied on by the VRAB that the "Furlong Report" found that the areas sprayed with Agent Orange were not accessible for regular training.
[56]
The Task 3A-1, Tier 1 report referenced in the Entitlement Review Decision states that it focuses on the contaminants in the products tested by the US military in 1966 and 1967. Further, that the US Department of the Army tested military defoliant chemicals on two densely forested areas of land at CFB Gagetown described in detail in Fact Finding Task 2A. As found in the record before me, Task 2A states only that in addition to the yearly herbicide control program in place at CFB Gagetown, "in 1966, 1967 and 1990, small tracts of land
within the ranges and training areas
were used for herbicide trials" (emphasis added). In 1966 and 1967, the Forestry Branch of the Canadian Forest Service conducted trials of certain products and in the same years but in different areas, the US Department of the Army conducted separate trials including testing of Agent Orange, Agent Purple and Agent White.
[57]
The focus of Task 3A-1, Tier 1, as stated in that document, was on the contaminants in the products tested by the US military in 1966 and 1967, dioxins and hexachlorobenzene. Risks were assessed for mixers/loaders, applicators, flaggers, post-application scouts and on-site military trainees. The latter defined as "the military personnel who may have trained
close to
the sprayed areas, during, and after and at the time of spraying" (emphasis added). Despite this definition, section 5.0, titled "Evaluation of Exposure" states that "Military trainees
who trained in the area after the spraying
were assumed to have longer term exposures" (emphasis added). This would also appear to suggest, contrary to the VRAB's finding, that sprayed areas were in fact accessible by military personnel for training.
[58]
With respect to dioxins, in the context of risks from exposures due to "normal activities" the Task 3A-1, Tier 1 report states:
The short-term exposures estimated for the people who were directly involved with the chemical testing (mixer/loaders, pilots, applicators, scouts) do not suggest they would have been at increased risk for long-term, irreversible health affects ...
The longer-term exposures estimated
for military trainees who trained in or near
either the 1966 or 1967 spray areas following the spray applications were low enough that no increased risk of dioxin related illness is predicted. (Emphasis added)
[59]
As to risks from exposure due to "accidents":
Accidents, such as spills or other incidents, may have resulted in higher exposure for some people. These individuals could have had elevated dioxin body burdens following the accident event.
Although the occurrence of accidents during the 1966 and 1967 spray periods remains uncertain, and elevated body burdens do not necessarily mean that individuals would have experienced adverse health effects, further investigation such as body burdens testing or an epidemiology study may be warranted.
[60]
Again, this would at least seem to suggest that military personnel could have trained in or near the 1966 and 1967 Agent Orange spray areas and, therefore, been exposed to the contaminants.
[61]
Because, Fact Finding Task 3A-1, Tier 2 focuses on the contaminants in all herbicides sprayed at CFB Gagetown between 1952 and 2004 (manufacturing impurities) and Task 3A-1, Tier 3 focuses on the active ingredients in all herbicides sprayed at CFB Gagetown between 1952 and the present, it is presumably Fact Finding Task 3A-1, Tier 1, referenced above, that was relevant to the VRAB decisions pertaining to the Applicant.
[62]
Counsel for the Respondent was unable to refer me to a reference within the record stating that sprayed areas were not accessible for regular training. Counsel did refer me to the Task 3A-Tier 1 report definition of "military trainees", referenced above, and suggested that it may be inferred from this that military trainees did not have access to sprayed sites, I do not agree.
[63]
Based on the record before me, the evidence does not support the VRAB assertion that the "Furlong Report" determined that Agent Orange was never sprayed in training areas, but only in remote areas where no training was held. Accordingly, the VRAB's finding that the new evidence was not credible, and therefore not admissible, because as it was contradicted by the Furlong Report, is unreasonable. Further, the excluded evidence is relevant and is such that, if believed, it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced by the Applicant, be expected to have affected the result.
[64]
Accordingly, the VRAB erred in refusing to admit the new evidence and in declining to reconsider the Entitlement Appeal Decision.
[65]
The application is granted, the Second Reconsideration Decision is set aside and the matter is remitted back to a differently constituted panel of the VRAB for redetermination. The Applicant shall have his costs (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) in the amount of $500.00.
JUDGMENT

THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application is granted. The decision of the VRAB dated July 9, 2012 is set aside and the matter is remitted to a differently constituted panel of the VRAB for re-determination. The Applicant shall have his costs in the amount of $500.00.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appel) (le TAC) rendue le 9 juillet 2012. Le TAC a refusé de réexaminer, en application du paragraphe 32(1) de la
Loi sur le Tribunal des anciens combattants (révision et appel)
, LC 1995, c 18 (la Loi sur le TAC), la décision antérieure par laquelle un comité d'appel n'avait reconnu aucun droit à pension au demandeur au motif que les nouveaux éléments de preuve présentés par ce dernier n'étaient ni nouveaux ni crédibles.
Contexte
[2]
Le demandeur, M. Basil McAllister, a servi au sein des Forces armées canadiennes du 30 décembre 1954 au 1er janvier 1975. Pendant une bonne partie de cette période, il a travaillé et suivi des entraînements à la Base des Forces canadiennes (BFC) Gagetown, au Nouveau-Brunswick.
[3]
En 1966 et en 1967, on a pulvérisé de l'agent Orange à la BFC Gagetown. D'après ses dossiers militaires, le demandeur y a suivi un entraînement sur le terrain pendant l'été 1967.
[4]
En 1994, un diagnostic d'adénocarcinome (cancer) de la prostate a été établi à l'égard du demandeur, alors âgé de 62 ans. Le 19 mai 2005, le demandeur a demandé à Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC) de lui verser des prestations d'invalidité au motif que son cancer de la prostate était lié à son service militaire, et plus particulièrement à l'exposition à l'agent Orange.
[5]
Le 21 mars 2006, la demande de pension d'invalidité présentée par le demandeur, en application du paragraphe 21(2) de la
Loi sur les pensions
, LRC 1985, c P-6 (la
Loi sur les pensions
), a été rejetée. Le ministère des Anciens combattants (le MAC) a reconnu que le demandeur avait servi à la BFC Gagetown pendant l'une des périodes connues de pulvérisation d'agent Orange, et que la recherche médicale actuelle étayait l'hypothèse d'un lien entre l'exposition à l'agent Orange et l'adénocarcinome de la prostate. Le ministère a toutefois conclu qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve d'exposition du demandeur lui-même à cette substance. On a informé le demandeur que la décision pouvait faire l'objet d'une révision, sur le fondement des nouveaux renseignements ou éléments de preuve qu'il pourrait fournir, et qu'il lui était ensuite possible d'interjeter appel de la décision alors rendue auprès du TAC. Le demandeur s'est prévalu de ces voies de recours.
[6]
Le 25 septembre 2008, un comité de révision du TAC a confirmé la décision du MAC (la décision du comité de révision). Le comité de révision a fait état des éléments de preuve qu'il avait pris en compte pour rendre sa décision. Il estimait que les études s'appuyant sur une analyse approfondie des tests de pulvérisation de l'agent Orange réfutaient la présomption d'exposition, la preuve ne démontrant rien de plus que la présence du demandeur à la BFC Gagetown pour y effectuer son service pendant la période pertinente. Le demandeur n'avait donc pas établi que son cancer de la prostate était consécutif ou rattaché directement à son service militaire.
[7]
Le comité de révision a déclaré qu'on avait effectué les tests de pulvérisation dans une zone éloignée et inutilisée de la base, que des signaleurs avaient été postés pour faire connaître aux hélicoptères la zone désignée de pulvérisation, que des officiers devaient s'assurer de la présence aux bons endroits des signaleurs et que, d'après les études effectuées, on ne s'était jamais servi après la pulvérisation des deux terrains touchés. Selon le rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 1, rien ne laissait croire que même les personnes ayant participé directement aux tests (les chargeurs, pilotes, applicateurs et signaleurs) couraient un risque accru de problèmes de santé chroniques et irrémédiables. Quant aux personnes ayant suivi un entraînement près des deux sites, le taux d'exposition était suffisamment faible pour qu'on puisse conclure à l'absence d'un risque accru de maladies liées aux dioxines.
[8]
Le comité a par conséquent conclu qu'il n'y avait pas plus qu'une simple possibilité d'exposition véritable du demandeur à l'agent Orange pendant son service, et que cette possibilité ne suffisait pas pour établir son droit à pension sous le régime de la
Loi sur les pensions
. En outre, même s'il y avait eu une certaine exposition, le niveau de risque pouvant lui être attribué ne justifiait pas le versement d'une pension.
[9]
On a fait savoir au demandeur qu'en vertu de l'article 25 de la Loi sur le TAC, il pouvait en appeler de la décision auprès d'un comité du TAC s'il n'en était pas satisfait. Le demandeur a interjeté appel.
[10]
Le 11 août 2009, un comité d'appel du TAC a confirmé la décision d'ACC précédemment décrite ainsi que la décision du comité de révision (la décision du comité d'appel). Dans cet appel, le demandeur a présenté une déposition additionnelle du capitaine (à la retraite) James W. Bloomfield ainsi qu'un rapport du Dr Liam Hickey. Le comité d'appel a relevé que le droit à pension n'avait pas été reconnu parce que rien ne prouvait l'exposition du demandeur à l'agent Orange, et a conclu que les nouveaux éléments de preuve ne réfutaient pas les objections soulevées dans la décision antérieure. Autrement dit, le demandeur n'avait présenté aucune preuve d'exposition directe à l'agent Orange.
[11]
Le comité d'appel a particulièrement relevé que le comité de révision a renvoyé au rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 3 (en fait, c'est la partie 1 que le comité de révision a mentionnée). Le comité d'appel a en outre souligné que le demandeur avait 73 ans lorsque le diagnostic de cancer de la prostate a été posé, et que l'âge médian pour un tel diagnostic était de 72 ans chez la population générale. De plus, la seule étude scientifique permettant au comité d'appel d'évaluer le risque de contamination avait été parrainée par le gouvernement canadien, et aucune preuve documentée ne permettait au comité de croire que cette étude n'était pas crédible. Le comité d'appel a par ailleurs conclu qu'il ne pouvait s'appuyer sur l'avis du Dr Hickey pour faire un lien entre la maladie et le service militaire du demandeur parce que cet avis n'avait aucune valeur probante. Les statistiques figurant dans la lettre du capitaine James W. Bloomfield ne cadraient pas non plus avec la conclusion de l'étude parrainée par le gouvernement canadien. Le comité d'appel a confirmé les décisions antérieures et déclaré qu'aucune preuve n'établissait un lien entre le cancer de la prostate du demandeur et son service militaire.
[12]
Le demandeur a demandé un nouvel examen de la décision du comité d'appel, en application du paragraphe 32(1) de la Loi sur le TAC, en faisant valoir l'existence d'erreurs de fait et de droit. Le 29 mars 2010, un comité de nouvel examen du TAC a confirmé la décision du comité d'appel (la décision du premier comité de nouvel examen).
[13]
Le comité de nouvel examen a reconnu que le comité d'appel avait commis une erreur de fait dans sa décision en déclarant que le diagnostic de cancer de la prostate avait été établi lorsque le demandeur avait 73 ans, tandis qu'en fait, il était alors âgé de 62 ans. Le comité de nouvel examen a de plus reconnu qu'il ne pouvait trouver d'où le comité d'appel tenait que l'âge médian du diagnostic de cancer de la prostate était de 72 ans chez la population générale.
[14]
Le comité de nouvel examen n'a toutefois pas admis, comme le prétendait le demandeur, qu'une deuxième erreur de fait avait été commise. En effet, bien que le demandeur ait corroboré sa preuve antérieure par les déclarations de deux témoins confirmant qu'il avait passé beaucoup de temps dans les zones d'entraînement en 1967, immédiatement après la pulvérisation et peut-être même pendant celle-ci, le comité était d'avis, sur la foi du « rapport Furlong », que l'on n'avait pas eu accès aux zones de pulvérisation pour effectuer l'entraînement courant, et que seules les personnes directement exposées avaient pu courir un risque plus élevé.
[15]
Quant à la prétention du demandeur selon laquelle les deux erreurs de fait alléguées constituaient une erreur de droit, car elles réfutaient erronément la présomption, découlant de l'alinéa 21(3)
g
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
, d'existence d'un lien entre le cancer de la prostate du demandeur et son service militaire, le comité de nouvel examen a déclaré que rien selon lui ne venait l'étayer.
[16]
Le comité de nouvel examen était aussi en désaccord avec l'avis du Dr Liam Hickey et l'a rejeté. Le Dr Hickey a dit estimer qu'il y avait entre la maladie du demandeur et l'exposition à l'agent Orange un lien médical concordant avec les études du ministère de la Défense nationale (MDN). Le comité a déclaré que des circonstances très précises étaient requises pour qu'un lien puisse être établi et qu'au vu de la preuve disponible, ces circonstances n'étaient pas présentes en l'espèce.
[17]
Le demandeur a également produit le rapport rédigé par un oncologiste, le Dr Michael Sia, à l'égard d'un autre demandeur, un exemplaire de l'étude Chamie ainsi que trois décisions portant sur des faits similaires et où le TAC avait accordé une pension à des personnes qui avaient servi aux côtés du demandeur à Gagetown et qui souffraient d'une invalidité attribuable à l'exposition à l'agent Orange. Le comité de nouvel examen a dit ne pas pouvoir s'appuyer sur ces éléments de preuve parce que les circonstances variaient d'une affaire à l'autre, et que chaque cas doit être tranché selon les faits qui lui sont propres. Le comité a conclu qu'aucune preuve ne démontrait l'exposition directe du demandeur à l'agent Orange. Il a confirmé la décision du comité d'appel portant que le demandeur n'avait pas droit au versement de prestations de pension.
[18]
Sur le fondement du paragraphe 32(1) de la Loi sur le TAC, le demandeur a ensuite sollicité un deuxième nouvel examen en faisant valoir comme nouveaux éléments de preuve les déclarations de deux nouveaux témoins. Le 9 juillet 2012, un deuxième comité de nouvel examen a rejeté la demande du demandeur (la décision du deuxième comité de nouvel examen).
[19]
Le 23 juillet 2012, le demandeur a déposé un avis de demande par lequel il sollicitait le contrôle judiciaire de la décision du deuxième comité de nouvel examen. Cette dernière décision fait l'objet du présent contrôle judiciaire.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[20]
Le TAC a déclaré, dans la décision du deuxième comité de nouvel examen, que lorsqu'il s'agissait de se prononcer sur une demande de nouvel examen sur le fondement de nouveaux éléments de preuve, il fallait appliquer le critère en quatre volets prescrit par la Cour suprême du Canada dans
R c Palmer
, 106 DLR (3d) 212 (CSC) et adopté dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF n° 1646 [
Avocat-conseil en chef des pensions
], conf. par 2007 CAF 298, en vue d'établir s'il convenait ou non d'admettre cette preuve:
i) on ne devrait généralement pas admettre une déposition qui, avec diligence raisonnable, aurait pu être produite à une audience précédente;
ii) la déposition doit être pertinente, en ce sens qu'elle doit porter sur une question décisive ou potentiellement décisive quant au sort de la cause;
iii) la déposition doit être plausible, en ce sens qu'on peut raisonnablement y ajouter foi;
iv) la déposition doit être telle que si l'on y ajoute foi, on puisse raisonnablement penser qu'avec les autres éléments de preuve produits au procès, elle aurait influé sur le résultat.
[21]
Le demandeur a tenté de présenter les nouveaux éléments de preuve suivants en soumettant sa demande de deuxième nouvel examen:
a) La déclaration qui suit du sergent à la retraite Gordon A. Gravelle (la déclaration de M. Gravelle):
[traduction]
J'étais sergent de peloton du 7e peloton de la Compagnie C et le sergent Basil J. McAllister faisait partie du 12e peloton de la Compagnie D, qui se trouvait sur notre flanc droit lorsqu'on a pulvérisé l'agent Orange sur nous.
On nous avait ordonné auparavant d'utiliser des appareils de protection respiratoire et de porter des ponchos en vue de l'attaque. Cela est survenu lorsque le 2e Bataillon du Black Watch (RHR) du Canada était la force ennemie du 1er Bataillon du Black Watch (RHR) du Canada à l'été 1967.
b) La déclaration du lieutenant-colonel à la retraite H. J. Harkes, MC, CD (la déclaration de M. Harkes) selon laquelle le demandeur était membre, à la BFC Gagetown, du bataillon de M. Harkes, le Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), que l'on avait chargé de concevoir et de mettre en oeuvre un programme d'entraînement devant préparer le 1er Bataillon du Black Watch à un déploiement de six mois à Chypre, et renfermant les précisions suivantes:
[traduction]
La partie pratique de l'entraînement comportait une série d'exercices sur le terrain menés dans le secteur d'entraînement de Gagetown [...] L'entraînement a été couronné par un important exercice sur le terrain auquel ont participé presque tous les soldats des deux bataillons à la mi-juin 1967 - seulement quelques jours après la pulvérisation d' « agent Orange » sur des parties de la zone d'entraînement. M. McAllister, sergent de peloton de carabiniers à l'époque, a pris part à l'exercice. En outre, en tant que membre de l'état-major de contrôle pour l'exercice, il a dû se trouver dans la zone d'entraînement pendant les semaines précédant l'exercice final à des fins de reconnaissance et en vue des préparatifs requis pour assurer le caractère réaliste de l'entraînement.
Bien que je ne puisse pas déclarer en tant que témoin direct que M. McAllister a été en contact avec l' « agent Orange », ou qu'on a pulvérisé sur lui cette substance, je suis certain qu'il a dû se trouver dans la zone touchée, ou dans ses environs, les jours où on a procédé à la pulvérisation ou les jours qui immédiatement suivi.
[22]
Le TAC a dit estimer que le demandeur avait produit des éléments de preuve semblables dans le passé, notamment une lettre d'appui présentée au comité d'appel et des lettres de corroboration émanant de deux témoins et soumises au comité de premier nouvel examen. On attestait dans ces deux dernières lettres que le demandeur avait passé beaucoup de temps dans la zone d'entraînement immédiatement après, et peut-être même pendant, la pulvérisation d'agent Orange. Le TAC a cité le comité de premier nouvel examen, qui a dit dans sa décision comprendre que le rapport Furlong contredisait cette preuve, comme on y concluait qu'on n'avait pas eu accès aux zones de pulvérisation pour effectuer l'entraînement courant, et que seules les personnes directement exposées à l'agent Orange avaient pu courir un risque plus élevé. Le TAC a souscrit à cette conclusion.
[23]
Le TAC a conclu que les nouveaux éléments de preuve que le demandeur voulait présenter aux fins du deuxième nouvel examen n'étaient pas « nouveaux » parce qu'on y réitérait tout simplement les mêmes prétentions. Le TAC a déclaré qu'en ce qui concernait le second volet du critère applicable aux nouveaux éléments de preuve, soit la pertinence, les déclarations faites n'étaient pas plausibles quant à la question décisive de savoir si le demandeur avait été exposé directement ou non à l'agent Orange. Il n'était donc pas satisfait à ce critère.
[24]
Le TAC a également conclu que les nouveaux éléments de preuve n'étaient pas crédibles, et ne répondaient donc pas au troisième critère. Bien que M. Gravelle ait dit dans sa déclaration que le peloton du demandeur se trouvait [traduction] « sur notre flanc droit lorsqu'on a pulvérisé l'agent Orange sur nous », le TAC a dit estimer, sur la foi du rapport Furlong, que l'agent Orange n'avait jamais pulvérisé dans les zones d'entraînement, mais l'avait plutôt été à des endroits éloignés où l'on ne procédait à aucun entraînement. M. Harkes n'avait non plus fourni aucune preuve d'exposition directe à l'agent Orange dans sa déclaration, et ses souvenirs ne cadraient pas avec les conclusions du rapport Furlong.
[25]
Le TAC a conclu que les éléments de preuve présentés n'étaient ni nouveaux ni crédibles, et qu'ils n'étaient pas tels qu'on puisse penser qu'avec les autres éléments produits précédemment, ils auraient influé sur le résultat. Comme le demandeur n'avait pas satisfait aux critères énoncés dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, le TAC a refusé de réexaminer la décision - par ailleurs définitive et exécutoire - du comité d'appel.
Questions en litige
[26]
Le demandeur se représente lui-même. Bien qu'il ne dise pas expressément quelles sont selon lui les questions en litige, son avis d'appel, son mémoire des faits et du droit et ses observations orales donnent à entendre que ces questions sont celles de savoir si le Tribunal a refusé erronément de reconnaître son droit à pension - compte tenu particulièrement du fait que d'autres ayant servi en même temps que lui à la BFC Gagetown ont reçu une pension -, a fait abstraction, à tort, de tous les éléments de preuve autres que le rapport Furlong, et a évalué erronément la crédibilité des nouveaux éléments de preuve qu'il avait proposés.
[27]
Selon les observations écrites du défendeur, la question en litige serait de savoir si le TAC a décidé de manière raisonnable que le demandeur n'avait pas droit à une pension aux termes de l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
. Lorsqu'il a comparu devant moi, le défendeur a toutefois fait valoir que seul le caractère raisonnable de la décision du deuxième comité de nouvel examen était en litige dans la présente affaire.
[28]
À mon avis, les questions à trancher sont les suivantes:
a) Quelle norme de contrôle s'applique-t-elle à la décision relative à un nouvel examen d'un comité d'appel du TAC?
b) Le TAC a-t-il commis une erreur en refusant d'admettre les nouveaux éléments de preuve et, en conséquence, de réexaminer la décision du comité d'appel?
Observations et analyse
Norme de contrôle
[29]
La Cour suprême du Canada a déclaré, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 57, que l'analyse de la norme de contrôle n'a pas besoin d'être effectuée dans tous les cas. En fait, lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à une question précise qui lui est soumise est bien arrêtée par la jurisprudence, la cour chargée du contrôle peut adopter cette norme (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 18).
[30]
Selon la jurisprudence, la raisonnabilité est la norme de contrôle applicable à la décision d'un comité du TAC relative à un nouvel examen (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Bullock
], aux paragraphes 11 à 13;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], aux paragraphes 15 et 17;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La question de l'application appropriée de l'article 39 de la Loi sur le TAC par un comité d'appel commande également la norme de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 13). Ainsi, la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à l'espèce est celle de la décision raisonnable.
[31]
Lors du contrôle d'une décision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse a trait « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47;
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Autrement dit, la Cour n'interviendra que si la décision est déraisonnable, c'est-à-dire si elle n'appartient pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47).
[32]
Lors d'un contrôle judiciaire, la Cour doit faire preuve d'une grande retenue à l'égard de toute décision d'un comité d'appel du TAC de ne pas réexaminer l'une de ses décisions (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Furlong
], au paragraphe 14).
Le TAC a-t-il commis une erreur en refusant d'admettre les nouveaux éléments de preuve et, en conséquence, de réexaminer la décision du comité d'appel?
Position du demandeur
[33]
Le demandeur fait observer que le TAC a accordé des pensions d'invalidité, à des camarades ayant servi à ses côtés à la BFC Gagetown à l'époque pertinente, pour des cancers de la prostate ou d'autres problèmes de santé attribuables à l'exposition à l'agent Orange.
[34]
Selon le demandeur, le thème commun des refus opposés par le TAC est le prétendu manque de preuve quant à son exposition directe à l'agent Orange pendant son service militaire. Pourtant, dans neuf autres décisions où le TAC a conclu que les demandeurs avaient droit à une pension, l'agent Orange n'avait été pulvérisé directement que sur un seul d'entre eux, un signaleur.
[35]
Le demandeur soutient que le TAC a refusé de façon inappropriée d'admettre ses nouveaux éléments de preuve en accordant un poids indu à certains éléments aux dépens d'autres qui étayaient sa demande. Le demandeur déclare que le TAC continue de rejeter sa demande uniquement sur le fondement du « rapport Furlong », qui renfermerait des erreurs et que le TAC aurait incorrectement interprété. Le TAC a plus précisément conclu, sur la foi de ce rapport, qu'on n'avait jamais pulvérisé d'agent Orange dans les zones d'entraînement, cette substance n'ayant été utilisée que dans des endroits éloignés où aucun entraînement n'avait lieu. Or, cela serait inexact et ne cadrerait pas avec ce qui est véritablement déclaré dans le rapport Furlong.
[36]
Non seulement les dépositions des personnes qui ont véritablement fait leur service à la BFC Gagetown sont crédibles, mais encore elles constituent une meilleure preuve, qu'il faudrait préférer. Selon le demandeur, le TAC rejette tous les éléments de preuve qu'il produit quant à son exposition à l'agent Orange parce que, selon son interprétation, le rapport Furlong contredit ses prétentions. Aux termes des articles 3 à 39 de la Loi, le TAC doit tirer de l'ensemble des éléments de preuve qui lui sont présentés les conclusions les plus favorables possible au demandeur et trancher toute incertitude en sa faveur.
[37]
Le demandeur déclare que les nouveaux éléments de preuve devraient influer sur le résultat, puisqu'ils corroborent son exposition à l'agent Orange à Gagetown pendant l'été 1967. Dans sa déclaration, M. Gravelle confirme que de l'agent Orange a été pulvérisé sur son bataillon, alors qu'il flanquait celui de M. McAllister. Dans sa déclaration, M. Harkes confirme pour sa part le fait que leur entraînement a été couronné par un important exercice sur le terrain seulement quelques jours après la pulvérisation d'agent Orange dans une partie de la zone d'entraînement. La preuve soulève ainsi une incertitude quant à l'existence d'un lien entre l'invalidité du demandeur et son service militaire, qu'il faudrait trancher en faveur du demandeur conformément aux articles 3 et 39 de la Loi. Le demandeur affirme qu'il a donc droit à une pension en vertu du paragraphe 21(2) de la
Loi sur les pensions
.
Position du défendeur
[38]
Le défendeur reconnaît que le demandeur a servi au sein du 1er Bataillon du Black Watch (RHR) et qu'il a pris part, dans le secteur d'entraînement de la BFC Gagetown, aux activités d'un programme de formation sur le terrain en vue du déploiement de soldats de maintien de la paix à Chypre. Le défendeur reconnaît également qu'au cours de l'été, en 1966 et en 1967, le demandeur a effectué sur le terrain de l'entraînement qui l'a obligé, pendant de longues périodes, à marcher, rouler, ramper sur le sol ainsi qu'à creuser le sol, et il reconnaît que le demandeur travaillait sur le terrain à la BFC Gagetown, du 14 au 16 juin 1966 et du 21 au 24 juin 1967, au moment où on y a pulvérisé de l'agent Orange.
[39]
Le défendeur soutient toutefois qu'il était raisonnable de la part du TAC de conclure que les nouveaux éléments de preuve n'étaient en fait ni nouveaux, ni crédibles. Ils n'étaient pas nouveaux puisque le demandeur avait présenté au premier comité de nouvel examen une preuve semblable où étaient formulées les mêmes prétentions. Ils n'étaient pas crédibles puisque le TAC avait conclu, sur la foi du rapport Furlong, qu'il n'y avait pas eu d'entraînement après la pulvérisation dans les zones d'entraînement pulvérisées d'agent Orange. Le TAC ne pouvait donc pas admettre les nouveaux éléments de preuve par lesquels on prétendait que la pulvérisation avait eu lieu au moment même (et très près du lieu) où le demandeur s'adonnait à des exercices sur le terrain.
[40]
La preuve médicale ne démontrait pas que le problème de santé du demandeur découlait de la pulvérisation d'agent Orange à la BFC Gagetown. La simple présence d'une personne à Gagetown pendant la mise à l'essai de l'agent Orange ne constitue pas une exposition lui faisant courir un risque accru de problèmes de santé chroniques et irrémédiables.
[41]
L'article 39 de la Loi « ne dispense pas le demandeur de la charge d'établir par prépondérance de la preuve les faits nécessaires pour ouvrir droit à une pension » (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 5). Il n'en découle pas non plus l'obligation d'admettre automatiquement la preuve présentée, la demande d'un demandeur devant être étayée par une preuve crédible et raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Tonner
] ).
[42]
Le défendeur fait valoir que, bien que le TAC soit tenu de tirer les conclusions les plus favorables possible au demandeur, les conclusions de fait tirées doivent se fonder sur « davantage qu'une simple possibilité » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Or, le demandeur n'a pas établi par prépondérance de la preuve qu'il souffre d'une invalidité découlant de son service militaire.
Analyse
[43]
Le présent contrôle judiciaire vise la décision du deuxième comité de nouvel examen du TAC de refuser de réexaminer, sur le fondement des nouveaux éléments de preuve soumis, la décision du 11 août 2009 du comité d'appel. La décision du deuxième comité de nouvel examen est la dernière d'une série de cinq décisions concernant le droit à la pension revendiqué par le demandeur. À titre de question préliminaire, il est donc nécessaire que la Cour établisse dans quelle mesure il lui est possible de prendre en compte les décisions antérieures pour évaluer la décision qui fait l'objet du contrôle.
[44]
Dans la décision
Furlong
, précitée, le juge Blanchard a déclaré (au paragraphe 17) que la ligne de démarcation entre la décision de refuser de réexaminer et une décision antérieure ne se tirait pas clairement puisqu'il « est de la nature même d'un réexamen de réexaminer rétrospectivement le fondement d'une décision antérieure ». Il a cité le juge Teitelbaum qui a donné à ce sujet, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, les explications suivantes:
[17] [...]
[...] En fait,
dans un réexamen, le Tribunal est tenu d'examiner rétrospectivement le fondement de la décision antérieure. Dans la même ligne de pensée, dans une demande de contrôle judiciaire alléguant l'omission du TAC (R&A) de réexaminer une décision antérieure, la Cour doit également se pencher de façon rétrospective sur cette décision
. Ainsi, en l'espèce, la Cour ne peut décider dans l'abstrait si, le 21 juin 1996, le TAC (R&A) a correctement exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire. La Cour doit également accorder une certaine attention à la décision antérieure du TAAC en date du 19 janvier 1994, parce que celle-ci est contestée dans la procédure de réexamen du TAC (R&A).
Toutefois, je tiens à souligner qu'il n'appartient pas à la Cour, dans la présente instance, d'effectuer un contrôle judiciaire en règle de la décision du 19 janvier 1994 du TAAC. La validité de cette décision du 19 janvier 1994 ne peut à bon droit être contestée dans une procédure de contrôle judiciaire portant sur la décision du TAC (R&A) en date du 21 juin 1996, concernant le réexamen.
La Cour n'a pas compétence pour annuler la décision antérieure. De par sa nature, le réexamen effectué en vertu de la
Loi sur le Tribunal des anciens combattants (révision et appel
)
est de nature rétrospective, mais on ne peut remonter indéfiniment le temps. [...] [Souligné dans l'original.]
[45]
Dans la décision
Furlong
, précitée, le juge Blanchard a souscrit à cette analyse et conclu que la Cour ne pouvait faire abstraction des décisions précédant la dernière décision rendue par le comité d'appel. Même si la Cour n'avait pas compétence pour annuler ces décisions antérieures parce qu'elles ne constituaient pas l'objet du contrôle judiciaire, elle était tout de même tenue de se pencher sur elles de manière rétrospective pour mieux apprécier le fondement de la décision faisant l'objet du contrôle.
[46]
On a également suivi la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], où la Cour a tiré la conclusion suivante, au paragraphe 20:
[20] Par conséquent, pour que je puisse déterminer si le Tribunal a bien exercé sa compétence en vertu de l'article 111 de la Loi, je dois également examiner la décision antérieure rendue par le comité pour vérifier si des erreurs de droit ou de fait ont été commises lorsque la question de savoir si la preuve présentée par M. Caswell, à l'appui de sa demande de réexamen, constituait réellement une nouvelle preuve, a été analysée. Pour décider si le Tribunal a évalué convenablement les motifs du comité, il faut examiner ces motifs. Il me semble que la Cour, à titre d'instance révisionnelle de la décision du Tribunal, doit être dans la même position qu'était le Tribunal lorsqu'il s'est penché sur la décision du comité et elle ne peut l'être sans examiner aussi les motifs du comité. Si elle ne procédait pas ainsi, la Cour n'aurait pas une vision complète de la situation et ne serait pas en mesure de rendre une décision sur le fond.
[47]
En l'espèce, la Cour doit par conséquent examiner la décision du premier comité de nouvel examen et la décision du comité d'appel pour bien comprendre le fondement de la décision du deuxième comité de nouvel examen et établir si le TAC a commis des erreurs de droit ou de fait lorsqu'il a évalué si la preuve soumise par le demandeur au soutien de sa demande d'un deuxième nouvel examen consistait, véritablement, en de nouveaux éléments de preuve.
[48]
Comme deuxième point préliminaire, il est bien établi en droit que, dans une demande de contrôle judiciaire, les seules pièces que la Cour doit considérer sont celles dont le comité disposait pour rendre la décision qui fait l'objet du contrôle (
Première nation d' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 7). Par conséquent et conformément à ce que j'ai dit au demandeur à l'audience, la Cour ne peut prendre en compte les documents additionnels qu'il a déposés mais dont le TAC ne disposait pas, soit son propre affidavit daté du 8 août 2012 et l'affidavit du 12 octobre 2012 du sergent David Tucker, CD, à la retraite.
[49]
Quant à l'examen sur le fond de la présente demande, disons d'abord que la décision du comité d'appel est, aux termes de l'article 31 de la Loi sur le TAC, définitive et exécutoire. Le TAC peut toutefois réexaminer sa décision de son propre chef s'il constate qu'a été commise une erreur de droit, de fait ou de fait et de droit, ou sur demande, si l'auteur de la demande allègue que les conclusions sur les faits ou l'interprétation du droit étaient erronées ou si de nouveaux éléments de preuve lui sont présentés.
[50]
Dans sa demande de réexamen au deuxième comité de nouvel examen, le demandeur a invoqué comme fondement de sa demande l'existence de nouveaux éléments de preuve. Il n'a allégué aucune erreur de fait ou de droit. Le demandeur a fait valoir que le TAC avait continué à refuser son droit à pension au motif qu'on ne lui avait présenté aucune preuve de son exposition directe à l'agent Orange, et que les nouveaux éléments de preuve, soit les déclarations de MM. Gravelle et Harkes, étayeraient ses prétentions.
[51]
Étant donné le fondement de la demande de nouvel examen, le TAC a eu raison d'appliquer le critère en quatre volets relatif aux nouveaux éléments de preuve décrit dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. La Cour doit examiner l'application de ce critère par le TAC.
[52]
Comme je l'ai déjà mentionné, pour satisfaire au troisième volet du critère relatif à l'admissibilité de nouveaux éléments de preuve, il faut que les nouveaux éléments proposés soient plausibles, autrement dit qu'ils soient raisonnablement dignes de foi. Le TAC a conclu que les nouveaux éléments de preuve proposés, les déclarations de MM. Gravelle et Harkes précédemment décrites, n'étaient pas crédibles. Me fondant sur le dossier qui m'a été présenté et en gardant présent à l'esprit les principes se dégageant des articles 3 et 39 de la Loi sur le TAC, j'estime que le TAC a conclu erronément que les nouveaux éléments de preuve proposés n'étaient pas crédibles en raison de leur apparente incompatibilité avec le « rapport Furlong ».
[53]
La position adoptée par le TAC tout au long du processus d'examen et d'appel relatif au droit à pension du demandeur a essentiellement été que le « rapport Furlong » contredisait toute preuve d'exposition du demandeur à l'agent Orange. Selon le TAC, il était déclaré dans le rapport Furlong qu'on n'avait pas eu accès aux zones de pulvérisation pour effectuer l'entraînement courant et que seules les personnes directement exposées avaient pu courir un risque plus élevé. Sur ce fondement, le TAC a continuellement rejeté tous les éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur pour démontrer son exposition à l'agent Orange.
[54]
Je suis toutefois incapable de trouver un document intitulé le « rapport Furlong » dans le dossier qu'on m'a présenté, le même peut-on présumer que celui dont le TAC disposait. Il y avait dans le dossier la version papier d'une page Web de la Défense nationale et des Forces canadiennes intitulée « Sommaire du projet, Tâche 2A: Historique de l'utilisation d'herbicides à la BFC de Gagetown de 1952 à aujourd'hui », le « Sommaire du projet, Tâche 2B: Évaluation environnementale des sites à la BFC de Gagetown, N.-B. »; le « Sommaire du rapport, Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 1: Évaluation des risques pour la santé humaine découlant d'expositions passées à des contaminants associés aux essais américains de défoliants en 1966-1967 à la BFC Gagetown »; le « Sommaire du rapport, Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 2: Évaluation des risques toxicologiques afférents à l'exposition aux opérations de pulvérisation d'herbicides à des fins professionnelles ou connexes, à la BFC Gagetown - Volet 2 - impuretés de la fabrication (contaminants) » (collectivement, ER - M2 de la décision du comité de révision); le « Sommaire du rapport, Tâche d'établissement des faits 3A-2: Évaluation des risques pour la santé humaine liés aux expositions courantes à des dioxines à la BFC Gagetown »; le « Sommaire du rapport, Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 3 » (collectivement, ER-M3 de la décision du comité de révision).
[55]
Je ne puis trouver aucune citation précise, ni dans ces documents ni ailleurs au dossier, étayant la position adoptée par le TAC, selon laquelle le « rapport Furlong » avait conclu que les militaires n'avaient pas eu accès aux zones de pulvérisation d'agent Orange pour effectuer l'entraînement courant.
[56]
Le rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 1, cité dans la décision du comité de révision, indique qu'il met l'accent sur les contaminants se trouvant dans les produits testés par l'armée américaine en 1966 et en 1967. On y déclare aussi que le département américain de la Défense a testé à des fins militaires des produits chimiques défoliants dans deux terrains très boisés à la BFC Gagetown, une description très détaillée en étant donnée dans le rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 2A. Dans ce dernier document, qui figure dans le dossier qui m'a été présenté, il est uniquement indiqué qu'en plus du programme annuel de désherbage mis en œuvre à la BFC Gagetown, « on a procédé à des essais visant à vérifier l'efficacité de différents herbicides sur des petites bandes de terre
des champs de tir du secteur d'entraînement
en 1966, 1967 et en 1990 » (non souligné dans l'original). La Direction des forêts du Service canadien des forêts a mis à l'essai certains produits en 1966 et en 1967, et les mêmes années mais en des lieux différents, le ministère américain de la Défense a lui aussi procédé à des essais distincts, visant notamment l'agent « Orange », ainsi que les agents « Purple » et « White ».
[57]
Dans le document Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 1, tel qu'il y était déclaré, on a mis l'accent sur certains contaminants - dioxines et hexachlorobenzène - se trouvant dans les produits testés par l'armée américaine en 1966 et en 1967. On a évalué les risques courus par les préposés au mélange et au chargement, les applicateurs, les signaleurs, les observateurs pour l'après-application et les militaires en entraînement sur le terrain. On a défini ces derniers comme des « militaires qui peuvent avoir suivi un entraînement
à proximité
des zones de pulvérisation, durant et après la pulvérisation » (non souligné dans l'original). Malgré cette définition, on a déclaré à la section 5.0, intitulée « Évaluation de l'exposition »: « Nous avons par ailleurs supposé que les militaires en entraînement
qui ont participé à des exercices dans cette zone après la pulvérisation
ont subi une exposition de plus longue durée » (non souligné dans l'original). Cela donnerait aussi à croire que, en contradiction avec la conclusion tirée par le TAC, le personnel militaire avait bien accès pour l'entraînement aux zones de pulvérisation.
[58]
Quant aux risques d'exposition aux dioxines dans le cadre des « activités normales », on déclare ce qui suit dans le rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 1:
• Les expositions de courte durée qui ont été estimées pour les personnes ayant participé directement aux essais de produits chimiques (préposés au mélange et au chargement, pilotes, applicateurs, observateurs) ne semblent pas indiquer qu'ils aient couru un risque accru d'effets irréversibles à long terme sur la santé. [...]
• Les expositions de plus longue durée estimées après les pulvérisations
chez les militaires qui se sont entraînés à l'intérieur ou à proximité
des zones de pulvérisation en 1966 ou 1967 étaient assez faibles de sorte qu'aucun risque accru de maladies liées aux dioxines n'est prévu. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[59]
On déclare ce qui suit quant aux risques d'exposition par suite d' « expositions accidentelles »:
• Des accidents, comme des déversements ou d'autres incidents, peuvent avoir exposé certaines personnes à des concentrations plus élevées. Ces personnes pourraient avoir une charge corporelle en dioxines élevée après l'accident.
• Bien qu'on ne soit pas sûr encore s'il y a eu des accidents durant les périodes de pulvérisation en 1966 et 1967 et bien que des charges corporelles élevées ne signifient pas nécessairement qu'il en résulterait des effets indésirables sur la santé, des enquêtes plus poussées, notamment une évaluation de la charge corporelle ou une étude épidémiologique, devraient être effectuées.
[60]
Encore une fois, cela laisserait tout au moins croire que des militaires ont pu faire de l'entraînement dans les zones de pulvérisation de l'agent Orange en 1966 et en 1967, et ainsi être exposés à des contaminants.
[61]
Puisque dans le rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 2, on se penche principalement sur les contaminants dans tous les herbicides pulvérisés à la BFC Gagetown entre 1952 et 2004 (impuretés de fabrication), et dans le rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 3, sur les principes actifs dans tous les herbicides pulvérisés à la BFC Gagetown de 1952 à nos jours, on peut présumer que le document pertinent, aux fins des décisions du TAC relatives au demandeur, a été le rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 1, cité précédemment.
[62]
L'avocate du défendeur n'a pu me renvoyer à aucun document dans le dossier où l'on disait que l'accès aux zones de pulvérisation n'était pas possible pour effectuer l'entraînement courant. L'avocate m'a renvoyée à la définition de « militaires en entraînement » dans le rapport Tâche d'établissement des faits 3a 1, partie 1, précédemment cité, et a laissé entendre qu'on pouvait en déduire que les militaires en entraînement n'avaient pas accès aux zones de pulvérisation. Je ne partage pas son avis.
[63]
Au vu du dossier qui m'a été présenté, la preuve n'étaye pas l'affirmation du TAC selon laquelle on avait conclu dans le « rapport Furlong » que jamais de l'agent Orange n'avait été pulvérisé dans les zones d'entraînement, mais bien seulement dans des endroits éloignés où l'on ne procédait à aucun entraînement. Il était par conséquent déraisonnable de la part du TAC de conclure que les nouveaux éléments de preuve n'étaient pas crédibles, et donc pas admissibles, parce qu'ils étaient contredits par le rapport Furlong. En outre, les éléments de preuve exclus sont pertinents, de sorte que, si l'on y ajoute foi, on peut raisonnablement penser qu'avec les autres éléments de preuve produits par le demandeur, ils auraient influé sur le résultat.
[64]
Par conséquent, le TAC a commis une erreur en refusant d'admettre les nouveaux éléments de preuve, et de réexaminer la décision du comité d'appel.
[65]
La demande est accueillie, la décision du deuxième comité de nouvel examen est annulée et l'affaire est renvoyée à un comité différemment constitué du TAC pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision. Le demandeur a droit aux dépens (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), fixés à 500 $.
