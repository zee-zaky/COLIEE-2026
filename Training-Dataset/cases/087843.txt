[1]
MacKay, J.
: These reasons relate to orders issued this day determining certain jurisdictional issues raised in relation to the plaintiffs' application for orders in the nature of interim and interlocutory injunction.
[2]
The plaintiffs are aboriginal, members of the Chippewas of either the Saugeen Band of Indians or the Nawash Band of Indians, and are direct descendants of the Saugeen Ojibway Nation. They are fishermen, claiming, in their own right, and on behalf of all members of their respective bands, the right to fish for subsistence, including fishing for trade and barter for necessities, which right they claim to have exercised historically, since time immemorial, off the Bruce Peninsula in waters of Lake Huron in the Province of Ontario.
[3]
By statement of claim filed May 5, 1992, the plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants in relation to traditional fishing rights claimed as aboriginal and treaty rights. Relief sought includes a number of declarations, supplementary to one another or as alternatives, concerning the existence of the aboriginal or treaty rights claimed and implications for these rights in light of ss. 35 and 52 of the
Constitution Act
, 1982
, and concerning fiduciary duties said to be owed to the plaintiffs by Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, and by the defendant Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and his delegates. The provincial Minister and officers of his Ministry within a generally described class of "Fishery Officers" are joined as defendants allegedly acting under delegated authority from the defendant Minister of Fisheries and Oceans in failing to protect and indeed interfering with, the plaintiffs' claimed aboriginal and treaty rights contrary to the laws of Canada.
[4]
On the same day as the action was commenced, the plaintiffs also filed a Notice of Motion seeking an interim and an interlocutory injunction, presumably to apply pending trial of the action, restraining interference with the plaintiffs' claimed aboriginal and treaty right to harvest and market fish caught in traditional waters, and restraining enforcement of s. 33 of the
Fisheries Act
and s. 4 of the
Ontario Fishery Regulations
against purchasers of the plaintiffs' fish, in particular four named persons or business enterprises. The injunction orders sought would be directed to:
1) Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, "as contemplated by ... s. 52 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
";
2) the defendant Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, the officials and "fishery officers" of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans;
3) the defendant Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) and officials and conservation officers, "Fishery Officers", of the Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario).
[5]
The application for injunctive relief also seeks leave to abridge the time for service of the Notice of Motion and an order dispensing with compliance with rule 321.1 which provides for filing of an applicant's Record, in accord with paragraph (6) of that rule. When that application came on for hearing on May 7, 1992, the defendant Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) indicated his intention to contest the jurisdiction of this court over that Minister in the action initiated by the plaintiffs. At the same time, jurisdiction was questioned in relation to the defendants described as "Fishery Officers", being unnamed. Counsel for the plaintiffs, counsel for Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada and for the named defendant Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and counsel for the defendant provincial Minister, all agreed on behalf of their respective clients to the terms of an order which adjourned sine die the application for interim and interlocutory injunctive relief, with leave to the plaintiffs to seek a special date or dates for hearing of preliminary issues concerning the court's jurisdiction in relation to the Ontario Minister and in relation to "Fishery Officers", and for hearing the application for an interlocutory injunction. Further, by consent, it was ordered that the plaintiffs' materials already filed constituted an appropriate applicants' motion record for the interlocutory application, and times for filing of any defence were established.
[6]
Thereafter, upon application to the Associate Chief Justice it was ordered that the issues concerning the court's jurisdiction be heard on June 23, 1992. On June 15, 1992, counsel for the defendants Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada) and "Fishery Officers" acting pursuant to the
Fisheries Act
and
Regulations
under the authority of the Federal Minister, submitted an application seeking
1) an order pursuant to rule 419(1)(a), (c) and (f) striking out the federal defendants from the statement of claim, and
2) an order adjourning the hearing of this motion to strike, sine die, to be brought on three clear days notice by the federal defendants for their application to the court to set a special date for hearing the matter; and
3) an order pursuant to rule 419(1)(a), (c) and (f) striking out the federal defendants from the plaintiffs' application for injunctive relief.
Without objection or comment of the plaintiff, the application for the order adjourning hearing of the first of these applications was orally granted and is this day confirmed by written order. The application for the third order, to strike the federal defendants as respondents to the plaintiffs' application for injunctive relief was, by agreement, argued in the federal defendants' response to the plaintiffs' submissions on jurisdictional grounds and dealt with in the reply of the plaintiffs at the hearing of those preliminary issues, to which these reasons relate.
[7]
Following the hearing on preliminary jurisdictional issues the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Motion, without an appropriate supporting affidavit, seeking leave to reopen the hearing, on short notice, to adduce additional evidence. Further hearing on this issue on short notice was objected to by counsel for the federal defendants and counsel for the plaintiffs thereafter advised that the motion would not be pursued, and was, in effect, withdrawn.
The Background
[8]
The background to the action instituted by the plaintiffs and their application for interlocutory injunction orders is that discussions between the plaintiffs or their representatives and the defendant provincial Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario), which commenced in December 1990, had not been satisfactorily concluded by March 1992 when steps were taken on behalf of that Minister which are said to conflict with the plaintiffs' claimed aboriginal and treaty rights. Those discussions are described in the statement of claim as being directed "towards the establishment of a global agreement for the co-management of the fisheries within the traditional fishing grounds of the plaintiffs and to cooperate in the conservation and management of fisheries resources in the aforesaid fisheries". Since December 1990 and through the course of those discussions until the present, the plaintiffs have continued to fish in the waters claimed as traditional waters and to market fish caught, without a licence to do so, until the spring of 1992. Prior to December 1990 they and their predecessors presumably held licences from time to time, if not consistently, for some years, though there is no evidence in the record of the arrangements prevailing before December 1990.
[9]
In February 1992, the Chiefs and Councils of the Saugeen Ojibway Nations Territories, representing the Chippewas of Saugeen and the Chippewas of Nawash, adopted a resolution approving and accepting the Saugeen Ojibway Nations Territories Interim Fishing Regulations, described as for the 1991 Season. Subsequently on March 27, 1992, the A/District Manager of the Owen Sound District, presumably of the Department of Natural Resources (Ontario), by circular letter, said to have been sent to fish buyers in the Owen Sound District, advised as follows:
"Please be advised that pursuant to s. 33 of the
Fisheries Act
and 72 of the
Game and Fish Act
, it is unlawful to purchase fish commercially that were not originally taken by a person holding a commercial fishing licence allowing harvest of that particular species of fish.
"Your assistance is requested again this year in not purchasing fish from unlicensed individuals. Should you require further information or clarification, do not hesitate to contact Brett Hodson, Acting Fish and Wildlife Supervisor, at Owen Sound (519) 376-3860."
[10]
Mr. Tom Howell, one who is a regular buyer of fish from the Chippewas of the Nawash Band, a group here represented by the plaintiff Ralph Akiwenzie, avers that he received the circular letter of March 27, or a similar letter. He refers as well to subsequent conversations with the Fish and Wildlife Supervisor, a provincial officer of the Department of Natural Resources (Ontario), "to the effect that I am unable to buy fish from any unlicensed commercial source and would be charged for doing so". Plaintiffs believe the circular letter quoted above was also received by others who regularly purchased fish from them in the past, including the three other named individuals or firms, in addition to Mr. Howell, whom the plaintiffs seek to protect by interlocutory injunction orders from threatened possible prosecution.
[11]
This gives rise to the action by the plaintiffs and to the claim to relief by way of an interlocutory injunction pending trial of the issues raised. It is averred that the defendant Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) and his departmental officers, acting under authority delegated to them by the defendant federal Minister, have effectively banned sale of fish taken by the plaintiffs in their traditional fishing waters, action said to conflict with the plaintiffs' aboriginal and treaty right to fish, including the right to fish commercially. This is said to create irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, which warrants injunctive relief at this stage, pending trial of the action.
[12]
The plaintiffs submit that this action raises a number of issues that fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court pursuant to ss. 17(1), (4) and (5)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 185, c. F-7 as amended. Those provisions vest in this court concurrent original jurisdiction in cases where relief is claimed against the Crown, where the Crown is or may be under an obligation in respect of which there are or may be conflicting claims, and where relief is sought against any person for anything done or omitted to be done in the performance of the duties of that person as an officer, servant or agent of the Crown. The issues raised by the action are said to include questions relating to aboriginal rights, fishing, Indians and Indian Lands and Treaty rights, federal responsibility for the actions of its agents or servants appointed pursuant to delegations of authority for administrative reasons, the fiduciary responsibility of the federal Crown to Indians, and the provincial authority to regulate sales of fish by aboriginals. I note that jurisdiction of this court in a given case will depend not only on the general nature of issues raised, but also on the particular issues arising from the facts of the case, on the form of relief that is sought, and upon the parties who initiate the proceedings or are impleaded as defendants.
[13]
Counsel for the federal defendants, supported by counsel for the provincial Minister, urged that several of the affidavits in support of the motion, at least in several respects, do not meet the requirements of Federal Court rule 332, that affidavits be confined to matters of fact within the knowledge of the affiant. I note that the rule is qualified in relation to interlocutory motions when statements of belief with the grounds thereof may be admitted. Counsel for the federal defendants urged that in numerous respects the affidavits here presented did not meet the basis for the exception, in that the grounds for expressed belief are not articulated. It is also said that some affidavits are not relevant to the central issue raised by the statement of claim and the motion for injunctive relief, that is, the right of the plaintiffs to sell fish caught, without a licence authorizing sale. For the most part, the questions concerning the nature and relevance of the affidavit evidence, are matters relating to the merits of the application for interlocutory relief, a matter not directly before me, and not argued at the hearing. The hearing and these reasons concern preliminary questions of jurisdiction of this court in relation to the various defendants against whom injunctive relief is sought pending trial, and in the case of the Ontario Minister in relation to his status and that of officers of his department as defendants in the action initiated by the plaintiffs. Thus, for these reasons, for the most part it is assumed the factual base for relief sought is, or will be, established.
[14]
There is one exception. It seems essential to consider for these reasons such evidence as there is of the status of the defendant provincial Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) and officers of his department as delegates of the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, which is said to be the basis on which they are impleaded and on which the interlocutory relief sought is said to be based. I propose to return to this matter after setting out legislative provisions of interest.
Relevant Legislative Provisions
[15]
Statutory provisions here in issue include the following. Under the
Fisheries Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14, as amended:
in s. 2:
"2 'fishery officer' means a person appointed as a fishery officer pursuant to subs. 5(1);
. . . . .
"5(1) The Minister may designate any persons or classes of persons as fishery officers ... for the purposes of this Act and may limit in any manner the Minister considers appropriate the powers that a fishery officer ... may exercise under this Act or any other Act of Parliament.
"5(2) Each fishery officer and fishery guardian shall be provided with a certificate in a form the Minister considers appropriate certifying their designation as such and, where the powers of a fishery officer or fishery guardian are limited pursuant to subs. (1), specifying the powers that the officer or guardian may exercise under this Act or any other Act of Parliament.
. . . . .
"33 No person shall purchase, sell or possess any fish that has been caught in contravention of this Act or the Regulations.
. . . . .
"43 The Governor in Council .. may make regulations ... [inter alia] ...
(a) for the proper management and control of the seacoast and inland fisheries;
. . . . .
(f) respecting the issue, suspension and cancellation of licences and leases;
(g) respecting the terms and conditions under which a licence and lease may be issued."
. . . . .
The
Ontario Fishery Regulations, 1989
, made by the Governor-in-Council under authority of s. 43 of the
Fisheries Act
, provide in part:
"2(1) In these Regulations,
. . . . .
'licence' means a licence referred to in Schedule XV that is issued under the provincial Act; (permis)
. . . . .
'provincial Act' means the Game and Fish Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 182; (Loi provinciale)
'provincial Minister' means the Minister of Natural Resources for Ontario; (ministre provincial)
. . . . .
"2(4) Every licence is subject to the Act and these Regulations.
. . . . .
"3(1) Subject to subs. (2) to (4), these Regulations apply in respect of fishing in the Province of Ontario and of the transporting of live fish taken from the waters of the Province of Ontario.
. . . . .
"4 Unless authorized by the appropriate licence, no person shall
(a) engage in angling or any other means of fishing;
(b) ship or transport or attempt to ship or transport live fish other than bait-fish; or
(c) deposit or attempt to deposit live fish taken from one body of water into another body of water.
. . . . .
"36(1) The Provincial Minister may, in a commercial fishing licence, impose such terms and conditions as are not inconsistent with these Regulations respecting
(a) the waters from which fish may be taken;
(b) the species, size and quantities of fish that may be taken;
(c) the fishing gear that may be used;
(d) the persons who may engage in fishing under the licence;
(e) the loading, landing, handling and transportation of fish; and
(f) the periods and times of day during which fishing may not be conducted.
"36(2) No holder of a commercial fishing licence shall violate any of the terms and conditions of the licence."
Under the
Game and Fish Act
, R.S.O. 1990, c. G.1, s. 72 provides in part:
"(1) No person shall sell, offer for sale, purchase or barter, or be concerned in the sale, purchase or barter, of an Atlantic salmon (also known as Ouananiche) taken from Ontario waters, a smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, maskinonge, brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout or Aurora trout, any part thereof, including the eggs thereof, but subject to such terms and conditions as are prescribed by the Regulations, ... [a sale may be made under the authority of a licence to sell]
"(2) No person shall sell, offer for sale, purchase or barter, or be concerned in the sale, purchase or barter, of yellow pickerel (also known as pike-perch, walleye, dore or blue pickerel) pike, lake trout, sturgeon or sauger, or any part thereof, taken from Ontario waters by angling or taken in any other manner by a person who is not the holder of a commercial fishing licence."
Provincial Officers As Delegates
Of Federal Authority
[16]
I note that in the application for injunction orders the relief sought against the defendant provincial Minister and officials and conservation officers of his Ministry includes restraint of the enforcement of s. 33 of the
Fisheries Act
and s. 4 of the
Ontario Fishery Regulations
. The first prohibits purchase, sale or possession of fish caught in contravention of the
Act
or the
Regulations
, and the second prohibits fishing without an appropriate licence. In the relief sought no reference is made to restraining enforcement of s. 72 of the
Game and Fish Act
, of Ontario, which prohibits sale, purchase or barter of fish, except in accord with the
Regulations
, where fish is caught by a person who is not the holder of a commercial fishing licence. Yet the last of these provisions, the provincial
Act
, is clearly specified as one of the bases on which provincial officers have alerted fish buyers against purchase and sale of fish.
[17]
The plaintiffs argue that a ban on commercial sales of fish, imposed on buyers, since it abolishes the plaintiffs' capacity to sell fish by abolishing their market, is in reality a prohibition of commercial fishing without a licence issued by the province in accord with authority delegated to licence fishing in Ontario under the federal
Ontario Fishery Regulations
. Such a ban, it is urged, conflicts with the plaintiffs' aboriginal and treaty right, a right said to be recognized by the Ontario Minister. While it seems clear that Minister, in the course of negotiations with the plaintiffs, does not dispute the claim to an aboriginal right to fish commercially, that cannot be taken as an acknowledgment of an unrestricted right. Indeed, a principal focus of the discussions appears to be the mutual acceptance of appropriate definition, or limitation, of that right. For different purposes both counsel for the plaintiffs and for the federal defendants referred to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 385. That decision, as I understand it, recognized, for the defendant in that case, an aboriginal right to fish for food, but it indicates that where such a right is claimed to be infringed, a court must assess whether the right exists, whether it is infringed and, if that is the case, whether the legislation infringing the right can be justified in the circumstances. Thus, implicitly, even an aboriginal right to fish for food may be subject to licence requirements where these do not infringe the right, or even if they do where that can be justified. Those questions in any given case require careful assessment after full consideration of evidence and argument and they are not appropriately considered in interlocutory proceedings. Here questions of recognition of an aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes and, if recognized, of appropriate limitation of that right, are raised by the plaintiffs' action but will only be resolved by trial.
[18]
In addition to those difficult issues, I am not persuaded that the action of Ontario officials in this case, so far as it is based upon s. 72 of the provincial
Act
, is based on legislation in relation to licensing fisheries rather than legislation relating to the purchase and sale of fish in the province. No substantial argument was effectively addressed to the purposes or effects of this provision. Without that, I am not persuaded that, while it may support licensing regulations, s. 72 of the
Game and Fish Act
of Ontario is legislation in relation to licensing of fisheries. In the circumstances, it must be taken, as its words clearly provide, as legislation in relation to the purchase and sale of fish in the province, a matter falling within provincial legislative competence under s. 92(13) of the
Constitution Act, 1867
.
[19]
Counsel for the federal defendants and for the provincial Minister urge that there is no evidence of the status of the provincial Minister or of conservation officers of his department as delegates of the federal Minister or government in acting to alert fish buyers against purchasing fish for sale from fishermen who do not hold a valid commercial fishing licence. I agree with that submission. I also agree with the provincial Minister's submission that there is no evidence that he was acting in a similar capacity in negotiations and discussions with the plaintiffs, in any acknowledgement of an aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes, or in any reliance by him or his officers upon provincial legislation; indeed, there is no allegation in the statement of claim that he was so acting in these matters.
[20]
The statement of claim does implead the provincial Minister and conservation officers of his Ministry as delegates of federal authority, in the following terms.
"4. The defendant Minister of Natural Resources has delegated authority from the defendant Minister of Fisheries to administer the
Ontario Fishery Regulations
within and for the Province of Ontario.
"5. The defendant 'Fishery Officers' are those ... conservation Officers appointed and certified by the defendant Minister of Natural Resources under his delegated authority, to enforce the provisions of the said  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
Act
and
Regulations
."
[21]
For the plaintiffs it is urged that this court should take notice that jurisdiction to administer the
Fisheries Act
and the
Ontario Fishery Regulations
is in fact delegated to provincial officers effectively by the
Act
and the
Regulations
, a relationship recognized by
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 89 N.R. 323; 31 O.A.C. 319; 56 D.L.R.(4th) 575. In that case, in dismissing the appeal the Supreme Court of Canada did so substantially for reasons given by MacKinnon, A.C.J.O., for the Ontario Court of Appeal but added the following comment (p. 1046, S.C.R.; p. 576, 56 D.L.R.(4th)):
"... At one point, however, the reasons state that the provinces are powerless to regulate fishing for commercial purposes. That is undoubtedly true of general legislation for that purpose. We would not wish, however, to be taken as accepting the proposition that the provinces lack jurisdiction to make such regulations in respect of provincially owned fisheries as an aspect of their power to administer their public property. Any such regulations would, of course be subject to overriding federal legislation."
[22]
There really is no dispute about the intergovernmental arrangements that are in place for general administration of the
Fisheries Act
and the
Ontario Fishery Regulations
by provincial officers and I accept the submission of the plaintiffs that notice be taken of that relationship. I do not accept, however, the inference from this that I understand the plaintiffs would have me draw. It seems to me the plaintiffs would have me conclude that everything done by provincial officers that affects fisheries in the province is based upon authority delegated in accord with federal legislation. Rather, as I see it, provincial officers here may act with authority based upon different sources. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  may be delegates of the federal government acting under its legislative authority in relation to seacoast and inland fisheries under s. 91(12) of the
Constitution Act
, 1867
. In relation to conservation of provincial resources or of purchase and sale of fish within the province they act within legislative authority of the province in relation to property and civil rights in the province or local and private matters in the province under s. 92, subss. (13) and (16) of the
Constitution Act, 1867
. Acting in the latter capacity they are not delegates of federal authority for the Parliament of Canada for the federal government has no legislative authority that may be delegated. In this case, the letter of March 27 from a provincial officer refers to both federal and provincial statutory provisions and it must be taken at face value as relying upon both federal and provincial legislative provisions referred to as the basis of advice to purchasers of fish.
[23]
I turn to the issues of jurisdiction raised at the hearing of preliminary issues, dealing first with the question of this Court's jurisdiction in relation to the provincial Minister in the action initiated by the plaintiffs, and then with the question of jurisdiction to award an order in the nature of an injunction against Her Majesty the Queen, the federal Minister and "Fishery Officers".
Jurisdiction In Relation To
The Provincial Minister
[24]
In the statement of claim no relief is sought specifically directed against the Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario), though he is impleaded as a defendant who is alleged to act under authority delegated by the federal Minister. The application for interlocutory relief sought includes an interlocutory injunction restraining the provincial Minister, and his officers, from interfering with the plaintiffs' aboriginal and treaty right to harvest and market fish caught in traditional waters and from enforcing s. 33 of the
Fisheries Act
and s. 4 of the
Ontario Fishery Regulations
against purchasers of the plaintiffs' fish.
[25]
On behalf of the defendant Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) it is urged that the action be dismissed as against him for want of jurisdiction. It is argued there is no affidavit evidence or allegation that, in the activities giving rise to the action, he has acted as a delegate of federal authority; that the role here played by the provincial Minister is substantially based in large part, upon jurisdiction vested in him by valid provincial law; that s. 17 of the
Federal Court Act
, supra, as amended, does not vest in this court jurisdiction over the provincial Minister in any action; and finally that the laws here acted upon by him are not exclusively laws of Canada within s. 101 of the
Constitution Act, 1867
.
[26]
While for the plaintiffs it is urged that the provincial Minister is here impleaded in his capacity as a delegate of federal authority, it is not at all clear that actions taken by him to which the plaintiffs object are undertaken under any authority delegated under the
Fisheries Act
or the
Regulations
. Moreover, the act which ultimately precipitated this action, the sending of the letter of March 27 is clearly based at least in part on s. 72 of the
Game and Fish Act
, a matter that at this stage must be taken to be within the legislative competence of the provincial legislature. That clearly is not a law of Canada within s. 101 of the
Constitution Act, 1867
, a criterion for jurisdiction of this court ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Wilson, J., at p. 330 (S.C.R.)). Insofar as the letter of March 27 refers to s. 33 of the
Fisheries Act
, the provincial Minister's officials may be deemed to act as delegates of federal authority in bringing to the attention of fish buyers federal legislation here considered applicable. But any prosecution for violation of a federally imposed prohibition may well be a matter of the administration of justice within the province under s. 92(14) of the
Constitution Act, 1867
, an issue not addressed in argument.
[27]
Finally, it is well settled that this court does not have jurisdiction under s. 17 of the
Federal Court Act
, which provides for general causes of action, over any person except the Crown (Her Majesty in Right in Canada), her servants or agents. Where the remedy sought is an injunction or declaratory relief under s. 18, that may be granted against any federal board, commission or other tribunal as defined in s. 2 of the
Act
. The definition expressly excludes "any ... body constituted or established by or under a law of a province or any ... person or persons appointed under or in accordance with a law of a province ..." (
Federal Court Act
, supra, s. 2(1)). Relief against persons other than the federal Crown is not provided by s. 17 and that section does not give this court jurisdiction to grant relief against a province (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 462 (C.A.), and
Joe personally and on behalf of the Conne River Indian Band and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 69 N.R. 318). That applies similarly in the case of a provincial Minister, a matter clearly specified in relation to declaratory or injunctive relief provided for under s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
in relation to agencies of the federal government.
[28]
Thus, I conclude that the defendant Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) is not a proper party to this action and thus to the application for an interlocutory injunction. I agree with the submission that as against the Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) the action should be dismissed for this court lacks jurisdiction in relation to that Minister.
Injunctive Relief And Other Defendants
1) An Injunction And
Her Majesty The Queen
[29]
An interlocutory injunction is sought against Her Majesty the Queen as contemplated by the provisions of s. 52 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
preventing the Crown from interfering with the plaintiffs' aboriginal and treaty right
"to harvest and market fish caught in their traditional waters, and further, ... from enforcing the provisions of the Fisheries Act, s. 33 and the Ontario Fishery Regulations, s. 4 as against the purchasers to the plaintiffs' fish, and more particularly [four named purchasers] ..."
[30]
Provisions of the
Constitution Act, 1982
raised in this action and the application for interlocutory relief include ss. 35 and 52. These provide in part:
"35(1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.
"52(1) The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.
"52(2) The Constitution of Canada includes
(a) the Canada Act 1982, including this Act;
(b) the Acts and orders referred to in the schedule; and
(c) any amendment to any Act or order referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).
. . . . ."
Section 52, it is submitted, would permit the setting aside of legislation or regulations inconsistent, inter alia, with aboriginal rights recognized in accord with s. 35(1) of the
Constitution Act, 1982
. Here it is urged that the Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) has acknowledged the aboriginal right claimed by the plaintiffs. Affidavits of staff persons of the United Church of Canada and of the Aboriginal Rights Coalition (Project North) exhibit similar letters in which the Minister acknowledges that the Government of Ontario, in the Saugeen Ojibway fisheries negotiations "does not contest the native claim to an aboriginal right to a fishery, nor the native claim to an aboriginal right to fish commercially".
[31]
While the application of s. 52 may be an issue to be assessed at trial, in my view it is not a basis for interlocutory injunctive relief at this stage. The plaintiffs did not argue and I am not persuaded, that s. 52, either directly or by implication, affects the application, in accord with the plain meaning of its wording, of s. 22 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50 as amended, which provides:
"(1) Where in proceedings against the Crown any relief is sought that might, in proceedings between persons, be granted by way of injunction or specific performance, a court shall not, as against the Crown, grant an injunction or make an order for specific performance, but in lieu thereof may make an order declaratory of the rights of the parties.
"(2) A court shall not in any proceedings grant relief or make an order against a servant of the Crown that it is not competent to grant or make against the Crown."
This provision, enacted by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 28 and in force from February 1, 1992, by virtue of S/I 92-6, reflects the immunity of the Crown and its servants from injunctive orders which was traditionally recognized at common law. The statutory provision does not reduce the Crown's long recognized immunity from an injunction.
[32]
Relief of that kind is precluded by s. 22(1) of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, in any court. Moreover, the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 as amended, under which this court is created and acts, vests no authority to grant injunctive relief against the Crown. (See
Grand Council of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), per Pratte, J.A., at p. 600 (F.C.A.) leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1982) 41 N.R. 354 sub nom:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of Canada is not a proper party defendant in the application for an interlocutory injunction.
2) An Injunction And The
Federal Minister
[33]
In regard to the court's jurisdiction to award an interlocutory injunction against the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, counsel for the federal defendants urges that there is no evidence before the court that Ontario officials, in the letter of advice to fish buyers sent in March 1992, were acting as delegates of the federal Minister, despite reference in that letter to s. 33 of the
Fisheries Act
. Whether or not that reference was in error, it is urged that Ontario officials including the defendant Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) could only be acting, in view of the division of legislative powers, in relation to matters within the province's legislative jurisdiction. Those include legislation in relation to proprietary interests in fisheries and in relation to sales of fish within the province, matters not within federal legislative competence. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (P.C.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (P.C.)). The arguments so addressed, and those relating to the merits of issues raised by the statement of claim filed by the plaintiffs, deal for the most part with issues not fully argued, and which were not before me in consideration of preliminary questions of the jurisdiction of the court. They are best left for determination on another occasion.
[34]
The argument of significance in considering whether the injunction sought should be granted against the federal Minister, at this preliminary stage, is that there is no evidence or allegations of action directly by the Minister. If he were deemed to be acting, to the extent that he acts under valid legislation no injunctive relief lies against a federal Minister, or other officer, who is acting as servant or agent of Her Majesty and within statutory duties assigned by the legislature within its legislative competence. Before the enactment of s. 22(2) of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, as amended, supra, it was well settled that as a general rule an injunction will not issue to prevent a Minister of the Crown from carrying on statutory functions. (See:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 25 N.R. 437 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[35]
There is no evidence before me that the federal Minister was here acting beyond his legislated responsibilities within the scope of valid federal legislative authority. It is urged by the plaintiffs that, though he may not have been acting directly himself or through his departmental officers, Ontario officials, acting under delegated authority, were acting on his behalf.
[36]
As I have earlier concluded, provincial officers could not be acting as delegates of the federal government or of the federal Minister in referring to s. 72 of the provincial
Game and Fish Act
. It is not clear that insofar as they alert fish buyers to the possibility of prosecution for violation of s. 33 of the
Fisheries Act
they purport to act as delegates of the federal Minister, for prosecution within the province for violation of a federal statutory prohibition may well be action in relation to the administration of justice within the province, a matter clearly within the competence of the province. Yet even if such an action were considered as acting under delegation by federal authority, at this stage, pending trial at which will be determined the existence of the aboriginal and treaty right claimed, the alleged infringement of that right by s. 33 of the
Fisheries Act
will be assessed, and justification for any infringement will be considered, in accord with the tests outlined in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  by provincial conservation officers would exceed federal authority or constitutional grounds.
[37]
I am not persuaded that the plaintiffs have established any basis on which the defendant federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans may be enjoined from any action taken or proposed. Thus, in my view that Minister is not a proper party defendant to the application for an interlocutory injunction.
3) An Injunction and "Fishery Officers"
[38]
"Fishery Officers" impleaded as defendants are not named or otherwise personally identified. In the statement of claim initiating the action they are described as "those Fishery Officers appointed and certified by the defendant Minister of Fisheries under the
Fisheries Act
within the definition of the
Act
, or alternatively ... those Conservation Officers appointed and certified by the defendant Minister of Natural Resources under his delegated authority, to enforce the provisions of the said
Act
and
Regulations
". In the motion for interlocutory injunction orders, in association with injunctive relief against the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, they are described as "the officials of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans". In addition, in relation to the defendant Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario), they are described as "the officials and fishery officers of the Ministry of Natural Resources", as agents of the defendant Minister of Fisheries, presuming they have been designated as fishery officers by the federal Minister under s. 5 of the
Fisheries Act
.
[39]
Neither the unnamed federal departmental officers nor the provincial ministry officers are appropriate defendants in relation to the injunctive relief sought. That conclusion is based on the reasons already set out for my conclusions about jurisdiction to award the relief sought against the designated defendant federal and provincial Ministers, and also upon general principles.
[40]
Without a means of identifying individual defendants, an injunctive order, if made, could not be effectively served or enforced. The court does not make orders that are not enforceable, and even if the order sought might be served on some "fishery officers" as described by the plaintiffs, this court does not consider it appropriate to exercise its discretion to grant such extraordinary relief in this case in relation to unnamed defendants. The unnamed "fishery officers", whether that description is intended to include federal departmental officers or provincial departmental officers, are not proper parties in relation to the injunctive relief here sought.
Conclusions
[41]
I sum up my conclusions in regard to jurisdictional issues raised and argued at the hearing of preliminary issues arising from the plaintiffs' statement of claim and application for interlocutory relief in the nature of injunction orders.
[42]
This court lacks jurisdiction to grant relief against the defendant/respondent Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) and he is not a party properly impleaded in the action, which as against that Minister is dismissed. The style of cause in this matter, should henceforth be amended to delete reference to that Minister as a party defendant. If costs are requested his costs shall be paid by the plaintiffs on the usual party and party basis.
[43]
This court lacks jurisdiction to grant an interlocutory injunction here sought against Her Majesty the Queen. Moreover, on the evidence adduced by affidavits in support of the application for interlocutory injunction orders, and argument advanced, the court is not persuaded that there is any basis to issue the order sought against the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Further, the Court declines to exercise discretion to issue an injunction order against unnamed "Fishery Officers".
[44]
Since I conclude, for the reasons outlined, that this court lacks jurisdiction in the case of certain defendants and that it is not appropriate to award injunctive relief as against all others of the defendants to the action who are respondents to the application, the appropriate disposition of the plaintiffs' application is that it be dismissed, with costs to be in the cause as between the plaintiffs and the federal defendants, except costs of the Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario) if he should request them. The federal defendants' motion that they be struck from the plaintiffs' application for injunctive relief is thus, in effect, granted, as provided by separate order.
[45]
Finally, while this was not raised at the hearing, it seems to me the action raises questions that may ultimately concern "the constitutional validity, applicability or operability of an Act of Parliament or of the legislature of any province or of Regulations thereunder" within the terms of s. 57 of the
Federal Court Act
, as amended. In view of this, counsel for the plaintiffs and for the federal defendants are directed to consult concerning the requirements of s. 57 and to advise the court, not later than the date upon which application is made for a date for trial in this matter, whether notice to Attorneys General as provided in that section is appropriate and if so how and when it is to be given.
Order accordingly.
