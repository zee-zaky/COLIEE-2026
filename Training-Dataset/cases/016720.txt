Strickland, J.
: This is an application by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the IRPA), for judicial review of the April 12, 2012 decision of a panel of the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Panel) allowing the appeal by Mei Fang Chen of a visa officer's decision refusing to issue a permanent resident visa to Mu Bao Yang, the Respondent's spouse. The refusal was based on section 4 (now subsection 4(1)) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations), and the officer's determination that the marriage was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of Mu Bao Yang gaining entry into Canada.
I.
Background
[2]
The Respondent and her spouse grew up in the same village in China and eventually began a romantic relationship. The Respondent lived with her brother from 1993 until 1997, while she and her spouse were dating. In December 1997, the Respondent learned that she was pregnant. The Respondent and her spouse submitted that they then began a common-law relationship.
[3]
The Respondent's son was born on August 15, 1998. The Respondent found out that she was pregnant again in early 2005, causing her and her spouse to fear being punished by the Chinese authorities for violation of China's birth control policy. In March 2005, the Respondent arrived in Canada and made a successful claim for refugee status. On October 11, 2005, her second son was born in Canada. DNA testing confirms that the Respondent and her spouse are the true biological parents of both boys.
[4]
The Respondent became a permanent resident of Canada on January 18, 2007. On July 31, 2007, during a two month visit by the Respondent to China she and her spouse married. At the end of that visit she left her younger son in China with her spouse. In 2008 the Respondent returned to China for a three month visit. This time when she returned to Canada her youngest son accompanied her. Later in 2008 the youngest son again visited China, returning to Canada in 2010. The Respondent has not been back to China since her second trip in 2008.
[5]
Pursuant to subsections 11(1) and 12(1) of the IRPA and subsections 116 and 117(1)(a) of the Regulations, the Respondent sought to sponsor her spouse as a member of the family class in gaining permanent residence in Canada. The spouse's application was refused. The visa officer found that pursuant to section 4 (now subsection 4(1)) of the Regulations, the Respondent's marriage was not genuine and that its primary purpose was for her spouse to gain admission to Canada. This finding made the spouse ineligible as a member of the family class. The officer's decision was set aside on appeal by the Panel in its Reasons and Decision dated April 12, 2012 (the Decision). The Minister now seeks judicial review of the Decision.
[6]
For the reasons that follow, the application for judicial review is dismissed.
II.
The Decision
[7]
In its Decision the Panel noted the various documentation filed by the Respondent in support of the appeal, the authenticity of which was not challenged. This included a translated certificate from Fuqing City Lin Yang Primary School disclosing that the Respondent and her spouse were enrolled there from September 1983 to July 1988 and a translated copy of a certificate issued by the Chijiao Villigers' Committee in Chapu Town, Fuqing City stating that the Respondent and her spouse were born in that village as was, on August 15, 1998, their eldest son and that in April 2005 the Respondent and her spouse paid a penalty in order to register the birth of their son so that he could attend school in China. The evidence also included a Confirmation of Enrolment form relating to their eldest son and referring to the Respondent and her spouse as being his parents; numerous photographs of the Respondent and her spouse together with their children; and, a DNA laboratory report confirming that the Respondent and her spouse were the biological parents of both of their sons.
[8]
The Panel gave great weight to its determination that the two children were born to the Respondent and her spouse. It noted the fact that the Respondent made one post- marital trip to China where she, her spouse and their children resided as a family unit for approximately three months, that the Respondent and her spouse are in regular and frequent communication with each other, that they had similar plans if the spouse were to immigrate to Canada, and, that they are also compatible as to age, education, ethnicity and socio-economic background.
[9]
The Panel noted that there were some contradictions in the evidence given by the Respondent and her spouse, including that the Respondent stated that she and her spouse had lived with her brother in China while her spouse stated that they lived with his brother. The spouse also stated that he registered his son's birth certificate, while the Respondent said it was registered by her brother. The spouse further stated that his brother helped finance the purchase of the Respondent's condominium in Toronto while the Respondent stated that it was her brother who provided the loan. As to her criminal conviction, the Respondent stated in general terms that her spouse knew of it and, in his testimony, her spouse confirmed a general knowledge of the Respondent's conviction. His incorrect knowledge of her employment in Alberta was, however, consistent with the Respondent's evidence that she did not disclose particular information regarding her criminal conviction to her spouse.
[10]
The Panel concluded that, upon careful consideration of the oral and documentary evidence and on the balance of probabilities, the inconsistencies in the evidence did not denigrate from the other evidence going to the genuineness of the Respondent's marriage and allowed the appeal.
III.
Issues
[11]
The Applicant raises only one issue in this application for judicial review - was the Panel's determination that the Respondent and her spouse were in a genuine marriage reasonable?
IV.
Standard of review
[12]
The Supreme Court of Canada has held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[13]
This Court has held that the determination of whether a marriage is genuine is a question of fact to be evaluated on the reasonableness standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
V.
Analysis
[14]
The Minister's position is that there were significant inconsistencies in four areas of the evidence given by the Respondent and her spouse whereas, in a genuine relationship, it would reasonably be expected that they would have provided consistent evidence. These four areas of evidence are: a) the registration of their eldest son for school; b) who they lived with as common law spouses between the years 1997 and 2005; c) when the Respondent purchased her condominium in Toronto; and, d) the Respondent's arrest and incarceration in Alberta. Given these inconsistencies, the Panel's decision was unreasonable.
[15]
The position of the Respondent is, in essence, that the Panel carefully considered and weighed all of the evidence, including the contradictory evidence given by the Respondent and her spouse, and came to a reasonable decision. As such, this Court may not substitute its own view of a preferable outcome or reweigh the evidence. Accordingly, the Panel's decision must stand.
a)
Late Registration of Eldest Son
[16]
With respect to the eldest son's school registration, the Respondent testified before the Panel that her older brother registered her son for school in 2005, when the Respondent was already in Canada. The Respondent asked her brother to do this because if she or her spouse had done so then they would have been identified by the authorities as having violated China's birth control policies and subjected to many sanctions including sterilization; however, in having her brother register her son they only had to pay a fine. Previously, during the interview with the officer, the Respondent's spouse gave evidence that he was the one who registered his son for school and, with the exception of paying a fine, he faced no difficulties in doing so. In its application the Minister adds that the spouse had made no mention of potential sterilization. The Minister asserts that the Panel failed to address this inconsistency and made no mention of the spouse's contrary evidence. Therefore, the Panel's analysis surrounding the Respondent's son's school registration was unreasonable.
[17]
Paragraphs 60 and 61 of the Decision states as follows:
[60] The appellant stated that she and the applicant lived with her brother in China. The applicant stated that he and the appellant lived with his brother. The applicant stated that he registered his son's birth certificate. The appellant stated that the birth certificate was registered by her brother.
[61] The panel, while acknowledging these conflicts in evidence, notes that regardless of the person with whom the appellant and applicant lived, that on the balance of probabilities and on the evidence adduced at this hearing the appellant and applicant lived together for several years in a common-law relationship. The child was registered in his own name. At the time of the registration a fine was paid which is consistent with the testimony given by the appellant with respect to her fear of the birth control policies of China.
[18]
In my view, the Panel did recognize the inconsistent evidence as to who registered the eldest son's birth certificate. Further, the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System notes (CAIPS notes) of the officer generated with respect to the February 12, 2009 interview of the spouse were before the Panel and read as follows:
...Did you live together? Yes. From what time to what time? From Dec 1997 to 2005. That's the span of 8 years. Were you married? No. Why? I did propose but her parents objected. How do you explain then that you were able to live together for 8 years did her parents not object to that? Pi smiles. She was pregnant and that's when we started to live together. To have a baby out of wedlock is against PRC policy. Do you have proof of the fee penalty for violating/breaching that policy? We did not apply for the Family Register until 30 March 2005.
We got the baby's Birth certificate in March 2005. Were you fined at that time? Yes. Do you have proof? No. Why? I did not keep it. Sir you are not credible ....
[19]
And, when asked why they did not opt to marry in March 2005 before the Respondent's departure for Canada, the spouse responded: "If we went to the Marriage registration office we would need to be enforced with the birth control surgery. Please explain. After one child we would need to get the birth control surgery .....".
[20]
It seems to me that the evidence before the Panel was consistent in that both the Respondent and her spouse indicated their eldest son's birth was late registered because they were concerned that they would have to pay a penalty or fine as a result of the birth out of wedlock. Upon the registration they did pay such a penalty as documented above. Further, at the time of the registration the Respondent was again pregnant. This gave rise to the another concern, expressed by both the Respondent and her spouse, that they would be subject to birth control surgery due to China's one child policy. It also led to the Respondent's departure for Canada where she sought and was granted refugee status. The sole inconsistency is whether the spouse or the Respondent's brother registered the eldest son. The Panel, at paragraphs 60 and 61 of its Decision, specifically acknowledged this inconsistency but elected to give it little weight when it considered the evidence in whole, stating in that regard:
[67] Upon careful consideration of the oral and documentary evidence the panel finds on the balance of probabilities that the inconsistencies in the evidence do not denigrate from the other evidence going to the genuineness of the appellant's marriage. The weight of the evidence falls on the balance of probabilities in favour of allowing this appeal.
[21]
The inconsistency as to who registered the eldest son for school was a minor one which was recognized and addressed by the Panel. Further, the jurisprudence of this Court confirms that the relative weight to be given to evidence of the genuineness of a marriage is exclusively up to the officer or panel (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), that tribunal decisions are not to be microscopically reviewed (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) and that considerable deference must be accorded by this Court to decisions of specialized tribunals such as the Panel ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). Accordingly, I find that it was open to the Panel and reasonable for it to conclude as it did on this issue.
b)
Common Law Place of Residence
[22]
The Minister argues that the Panel erred in failing to explain why it disregarded the discrepancy between the Respondent's evidence on this issue and that of her spouse. Specifically, the Respondent testified that she and her husband lived with her brother before she left for Canada, while her spouse stated that they lived with his family. The Minister further argues that the Panel did not specify the alternate evidence it relied on to overcome this discrepancy and to conclude that the Respondent and her spouse had lived together in a long term common law relationship. Accordingly, the Minister asserts that the Panel's reasons are deficient.
[23]
In this regard, paragraphs 60 and 61 of the Decision specifically acknowledge this inconsistency and the Panel went on to conclude that, regardless of the person(s) with whom the Respondent and her spouse resided, they did live together for several years in a common-law relationship.
[24]
The evidence on the record before the Panel included the Respondent and her spouse's testimony before the Panel; the Affidavit of the Respondent filed in support of the appeal and its exhibits which included a translation of the Confirmation of Enrolment form relating to their eldest son and referring to the Respondent and her spouse as being his parents; a copy of the Canadian passport of the younger son confirming his stay in China between June 27, 2007 and September 4, 2008 and between October 12, 2008 and January 2010; the evidence of both the Respondent and her spouse that the younger son resided with the spouse during this time; and, statements of the spouse, the Respondent's father and a close friend of the Respondent confirming that the Respondent and her spouse resided together from late 1997 to March 2005 when she departed for Canada. Based on the testimony of the Respondent and her spouse and on the DNA laboratory report of Maxxam Analytics Inc., the Panel was also satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the children are the children of the relationship of the Respondent and her spouse. That finding was not challenged in this application.
[25]
In my view, the Panel addressed the inconsistency in the evidence as to where the Respondent and her spouse resided during their common law relationship and reasonably concluded, regardless of same, that based on the whole of the evidence before it and on the balance of probabilities, the Respondent and her spouse did live together in a common law relationship in China for a number of years. In this regard it is also significant that their eldest son was born on August 15, 1998 and that the Respondent became pregnant with the younger son in 2005. This strongly supports the existence of the ongoing long term relationship.
[26]
Furthermore, while the Minister argues that the Panel failed to specify what evidence it relied on to overcome the discrepancy in the evidence and to conclude that the Respondent and her spouse lived in a long term common law relationship, as I have noted above, there was various evidence before the Panel that supports such a conclusion, and there is no indication that any of it was overlooked. The Panel is presumed to have considered all of the evidence before it (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]) and was not obligated to mention every piece of evidence it relied on (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As a result, the Panel's conclusion on this matter was reasonable.
c)
Date of Purchase of Condominium
[27]
As to the condominium purchase, the Minister notes that the Respondent's testimony before the Panel was that in April 2008 she purchased a condominium unit in Toronto with money received from various sources, including cash received as wedding gifts. However, at the same hearing the spouse was unable to say if the Respondent purchased the unit before or after they married.
[28]
The Minister acknowledges that the Panel, at paragraph 62 of its Decision, addressed the ownership of the condominium. However, the Minister takes the position that because the Panel did not specifically refer to the fact that the spouse did not know when the unit was purchased and because the Panel failed to state in its reasons how the fact that the spouse knew that the Respondent owned the condominium served to establish that they were in a genuine relationship, that the Panel's analysis was unreasonable.
[29]
At the hearing the spouse was asked where he would live if he were to come to Canada. He answered that he would live with his wife and kids. He was then asked if he knew if his wife owned property in Canada. He replied that he knew she bought property there. When asked how she got the down payment he stated that his brother sent money, that she borrowed some "And then when the wedding reception happen, people bring money as a gift."
[30]
This testimony is reflected in the Decision:
[40] The applicant knew that the appellant owned her own residence in Toronto which, he stated, is where he and his son would reside were they to immigrate to Canada. The applicant stated that the funds were required for the down payment to purchase the condominium were derived by monies lent to the appellant by her brother and the money they received from wedding gifts ...
[62] The applicant stated that his brother helped finance the down payment for the purchase of the appellant's condominium in Toronto. The appellant stated that it was her brother who loaned her the money in this regard. The fact remains that the appellant is the owner of this condominium and that the applicant knew that the appellant owns a condominium in Toronto.
[31]
When asked at the hearing about the specific timing of the condominium purchase, the spouse replied that it was a long time ago and that he had forgotten when it occurred.
[32]
Based on the evidence before it, the Panel was aware that the spouse could not recall exactly when the Respondent purchased the condominium. The fact that the Panel did not state this in the Decision is not unreasonable or a reviewable error. Further, the spouse knew and stated that money received as gifts at the July 31, 2007 wedding was used, in part, to fund the down payment for the condominium. Impliedly then, the condominium purchase in April 2008 was subsequent to wedding.
[33]
The Panel need not state in its reasons precisely how "the mere fact" that the Respondent's spouse was aware of the fact that she owned a condominium established that they were in a genuine relationship. The Panel was required to review and weigh all of the evidence before it in determining if a genuine relationship existed, or, if it was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA. In this case the Panel found that the salient point was that the Respondent is the owner of the condominium and that her spouse knew that she owns a condominium in Toronto. This, when considered with the all of the other evidence, led to the Panel's conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, the marriage was not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA and that it is a genuine marriage. As the Panel is presumed to have considered and all the evidence and weighed it appropriately (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), and there is no indication that any evidence was overlooked, the Panel's conclusion on this issue was reasonable.
d) The Respondent's Conviction
[34]
As regards to the Respondent's arrest and incarceration, the Minister points out that the Respondent's spouse did not know when the Respondent was arrested or the reason for the arrest. The Minister acknowledges that the Panel was not concerned with this lack of knowledge and found that because the Respondent's spouse was generally aware that the Respondent had been incarcerated in Alberta that the lack of knowledge was immaterial. However, the Minister asserts that the Panel had "an obligation to explain in its reasons why it would consider such a fact immaterial" given that it is reasonable to assume that in a genuine relationship such a matter would be discussed between spouses.
[35]
The Panel did address this matter in its reasons:
[63] The appellant stated in general terms that the applicant knew of her criminal conviction in Alberta and the fact that she was detained. The applicant in his testimony revealed a general knowledge of the applicant being detained in Alberta. The applicant gave incorrect evidence as to the nature of the appellant's employment in Alberta, which is consistent with the evidence given by the appellant to the effect that she did not disclose particular information regarding her criminal conviction to the applicant.
[36]
It found, at paragraph 67, upon careful consideration of the oral and documentary evidence, that on the balance of probabilities the inconsistencies in the evidence do not denigrate from the other evidence going to the genuineness of the appellant's marriage.
[37]
In my view, with respect to the conviction, there was no inconsistency in the evidence. The spouse only knew, and therefore could only testify to, general information pertaining to that event because that was all that he was told by the Respondent. Further, the Panel in its reasons did indicate why the spouse's lack of detailed knowledge as to the Respondent's conviction was reasonable in the circumstances and also stated that its Decision was based on its review of all of the evidence. There was no obligation on the Panel to do more.
[38]
As to the whole of the application, the standard of reasonableness which is applicable to the question of the purpose for or genuineness of a marriage entitles a decision-maker to a high level of deference and such decisions must be interpreted as a whole (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 7). In this case, the Panel reviewed the evidence and determined that, on the whole, the Respondent's marriage to her spouse was genuine and was not entered into primarily to acquire status under the IRPA. A review of the record does not reveal that the Decision was "outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 59).
[39]
With respect to children of the marriage, this Court has stated that:
When the Board is required to examine the genuineness of a marriage under ss. 63(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27, it must proceed with great care because the consequences of a mistake will be catastrophic to the family. That is particularly obvious where the family includes a child born of the relationship. The subsequent birth of a child would ordinarily be sufficient to dispel any lingering concern [as to genuineness.]
...
The Board was correct in acknowledging that, in the assessment of the legitimacy of a marriage, great weight must be attributed to the birth of a child. Where there is no question about paternity, it would not be unreasonable to apply an evidentiary presumption in favour of the genuineness of such a marriage. There are many reasons for affording great significance to such an event not the least of which is that the parties to a fraudulent marriage are unlikely to risk the lifetime responsibilities associated with raising a child.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[40]
In its Decision the Panel correctly placed great weight on the fact that Respondent and her spouse have two children together. However, this was not the only factor that it relied on in determining that "the inconsistencies in the evidence [did] not denigrate from the other evidence going to the genuineness of the ...marriage." For example, the Panel noted at paragraphs 56 to 59 of the Decision that:
- The Respondent made one post-marital trip to China, at which time she and her spouse and their children resided together for over two months;
- The Respondent and her spouse are in frequent contact with one another;
- The Respondent's spouse has not made any previous attempts to come to Canada;
- There was no persuasive evidence to indicate that the spouse has any close family members living in Canada besides his wife and younger son;
- The Respondent and her spouse share similar plans in the event that her spouse is able to immigrate to Canada;
- They are compatible with regards to age, education, ethnicity and socio-economic background.
[41]
The Panel also considered letters submitted by friends and family of the Respondent and her spouse which speak to their mutual desire to be reunited as a family.
[42]
In the submission made before me on behalf of the Minister it was argued that the Respondent's spouse admitted that his marriage was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of gaining entry into Canada when, during his interview with the officer, he replied "yes" to the officer's statement "[s]o it seems to me the purpose of your marriage is to live in [Canada]?". The response to that question was not pursued by the officer, who asked no follow up questions. And, when the spouse's translated answer is read in the context of that interview as a whole and the subsequent evidence before the Panel, I do not think it serves as an admission fatal to the genuineness of the marriage.
[43]
The jurisprudence of this Court confirms that there is no specific test or set of tests established for determining whether a marriage or relationship is genuine and that the relative weight to be given to each is exclusively up to the officer or panel (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In this case the Panel used its discretion and, despite the evidentiary inconsistencies that it noted, concluded that the marriage was genuine and was not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA.
[44]
The Applicant also argues that the Panel's analysis and reasons regarding the four areas of discrepancy were deficient. However, the Supreme Court of Canada has recently established that the adequacy of reasons is not a freestanding ground for quashing a decision (see
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Newfoundland Nurses' Union
]) and that:
A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion
(Service Employees' International Union, Local No 333 v Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn
, [1975] 1 SCR 382, at p 391). In other words, if the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria are met.
[45]
As stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and as quoted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
It is not sufficient for an Applicant seeking judicial review to identify errors with respect to a few of the Board's findings of fact or some weakness in its analysis of the evidence. A decision will be maintained if it can be seen to be supported by other factual findings reasonably made.
[46]
Furthermore, as Mr. Justice Michael M.J. Shore stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
There is a rebuttable presumption that the IAD has considered the totality of evidence in assessing whether a marriage is a bad faith marriage (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). According to the jurisprudence of this Court, the presumption may be rebutted if the IAD did not, at least, address evidence that is relevant to the question at issue and contradicts its conclusion on that issue. As Justice John Maxwell Evans held in
Cepeda-Gutierrez
:
[17] ... the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact 'without regard to the evidence' ... In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts"
[47]
Here the Panel addressed the discrepancies in the evidence and concluded that the incidences of marriage outweighed them. The Applicant is ultimately unhappy with a perceived lack of stated reasons on certain of the issues and with weight the Panel ascribed to the four areas of inconsistent evidence put forward in its submission.
[48]
The role of a reviewing court is to examine the reasons together with the record to determine if the outcome is within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. Having done so I am of the view that the Decision, taken as a whole, is reasonable. The Panel's analysis and reasons were adequate and, in any event, any inadequacy is not in itself sufficient to warrant the quashing of the Decision. Moreover, it is not the role of the Court to reweigh the evidence. Accordingly, and for the reasons above, this application is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[49]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed. No question of general importance for certification has been proposed and none arises. There is no order as to costs.

Le Ministre de la Sécurité Publique et de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile, sous le régime du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la LIPR), d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision en date du 12 avril 2012 par laquelle un tribunal de la Section d'appel de l'immigration de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (le tribunal) a accueilli l'appel interjeté par Mme Mei Fang Chen à l'encontre de la décision d'un agent des visas portant refus de délivrer un visa de résident permanent à son mari, M. Mu Bao Yang. Ce refus se fondait sur l'article 4 [qui est maintenant le paragraphe 4(1)] du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 (le Règlement), l'agent des visas ayant conclu que le mariage en question n'était pas authentique et visait principalement à permettre au mari d'entrer au Canada.
I.
Le contexte
[2]
La défenderesse et son mari ont grandi dans le même village de Chine et ont par la suite noué une relation amoureuse. Mme Chen a vécu chez son frère de 1993 à 1997, période pendant laquelle elle fréquentait son futur mari. En décembre 1997, elle a appris qu'elle était enceinte. Selon leurs dires, elle et M. Yang sont alors devenus conjoints de fait.
[3]
Le fils de la défenderesse est né le 15 août 1998. Celle-ci s'étant rendu compte qu'elle était de nouveau enceinte au début de 2005, les conjoints ont éprouvé la crainte de se voir sanctionner par l'État chinois pour avoir enfreint sa politique de régulation des naissances. En mars 2005, la défenderesse est entrée au Canada et y a formé une demande d'asile qui a été accueillie. Son deuxième fils est né au Canada le 11 octobre 2005. L'analyse génétique confirme que la défenderesse et son conjoint sont les parents biologiques des deux garçons.
[4]
La défenderesse est devenue résidente permanente au Canada le 18 janvier 2007. C'est le 31 juillet de la même année, au cours d'un séjour de deux mois en Chine, qu'elle a épousé M. Yang. À la fin de ce séjour, elle a laissé son fils cadet en Chine, aux soins de son mari. Elle est retournée dans son pays d'origine en 2008, pour un séjour de trois mois. Cette fois, elle est revenue au Canada avec son fils cadet. Ce dernier est retourné en Chine plus tard en 2008, pour revenir au Canada en 2010. La défenderesse n'est plus retournée dans son pays d'origine depuis le deuxième voyage qu'elle y a fait en 2008.
[5]
La défenderesse a parrainé son mari dans la demande de résidence permanente au Canada qu'il a formée en tant que membre de la catégorie « regroupement familial » sous le régime des paragraphes 11(1) et 12(1) de la LIPR, ainsi que de l'article 116 et de l'alinéa 117(1)
a
) du Règlement. L'agent des visas saisi de la demande du mari l'a rejetée au titre de l'article 4 [qui est maintenant le paragraphe 4(1)] du Règlement, ayant conclu que le mariage de la défenderesse n'était pas authentique et visait principalement à permettre à son mari d'être admis au Canada. Cette conclusion excluait le mari de la catégorie « regroupement familial ». Le tribunal a annulé en appel cette décision de l'agent des visas par décision motivée en date du 12 avril 2012 (la décision contrôlée). C'est de cette dernière décision que le ministre demande ici le contrôle judiciaire.
[6]
Par les motifs dont l'exposé suit, la Cour rejette la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire.
II.
La décision contrôlée
[7]
Le tribunal récapitule dans la décision contrôlée les pièces produites par la défenderesse à l'appui de son appel, pièces dont l'authenticité n'a pas été contestée. Ce dossier comprend un certificat traduit de l'école primaire Lin Yang de la ville de Fuqing, selon lequel la défenderesse et son mari y étaient inscrits de septembre 1983 à janvier 1988, ainsi qu'une copie traduite d'une attestation délivrée par le comité des villageois de Chijiao, localité de Chapu dans la ville de Fuqing, portant que la défenderesse et son mari sont nés dans ce village, tout comme leur fils aîné y a vu le jour le 15 août 1998, et que le couple a payé une amende en avril 2005 afin de pouvoir enregistrer la naissance de cet enfant et qu'il fût ainsi autorisé à aller à l'école en Chine. La preuve de la défenderesse comprenait aussi un formulaire de confirmation d'inscription du fils aîné où elle-même et son mari étaient cités comme étant ses parents, de nombreuses photographies la représentant en compagnie de son mari et de leurs enfants, et un rapport d'analyse génétique en laboratoire confirmant qu'elle et son conjoint étaient les parents biologiques des deux garçons.
[8]
Le tribunal a donné beaucoup de poids à sa conclusion que la défenderesse et le mari de celle-ci étaient bien les parents des deux enfants. Il a pris acte que la défenderesse avait fait après son mariage un séjour en Chine pendant lequel elle-même, son mari et leurs enfants avaient cohabité en famille environ trois mois, qu'elle et son mari communiquaient de manière régulière et fréquente, que leurs projets concordaient pour le cas où le mari serait autorisé à immigrer au Canada, et que les conjoints étaient également compatibles sous les rapports de l'âge, de l'éducation, de l'origine ethnique et du milieu socio-économique.
[9]
Le tribunal a relevé certaines contradictions dans les témoignages respectifs de la défenderesse et de son mari, notamment le fait que celle-là a déclaré avoir vécu avec son conjoint chez son propre frère en Chine, alors que selon le mari le couple avait habité chez son frère à lui. En outre, le mari a déclaré avoir lui-même enregistré l'acte de naissance de son fils, tandis que d'après la défenderesse, c'est son frère à elle qui s'en était chargé. De même, le mari a expliqué que son frère avait aidé la défenderesse à acheter l'appartement de copropriété qu'elle possède à Toronto, alors que, aux dires de cette dernière, c'est son frère à elle qui lui avait consenti le prêt nécessaire. Quant à la condamnation de la défenderesse au pénal, cette dernière a déclaré en termes généraux que son mari en avait connaissance, et celui-ci a confirmé dans son témoignage en être au courant dans les grandes lignes. Le fait que M. Yang eût cependant une connaissance inexacte de la vie professionnelle de la défenderesse en Alberta était compatible avec la déclaration de Mme Chen selon laquelle elle ne lui avait pas donné de renseignements détaillés sur ses démêlés avec la justice.
[10]
Le tribunal a conclu que, à en juger d'après un examen attentif de la preuve orale et documentaire et suivant la prépondérance des probabilités, les contradictions relevées dans ladite preuve ne discréditaient pas les autres éléments tendant à établir l'authenticité du mariage de la défenderesse, et il a accueilli l'appel.
III.
Les questions en litige
[11]
Le demandeur soulève une seule question dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire, soit le point de savoir si la décision du tribunal concluant à l'authenticité du mariage de la défenderesse et de M. Yang remplit la condition du caractère raisonnable.
IV.
La norme de contrôle judiciaire
[12]
La Cour suprême du Canada a posé en principe dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), qu'il n'est pas nécessaire d'effectuer dans chaque cas une analyse exhaustive pour déterminer la norme de contrôle qui convient. Lorsque la jurisprudence établit déjà de manière satisfaisante la norme de contrôle applicable à la question dont elle est saisie, la cour de révision peut l'adopter sans autre examen. C'est seulement lorsque sa recherche dans la jurisprudence se révèle infructueuse qu'elle doit entreprendre l'analyse des quatre facteurs qui définissent la norme de contrôle appropriée.
[13]
Notre Cour a dit pour droit que le point de savoir si un mariage est authentique est une question de fait qui relève de la norme du caractère raisonnable; voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 4, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 4 et 5. La cour qui contrôle une décision suivant la norme du caractère raisonnable doit se rappeler dans son analyse que ce caractère « tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit »; voir
Dunsmir
, précité, paragraphe 47, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 59.
V.
Analyse
[14]
Le ministre fait valoir que la preuve produite par la défenderesse et son mari est entachée d'importantes contradictions sur quatre questions, alors qu'il est raisonnable de penser que les partenaires d'une relation authentique auraient donné des témoignages concordants. Ces quatre questions sont: a) l'enregistrement de leur fils aîné à des fins scolaires; b) le point de savoir chez qui ils ont cohabité en tant que conjoints de fait de 1997 à 2005; c) le point de savoir quand la défenderesse a acheté son appartement de copropriété à Toronto; et d) l'arrestation et l'incarcération de la défenderesse en Alberta. Étant donné ces contradictions, soutient le ministre, la décision du tribunal est déraisonnable.
[15]
La thèse de la défenderesse est, pour l'essentiel, que le tribunal a examiné et apprécié attentivement la preuve, y compris les déclarations contradictoires données par elle-même et son mari, et qu'il est arrivé à une décision raisonnable, de sorte que la Cour ne peut y substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable ni apprécier à nouveau la preuve. Par conséquent, la décision du tribunal doit être maintenue.
a)
L'enregistrement tardif du fils aîné
[16]
Pour ce qui concerne l'enregistrement du fils aîné à des fins scolaires, la défenderesse a déclaré devant le tribunal que son frère aîné s'en était chargé en 2005, alors qu'elle se trouvait déjà au Canada. Elle a demandé ce service à son frère parce que si elle-même ou son mari avaient enregistré l'enfant, les autorités auraient constaté qu'ils avaient enfreint la politique chinoise de régulation des naissances et leur auraient infligé de multiples sanctions, notamment la stérilisation, tandis que, en déléguant cette démarche, le couple avait pu s'en tirer avec une amende. Auparavant, au cours de son entretien avec l'agent des visas, le mari de la défenderesse avait déclaré que c'était lui qui avait enregistré son fils à des fins scolaires et que, exception faite de l'infliction d'une amende, on ne lui avait pas fait de difficultés. Le ministre ajoute dans sa demande que le mari n'avait pas évoqué le risque de stérilisation. Le ministre soutient que le tribunal n'a pas pris en compte ces déclarations contradictoires du mari ni n'en a fait mention. Par conséquent, raisonne-t-il, l'analyse du tribunal concernant l'enregistrement du fils de la défenderesse à des fins scolaires ne remplit pas la condition du caractère raisonnable.
[17]
Les paragraphes 60 et 61 de la décision contrôlée sont rédigés comme suit:
[60] L'appelante a déclaré qu'elle et le demandeur ont vécu avec son frère en Chine. Le demandeur a déclaré que lui et l'appelante ont vécu avec son frère à lui. Le demandeur a indiqué qu'il a lui-même enregistré l'acte de naissance de son fils. L'appelante a affirmé que l'acte de naissance avait plutôt été enregistré par son frère.
[61] Bien qu'il reconnaisse ces contradictions dans la preuve, le tribunal note que quelle que soit la personne avec qui l'appelante et le demandeur habitaient, selon la prépondérance des probabilités et les éléments de preuve produits à l'audience, l'appelante et le demandeur ont vécu en union de fait pendant plusieurs années. L'enfant a été enregistré en son nom propre. Au moment de l'enregistrement, une amende a été payée, ce qui correspond au témoignage donné par l'appelante concernant sa peur rattachée à la politique chinoise de régulation des naissances.
[18]
À mon sens, le tribunal a bel et bien pris acte des contradictions de la preuve touchant le point de savoir qui avait enregistré l'acte de naissance du fils aîné. En outre, les notes prises par l'agent des visas sur son entretien du 12 février 2009 avec le mari et introduites dans le Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration (les notes du STIDI) avaient été déposées devant le tribunal. J'en extrais le passage suivant:
[TRADUCTION] (...) Avez-vous déjà cohabité? Oui. De quand à quand? De décembre 1997 à 2005. Donc durant huit ans. Étiez-vous mariés? Non. Pourquoi? J'ai demandé sa main, mais ses parents se sont opposés au mariage. Comment expliquez-vous que vous ayez pu vivre ensemble durant huit ans? Ses parents ne se sont-ils pas aussi opposés à cette cohabitation? Le demandeur sourit. Elle est tombée enceinte: c'est alors que nous avons commencé à vivre ensemble. La naissance d'un enfant hors mariage enfreint la politique de la RPC. Pouvez-vous prouver que vous avez payé l'amende qu'encourent ceux qui contreviennent à cette politique? Nous n'avons demandé l'inscription au registre des familles que le 30 mars 2005. Nous avons obtenu l'acte de naissance du bébé en mars 2005. Vous a-t-on mis à l'amende à ce moment-là? Oui. Pouvez-vous en produire une preuve? Non. Pourquoi? Je n'ai pas conservé le document. Monsieur, vous n'êtes pas crédible [...]
[19]
À la question de savoir pourquoi le couple n'avait pas décidé de se marier en mars 2005 avant le départ de la défenderesse pour le Canada, le mari a répondu: [TRADUCTION] « Si nous étions allés au Bureau d'enregistrement des mariages, nous aurions dû nous soumettre à l'obligation de stérilisation. C'est-à-dire? Ayant déjà eu un enfant, nous aurions été obligés de subir l'opération chirurgicale que prévoit la politique de régulation des naissances [...] »
[20]
Il me paraît que les éléments de preuve dont disposait le tribunal étaient concordants en ce que la défenderesse et son mari ont tous deux déclaré que la naissance de leur fils avait été enregistrée tardivement parce qu'ils craignaient d'avoir à payer une pénalité ou une amende du fait que cette naissance fût hors mariage. Au moment de l'enregistrement, ils ont effectivement payé une pénalité comme on l'a vu plus haut. En outre, à cette date, la défenderesse était de nouveau enceinte, ce qui suscitait une autre crainte, exprimée par la défenderesse aussi bien que par son mari, soit celle de devoir subir une opération de stérilisation en raison de la politique chinoise de l'enfant unique. Cette nouvelle crainte a aussi motivé le départ de la défenderesse vers le Canada, où elle a demandé et s'est vu accorder l'asile. La seule contradiction concerne la question de savoir si c'est le mari ou le frère de la défenderesse qui a enregistré le fils aîné. Le tribunal, aux paragraphes 60 et 61 de sa décision, a explicitement relevé cette contradiction, mais a décidé de ne lui accorder que peu de poids au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve. Il écrit plus loin à ce sujet:
[67] Après avoir examiné attentivement la preuve orale et documentaire, le tribunal conclut que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, les incohérences relevées dans la preuve ne portent pas atteinte aux autres éléments de preuve liés à l'authenticité du mariage de l'appelante. Selon la prépondérance des probabilités, la preuve permet largement de conclure qu'il y a lieu de faire droit à l'appel.
[21]
La contradiction touchant le point de savoir qui a enregistré le fils aîné aux fins d'inscription scolaire était mineure, et le tribunal l'a relevée et en a tenu compte. En outre, la jurisprudence de notre Cour confirme que la détermination du poids relatif à accorder aux éléments de preuve afférents à l'authenticité d'un mariage est exclusivement du ressort de l'agent ou du tribunal saisis [voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 24], qu'il ne convient pas d'examiner à la loupe les décisions du tribunal administratif [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 12], et que notre Cour doit exercer une retenue considérable à l'égard des décisions de tribunaux spécialisés telles que la décision contrôlée ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité). En conséquence, je conclus qu'il était loisible au tribunal, et raisonnable de sa part, de trancher comme il l'a fait la question qui nous occupe.
b)
Le lieu de cohabitation en tant que conjoints de fait
[22]
Le ministre soutient que le tribunal a commis une erreur en omettant d'expliquer pourquoi il était passé outre à la contradiction entre les déclarations de la défenderesse et de son mari sur ce sujet. En termes plus particuliers, la défenderesse a déclaré dans son témoignage qu'elle avait vécu avec son mari chez son frère à elle avant son départ pour le Canada, tandis que, aux dires du mari, le couple avait habité chez sa famille à lui. Le ministre avance de plus que le tribunal n'a pas précisé sur quels autres éléments de preuve il s'était fondé pour écarter cette contradiction et conclure que le couple avait cohabité dans le cadre d'une union de fait de longue durée. Par conséquent, raisonne le ministre, les motifs du tribunal sont insuffisants.
[23]
Je ferai observer à ce sujet que le tribunal a explicitement relevé cette contradiction aux paragraphes 60 et 61 de la décision contrôlée, pour ensuite conclure que, quelles que soient la ou les personnes chez qui la défenderesse et son conjoint avaient cohabité, ils avaient vécu plusieurs années en tant que conjoints de fait.
[24]
La preuve dont disposait le tribunal comprenait les témoignages donnés par la défenderesse et son mari devant lui, l'affidavit de la défenderesse déposé au soutien de son appel, ainsi que les pièces y annexées, soit: une traduction du formulaire de confirmation d'inscription de leur fils aîné, où ils étaient cités comme étant ses parents; une copie du passeport canadien du fils cadet, confirmant qu'il avait séjourné en Chine du 27 juin 2007 au 4 septembre 2008 et du 12 octobre 2008 à janvier 2010; les déclarations de la défenderesse aussi bien que de son mari selon lesquelles le fils cadet avait habité chez celui-ci pendant ces périodes; et des déclarations du mari, du père et d'une amie intime de la défenderesse confirmant que cette dernière avait cohabité avec son conjoint de la fin de 1997 jusqu'à son départ pour le Canada en mars 2005. En outre, les témoignages de la défenderesse et de son mari, de même que le rapport d'analyse génétique du laboratoire Maxxam Analytics Inc., ont convaincu le tribunal selon la prépondérance des probabilités que les deux garçons étaient bien les enfants du couple. Cette dernière conclusion n'est pas contestée dans la présente instance.
[25]
À mon avis, le tribunal a pris en considération la contradiction des témoignages touchant l'endroit où la défenderesse et son conjoint avaient habité durant leur période d'union de fait, et il a raisonnablement conclu en dépit de cette contradiction que, à en juger d'après l'ensemble de la preuve dont il disposait et suivant la prépondérance des probabilités, ils avaient bel et bien cohabité en tant que conjoints de fait en Chine durant plusieurs années. Il est également à noter à ce propos que leur fils aîné est né le 15 août 1998 et que la défenderesse est devenue enceinte du cadet en 2005. Ce fait étaye solidement l'existence d'une relation continue de longue durée.
[26]
En outre, si le ministre met de l'avant, comme je le disais plus haut, que le tribunal a omis de préciser sur quels éléments de preuve il se fondait pour écarter la contradiction entre les témoignages et pour conclure que les conjoints avaient vécu en union de fait sur une longue durée, ledit tribunal disposait de divers éléments de preuve étayant une telle conclusion, et rien n'indique qu'il en ait négligé aucun. Le tribunal est présumé avoir pris en considération la totalité de la preuve produite devant lui [voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), paragraphe 7], et il n'était pas tenu de citer chaque élément de preuve sur lequel il se fondait [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 11]. Par conséquent, la conclusion du tribunal sur cette question est raisonnable.
c)
La date de l'achat de l'appartement
[27]
Concernant l'achat de l'appartement de copropriété, le ministre fait observer que la défenderesse a déclaré dans son témoignage devant le tribunal qu'elle avait acheté un appartement à Toronto en avril 2008 avec l'argent reçu de diverses sources, notamment sous forme de cadeaux de mariage, alors que le mari, à la même audience, s'est révélé incapable de préciser si la défenderesse avait acheté cet appartement avant ou après leur mariage.
[28]
Le ministre reconnaît que le tribunal a examiné la question de la propriété de l'appartement au paragraphe 62 de la décision contrôlée. Cependant, ajoute-t-il, étant donné que le tribunal n'a pas explicitement mentionné que le mari ne savait pas à quel moment l'appartement avait été acheté et qu'il a omis de préciser dans ses motifs en quoi le fait pour M. Yang de savoir que la défenderesse était propriétaire de cet appartement contribuait à établir l'authenticité de leur relation, l'analyse dudit tribunal doit être considérée comme déraisonnable.
[29]
À l'audience, on a demandé au mari où il habiterait s'il était autorisé à s'établir au Canada. Il a répondu qu'il habiterait avec sa femme et ses enfants. Savait-il si sa femme possédait des biens immobiliers au Canada? lui a-t-on ensuite demandé. Il savait qu'elle y avait acheté un appartement, a-t-il confirmé. Lorsqu'on s'est enquis de la manière dont elle avait trouvé la somme nécessaire pour l'acompte, il a expliqué que son frère à lui avait envoyé de l'argent, qu'elle en avait emprunté par ailleurs et que [TRADUCTION] « des invités à la noce [leur avaient] offert de l'argent en cadeau ».
[30]
La décision contrôlée rend compte de ces déclarations:
[40] Le demandeur savait que l'appelante était propriétaire de sa résidence à Toronto et a indiqué que c'est là où lui et son fils habiteraient s'ils immigraient au Canada. Le demandeur a déclaré que la mise de fonds nécessaire à l'achat de l'appartement de copropriété venait d'une somme qui avait été prêtée à l'appelante par son frère et d'argent qui leur avait été donné en cadeaux de mariage [...]
[62] Le demandeur a indiqué que son frère a aidé à financer la mise de fonds pour l'achat de l'appartement de copropriété de l'appelante à Toronto. L'appelante a affirmé que c'est son frère à elle qui lui a prêté cet argent. Quoi qu'il en soit, il reste que l'appelante est propriétaire de cet appartement de copropriété et que le demandeur savait que l'appelante est propriétaire d'un appartement de copropriété à Toronto.
[31]
Lorsqu'on lui a demandé à l'audience quand au juste l'appartement avait été acheté, le mari a répondu que c'était il y a longtemps et qu'il avait oublié la date.
[32]
Étant donné la preuve produite devant lui, le tribunal savait que le mari ne pouvait se rappeler quand exactement la défenderesse avait acheté l'appartement. Le fait de ne pas l'avoir spécifié dans la décision contrôlée n'est pas déraisonnable ni ne constitue une erreur donnant lieu à révision. Qui plus est, le mari savait et a déclaré que l'argent reçu en cadeau de mariage le 31 juillet 2007 avait servi à constituer une partie de l'acompte nécessaire pour l'achat de l'appartement. Il était donc implicite dans son témoignage que l'achat de l'appartement, effectué en avril 2008, était postérieur au mariage.
[33]
Le tribunal n'était pas tenu de préciser dans ses motifs en quoi [TRADUCTION] « le simple fait » pour le mari de la défenderesse de savoir que cette dernière possédait un appartement établissait l'authenticité de leur relation. Ce que le tribunal était tenu de faire, c'était d'examiner et d'apprécier la totalité de la preuve produite devant lui aux fins de décider si leur relation était authentique ou si elle visait principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la LIPR. En l'occurrence, le tribunal a conclu que les faits à retenir étaient les suivants: la défenderesse était propriétaire de l'appartement en question, et son mari savait qu'elle possédait un appartement à Toronto. Ces deux faits, considérés conjointement avec tout le reste de la preuve, ont amené le tribunal à conclure que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le mariage ne visait pas principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la LIPR et qu'il était authentique. Comme le tribunal est présumé avoir pris en considération la totalité de la preuve et l'avoir appréciée correctement [voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 15], et que rien n'indique qu'il ait omis de tenir compte d'aucun élément de ladite preuve, sa conclusion sur cette question est raisonnable.
d) La déclaration de culpabilité de la défenderesse
[34]
S'agissant de l'arrestation et de l'incarcération de la défenderesse, le ministre fait remarquer que le mari de cette dernière ignorait quand et pourquoi elle avait été arrêtée. Le ministre reconnaît que le tribunal ne s'est pas inquiété de cette ignorance et a conclu qu'elle avait peu d'importance, étant donné que M. Yang savait d'un point de vue général que sa femme avait été emprisonnée en Alberta. Cependant, ajoute le ministre, le tribunal avait [TRADUCTION] « l'obligation d'expliquer dans ses motifs pourquoi il n'accordait pas d'importance à cette ignorance », puisqu'il est raisonnable de supposer que les conjoints d'un mariage authentique auraient discuté entre eux d'une telle question.
[35]
Or, le tribunal a bel et bien examiné ce point dans ses motifs:
[63] L'appelante a indiqué en termes généraux que le demandeur était au courant de sa déclaration de culpabilité en Alberta et du fait qu'elle avait été détenue. Dans son témoignage, le demandeur a démontré qu'il savait que l'appelante avait été détenue en Alberta sans toutefois connaître tous les détails de cette affaire. Le demandeur a fourni un témoignage inexact en ce qui concerne la nature du travail de l'appelante en Alberta, ce qui concorde avec la preuve fournie par l'appelante à l'égard du fait qu'elle n'a pas dévoilé certains renseignements concernant sa déclaration de culpabilité au demandeur.
[36]
Le tribunal conclut au paragraphe 67 de sa décision que, à en juger par un examen attentif de la preuve orale et documentaire et selon la prépondérance des probabilités, les contradictions relevées dans la preuve ne discréditent pas les autres éléments tendant à établir l'authenticité du mariage de l'appelante.
[37]
La preuve relative à la déclaration de culpabilité de la défenderesse ne me paraît entachée d'aucune contradiction. Le mari n'était au courant de cet événement que dans les grandes lignes et par conséquent ne pouvait en parler dans son témoignage que de manière générale, parce que la défenderesse ne lui en avait rien dit de plus. En outre, le tribunal a bel et bien expliqué dans ses motifs pourquoi l'ignorance où était le mari du détail des démêlés de la défenderesse avec la justice lui paraissait compréhensible compte tenu des circonstances, tout comme il a précisé que sa décision se fondait sur l'examen de la totalité de la preuve. Il n'était pas tenu d'en faire plus.
[38]
Pour ce qui concerne l'ensemble de la présente demande, la norme du caractère raisonnable applicable à la question de l'objet ou de l'authenticité d'un mariage donne au décideur le droit à un niveau élevé de retenue judiciaire et oblige à interpréter globalement les décisions rendues sur cette question (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, paragraphe 7). Dans la présente espèce, le tribunal a conclu après examen de la preuve que, d'un point de vue global, le mariage de la défenderesse était authentique et n'avait pas été contracté principalement dans le but de permettre à son mari d'acquérir un statut sous le régime de la LIPR. L'étude du dossier ne donne pas à penser que la décision contrôlée n'appartienne pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (voir le paragraphe 47 de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, et le paragraphe 59 de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , également précité).
[39]
Notre Cour a formulé les lignes directrices suivantes touchant les enfants d'un mariage dont l'authenticité est à déterminer:
Lorsque la Commission se penche sur l'authenticité d'un mariage en vertu du paragraphe 63(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, L.C. 2001, ch. 27, elle doit faire preuve d'une grande prudence parce que les conséquences d'une erreur seraient catastrophiques pour la famille. Cela s'avère particulièrement évident lorsque la famille compte un enfant né de la relation [...] La naissance subséquente d'un enfant devrait normalement dissiper toute préoccupation de ce genre [c'est-à-dire touchant l'authenticité].
[...]
La Commission a eu raison de reconnaître que, dans l'évaluation de la légitimité du mariage, il faut accorder un poids considérable à la naissance d'un enfant. Lorsqu'il n'y a pas de doute sur la paternité, il serait raisonnable d'adopter une présomption favorable à l'authenticité du mariage en cause. Il y a de nombreuses raisons d'accorder une grande importance à un tel événement, notamment l'improbabilité que les parties à un faux mariage s'imposent les responsabilités à vie associées au fait d'élever un enfant.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 6 et 8.
[40]
Dans la décision contrôlée, le tribunal a accordé à juste titre un grand poids au fait que la défenderesse et son mari ont eu deux enfants ensemble. Cependant, ce n'est pas là le seul facteur sur lequel il se soit fondé pour conclure que « les incohérences relevées dans la preuve ne port[aient] pas atteinte aux autres éléments de preuve liés à l'authenticité du mariage [...] ». Le tribunal a par exemple récapitulé les faits suivants aux paragraphes 56 à 59 de la décision contrôlée:
- La défenderesse a fait en Chine, après son mariage, un séjour durant lequel elle a habité avec son mari et ses enfants plus de deux mois.
- La défenderesse et son mari communiquent fréquemment.
- Le mari de la défenderesse n'a jamais tenté auparavant de venir s'établir au Canada.
- Aucun élément de preuve convaincant ne donnait à penser que d'autres membres de la famille proche du mari, à part sa femme et son fils cadet, habitent au Canada.
- La défenderesse et son mari ont des projets semblables pour le cas où ce dernier serait autorisé à immigrer au Canada.
- Les conjoints sont compatibles sous les rapports de l'âge, de l'éducation, de l'origine ethnique et du milieu socio-économique.
[41]
Le tribunal a aussi pris en considération des lettres de parents et d'amis des conjoints qui tendent à établir le désir commun de ceux-ci d'être réunis et de vivre en famille.
[42]
Selon les observations formulées devant moi au nom du ministre, le mari de la défenderesse aurait admis que son mariage n'était pas authentique et visait principalement l'acquisition du droit d'entrer au Canada lorsque, au cours de son entretien avec l'agent des visas, il a répondu par l'affirmative à la question suivante de ce dernier: [TRADUCTION] « Il me semble donc que le but de votre mariage est de vivre au Canada? » Or l'agent ne s'est pas arrêté sur cette réponse pour demander des précisions ou des explications. En outre, lorsqu'on lit cette réponse traduite du mari dans le contexte de l'ensemble de l'entretien et de la preuve produite par la suite devant le tribunal, on ne peut à mon sens y voir un aveu qui porterait un coup fatal à la thèse de l'authenticité du mariage.
[43]
La jurisprudence de notre Cour confirme qu'il n'existe aucun critère ou ensemble de critères déterminés pour établir si un mariage ou une union est authentique et qu'il appartient exclusivement à l'agent ou au tribunal administratif de décider du poids relatif à accorder à chacun de ces critères; voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 24;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 23;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 13; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 20. Dans la présente espèce, le tribunal a usé de son pouvoir d'appréciation pour conclure, malgré les contradictions qu'il avait relevées dans la preuve, que le mariage en question était authentique et ne visait pas principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la LIPR.
[44]
Le demandeur fait également valoir le caractère insuffisant de l'analyse et des motifs du tribunal concernant les quatre questions sur lesquelles les témoignages ne concordaient pas. Cependant, la Cour suprême du Canada a récemment posé en principe que l'insuffisance des motifs ne permet pas à elle seule de casser une décision; voir le paragraphe 16 de l'arrêt
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Newfoundland Nurses' Union
], où l'on peut aussi lire ce qui suit:
Le décideur n'est pas tenu de tirer une conclusion explicite sur chaque élément constitutif du raisonnement, si subordonné soit-il, qui a mené à sa conclusion finale (
Union internationale des employés des services, local no 333 c. Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn.
, [1975] 1 R.C.S. 382, p. 391). En d'autres termes, les motifs répondent aux critères établis dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s'ils permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables.
[45]
Comme la Cour l'a déclaré dans le passage suivant de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  cité au paragraphe 21 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Le fait qu'un demandeur qui sollicite un contrôle judiciaire relève des erreurs au sujet de quelques-unes des conclusions de fait de la Commission, ou quelques faiblesses dans l'analyse que cette dernière a faite de la preuve, n'est pas suffisant. La décision sera maintenue si l'on peut juger qu'elle est étayée par d'autres conclusions de fait raisonnablement tirées.
[46]
De plus, le juge Michael M.J. Shore a fait les remarques suivantes, au paragraphe 41 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
La SAI bénéficie de la présomption renversable d'avoir pris en considération la totalité de la preuve dans l'examen du point de savoir si un mariage a été contracté de mauvaise foi:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 31. Selon la jurisprudence de notre Cour, cette présomption peut être renversée si la SAI n'a pas analysé au minimum les éléments de preuve pertinents pour la question en litige qui contredisent sa conclusion sur celle-ci. Rappelons à ce sujet l'observation suivante formulée par le juge John Maxwell Evans dans
Cepeda-Guttierez
, précitée:
[17] (...) plus la preuve qui n'a pas été mentionnée expressément ni analysée dans les motifs de l'organisme est importante, et plus une cour de justice sera disposée à inférer de ce silence que l'organisme a tiré une conclusion de fait erronée « sans tenir compte des éléments dont il [disposait] » [...] Autrement dit, l'obligation de fournir une explication augmente en fonction de la pertinence de la preuve en question au regard des faits contestés.
[47]
Dans la présente espèce, le tribunal a pris en considération les contradictions qui entachaient la preuve et il a conclu que les éléments afférents au mariage l'emportaient sur elles. En définitive, le demandeur est mécontenté par ce qu'il estime être l'insuffisance des motifs formulés sur certains points et par le peu de poids que le tribunal a accordé aux quatre questions sur lesquelles la preuve était contradictoire selon son argumentation.
[48]
La tâche de la cour de révision est d'examiner les motifs de la décision contrôlée et le dossier sur lequel elle se fonde afin d'établir si cette décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables. Ayant ici rempli cette tâche, j'estime que la décision contrôlée, considérée dans son ensemble, est raisonnable. L'analyse et les motifs du tribunal se révèlent suffisants et, de toute façon, ne l'eussent-ils pas été que ce défaut n'aurait pu justifier à lui seul la cassation de la décision contrôlée. En outre, il n'appartient pas à notre Cour d'apprécier à nouveau la preuve. En conséquence, et pour les motifs dont l'exposé précède, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
JUGEMENT
[49] LA COUR STATUE comme suit:
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Il n'a pas été proposé de question de portée générale à la certification, et la présente espèce ne soulève aucune question de cette nature. Il n'est pas adjugé de dépens.
