INTRODUCTION
[1]
Lemieux, J.
: Jacob Fast (the "applicant") received from the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the "Minister") a notice of proposed revocation of his citizenship dated September 4, 1999 (the "notice").
[2]
Mr. Fast had immigrated to Canada in 1947 and had become a Canadian citizen in 1954.
[3]
The notice advised Mr. Fast the Minister intended to make to the Governor-in-Council a report pursuant to sections 10 and 18 of the
Citizenship Act
(the "
Act
") on the following two grounds: 1) You have been admitted to Canada for permanent residence and have obtained Canadian citizenship by false representations or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances in that in 1947 you failed to divulge to Canadian officials responsible for selecting applicants wishing to come to Canada and all other immigration officials:
"1) You have been admitted to Canada for permanent residence and have obtained Canadian citizenship by false representa­tions or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances in that in 1947 you failed to divulge to Canadian officials responsible for selecting applicants wishing to come to Canada and all other immigra­tion officials:
- That you were a German Citizen and therefore an Enemy Alien and inadmis­sible to Canada; and/or
"2) That you have been admitted to Canada for permanent residence and have obtained Canadian citizenship by false representations or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances in that, in 1947, you failed to divulge to Canadian officials responsible for selecting applicants wishing to come to Canada your activities during the Second World War, including:
- Your collaboration with German occupa­tion authorities in Ukraine;
- Your association with the German-spon­sored indigenous auxiliary police forces of Zaporozhye;
- your association with the German Secur­ity Police and Security Service (Sicherheit­spolizei und SD);
OR
- Other wartime activities in which you were involved and which would have rendered you inadmissible to Canada at the time of your coming to Canada."
[4]
On October 29, 1999, Mr. Fast, after having advised, on a without prejudice basis, the Minister he wanted her to refer, in accor­dance with the
Act
and the Notice, the case to the Federal Court Trial Division, filed, in this Court, an application for judicial review.
[5]
In that application, Mr. Fast seeks the following remedies:
(a) an order quashing the notice;
(b) an order prohibiting the respondent Minister from referring the case to this Court;
(c) an order prohibiting the Minister from reporting to the Governor-in-Council that he has either been admitted to Canada for permanent residence or obtained his Cana­dian citizenship by false representations or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances.
[6]
On December 3, 1999, the Minister and the Attorney General for Canada applied to this Court to dismiss or strike Mr. Fast's application for judicial review.
[7]
On March 3, 2000, the Minister referred the case to this Court pursuant to rules 169 and 171 of the
Federal Court Rules
, 1998, (the "Rules") by filing a statement of claim in court file T-453-00 naming Jacob Fast as defendant and seeking from this Court, pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Act
, a finding that Mr. Fast had obtained his Cana­dian citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances.
THE LEGISLATION
[8]
The relevant provisions of the
Citizen­ship Act
of 1976 in force
at this time
are sections 10 and 18. They read:
"10(1) Subject to section 18 but notwith­standing any other section of this Act,
where the Governor-in-Council, on a report from the Minister, is satisfied that any person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship under this Act by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances
,
(a)
the person ceases to be a citizen
, or
(b) the renunciation of citizenship by the person shall be deemed to have had no effect,
as of such date as may be fixed by order of the Governor-in-Council with respect thereto.
"10(2) Presumption
"(2) A person
shall be deemed to have obtained citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances if the person was lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence
by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material cir­cumstances
and, because of that admission, the person subsequently obtained citizen­ship.
1974-75-76, c. 108, s. 9.
"18(1)
The Minister shall not make a report under section 10 unless the Minister has given notice of his intention to do so to the person in respect of whom the report is to be made and
(a) that person does not, within thirty days after the day on which the notice is sent, request that the Minister refer the case to the Court; or
(b) that person does so request
and the Court decides that the person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship by false representation or
fraud or by knowingly
concealing material
circumstances.
"18(2) Nature of notice
"(2)
The notice referred to in subsection (1) shall state that the person in respect of whom the report is to be made may, within thirty days after the day on which the notice is sent to him, request that the Minister refer the case to the Court, and such notice is sufficient if it is sent by registered mail to the person at his latest known address.
"18(3) Decision final
(3) A decision of the Court made under subsection (1) is final and, notwithstanding any other Act of Parliament, no appeal lies therefrom.
1974-75-76, c. 108, s. 17." (emphasis mine)
"10(1) Sous réserve du seul article 18, le gouverneur en conseil peut, lorsqu'il est convaincu, sur rapport du ministre, que l'acquisition, la conservation ou la répudia­tion de la citoyenneté, ou la réintégration dans celle-ci, est intervenue sous le régime de la présente loi par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration ou de la dissimu­lation intentionnelle de faits essentiels, prendre un décret aux termes duquel l'in­téressé, à compter de la date qui y est fixée :
a) soit perd sa citoyenneté;
b) soit est réputé ne pas avoir répudié sa citoyenneté.
"10(2) Présomption
"(2) Est réputée avoir acquis la citoyenneté par fraude, fausse déclaration ou dissimula­tion intentionnelle de faits essentiels la personne qui l'a acquise à raison d'une admission légale au Canada à titre de résident permanent obtenue par l'un de ces trois moyens.

a) l'intéressé n'a pas, dans les trente jours suivant la date d'expédition de l'avis, demandé le renvoi de l'affaire devant la Cour;
b) la Cour, saisie de l'affaire, a décidé qu'il y avait eu fraude, fausse déclaration ou dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels.
"18(2) Nature de l'avis
"(2) L'avis prévu au paragraphe (1) doit spécifier la faculté qu'a l'intéressé, dans les trente jours suivant sa date d'expédi­tion, de demander au ministre le renvoi de l'affaire devant la Cour.

ANALYSIS
I.
The definition of the issues
(a)
The test on a motion to strike
[9]
There is no doubt the burden on the Minister and the Attorney General for Canada is a heavy one in order to succeed on this motion to strike Mr. Fast's applica­tion for judicial review. The reason this is so is because the courts have said the proper way to contest an application for judicial review which a respondent thinks is without merit is to appear and argue at the hearing of the judicial review application.
[10]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), Strayer, J.A., said the Court could, however, strike a judicial review application "which is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success". He added that "such cases must be very exceptional and cannot include cases such as the present where there is simply a debatable issue as to the adequacy of the allegations in the notice of motion".
[11]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), is an example where a judicial review application was struck. In that case, the Federal Court of Appeal did so because it was of the opinion the application for judicial review "could not possibly succeed".
(b)
The basis for the motion to strike by the Minister and the Attorney Gen­eral
[12]
The Minister and the Attorney General of Canada advanced two main grounds justifying striking at this stage Mr. Fast's application for judicial review. First, they say the application is not justiciable because the notice and, for that matter, this Court's decision on the reference, whatever it may be, does not affect Mr. Fast's rights and, in that context, the notice is not an exercise of jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under the
Act
within the meaning of section 2 of the
Federal Court Act
. Second, the application for judicial review cannot succeed because it is barred by section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
since the refer­ence made by the Minister to this Court is an alternative route, an appeal as such, pre­scribed by Parliament which must be pur­sued rather than by way of judicial review.
[13]
As a backup alternative agreement, the Minister and the Attorney General for Canada argued, at the very least, the applica­tion for judicial review attacking ground 1 of the notice should be struck because German citizens were prohibited, as enemy aliens, from coming to Canada in 1947.
(c)
The position advanced by Mr. Fast
(i) Overview
[14]
Mr. Fast's counsel argued the motion to strike his judicial review application should fail because it does not fit within the narrow exception carved out in
David Bull Labora­tories
, supra, i.e., one which is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success.
[15]
To demonstrate their proposition, coun­sel to Mr. Fast explained the basis or merits of the judicial review application which they had launched.
(ii) Ground one - no adequate notice
[16]
Counsel for Mr. Fast based their argu­ments on this point by referring to three decisions of this Court in revocation of citizenship cases: (1)
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 154 F.T.R. 241 (2)
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and (3)
Canada (Minister of Citi­zenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 171 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.).
[17]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Mr. Justice Noël, then with the Trial Division, established two principles about the significance of the notice. First, he said the matter referred to this Court by the Minister under section 18 of the
Act
is the case as set out by the Minister in the notice. As a result, it was not open to the Minister in a reference before the Court to seek a determination on an issue that does not come within the case as set out by the Minister in her notice. Second, while section 18 of the
Act
does not specify the extent of the notice to be given, that notice must convey to the person both the essence of the alleged false representation which is said to have taken place and the intent to seek revocation as a result thereof. Mr. Justice Noël based his conclusion that under subsections 18(1)(a) and (b) of the
Act
, the notice presents the person with a choice of either not responding to the notice or re­questing the Minister to refer the case to the Court. His view was that in order for the person affected to decide which course of action to choose, he or she must know what is said to have been concealed or misrepresented.
[18]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Mr. Justice MacKay of this Court said the notice of revocation must be considered significant in defining, albeit in brief terms, the basis of the Minis­ter's decision to seek revocation of the citizenship of the defendant. Where a person does not request a referral of the matter to this Court, he concluded it is the notice of revocation which sets the framework for any subsequent report to the Governor-in-Council by the Minister recommending revocation of citizenship of the person concerned. He wrote this at paragraph 20 of his decision:
"I agree with Noël, J., that within the scope, or the purview, or the framework set by the terms of the Notice of Revoca­tion, the Summary of facts and evidence (
or under the current Rules, the Minister's Statement of claim
) may provide particu­lars that the Minister will seek to establish in relation to the general terms in the Notice. Insofar as those later filed state­ments allege facts outside the scope of the Notice of Revocation, those allegations are extraneous, and irrelevant to the issue defined for the Court, and for the defen­dant, by the Notice of Revocation." (em­phasis mine)
[19]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Mr. Justice McKeown ruled on an allegation the defendant's service in the Waffen SS did not come within the ambit of the notice of revocation directed at him. He did so in these words at paragraph 11 of his decision:
"In my view, the allegation that Mr. Podins collaborated with German author­ities by virtue of his membership in the Waffen SS does not come within 'the case' as set out in the notice. The notice spe­cifies that the 'collaboration' attributed to the defendant pertains to his alleged mem­bership in the Latvian Auxiliary Police and his 'work in such capacity'. This wording in effect limits the scope of the allegedly collaborationist activities to Mr. Podins' employment at Valmiera EG, and pre­cludes the introduction of the other allega­tions post-dating that period.
As the 'case' against Mr. Podins does not encompass allegations of membership in the Waffen SS, it is not necessary to make findings of fact on that issue.
" (emphasis mine)
[20]
Based on these authorities, counsel to Mr. Fast take aim at the notice issued to him for several reasons with the principal one focussed at the basket allegation "or other wartime activities in which you were involved and which would render you in­admissible to Canada at the time of your coming to Canada". This catch-all, as they describe it, indicates the Minister is propos­ing to revoke Mr. Fast's citizenship for reasons unknown to her and necessarily unknown to Mr. Fast who, because of the vagueness of this ground, has no way of knowing what he is said to have concealed or misrepresented.
[21]
Counsel to Mr. Fast do not limit their attack on the notice to the basket allegation. They allege the use of the words "including" in the second paragraph of the notice sug­gests that activities not set out in there could be the basis of the alleged misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment. Moreover, they say the use of the words "collaboration" and "association" in that paragraph are too vague and uncertain to allow Mr. Fast to know what he is alleged to have concealed or misrepresented.
[22]
As a result, Mr. Fast argues the Minis­ter acted beyond her jurisdiction in issuing the notice which is inconsistent with section 18 of the
Act
in that it does not fairly con­vey to Mr. Fast what he is alleged to have concealed or misrepresented.
(iii) Ground two - Irrelevant con­sideration - the 1947 immigration process
[23]
Mr. Fast argues the Minister committed a jurisdictional error because of an extraneous consideration in alleging he made a misrepresentation in 1947 to immigration officials. Such a misrepresentation, if one was made, is irrelevant, it is said, because there is no allegation by the Minister that Mr. Fast lied during the processing of his citizenship application in 1954.
[24]
The foundation for this argument is based on how the 1946
Citizenship Act
(the "old Act") was written and under which Mr. Fast obtained his citizenship in 1954 in contrast with the current
Citizenship Act
which came into force in 1976 containing the deeming provision of subsection 10(2) relating to permanent residence and tying it with the citizenship acquisition process which the old Act did not have.
[25]
This argument involves complex notions of accrued or accruing rights under the old Act and recourse to various provisions of the
Interpretation Act
as to the effect of the repeal of an enactment on substantive rights. Counsel for Mr. Fast acknowledges, how­ever, that this issue was considered by Mr. Justice MacKay of this Court in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 133 (T.D.) where he deter­mined that sub­stantive rights in relation to the acquisition of citizenship are subject to legislation in force at the time citizenship is acquired.
[26]
Mr. Justice MacKay acknowledged that while there was no equivalent to subsection 10(2) in the old Act, as it applied in 1954 in the case before him, he held this subsection simply provides for an evidentiary presump­tion, a matter of procedure covered by para­graph 44(d)(iii) of the
Interpretation Act
with the result a reach-back was permissible.
(iv) Ground two - Irrelevant con­siderations - Security reasons
[27]
Mr. Fast further attacks the notice arguing the allegation in the notice states that, in 1947, he failed to divulge to Cana­dian officials responsible for selecting in­dividuals wishing to come to Canada his activities during the Second World War. He says this allegation amounts to an extraneous jurisdictional error because in 1947, im­migration officials did not have legal author­ity to reject an applicant on these stated grounds.
[28]
The backdrop to this argument is the structure of the
Immigration Act
as it was in force in 1947 and the scope as well as the applicability of various orders in council made under that existing statute at the time. Also involved in the consideration of this issue is whether, absent statutory authority, the royal prerogative governing entry of persons to Canada could be relied upon.
[29]
In support of their argument on this point, counsel to Mr. Fast refers to three decisions of this Court in citizenship revoca­tion cases where the issue was discussed and decided. Those cases are <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra,
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 163 F.T.R. 240 (T.D.), a decision of Nadon, J., and
Canada (Minister of Citi­zenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 169 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.), a decision of Lutfy, J., as he then was.
[30]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Mr. Justice Noël came to the conclusion that in July 1948, there was no authority under the
Immigration Act
then in force and the orders in council passed under that Act to reject prospective immigrants on the grounds they had collab­orated with the enemy. He also came to the conclusion Parliament, in enacting the
Immi­gration Act
, entirely displaced the royal prerogative which might have been the basis for the rejection of potential immigrants on security grounds.
[31]
Mr. Justice Noël wrote:
"While at common law, no alien immigrant had a right to enter Canada, the
Immigra­tion Act
in force in 1948 determined the eligibility of prospective immigrants. In the case of the respondent, it was decided by an immigration officer in July 1948 that he complied with the provisions of the
Act
and that he met the conditions prescribed by the applicable orders in council. As such, he became entitled to enter Canada. That he would have been barred from entry if he had truthfully disclosed his past by reference to considerations which were extraneous to the
Act
and the applicable orders in council cannot alter the fact that he was lawfully admitted to Canada."
[32]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Nadon said at paragraph 111 of his decision:
"In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  coun­cil p. C. 1950-2856, there was no authority under the
Immigration Act
, 1927, and the orders in council enacted thereunder, to refuse entry into Canada of immigrants on security grounds. I agree with the view taken by Noël, J. However, on August 14, 1951, when the respondent was landed in Canada, there was clearly a legal basis to refuse entry to immigrants who did not meet the security requirements."
[33]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Lutfy, J. (now A.C.J.), was satisfied on the basis of Orders in Council p. C. 4849 and p. C. 4851 that, in December 1948, immigration officers had the legal authority to prohibit the landing into Canada of immigrants on grounds they were either undesirables or security risks, a conclusion which he said was fully consist­ent with the prohibition against the entry of persons who do not fulfill, meet or comply with the conditions and requirements of any regulation found in subsection 3(1) of the then
Immigration Act
. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Mr. Justice Lutfy considered <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and concluded the applicant's submissions in the case before him differed substantially from those which had been argued before Mr. Justice Noël in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra. He also distin­guished Mr. Justice McKeown's decision in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), on the basis that the issue of legal author­ity had not been raised in any signifi­cant way in that case.
II.
Application to this case
[34]
The issue in this case is whether the Minister and the Attorney General of Canada have met the burden of the
Bull Labora­tories
test.
(a)
First ground - No justiciable issue and no exercise of statutory power
[35]
In my view, the Minister and the Attor­ney General have not, on this first ground, demonstrated that Mr. Fast's judicial review application has no possibility of success and that the grounds of no justiciability and no exercise of statutory power are not suffi­ciently strong to enable this Court to dismiss that application. My reasons are twofold.
[36]
First, while I am satisfied the Minister's notice gave Mr. Fast the substance of his alleged misrepresentations, sufficient for him to decide whether he should or should not elect for a reference, I am, nevertheless, troubled by the openness of the basket alle­gation and the flexibility which the Minister has reserved upon herself to include other activities than those specified in the notice. It is debatable whether the allegations as framed meet the requirements established by Mr. Justice Noël in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, and Mr. Justice MacKay in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.
[37]
I, nevertheless, see no substance in Mr. Fast's argument that he did not appreciate what was meant in the notice as to his col­laboration or association with the German wartime authorities.
[38]
Counsel for the Minister and the Attor­ney General placed great emphasis in argument that Mr. Fast's rights were not affected and, therefore, his judicial review application was not justiciable. Counsel relied on the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 385; 13 C.R.(3d) 1 (Eng.); 15 C.R.(3d) 315 (Fr.); 50 C.C.C.(2d) 353, for the proposition that certiorari will not lie as a remedy unless the public body has power to decide any matter affecting the rights, interests, prop­erty, privi­leges or liberties of any person.
[39]
It is debatable, particularly, whether these two cases relied upon by counsel for the Minister and the Attorney General apply in the context of Mr. Fast's argument which focusses on the necessity of compliance with a statutory requirement related to the adequacy of the content of the prescribed notice.
[40]
I am further not satisfied the Minister and the Attorney General have made out a case the Minister, in issuing the notice, was not exercising a statutory power contem­plated by section 2 of the
Federal Court Act
and, in this respect, the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), are apt.
[41]
Second, on the face of the record, relying upon several decisions of this Court in revocation cases, it cannot be said no debatable issue arises on Mr. Fast's argu­ments that what he may or may not have said to immigration officials in 1947 when he applied to immigrate to Canada were extraneous to the acquisition of his citizen­ship in 1954. Furthermore, in my view, it cannot be clearly said the authority of immi­gration officials to exclude him on security grounds was not fairly arguable.
[42]
Standing alone, these issues would warrant further analysis by this Court on the hearing of Mr. Fast's judicial review applica­tion on its merits. I find the words of Mr. Justice Strayer in
Bull  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , quite fitting that a motion to strike does not cover cases where there is a debatable issue as to the adequacy of allegations.
(b)
Second ground - What a reference to this Court means in the context of section 18.5
[43]
The Minister and the Attorney General invoked, as a second alternative ground, the provisions of section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
which excludes from judicial review cases where an appeal as such is provided for by Parliament in another man­ner. Specifically, the Minister and the Attor­ney General argue that the reference to this Court is that other way.
[44]
Section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
reads:
"18.5 Notwithstanding sections 18 and 18.1,
where provision is expressly made by an Act of Parliament for an appeal as such to the Court
, to the Supreme Court of Canada, to the Court Martial Appeal Court, to the Tax Court of Canada, to the Gov­ernor-in-Council or to the Treasury Board
from a decision or order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal made by or in the course of proceedings before that board, commission or tribunal, that decision or order is not, to the extent that it may be so appealed, subject to review
or to be restrained, prohibited, removed, set aside or otherwise dealt with, except in accordance with that Act." (emphasis mine)
"18.5 Par dérogation aux articles 18 et 18.1, lorsqu'une loi fédérale prévoit expressément qu'il peut être interjeté appel, devant la Cour fédérale, la Cour suprême du Canada, la Cour d'appel de la cour martiale, la Cour canadienne de l'impôt, le gouverneur en conseil ou le Conseil du Trésor, d'une décision ou d'une ordonnance d'un office fédéral, rendue à tout stade des procédures, cette décision ou cette ordonnance ne peut, dans la mesure où elle est susceptible d'un tel appel, faire l'objet de contrôle, de restriction, de prohibition, d'évocation, d'annulation ni d'aucune autre intervention, sauf en conformité avec cette loi."
[45]
The debate between the parties focussed on the meaning of the words "an appeal as such" in section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
. Counsel for the Minister and the Attorney General favoured a broad interpretation of these words relying principally on the decision of my colleague Mr. Justice McKeown in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 249 N.R. 76 (F.C.A.) in order to preserve the right of judicial review. They argued even where an appeal is provided for by statute, the decision in issue may be judicially reviewed on a ground that cannot be the subject of the appeal relying upon
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).
[47]
They construed the word "appeal" as the review of the decision of an inferior body by Superior Court for the purpose of testing the soundness of the decision and said the determination by this Court on the reference from the Minister is not a review of the Minister's decision to issue the notice of revocation but rather a fact-finding process designed to determine whether Mr. Fast has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances in the manner alleged in the notice of revocation. Moreover, the reference does not "finally determine any legal rights".
[48]
This issue of the proper meaning of the words "an appeal as such" is to be resolved as a matter of statutory interpretation and, in this context, it is useful to recall the approach established by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1, where Mr. Justice Iacobucci said at p. 41, citing with approval Elmer Driedger in
Construction of Statutes
, (2nd Ed. 1983):
"Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
Act
, the object of the
Act
, and the intention of Parliament."
[49]
The nature of the decision which a judge of this Court is called upon to render is spelled out by Parliament in paragraph 18(1)(b) in these terms "... and the Court decides that the person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances". If this Court makes a finding, in a particular case based upon the evidence adduced and necessary legal findings that the statutory requirement has not been met, the Minister cannot make a report to the Governor-in-Council and the Governor-in-Council cannot consider whether that person's citizenship should be revoked. In other words, a negative finding by this Court is a bar to revocation of citizenship and consequently deportation from Canada.
[50]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 413, characterized the decision which this Court makes under paragraph 18(1)(b) as "a very particular kind of decision" quoting to the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.R.R.(2d) 149 (F.C.A.), at p. 152 as follows:
"... there is no conflict at all between s. 18(3) and s. 27(1). First, this decision is not a 'final judgment' of the Court, nor is it an 'interlocutory judgment'. Although the decision followed a hearing at which much evidence was adduced, it was merely a finding of fact by the court, which was to form the basis of a report by the minister and, eventually, a decision of the Governor-in-Council, as described by s. 10 and 18(1). The decision did not finally determine any legal rights."
[51]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reference judge would make during the course of a reference. At paragraph 56 of its decision, the Supreme Court of Canada said this:
"Although the issue does not arise here, there is a great deal of force to the argument that s. 18(1) of the
Citizenship Act
encompasses not only the ultimate decision as to whether citizenship was obtained by false pretences, but also those decisions made during the course of a s. 18 reference which are related to this determination. This would encompass all the interlocutory decisions which the court is empowered to make in the context of a s. 18 reference (see, for instance, s. 46 of the
Federal Court Act
and Rules 5, 450-455, 461, 477, 900-920, 1714 and 1715 of the
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C., c. 663). This interpretation of s. 18(1) was adopted by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, where it was held that interlocutory decisions made in the context of s. 18(1) reference are decisions made 'under' s. 18(1). It is not necessary for the purpose of this decision to determine whether this conclusion should be varied. That should only be done in an appeal where the issue arises from the facts."
[52]
At paragraph 59 of its decision, the Supreme Court of Canada added this:
"Furthermore, it may be that allowing appeals from interlocutory decisions made in the context of a s. 18 reference would effectively defeat Parliament's goal of finality in citizenship matters. As McLachlin, J., observed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , there is a valid policy concern to control the 'plethora of interlocutory appeals and the delays which inevitably flow from them' (p. 641)."
[53]
In my view, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, define the approach to the question of whether a reference can be said to be an appeal for the purposes of section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
. As I see it, a reference is effectively a trial to determine, as a matter of fact, whether a person has obtained his/her citizenship in a manner proscribed by Parliament. During that trial, which is conducted through the avenue of an action under Part 4 of the Rules, a judge is necessarily called upon to make numerous procedural and evidentiary rulings as well as to make findings of law and this was recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.
[54]
I adopt the principles established by Justice McKeown in
Canada Post
, supra. They were:
(1) The purpose and intent of Parliament in enacting section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
was two-fold: First, the rationale behind this section is to ensure the party seeks a remedy specifically prescribed by Parliament in the statute governing the proceedings rather than resorting to judicial review under section 18.1; and, the second purpose is to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings;
(2) whether a particular process constitutes an appeal for section 18.5 purposes should be viewed by analysing the process substantively and not as a matter of form. The word "appeal" is not a term of art.
(3) An appeal for section 18.5 purposes is a review process whereby the decision made below may be examined as to its soundness. He was of the view an appeal may include a trial de novo, an appeal to the Governor-in-Council, a stated case appeal and traditional appeals upon the record created in the tribunal or court below (p. 237).
(4) Section 18.5 is designed to limit the operation of sections 18 and 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
to cases where no review or appeal is provided in the governing statute.
(5) Relying on the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , jurisdictional issues are not to be dealt with separately from appeal questions. In his view, the Federal Court of Appeal buttressed this proposition in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), where Mr. Justice Urie stated at paragraph 23 of that decision:
"Accordingly, it matters not whether the assessment made on June 3, 1985 is at this stage moot or not. By virtue of s. 29 of the
Federal Court Act
the Trial Division lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief sought in the s. 18 application since the
Income Tax Act
provides the appropriate procedure for appealing the assessment. In those proceedings, all issues relating to the assessment, including its validity and mooteness, may be raised."
[55]
In
Canada Post
, supra, Mr. Justice McKeown struck out a judicial review application because section 44 of the
Access to Information Act
provided a trial de novo.
[56]
Mr. Justice McKeown's approach to what review process constitutes an appeal for section 18.5 purposes is confirmed in the following case law:
(a)
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1995] 101 F.T.R. 238 (T.D.), where Jerome, A.C.J., struck out a judicial review application because the provisions of the
Patent Act
"clearly demonstrate that Parliament has provided a comprehensive scheme for challenging the decisions of the Commissioner of Patents". (para. 3).
(b)
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where Gibson, J., barred an attack on the validity of a notice of assessment because that matter was one which Parliament intended the Tax Court to deal with;
(c)
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Dubé, J., followed Justice McKeown in
Canada Post
, supra;
(d)
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 211 (F.C.A.), where the Federal Court of Appeal sustained the judgment of Pinard, J., who struck a judicial review application from a decision of a citizenship judge refusing his application for citizenship. Stone, J.A., said subsection 14(5) of the
Citizenship Act
provides a comprehensive right of appeal and that the Court was satisfied the questions of jurisdiction of the Citizenship Judge and of the alleged improprieties in the manner in which he dealt with the application for citizenship could be perused on an appeal under section 14(5) and the appropriate remedies granted.
(e)
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where Mr. Justice Rothstein, then with the Trial Division, struck out a judicial review application seeking to challenge and ascertain forfeiture under the
Customs Act
because the
Customs Act
provided a statutory scheme of appeal.
[57]
Based on these authorities which establish a clear line, I am convinced the reference process mandated by paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Act
coupled with Part 4 of the
Rules
which govern references, provides a vehicle whereby the soundness of the notice of revocation issued by the Minister under section 18 of the
Act
can be tested and reviewed on the grounds which Mr. Fast identifies in his judicial review application. Those grounds, it will be recalled, were alleged to be jurisdictional ones related to the adequacy of the notice, irrelevant considerations in the notice which alleges he made a misrepresentation in 1947 to immigration officials and the attack in the notice which states that, in 1947, he failed to divulge to Canadian officials responsible for selecting individuals wishing to come to Canada his activities during the Second World War.
[58]
The second and third grounds advanced by counsel for Mr. Fast have already been the subject of several decisions of this Court in revocation cases because they raised legal issues which necessarily had to be decided before it arrived at the decision which Parliament called upon this Court to make. Those arguments may be put by Mr. Fast in the reference he has requested with the result that his attack on the notice will be reviewed by this Court in that context.
[59]
The first ground relating to the adequacy of the notice has also been the subject of comment in revocation cases, proof that the adequacy of the notice is reviewed in the reference. Mr. Fast wants to strike out the notice on jurisdictional grounds because of the basket allegation and the vagueness of the words collaboration and association. Assuming the Minister made a jurisdictional error in issuing the notice with such alleged defects, clearly, Mr. Fast could challenge the notice under Rule 208 of the
Rules
which now govern references.
[60]
I conclude Mr. Fast's judicial review application could not possibly succeed and must be struck. Clearly, Parliament intended that all matters, including those advanced by Mr. Fast in his judicial review integrally connected to the reference process, be decided within the reference framework.
DISPOSITION
[61]
For all of these reasons, this judicial review application is struck on the grounds that it is barred by section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
. No costs are awarded to the successful respondents.
Application allowed.
