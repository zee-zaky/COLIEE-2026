Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Zinn, J.
: Ms. Bergeron asks the Court to set aside two decisions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission [Commission] which dismissed her two human rights complaints pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(d) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, RSC 1985 c. H-6 [
CHRA
] as "trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith" because they had already been addressed and remedied through two grievance processes.
[2]
Both judicial review applications were heard together. They are largely based on common facts, the records of both, including the decisions, are nearly identical, and the memoranda submitted by the parties are also nearly identical. Accordingly, one set of reasons will issue for both applications, a copy of which will be placed in each of the Court's Files T-315-12 and T-316-12.
Background
[3]
Ms. Bergeron was hired as a lawyer by the Department of Justice Canada [DOJ] in March 1999 and worked there until May 2001, when a chronic illness caused her to leave work.
[4]
She began receiving long-term disability payments in July 2001; however, in 2005, Ms. Bergeron began to discuss a return to work with the DOJ. In August, Ms. Bergeron's physician provided Ms. Bergeron's manager with a medical certificate supporting her return to work and the DOJ referred Ms. Bergeron to a Heath Canada [HC] physician for an assessment. The HC physician solicited and received input from Ms. Bergeron's physician and psychiatrist, who provided their recommendations for a return to work plan. The HC physician's preliminary recommendation was that Ms. Bergeron should gradually return to full-time hours over a period of seven months. This recommendation was provided to Ms. Bergeron's two doctors for their comments. Her physician agreed with the plan for the most part, but wished to see monthly health assessments built into the schedule among other changes. Her psychiatrist initially found the recommendation "eminently reasonable and fair."
[5]
The HC physician provided his final recommendation to the DOJ and Ms. Bergeron on December 3, 2005. It was the same as his initial recommendation, but contained the following statement: "Should [Ms. Bergeron] be unable to maintain the required work hours or additional concerns present themselves, a work stoppage will be necessary and prudent" [the Work Stoppage Clause].
[6]
Ms. Bergeron replied with her concerns about two aspects of the plan: the Work Stoppage Clause and a pre-determined date of return to full-time work. Ms. Bergeron's physician offered similar concerns, and eventually her psychiatrist also indicated a preference for additional flexibility. No consensus could be reached among these doctors and the HC physician's recommendation did not change.
[7]
Ms. Bergeron's manager at the DOJ invited her to meet and discuss her return to work on three occasions: in March, April, and August 2007. Ms. Bergeron refused these invitations on the basis that she wished to have an explicit agreement in place prior to any meeting, and one of the proposed meeting dates was said to offer too little notice.
[8]
Subsequent to the first two of these proposed meetings, by letters dated July 16 and August 13, 2007, Ms. Bergeron's manager formally proposed dates for Ms. Bergeron's return to work, to be approached in accordance with the HC physician's recommendation. Ms. Bergeron refused these offers on the basis that she would be putting her health at risk.
[9]
In May 2008, an Assistant Deputy Attorney General made Ms. Bergeron a final offer to return to work based on the HC physician's recommendation, and informed her that the DOJ otherwise intended to staff her position. The offer removed any reference to full time hours and clarified that any work stoppage decision would only be taken in consultation with the human resources department, the insurance company, and Ms. Bergeron's physicians. Ms. Bergeron rejected the offer. On June 30, 2008, after seven years of absence from work, the DOJ staffed Ms. Bergeron's position.
The Grievances and Complaints
[10]
On July 15, 2008, Ms. Bergeron filed a grievance with the DOJ [the First Grievance] grieving:
on-going discriminatory conduct directed against [her] by [her] manager ... for the better part of three years now and her consistent and persistent failure to provide [her] with ability-appropriate accommodations. The most recent of these ... violations ... [was the] current initiative ... underway to staff [her] permanent position. This individual grievance [was] founded on the application of Sections 2, 3, 7, 14(1)(c) and 15(2) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
.
Ms. Bergeron sought the reversal of the initiative to staff her position; to be restored to her position "with a view to engaging with [her] employer in the identification and development of an approach to this issue which is equitable, acceptable to both parties and non-discriminatory in nature;" and such other relief "deemed appropriate in the circumstances including, but not limited to, compensation for mental/psychological distress and emotional harm."
[11]
On September 26, 2008, Ms. Bergeron filed a human rights complaint with the Commission [the First Complaint]. She alleged that in denying her the chance to attempt the return to work plan she and her physicians preferred, she was discriminated against on the basis of her disability. Ms. Bergeron also claimed that the Treasury Board policy of "maintaining disabled persons on the priority staffing list for only year" was discriminatory, and that as a result of all of this discrimination she had experienced mental distress and the aggravation of her physical symptoms. The Commission's amended "Summary of Complaint" form summarized the complained-of practices to be "adverse differential treatment," "refusal to accommodate," and "discriminatory policy/practice." The Commission's eventual decision regarding the First Complaint is the subject of Court file T-315-12.
[12]
In February 2009, the DOJ proposed another return to work and the extension of Ms. Bergeron's leave-without-pay until April 3, 2009; again, the offer was rejected.
[13]
On March 3, 2009, Ms. Bergeron submitted a second grievance [the Second Grievance] complaining of three actions taken by the DOJ:
(i) The DOJ's refusal to extend her leave of absence without pay which constituted "disciplinary action resulting in financial penalty contrary to s. 209(1)(b) of the
Public Service Labour Relations Act
, discrimination contrary to ss. 7 and 15(2) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and s. 15 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, and retaliation contrary to s. 14.1 of the
CHRA
;"
(ii) The DOJ's refusal to allow her to buy back her pension deficiencies and premiums for her Supplementary Death Benefit during her leave without pay, as well as the DOJ's refusal to continue to make pension contributions and premium payments for her Supplementary Death Benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis, "on the grounds that this comprises disciplinary action resulting in financial penalty pursuant to s. 209(1)(b) of the
Public Service Labour Relations Act
, discrimination - contrary to ss. 7 and 15(2) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and s. 15 of the
Charter
, and retaliation contrary to s. 14.1 of the
CHRA
;" and
(iii) The DOJ's "discriminatory, disciplinary and retaliatory acts against [her] on the ground that these actions have created an unbearable return to work situation for [her], thereby constituting a repudiation of [her] employment contract and amounting to constructive dismissal. ..."
Ms. Bergeron sought assurances that she would not be subjected to further discrimination and retaliation upon her return to work; a written apology from her manager; comprehensive anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training for CIC [
sic
] managers; "compensation for all lost wages and expenses incurred as a result of [the] discriminatory practices, per s. 53 of the
CHRA
;" damages for pain and suffering, "as per s. 53 of the
CHRA
;" compensation for the DOJ's "willful and reckless discriminatory actions ... as per s. 53 of the
CHRA
;" any other corrective action necessary to make her whole.
[14]
On April 27, 2009, Ms. Bergeron filed a second complaint with the Commission [the Second Complaint] alleging that "
since filing her first Human Rights complaint
and her first grievance, she has been subjected to numerous examples of retaliatory conduct by the DOJ [emphasis added]." She stated that in filing this complaint she relied on section 14.1 of the
CHRA
which makes it a discriminatory practice to retaliate or threaten to retaliate against a person who has filed a complaint.
[15]
The Second Complaint lists numerous acts alleged to have been taken in retaliation of the First Compliant. Three of these occurred prior to the date when her First Complaint was filed; namely, (i) letters from the DOJ advising her that it intended to staff her position (May 2008); (ii) being told by her compensation advisor that she was no longer authorized to speak with her and blocked from accessing her human resources information (June 2008); and (iii) letters from the DOJ that it had formally vacated her position (July 2008). The other acts complained of included the DOJ's alleged refusal to accept certain benefits and pension payments from her; the February 6, 2009 "return to work ultimatum (disguised as an "offer" to settle);" an alleged refusal to provide Ms. Bergeron's union with information about why they vacated her position, and stopped paying her Law Society of Upper Canada fees; and the DOJ's decision to place Ms. Bergeron on priority status as of April 6, 2009. The Commission's eventual decision regarding the Second Complaint is the subject of Court file T-316-12.
[16]
Asserting that there was a significant overlap between Ms. Bergeron's two grievances and her two human rights complaints, the DOJ initially raised an objection with the Commission regarding the human rights complaints on the basis of paragraph 41(1)(a) of the
CHRA
, that Ms. Bergeron "ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available" - in particular, the departmental grievance processes she had already initiated.
[17]
Before the Commission reviewed the complaints, Ms. Bergeron received a decision on her First Grievance. After reviewing Ms. Bergeron's written representations (Ms. Bergeron elected not to make oral representations), Donna Miller, Associate Deputy Minister of Justice, found that the DOJ had unsuccessfully corresponded with Ms. Bergeron over the course of two years to coordinate a return to work, that it was incumbent on the department to meet its current and ongoing service requirements, and for those reasons she did not agree with Ms. Bergeron's submission that the decision to eventually staff her position was disguised discipline or a violation of the
CHRA
. Ms. Miller extended a further invitation to Ms. Bergeron to come to an agreement on a return to work plan, and extended her leave-without-pay period for an additional five months, to September 4, 2009, to facilitate that process.
[18]
On July 13, 2009, the DOJ representative assigned to coordinate with Ms. Bergeron on her return to work reiterated the employer's latest offer. Ms. Bergeron's representative's response on September 2, 2009, only two days before Ms. Bergeron's freshly extended leave period was to expire, was that the DOJ must "necessarily" agree to the following elements: a back to work plan devised by Ms. Bergeron's, not HC's doctors; compensatory damages; legal costs; human rights damages for pain and suffering since November 2005; human rights "willful and reckless" damages for conduct since November 2005; and non-monetary redress including, "but not necessarily limited to," a written apology and sensitivity and awareness training for the department's representatives.
[19]
On September 4, 2009, well before the Commission had dealt with the Second Complaint, Ms. Miller replied to the Second Grievance. She lamented Ms. Bergeron's September 2, 2009 reply and "urge[d] [her] to consider providing a more meaningful reply in advancing [her] return to work," and she provided an additional extension to the leave-without-pay period - until October 2, 2009 - to accommodate Ms. Bergeron's counsel's schedule. With respect to the substance of the Second Grievance, she replied as follows:
(i) As to the allegation that the DOJ had refused to extend Ms. Bergeron's leave of absence without pay, Ms. Miller noted that she had extended her leave until September 4, 2009, and, with this decision, once more until October 2, 2009;
(ii) As to the allegation regarding payments that had not been accepted, Ms. Miller indicated the matter was administrative in nature as Ms. Bergeron had provided payments with little explanation and without the required forms, and had provided one cheque when two were required; that these formal requirements had already been explained to her and her representative; and that in any event, the DOJ would accept her payments; and
(iii) Regarding the alleged discriminatory, disciplinary and retaliatory acts, Ms. Miller found "these allegations to be unfounded."
Finally, the September 4, 2009 reply to the Second Grievance reiterated the May 6, 2009 offer and invited Ms. Bergeron or her representative to advance a detailed proposed solution on her return to work "
well before
October 2, 2009 [emphasis added]."
[20]
On October 2, 2009, Ms. Bergeron's counsel replied reiterating the earlier position, quibbling with certain terminology, requesting that Ms. Bergeron's leave-without-pay period be extended for nearly another nine months, "as [the author's] past experience with this file has demonstrated that medically informed and holistic discussions require comfortable and flexible timelines," and concluding with a demand for a response by October 16, 2009.
[21]
The DOJ responded on October 16, 2009, with a response that reflects that the parties were at an impasse:
The Department wishes to advise that it has no further comments to make as it considers this part of the process closed with respect to the letters of Donna Miller of May 6 and September 4, 2009.
[22]
Pursuant to the provisions of the
Public Service Labour Relations Act
, SC 2003, c 22, Ms. Bergeron's union had the right to refer her grievances to adjudication. It chose not to do so. It is suggested that its decision was because the DOJ had "threatened" to make a preliminary objection that would be costly for the union which had only recently been certified to represent DOJ lawyers. In any event, as a consequence of the grievances not being referred to adjudication, the responses from Ms. Miller on the two grievances were final decisions.
The Investigator's Process
[23]
On February 09, 2010, Ms. Falconi, a Commission investigator, wrote to the parties advising them that she was assigned to the First Complaint and Second Complaint and was directed to complete fresh "Section 40/41 Report[s] " regarding the preliminary issues in both complaints. Because the ground had shifted since the DOJ's initial objection, the investigator noted that the complaints raised issues under paragraph 41(1)(d) of the
CHRA
, specifically whether "the grievance procedure adequately addressed the issues raised in the current complaint[s]." She invited the parties to make submissions on the factors relevant to whether the complaints had become, by reason of Ms. Miller's grievance replies, "trivial, frivolous, vexatious or ... in bad faith" as described in paragraph 41(1)(d) of
CHRA
. Specifically, the parties were invited to address the following factors:
(a) What is the nature of the alternate redress mechanism that was used?
(b) Was there a hearing on the issues?
(c) Was the complainant permitted to present his or her case?
(d) Was the decision-maker independent?
(e) What did the decision-maker decide?
(f) Did the decision address all of the human rights issues raised in the complaint?
(g) What remedies were requested in the grievance or other review procedure?
(h) If the complainant was successful (or partially successful) under the alternate redress procedure, what remedies were awarded?
Submissions from the parties ensued, after which the investigator prepared a Section 40/41 Report for each complaint containing a summary of the submissions and facts relevant to each of the above-listed factors, as well as a short analysis and conclusion section. These reports, which recommended the dismissal of the two complaints, were put to the parties for additional submissions, which followed. The reports, the parties' submissions, and other relevant documents were then forwarded to the Commission for decision.
The Commission's Decisions
[24]
The Commission dismissed both of Ms. Bergeron's complaints.
[25]
The Commission's decisions in the First Complaint and Second Complaint (the First Decision and Second Decision, respectively) both have three parts. The first part sets out a brief summary of the procedural history of the case. The second part begins as follows:
"After reviewing and considering the submissions of the parties ..., the Commission adopts the following analysis set out in the Section 40/41 Report."
That statement is followed,
in both decisions
, by the same four paragraph excerpt - the "Analysis" section - from the Section 40/41 Report
prepared for the First Complaint
, which reads as follows:
"The Association of Justice Counsel did not refer the complainant's grievance to arbitration because it expected the respondent would make jurisdictional objections before the [Public Service Labour Relations Board]. It also contended that in the grievance decision, the respondent continued to ignore the complainant's human rights issues. However, despite the respondent's potential objections as well as concluding that her human rights issues were not acknowledged, the [Association of Justice Counsel] still had the option of referring the complainant's grievance to arbitration if it so chose. As well, although the [Associate Deputy Minister] did not find in the complainant's favour in terms of supporting her position that there were human rights violations, it appears that she did turn her mind to the issue. The complainant advised that the [Associate Deputy Minister] is the respondent's human rights expert. She disputes the [Associate Deputy Minister's] objectivity despite the fact that the [Associate Deputy Minister] partially upheld the complainant's grievance and stated her belief that other options were available that would have permitted further discussions between the parties regarding the return to work. The complainant filed her grievance in July 2008, almost 3 years after the initial negotiations were undertaken by the parties regarding the complainant's return to work. For the purposes of the grievance, it appears that the [Associate Deputy Minister] reviewed all documentation that would have also been reviewed at an adjudication hearing.
"While the complainant takes issue with the lack of specifics in the [Associate Deputy Minister's] letter, with respect to the offer to return to her work unit, this does not discount that the offer was made. In addition, the [Associate Deputy Minister] authorized a further period of leave without pay. She authorized it to allow time for the parties to come to an agreement on a return to work plan which could be supported by the complainant's physicians. It was on this basis that the [Associate Deputy Minister] partially upheld the complainant's grievance. She did not award any financial remedy flowing from the CHRA or otherwise.
"Having regard to all circumstances in the complaint, it would appear that all of the issues raised in the complaint were considered and addressed in the grievance decision.
"As well, while the Summary of Complaint identifies a discriminatory policy or practice, the previous complainant's counsel clarified that the complainant was not alleging a discriminatory policy or practice but rather a failure to accommodate."
[26]
The third part of each decision "notes[s] and accept[s] the following arguments ... of the respondent," and another four paragraph excerpt is reproduced. These four paragraphs excerpts differ in each decision, and need not be reproduced. Finally, the decisions conclude by saying that "based on the foregoing, the Commission decides ... to dismiss the complaint on the grounds mentioned in s. 41(1)(d) of the [
CHRA
]."
Issue
[27]
The sole issue raised is the reasonableness of the Commission's decisions. I agree with the parties that the reasonableness standard of review applies when reviewing these decisions.
Analysis
Are the Commission's Decisions Reasonable?
[28]
The preliminary question is this: "What are the Commission's reasons for dismissing Ms. Bergeron's complaints?" The respondent submits that the Commission's reasons for dismissing both complaints consist of the actual reasons the Commission provided to the parties, as summarized above,
and also
the reasons contained in the respective Section 40/41 Reports prepared for each complaint by the investigator, Ms. Falconi. In this regard, the respondent relies on the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at paragraph 21, per MacGuigan J.A., (Décary J.A. concurring)), it is also well established that, for the purpose of a screening decision by the Commission pursuant to subsection 44(3) [as am. by R.S.C., 1985 (1st Supp.), c. 31, s. 64; 1998, c. 9, s. 24] of the Act, the investigator cannot be regarded as a mere independent witness before the Commission (
Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 898 (SEPQA)). The investigator's report is prepared for the Commission, and hence for the purposes of the investigation, the investigator is considered to be an extension of the Commission (SEPQA, at page 898).
When the Commission adopts an investigator's recommendations and provides no reasons or only brief reasons, the courts have rightly treated the investigator's report as constituting the Commission's reasoning for the purpose of the screening decision under subsection 44(3) of the Act
(
SEPQA
, at pages 902-903;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), (2001), 198 D.L.R. (4th) 633 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 43). [emphasis added]
[29]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Commission had adopted the short "Conclusion" sections of the investigator's reports in its decisions. The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the Federal Court that it was appropriate,
in those circumstances
, to treat the entirety of the investigator's reports as the reasoning for the Commission's decisions. However, in the decisions under review in these applications, the Commission adopted the short "Analysis" section of the reports, not the "Conclusion" section. Does that make a difference? Does one look to the remainder of the investigator's reports in these cases even though the conclusion was not the portion of the report that the Commission specifically adopted?
The Second Decision: T-316-12
[30]
The answer to this question as regards the Second Decision must be that one does not look to the remainder of the investigator's report. As mentioned above, and for reasons that have no explanation other than possible inadvertence or because it did not properly turn its mind to the issue, the Commission excerpted the "Analysis" section from the report made for the First Complaint as its reasons for dismissing the Second Complaint. Because the issues were different in the two complaints, the Commission's overt reasons in the second part of the Second Decision are, on their face, irrelevant and unintelligible. The third part of the Second Decision also contains no analysis which is on point: there is no mention, let alone analysis, of whether Ms. Miller's decision on the Second Grievance adequately dealt with whether Ms. Bergeron was retaliated against for having filed the First Complaint, such that the Second Complaint had become "trivial, frivolous, vexatious or ... in bad faith."
[31]
I cannot agree with the submission of the respondent that if the overt reasons alone do not support the conclusion reached, that this Court look to the report prepared for the Second Complaint as the Commission's reasons for the Second Decision.
[32]
It is one thing to go behind an excerpt contained in a decision from an investigator's report and to look at the remainder of that report, as was done in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It is an entirely different proposition to ignore that the Commission (apparently) adopted an excerpt from the wrong report and then look to an altogether different report as the 'real' reasons for the Commission's decision. To do so goes beyond "supplementing" the Commission's decision. It would be rewriting the decision.
[33]
For that reason, and since the third part of the Commission's decision contains no relevant analysis, the Second Decision - that under review in Court File T-316-12 - will be quashed and remitted to the Commission for reconsideration. I reach that conclusion notwithstanding that roughly a third of the alleged incidents of retaliation in Ms. Bergeron's Second Complaint took place before the First Complaint was even filed, because it remains to be determined by the Commission whether the remaining allegations were adequately dealt with by Ms. Miller's reply to the Second Grievance such that the Second Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(d) of
CHRA
or dealt with in some other manner.
[34]
I must therefore allow application T-316-12.
The First Decision: T-315-12
[35]
Unlike the Second Decision, in the First Decision the Commission excerpted the "Analysis" passage from the report that was actually prepared for the First Complaint. Accordingly, the principle in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the remainder of the investigator's report constitutes the Commission's reasoning must be applied unless there is a reasonable basis to distinguish it.
[36]
Had the Commission only adopted a small part of the report's "Analysis" section, such that it was reasonably clear that it preferred only certain reasons from the report and not others, the result might be different. However, here the Commission adopts the entire "Analysis" section, and there is no reason to believe that the Commission did not mean, in effect, to adopt the entire report. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the entire report and not merely the excerpt expressly adopted by the Commission when assessing the First Decision.
[37]
As mentioned, the investigator invited the parties to make submissions on the factors relevant to whether the First Complaint was "trivial, frivolous, vexatious or ... in bad faith" by reason of the "the grievance procedure [having] adequately addressed the issues raised." To repeat, those factors were:
(a) What is the nature of the alternate redress mechanism that was used?
(b) Was there a hearing on the issues?
(c) Was the complainant permitted to present his or her case?
(d) Was the decision-maker independent?
(e) What did the decision-maker decide?
(f) Did the decision address all of the human rights issues raised in the complaint?
(g) What remedies were requested in the grievance or other review procedure?
(h) If the complainant was successful (or partially successful) under the alternate redress procedure, what remedies were awarded?
[38]
These factors are aimed at determining whether a claim has, in substance, already been determined by another mechanism such that the Commission should refuse to deal with it again. The provision permits there to be some divergence as to the exact issues raised, remedies available, procedure used, and so on, in the two mechanisms, or else the use of another non-identical but similar alternative mechanism to that provided under the
CHRA
would not prevent a litigant from seeking recourse at the Commission.
[39]
The jurisprudence is clear that the Commission is to be afforded great latitude in exercising its judgment and in assessing the appropriate factors when considering the application of paragraph 41(1)(d) of the
CHRA
and performing this "screening function:" See, e.g., <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 38.
[40]
The report prepared for the First Complaint summarized the facts and the parties' arguments and can itself be summarized as follows:
(a) The alternative procedure was the DOJ grievance process;
(b) "There was no hearing on the issues because the grievance did not go to arbitration;"
(c) The complainant was permitted to fully present her case in the grievance process;
(d) The complainant argues the decision-maker was not independent (there is no analysis of this issue);
(e) Ms. Miller decided there was no disciplinary action or violation of the
CHRA
; that the DOJ's actions were necessary to meet operational requirements; and that discussions could not go on indefinitely (Ms. Miller noted that several attempts had been made by the department over the course of several years, implicitly saying that Ms. Bergeron had not been particularly cooperative in the accommodation process);
(f) "It appears that [Ms. Miller] turned her mind to the [human rights] issues;" and
(g) Similar remedies were requested in the grievance to those requested in the human rights compliant.
The "Analysis" section of the report is reproduced at paragraph 25 of these reasons. The report concluded that Ms. Bergeron's allegations "were addressed" through the grievance process.
[41]
While the Commission's reasons in the First Decision as contained only in the letter given to the parties are far from perfect; the record before it and, in particular, the Section 40/41 Report prepared for the First Complaint, amply supports its conclusion. Through her First Grievance, Ms. Bergeron had raised virtually the same issues as she raised in the First Complaint; she had asked for virtually the same relief; she had the opportunity to present her case (although she did not even fully avail herself of that right); she received a decision which made a finding on her allegations that there was a failure to accommodate (although, largely because of her own delay, it dismissed them); and she received another 'let's negotiate' back-to-work offer which evidenced that, in fact, the accommodation process was still on-going and that therefore, in law, her complaint was not yet ripe.
[42]
The one truly different issue raised in Ms. Bergeron's First Complaint and which was not raised and therefore dealt with in the grievance process was whether the unnamed Treasury Board policy of "maintaining disabled persons on the priority list for only one year" was discriminatory. However, Ms. Bergeron's submissions in response to the Section 40/41 Report prepared for the First Complaint did not seriously pursue the argument that the Treasury Board policy would be dealt with if her complaint was dismissed; nor was that issue pursued by Ms. Bergeron in this judicial review. Thus, in addition to the fact that whether the exact issues were raised in both processes is but one factor in the 41(1)(d) analysis, the issue of the Treasury Board policy is of negligible significance in this Court's review of the Commission's decision.
[43]
Moreover, although at all times Ms. Bergeron has complained that the grievance process was not independent and thus cannot be considered to have adequately addressed her complaints, there was no evidence that Ms. Miller was biased or did not decide the grievances impartially; nor, in these circumstances, is the alleged lack of independence in the grievance process sufficient to render the Commission's decision unreasonable: the alleged deficiencies are speculative, and, again, only relate to one factor in the above-mentioned list of factors. Most if not all of the other factors weighed in favour of dismissing the complaint.
[44]
The Commission's decision that Ms. Bergeron's issues had been reasonably dealt with in the grievance process and should not continue to be litigated was therefore well within the range of possible outcomes and should not be disturbed.
[45]
I must therefore dismiss application T-315-12.
JUDGMENT
[46]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review in Court File T-315-12 is dismissed;
2. The application for judicial review in Court file T-316-12 is granted, the Commission's decision is quashed, and the matter is remitted back to the Commission;  and
3. In light of the divided success, there is no order as to costs.

Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
, LRC 1985 c H-6 (la LCDP), ayant conclu que les plaintes étaient « frivole[s], vexatoire[s] ou entachée[s] de mauvaise foi », parce qu'elles avaient déjà été examinées et réglées dans le cadre de deux procédures de règlement des griefs.
[2]
Les deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire ont été instruites ensemble. Elles reposent dans une large mesure sur les mêmes faits; les dossiers de ces deux demandes, y compris les décisions, sont presque identiques; et les mémoires soumis par les parties sont eux aussi presque identiques. Par conséquent, un seul ensemble de motifs sera rédigé pour les deux demandes, dont une copie sera versée dans chaque dossier (soit les dossiers T-315-12 et T-316-12).
Le contexte
[3]
Le ministère de la Justice Canada (JC) a embauché Mme Bergeron à titre d'avocate en mars 1999. Elle y a travaillé jusqu'en mai 2001, une maladie chronique l'obligeant à prendre congé.

Mme Bergeron a commencé à toucher des prestations d'invalidité à long terme en juillet 2001; toutefois, en 2005, elle a amorcé des discussions concernant son retour au travail à JC. En août, le médecin de Mme Bergeron a fourni au gestionnaire de cette dernière un certificat médical favorable à son retour au travail et JC a dirigé Mme Bergeron vers un médecin de Santé Canada (SC) en vue d'une évaluation. Le médecin de SC a demandé et obtenu les avis du médecin et du psychiatre de Mme Bergeron, qui ont formulé leurs recommandations relativement à un plan de retour au travail. D'après la recommandation préliminaire du médecin de SC, Mme Bergeron pourrait revenir progressivement à un horaire à temps plein sur une période de sept mois. Cette recommandation a été soumise aux deux fournisseurs de soins de Mme Bergeron afin d'obtenir leurs avis. Son médecin a approuvé le plan dans une large mesure, mais souhaitait quelques modifications, notamment l'intégration d'examens médicaux mensuels dans le calendrier. Quant au psychiatre de Mme Bergeron, il estimait initialement que la recommandation était [traduction] « tout à fait raisonnable et équitable ».
[5]
Le médecin de SC a soumis sa recommandation finale à JC et à Mme Bergeron le 3 décembre 2005. Elle était identique à sa recommandation initiale, mais contenait l'énoncé suivant: [traduction] « Si [Mme Bergeron] s'avère incapable d'effectuer les heures de travail requises ou si de nouveaux problèmes se manifestent, un arrêt de travail sera nécessaire et prudent » (la clause d'arrêt de travail).
[6]
Mme Bergeron a répondu en faisant valoir ses préoccupations concernant deux éléments du plan: la clause d'arrêt de travail et la date prédéterminée de son retour au travail à temps plein. Le médecin de Mme Bergeron a exprimé des préoccupations similaires et, par la suite, le psychiatre de Mme Bergeron a signalé sa préférence pour un plan plus souple. Aucun consensus n'a pu être établi entre ces professionnels de la santé et la recommandation du médecin de SC n'a pas été modifiée.
[7]
Le gestionnaire de Mme Bergeron à JC l'a invitée à une rencontre pour discuter de son retour au travail à trois reprises: en mars, avril et août 2007. Mme Bergeron a refusé ces invitations en faisant valoir qu'elle souhaitait qu'une entente explicite soit conclue avant toute rencontre; de plus, elle estimait qu'une des dates proposées lui avait laissé un préavis trop court.
[8]
Après les deux premières invitations à une rencontre, dans des lettres datées du 16 juillet et du 13 août 2007, le gestionnaire de Mme Bergeron a officiellement proposé des dates pour le retour au travail de Mme Bergeron, qui se déroulerait conformément à la recommandation du médecin de SC. Mme Bergeron a refusé ces offres en faisant valoir qu'un tel retour au travail pourrait mettre sa santé en péril.
[9]
En mai 2008, un sous-procureur général adjoint a présenté à Mme Bergeron une offre finale de retour au travail basée sur la recommandation du médecin de SC; il l'a avisée que, autrement, JC avait l'intention de doter son poste. L'offre ne comportait plus de renvoi à un horaire de travail à temps plein et précisait que toute décision concernant un arrêt de travail ne serait prise qu'en consultation avec le service des ressources humaines, la compagnie d'assurances et les médecins de Mme Bergeron. Cette dernière a rejeté l'offre. Le 30 juin 2008, après sept années d'absence du travail, JC a doté le poste de Mme Bergeron.
Les griefs et les plaintes
[10]
Le 15 juillet 2008, Mme Bergeron a déposé un grief auprès de JC (le premier grief). Elle contestait:
[traduction]
[...] la conduite discriminatoire continue à [son] égard de la part de [son] gestionnaire [...] depuis presque trois ans maintenant et l'omission constante et persistante de [lui] offrir des mesures d'adaptation en fonction de [ses] capacités. La plus récente de ces [...] violations [...] [était] l'initiative [...] en cours visant à doter [son] poste permanent. Ce grief individuel [était] fondé sur l'application des dispositions 2, 3, 7, 14(1)
c
) et 15(2) de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
.
Mme Bergeron demandait: l'annulation de l'initiative visant à doter son poste; la réintégration à son poste [traduction] « dans la perspective d'une discussion avec [son] employeur visant à déterminer et à élaborer une approche de ce problème qui soit équitable, mutuellement acceptable et dépourvue de discrimination »; d'autres mesures de redressement [traduction] « jugées appropriées dans les circonstances, y compris, mais sans s'y limiter, une indemnisation pour les souffrances morales/psychologiques et le préjudice émotionnel ».
[11]
Le 26 septembre 2008, Mme Bergeron a déposé une plainte relative aux droits de la personne auprès de la Commission (la première plainte). Elle alléguait que, en lui refusant la possibilité d'essayer le plan de retour au travail que ses médecins et elle préféraient, l'employeur faisait preuve de discrimination contre elle sur la base de son incapacité. Mme Bergeron a également soutenu que la politique du Conseil du Trésor consistant à [traduction] « maintenir les personnes handicapées sur la liste de priorité pour seulement un an » était discriminatoire et que, à cause de toute cette discrimination, elle avait subi une souffrance psychologique et une aggravation de ses symptômes physiques. D'après le [traduction] « Résumé de la plainte » modifié de la Commission, les pratiques visées par la plainte étaient les suivantes: [traduction] « le traitement différent et préjudiciable », [traduction] « le refus de prendre des mesures d'adaptation » et [traduction] « une politique ou pratique discriminatoire ». Le dossier de la Cour no T-315-12 porte sur la décision rendue par la Commission concernant cette première plainte.
[12]
En février 2009, JC a proposé un autre retour au travail et la prolongation du congé sans solde de Mme Bergeron jusqu'au 3 avril 2009; encore une fois, l'offre a été rejetée.
[13]
Le 3 mars 2009, Mme Bergeron a déposé un second grief (le second grief), contestant trois mesures prises par JC:
(i) le refus de JC de prolonger son congé sans solde, ce qui constituait [traduction] « une mesure disciplinaire entraînant une sanction pécuniaire en contravention de l'alinéa 209(1)
b
) de la
Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique
, un acte discriminatoire en contravention de l'article 7 et du paragraphe 15(2) de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
et de l'article 15 de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
, et des représailles en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la LCDP »;
(ii) le refus de JC de lui permettre de racheter ses cotisations au régime de retraite et les primes de son Régime de prestations supplémentaires de décès pendant son congé sans solde, ainsi que le refus de JC de continuer de verser les cotisations de pension de retraite et les primes de son Régime de prestations supplémentaires de décès selon la comptabilisation de décaissement, [traduction] « aux motifs que ces refus constituent: une mesure disciplinaire entraînant une sanction pécuniaire aux termes de l'alinéa 209(1)
b
) de la
Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique
; un acte discriminatoire en contravention de l'article 7 et du paragraphe 15(2) de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
et de l'article 15 de la
Charte
; des représailles en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la LCDP »;
(iii) [traduction] « les mesures discriminatoires, disciplinaires et de représailles [de JC] contre [elle], au motif que ces mesures ont créé une situation de retour au travail insupportable pour [elle], ce qui constituait une répudiation de [son] contrat d'emploi et équivalait à un congédiement déguisé. [...] »
Mme Bergeron demandait: des assurances qu'elle ne ferait pas l'objet de nouvelles mesures de discrimination et de représailles à son retour au travail; une lettre d'excuses de la part de son gestionnaire; une formation exhaustive en matière de lutte contre la discrimination et le harcèlement à l'intention des gestionnaires de CIC [
sic
]; [traduction] « une indemnisation pour la rémunération perdue et les dépenses encourues à cause [des] pratiques discriminatoires, conformément à l'article 53 de la LCDP »; des dommages-intérêts pour souffrances et douleurs, [traduction] « conformément à l'article 53 de la LCDP »; une indemnisation pour [traduction] « les mesures discriminatoires délibérées et inconsidérées [de JC] [...], conformément à l'article 53 de la LCDP »; toute autre mesure corrective requise pour la remettre dans sa situation antérieure.
[14]
Le 27 avril 2009, Mme Bergeron a déposé une seconde plainte auprès de la Commission (la seconde plainte), et a allégué que [traduction] «
depuis le dépôt de sa première plainte relative aux droits de la personne
et son premier grief, elle fait l'objet de nombreuses mesures de représailles de la part de JC » [non souligné dans l'original]. Elle a affirmé que, en déposant cette plainte, elle se fondait sur l'article 14.1 de la LCDP qui prévoit que les représailles ou la menace de représailles contre une personne qui a déposé une plainte constituent une pratique discriminatoire.
[15]
La seconde plainte énumère de nombreuses mesures prétendument prises en représailles de la première plainte. Trois sont survenues avant la date du dépôt de la première plainte, soit: (i) les lettres de JC avisant Mme Bergeron que l'employeur prévoyait doter son poste (mai 2008); (ii) la conseillère en rémunération avisant Mme Bergeron qu'elle n'était plus autorisée à lui parler et qu'elle ne pouvait plus accéder à son dossier des ressources humaines (juin 2008); (iii) les lettres de JC l'avisant que l'employeur avait officiellement libéré son poste (juillet 2008). Les autres mesures visées par la plainte incluaient: le refus allégué de JC d'accepter certains paiements de Mme Bergeron liés à ses avantages sociaux et à sa pension de retraite; [traduction] « l'ultimatum de retour au travail (déguisé sous la forme d'une "offre" de règlement) », en date du 6 février 2009; un refus allégué de fournir au syndicat de Mme Bergeron de l'information sur les raisons pour lesquelles JC avait libéré son poste et cessé de payer ses cotisations au Barreau du Haut-Canada; la décision de JC d'assigner à Mme Bergeron le statut de bénéficiaire de priorité en date du 6 avril 2009. Le dossier de la Cour no T-316-12 porte sur la décision rendue par la Commission concernant la seconde plainte.
[16]
JC a initialement soulevé une objection auprès de la Commission concernant les plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne, en signalant le chevauchement important entre les deux griefs de Mme Bergeron et ses deux plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Invoquant l'alinéa 41(1)
a
) de la LCDP, JC a soutenu que Mme Bergeron [traduction] « devrait épuiser d'abord les recours internes ou les procédures d'appel ou de règlement des griefs auxquels elle a normalement accès » - en particulier, les procédures ministérielles de règlement des griefs qu'elle avait déjà amorcées.
[17]
Avant que la Commission n'examine les plaintes, Mme Bergeron a reçu une décision concernant son premier grief. Après avoir examiné les observations écrites de Mme Bergeron (Mme Bergeron a choisi de ne pas présenter d'observations orales), Donna Miller, sous-ministre adjointe de la Justice, a conclu que JC avait correspondu infructueusement avec Mme Bergeron sur une période de deux ans afin de coordonner un retour au travail, qu'il incombait au ministère de respecter ses obligations actuelles et futures au chapitre de la prestation de services, et que, pour ces raisons, elle rejetait l'argument de Mme Bergeron selon lequel la décision de procéder à la dotation de son poste était une mesure disciplinaire déguisée ou une violation de la LCDP. Mme Miller a de nouveau invité Mme Bergeron à conclure une entente sur un plan de retour au travail et a prolongé son congé sans solde d'une période additionnelle de cinq mois, soit jusqu'au 4 septembre 2009, en vue de faciliter une telle entente.
[18]
Le 13 juillet 2009, le représentant de JC chargé de coordonner avec Mme Bergeron le retour au travail de cette dernière a réitéré la plus récente offre de l'employeur. Dans sa réponse en date du 2 septembre 2009, seulement deux jours avant l'expiration du congé de Mme Bergeron qui venait d'être prolongé, le représentant de Mme Bergeron a indiqué que JC devait [traduction] « nécessairement » convenir des éléments suivants: un plan de retour au travail conçu par les médecins de Mme Bergeron, et non par les médecins de SC; des dommages-intérêts compensatoires; le remboursement des dépens; des dommages-intérêts liés à l'atteinte aux droits de la personne pour souffrances et douleurs depuis novembre 2005; des dommages-intérêts liés à l'atteinte [traduction] « délibérée et inconsidérée » aux droits de la personne pour la conduite de JC depuis novembre 2005; des mesures de redressement non financières incluant, [traduction] « mais sans s'y limiter », une lettre d'excuses et une formation en matière de sensibilisation à l'intention des représentants du ministère.
[19]
Le 4 septembre 2009, bien avant que la Commission ne se prononce sur la seconde plainte, Mme Miller a répondu au second grief. Elle s'est dite désolée de la réponse de Mme Bergeron en date du 2 septembre 2009; elle [traduction] « [l'a] exhort[ée] à envisager de soumettre une réponse qui contribuerait de manière plus significative à faciliter [son] retour au travail »; et elle lui a accordé une autre prolongation de son congé sans solde - jusqu'au 2 octobre 2009 - afin de tenir compte des disponibilités de l'avocat de Mme Bergeron. Pour ce qui est du contenu du second grief, elle a répondu ce qui suit:
(i) en ce qui a trait à l'allégation selon laquelle JC avait refusé de prolonger le congé sans solde de Mme Bergeron, Mme Miller a noté qu'elle avait prolongé son congé jusqu'au 4 septembre 2009 et que, dans le cadre de cette décision-ci, elle le prolongeait à nouveau jusqu'au 2 octobre 2009;
(ii) en ce qui a trait à l'allégation concernant les paiements qui avaient été refusés, Mme Miller a signalé ceci: qu'il s'agissait d'une question de nature administrative, étant donné que Mme Bergeron avait envoyé des paiements accompagnés de peu d'explications et sans les formulaires requis, et avait envoyé un chèque tandis qu'il en fallait deux; que ces exigences administratives avaient été communiquées à Mme Bergeron et à son représentant; que, de toute manière, JC accepterait ses paiements;
(iii) en ce qui a trait aux allégations liées aux mesures discriminatoires, disciplinaires et de représailles, Mme Miller a conclu que [traduction] « ces allégations sont dépourvues de fondement ».
Enfin, la réponse, datée du 4 septembre 2009, au second grief réitérait l'offre du 6 mai 2009 et invitait Mme Bergeron ou son représentant à proposer une solution détaillée concernant son retour au travail [traduction] «
bien avant
le 2 octobre 2009 » [non souligné dans l'original].
[20]
Le 2 octobre 2009, l'avocat de Mme Bergeron a répondu en réitérant la position antérieure, en ergotant sur certains termes, en demandant que le congé sans solde de Mme Bergeron soit prolongé à nouveau de presque neuf mois, [traduction] « car, dans ce dossier, l'expérience [de l'auteur] a montré que la tenue de discussions holistiques et éclairées sur le plan médical nécessite un échéancier ample et souple », et en concluant avec l'exigence d'une réponse au plus tard le 16 octobre 2009.
[21]
Le 16 octobre 2009, JC a envoyé une réponse qui reflète l'impasse dans laquelle se trouvaient les parties:
[traduction]
Le ministère souhaite vous aviser qu'il n'a plus d'observations additionnelles à formuler, car il considère que ce volet du processus est terminé pour ce qui est des lettres de Donna Miller datées du 6 mai et du 4 septembre 2009.
[22]
Aux termes de la
Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique
, LC 2003, c 22, le syndicat de Mme Bergeron avait le droit de soumettre les griefs à l'arbitrage. Il a choisi de ne pas procéder ainsi. On a laissé entendre que cette décision découlait de la [traduction] « menace » de JC de présenter une objection préliminaire qui se serait avérée coûteuse pour le syndicat, qui venait récemment d'obtenir l'accréditation pour représenter les avocats de JC. Quoi qu'il en soit, du fait que les griefs n'ont pas été soumis à l'arbitrage, les réponses de Mme Miller aux deux griefs constituaient des décisions définitives.
La démarche de l'enquêteuse
[23]
Le 9 février 2010, Mme Falconi, une enquêteuse de la Commission, a écrit aux parties pour les aviser qu'elle avait été affectée à la première et à la seconde plainte, et qu'elle avait été chargée de rédiger de nouveaux [traduction] « rapports relatifs aux articles 40 et 41 » concernant les questions préliminaires touchant les deux plaintes. Étant donné que le contexte avait évolué depuis l'objection initiale de JC, l'enquêteuse a noté que les plaintes soulevaient des questions aux termes de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la LCDP, plus précisément celle de savoir si [traduction] « la procédure de règlement des griefs traitait adéquatement les questions soulevées dans [les] présente[s] plainte[s] ». Elle a invité les parties à soumettre des observations sur les facteurs se rapportant à la question de savoir si, compte tenu des réponses données aux griefs par Mme Miller, les plaintes étaient devenues « frivole[s], vexatoire[s] ou entachée[s] de mauvaise foi » selon la formulation utilisée à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la LCDP. Plus précisément, l'enquêteuse a invité les parties à se pencher sur les facteurs suivants:
a) Quelle était la nature de l'autre mécanisme de recours qui a été utilisé?
b) Y a-t-il eu une audience consacrée aux questions soulevées par la plainte?
c) La plaignante a-t-elle eu la possibilité de présenter sa position?
d) Est-ce que la décideuse était indépendante?
e) Quelle décision a-t-elle rendue?
f) La décision aborde-t-elle toutes les questions relatives aux droits de la personne soulevées dans la plainte?
g) Quelles mesures de redressement étaient demandées dans le grief ou l'autre mécanisme de recours?
h) Si la plaignante a eu gain de cause (en tout ou en partie) dans le cadre de cet autre mécanisme de recours, quelles mesures de redressement lui ont été accordées?
Les parties ont soumis leurs observations, après quoi l'enquêteuse a préparé un rapport relatif aux articles 40 et 41 pour chaque plainte, comportant un résumé des observations et des faits se rapportant à chacun des facteurs exposés ci-dessus, ainsi qu'une brève analyse et une conclusion. Ces rapports, qui recommandaient le rejet des deux plaintes, ont été soumis aux parties en vue de recueillir des observations additionnelles. Les rapports, les observations des parties et d'autres documents pertinents ont été acheminés à la Commission pour que cette dernière rende sa décision.
Les décisions de la Commission
[24]
La Commission a rejeté les deux plaintes de Mme Bergeron.
[25]
Les décisions de la Commission visant la première plainte et la seconde plainte (la première décision et la seconde décision, respectivement) sont organisées en trois sections. La première section présente un résumé succinct de l'historique des procédures liées au dossier. La deuxième section s'amorce ainsi:
[traduction]
Ayant examiné et pris en considération les observations des parties [...], la Commission adopte l'analyse suivante exposée dans le rapport relatif aux articles 40 et 41.
Cet énoncé est suivi,
dans les deux décisions
, par la même citation de quatre paragraphes - soit la section [traduction] « Analyse » - tirés du rapport relatif aux articles 40 et 41
préparé relativement à la première plainte
. Voici la citation en question:
[traduction]
L'Association des juristes du ministère de la Justice n'a pas soumis le grief à l'arbitrage, parce qu'elle s'attendait à ce que le défendeur présente des objections préliminaires quant à la compétence devant la [Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique]. Elle a également soutenu que, dans la décision sur le grief, le défendeur avait continué de faire abstraction des questions relatives aux droits de la personne soulevées par la plaignante. Toutefois, malgré les objections possibles du défendeur, ayant conclu que l'on n'avait pas tenu compte de questions relatives aux droits de la personne, [l'Association des juristes du ministère de la Justice] avait encore la possibilité de soumettre le grief de la plaignante à un arbitre, si elle le souhaitait. De plus, même si [la sous-ministre adjointe] n'a pas tranché en faveur de la plaignante en ce qui a trait aux allégations d'atteinte aux droits de la personne, elle semble s'être penchée sur cette question. La plaignante a signalé que [la sous-ministre adjointe] est la spécialiste en matière de droits de la personne chez le défendeur. Elle conteste l'objectivité de [la sous-ministre adjointe], malgré le fait que [la sous-ministre adjointe] a partiellement accueilli le grief et déclaré qu'elle croyait que les parties disposaient d'autres solutions possibles pour poursuivre les discussions sur le retour au travail. La plaignante a déposé son grief en juillet 2008, près de trois ans après que les parties avaient entrepris les négociations initiales concernant le retour au travail de la plaignante. Aux fins du règlement du grief, il semble que [la sous-ministre adjointe] a examiné toute la documentation qui aurait été examinée dans le cadre d'une audience d'arbitrage.
Bien que la plaignante conteste le peu de précisions dans la lettre de [la sous-ministre adjointe] en ce qui concerne l'offre de retour au travail, cela ne met pas en doute que l'offre a été présentée. De plus, [la sous-ministre adjointe] a autorisé la prolongation de la période de congé sans solde. Elle a autorisé cette prolongation pour accorder aux parties plus de temps pour s'entendre sur un plan de retour au travail qui aurait l'appui des médecins de la plaignante. Voilà pourquoi [la sous-ministre adjointe] a partiellement accueilli le grief de la plaignante. Elle n'a pas accordé de mesure de redressement de nature financière aux termes de la LCDP ou de toute autre voie de recours.
Compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances signalées dans la plainte, il semblerait que toutes les questions soulevées dans la plainte ont été examinées et abordées dans la décision relative au grief.
De plus, bien que le résumé de la plainte fasse renvoi à une politique ou pratique discriminatoire, l'avocat précédent de la plaignante avait précisé que la plainte ne visait pas une politique ou pratique discriminatoire, mais plutôt l'omission de prendre des mesures d'adaptation.
[26]
Dans la troisième section de chaque décision, l'enquêteuse [traduction] « prend note et admet les arguments suivants [...] du défendeur », puis cite un autre extrait de quatre paragraphes. Ces extraits de quatre paragraphes diffèrent dans chaque décision et il n'est pas nécessaire de les reproduire ici. Enfin, l'enquête conclut les décisions en affirmant que [traduction] « à la lumière de ce qui précède, la Commission décide [...] de rejeter la plainte pour les motifs exposés à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la [LCDP] ».
La question en litige
[27]
La seule question soulevée est de savoir si les décisions de la Commission étaient raisonnables. Je conviens avec les parties que la norme de contrôle applicable à ces décisions est la décision raisonnable.
Analyse
Les décisions de la Commission sont-elles raisonnables?
[28]
La question préliminaire est la suivante: « Pour quels motifs la Commission a-t-elle rejeté les plaintes de Mme Bergeron? » Le défendeur soutient que les motifs pour lesquels la Commission a rejeté les deux plaintes sont les motifs mêmes que la Commission a fournis aux parties, qui sont résumés ci-dessus,
ainsi que
les motifs exposés dans les rapports aux termes des articles 40 et 41 produits pour chaque plainte par l'enquêteuse, Mme Falconi. Ainsi, le défendeur se fonde sur l'arrêt de la Cour d'appel fédérale dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ):
[37] Selon moi, l'argument de l'appelant à cet égard doit être rejeté. Il est vrai que l'enquêteur et la Commission sont deux entités « à bien des égards distinctes » (
Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Pathak
, 1995 CanLII 3591 (CAF), [1995] 2 C.F. 455 (C.A.), au paragraphe 21, le juge MacGuigan (avec l'appui du juge Décary)), mais il est également bien établi qu'aux fins d'une décision de la Commission en conformité avec le paragraphe 44(3) [mod. par L.R.C. (1985) (1er suppl.), ch. 31, art. 64; 1998, ch. 9, art. 24] de la Loi, l'enquêteur n'est pas qu'un simple témoin indépendant devant la Commission (
Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 898 (
SEPQA
)). L'enquêteur établit son rapport à l'intention de la Commission et, par conséquent, il mène l'enquête en tant que prolongement de la Commission (
SEPQA
, à la page 898).
Lorsque la Commission adopte les recommandations de l'enquêteur et qu'elle ne présente aucun motif ou qu'elle fournit des motifs très succincts, les cours ont, à juste titre, décidé que le rapport d'enquête constituait les motifs de la Commission aux fins de la prise de décision en vertu du
paragraphe 44(3) de la Loi (
SEPQA
, aux pages 902 et 903;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2001 CAF 93, au paragraphe 43).
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[29]
Dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Commission avait adopté dans ses propres décisions les brèves sections [traduction] « Conclusion » des rapports de l'enquêteur. La Cour d'appel fédérale a convenu avec la Cour fédérale qu'il était approprié,
dans ces circonstances-là
, de traiter l'ensemble des rapports de l'enquêteur comme étant le raisonnement sous-tendant les décisions de la Commission. Toutefois, dans les décisions visées par les présentes demandes de contrôle judiciaire, la Commission a adopté la brève section [traduction] « Analyse » des rapports de l'enquêteuse, et non la section [traduction] « Conclusion ». Est-ce que cela change quelque chose? Peut-on se reporter aux autres sections des rapports de l'enquêteuse, même si la conclusion n'était pas la section du rapport que la Commission a expressément adoptée?
La seconde décision: T-316-12
[30]
La réponse à cette question en ce qui a trait à la seconde décision doit être la suivante: on ne peut se reporter aux autres sections du rapport de l'enquêteuse. Ainsi qu'il est signalé précédemment, et pour des raisons n'ayant aucune explication, à part peut-être une inadvertance ou l'omission d'examiner la question de manière appropriée, la Commission a cité la section [traduction] « Analyse » du rapport produit pour la première plainte à titre de motifs du rejet de la seconde plainte. Étant donné que les questions soulevées n'étaient pas les mêmes dans les deux plaintes, les motifs fournis par la Commission dans la deuxième section de la seconde décision sont, de prime abord, dépourvus de pertinence et d'intelligibilité. De plus, la troisième section de la seconde décision ne renferme aucune analyse pertinente: il n'y a aucune mention, encore moins une analyse, de la question de savoir si la décision de Mme Miller sur le second grief avait réglé la plainte de Mme Bergeron (selon laquelle elle avait subi des représailles pour avoir déposé la première plainte), si bien que la seconde plainte était devenue « frivole, vexatoire ou entachée de mauvaise foi ».
[31]
Je ne peux souscrire à l'argument du défendeur selon lequel, si les motifs exposés ne suffisent pas à eux seuls pour étayer la conclusion rendue, la Cour peut se reporter aux autres sections du rapport visant la seconde plainte à titre de motifs de la seconde décision.
[32]
C'est une chose que de vérifier un extrait reproduit dans une décision qui est tiré du rapport d'un enquêteur, puis d'examiner le reste de ce rapport, comme on l'a fait dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . C'est tout à fait autre chose que de ne pas tenir compte du fait que la Commission a (apparemment) adopté un extrait du mauvais rapport, puis d'examiner un tout autre rapport comme étant les « vrais » motifs de la décision de la Commission. Un tribunal qui agirait ainsi ne se contenterait pas de « compléter » la décision de la Commission. Il réécrirait la décision.
[33]
Pour ce motif, et étant donné que la troisième section de la décision de la Commission ne comporte aucune analyse pertinente, la seconde décision - visée par une demande de contrôle judiciaire dans le dossier de la Cour no T-316-12 - sera annulée et renvoyée à la Commission pour nouvel examen. J'arrive à cette conclusion malgré qu'environ le tiers des incidents de représailles signalés dans la seconde plainte de Mme Bergeron soient survenus avant le dépôt de la première plainte, car la Commission doit se prononcer sur la question de savoir si la réponse de Mme Miller au second grief a réglé adéquatement le reste des allégations, si bien que la seconde plainte devrait être rejetée aux termes de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la LCDP ou résolue d'une autre manière.
[34]
Par conséquent, je dois accueillir la demande no T-316-12.
La première décision: no T-315-12
[35]
Contrairement à la seconde décision, la section [traduction] « Analyse » citée par la Commission dans la première décision provenait du rapport produit effectivement pour la première plainte. Par conséquent, le principe de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> selon lequel le reste du rapport de l'enquêteuse constitue le raisonnement de la Commission doit s'appliquer, à moins qu'il n'y ait un motif raisonnable d'écarter ce précédent.
[36]
Si la Commission n'avait adopté qu'une faible partie de la section [traduction] « Analyse », à tel point qu'il serait raisonnablement clair qu'elle avait préféré certains des motifs du rapport au détriment de certains autres, la Cour aurait peut-être tiré une conclusion différente. Toutefois, la Commission a adopté la totalité de la section [traduction] « Analyse », et rien ne permet de douter qu'elle voulait, en fait, adopter la totalité du rapport. Par conséquent, il est approprié de tenir compte de la totalité du rapport, et pas seulement de l'extrait expressément adopté par la Commission lors de l'examen de la première décision.
[37]
Ainsi qu'il est signalé précédemment, l'enquêteuse a invité les parties à soumettre des observations sur les facteurs qui aideraient à trancher la question de savoir si la première plainte était « frivole, vexatoire ou entachée de mauvaise foi » du fait que [traduction] « la procédure de règlement des griefs [avait déjà] traité adéquatement les questions soulevées ». Voici à nouveau la liste des facteurs:
a) Quelle était la nature de l'autre mécanisme de recours qui a été utilisé?
b) Y a-t-il eu une audience consacrée aux questions soulevées par la plainte?
c) La plaignante a-t-elle eu la possibilité de présenter sa position?
d) Est-ce que la décideuse était indépendante?
e) Quelle décision a-t-elle rendue?
f) La décision aborde-t-elle toutes les questions relatives aux droits de la personne soulevées dans la plainte?
g) Quelles mesures de redressement étaient demandées dans le grief ou l'autre mécanisme de recours?
h) Si la plaignante a eu gain de cause (en tout ou en partie) dans le cadre cet autre mécanisme de recours, quelles mesures de redressement lui ont été accordées?
[38]
Ces facteurs visent à vérifier si une plainte a, au fond, déjà été tranchée dans le cadre d'un autre mécanisme, si bien que la Commission devrait refuser de la trancher une autre fois. La disposition prévoit qu'il peut y avoir certaines différences entre les questions soulevées, les voies de recours disponibles, la procédure utilisée et ainsi de suite dans les deux mécanismes - autrement, le recours à un autre mécanisme similaire, mais pas identique à celui prévu aux termes de la LCDP ne pourrait empêcher un plaideur de s'adresser à la Commission.
[39]
Il ressort clairement de la jurisprudence qu'il faut accorder à la Commission une grande marge de manœuvre dans l'exercice de son jugement et dans l'appréciation des facteurs pertinents lorsqu'elle doit se prononcer sur l'application de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la LCDP et qu'elle exécute cette « fonction d'examen préalable »: voir, par exemple, l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 38.
[40]
Le rapport sur la première plainte comportait un résumé des faits et des arguments des parties. On peut ainsi résumer ce rapport:
a) l'autre mécanisme de recours était la procédure de règlement des griefs de JC;
b) [traduction] « [i]l n'y a pas eu d'audience sur les questions parce que le grief n'a pas été soumis à l'arbitrage »;
c) la plaignante a eu la possibilité de présenter sa position pleinement dans le cadre de la procédure de règlement des griefs;
d) la plaignante soutient que la décideuse n'était pas indépendante (il n'y a aucune analyse de cette question);
e) Mme Miller a conclu: qu'il n'y avait pas eu de mesure disciplinaire, ni de violation de la LCDP; que les mesures prises par JC étaient nécessaires pour répondre aux besoins opérationnels; qu'il n'était pas possible de poursuivre les discussions indéfiniment (Mme Miller a noté que le ministère avait fait plusieurs tentatives sur une période de plusieurs années, affirmant implicitement que Mme Bergeron n'avait pas été très coopérative dans le cadre du processus relatif aux mesures d'adaptation);
f) [traduction] « [Mme Miller] semble s'être penchée sur les questions [relatives aux droits de la personne] »;
g) les mesures de redressement demandées dans le grief étaient similaires à celles demandées dans la plainte relative aux droits de la personne.
La section [traduction] « Analyse » du rapport est reproduite au paragraphe 25 des présents motifs. L'enquêteuse a conclu que les allégations de Mme Bergeron avaient été [traduction] « traitées » au moyen de la procédure de règlement des griefs.
[41]
Bien que les motifs de la Commission dans la première décision, formulés uniquement dans la lettre envoyée aux parties, sont loin d'être parfaits, le dossier à sa disposition (en particulier le rapport relatif aux articles 40 et 41 produit pour la première plainte) appuie amplement sa conclusion. Dans son premier grief, Mme Bergeron avait soulevé à peu près les mêmes questions qu'elle a soulevées dans la première plainte; elle avait demandé à peu près les mêmes mesures de redressement; elle avait eu la possibilité de présenter sa position (mais ne s'était pas pleinement prévalue de ce droit); elle avait obtenu une décision comportant une conclusion sur ses allégations concernant le refus de prendre des mesures d'adaptation (mais, dans une large mesure à cause des retards de Mme Bergeron elle-même, ces allégations ont été rejetées); elle avait reçu une autre offre de négociation de son retour au travail, ce qui indiquait que le processus relatif aux mesures d'adaptation était toujours en cours et que, par conséquent, le dépôt de sa plainte était prématuré.
[42]
La seule question dans la première plainte de Mme Bergeron qui était vraiment différente et qui n'avait pas été soulevée (ni, par conséquent, réglée) dans la procédure de règlement des griefs était de savoir si la politique (non identifiée) du Conseil du Trésor consistant à [traduction] « maintenir les personnes handicapées sur la liste de priorité pour seulement un an » était discriminatoire. Toutefois, dans ses observations en réponse au rapport relatif aux articles 40 et 41 produit pour la première plainte, Mme Bergeron n'a pas donné suite sérieusement à l'argument selon lequel le rejet de sa plainte entraînerait l'examen de la politique du Conseil du Trésor; de plus, Mme Bergeron n'a pas donné suite à cette question dans le cadre du présent contrôle judiciaire. Ainsi, en plus du fait que la question de savoir si les mêmes questions étaient soulevées dans les deux processus n'est qu'un des facteurs d'une analyse liée à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
), la question se rapportant à la politique du Conseil du Trésor est d'une importance négligeable dans le cadre du présent contrôle judiciaire visant la décision rendue par la Commission.
[43]
De plus, bien que Mme Bergeron ait toujours soutenu que la procédure de règlement des griefs n'était pas indépendante et, par conséquent, ne pouvait pas mener à une résolution adéquate de ses plaintes, rien n'indique que Mme Miller avait un parti pris ou a manqué d'impartialité dans ses décisions sur les griefs; de plus, dans les circonstances, le manque d'indépendance prétendu de la procédure de règlement des griefs ne suffit pas pour conclure que la décision de la Commission était déraisonnable: les lacunes alléguées sont hypothétiques et, encore une fois, n'ont trait qu'à un des facteurs dans la liste signalée ci-dessus. La plupart, sinon la totalité, des autres facteurs militaient en faveur du rejet de la plainte.
[44]
Par conséquent, la décision de la Commission - à savoir que les questions soulevées par Mme Bergeron avaient fait l'objet d'un traitement raisonnable lors de la procédure de règlement des griefs et qu'il n'y avait pas lieu de poursuivre les procédures - appartenait aux issues possibles acceptables, et il n'y a pas lieu d'infirmer cette décision.
[45]
Par conséquent, je dois rejeter la demande no T-315-12.
