Mandamin, J.
: The Minister applies for judicial review of the June 1, 2010 decision of the Member of the Refugee Protection Division of Immigration and Refugee Board (the RPD) rejecting the Minister's application under section 109 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001 c. 27 (
IRPA
) to vacate the Respondent's refugee protection conferred by the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) on November 30, 1994.
[2]
The Minister alleged that the Respondent obtained the positive 1994 refugee determination as a result of misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter, that being his conviction in 1992 of four misdemeanour offences under section 647.6 of the California Penal Code of "annoying or molesting children".
[3]
The RPD found that the Respondent did not obtain his positive refugee determination as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter. In particular, the RPD found that had the same evidence regarding the Respondent's convictions been known to the CRDD in 1994, the Respondent would not have been excluded from refugee status under Article 1F(b) of the
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
, July 28, 1951, [1969] Can. T.S. No. 6 (the
Convention
) for the commission of "serious crimes".
[4]
The Minister raises several issues but his principal submission is that the RPD erred in its analysis of what constitutes a serious crime under Article 1F(b) having regard to the Federal Court of Appeal decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[5]
I have concluded for reasons that follow that the RPD did not err in coming to its decision and I dismiss this application for judicial review.
Facts
[6]
Mr. Jose Vicelio Lopez Velasco (the Respondent) is a citizen of Guatemala. While a youth in 1980, he left Guatemala with his family and lived in Mexico as a refugee. He lost his status for working outside the refugee camp. In 1984 he joined guerrillas in Guatemala and stayed with them for eight months. He returned to Mexico then moved to the United States in 1988.
[7]
In April 1992 Mr. Lopez Velasco, then 25 years old, was charged with four counts of the felony of committing a lewd act upon a child in violation of s. 288(a) of the
California Penal Code
. He pled not guilty. At trial, the District Attorney reduced the charges to the misdemeanour offence of annoying or molesting children under section 647.6 of the
Code
. Mr. Lopez Velasco pleaded nolo contendere. He was given a conditional sentence of 36 months and was required to serve 180 days in prison with 30 days credit for time in custody. The conditions were that he obey all laws, commit no like violation, have no contact with the victims and register as a sex offender.
[8]
He came to Canada in November 1992 and made a refugee claim that he had a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Army of Guatemala by reason of political opinion and membership in a particular social group, arising from the Army's accusations that the claimant and his family were guerrillas. In his Details of Arrival Form he answered "No" to the question of whether he had ever been convicted of any crime or offense in any country. In his Personal Information Form, Mr. Lopez Velasco again indicated that he had never been convicted or charged with a crime in any country.
Procedural History
[9]
Mr. Lopez Velasco's refugee claim was accepted and he was determined to be a Convention refugee on November 30, 1994. The CRDD did not provide written reasons for its decision.
[10]
In his application for permanent residence in Canada made on August 23, 1996, Mr. Lopez Velasco indicated that he had been convicted or charged with a crime in the United States.
[11]
On February 14, 2001, the former Adjudication Division held an inquiry under the old
Immigration Act
, R.S.C., 1985, C. I-2 (
Immigration Act
) to determine whether Mr. Lopez Velasco was inadmissible to Canada due to his criminal conviction in the United States for annoying or molesting children. The Adjudicator found Mr. Lopez Velasco's conviction under section 647.6 of the
California Penal Code
for annoying or molesting children was equivalent to the offence of sexual interference under section 151 of the
Criminal Code
, R.S.C. 1985 c. C-46 (
Criminal Code
). The Adjudicator found there were reasonable grounds to believe Mr. Lopez Velasco had been convicted outside of Canada of an offence, that if committed in Canada that may be punishable under the
Criminal Code
by a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more. The Adjudicator concluded that Mr. Lopez Velasco was inadmissible under section 19(1) (c.1) (i) of the
Immigration Act
and issued a deportation order against him.
[12]
On June 28, 2002, the
Immigration Act
was repealed and the current
Immigration and Refugee
Act
came into force. The transitional provisions of s.338 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (
IRP Regulations
) conferred refugee protection on Mr. Lopez Velasco.
[13]
On March 4, 2009 the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness made an application pursuant to s. 109 of
IRPA
to vacate and nullify Mr. Lopez Velasco's positive refugee determination on the grounds that he obtained his refugee status by directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts that related to a relevant mater - specifically, that he had lied about his criminal record, and had this information been known, Mr. Lopez Velasco would have been excluded under Article 1F(b) of the
Convention
for having committed a serious non-political crime prior to entering Canada.
[14]
The RPD hearing for the application to vacate was held on November 2, 2009. The RPD had before it the whole of the evidence including the exhibits and evidence produced at the original CRDD hearing. There was no written decision with respect to the positive original CRDD refugee determination, but there was a Notice of Decision dated November 30, 1998. The RPD also had evidence that the Minister submitted concerning the 1992 California charges including police reports and court records. Lastly the RPD had the testimony from the Respondent.
[15]
At the hearing, the Respondent denied ever committing these crimes, claiming his landlady fabricated the story because he had asked for return of a deposit that he had given her, and submitted that in any case they were not "serious crimes" for the purposes of section 109. He claimed that he did not answer "yes" to the question of whether he had ever been convicted in another country because he did not understand that he had been convicted.
Decision Under Review
[16]
In its decision dated June 1, 2010, the RPD rejected the Minister's application to vacate and nullify the positive refugee determination made on November 30, 1994, regarding Mr. Lopez Velasco.
[17]
The RPD found that the Respondent had been convicted and sentenced under section 647.6 of the 1992 California Code with "annoying or molesting children". The RPD rejected the Respondent's submission that he answered "no" in his application because he thought he had not been convicted. The RPD noted that misrepresentations or omissions need not have been made deliberately or intentionally, and found that, on a balance of probabilities, the Applicant had understood he had been convicted. The RPD decided that the Respondent's evidence that his criminal record was expunged in December 14, 2009 was not admissible because the RPD must consider whether there would have been a factual foundation for the Minister's claim in 1994.
[18]
The RPD found there were misrepresentations or omissions made to the CRDD and there was serious reason to consider that the Respondent committed non-political crimes outside of Canada. The RPD then turned to the question of whether the crimes were "serious".
[19]
The RPD accepted that it was the Respondent's status or potential exclusion at the time of his application for refugee status (and not at the time of the 2010 vacation hearing) which was to be considered and, for the purpose of analysis of the crimes, reference should be made to the laws of California and Canada as at the times they were committed in 1992.
[20]
The RPD listed the factors that the Federal Court of Appeal stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) should be considered on the question of a serious crime in the context of Article 1F(b), being the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts, and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the convictions.
[21]
In its analysis, the RPD distinguished
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) on the fact that the applicant in that case admitted he was a person described in paragraph 36(1)(b) of
IRPA
(inadmissibility on grounds of serious criminality) and, consequently, there was no consideration of to hybrid offences as discussed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
The RPD observed that the District Attorney in California had chosen to reduce the original felony charges to misdemeanours. The RPD also noted that the equivalent conduct in Canada at the time was a hybrid offence under section 151 of the Canadian
Criminal Code
, which could be prosecuted by way of indictment, with a maximum sentence of 10 years, or by summary conviction, with a maximum sentence of 6 months. Finding that Parliament drew a significant difference between indictable and summary offences as measured by potential penalties, the RPD concluded that a summary conviction under section 151 was not a "serious" crime for the purposes of determining exclusion under Article 1F(b). The RPD wrote:
I conclude that there is a clear direction from Parliament that there is a range of culpability and that some sexually motivated crimes against children are not legally "serious" when making a determination regarding exclusion, even if my personal view might be that all such attacks deserve condemnation. It is for Parliament and not the RPD to distinguish among the range of such crimes, one of the primary distinguishing features being the potential punishment.
[23]
The RPD considered the particulars of the Respondent's offences, including mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The RPD noted the authorities cited, in particular the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, and concluded that the presumption of seriousness was rebutted on the evidence before the panel.
[24]
As a result, the RPD found that the Respondent did not obtain his positive refugee determination as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter. Had the same evidence regarding the Respondent's convictions been known in his original hearing, he would not have been excluded under Article 1F(b) for having committed a serious non-political crime. As such, the RPD dismissed the Minister's application to vacate the Respondent's refugee status.

Issues
[30]
The Minister outlines the following as issues:
Did the RPD err in determining that the Respondent's crime was not serious? Specifically, did the RPD err:
a. In assessing the seriousness of the offence in Canada by
• Misconstruing the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision?
• Distinguishing the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision?
• Failing to consider the intentions of Parliament in determining whether the offence was serious?
b. By failing to consider all of the aggravating circumstances and
c. By ignoring evidence?
Standard of Review
[31]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), the Supreme Court of Canada decided that there were two standards of review, correctness and reasonableness. The standard of review for questions of law is correctness. The standard of review for questions of fact and mixed fact and law is reasonableness: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 50 and 53.
[32]
The Minister submits that the interpretation of Article 1F(b) and IRPA section 98 is a pure question of law to which the standard of correctness applies, while application of the provision to the facts is a mixed question of fact and law attracting the standard of reasonableness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[33]
The Respondent argues that the issues relate to questions of mixed fact and law and therefore should be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness, with deference paid to the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Minister argues that not all of the issues pertain to mixed fact and law.
[34]
I conclude that the standard of review for the interpretation of Article 1F(b) is a pure question of law to which the standard of correctness applies. The standard of review for the determination of the applicable law and facts in the Respondent's case is a question of mixed fact and law, which attracts a standard of reasonableness.
Analysis
[35]
The Federal Court of Appeal has held that one of the purposes of Article 1 F(b) of the
Refugee Convention
is to ensure "that the country of refuge can protect its own people by closing its borders to criminals whom it regards as undesirable because of the seriousness of the ordinary crimes which it suspects such criminals of having committed": <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 28 citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para 48, the Federal Court of Appeal approved of the UNHCR's view that evidence of the commission of certain offences, including child molesting, raises the presumption of a serious crime. The Court set out factors to be considered in determining the seriousness of crime for the purposes of Article 1F(b):
a. evaluation of the elements of the crime,
b. the mode of prosecution,
c. the penalty prescribed,
d. the facts, and
e. the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction.
The Federal Court of Appeal went on to state: "In other words, whatever presumption of seriousness may attach to a crime internationally or under the legislation of the receiving state, that presumption may be rebutted by reference to the above factors": <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 44. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [37]
The Minister submits the RPD misconstrued <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in relying heavily on paragraph 46 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> which stipulated that in countries with hybrid offences, "the choice of prosecution is relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of a crime if there are substantial differences between the penalty prescribed for a summary conviction offence and that provided for an indictable offence." The Minister points out that this passage refers to the mode of prosecution actually chosen in the
foreign
prosecution, whereas the RPD looked at the equivalent Canadian offence of sexual interference, which was a hybrid offence. The California offence was not a hybrid offence; instead the American prosecutors had to choose between two different and separate offences.
[38]
The Minister submits the RPD misinterpreted <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> by combining the misdemeanour offence of which the Respondent was convicted with the felony of which he was originally charged, treating them as if they were one hybrid offence, and then making an analogy to the Canadian section 151 hybrid offence to conclude that the Respondent would have been prosecuted in summarily in Canada.
[39]
The Minister submits that it is not up to the RPD to speculate as to how the case might have been prosecuted in Canada. Under Canadian immigration law, it has long been held that where the equivalent Canadian offence is hybrid, the maximum punishment on indictment is used to determine criminal inadmissibility. The Minister stated that if an offence committed outside of Canada equated to a hybrid offence in Canada, the maximum sentence for the indictable offence is to be used to determine admissibility which, according to section 151 of the Canadian
Criminal Code
in 1992, is ten years:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) (
Kai Lee
),
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) (
Potter)
.
[40]
I note that
Kai Lee
and
Potter
are 1980 decisions concerning immigrant admissibility, while <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a recent 2009 Federal Court of Appeal decision, involves the exclusion of a refugee claimant. In this regard, the latter provides the relevant guidance for the RPD's decision in this case.
[41]
The issue is whether the RPD may consider the hybrid character of the equivalent Canadian section 151 offence of sexual interference as a relevant consideration, where the California charges were reduced from a felony of a "lewd act upon a child" to a misdemeanour of "annoying or molesting children".
[42]
I note that in comparing the California felony and misdemeanour charges to the Canadian section 151 hybrid offence, the RPD was responding to the Minister's submissions on hybrid offences. The RPD makes that clear when quoting the Minister's submission in its decision at para 47:
In the result, the Minister submits that:
... the fact that the offence [in the case before me] is a hybrid offence is irrelevant to the analysis of what constitutes a "serious" crime. As stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and reiterated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; if the crime happens to be a hybrid offence in the foreign jurisdiction, the RPD should look at all the facts underlying the conviction, including any mitigating and aggravating factors. The Minister submits that it is not up to the RPD to engage in an analysis as to how the crime if committed in Canada (and it happens to be a hybrid offence) would be prosecuted in the Canadian courts.
[43]
Having noted the Minister's submission, the RPD then went on to explain why it disagreed with the Minister's proposition that the hybrid nature of the crime was irrelevant, noting at para 48 that to do so would be to ignore a factor among others, which the Court of Appeal stated should be part of the determination. It quoted "[i]n countries where a choice is possible, the choice of t
he mode of prosecution is relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the crime
if there is a substantial difference between the penalty prescribed for the summary offence and that provided for an indictable offence." (underlining is the RPD's)
[44]
The Federal Court of Appeal set out a principled approach to determining whether an offence committed by a refugee claimant committed is a serious crime as addressed in Article 1 F(b) of the
Convention
. This approach required assessment of the specific offence by considering pertinent factors. The offence under consideration in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was trafficking in drugs, which is not a hybrid offence in Canada. Nevertheless, Appeal Justice Letourneau stated at para 46:
I should add for the sake of clarity that Canada, like Great Britain and the United States, has a fair number of hybrid offences, that is to say which, depending on the mitigating or aggravating circumstances surrounding their commission, can be prosecuting either summarily or more severely as an indictable offence. In countries where the choice is possible, the choice of the mode of prosecution is relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of a crime if there is substantial difference between the penalty prescribe for a summary conviction offence and that provided for an indictable offence.
Justice Letourneau also noted at para 43 that while one should have regard to the international standard the perspective of the receiving state cannot be ignored in determining the seriousness of the crime.
[45]
It seems to me that when Justice Letourneau spoke of "the choice of the mode of prosecution" he was referring to the choice made in prosecuting a hybrid offence in a jurisdiction other than Canada. The RPD would appear to have misapplied the quote. However, I find that the RPD did not err in deciding the California prosecutor made an analogous choice in electing to proceed by accepting a plea to a misdemeanour offence rather than proceeding by way of a felony charge. The underlying principle is the same: the California felony and misdemeanour offences together cover an equivalent spectrum of criminal seriousness as does the Canadian section 151 hybrid offence.
[46]
Nor do I consider that the RPD erred in canvassing the range of penalty in section 151 of the
Criminal Code
, given that Justice Letourneau also spoke of keeping in mind the perspective of the receiving state. The RPD was entitled to consider the hybrid nature of section 151 of the
Criminal Code
. In so doing, the RPD focused on the Court's qualification "if there is substantial difference between the penalty prescribed for a summary conviction offence and that provided for an indictable offence."
[47]
The RPD noted the substantial difference in sentencing between the maximum of a six month sentence for a summary conviction and the ten year maximum sentence for an indictable conviction. The RPD found that the six month sentence was nowhere near the ten year sentence noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , which had been found to be an indicator of "seriousness". The RPD concluded that Parliament set out a range of culpability for sexually motivated crimes against children and that some such offences may not be "serious" for the purposes of an exclusion determination.
[48]
In my view the RPD properly limited its examination to assessing the Canadian perspective on the seriousness of offences embodied in section 151 of the
Criminal Code
. I find the RPD did not decide that the Respondent's crime would be prosecuted by way of summary conviction in Canada but rather that section 151 of the
Code
indicated that the relevant Canadian perspective on the seriousness of the offence in question included a range from "serious" (indictable) to "less serious" (summary) offense.
Distinguishing Noha
[49]
The Minister submits that the RPD erred by distinguishing <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> on the basis that the Applicant in that case had admitted that he was inadmissible for serious criminality under s. 36(1). The Minister submits that the outcome of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case did not turn on this admission, as the Court found the applicant inadmissible under Article 1F(b).
[50]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Shore considered the applicant's admission of serious criminality under section 36(1) to be significant before going on to considering <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> factors. This alone could serve as a basis for distinguishing that decision. However the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision also did not discuss the equivalent Canadian hybrid offence. I find the RPD made no error in distinguishing <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in its analysis of Canada's perspective on the seriousness of the offences for which the Respondent was convicted in California.
Intentions of Parliament
[51]
The Minister submitted the RPD erred in failing to consider the intentions of Parliament as expressed in the
IRPA
provisions regarding serious criminality for offences committed outside of Canada. In making this submission, the Minister refers to the Adjudicator's finding of the Respondent's inadmissibility under s.36(1) of
IRPA
. The Minister pointed out that under the criminal admissibility under s.36(1), the maximum length of sentence for the Canadian hybrid equivalent is considered which can be taken to reflect Parliament's intentions.
[52]
The Minister agreed that a finding of an immigrant's inadmissibility for serious criminality under section 36(1) of
IRPA
was not binding on the RPD when deciding a refugee claimant is excluded under Article 1F(b) for having committed a serious non-political crime. Since Parliament did not choose to automatically exclude persons found inadmissible under section 36(1) from refugee protection, it was open for the RPD to proceed as it did with its analysis of serious criminality in accordance with the direction in
Jasayekara
.
Aggravating Circumstances
[53]
The Minister submits that the RPD did not consider all the aggravating circumstances of the Respondent's offences. My review of the RPD's decision shows that the RPD set out the Minister's evidence in detail in its recitation of the evidence at paragraphs 10 and 11, revisited the aggravating factors in analysis at paragraph 40, and validated them in paragraph 57. In addition, the RPD weighed the mitigating factors concerning the Respondent's crimes. The RPD was also alive to the varying factors that could have come into play in the California prosecutor's decision to proceed with misdemeanour charges much as considered in the discussion of Canadian hybrid offences in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 42.
[54]
The RPD is due deference in its decisions concerning facts and mixed fact and law. I find the RPD reasonably considered both the aggravating and mitigating nature of the Respondent's offences in coming to its decision.
Conclusion
[55]
The Federal Court of Appeal's teaching in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is that the interpretation of the exclusion clause in Article 1F(b) of the
Refugee Convention
, as regards the seriousness of a crime, requires an evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts, and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction. A presumption that a crime is serious may be rebutted by the assessment of those factors.
[56]
Further, the Court of Appeal was mindful of hybrid offences in Canada and elsewhere and the relevance of the choice in the mode of prosecution if there was a substantial difference between the penalty prescribed for a summary conviction offence and that for an indictable offence.
[57]
I conclude that, the RPD correctly considered the standards applicable in the United States and Canada concerning the Respondent's non-political crimes. It also considered the particulars of the offences including aggravating and mitigating factors. It followed the direction in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and reasonably decided that the presumption of seriousness was rebutted.
[58]
In result, I find the RPD did not err in coming to its decision. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
[59]
The parties have not posed a question of general importance for certification and I make none.
[60]
I make no order for costs.
JUDGMENT
[61]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
2. I make no order for costs.
Application dismissed.

Le juge Mandamin
[Traduction]: Le ministre demande le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue le 1er juin 2010 par un membre de Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la SPR), par laquelle la demande du ministre, déposée en vertu de l'article 109 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, L.C. 2001 ch. 27 (la LIPR), visant à faire annuler le statut de réfugié du défendeur conféré le 30 novembre 1994 par la Section du statut de réfugié (la SSR), a été rejetée.
[2]
Le ministre soutient que le défendeur a obtenu le statut de réfugié en 1994 à la suite d'une présentation erronée sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou d'une réticence sur ce fait, qui est sa déclaration de culpabilité en 1992 de quatre délits mineurs au sens de l'article 647.6 du code criminel de la Californie (California Penal Code) (le code) en ce qui concerne le [traduction] « harcèlement ou l'atteinte à la pudeur d'une personne mineure ».
[3]
La SPR a conclu que le défendeur n'avait pas obtenu son statut de réfugié à la suite d'une présentation erronée directe ou indirecte sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou d'une réticence directe ou indirecte sur ce fait. En particulier, la SPR a conclu que si la SSR avait été saisie de la même preuve concernant les déclarations de culpabilité du défendeur en 1994, le défendeur n'aurait pas été exclu de la qualité de réfugié en application de l'alinéa 1F
b
) de la
Convention des Nations Unies relative au statut des réfugiés
, 28 juillet 1951, [1969] Can. T.S. no 6 (la Convention) pour la perpétration de « crimes graves ».
[4]
Le ministre soulève plusieurs questions, mais sa principale observation est que la SPR a commis une erreur dans son analyse de ce constituait un crime grave au sens de l'alinéa 1F
b
), eu égard à l'arrêt de la Cour d'appel fédérale
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[5]
Je conclurai pour les motifs suivants que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur en rendant sa décision et je rejetterai la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire.
Les faits
[6]
M. Jose Vicelio Lopez Velasco (le défendeur) est un citoyen guatémalien. Alors qu'il était adolescent en 1980, il a quitté le Guatémala avec sa famille et est allé vivre au Mexique en tant que réfugié. Il a perdu son statut en travaillant en dehors du camp de réfugiés. En 1984, il s'est enrôlé chez les guérillos du Guatémala et est resté avec eux pendant huit mois. Il est ensuite retourné au Mexique avant de déménager aux États-Unis en 1988.
[7]
En avril 1992, M. Lopez Velasco, alors âgé de 25 ans, a fait l'objet de quatre chefs d'accusation pour crime d'acte de nature obscène impliquant un enfant, en infraction de l'alinéa 288
a
) du code criminel de la Californie. Il a plaidé l'innocence. À son procès, le procureur local a réduit les accusations à des délits mineurs de harcèlement ou d'atteinte à la pudeur d'une personne mineure au sens de l'article 647.6 du code. M. Lopez Velasco n'a pas contesté les accusations. Il a reçu une peine d'emprisonnement sous conditions de 36 mois et devait demeurer en prison pendant 180 jours moins les 30 jours purgés en détention. Les conditions étaient qu'il devait obéir à toutes les lois, ne commettre aucune infraction similaire, n'avoir aucun contact avec les victimes et s'enregistrer en tant que délinquant sexuel.
[8]
Il est arrivé au Canada en novembre 1992 et a déposé une demande d'asile fondée sur une crainte de persécution de la part de l'armée du Guatémala pour motifs d'opinion politique et d'appartenance à un groupe social particulier découlant du fait que l'armée guatémalienne avait accusé sa famille et lui de faire partie des guérillos. Dans les renseignements fournis dans son formulaire d'arrivée, il a répondu « non » à la question de savoir s'il avait déjà été déclaré coupable de crime ou d'infraction dans un pays. Dans son formulaire de renseignements personnels, M. Lopez Velasco a encore indiqué qu'il n'avait jamais été déclaré coupable ou accusé d'un crime dans un pays.
L'historique des procédures
[9]
La demande d'asile de M. Lopez Velasco a été accueillie et il a obtenu le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention le 30 novembre 1994. La SSR n'a pas fourni de motif écrit de cette décision.
[10]
Dans sa demande de résidence permanente au Canada, déposée le 23 août 1996, M. Lopez Velasco a indiqué qu'il avait été déclaré coupable ou accusé d'un crime aux États-Unis.
[11]
Le 14 février 2001, l'ancienne Section d'arbitrage a procédé à une enquête en vertu de l'ancienne
Loi sur l'immigration
, L.C. 1985, ch. I-2 (la
Loi sur l'immigration
) afin de déterminer si M. Lopez Velasco était interdit de territoire au Canada à cause de sa déclaration de culpabilité aux États-Unis pour harcèlement ou atteinte à la pudeur d'une personne mineure. L'arbitre a conclu que la déclaration de culpabilité de M. Lopez Velasco en vertu de l'article 647.6 du code criminel de la Californie, qui portait sur le harcèlement ou l'atteinte à la pudeur d'une personne mineure, correspondait à l'infraction de contacts sexuels au sens de l'article 151 du
Code criminel
, L.C. 1985, ch. C-46 (le
Code criminel
). L'arbitre a conclu qu'il y avait suffisamment de motifs pour croire que M. Lopez Velasco avait été condamné d'une infraction à l'extérieur du pays, laquelle aurait été punissable en application du
Code criminel,
si elle avait été commise au Canada, d'un emprisonnement maximal d'au moins dix ans. L'arbitre a conclu que M. Lopez Velasco était interdit de territoire en application de l'alinéa 19(1) (ch.1) (i) de la
Loi sur l'immigration
et a pris une mesure d'expulsion contre lui.
[12]
Le 28 juin 2002, la
Loi sur l'immigration
a été abrogée et la présente
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
est entrée en vigueur. Les dispositions transitoires de l'article 338 du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 (le Règlement IPR) accordaient le statut de réfugié à M. Lopez Velasco.
[13]
Le 4 mars 2009, le ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile a déposé une demande d'annulation du statut de réfugié de M. Lopez Velasco en vertu de l'article 109 de la LIPR parce qu'il avait obtenu son statut de réfugié en faisant une présentation erronée directe ou indirecte sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou en faisant preuve de réticence directe ou indirecte sur ce fait, notamment qu'il a menti concernant son dossier criminel et que si cette information avait été communiquée, M. Lopez Velasco n'aurait pas eu droit à la qualité de réfugié en vertu de l'alinéa 1F
b
) de la Convention, car il aurait perpétré un crime grave de droit commun avant d'entrer au Canada.
[14]
L'audition de la demande d'annulation par la SPR a eu lieu le 2 novembre 2009. La SPR avait été saisie de toute la preuve, y compris des pièces de procédure et des éléments de preuve présentés à la première audience tenue par la SSR. Il n'y avait pas de décision écrite concernant la première décision favorable de la SSR pour le statut de réfugié, mais il y avait un avis de décision daté du 30 novembre 1998. La SPR avait aussi été saisie de la preuve soumise par le ministre ayant trait aux chefs d'accusation, dont les rapports de police et les dossiers juridiques. Finalement, la SPR avait été saisie du témoignage du défendeur.
[15]
À l'audience, le défendeur a nié avoir perpétré ces crimes, déclarant que sa locatrice avait fabriqué l'histoire, car il lui avait demandé de rembourser un dépôt qu'il lui avait donné et que, de toute façon, il ne s'agissait pas de « crimes graves » au sens de l'article 109. Il a prétendu qu'il n'avait pas répondu « oui » à la question de savoir s'il avait déjà été déclaré coupable dans un autre pays, car il n'avait pas compris qu'il avait été déclaré coupable.
La décision soumise au contrôle
[16]
Dans sa décision datée du 1er juin 2010, la SPR a rejeté la demande du ministre visant à faire annuler le statut de réfugié accordé le 30 novembre 1994 à M. Lopez Velasco.
[17]
La SPRa conclu que le défendeur avait été déclaré coupable et condamné en vertu de l'article 647.6 du code criminel de la Californie de 1992 pour [traduction] « harcèlement ou atteinte à la pudeur d'une personne mineure ». La SPR a rejeté l'observation du défendeur selon laquelle il avait répondu « non » dans sa demande, car il croyait qu'il n'avait pas été déclaré coupable. La SPR a noté que de fausses déclarations ou des omissions n'ont pas besoin d'avoir été commises de façon délibérée ou intentionnellement et a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur avait compris qu'il avait été déclaré coupable. La SPR a décidé que la preuve du défendeur que son dossier criminel avait été radié le 14 décembre 2009 n'était pas admissible, puisque la SPR devait considérer s'il y avait un fondement factuel à la demande du ministre en 1994.
[18]
La SPRa conclu que de fausses déclarations ou des omissions avaient été faites à la SSR et qu'il existait de sérieux motifs pour considérer que le défendeur avait commis des crimes de droit commun à l'extérieur du Canada. La SPR s'est alors penchée sur la question de savoir si les crimes étaient « graves ».
[19]
La SPRa accepté que ce soit le statut du défendeur ou sa potentielle interdiction de territoire au moment de sa demande d'asile (et non au moment de l'audience pour l'annulation en 2010) qui devait être considéré et, dans le but d'analyser les crimes, qu'il faille référer aux lois de la Californie et du Canada au moment de leur perpétration en 1992.
[20]
La SPRa dressé une liste des facteurs que la Cour d'appel fédérale a nommés dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) qui doivent être considérés en matière de crimes graves dans le contexte de l'alinéa 1F
b
) soit: les éléments constitutifs du crime, le mode de poursuite, la sanction prévue, les faits et les circonstances atténuantes ou aggravantes sous-jacentes aux déclarations de culpabilité.
[21]
Dans son analyse, la SPR a établi l'inapplicabilité de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) à l'espèce en raison du fait que le demandeur dans cette affaire avait admis qu'il était une personne visée par l'interdiction de territoire pour criminalité à l'alinéa 36(1)
b
) de la LIPR et, que par conséquent, il n'était pas nécessaire de considérer des infractions mixtes, tel qu'il a été étudié dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
La SPRa noté que le procureur local en Californie a choisi de réduire les accusations originales d'actes délictueux graves à celles de délits mineurs. La SPR a aussi noté que le comportement équivalent au Canada au même moment était une infraction mixte au sens de l'article 151 du
Code criminel
, qui pourrait faire l'objet d'une poursuite au moyen d'un acte d'accusation, entrainant une peine d'emprisonnement maximale de dix ans ou au moyen d'une déclaration de culpabilité par procédure sommaire, entrainant une peine d'emprisonnement maximale de six mois. En concluant que le législateur avait tracé une grande différence entre des infractions par voie d'acte d'accusation et par voie de déclaration de culpabilité par procédure sommaire, la SPR a conclu qu'une déclaration de culpabilité par procédure sommaire en application de l'article 151 ne constituait pas un crime « grave » aux fins de détermination de l'interdiction de territoire selon l'alinéa 1F
b
). La SPR a écrit:
Je conclus toutefois que le législateur fournit une directive claire, selon laquelle il existe divers degrés de culpabilité et que certains crimes à caractère sexuel commis contre des enfants ne sont pas « graves » au regard de la loi lorsqu'il s'agit de rendre une décision au sujet de l'exclusion, même si j'estime personnellement que toute agression de cette nature mérite une condamnation. C'est au législateur et au non à la SPR de distinguer les divers crimes de cette nature, dont l'un des principaux attributs distinctifs est la peine potentielle.
[23]
La SPRa considéré les infractions particulières du défendeur, y compris les circonstances atténuantes et aggravantes. La SPR a noté la jurisprudence citée, notamment l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , et a conclu que la présomption de l'aspect grave des crimes avait été réfutée par la preuve dont le tribunal était saisi.
[24]
En conséquence, la SPR a conclu que le défendeur n'avait pas obtenu son statut de réfugié à la suite d'une présentation erronée directe ou indirecte sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou de réticence directe ou indirecte sur ce fait. Si la même preuve concernant les déclarations de culpabilité du défendeur avait été communiquée avant sa première audience, il n'aurait pas été exclu de la qualité de réfugié en application de l'alinéa 1F
b
), puisqu'il n'avait pas commis de crime grave de droit commun. Donc, la SPR a rejeté la demande du ministre visant l'annulation du statut de réfugié du défendeur.

Les questions en litige
[30]
Le ministre soulève les questions suivantes:
Est-ce que la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant que le crime du défendeur n'était pas grave? Spécifiquement, est-ce que la SPR a commis une erreur:
a. dans l'évaluation de la gravité de l'infraction au Canada en
• interprétant mal l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ?
• établissant l'inapplicabilité de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ?
• ne considérant pas l'intention du législateur pour déterminer si l'infraction était grave?
b. en ne considérant pas toutes les circonstances aggravantes?
c. en ignorant la preuve?
La norme de contrôle
[31]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), la Cour suprême du Canada a décidé qu'il y avait deux normes de contrôle: la décision correcte et la décision raisonnable. La norme de contrôle des questions de droit est celle de la décision correcte. La norme de contrôle pour des questions de faits et des questions mixtes de faits et de droit est celle de la décision raisonnable:
Dunsmuir,
aux paragraphes 50 et 53.
[32]
Le ministre allègue que l'interprétation de l'alinéa 1F
b
) et de l'article 98 de la LIPR est une question purement de droit à laquelle s'applique la norme de la décision correcte, tandis que l'application de la disposition traitant des faits est une question mixte de faits et de droit à laquelle s'applique la norme de la décision raisonnable:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[33]
Le défendeur soutient que les questions touchent des questions mixtes de faits et de droit, et que par conséquent, elles devraient être contrôlées en vertu de la norme de la décision raisonnable, en faisant preuve de retenue envers la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Le ministre prétend que ce ne sont pas toutes des questions mixtes de faits et de droit.
[34]
Je conclus que la norme de contrôle pour l'interprétation de l'alinéa 1F
b
) est une question purement de droit à laquelle s'applique la norme de la décision correcte. La norme de contrôle pour déterminer le droit et les faits applicables dans le dossier du défendeur est une question mixte de faits et de droit à laquelle s'applique la norme de la décision raisonnable.
Analyse
[35]
La Courd'appel fédérale a maintenu qu'un des buts de l'alinéa 1F
b
) de la Convention est de s'assurer « que le pays d'accueil puisse protéger sa propre population en fermant ses frontières à des criminels qu'il juge indésirables en raison de la gravité des crimes ordinaires qu'il les soupçonne d'avoir commis »:
Jayasekara,
au paragraphe 28, citant la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'arrêt
Jayasekara,
au paragraphe 48, la Cour d'appel fédérale a cautionné le point de vue du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (UNHCR) selon lequel la preuve de la perpétration de certaines infractions, notamment l'atteinte à la pudeur d'une personne mineure, amène la présomption d'un crime grave. La Cour a établi des facteurs à considérer dans l'examen de la gravité d'une infraction visée par l'alinéa 1F
b
):
a. l'évaluation des éléments constitutifs du crime,
b. le mode de poursuite,
c. la peine prévue,
d. les faits
e. les circonstances atténuantes et aggravantes sous-jacentes à la déclaration de culpabilité.
La Cour d'appel fédérale a ensuite déclaré: « En d'autres termes, peu importe la présomption de gravité, qui peut s'appliquer à un crime en droit international ou selon la loi de l'État d'accueil, cette présomption peut être réfutée par le jeu des facteurs précités »:
Jayasekara,
auparagraphe 44.
L'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [37]
Le ministre allègue que la SPR a mal interprété l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> en se fondant largement sur le paragraphe 46 de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> qui stipule que, dans les pays où se trouvent des infractions mixtes, « le choix du mode de poursuite est utile pour évaluer la gravité du crime s'il existe une différence marquée entre la peine prévue pour une infraction punissable sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité et celle prévue pour un geste punissable sur acte d'accusation ». Le ministre souligne que ce passage fait référence au mode de poursuite réellement choisi par la poursuite
à l'étranger
, tandis que la SPR a étudié l'équivalent canadien de l'infraction avec contact sexuel, qui est une infraction mixte. L'infraction commise en Californie n'était pas une infraction mixte, au contraire les procureurs américains devaient choisir entre deux infractions différentes et distinctes.
[38]
Le ministre prétend que la SPR a mal interprété l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> en joignant l'infraction de délit mineur pour laquelle le défendeur a été condamné à l'infraction d'acte délictueux grave de laquelle il avait originalement été accusé, traitant ainsi les infractions comme une infraction mixte et la comparant par la suite à l'infraction mixte canadienne au sens de l'article 151 pour conclure que le défendeur aurait été déclaré sommairement coupable au Canada.
[39]
Le ministre prétend qu'il ne relève pas de la SPR de spéculer de la façon dont l'affaire aurait été poursuivie au Canada. En vertu du droit canadien en matière d'immigration, depuis longtemps il est maintenu que dans les cas où l'équivalent canadien de l'infraction est mixte, la sanction ou l'acte d'accusation maximal est utilisé pour déterminer l'interdiction de territoire pour criminalité. Le ministre a déclaré que si une infraction perpétrée à l'extérieur du Canada équivalait à une infraction mixte au Canada, la peine maximale pour l'acte criminel devait être utilisée pour évaluer l'admissibilité, ce qui, conformément à l'article 151 du
Code criminel
de 1992, est dix ans:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) (
Kai Lee
)
,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) (
Potter)
.
[40]
Je note que les arrêts
Kai Lee
et
Potter
sont des décisions de 1980 portant sur l'admissibilité de l'immigrant, tandis que l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , une décision récente de la Cour d'appel fédérale de 2009, implique l'interdiction de territoire d'un demandeur d'asile. À cet égard, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> apporte les orientations pertinentes à la décision SPR en l'espèce.
[41]
La question est de savoir si la SPR peut considérer le caractère mixte de l'équivalent canadien prévu à l'article 151, qui porte sur une infraction avec contact sexuel, comme élément de considération pertinent pour évaluer les accusations de la Californie qui ont été réduites d'un acte délictueux grave [traduction] « de nature obscène impliquant un enfant » à un délit mineur de [traduction] « harcèlement ou d'atteinte à la pudeur d'une personne mineure ».
[42]
Je remarque qu'en comparant les accusations californiennes d'acte délictueux grave et de délit mineur à l'infraction mixte canadienne au sens de l'article 151, la SPR répondait à l'observation du ministre concernant les infractions mixtes. La SPR le précise lorsqu'elle cite l'observation du ministre dans sa décision au paragraphe 47:
Par conséquent, le ministre affirme ce qui suit:
[...] le fait que l'infraction [dans l'affaire dont je suis saisi] est une infraction hybride est sans rapport avec l'analyse de ce qui constitue un crime « grave ». Comme il est énoncé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et repris dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , si le crime se trouve être une infraction hybride dans la juridiction étrangère, la SPR devrait examiner l'ensemble des faits sur laquelle repose la déclaration de culpabilité, y compris tout facteur atténuant ou aggravant. Le ministre soutient que ce n'est pas à la SPR d'analyser la façon dont le crime, s'il a été commis au Canada (et il s'agit d'une infraction hybride), ferait l'objet de poursuites devant les tribunaux canadiens.
[43]
Ayant noté l'observation du ministre, la SPR a poursuivi en expliquant pourquoi elle était en désaccord avec l'affirmation du ministre selon laquelle la nature mixte du crime n'est pas pertinente, remarquant au paragraphe 48 que d'agir ainsi consisterait à ignorer un facteur parmi d'autres, ce qui selon l'opinion de la Cour d'appel fédérale, doit faire partie de l'examen. La SPR a cité « [d]ans des pays où cette option existe,
le choix du mode de poursuite est utile pour évaluer la gravité du crime
s'il existe une différence marquée entre la peine prévue pour une infraction punissable sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité et celle prévue pour un geste punissable sur acte d'accusation ». (souligné par la SPR)
[44]
La Courd'appel fédérale a établie une méthode raisonnée afin de déterminer si une infraction perpétrée par un demandeur d'asile est un crime grave visé par l'alinéa 1F
b
) de la Convention. Cette méthode exige l'évaluation de l'infraction spécifique par la considération de facteurs pertinents. L'infraction étudiée dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> était le trafic de stupéfiants, ce qui n'est pas une infraction mixte au Canada. Toutefois, le juge Létourneau a noté au paragraphe 46:
Je tiens par ailleurs à ajouter, par souci de clarté, qu'à l'instar de la Grande-Bretagne et des États-Unis, le Canada dispose d'un nombre assez élevé d'infractions hybrides, c'est-à-dire d'infractions qui, selon les circonstances aggravantes ou atténuantes entourant leur perpétration, peuvent être punissables par procédure sommaire ou, plus sévèrement, sur acte d'accusation. Dans des pays où cette option existe, le choix du mode de poursuite est utile pour évaluer la gravité du crime s'il existe une différence marquée entre la peine prévue pour une infraction punissable sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité et celle prévue pour un geste punissable sur acte d'accusation.
Le juge Létourneau a aussi noté au paragraphe 43 que, même si l'on doit tenir compte de la norme internationale, le point de vue de l'État d'accueil ne peut être ignoré lors de l'évaluation de la gravité du crime.
[45]
Il me semble que lorsque le juge Létourneau parlait du « choix du mode de poursuite », il faisait référence au choix fait dans la poursuite d'une infraction mixte dans une juridiction autre que celle du Canada. La SPR semble avoir mal appliqué la citation. Cependant, je conclus que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que le procureur de la Californie avait fait un choix similaire en préférant accepter une plaidoirie de culpabilité à une infraction de délit mineur plutôt que de procéder avec une accusation d'acte délictueux grave. Le principe sous-jacent est le même: les infractions californiennes d'acte délictueux grave et de délit mineur, lorsque mises ensemble, couvrent le même éventail dans la gravité de crimes que représente l'infraction mixte canadienne au sens de l'article 151.
[46]
De plus, je ne considère pas que la SPR a commis une erreur en examinant de façon approfondie la gamme de sanctions prévues à l'article 151 du
Code criminel
, étant donné que le juge Létourneau a aussi mentionné qu'il fallait garder en tête le point de vue de l'État d'accueil. La SPR était en droit de considérer la nature mixte de l'article 151 du
Code criminel
. En procédant ainsi, la SPR s'est concentrée sur le commentaire de la Cour « s'il existe une différence marquée entre la peine prévue pour une infraction punissable sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité et celle prévue pour un geste punissable sur acte d'accusation ».
[47]
La SPRa constaté une différence notable entre le prononcé d'une peine maximale de six mois de prison découlant d'une déclaration sommaire de culpabilité et celui d'une peine maximale de dix ans de prison d'une condamnation pour acte criminel. La SPR a conclu que la peine de six mois était très loin d'équivaloir la peine de dix ans que la Cour d'appel fédérale a considérée dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , comme étant un indicateur de « gravité ». La SPR a conclu que le législateur avait établi une gamme de culpabilité pour des crimes d'ordre sexuel envers les personnes mineures et que ces infractions peuvent ne pas être « graves » aux fins d'évaluation en matière d'interdiction de territoire.
[48]
Selon moi, la SPR a justement restreint son examen à l'évaluation de la perspective canadienne relative à la gravité des infractions exprimée dans l'article 151 du
Code criminel.
Je constate que la SPR n'a pas conclu que le crime du défendeur ferait l'objet d'une déclaration de culpabilité par procédure sommaire au Canada, mais plutôt que l'article 151 du
Code
criminel
indiquait que la perspective canadienne pertinente à la gravité d'une infraction comprenait une gamme d'infractions variant de « grave » (punissable par voie de mise en accusation) à « moins grave » (punissable par voie de déclaration sommaire de culpabilité).
L'inapplicabilité de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [49]
Le ministre allègue que la SPR a commis une erreur en établissant l'inapplicabilité de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> en se fondant sur le fait que le demandeur dans cette affaire avait admis qu'il était interdit de territoire pour crime grave selon le paragraphe 36(1). Le ministre soutient que l'issue de l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> n'a pas été modifiée par cette admission, puisque la Cour a conclu que le demandeur était interdit de territoire selon l'alinéa 1F
b
).
[50]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Shore a considéré que l'admission de grande criminalité selon le paragraphe 36(1) constituait un facteur significatif avant d'étudier les facteurs tirés de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Considérer uniquement ce fait aurait pu servir à établir l'inapplicabilité de cette décision. Cependant, la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> n'a pas étudié l'équivalent canadien de l'infraction mixte. Je constate que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur en établissant l'inapplicabilité de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à son analyse de la perspective canadienne concernant la gravité des infractions pour lesquelles le défendeur a été déclaré coupable en Californie.
Les intentions du législateur
[51]
Le ministre a allégué que la SPR avait erré en ne considérant pas les intentions du législateur exprimées dans les dispositions de la LIPR concernant les crimes graves perpétrés à l'extérieur du Canada. Pour appuyer cette prétention, le ministre fait référence à la conclusion de l'arbitre voulant que le défendeur soit interdit de territoire en vertu du paragraphe 36(1) de la LIPR. Le ministre a souligné que, selon l'interdiction de territoire pour motif de criminalité au sens du paragraphe 36(1), la durée maximale d'une peine pour l'équivalent mixte au Canada est prise en considération, ce qui peut être interprété comme respectant les intentions du législateur.
[52]
Le ministre a convenu que la conclusion quant à l'interdiction de territoire d'un immigrant pour motif de grande criminalité prévue au paragraphe 36(1) de la LIPR ne liait pas la SPR lorsqu'elle étudiait si un demandeur d'asile était interdit de territoire en vertu de l'alinéa 1F
b
) pour avoir perpétré un crime grave de droit commun. Puisque le législateur n'a pas choisi d'interdire automatiquement les personnes déclarées inadmissibles au statut de réfugié en vertu du paragraphe 36(1), la SPR avait le droit de procéder comme elle l'a fait dans son analyse de crime grave conformément à l'orientation fournie par l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Les circonstances aggravantes
[53]
Le ministre allègue que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de toutes les circonstances aggravantes des infractions perpétrées par le défendeur. Mon contrôle de la décision de la SPR démontre que la SPR a présenté la preuve du ministre en détail dans son résumé de la preuve aux paragraphes 10 et 11, a passé en revue les facteurs aggravants dans son analyse au paragraphe 40 et les a validés au paragraphe 57. De plus, la SPR a examiné les facteurs atténuants des crimes du défendeur. La SPR était aussi consciente des facteurs changeants qui auraient pu entrer en jeu dans la décision du procureur de la Californie de procéder à des accusations de délit mineur comme cela a été fait dans l'analyse des infractions mixtes canadiennes dans l'arrêt
Jayasekara,
au paragraphe 42.
[54]
Il faut faire preuve de retenue à l'égard des décisions de la SPR touchant des questions de faits et des questions mixtes de faits et de droit. Je constate que la SPR a raisonnablement examiné les natures aggravante et atténuante des infractions perpétrées par le défendeur pour arriver à sa décision.
Conclusion
[55]
Ce qu'il faut retirer de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> rendu par la Cour d'appel fédérale, c'est que l'interprétation de la disposition traitant de l'interdiction de territoire au sens de l'alinéa 1F
b
) de la Convention en ce concerne la gravité d'un crime exige une évaluation des éléments constitutifs du crime, du mode de poursuite, de la peine prévue, des faits et des circonstances atténuantes et aggravantes sous-jacentes à la déclaration de culpabilité. La présomption de la gravité d'un crime peut être réfutée par l'examen de ces facteurs.
[56]
De plus, la Cour d'appel était consciente des infractions mixtes au Canada et ailleurs, ainsi que de la pertinence du choix du mode de poursuite s'il existait une différence notable entre la peine prévue pour une déclaration de culpabilité par procédure sommaire et celle pour un acte criminel.
[57]
Je conclus que la SPR a correctement considéré les normes applicables aux États-Unis et au Canada dans son évaluation des crimes de droit commun perpétrés par le défendeur. Elle a aussi pris en considération les natures particulières des infractions, notamment les facteurs aggravants et atténuants. Elle a suivi l'orientation donnée par l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et elle a raisonnablement conclu que la présomption de gravité avait été réfutée.
[58]
En conséquence, je conclus que la SPR n'a pas erré en arrivant à sa décision. La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire sera rejetée.
[59]
Les parties n'ont pas soumis de question de portée générale aux fins de certification et je n'en émettrai aucune.
[60]
Je n'adjugerai aucuns dépens relativement à cette demande.
JUGEMENT
[61]
LA COUR ORDONNE que
:

2. aucuns dépens ne soient adjugés.
Requête rejetée.
