Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
: The Applicant seeks judicial review of the calculation of his parole eligibility dates by the Chief of Sentence Management  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at Kent Institution in Agassiz, British Columbia. According to the Applicant, the CSM committed an error of law by including the community supervision portion of his youth sentence in calculating his day parole, full parole, and statutory release dates [eligibility dates] under the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, SC 1992, c 20 [
CCRA
]. The Applicant asks this Court to order that his eligibility dates be recalculated to exclude the community supervision portion of his youth sentence.
II.
Judicial Procedure
[2]
This is an application for judicial review under section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC 1985, c F-7 of the CSM's decision, dated February 29, 2012.
III.
Background
[3]
The Applicant, Mr. Brent William van Buskirk, was born in 1986 and is a first-time offender serving an aggregate sentence of 17 years, 2 months.
[4]
On August 29, 2004, the Applicant (a few weeks before his 18th birthday) murdered an individual pursuant to a contract killing for profit.
[5]
In December 2004, the Applicant (then aged 18) entered into a conspiracy with a co-conspirator to murder an individual. The conspiracy did not come to fruition.
[6]
In January 2005, the Applicant entered into another conspiracy to kill another individual. This conspiracy did not proceed beyond the planning stage.
[7]
On December 21, 2006, the Applicant received a 24 month custodial sentence for the common-law offence of contempt of court [contempt of court sentence] because he refused to be sworn and to give evidence in the trial of his co-conspirator.
[8]
On November 30, 2007, the Applicant plead guilty to first degree murder and received a sentence under subparagraph 42(2)(
q
)(i) of the
Youth Criminal Justice Act
, SC 2002, c 1 [
YCJA
] of 6 years in custody [custodial
YCJA
sentence] and 4 years of conditional community supervision [non-custodial
YCJA
sentence]. One year and 2 months were deducted from the custodial
YCJA
sentence for time already served.
[9]
On December 10, 2007, the Applicant received concurrent sentences of 8 and 6 years for two counts of conspiracy to commit murder [adult conspiracy sentences] under paragraph 465(1)(
a
) of the
Criminal Code
,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of court sentence and the
YCJA
sentences. The Applicant received a credit of 1 year for pre-sentence custody towards each count of conspiracy to commit murder.
[10]
The Applicant's sentences commenced on December 21, 2006.
[11]
On December 13, 2007, the Correctional Service of Canada [CSC] informed the Applicant that his warrant expiry date was February 20, 2024, his statutory release date was June 1, 2018, his full parole eligibility date was December 19, 2012, and his day parole eligibility date was June 19, 2012.
[12]
In calculating the Applicant's eligibility dates, the CSC had included his non-custodial
YCJA
sentence, bringing his aggregate sentence to 17 years and 2 months.
[13]
On February 27, 2012, the Applicant made submissions to the CSM requesting an affidavit outlining his eligibility dates and asking if the combined sentences were considered one sentence under section 139 of the
CCRA
.
[14]
On February 29, 2012, the CSM confirmed that all of the Applicant's sentences were considered one sentence under section 139 of the
CCRA
and provided the affidavit requested by the Applicant and described in paragraph 11, above.
[15]
On June 13, 2012 and October 23, 2012, the
CCRA
was amended to make express Parliament's intention that non-custodial youth sentences under subparagraph 42(2)(
q
)(i) would be included in calculating an individual's eligibility dates for full parole and day parole, an individual's statutory release date, and an individual's warrant expiry date.
IV.
Decision under Review
[16]
The CSM determined that the Applicant's sentences had been merged under section 139 of the
CCRA
. In merging these sentences, the CSM included his 48-month non-custodial
YCJA
sentence. The CSM consequently calculated his eligibility dates according to an aggregate sentence of 17 years and 2 months.
[17]
According to the CSM's calculations, the Applicant's eligibility date for day parole was June 19, 2012 and for full parole was December 19, 2012, his statutory release date was June 1, 2018, and his warrant expiry date was February 20, 2024.
V.

CCRA
apply to the Applicant to include his non-custodial
YCJA
sentence in determining his eligibility dates?

VII.
Position of the Parties
[23]
In essence, the Applicant submits that his non-custodial
YCJA
sentence should not be included in determining his parole eligibility dates because parole cannot attach to non-custodial sentences.
[24]
The Applicant cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aff'd 2010 FCA 90, [2011] 4 FCR 29, for the proposition that a non-custodial
YCJA
sentence does not fall within the meaning of "sentence" under the
CCRA
for the purposes of calculating parole eligibility dates. According to the Applicant, the facts of
P(J)
parallel those in the present case, with two exceptions: (i) the Applicant was sentenced under subparagraph 42(2)(
q
)(i) of the
YCJA
; and, (ii) he also received consecutive sentences as an adult under the
Code
.
[25]
The Applicant states that his sentence was converted into an adult offence under paragraph 743.5(1) of the
Code
when he was sentenced for a term of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit murder.
[26]
According to the Applicant, the
CCRA
defines "sentence" to mean a sentence of imprisonment and youth sentence imposed under the
YCJA
.
[27]
The Applicant acknowledges that legislative reform to
Safe Streets and Communities Act
[
SSCA
] has expanded the definition of sentence in the
CCRA
to include custodial and community supervision sentences.
[28]
Notwithstanding these amendments, the Applicant argues that interpreting "sentence" to include his non-custodial youth sentence is fundamentally flawed and that parole is a discretionary form of release that allows an offender to serve a portion of his custodial sentence outside the physical confines of a penal institution, it is inconsistent with and cannot attach to a sentence, or portion of a sentence that is non-custodial. The Applicant cites
R v CAM
, [1996] 1 SCR 500 for the proposition that custodial and non-custodial sentences are fundamentally different and
R v Proulx
, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 SCR 61 for the proposition that parole cannot apply to an offender who was under a conditional sentence of imprisonment and not incarcerated. The Applicant, referring to
P(J)
, above, also observes that parole cannot be granted to a young offender who has been conditionally released. Finally, the Applicant refers this Court to
R v K(C)
, 2008 ONCJ 236, which held that "[t]reating a transferred youth exactly like an adult runs into an immediate difficulty in [sic] calculation of the sentence itself" because a conversion can result in a person receiving a sentence of imprisonment in excess of the 6-year period limited by the
YCJA
.
[29]
The Respondent argues that the CSM did not err in calculating the Applicant's parole eligibility, statutory release, and warrant expiry dates. According to the Respondent, the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence should be included in determining his parole eligibility due to recent amendments to the
CCRA
.
[30]
The Respondent submits that Parliament introduced the
SSCA
to extend the meaning of sentence under sections 2 and 99 of the
CCRA
to include non-custodial youth sentences in response to
P(J)
, above.
[31]
In particular, section 196 of the
SSCA
modifies the definition of sentence in section 2 of the
CCRA
to include a youth sentence consisting of a custodial portion and a non-custodial portion. As modified by section 197 of the
SSCA
, paragraph 99(2)(
b
) of the
CCRA
also now provides that the expiration of a sentence refers to the day on which the sentence expires, notwithstanding the non-custodial portion of a youth sentence. Finally, section 76 of the
SSCA
introduces section 119.2 of the
CCRA
, which provides that, for the purposes of section 120 to 120.3 of the
CCRA
, parole eligibility for a youth sentence is determined on the basis of the total of its custodial and non-custodial periods.
[32]
The Respondent states that section 76 of the
SSCA
came into force on June 13, 2012 and sections 196 and 197 of the
SSCA
came into force on October 23, 2012.
[33]
According to the Respondent, the CSM calculated the Applicant's parole eligibility on the basis that (i) his youth sentences were converted into adult sentences under subsection 743.5(1) of the
Code
and that (ii) his youth and adult sentences were merged into one sentence under section 139 of the
CCRA
.
[34]
According to the Respondent's construction, section 743.5 of the
Code
deems a
YCJA
sentence to be a sentence imposed under the
Code
where an individual receives a youth sentence under subparagraph 42(1)(
q
)(i) of the
YCJA
but receives a subsequent sentence as an adult. The Respondent reasons that section 743.5 of the
Code
brings the Applicant's youth sentence within the scope of subsection 139(1) of the
CCRA
. In the interpretation advanced by the Respondent, subsection 139(1) provides that an individual is deemed to have been sentenced to one sentence if he or she is (i) subject to a sentence that has not expired and (ii) receives additional sentences [merged sentence]; the merged sentence begins on the first of those sentences to be served and ends on the expiration of the last of them to be served.
[35]
The Respondent argues that the Applicant's consecutive sentences trigger section 120.1 of the
CCRA
, which outlines how parole is calculated if additional consecutive sentences are imposed. Pursuant to section 120.1 of the CCRA, the Applicant's eligibility for parole is calculated from December 10, 2007, the date of the imposition of his youth sentence of 8 years and 2 months and his adult sentence for conspiracy to commit murder of 7 years. The Respondent claims that the Applicant's parole eligibility is determined on the basis of a sentence of 15 years and 2 months.
[36]
The Respondent argues that the Applicant's eligibility date for full parole is 1/3 of his consecutive sentence of 15 years and 2 months under subsection 120(1) and section 120.1 of the
CCRA
. Under paragraph 119(1)(
c
) of the
CCRA
, the Applicant became eligible for day parole 6 months before he becomes eligible for full parole. The effect of these provisions, the Respondent submits, is that the Applicant's eligibility dates are December 19, 2012 and June 19, 2012 for full parole and day parole, respectively.
[37]
The Respondent states that section 127 of the
CCRA
entitles a person serving a determinate sentence to release after serving a period of custody of not less than 2/3 of their sentence [statutory release date]. Based on a sentence of 17 years and 2 months, the Applicant's statutory release date is June 1, 2018.
[38]
The Respondent further claims that an order in the Applicant's favor will have the effect of reducing his sentence by four years. This, he argues, is inconsistent with section 743.5 of the
Code
and makes
P(J)
, above, distinguishable.
[39]
The Respondent submits that the Applicant's real purpose in bringing this application for judicial review is to reduce his sentence. According to the Respondent, if the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence is not converted under section 743.5 of the
Code
and merged under section 139 of the
CCRA
, it will either disappear or remain as a concurrent portion of a youth sentence under the YCJA. This will reduce his sentence for first-degree murder by four years. The Respondent submits that this is not consistent with the sentencing decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court in
R v van Buskirk
, 2007 BCSC 1925, which expressly made the Applicant's sentence for conspiracy to commit murder consecutive to his sentence for first degree murder. Nor, the Respondent argues, is this interpretation consistent with a plain reading of sections 743.5 of the
Code
and 139 of the
CCRA
, which seek to treat offenders with multiple consecutive offences as adults serving a single sentence under the
Code
.
[40]
P(J)
, above, according to the Respondent, addressed the discrete issue of including non-custodial youth sentences in calculating parole eligibility. By contrast, the Applicant's consecutive adult sentence triggered the application of subsection 743.5(1) of the
Code
. The Respondent reasons that the effect of subsection 743.5(1) is that the
YCJA
no longer applies to the Applicant. Since subsection 743.5(1) deems the Applicant to having been sentenced under the
Code
, the Respondent submits that the
YCJA's
provisions with respect to community supervision, conditional supervision, and continuation of custody no longer apply. According to the Respondent, the Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
, above, did not address the sentence conversion and merger provisions in sections 743.5 of the Code and 139 of the
CCRA
and, as a result, is neither guiding nor binding on this Court.
[41]
The Respondent submits that, should this Court find that the amendments to the
CCRA
in the
SSCA
do not apply to the Applicant because they came into effect after he was sentenced, then it should direct the CSC to administer the sentence in a manner consistent with the terms of the youth sentence under the
YCJA
. In particular, this Court should order the CSC to convert the supervision
YCJA
sentence of 4 years into a similar period of statutory release under the
CCRA
. The Respondent reasons that the statutory release provisions in section 127 of the
CCRA
are analogous to the community supervision provisions in subparagraph 43(2)(
q
)(i) of the
YCJA
. Such an approach would convert the Applicant's first degree murder sentence into a period of four months and two years in prison and a period of statutory release for four years.
[42]
The Respondent submits that this approach respects the intention of Parliament as expressed in sections 743.5 of the
Code
and 139 of the
CCRA
and that it maintains the integrity of the sentence, respects the principles informing youth sentences under the
YCJA
, and avoids the potential problem of subjecting the Applicant to the dual jurisdiction of the Parole Board of Canada (while on parole) and of the provincial director, youth workers, and youth justice court (while serving his non-custodial
YCJA
sentence).
[43]
Finally, the Respondent argues that this application for judicial review is moot or will likely be moot at the date of the hearing of this application for judicial review. According to the Respondent, the Applicant became eligible for day parole under subsection 119(1) of the
CCRA
on June 19, 2012 and will be eligible to apply for day parole on December 19, 2012.
[44]
The Respondent cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the proposition that a decision of a court is moot if it will not have the effect of resolving a controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties. The Respondent states that a decision on this application for judicial review has no practical effect because (i) the Applicant will likely be eligible to apply for full parole by the time it is heard and (ii) it is unlikely that it will have any practical effect on similarly-situated applicants.
[45]
The Respondent distinguishes
P(J)
, above, where this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal adjudicated a moot parole eligibility question on
YCJA
and adult sentencing because the issue would very likely arise in subsequent applications. The Respondent argues that this rationale does not extend to this application for judicial review because amendments to the
CCRA
prevent applications on similar facts from succeeding. In particular, these amendments express Parliament's intention that both custodial and non-custodial portions of sentences under the
YCJA
are included in calculating parole eligibility.
VIII.
Analysis
[46]
In
P(J)
, above, Justice Richard Mosley of this Court held that the interpretation of the parole eligibility provisions is the standard of correctness (at para 10).
[47]
This Court follows Justice Mosley's determination of the applicable standard of review. The correctness standard is even more appropriate because the dispositive question in the application for judicial review is the temporal application of recent amendments to the
CCRA
. A question as to the temporal application of a law is a question of law that is "of central importance to the legal system ... and outside the ... specialized area of expertise" of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  such a question of law attracts the standard of correctness.
[48]
The critical question in this application for judicial review is whether the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence can be included in calculating his parole eligibility dates. A plain reading of paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) of the
Code
suggests that the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence must be included in calculating his parole eligibility under the
CCRA
.
[49]
This Application represents an interesting departure from the facts underlying the Federal Court of Appeal's decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
, above. The applicant  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
was convicted and sentenced as a youth under the
YCJA
for second degree murder and did not receive a consecutive sentence as an adult under the
Code
. Conversely, this Applicant was convicted and sentenced as a youth under the
YCJA
for first degree murder and was subsequently convicted and sentenced consecutively as an adult under the
Code
.
[50]
The facts underlying this Application attract a different matrix of statutory provisions than those underlying
P(J)
. For the purposes of this Application, the most important of these statutory provisions is paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) of the
Code
, which provides that, where subsection 743.5(1) applies, the remainder of a youth sentence and a subsequent term of imprisonment are deemed to constitute one sentence of imprisonment for the purposes of section 139 of the
CCRA
. Subsection 743.5(1) provides that if a young person or an adult is or has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence while subject to a youth sentence imposed under paragraph 42(2)(
q
) of the
YCJA
, the remaining portion of the youth sentence shall be dealt with, for all purposes under this Act or any other Act of Parliament, as if it had been a sentence imposed under the
Code
.
[51]
The dispositive issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
was the definition of "sentence" in section 2 of the
CCRA
and whether that definition could encompass a non-custodial youth sentence. In holding that it could not, the Federal Court of Appeal reasoned that the definition of "sentence" in section 2 of the
CCRA
was limited to custodial sentences:
[55] To begin with, it is important to note that the definition of "sentence" found in subsection 2(1) of the
CCRA
says that it "means a sentence of imprisonment and includes ... a youth sentence imposed under the
Youth Criminal Justice Act
."
...
[63] Consequently, although I found the appellant's argument regarding the unity of the youth sentence under the
YCJA
initially attractive, I do not see any merit in it given the wording of the
CCRA
and the
YCJA
. Even if it is true [that] a sentence imposed under subparagraph 42(2)(q)(ii) of the
YCJA
is a "single sanction", only the custody portion thereof constitutes a "sentence of imprisonment" ...
[52]
The Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
supported its reasoning by reading the definition of "sentence" in section 2 of the
CCRA
in conjunction with subsections 89(1) and (3) of the
YCJA
:
[62] Subsection 89(1) of the
YCJA
provides that a young person, aged 20 or older, must be sent to an adult facility to serve his period of custody. It is therefore my view that that period is the only period to which, pursuant to subsection 89(3) of the
YCJA
, the
CCRA
and the [
Prisons and Reformatories Act
] are directed by Parliament to apply. Thus, it necessarily follows that the parole scheme of the
CCRA
can only be concerned with a young person's period of custody to the exclusion of his period of supervision.
[53]
The critical distinction between this Application and
P(J)
is that subsection 743.5(1) and paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) of the
Code
apply to the Applicant but did not apply to the applicant  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
. The Applicant is subject to the conversion provisions under section 743.5 of the
Code
because he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence while subject to a youth sentence imposed under paragraph 42(2)(
q
) of the
YCJA
. The effect of the subsection 743.5(1) of the
Code
is that his youth sentence under paragraph 42(2)(
q
) of the
YCJA
must be dealt with, for all purposes under the
Code
or any other Act of Parliament (including the
CCRA
), as if it had been a sentence imposed under the
Code
. Since subsection 743.5(1) applies to the Applicant, paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) also applies.
[54]
Neither the Applicant nor the Respondent dispute that section 743.5 applies.
[55]
The effect of paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) of the
Code
is that the rationale underlying the Federal Court of Appeal's decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
cannot apply to this Application. The issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
was that the definition of "sentence" in section 2 of the
CCRA
had been limited to a sentence of imprisonment. By contrast, paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) deems the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence and subsequent terms of imprisonment to constitute one sentence of imprisonment for the purposes of section 139 of the
CCRA
.
[56]
This statutory matrix neutralizes the impact of the definition of "sentence" in section 2 of the unamended
CCRA
that was so critical  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
. By virtue of paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) (which was in force when the Applicant was sentenced), the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence was deemed a single sentence of imprisonment for the purpose of the sentence merger provisions in section 139 of the
CCRA
. Under section 139, his non-custodial
YCJA
sentence merged with his other sentences into a single sentence for the purpose of calculating his parole eligibility dates under sections 119 and 120.1 of the
CCRA
. This single sentence began on the first day of the first of his sentences to be served and ends on the last day of the last of them to be served.
[57]
In sum, this Application engages a provision (paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) of the
Code
) that did not arise on the facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
and therefore could not have influenced the Federal Court of Appeal's determination. In this Application, the conversion provisions in section 743.5(3) of the
Code
merged the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence with his other sentences of imprisonment into a single sentence of imprisonment for the purpose of applying the merger provisions of the
CCRA
. In
R v C(A)
, 2008 ONCJ 613, Justice Paul Robertson of the Ontario Court of Justice came to a similar conclusion in interpreting the conversion provisions of the Code: "[The effect of section 743.5 is that a young offender] has now been sentenced on the adult matters and is therefore presently serving [a] sentence, any youth sentence that I impose will be treated as if it was imposed under the
Criminal Code
as opposed to the
YCJA
and that the sentences will be treated as a single sentence, pursuant to s. 139 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
" (at para 18).
[58]
The undersigned member of this Court observes,
in obiter
, that if paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) had not applied, this Court would have had to consider whether the amendments to the
CCRA
apply to the Applicant. To answer this question, this Court would have been required to assess the temporal application of section 2 "sentence", paragraph 99(2)(
b
), and section 119.2 of the
CCRA
.
[59]
Before proceeding, it is helpful to consider the distinction that Professor Ruth Sullivan draws between legislation of retroactive, retrospective and immediate application. While legislation of retroactive application operates to "change the past legal effect of a
past
situation" and legislation of retrospective application operates to "change the
future
legal effect of a
past
situation", legislation of immediate application operates to "change the
future
legal effect of an
on-going
situation" [Emphasis added] (Professor Ruth Sullivan,
Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes
, 5th ed (Markham: LexisNexis, 2008) at 669).
[60]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  holds that there is a presumption that legislation is not construed to have retrospective effect unless "such a construction is expressly or by necessary implication required by the language of the Act. An amending enactment may provide that it shall be deemed to have come into force on a date prior to its enactment or it may provide that it is to be operative with respect to transactions occurring prior it its enactment. In those instances the statute operates retrospectively". In the present case, section 119.2 of the
CCRA
came into force on June 13, 2012 and the amended definition of "sentence" in section 2 and the amended version of paragraph 99(2)(
b
) came into force on October 23, 2012. The Orders-in-Council giving effect to the
SSCA
did not specify whether the amendments to the
CCRA
would be deemed to come into force before this date (SI/2012-48 (2012) C Gaz II, 1627; SI/2012-40 (2012) C Gaz II, 1410). Consequently, the presumption against retroactivity is not rebutted.
[61]
Even though paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) is determinative of this Application and the Respondent did not specifically address the presumption of retroactivity, this Court finds that it may be worthwhile to consider if the
CCRA
amendments would have been of immediate or retroactive application if the Applicant were not subject to section 743.5.
[62]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Julien Chouinard of the Supreme Court of Canada held that a "distinction must be made between the retroactivity of legislation and its immediate effect" (at p 744). Justice Chouinard reasoned that new legislation cannot apply to immediate effects already produced or that occurred over an extended period of time before that new legislation came into effect because that would give retroactive effect to the new legislation. Nonetheless such new legislation "will apply to
future effects
arising out these legal situations, which
have not yet occurred
at the time it came into effect" (
Quebec (Expropriation Tribunal)
, citing Louis Baudouin,
Les aspects généraux du droit public dans la province de Québec
(Paris: Dalloz, 1965) and that it "applied to all
future effects
of both
pending
and future legal relations" [Emphasis added] (citing Professor Pierre-André Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (Cowansville: Éditions Yvon Blais, 1982, p. 132)).
[63]
Québec (Expropriation Tribunal)
, concerned the application of a statute that came into force in 1973 [1973 statute] to an expropriation that began in 1970 but was discontinued in 1979. The 1973 statute required the Québec government to seek the authorization of an expropriation tribunal before discontinuing an expropriation but the predecessor statute only required the government to file a unilateral discontinuance. Justice Chouinard rejected the Québec government's argument that the 1973 statute did not apply because the appropriation began before its enactment. Even though the underlying legal situation occurred before the 1973 statute came into effect, Justice Chouinard reasoned that its application was immediate rather than retroactive. This was because the underlying situation was of an on-going nature and the effect of the 1973 statute was to change the future legal effect of that on-going situation. Indeed, Justice Chouinard accepted the respondent's argument that the 1973 statute "intended to remove for the future the right to file a unilateral discontinuance previously enjoyed by the appellant.
That section has no effect on the right in so far as it was exercised before [section] 55 came into effect
" [Emphasis added].
[64]
Are the amendments to the
CCRA
of retroactive or immediate application? If section 743.5 of the
Code
had not applied, would these amendments have operated to change the
past legal effect
of the Applicant's past parole eligibility or would they have changed the
future legal effect
of his on-going parole eligibility?
[65]
A plain reading of paragraph 119(1)(
c
) and section 120.1 of the un-amended
CCRA
suggests that the amended
CCRA
would
have operated to change the past legal effect of the Applicant's on-going eligibility for full parole and day parole if section 745.3 of the
Code
had not applied.
[66]
Section 120.1 of the un-amended
CCRA
provides that an offender who receives an additional consecutive sentence
is not eligible
for full parole until the day on which he or she has served, commencing on the day on which that additional sentence was imposed: (i) any remaining period of ineligibility in relation to the sentence the offender was serving when the additional sentence was imposed; and, (ii) the period of ineligibility in relation to the additional sentence. Section 120 of the un-amended
CCRA
provides that an offender
is not eligible
for full parole until the day on which the offender has served a period of ineligibility of the lesser of 1/3 of the sentence and seven years. Under paragraph 119(1)(
c
) of the un-amended
CCRA
, the portion of a sentence that must be served by an offender serving a sentence of two years or more before he or she may be released on day parole is, subject to non-applicable exceptions, the greater of (i) the portion ending six months before the date on which full parole may be granted, and (ii) six months.
[67]
Before the amendments to the
CCRA
came into force on June 13, 2012 and October 23, 2012, the un-amended definition of "sentence" in section 2 of the
CCRA
applied to the Applicant. In
P(J)
, above, Justice Marc Nadon held that, under this definition, the non-custodial portion of a
YCJA
sentence could not be included in determining the Applicant's parole eligibility dates (at para 65 and 67).
[68]
If section 743.5 had not applied to this Application, the past legal effect of the un-amended
CCRA
(as interpreted by Justice Nadon  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
, above, would have been that the Applicant would become eligible to apply for full parole and for day parole before section 119.2 of the
CCRA
came into force on June 13, 2012 and before the amended definition of "sentence" in section 2 and paragraph 99(2)(
b
) of the
CCRA
came into force on October 23, 2012.
[69]
The amendments to the
CCRA
, if section 743.5 had not been engaged, would have changed the past legal effect of the Applicant's ability to apply for full parole and day parole by delaying the date on which he became eligible to apply for full parole to December 19, 2012 and to apply for day parole to June 19, 2012. Since the Applicant would (but for section 743.5) have already been eligible to apply by the time the amendments to the
CCRA
came into force, applying those amendments to his circumstances would have had the effect of changing the past legal effect of this situation. Consequently, applying the amendments in such circumstances would have resulted in an impermissible retroactive application of the law.
[70]
Having disposed of the question of the Applicant's full and day parole eligibility dates by applying paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
), it is not, of course necessary to consider the issue of retroactivity for the purposes of disposing of this Application. The undersigned member of this Court stresses that paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) is dispositive of this Application and that the discussion of the temporality of the amendments to the
CCRA
is
in obiter
.
[71]
Pursuant to paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) of the
Code
and section 139 of the
CCRA
, the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence must also be included in calculating the Applicant's statutory release date. Section 743.5 and section 139 merged the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence with his other sentences into a single sentence of imprisonment for the purpose of calculating his statutory release date under section 127 of the
CCRA
.
[72]
Even if paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) had not been engaged, the amendments to the
CCRA
would have been of immediate rather than retrospective application to the Applicant's statutory release date. Consequently, the amended definition of "sentence" in section 2 of the
CCRA
would have applied to the determination of the Applicant's statutory release date under section 127 of the
CCRA
and the Respondent's concern that the Applicant's real purpose in bringing this Application is to reduce his sentence would have been unwarranted.
[73]
Before the amended definition of sentence in section 2 of the
CRRA
came into force on October 23, 2012 and in the absence of paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
),
P(J)
, above, would have applied to exclude the Applicant's non-custodial
YCJA
sentence from the meaning of sentence and, thus, from the calculation of statutory release date under section 127. Under this framework and pursuant to subsections 127(1) and (3) of the
CCRA
, the Applicant would have been entitled to be released on the day on which he completed 2/3 of his sentence [statutory release date].
[74]
The Applicant, however, did not reach his statutory release date before the amended
CCRA
came into force on October 23, 2012. At that point, the Applicant had the possibility,
but not an actual entitlement to
, a statutory release date determined by excluding his non-custodial
YCJA
sentence. Such an entitlement was subject to the condition precedent that the Applicant had completed 2/3 of his sentence. Until that condition precedent had been satisfied, it cannot be said that the past legal effect of the Applicant's situation is changed by the inclusion of his custodial
YCJA
sentence in calculating his statutory release date. Consequently, section 2 of the amended
CCRA
would have been of immediate application to the Application, if paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) did not already apply to include his non-custodial
YCJA
sentence in calculating his statutory release date. That is to say that it would have changed the future legal effect of his previous sentencing situation.
[75]
This Court adds that, even if a law is of immediate application, it may interfere with a vested right (
Québec (Expropriation Tribunal)
, above, at p 746). The Applicant would not have met the conditions precedent to establish his entitlement to an earlier statutory release date before the amended
CCRA
came into force. It follows that he would have had no vested right to have the previous definition of "sentence", as interpreted by
P(J)
, above, applied in his circumstances.
[76]
This Court has decided to exercise its discretion to hear this Application even though it will not have the effect of resolving a controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties because the Applicant became eligible for day parole under subsection 119(1) of the
CCRA
on June 19, 2012 and for full parole under section 120.1 of the
CCRA
on December 19, 2012.
[77] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, holds that the following factors ought to be considered in exercising the discretion to hear an Application notwithstanding its mootness: (i) the existence of an adversarial relationship; (ii) the concern for judicial economy; and (iii) the court's proper function to adjudicate and not legislate.
[78]
The factor of judicial economy militates highly in favor of hearing this Application. The issues of whether paragraph 743.5(3)(
a
) already applies to include a non-custodial
YCJA
sentence in calculating parole eligibility dates and whether the amendments to the
CCRA
have an immediate or retrospective effect on the calculation of the day and full parole of individuals is very likely to arise in other applications. As Justice John Sopinka stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, "[t]he economics of judicial involvement are weighed against the social cost of continued uncertainty in the law" (at para 37).
IX.
Conclusion
[79]
For all of the above reasons, as this matter is not moot as discussed above, the Applicant's application for judicial review in regard to the calculation of the Applicant's parole eligibility under section 120.1 of the
CCRA
and under paragraph 119(1)(
c
) of the
CCRA
is denied on the basis of paragraph 743.5(3)(a) of the
Code
.
[80]
The question in the Application of the Applicant to this Court is in respect of the calculation of parole eligibility. The derivation of that calculation stems from the recognition that the Applicant's sentence under the
Youth Criminal Justice Act
is to be interpreted as if the sentence had been under the
Criminal Code
.
JUDGMENT
[81]
THIS COURT ORDERS
that review be denied with respect to the calculation of the Applicant's eligibility dates for full parole under section 120.1 of the
CCRA
and for day parole under paragraph 119(1)(
c
) of the
CCRA
.
Application denied.
