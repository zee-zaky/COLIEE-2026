I.
Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
: The Applicants seek a judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
] of a decision of an Immigration Officer, dated January 23, 2013, refusing the Applicants' application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds [H&C application] pursuant to section 25 of the
IRPA
.
II.
Background
[2]
The Applicants, Mr. Luis Osorio Lopez and Ms. Cora Cancino Diaz, are Mexican citizens. They have nine children who live in Canada as Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
[3]
They arrived in Canada on May 16, 2009, and applied for refugee protection in December 2009. This application was rejected on August 12, 2011.
[4]
The Applicants also applied for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment, which was also rejected on March 28, 2012.
[5]
Neither decision was challenged.
[6]
On November 7, 2011 the Applicants submitted an H&C application on the basis that they are elderly and have no one to provide for them in Mexico.
[7]
On January 23, 2013, the Officer refused the Applicants' H&C application.
III.
Decision under Review
[8]
The Officer reviewed the circumstances of the Applicants' H&C application and determined that their personal circumstances could not justify a statutory exemption under section 25 of the
IRPA
. Despite the numerous support letters submitted by the Applicants' children, the Officer found that they had not provided sufficient evidence of unusual and underserved or disproportionate hardship if returned to Mexico.
[9]
Based on the evidence before him, the Officer observed that the Applicants would not, as a result of their advanced age, be victims of discrimination or encounter other difficulties if returned to Mexico.
[10]
Under the heading of "Établissement au Canada", the Officer further noted that the Applicants had provided no evidence that a rupture from their family in Canada would cause excessive difficulties for them. On the contrary, the Officer stated that the Applicants had successfully lived without most of their children for the majority of their lives in Mexico, as their children began immigrating to Canada in 1983. There was no evidence that the Applicants were not able to provide for themselves after the departure of their children from Mexico. They also managed to remain in contact with their children in Canada through regular visits. The Officer concluded that the Applicants had the option to continue visiting Canada on a super visa, which would allow them to remain in Canada for 2 years at a time.
[11]
In addition to the Applicants' establishment, the Officer also considered the best interest of their grandchildren; however, he found that there was insufficient evidence provided as to the relationship between them. Moreover, the Officer doubted that the removal of the Applicants would jeopardize the well-being of their grandchildren in any significant way, as the grandchildren were now teenagers and adults and benefited from an already large family network in Canada.
[12]
Finally, the Officer assessed the Applicants' submissions regarding their health. The Officer found that there was no evidence on file to corroborate that the Applicants were in poor health. The Officer also noted that there was no evidence on file that the Applicants would not be able to access medical services in Mexico or that they would be unable to continue any ongoing medical treatments if returned to Mexico.
[13]
Based on the above, the Officer determined that the Applicants did not meet the requirements of the
IRPA
to apply for permanent residence from within Canada.
IV.
Issue
[14]
Did the Officer err in assessing the hardship the Applicants would face if returned to Mexico?
V.
Relevant Legislative Provisions
[15]
The following legislative provision of the
IRPA
is relevant:
25.
(1) Subject to subsection (1.2), the Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who applies for permanent resident status and who is inadmissible - other than under section 34, 35 or 37 - or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada - other than a foreign national who is inadmissible under section 34, 35 or 37 - who applies for a permanent resident visa, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.
25.
(1) Sous réserve du paragraphe (1.2), le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui demande le statut de résident permanent et qui soit est interdit de territoire - sauf si c'est en raison d'un cas visé aux articles 34, 35 ou 37 -, soit ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada - sauf s'il est interdit de territoire au titre des articles 34, 35 ou 37 - qui demande un visa de résident permanent, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.
VI.
Position of the Parties
[16]
The Applicants argue that the Officer ignored the evidence they provided. They submit that the evidence on the record clearly demonstrates that they are afraid to return to Mexico because none of their children live there; and, therefore, no one is able to provide for them.
[17]
The Applicants stipulate that this factor, when taking into account their age and fragile health, establishes that their return to Mexico would have an unreasonable impact on them, and that these circumstances are beyond their control.
[18]
The Applicants allege that the Officer misunderstood the basis of their fear of returning to Mexico. They explain that it is not the absence of medical assistance that they fear if returned to Mexico, but rather the absence of family members to provide for them.
[19]
The Applicants submit that the Officer failed to consider their financial dependence on their children and whether support is available in Mexico for them. They claim that the Officer also failed to consider that they are de facto family members within the meaning of section 12.6 of Inland Processing 5 Guidelines [Guidelines].
[20]
The Applicants do not contest the Officer's findings with regard to the best interest of their grandchildren.
[21]
The Respondent submits that the Applicants did not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate their allegations; and, thus, failed to meet the burden to prove they would suffer unusual and underserved or disproportionate hardship. The onus rested entirely upon the Applicants.
[22]
The Respondent asserts that the Applicants did not provide any evidence that demonstrates that they would encounter any unusual difficulties or be subject to discrimination in Mexico due to their age.
[23]
The Respondent also specifies that no medical documentation was submitted to corroborate that the Applicants are presently ill, in need of treatment or that medical services would not be available for them in Mexico.
[24]
The Respondent further submits that the Applicants did not provide evidence that they were financially dependent on their children in Canada, and notes that the male Applicant has a brother and daughter who may still reside in Mexico.
[25]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Respondent contends that this general lack of evidence made it impossible for the Officer to conduct the analysis that the Applicants are now seeking, and that they must bear the consequences of failing to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim.
[26]
In reply to the Respondent's memorandum, the Applicants state that it is incorrect for the Respondent to claim that they still have family members in Mexico, as the Officer's reasons only refer to those family members as "living outside Canada", without reference to where they live.
[27]
The Applicants also reiterate that the Officer did not consider their dependency on their children in Canada in accordance with the Guidelines.
VII.
Standard of Review
[28]
The standard of review applicable to a decision relating to an H&C application is that of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
A heavy burden rests on an applicant to satisfy the Court that a decision under section 25 requires its intervention (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 173).
VIII.
Analysis
[30]
The jurisprudence on H&C applications is clear: section 25 of the
IRPA
is an exceptional provision. It is an exemption that is granted only in circumstances where an applicant can prove that he/she would face "unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship" if required to file an application for permanent residence from the country of origin. It is the applicant who has the burden of providing clear and convincing evidence of such hardship.
[31]
As the onus of establishing that H&C grounds exist rests with an applicant, courts must refrain from reweighing the different grounds relied upon. As stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[10] ... the weighing of relevant factors is not the function of a court reviewing the exercise of ministerial discretion. Therefore, as long as the totality of the evidence was properly examined, the question of weight remains entirely within the expertise of the immigration officer. ...
[32]
In the present case, the Court finds that the totality of the evidence was examined in good faith but not reasonably. The Officer did not fully consider the relevant factors set out in the Guidelines and arrived at a conclusion which is not supported by the evidence on the record. The Officer was to consider the Applicants' establishment in Canada, their financial dependence on their family, the best interest of their grandchildren, the country conditions of their country of origin and the resulting degree of hardship they would face if returned.
[33]
With regard to their establishment in Canada, the Applicants did not provide any evidence to the Officer that they were dependent on their family in the past or that they had not provided for themselves when they were in Mexico; the evidence on record simply suggests that they would "
not be a burden on the government as they can support themselves
" [Translated] (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] at p 83); that is speaking for the past; however, the growing age factor of the aging Applicants with the passage of years suggests that their situation appears to have indeed changed and where they would not have been dependent in the past, the situation of dependence has in fact changed in the present. It would therefore appear to stem from the file that the Applicants are now individuals differently situated from whom they had been in the past in that they had not been a burden on their society in their country of origin previously, yet they would not appear to be able to look after their needs at the present time. The support letters provided by the Applicants' family clearly indicate that they are
willing
to support the Applicants if they are accepted as permanent residents in Canada; that, again, appears to demonstrate clearly from the evidence in the file that the Applicants are living with their children and grandchildren in the same household in Canada, whereas if in Mexico it would mean subsidizing one more household for the children of the Applicants which it is suggested is much less or not at all feasible from statements made by the Applicants' children.
[34]
The Applicants, with the passage of time and advancing years, did provide supporting evidence to demonstrate that their advanced age in their twilight years and declining health would cause an unusual or disproportionate hardship on them if returned to Mexico. The evidence submitted by the Applicants in this regard is the support letters from the Applicants' children which speak of the Applicants' advanced age and the fact that they are at a time in their lives where dependence becomes more the norm; that is in addition to the attachment to the family members, recognizing that all nine of their children as well as their grandchildren reside in Canada. Therefore, the Officer's assertion and insinuation that if the Applicants have managed since 1983, why would they not be able to do so now? Well, thirty years have passed since then and the passage of time takes its toll wherein they no longer appear to be able to manage and subsist on their own, whereas when younger that was not the case. The notorious passage of time which does not need evidence to substantiate appears to have taken its toll where they were able to travel there and back previously, that appears to be an option that has declined after their last arrival to be reunited with their family in Canada.
[35]
It was unreasonable, having regard for the evidence as a whole, for the Officer to determine that the separation of the Applicants from their family would not cause unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. At this stage in the life of the Applicants, it would appear to cause unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship to the Applicants; whereas, it would not appear to create an undue burden either of a financial nature or create an excess of such on health services in Canada further to the affirmations (and sponsorship application) of their family in Canada.
[36]
The Court recognizes that the Applicants have lived with their children in Canada for a number of years now; although they had spent decades living in Mexico without their children since 1983. There are clear arguments and evidence on the record that demonstrate that the degree of hardship faced by the Applicants would be greater than what they have habitually faced since their children immigrated to Canada.
[37]
The Court finds that the Officer's reasoning, when read together with his conclusions, falls outside of a range of possible outcomes, when read together with Guidelines 12.5, 12.6, and 12.8 to which consideration should be given when grandparents, in the circumstances of the Applicants, live with their children and grandchildren. If humanitarian and compassionate considerations are not applied in circumstances described in the file, then the very reasons for the legislation and policy behind them would not appear to be given their proper due. This case is a case onto itself, "un cas d'espèce", based on its own facts which must be read in complete context rather than dissected piecemeal, and, thereby made devoid of its whole, wherein it becomes devoid of its overall substance and meaning of the very narrative from which it flows.
IX.
Conclusion
[38]
For all of the above reasons, the Applicants' application for judicial review is granted.
JUDGMENT
[39]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
the Applicants' application for judicial review be granted; and, thus, it be referred to another immigration officer to be decided anew. No question of general importance is given for certification.

Luis Osorio  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Shore
[Traduction]: Les demandeurs sollicitent en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (LIPR), le contrôle judiciaire de la décision en date du 23 janvier 2013, par laquelle un agent d'immigration (l'agent) a rejeté leur demande de résidence permanente fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire suivant l'article 25 de la LIPR.
II.
Le contexte
[2]
Les demandeurs, M. Luis Osorio Lopez et Mme Cora Cancino Diaz, sont citoyens mexicains. Ils ont neuf enfants qui vivent au Canada en tant que citoyens canadiens ou en tant que résidents permanents.
[3]
Ils sont arrivés au Canada le 16 mai 2009 et ont présenté une demande d'asile en décembre 2009. La demande d'asile a été rejetée le 12 août 2011.
[4]
Les demandeurs ont également présenté une demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi, qui a été aussi rejetée, le 28 mars 2012.
[5]
Aucune de ces décisions n'a été contestée.
[6]
Le 7 novembre 2011, les demandeurs ont présenté une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire au motif qu'ils sont âgés et qu'ils n'ont personne au Mexique qui peut subvenir à leurs besoins.
[7]
Le 23 janvier 2013, l'agent a rejeté la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire présentée par les demandeurs.
III.
La décision visée par le contrôle judiciaire
[8]
L'agent a examiné les circonstances entourant la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire et a déterminé que la situation personnelle des demandeurs ne pouvait justifier une dispense en vertu de l'article 25 de la LIPR. Malgré les nombreuses lettres d'appui présentées par les enfants des demandeurs, l'agent a conclu que ceux-ci n'avaient pas fourni une preuve suffisante des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou démesurées auxquelles ils seraient confrontés s'ils retournaient au Mexique.
[9]
Compte tenu de la preuve dont il disposait, l'agent a fait remarquer que les demandeurs ne seraient pas, en raison de leur âge avancé, victimes de discrimination ni ne seraient confrontés à d'autres difficultés s'ils retournaient au Mexique.
[10]
Sous la rubrique « Établissement au Canada », l'agent a ajouté que les demandeurs n'ont fourni aucune preuve que la séparation de leur famille au Canada entraînerait des difficultés excessives. Bien au contraire, l'agent a constaté que les demandeurs avaient réussi à vivre en l'absence de la plupart de leurs enfants pendant la plus grande partie de leur vie au Mexique, vu que leurs enfants ont commencé à immigrer au Canada en 1983. Rien ne montrait que les demandeurs n'étaient pas en mesure de subvenir à leurs propres besoins après le départ de leurs enfants du Mexique. Les demandeurs ont réussi à rester en contact avec leurs enfants au Canada grâce à des visites régulières. L'agent a conclu que les demandeurs avaient le choix de continuer de séjourner au Canada en vertu d'un super visa, qui leur permettrait de rester au Canada pendant 2 ans.
[11]
En plus de l'établissement des demandeurs, l'agent a également tenu compte de l'intérêt supérieur de leurs petits-enfants, mais il a conclu à l'insuffisance des éléments de preuve fournis à l'égard des liens qu'ils entretenaient. En outre, l'agent doutait que le renvoi des demandeurs porterait substantiellement atteinte au bien-être de leurs petits-enfants, vu que ceux-ci étaient des adolescents et des adultes et qu'ils bénéficiaient déjà de nombreuses attaches familiales au Canada.
[12]
Enfin, l'agent a examiné les observations des demandeurs quant à leur état de santé. L'agent a conclu qu'il n'y avait au dossier aucun élément de preuve établissant que les demandeurs avaient des problèmes de santé. L'agent a ajouté qu'il n'y avait pas non plus d'élément de preuve démontrant que les demandeurs seraient dans l'impossibilité d'obtenir des services médicaux au Mexique ou de poursuivre un traitement médical en cours s'ils retournaient au Mexique.
[13]
Compte tenu de ce qui précède, l'agent a déterminé que les demandeurs ne répondaient pas aux exigences de la LIPR pour pouvoir présenter une demande de résidence permanente depuis le Canada.
IV.
La question en litige
[14]
L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur lorsqu'il a examiné les difficultés auxquelles les demandeurs seraient confrontés s'ils retournaient au Mexique?
V.
Les dispositions législatives pertinentes
[15]
La disposition législative pertinente de la LIPR est la suivante:
25.
(1) Sous réserve du paragraphe (1.2), le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui demande le statut de résident permanent et qui soit est interdit de territoire - sauf si c'est en raison d'un cas visé aux articles 34, 35 ou 37 -, soit ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada - sauf s'il est interdit de territoire au titre des articles 34, 35 ou 37 - qui demande un visa de résident permanent, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.
25.
(1) Subject to subsection (1.2), the Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who applies for permanent resident status and who is inadmissible - other than under section 34, 35 or 37 - or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada - other than a foreign national who is inadmissible under section 34, 35 or 37 - who applies for a permanent resident visa, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.
VI.
La position des parties
[16]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte des éléments de preuve qu'ils avaient fournis. Ils disent que la preuve au dossier montre clairement qu'ils craignent de retourner au Mexique parce qu'aucun de leurs enfants ne vit là-bas et qu'il n'y a donc personne qui peut subvenir à leurs besoins.
[17]
Selon les demandeurs, lorsqu'on tient compte de leur âge et de leur état de santé fragile, ce facteur établit à lui seul que leur retour au Mexique aurait un impact déraisonnable sur eux et que ces circonstances sont indépendantes de leur volonté.
[18]
Les demandeurs font valoir que l'agent avait mal compris le fondement de leur crainte de retourner au Mexique. Ils expliquent que ce n'est pas l'absence des soins médicaux qu'ils craignent s'ils retournent au Mexique, mais l'absence des membres de la famille qui peuvent subvenir à leurs besoins.
[19]
Selon les demandeurs, l'agent n'a pas tenu compte de leur dépendance financière de leurs enfants et ne s'est pas demandé s'ils pouvaient bénéficier d'un soutien au Mexique. Ils affirment que l'agent a également omis de prendre en considération que les demandeurs sont des membres de la famille de fait au sens de la section 12.6 du Guide sur le traitement des demandes au Canada (IP 5) (le guide opérationnel).
[20]
Les demandeurs ne contestent pas les conclusions de l'agent quant à l'intérêt supérieur de leurs petits-enfants.
[21]
Le défendeur fait valoir que les demandeurs n'ont pas fourni une preuve suffisante à l'appui de leurs allégations et qu'ils n'ont pas réussi, de ce fait, à s'acquitter du fardeau de prouver qu'ils seraient confrontés à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou démesurées. Le fardeau de la preuve reposait entièrement sur les demandeurs.
[22]
Le défendeur affirme que les demandeurs n'ont produit aucun élément de preuve démontrant qu'ils seraient confrontés à des difficultés inhabituelles ou qu'ils seraient victimes de discrimination au Mexique en raison de leur âge.
[23]
Le défendeur précise en outre que les demandeurs n'ont présenté aucun document médical pour confirmer qu'ils sont actuellement malades, qu'ils ont besoin de suivre un traitement ou qu'ils ne seraient pas en mesure d'obtenir des services médicaux au Mexique.
[24]
Le défendeur ajoute que les demandeurs n'ont pas présenté de preuve quant à leur dépendance financière de leurs enfants qui se trouvent au Canada, et il note que le demandeur a un frère et une fille qui habiteraient toujours au Mexique.
[25]
Citant la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le défendeur soutient que cette insuffisance de la preuve a empêché l'agent de procéder à l'analyse que les demandeurs sollicitent maintenant, et que ceux-ci doivent assumer les conséquences de leur omission de fournir une preuve suffisante à l'appui de leur demande.
[26]
En réponse au mémoire du défendeur, les demandeurs soutiennent que celui-ci a tort d'affirmer qu'ils ont encore de la famille au Mexique, vu que l'agent mentionne dans ses motifs que les membres de la famille en question [traduction] « vivent à l'extérieur du Canada », sans indiquer le lieu où ils vivent.
[27]
Les demandeurs rappellent également que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte de leur dépendance envers leurs enfants qui vivent au Canada, conformément au guide opérationnel.
VII.
La norme de contrôle
[28]
La norme de contrôle applicable à une décision relative à une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire est celle de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au par. 15).
[29]
Le demandeur doit s'acquitter d'un lourd fardeau pour convaincre la Cour qu'une décision en vertu de l'article 25 nécessite l'intervention de cette dernière (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 173).
VIII.
Analyse
[30]
La jurisprudence relative aux demandes fondées sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire établit clairement que l'article 25 de la LIPR est une disposition exceptionnelle. Elle permet d'accorder une dispense seulement lorsque le demandeur peut prouver qu'il subirait « des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou démesurées » s'il devait présenter sa demande de résidence permanente dans le pays d'origine. Il incombe au demandeur de présenter une preuve claire et convaincante de telles difficultés.
[31]
Comme il incombe au demandeur d'établir l'existence des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, les tribunaux doivent se garder de réexaminer les motifs invoqués. La Cour a d'ailleurs déclaré ce qui suit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[10] [...] la pondération des facteurs pertinents ne ressortit pas au tribunal appelé à contrôler l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire ministériel. Par conséquent, la question de la pondération relève exclusivement de l'agent d'immigration si celui-ci a examiné correctement tous les éléments de preuve dont il disposait.
[32]
En l'espèce, la Cour estime que l'agent a examiné de bonne foi l'ensemble de la preuve, mais pas de manière raisonnable. L'agent n'a pas tenu compte de tous les facteurs pertinents énoncés dans le guide opérationnel et a tiré une conclusion qui n'est pas étayée par la preuve au dossier. Il devait examiner l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada, la dépendance financière de leur famille, les intérêts supérieurs de leurs petits-enfants, les conditions existantes dans leur pays d'origine et l'importance des difficultés auxquelles ils seraient confrontés s'ils y retournaient.
[33]
En ce qui concerne leur établissement au Canada, les demandeurs n'ont fourni à l'agent aucun élément de preuve quant à la dépendance de leur famille dans le passé ou quant à l'impossibilité de subvenir à leurs besoins lorsqu'ils vivaient au Mexique. La preuve au dossier indique seulement que les demandeurs [traduction] «
ne constitueraient pas un fardeau pour le gouvernement puisqu'ils peuvent subvenir à leurs besoins
» (Dossier certifié du tribunal [DCT], à la p. 83), ce qui est valable dans le passé. Or, le facteur relatif à l'âge avancé des demandeurs indique que leur situation semble avoir effectivement changé; s'ils n'étaient pas dépendants de leur famille dans le passé, ce n'est plus le cas à présent. En conséquence, il semble ressortir du dossier que la situation des demandeurs est tout à fait différente à présent, dans la mesure où, s'ils ne constituaient pas, dans le passé, un fardeau pour la société dans leur pays d'origine, à présent, ils ne semblent pas être en mesure de subvenir à leurs besoins. Dans les lettres d'appui présentées, les membres de leur famille indiquent clairement leur
intention
de subvenir aux besoins des demandeurs si ceux-ci obtiennent le statut de résidents permanents au Canada; là encore, la preuve au dossier démontre manifestement que les demandeurs vivent au Canada avec leurs enfants et leurs petits-enfants sous le même toit, alors que s'ils vivaient au Mexique, leurs enfants devraient financer les dépenses liées à une résidence, ce qui est presque impossible, selon les déclarations de ces derniers.
[34]
Compte tenu de leur âge avancé, les demandeurs ont apporté la preuve que leur vieillissement et leur état de santé précaire leur causeraient des difficultés inhabituelles ou démesurées s'ils retournaient au Mexique. Il s'agit des lettres d'appui présentées par les enfants des demandeurs qui font état de leur âge avancé et du fait qu'à ce stade, leur dépendance devient la règle; vient s'ajouter à l'attachement des membres de la famille le fait que neuf de leurs enfants ainsi que leurs petits-enfants habitent au Canada. Qu'advient-il alors de l'affirmation de l'agent selon laquelle, si les demandeurs étaient parvenus à se débrouiller depuis 1983, pourquoi ne l'auraient-il pas fait à présent? Eh bien, il s'est écoulé trente ans, et le temps a fait sentir ses effets; les demandeurs ne semblent plus être en mesure de subvenir à leurs besoins, ce qui n'était pas le cas dans le passé. Le passage irréfutable du temps a fait sentir ses effets; alors qu'ils pouvaient voyager auparavant, les demandeurs se sont vu refuser cette possibilité après avoir rejoint leur famille au Canada lors de leur dernière visite.
[35]
Compte tenu de l'ensemble de la preuve, il était déraisonnable pour l'agent de déterminer que les demandeurs ne seraient pas confrontés à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou démesurées à la suite de la séparation de leur famille. À ce stade de leur vie, il semble que les demandeurs seraient confrontés à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou démesurées, mais ils ne constitueraient pas un fardeau excessif de nature financière ou autre pour les services de santé au Canada, selon les déclarations (et la demande de parrainage) de leur famille.
[36]
La Cour admet que les demandeurs vivent avec leurs enfants au Canada depuis plusieurs années, même s'ils ont passé au Mexique des dizaines d'années sans leurs enfants depuis 1983. Il ressort clairement des arguments et du dossier que les difficultés auxquelles seraient confrontés les demandeurs seraient beaucoup plus importantes que celles qu'ils avaient connues depuis que leurs enfants avaient immigré au Canada.
[37]
La Cour estime que, lorsqu'il est interprété conjointement avec ses conclusions, le raisonnement de l'agent n'appartient pas aux issues possibles, à la lumière des sections 12.5, 12.6, et 12.8 du guide opérationnel, dont il faut tenir compte lorsqu'il s'agit de grands-parents se trouvant dans la situation des demandeurs, qui vivent avec leurs enfants et leurs petits-enfants. Le fait de ne pas appliquer les motifs d'ordre humanitaire dans les circonstances décrites dans le dossier, mettrait en échec l'objectif même des dispositions législatives et des politiques sous-jacentes. La présente affaire est « un cas d'espèce » qu'il faut interpréter eu égard à l'ensemble du contexte plutôt qu'à la lumière des faits décortiqués et risquer ainsi de la dénuer de tout fondement.
IX.
Conclusion
[38]
Pour les motifs qui précèdent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire des demandeurs est accueillie.
JUGEMENT
[39]
LA COUR ORDONNE que
la demande de contrôle présentée par les demandeurs soit accueillie et que l'affaire soit donc renvoyée à un autre agent d'immigration pour nouvel examen. Aucune question de portée générale n'est proposée aux fins de certification.
