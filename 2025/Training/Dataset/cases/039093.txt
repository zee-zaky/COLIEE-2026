Harrington, J.
: This action for impeachment of a patent of invention and the counterclaim for its infringement deal with the compound known as Escitalopram or (+)-Citalopram. It belongs to a class of compounds known as SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or 5-HT reuptake inhibitors). It has proved useful in the treatment of clinical depression. It is branded in Canada as Cipralex, in the United States as Lexapro and in the United Kingdom as Cipramil. It was invented in Denmark in 1988, and has been patented in Canada, and in many other countries. The patent claims (+)-Citalopram itself, as well as methods to make it and non-toxic salts thereof.
[2]
Apotex Inc. has wanted to market its generic version of (+)-Citalopram for some time. It was first thwarted by Lundbeck who obtained a Court order pursuant to the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
[PM (NOC) Regulations] the effect of which was to prohibit the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance. That Notice would have permitted Apotex market entry. However, the order did not purport to determine whether or not the patent was valid.
[3]
In this action Apotex seeks a declaration that Canadian patent 1,339,452 ('452) is, and has always been, invalid. Lundbeck, for its part, has counterclaimed that Apotex and a related corporation, Apotex Pharmachem Inc., have infringed the patent. It seeks, among other things, an accounting of profits. Apotex admits that if the patent is valid, in whole or in part, it has infringed. Apotex Pharmachem Inc. produced (+)-Citalopram through a method not covered by the patent. Thus, it has infringed only if Lundbeck's claim for the compound (+)-Citalopram itself is valid.
[4]
An invention must be something new. Apotex alleges that (+)-Citalopram is not new so that Lundbeck invented nothing at all. It says (+)-Citalopram was anticipated in the prior literature and, as well, was obvious to those to whom the patent is addressed.
[5]
In order to be patentable, an invention must also be useful. In a later patent application, Lundbeck stated that the Pamoic Addition Salt of (+)-Citalopram was toxic. Since that salt figures in the claims for (+)-Citalopram itself the patent is alleged to be invalid for inutility.
[6]
The subject matter must also be patentable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2002] SCJ No 77 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2004] SCJ No 29 (QL)). However, this is not in issue in the present case.
[7]
A patent represents a bargain between the inventor and the state. In consideration of the grant of a monopoly, the inventor must fully and properly disclose the invention so that when the monopoly expires, others may reproduce the product or process involved without undue difficulty. The
Patent Act
requires the applicant to provide a specification which discloses what has been invented and how to replicate it. The specification ends with a claim or series of claims over which a monopoly is asserted. According to Apotex, the specification is fatally defective.
[8]
One of the claims of the patent, claim number 7, which on its face is a method or process for preparing (+)-Citalopram, is said to be insufficiently disclosed and is not based on routine techniques which would have been known to the skilled addressee in 1988. The other process claims are also invalid because they are dependent on claim number 7.
[9]
The patent is also allegedly insufficient because it states that "[r] esults upon administration to human beings have been very gratifying". There had actually been no tests on human beings at the time of the application. This constitutes a failure to fully disclose the invention.
[10]
There need not be proof positive to back up statements, or promises, in a specification. The statement may be premised on a prediction, as long as there is a sound basis therefor. As shall be seen, (+)-Citalopram is an enantiomer of the racemate Citalopram, which together with precursors thereof was covered by earlier patents. By 1988, Citalopram had proved useful in the treatment of depression. According to Apotex, the '452 patent promises that (+)-Citalopram is therapeutically more potent than Citalopram. There was no sound basis for making that prediction as (+)-Citalopram had not as then been tested in human beings. The fact that the prediction later turned out to be true is irrelevant.
[11]
I shall deal with both invalidity and infringement. As I stated at trial, no matter my holding on validity, I would deal with infringement. If I were to hold that the patent is invalid, and be reversed in appeal, the likelihood is that the matter would be referred back to me to deal with the counterclaim for infringement. Hence, it is better to cover all aspects of the litigation now.

PATENT CONSTRUCTION
[13]
The starting point of any inquiry into either invalidity or infringement is the language and meaning of the patent within the context of the
Patent Act
(
Free World Trust v Électro Santé Inc
, 2000 SCC 66, [2000] 2 SCR 1024, 9 CPR (4th) 168, [2000] SCJ No 67 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 9 CPR (4th) 129, [2000] SCJ No 68 (QL)).
[14]
Patents are a creature of statute, in this case the
Patent Act
, as it was immediately prior to 1 October 1989.
[15]
Section 34 thereof required that the patent application contain a specification cumulating with a claim or claims "defining distinctly and in explicit terms the subject-matter of the invention for which an exclusive privilege or property is claimed." It must be sufficiently full, clear, concise and exact "as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it pertains, or to which it is most closely connected, to make, construct, compound or use it."
[16]
The claims are to be read in an informed and purposive way so as to permit fairness and predictability and to define the limits of the monopoly. One way of doing this is to separate the essential from the non-essential. As Mr. Justice Binnie stated in
Whirlpool
at paragraph 45:
The key to purposive construction is therefore the identification by the Court, with the assistance of the skilled reader, of the particular words or phrases in the claim that describe what the inventor considered to be the "essential" elements of his invention.
[17]
However, ultimately, it is not for the skilled reader to tell the Court what the patent means; it is for the Court to tell the parties what it means. A patent is not an ordinary document. It meets the definition of a "regulation" in the
Interpretation Act
, and must be read to assure the attainment of its objects. "[C]laims construction is a matter of law for the judge, and he was quite entitled to adopt a construction of the claims that differed from that put forward by the parties." (
Whirlpool
at para 61.)
[18]
Pursuant to section 27 of the
Patent Act
, as it was, an inventor or legal representative thereof was entitled to obtain a patent for:
...an invention that was
(a)
not known or used by any other person before he invented it,
(b)
not described in any patent or in any publication printed in Canada or in any other country more than two years before presentation of the petition hereunder mentioned, and
(c)
not in public use or on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to his application in Canada
...une invention qui
a
) n'était pas connue ou utilisée par une autre personne avant que lui-même l'ait faite,
b
) n'était pas décrite dans quelque brevet ou dans quelque publication imprimée au Canada ou dans tout autre pays plus de deux ans avant la présentation de la pétition ci-après mentionnée, et
c
) n'était pas en usage public ou en vente au Canada plus de deux ans avant le dépôt de sa demande au Canada
[19]
An invention was defined at section 2 as meaning:
[...] any new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter
[...] Toute réalisation, tout procédé, toute machine, fabrication ou composition de matières, ainsi que tout perfectionnement de l'un d'eux, présentant le caractère de la nouveauté et de l'utilité.
II.
THE SKILLED ADDRESSEE
[20]
According to the abstract in the patent specification, the invention relates to the two novel enantiomers of Citalopram and to their use as antidepressant compounds as well as to possible use as geriatrics or in the cure of obesity and alcoholism.
[21]
Citalopram is stated to be 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-1,-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, and is accompanied by a diagram of the chemical formula.
[22]
It goes without saying that the patent is not addressed to this Court as presently constituted. The Court needs the assistance of experts in order to understand its technical aspects. The patent is notionally addressed to a person skilled in the art or science to which the subject matter relates and is to be read as such a person would have read it when it first became public, which was in June 1988. The parties have called a great array of experts to assist the Court in this regard. There is no significant disagreement as to the identity of this hypothetical skilled addressee. He or she is a medicinal chemist, probably with a doctorate, and has spent at least a few years in a laboratory. The addressee is either part of or has access to a team, which includes analytical chemists, familiar with the principles of organic chemistry and techniques then available which could be used in an effort to separate racemic mixtures into their two enantiomers. Access would also be had to pharmacologists, psychiatrists and to drug formulators.
[23]
More shall be said about this skilled addressee under the topic of Obviousness.
III.
AN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY PRIMER
[24]
This case deals with the element "carbon", which is essential to human life. Indeed carbon is the very subject of organic chemistry. There is no disagreement among the experts as to the basic principles involved.
[25]
Drawing upon the opinion of Dr. Martin Semmelhack, a professor of chemistry at Princeton University, called by Apotex, organic chemistry concerns the study of molecules containing carbon atoms. Molecules are collections of atoms arranged in a particular order. Carbon atoms can form bonds both with other carbon atoms and with other atoms. These bonds may take the form of long chains or cyclic structures. They are three-dimensional.
[26]
Atoms bond to each other in various ways. Covalent bonds arise from atoms sharing electrons, while ionic bonds (common in salts) are bonds between charged atoms.
[27]
Turning now to stereochemistry, isomers are molecules which have the same molecular formula but either have different connectivities among the atoms (known as constitutional isomers), or have the same connectivity but different orientation in space (known as stereoisomers).
[28]
Stereoisomers are molecules with the same atoms and the same chemical bonds but different in how they are oriented in space. Two varieties are enantiomers and diastereomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. The word chiral, Greek for handedness, is often used because the two human hands are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers.
[29]
Enantiomers share all the same physical and chemical characteristic such as boiling point, melting point and solubility.
[30]
Because enzymes and protein receptors in the body are chiral, they may react differently with one or the other enantiomer of the same compound.
[31]
When natural substances are recreated in a laboratory, the result is often a 50/50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This mixture is known as a racemate. The two enantiomers within may be identified by whether they rotate a plane of polarized light to the right, identified as the (+) enantiomer, or to the left, identified as the (-) enantiomer. Another method of identifying them is based on the sizing of atoms attached to the carbon centre, in accordance with what are known as the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. In a molecule with a single stereogenic centre, one will be known as the S-enantiomer and the other as the R-enantiomer. There is no direct correlation between the (+) and (-) and the R and the S nomenclatures. Citalopram is S- and (+).
[32]
Because enantiomers have the same physical and chemical characteristics, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to separate them. However, unlike enantiomers, diastereomers have different chemical and physical properties, such as different solubility and melting points. This difference plays an important role in techniques which can be used to resolve a racemate in order to isolate enantiomers. This is one of the fundamental challenges of this case.
[33]
All agree it was common general knowledge in 1988 that racemates could be easily identified by their chemical structure, and that there might well be differences between the two enantiomers, and between each of the enantiomers and the racemate. In terms of medicine, it was also common general knowledge that since one enantiomer might react better than the other with enzymes and protein receptors within the body, one might have more therapeutic effect than the other. The other might even have most unfortunate side effects. However, knowledge of the characteristics of the enantiomers could only be had by resolving the racemate in sufficient quantity to allow for testing.
IV.
THE EXPERTS
[34]
As part of its impeachment case, Apotex called Dr. Martin F. Semmelhack, Dr. Rick Lane Dannheiser, Dr. Peter Jenner, Mr. Thomas Beesley, Dr. John Caldwell and Dr. René Levy. Apotex's factual witnesses were also experts in their own right. Unless ordered otherwise, a party is limited to five experts. However, on consent, I ordered that both parties could call more than five expert witnesses.
[35]
For its part, Lundbeck called Dr. Stephen Graham Davies, Dr. Daniel Wayne Armstrong, Dr. Peter Myers, Dr. Pierre Blier and Dr. Gerd Bode. Lundbeck's factual witnesses were also experts in their own right.
[36]
Then in reply to the evidence of Dr. Davies, Apotex called Sir Jack Baldwin and recalled Dr. Dannheiser.
[37]
Each side called one expert witness with respect to the calculation of profits in the event of infringement.
Dr. Martin Semmelhack
[38]
Dr. Semmelhack is currently the Associate Chair of the Chemistry Department at Princeton University. The focus of his early independent research in the late 1960s at Cornell University was organic synthesis. He is an organic chemist well aware of stereochemistry, racemates and enantiomers. Since the 1970s, he has taught concepts, including the resolution of racemic mixtures and the impact of stereochemistry on biological systems. He is well respected in academia and is a noted author. His career has been spent in academia, except in 1988 and 1989 when he served as Department Head of Medical Chemistry and then as Consulting Director at the Medical Research Division of American Cyanamid. He was qualified as an expert in organic chemistry and organic synthesis. His evidence focused on ways and means Citalopram, or a precursor thereof, could be resolved into its two enantiomers, based on the common general knowledge, literature and techniques readily available to the addressee of the '452 patent in 1988.
Dr. Rick Lane Dannheiser
[39]
Dr. Dannheiser obtained his Ph.D in Organic Chemistry from Harvard University in 1978, the same year in which he joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is their Arthur C. Cope Professor of Chemistry. His laboratory currently deals with the development of new strategies for the synthesis of complex molecules. He too is well published, and was qualified as an expert in organic chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry. Like Dr. Semmelhack, his opinion related to ways and means to arrive at (+)-Citalopram, without recourse to the '452 patent.
Mr. Thomas Beesley
[40]
Mr. Beesley has a master of science degree from St. John's University. His career has been in industry. He was at the forefront of the development of some of the analytical tools for separating racemates, including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), which was cutting-edge technology in the 1980s. In 1983, he came across Dr. Armstrong, called by Lundbeck. Dr. Armstrong was on the lecture circuit promoting molecules known as Cyclodextrins which could facilitate the resolution of various isomers. To that end, he and Dr. Armstrong formed Advanced Separation Technologies Inc (Astec)
.
He was qualified as an expert in chromatography, one of the techniques available to resolve racemates, and, in particular, by the use of chiral HPLC.
Dr. Peter Jenner
[41]
Dr. Jenner is
emeritus
professor of pharmacology at King's College, London. He began his training as a pharmacist. His doctorate at the University of London was in the area of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. He has worked throughout his career with medical chemists, clinical neurologists and psychiatrists. He was qualified as an expert in pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, particularly with respect to centrally active drugs used to treat psychiatric and neurological disorders. His testimony did not relate to ways and means to resolve racemates but rather as to reasons to resolve them. In other words, he dealt with what would have motivated the skilled addressee at the time to arrive at (+)-Citalopram.
Dr. John Caldwell
[42]
Dr. Caldwell served as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Liverpool from 2002 to 2010 and Pro-Vice Chancellor of that University from 2007 until his retirement last year. He is currently professor
emeritus
. He has a Ph.D in Biochemistry from St Mary's Hospital Medical School and in 1987 received his doctorate of science in Pharmacology from the University of London for distinction in drug metabolism. The focus of his work has been upon, among other things, the importance of stereochemistry in drug development. He is an author and editor and serves or has served on the editorial boards of a number of scientific publications. In 1989, he co-founded the journal
Chirality
to address a diverse range of issues relating to stereochemistry, including drug development, pharmacology, synthesis and analysis. He has consulted both with government regulators and industry. Consequently, he qualified to give expert advice as a pharmacologist with expertise in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics and as to the significance of stereochemistry in drug development, including regulatory policy and practice referable thereto. He testified as to the importance of stereochemistry to pharmaceutical companies and government regulators in the 1980s.
Dr. René Levy
[43]
Dr. Levy is professor
emeritus
at the Department of Pharmaceutics at the University of Washington, and advisor to the Metabolism and Transport Drug Interaction Database which he founded in 2002. He obtained his Ph.D in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from the University of California in 1970. In 1977, he became a full professor of pharmaceutical sciences and adjunct professor of neurological surgery at the University of Washington, and served as Chairman of the Department of Pharmaceutics in its School of Pharmacy from its inception in 1980 until 2006. He has specialized in drug metabolism and like the other experts, is a noted author. He was qualified as an expert in metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug products and their metabolites, including the consequences of stereoselectivity therein. He dealt with statements, or implications, in the patent about the use of (+)-Citalopram as an antidepressant in humans, whether it was predicted that it had more therapeutic benefits than Citalopram itself, and whether there was a sound basis for making such a prediction.
Dr. Stephen Graham Davies
[44]
For its part, Lundbeck called Dr. Davies. He has been teaching at the University of Oxford since 1980, where he is the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry. From 2006 to 2011, he was also chairman of its Department of Chemistry. He obtained his Ph.D in Chemistry from Oxford in 1975 and his doctorate of science degree in Chemistry from the University of Paris in 1980. In 1989, he founded and is still editor-in-chief of
Tetrahedron Asymmetry
, a journal which reports advances in knowledge of stereochemistry. In 1991, he founded and is the Director of Oxford Asymmetry International PLC. He has received various awards and has acted as a consultant to a number of pharmaceutical companies. He has given evidence in affidavit form or
viva voce
on behalf of Lundbeck in a number of jurisdictions in which the (+)-Citalopram invention has been challenged.
[45]
There was some debate as to whether he should have been qualified, as proposed by Lundbeck, in medicinal chemistry. In the end, I qualified him as an expert in medicinal chemistry and organic chemistry, including resolution techniques, and stereochemistry. His testimony covered a broad range of topics, including obviousness and insufficiency. He also commented on the expert reports of Drs. Semmelhack, Dannheiser, Caldwell and Jenner.
Dr. Daniel Armstrong
[46]
Dr. Armstrong is the Robert A. Welch Professor of Chemistry at the University of Texas at Arlington. He teaches courses in separation science and directs research at the undergraduate and graduate levels in bio-analytical chemistry, separation science, colloid science and organic chemistry. He has expertise in separation of racemic mixtures by various methods, including fractional recrystallization, kinetic resolutions, direct crystallization of enantiomers and chiral HPLC. He is a named inventor on 14 United States patents, mainly related to the separation of racemic mixtures by HPLC and other separation techniques. As aforesaid, together with Mr. Beesley, he helped found Astec, a company specializing in enantiomeric separations, mainly using Cyclodextrin chiral HPLC columns. He was frequently retained by scientists and clients to attempt to separate enantiomers, and has regularly consulted with both brand name and generic pharmaceutical companies on issues related to the separation of enantiomers. Again, as with the other experts, his credentials, his expertise, his publications and his role on editorial boards are most impressive. He was qualified as an expert in resolution techniques, including chiral HPLC.
Dr. Peter Myers
[47]
Dr. Myers is a professor of separation science in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Liverpool. His career has been split between industry and academia. He has been very much involved in the study and synthesis of silica microparticles for HPLC. Beginning in 1979, he worked with Phase Separations, a United Kingdom company involved in the manufacture and distribution of chromatography products. After its purchase by Waters Corporation, an American company, in 1995, he continued as a consultant. He has been involved in the development of silica products, including products used by Astec, the company established by Dr. Amstrong and Mr. Beesley. He was qualified as an expert in separation science, including chromatography and the manufacture of chromatographic silica. He testified as to the feasibility of arriving at (+)-Citalopram in 1988 by means of chromatography.
Dr. Pierre Blier
[48]
Dr. Blier is currently a full professor at the Department of Psychiatry in cellular and molecular medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa; adjunct professor, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University; adjunct professor, Department of Neuroscience, Carleton University; and Director of the Mood Disorders Research Program at the University of Ottawa's Institute of Mental Heath Research. He obtained his Ph.D in Neuroscience from the Université de Montréal in 1985. He has obtained many peer reviewed research grants and has written extensively. He was qualified as an expert in neuropsychology including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with respect to SSRIs. He is also a physician specializing in the treatment of mental health illnesses, more particularly depression. He testified with respect to the therapeutic benefits of (+)-Citalopram and the promises, if any, in the patent, with respect to its benefits in the treatment of depression in humans in comparison with Citalopram.
Dr. Gerd Bode
[49]
Dr. Bode's expert report was taken as read. He was not cross-examined by Apotex. He has an M.D. and Ph.D and is an expert in pathology, neuropathology, pharmacology and toxicology. His evidence related to the alleged toxicity of (+)-Citalopram Pamoate.
Sir Jack Baldwin
[50]
Apotex called Sir Jack Baldwin to reply to the opinion of Dr. Davies with respect to the "Baldwin Rules", so called, which he had developed in the 1970s. He was Dr. Davies' predecessor as the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at Oxford, and has been the recipient of many awards. A knighthood was conferred upon him in 1997 for his contributions in organic chemistry. He was qualified as an expert in organic, synthetic and biological chemistry. Like Dr. Davies, he has given evidence in other jurisdictions with respect to (+)-Citalopram, however always on the side that submitted the patent should be held to be invalid.
[51]
Finally, Dr. Dannheiser was re-called to take issue with some of Professor Davies' opinions.
[52]
I say, without hesitation, that not only were all these witnesses superbly qualified to offer expert opinion to the Court, but they were, each and every one, over qualified. They are not ordinary medicinal chemists, ordinary analytical chemists, ordinary pharmacologists and what have you. Each and every one is a superstar. The challenge they faced, and the challenge facing the Court, is whether they were able, in a sense, to reduce their expertise to that of the skilled addressee in 1988.
V.
PATENT '452
[53]
The application was filed 13 June 1989. The patent was issued 9 September 1997, good for 17 years. Its priority date is stated to be 14 June 1988, the date of the first patent application which was filed in the United Kingdom. Lundbeck has suggested an April priority date, on the grounds that that was when (+)-Citalopram was invented. However, it did not pursue that point with vigour and, in any event, the experts agree that the situation did not change between April and June 1988.
[54]
Its inventors were two Lundbeck employees: Dr. Klaus Peter Bøgesø and Jens Perregaard.
[55]
To expand upon the abstract, according to Dr. Jenner, the patent is addressed to chemists and pharmacologists with knowledge of antidepressant drugs. It relates to the enantiomers of Citalopram and their use in the treatment of depression in humans. It also relates to methods for obtaining those enantiomers.
[56]
Claims 1 through 5 relate to (+)-Citalopram itself, including in salt form and composition, while claims 6 through 11 relate to an intermediate compound and methods of using that compound to make (+)-Citalopram. These comments are not controversial. What is more controversial is the view of some that there is a prediction that (+)-Citalopram is more potent in humans than Citalopram.
[57]
Dr. Davies notes that the specification states that it had now (in 1988) proved possible to resolve the intermediate diol of Citalopram into its enantiomers and in a stereoselective way to convert those enantiomers to the corresponding Citalopram enantiomers. A "diol" is an alcohol containing two hydroxyl groups in its molecule.
[58]
The patent then sets out two methods of resolution, called "A" and "B"-"C", described in chemical reaction schemes. These reactions involve resolution of the intermediate diol or an ester thereof followed by conversion of the resultant precursor molecules into the enantiomers of Citalopram by the use of specific reagents and conditions. I shall expand upon this later on in these reasons.
[59]
The specification ends with 11 claims:
i. Claim 1 is for Citalopram and non-toxic acid addition salts thereof.
ii. Claim 2 covers the Pamoic Acid Salt of (+)-Citalopram.
iii. Claim 3 covers an antidepressant pharmaceutical composition containing an effective amount of (+)-Citalopram, accompanied by a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or adjuvant.
iv. Claim 4 is identical to claim 3, except that the composition is of the Pamoic Acid Salt of (+)-Citalopram as the active ingredient.
v. Claim 5 is dependent on claims 3 and 4, and is a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form.
vi. Claim 6 is directed to the (-) enantiomer of the intermediate diol, and an ester thereof.
vii. Claim 7 refers to a method of producing (+)-Citalopram.
viii. Claims 8 through 11 are methods dependent on claim 7.
VI.
HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS
[60]
It all began with the PM (NOC) Regulations. They have been the subject of numerous decisions, including those of the Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2005] SCJ No 26 (QL), at paragraphs 5-24; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2008] SCJ No 63 (QL) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), at paragraphs 7 and 12-17.
[61]
In accordance with those Regulations, in April 2007 Apotex served a Notice of Allegation upon Lundbeck Canada Inc., the licensee of the patent. The notice asserted that patent '452 was invalid on various grounds. One of those grounds, an invalid selection patent, was not pursued in this trial. In turn, Lundbeck filed a Notice of Application in this Court, court docket number T-991-07 the following month, in which it sought an order in accordance with the Regulations that the Minister of Health be prohibited from issuing a Notice of Compliance until the expiration of the patent.
[62]
In February 2009, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 53, [2009] FCJ No 249 (QL), I upheld the application and so prohibited the Minister from issuing Apotex a Notice of Compliance. This decision was affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal, 2010 FCA 320, 88 CPR (4th) 325, [2010] FCJ No 1504 (QL). Application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed, SCC Case Information 34066.
[63]
The PM (NOC) Regulations are, in theory, summary in nature. They were not thought binding upon the parties either as to validity or infringement. The issue was simply whether the Minister should have been prohibited from, in effect, licensing Apotex. The parties are entitled to litigate validity and infringement in an action, as opposed to an application. Lundbeck only had to meet the allegations set out in the Notice of Allegation, which did not even raise the issue of non-infringement.
[64]
As I mentioned in those proceedings, a trial is much more to be desired from the judge's point of view, and indeed from the parties' point of view. Unlike in an action, in an application there is no full discovery of documents and examination for discovery. There is no live testimony in court. The evidence is limited to affidavits and cross-examinations thereon. The Court is unable to ask clarifying questions of the expert witnesses. In this trial most of the experts are new and much of the evidence is different.
[65]
It is not all that uncommon that a patent be held invalid at trial, even though the Minister had earlier been prohibited from issuing a Notice of Compliance. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Supreme Court upheld this Court's issuance of a prohibition order. However, at the subsequent trial on the merits, the patent was held to be invalid (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 1, [2011] FCJ No 1813 (QL), currently in appeal).
[66]
This Court has developed the practice, where possible and practicable, to assign the trial to the judge who heard the Notice of Compliance application. The theory is that these pharmaceutical patents have a long learning curve, and so it is better to assign the trial to a judge who has already looked at the patent. This, without more, does not give rise to a conflict of interest, or to an apprehension of bias (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 1692 (QL)).
[67]
I raised this point fairly early on at a trial management conference. The parties were agreeable that I be the trial judge. Indeed, they, Apotex in particular, shaped their evidence to deal with a concern I had had, which was that the experts benefited from hindsight and were not looking at (+)-Citalopram with 1988 eyes.
[68]
I shall now deal with the allegations of invalidity.
VII.
INVALIDITY
A. Anticipation
[69]
The leading Canadian case is the decision of the Supreme Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. Section 27 of the
Patent Act
as it was at the relevant time required, among other things, that the patent be "not described in any patent or in any publication printed in Canada or in any other country more than two years before presentation of the petition hereunder mentioned ..."
[70]
According to Apotex, the claims for (+)-Citalopram itself as a compound, namely claims 1 through 5, are invalid as they were anticipated by the prior disclosure of (+)-Citalopram as a component of Citalopram.
[71]
There were previous patents, issued more than two years before the application, which disclosed Citalopram, for instance US Patent 4,136,193. It was common general knowledge that Citalopram was a racemate, containing equal amounts of (+)-Citalopram and (-)-Citalopram. It was also common general knowledge that the enantiomers might have different therapeutic effects one from the other, and from the racemate itself.
[72]
However, the working of patent '193 or of the intermediate diol disclosed in US Patent 4,650,884 would inevitably result in a racemic mixture, not in separate enantiomers. This is fatal to Apotex's submission.
[73]
The test for anticipation was set out by Mr. Justice Hugessen speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), as follows, at page 297:
One must, in effect, be able to look at a prior, single publication and find in it all the information which, for practical purposes, is needed to produce the claimed invention without the exercise of any inventive skill. The prior publication must contain so clear a direction that a skilled person reading and following it would in every case and without possibility of error be led to the claimed invention.
[74]
This test was approved by the Supreme Court in
Free World Trust
, above.
[75]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Rothstein, after referring to recent English authority, held that there are two aspects to anticipation: prior disclosure and enablement. Prior disclosure means that working the prior patent would necessarily result in infringement thereof.
[76]
He held that the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision only dealt with prior disclosure. Mr. Justice Hugessen had no need to consider whether the working of the invention was also enabled by that disclosure.
[77]
In this case, there was no prior disclosure in that the prior patents did not teach how to resolve Citalopram and did not disclose the therapeutic effects of (+)-Citalopram.
[78]
Apart from the patents, D.F. Smith of the Psychopharmacology Research Unit, Psychiatric Hospital, Risskov, Denmark, had published two articles: "Stereochemical Considerations of the Actions of Some Psychotropic Drugs" in 1985 in
Pharmacopsychiat
and "The Stereoselectivity of Serotonin Uptake in Brain Tissue and Blood Platelets: the Topography of the Serotonin Uptake Area" in 1986 in
Neuroscience & Biobehavorial Reviews
. However, these papers do not explain in any way how to obtain the enantiomers of Citalopram. Furthermore, he predicted that the activity would be concentrated in the R enantiomer while it turns out most of the activity is in the S enantiomer.
B. Obviousness
[79]
Unlike section 28.3 of the
Patent Act
currently in force, the Act at the time did not specifically provide that the subject matter of a claim must not be obvious "to a person skilled in the art or science to which it pertains ..." However, it has always been accepted that section 28.3 is merely declaratory in that by its very definition, an invention must be new ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 51).
[80]
Who then is this skilled addressee?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 9 CPR (4th) 129, [2000] SCJ No 68 (QL), above, at paragraph 42, Mr. Justice Binnie quoted
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 517, to say that the patent must describe the invention "with sufficiently complete and accurate details as will enable a workman, skilled in the art to which the invention relates, to construct or use that invention when the period of the monopoly has expired."
[81]
If the "invention" is obvious to such a person, it is not patentable.
[82]
The skilled addressee in patent law does not exist. He or she is a judicial creation. When applied to the concept of obviousness, Mr. Justice Hugessen stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2008] SCJ No 63 (QL)) at para 52:
The test for obviousness is not to ask what competent inventors did or would have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy.
[83]
Another useful commentary is found in the decision of Mr. Justice Laddie in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the eyes of the skilled but non-inventive man in the art. This is not a real person. He is a legal creation. He is supposed to offer an objective test of whether a particular development can be protected by a patent. He is deemed to have looked at and read publicly available documents and to know of public uses in the prior art. He understands all languages and dialects. He never misses the obvious nor stumbles on the inventive. He has no private idiosyncratic preferences or dislikes. He never thinks laterally. He differs from all real people in one or more of these characteristics. A real worker in the field may never look at a piece of prior art - for example he may never look at the contents of a particular public library or he may be put off because it is in a language he does not know. But the notional addressee is taken to have done so. This is a reflection of part of the policy underlying the law of obviousness. Anything which is obvious over what is available to the public cannot subsequently be the subject of valid patent protection even if, in practice, few would have bothered looking through the prior art or would have found the particular items relied on. Patents are not granted for the discovery and wider dissemination of public material and what is obvious over it, but only for making new inventions. A worker who finds, is given or stumbles upon any piece of public prior art must realise that the art and anything obvious over it cannot be monopolised by him and he is reassured that it cannot be monopolised by anyone else.
[84]
Of course, it is important not to take these words "au pied de la lettre" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  example, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Mr. Justice Rothstein limited Mr. Justice Hugessen's famous statement with respect to anticipation to prior disclosure and not to enablement.
[85]
There are a number of issues to consider, such as:
i. Was (+)-Citalopram obvious to those to whom the patent is addressed?
ii. Was it "obvious to try" the techniques successfully used by Lundbeck?
iii. Was there a motivating factor, or reason to arrive at (+)-Citalopram?
iv. Was it "obvious to try" other techniques?
v. Was it plain and obvious that the techniques used or which could have been used would have been successful?
vi. Would the results of experiments successfully carried out in 2012 have been the same if carried out in 1988? Were such experiments a matter of routine?
vii. Did the inventors have an easy time of it?
[86]
In order to decide whether (+)-Citalpram was obvious, whether it was obvious to apply various techniques and whether it was likely that those techniques would work, it is necessary to understand what Lundbeck actually did. To summarize the evidence of Dr. Semmelhack, the patent described three synthesis processes.
[87]
The first process involves:
i. the conversion of the Citalopram diol to a covalent diastereomeric ester through the addition of an optically pure acid chloride and hydride or labile ester in an inert organic solvent;
ii. the purification of the diastereometers by either chromatography (in particular, HPLC) or crystallization; and
iii. the addition of a strong base to effect a ring closure and yield a single enantiomer of Citalopram.
There is a strong difference of expert opinion with respect this ring closure, which was necessary for chirality.
[88]
The second process resolves the Citalopram diol into its two enantiomers through the addition of an optically active acid, some examples of which were given.
[89]
The third process involves the conversion of the pure enantiomers prepared according to the second process. The synthesis consists of:
i. the conversion of the primary alcohol to labile ester; and
ii. the simultaneous addition of a base in an inert organic solvent at 0 degrees Celsius.
[90]
Apotex submits that what was done was well within the common general knowledge of the skilled addressee and the state of the art in 1988. Certainly, resolution was the most obvious technique. This involved resolution of diastereomers, both covalent and ionic.
[91]
The other technique would be based on chiral HPLC. Notwithstanding that Lundbeck had tried HPLC without success, success should have been expected no matter the method in no more than a week.
[92]
There is a difference of opinion whether one would start with Citalopram itself, or with a precursor. I find that if one did not work, the person skilled in the art would then try the other.
[93]
As I see it, the issue is not so much which techniques the skilled addressee might have used in an effort to arrive at (+)-Citalopram, but rather whether those techniques would have been successful, given the wide range of chemicals and other variables which might be used in the reactions. This boils down to whether or not it was "obvious to try" certain techniques and whether at one point one might give up in frustration. The burden of proof lies with Apotex. The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision, above, which also dealt with a racemate and enantiomers is most instructive. In speaking for the Court, Mr. Justice Rothstein said at paragraph 66:
For a finding that an invention was "obvious to try", there must be evidence to convince a judge on a balance of probabilities that it was more or less self-evident to try to obtain the invention. Mere possibility that something might turn up is not enough.
[94]
He approved the four-step approach developed by Oliver L.J. in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (p. 872), [2007] EWCA Civ 588, at para 23:
In the result I would
restate
the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> questions thus:
(1) (a) Identify the notional "person skilled in the art";
(b) Identify the relevant common general knowledge of that person;
(2) Identify the inventive concept of the claim in question or if that cannot readily be done, construe it;
(3) Identify what, if any, differences exist between the matter cited as forming part of the "state of the art" and the inventive concept of the claim or the claim as construed;
(4) Viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention as claimed, do those differences constitute steps which would have been obvious to the person skilled in the art or do they require any degree of invention?
[95]
Mr. Justice Rothstein was of the view that it was in the fourth step of the
Windsurfing/Pozzoli
approach that the "obvious to try" issue will arise.
[96]
If that approach is warranted, he went on to say at paragraph 69:
If an "obvious to try" test is warranted, the following factors should be taken into consideration at the fourth step of the obviousness inquiry. As with anticipation, this list is not exhaustive. The factors will apply in accordance with the evidence in each case.
1. Is it more or less self-evident that what is being tried ought to work? Are there a finite number of identified predictable solutions known to persons skilled in the art?
2. What is the extent, nature and amount of effort required to achieve the invention? Are routine trials carried out or is the experimentation prolonged and arduous, such that the trials would not be considered routine?
3. Is there a motive provided in the prior art to find the solution the patent addresses?
[97]
At trial, a great deal of evidence was led as to ways and means available in 1988 to separate the enantiomers of Citalopram in sufficient quantity that their characteristics could be tested; whether these techniques would have come to the mind of the skilled addressee and whether he or she would have been bothered to try them. Experiments had been carried out in an effort to show that it either would have been easy to resolve Citalopram, or difficult, depending on who commissioned the experiment.
[98]
Dr. Timothy Ward, who successfully resolved Citalopram in the months before trial, using one of Dr. Armstrong's inventions, said that his experiment was much like following a recipe in a cookbook. If there were not so much case law on point, I would have tended to think that the person who could arrive at the desired result, without benefit of the patent in question,
i.e.
without the cookbook, had a higher skill set than the patent addressee. It is one thing to follow a recipe, quite another to make it.
i. Motivation
[99]
Motivation took on a life of its own. Apotex said there was great motivation at the time to resolve pharmaceutical racemates as regulatory authorities, particularly in the two largest markets, the United States and Japan, were interested. For its part, Lundbeck downplayed motivation. I am troubled by the concept of motivation. Wishing does not make something come true. Wishing does not make something easier. A motive is defined as that which moves or tends to move a person to a particular course of action (
Oxford Dictionary
). On the other hand, there may not have been reason to do something at a particular point in time. For instance, there may have been little interest in increasing automobile fuel efficiency in the 1950s. Lack of interest would not give rise to a patent if what was eventually done was obvious.
[100]
I find that Lundbeck was motivated to resolve Citalopram. It was common general knowledge that each of the three dimensional enantiomers might fit into their receptors in the human body in a different way so that one might be more beneficial than the other. The other, as mentioned above, might have undesirable, or even tragic, side effects.
[101]
Thalidomide was mentioned in that one enantiomer was very beneficial in treating morning sickness in pregnant women while the other caused terrible birth defects. However, the thinking now seems to be that the body converted the good enantiomer back into the racemic mixture,
i.e.
fifty percent of the "good" enantiomer was converted by the body into the "bad" enantiomer.
[102]
The United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) was developing an interest and, indeed, asked Lundbeck's American licensee to provide information with respect to the enantiomers of Citalopram if, as and when they became available. However, it was not, and it is still not, a regulatory requirement that racemates be broken down before they receive FDA approval. That regulatory regime, which requires clinical testing on humans, is quite distinct from the patent regime, although it must be said a patent for a medicine is not particularly useful if the medicine cannot be marketed. It was not necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of (+)-Citalopram through clinical trials on humans if the patent disclosed a rational basis for making a sound prediction that it would prove useful (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2002] SCJ No 78 (QL) at para 3 (AZT)).
[103]
Apart from the professional pride of one of the inventors who testified, Dr. Bøgesø, academics were becoming interested in Citalopram. Lundbeck was concerned that someone else might resolve it first, which would have blocked it from patenting (+)-Citalopram and lead to a diminution of profits in that, at best, there would be cross-licensing agreements.
[104]
While motivation would make it obvious to try to resolve Citalopram, as Mr. Justice Rothstein said at paragraph 65 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, "I am of the opinion that the "obvious to try" test will work only where it is very plain or, to use the words of Jacob L.J., more or less self-evident that what is being tested ought to work." The reference to Lord Justice Jacob is to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (BAILII) at para 35:
Mere possible inclusion of something within a research programme on the basis you will find out more and something might turn up is not enough. If it were otherwise there would be few inventions that were patentable. The only research which would be worthwhile (because of the prospect of protection) would be into areas totally devoid of prospect. The "obvious to try" test really only works where it is more-or-less self-evident that what is being tested ought to work.
[105]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Rothstein also referred to the decision of Mr. Justice Kennedy, speaking for a unanimous United States Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (2007). He quoted Mr. Justice Kennedy at para 58, as follows:
At p. 1742, he was clear that "obvious to try" could be a relevant test in an obviousness inquiry:
The same constricted analysis led the Court of Appeals to conclude, in error, that a patent claim cannot be proved obvious merely by showing that the combination of elements was "obvious to try." . . . When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense. In that instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under §103.
[106]
The facts of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> were very different from those in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and in the case at bar. It dealt with electronic sensors in automobile gas pedals. It was held that mounting a modular sensor on a fixed pivot point of the pedal was a design step well within the grasp of a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art. The patent in issue had been based on a combination of elements found in the prior art. As Mr. Justice Kennedy stated at page 1739:
For over a half century, the Court has held that a patent for a combination which only unites old elements with no change in their respective functions . . . obviously withdraws what is already known into the field of its monopoly and diminishes the resources available to skillful men. [...] The combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results.
[107]
He continued at pages 1741 and 1742:
In determining whether the subject matter of a patent claim is obvious, neither the particular motivation nor the avowed purpose of the patentee controls. What matters is the objective reach of the claim. If the claim extends to what is obvious, it is invalid [...] One of the ways in which a patent's subject matter can be proved obvious is by noting that there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution encompassed by the patent's claims.
[108]
On balance, I find that motivation was a neutral factor. As noted by Mr. Justice Kennedy, the patentee's motivation does not control. There is a balance to achieve. If motivation inspires one to try harder or to think of a wider range of approaches, at some point the experiments are no longer routine. Some inventiveness is involved.
[109]
This case turns on expert opinion. How can the Court decide which opinion is to be preferred? Certainly not on the experts' knowledge of chemistry; not even on their knowledge of chemistry as it was in 1988. Even then, these overqualified experts had far greater skill sets than the ordinary person skilled in the art.
[110]
One way, advanced by Apotex, was to seize upon the fourth question  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> /Pozzoli
, as cited by Justice Rothstein in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> "viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention as claimed." Drs. Semmelhack and Dannheiser were simply given the formula for Citalopram and asked how the hypothetical chemist of ordinary skill would obtain a single enantiomer thereof. On the other hand, Dr. Davies was well familiar with the '452 patent, and foreign variations thereof, as he had testified on behalf of Lundbeck in several previous cases. This factor can hardly be determinative, because, if so, one could only testify once as an expert. At some point, the expert must look at the patent.
[111]
If you do not like the message, shoot the messenger. While Apotex could not challenge Dr. Davies' knowledge of chemistry, it urged me to pay little heed to his opinion because he was part of Lundbeck's litigation team.
[112]
Lundbeck could hardly have been taken aback by this approach because it did the very same thing in the PM (NOC) proceedings. It urged then that the opinion of an expert witness, who was not called in this trial, should be discounted because he had been called upon by Apotex to testify more than 30 times. If he was a man for all patents, then Dr. Davies is said to be a man for one patent, over and over again and again. I refused to downplay an opinion on that basis then and I refuse now.
[113]
For example, it was pointed out that Dr. Davies attended the opening statements. Experts are entitled to be present throughout trial.
[114]
His written opinion in this case, and his testimony, were not on all fours with other cases. However, it should be kept in mind that at times Lundbeck has been the defendant or respondent, and at other times the plaintiff or the applicant. For instance, in the PM (NOC) proceedings, the issues were circumscribed by Apotex's Notice of Application. There was no need for Dr. Davies to deal with what had not been alleged.
[115]
He has always said that there were at least 13 ways in which to separate racemates. It was suggested that he was attempting to make the problem more difficult than it was. The issue, however, is whether or not there were 13 different ways. He was never contradicted. Furthermore, it is clear, at least to me, from reading his report, and from his testimony, that most of these techniques would be immediately discarded by him and by the skilled addressee who looked at the chemical formula of Citalopram or one of its precursors. The statement simply provided context.
[116]
As regards diastereomer separation, the technique successfully used by Lundbeck, he stated in his report "It should be noted that the differences between the two diastereomers produced may well be (and often are) so small that the diastereomers cannot be separated using this method, in particular by crystallization." He did not say that in other reports. However, the issue is not what he said or did not say elsewhere; the issue is whether or not in general that statement is true. He was never contradicted, and so I take it as true. Neither Dr. Semmelhack nor Dr. Dannheiser was particularly fond of crystallization.
[117]
He was a somewhat cautious, hesitant witness, which is not surprising considering the vigour of the cross-examination. While he was not as spontaneous as, say, Dr. Dannheiser, I am not going to pick and choose among the experts based on their personalities. The advice I received was what the experts thought was within the grasp of the skilled addressee at the time, the common general knowledge and the literature searches which could, and should, have been carried out.
[118]
For its part, Lundbeck's submission as to why I should prefer the opinion of Dr. Davies over that of Drs Semmelhack and Dannheiser is that even in 1988 they were pre-eminent experts in the field, and that their knowledge and insight were far and away superior to that of the skilled addressee. There is something to that.
[119]
I turn now to the different techniques which the experts thought the skilled addressee would have contemplated.
ii. Resolution
[120]
Although the experts cited a number of methods by which (+)-Citalopram could be achieved, it all comes down to two methods: chemical resolution and chiral HPLC.
[121]
As to chemical resolution, the principal experts were Drs. Semmelhack, Dannheiser and Davies. Sir Jack Baldwin was brought in to deal with the Baldwin Rules and Dr. Armstrong, who dealt with chiral HPLC, was called upon to comment on resolution techniques in his cross-examination.
[122]
The issue is not so much how to go about it theoretically, but rather whether certain techniques would have been obvious to the "ordinary" medicinal chemist and his or her team in 1988, and whether they would have worked. Drs. Semmelhack and Dannheiser each came up with a resolution method without even having the patent at hand, a method very similar to the patent. Apotex says that since they could do it, having put themselves in the shoes of the "ordinary" medicinal chemist, it was therefore obvious to those to whom the patent was addressed. Lundbeck submits that this simply proves their point that the two doctors were so overskilled they could not put themselves in the shoes of the "ordinary" medicinal chemist in 1988. I agree with Lundbeck.
[123]
Dr. Semmelhack considered a skilled chemist would expect to obtain a single enantiomer in four ways:
i. form diastereomeric salts of Citalopram which could then be separated by fractional crystallization;
ii. form a covalent diastereomer of a diol precursor which could then be separated by fractional crystallization or chromatography;
iii. form a diastereomeric salt of a diol precursor of Citalopram of the compound which could then be separated by fractional crystallization; and
iv. chiral chromatography. However he was not an expert in that area and could not comment.
[124]
The skilled chemist would work from the diol described in US Patent 4650884, issued in 1987, but based on a UK priority date of 1984.
[125]
Citalopram itself is set out in US Patent 4136193, granted in 1979, based on a UK priority date of 1976.
[126]
He explained that the difference between the state of the art and the innovative concept was that the state of the art "contains no explicit recital of the preparation (+)-Citalopram by resolving the (-)-Citalopram-diol and performing a ring closure that avoids racemization at the key stereogenic center". However he thought the skilled chemist would not have needed to exercise any inventive ingenuity because the chemical methodologies set out in the '452 patent were based on fundamental principles of organic synthesis and were well-known.
[127]
He opined that Dr. Bøgesø, one of the inventors, unlike the theoretical addressee, had biases against the diol route. He overlooked the fact that ring closure could be effected in basic conditions. The diol route would be preferred because it would enable chromatographic resolution which would be virtually certain to work.
[128]
At the time, the skilled chemist would have used mainstream techniques to purify, or separate, a given substance. Both fractional crystallization and chromatography exploit differences in the physical and chemical properties of the different components of a given mixture.
[129]
The skilled chemist would use fractional crystallization to exploit the difference between solubilities of components of a mixture and how they crystallize. He or she would form a salt of the compound in question. If it is an acid, a base is added. If it is a base, an acid is added. The acid-base reaction is carried out in a solution which would then be cooled with the hope the substances would crystallize. The crystallized substance or precipitate generally contains more of the less soluble substance, as the more soluble would prefer to remain in the solution. This technique can be repeated time and time again, and has been used for a number of years. That being so, he warned, however, that crystals do not always readily form, and it is not certain that the components of the mixture will have sufficiently different solubilities to allow for purification. However, no such uncertainty is present in the case of chromatography.
[130]
Chromatography (not chiral HPLC) involves:
i. the packing of a tube or column with an absorbent powder which is called the stationary phase;
ii. applying the molecule to be purified to that phase;
iii. pouring the mobile phase or solvent through the column; and
iv. collecting the material that passes through. Different material will be eluted at different times because the different components of the mixture form attractions of different strengths with the stationary phase.
[131]
As to the literature search, he personally had no need but the skilled addressee could refer to some standard textbooks and some specific to stereochemistry, including Jacques, Collet and Wilen:
Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions,
1981, and Eliel,
Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds
, 1962. The skilled chemist would also review a number of well-known chemical journals including
Journal of American Chemical Society
,
Angewante Chemie
,
Journal of Organic Chemistry, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Tetrahedron
,
Tetrahedron Letters, Journal of the Royal Chemical Society (Chemical Communications, Perkin Series)
and
Synthesis
.
[132]
One would use
Chemical Abstracts
to search for patents and journal articles. This was a non-computerized keyword system.
[133]
The skilled chemist would reject certain methods such as chiral pool or asymmetric synthesis. The best way to obtain gram quantities to allow for analysis would be by resolution of diastereomers. The skilled chemist would recognize that the diol possessed functional groups or "handles" which made resolution by formation of a covalent diastereomer obvious and easy to carry out. There would be almost no risk of ring closure failure.
[134]
In his opinion, a skilled chemist at the time would have been able to develop a scheme based solely on general knowledge without consulting any literature. However a search would turn up Baldwin's
Rules for Ring Closure
, 1976. These rules would show that when a nucleophile and a leaving group in the same compound are separated by four carbons, a ring closure is favoured under the appropriate conditions. The diol would be so favoured. Atoms can be linked by single, double or triple bonds. If all atoms in a compound are linked by single bonds, the compound is said to be fully saturated. If certain atoms are double or triple bonded, the compound is said to be unsaturated. Although the diagrams in the Baldwin paper do not show unsaturated systems, the skilled chemist - but as it turns out not Dr. Davies - would not conclude that the rules apply only to completely saturated systems.
[135]
There would be an SN2 reaction. He said at paragraph 172 of his report: "Selecting an appropriate leaving group and setting up basic conditions for deprotonation reactions are part of the routine work of the skilled chemist and are neither time consuming nor challenging." He had an opportunity to review Lundbeck's laboratory notes and noted Mosher's acid chloride being used to form a covalent diastereomeric ester of the Citalopram diol. He did not think this particularly unusual as there is a reference thereto in one of the leading specialist texts:
Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions
, 1981, by Jacques, Collet and Wilen.
[136]
Dr. Dannheiser was also of the view that chemical resolution would be the preferred method to use to arrive at the enantiomers of Citalopram. In so doing, he rejected other possibilities such as asymmetric synthesis, chiral pool and kinetic resolution.
[137]
In 1988, the skilled addressee would form covalent diastereomers of the diol precursor and then separate them from each other using chromatography. The separated diastereomers could then be readily converted into the enantiomers of Citalopram. In his view, this was straightforward chemistry. Although a separation process could be carried out by crystallization, chromatography would be more suitable at it would exploit differences between compounds to a greater extent.
[138]
Chemical resolution would be the preferred method because a look at Citalopram shows that the compound has one stereogenic centre. There is a six membered-aromatic ring with a fluorine and a three-carbon chain ending in a dimethylamino group. One would recognize that the compound contains the following functional groups:
i. a nitrate nitrile (
i.e.
cyano) group;
ii. a tertiary amine group;
iii. two aromatic rings;
iv. a five-membered cyclic ether.
One would recognize that the compound contains a phthalan or dihydroisobenzofuran core.
[139]
The skilled addressee would have a strong expectation of success by forming covalent diastereomers of the 1,4-diol precursor using ordinary chromatography to separate those diastereomers and then to convert them into the enantiomers of Citalopram. The diol would be chosen because it features a primary hydroxyl group for preparing covalent diastereomers and in the main group for the formation of salts. The central challenge would be the construction of the five-membered cyclic ether with a quaternary (fully substituted) carbon attached to the oxygen atom.
[140]
The most common method for the synthesis of such ethers involved a reaction called a "nucleophilic substitution" with an alcohol functioning as the nucleophilic partner. This reaction is one in which the nucleophile replaces a leaving group. The leaving group is an atom or a group of atoms that is able to accept the electron density of the bond that breaks during a substitution or elimination reaction. Under basic conditions the skilled chemist would know it would be necessary to convert one hydroxyl group into a leaving group in order to achieve cyclization.
[141]
Once diastereomeric esters were separated, one would cleave the ester to provide the enantiomers of the diol. This would not compromise the stereogenic centre and, therefore, no racemisation would take place. There are various ways and means by which this could be done, including saponification with an aqueous base or reduction using a reducing agent.
[142]
The chemist could choose from a variety of chiral acids described in the literature and discussed in Jacques
et al
's book. This would include tartaric acid. The chemist would choose solvents such as alcohols and focus on chiral acid and solvent combinations that resulted in crystalline salts with the amine and would vary concentrations, temperature and amounts.
[143]
Dr. Davies had a different point of view. He agreed that diastereomers have more or less pronounced differences in their physical properties and may possibly be separated by distillation, crystallization or chromatography.
[144]
He described Citalopram as follows: the core of the molecule is a dihydroisobenzofuran core (also called a phthalan structure). Attached to this core is the -C=N group which is referred to as a nitrile or cyano, depending on context. There is also an aromatic ring (benzene) with a fluorine atom, and finally a three-carbon chain which ends with a tertiary amine. This means that the nitrogen atom is linked to three carbon atoms with no hydrogen atom. He then discussed five-membered cyclic ethers and conformation. Electron pairs repel each other so the favourite shape of more complicated molecules is one which seeks to minimize the interaction of electron pairs on adjacent atoms as well as around all the individual atoms.
[145]
He then discussed nucleophiles and electrophiles. Nucleophiles are electron rich and characterized by a lone pair of electrons, for instance water (H2O) and ammonia (NH 3). Electrophiles are electron poor and are prepared to form a new covalent bond using a pair of electrons provided to them by another atom or molecule. They carry either a positive or a partial positive charge. A new bond can be formed when a nucleophilic reagent approaches an electrophilic reagent. As an example, when ammonia reacts with hydrogen chloride (HCL), both gases, ammonium chloride is produced, a solid salt.
[146]
He went on to discuss nucleophilic substitution reactions. When a nucleophile reacts with a carbon atom there is a partial positive charge due to being bonded to a more electronegative atom or group of atoms. The result is the electronegative atom is lost as a leaving group as it is substituted by the nucleophile. There are two main mechanisms known as SN1 and SN2, both of which can be used in ring closure reactions. SN1 is a two-step process. In the first step, a group, the leaving group, is lost to give a positively charged intermediate. In the second step, the nucleophile attacks the intermediate from either side to give the product. This reaction is not stereospecific, so that even if a single enantiomer of the starting material is used, substitution by this SN1 process will generally result in a racemate.
[147]
SN2 substitution is a single-step process. The nucleophile must attack the central carbon atom at a 180 degree angle from the leaving group at the same time as the leaving group departs. When a single enantiomer of the starting material is used, an SN2 process results in a single enantiomer of the product. If a single enantiomer of a chiral nucleophile is employed in the substitution reaction with a non-chiral starting material, the process will result in a single enantiomer of the product, regardless of whether the reaction occurs through a SN1 or SN2 pathway. When an SN2 reaction occurs, the molecular shape and orientation are important as the various reactive parts need to line up correctly.
[148]
In his view, the difference between saturated and non-saturated systems is most important. A saturated system is one that contains no carbon-carbon double bonds. An unsaturated system contains a carbon-carbon double bond; the two ends cannot approach so easily due to the rigid shape surrounding the double bond.
[149]
The Citalopram molecule is a base because it comprises an amino group. This free base can thus make a salt with an acid.
[150]
In his view, a literature search in 1988 would not have been as routine as suggested by Drs. Semmelhack and Dannheiser, neither of whom actually performed a search as if it were 1988. While today one might use an internet search engine such SciFinder, at the time one would be using hard copies of the
Chemical Abstract
. With respect to Citalopram, one would have looked for patents and used keywords such as "Citalopram", "Phthalan" and "Isobenzofuran". Broader terms would have turned up far too many documents, most of which would be irrelevant. The skilled person would also look for specific resolution methods, using keywords such as "enantiomers", "diastereomers", "resolving agents" and "chiral HPLC". These searches would have been time consuming and would have to be found within a library or ordered from other libraries. A thorough search would require several trips to a library and often would take a few weeks.
[151]
As to common general knowledge, he opined that one would resort to a leading textbook, the 5th Edition of Morrison and Boyd's
Organic Chemistry
. He also referred to three specialized books which he did not think the person skilled in the art would have had readily at hand. One was the book by Jacques, Collet and Wilen, which he considered very advanced. He was surprised that Dr. Bøgesø had recourse to it.
[152]
He was of the view that resolution was a black art and was a special kind of job that required a special kind of approach, as indeed noted by Morrison and Boyd.
[153]
The difference between the innovative concept and the state of the art is that the '452 patent is for a new substance useful as an anti-depressant. The prior art did not disclose or enable the manufacture of this enantiomer of Citalopram. It had never been made before. Its properties had never been established; they were unknown and unexpected. The process it disclosed is novel and inventive.
[154]
Unlike Drs. Semmelhack and Dannheiser, he was of the view that the skilled person would have first attempted to resolve Citalopram, rather than a precursor or derivative thereof, of which there were more than one. However, as above said, I think someone interested in obtaining the enantiomers of Citalopram would have used one compound and if that failed, would use another. However, it is quite true that using the diol involves an additional chemical step. Converting the diol to Citalopram required ring closure to form a five-membered oxygen containing a Phthlan ring which puts in issue the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms and the fixed 180 degrees chemistry. There are distinctions between saturated and non-saturated systems which led him to the Baldwin Rules.
[155]
In commenting on Dr. Dannheiser's report, he said that the Baldwin Rules analysis had been based on saturated systems and did not take into account disfavoured stereoelectronics of the transition state in unsaturated systems such as Citalopram. In his opinion, the Rules might form the basis of quibbling among academics but would not have provided any guidance to the person skilled in the art in 1988. In his opinion, the Baldwin Rules only related to saturated systems and a skilled reader would not consider them because the closure of the intermediate diol occurred in a non-saturated system, of which Citalopram is one. The Citalopram diol had an unsaturated double bond in the linking chain and so did not fall within the "favoured" molecules specified by Dr. Baldwin.
[156]
This led Apotex to call Sir Jack Baldwin in reply. Lundbeck first attempted to have his report struck on the grounds that Apotex was "sand-bagging" I do not think that was the case. In any event, a compromise was reached in that I gave Lundbeck leave to recall Dr. Davies in sur-reply, which it did not.
[157]
Dr. Baldwin testified that although the examples in his rules were of saturated systems, the skilled person would know they applied to unsaturated systems as well. In the 25 years they worked together, Dr. Davies never expressed the opinion he has in this case. More to the point, however, is that in those 25 years the two of them never once discussed the Baldwin Rules! I find that while Dons might, or might not, discuss the Rules over a cup of tea, they would not have come to the mind of the ordinary chemist and led him or her to conclude that something was obvious to try.
[158]
Indeed, to make his point that his rules would apply to both saturated and unsaturated systems, Dr. Baldwin referred to an article in 1989 about Japanese beer hops. I do not care how widely read the "ordinary" medicinal chemist working in a pharmaceutical lab post-1988 was. Although post-art may simply confirm the obvious, I simply cannot accept that he or she would have come across that article and be inspired, although unimaginatively, to carry out one chemical reaction rather than another.
[159]
Another example of the experts debating at a level far beyond the unimaginative skilled addressee of the patent who, of course, had not read it, is the "contretemps" between Dr. Dannheiser and Dr. Davies. Dr. Dannheiser, unlike Dr. Davies, was of the opinion that the ordinary chemist in 1988 would have regarded an SN2 type ring closure to be a reasonable step in the synthesis of an enantiomer of Citalopram.
[160]
On the other hand, Dr. Davies thought that such a chemist would have knowledge of stereochemical principles and would have performed a conformational analysis which would have led him or her away from SN2 ring closures. In his reply report, Dr. Dannheiser doubted that this skilled addressee had a sophisticated enough knowledge of stereochemical principles to perform the analysis presented by Dr. Davies. However, if that chemist had such knowledge, then he or she would also have considered what is known as the Curtain-Amath principle.
[161]
This led Lundbeck to move that Dr. Davies be called in sur-reply. I dismissed that motion as Lundbeck had full opportunity to impugn Dr. Dannheiser in cross-examination. What I said in my order of 7 December 2013 holds true for the case as a whole: "Thus, the prime issue, really, is what two over-qualified experts in 2012 would think an ordinary pharmaceutical chemist would have thought of doing in 1988."
iii. Chiral HPLC
[162]
The three experts called on this point were Mr. Beesley, Dr. Armstrong and Dr. Myers.
[163]
Dr. Myers gave an excellent summary of high performance liquid chromatography, both basic (or achiral) and chiral. Liquid chromatography was developed a century ago by the Russian botanist Mikhail S. Tswett. He separated compounds of leaf pigments extracted from plants using a solvent in a column packed with particles. He used powered chalk and alumina. He poured the extract of homogenized plant leaves into the column followed by a pure solvent. As the sample passed through the column, bands of different colours, corresponding to the different compounds originally contained in the sample, could be seen separating. The reason was that some of the compounds that were more strongly attracted to the particles slowed down while others more strongly attracted to the solvent moved faster. The name chromatography derives from the Greek words
chroma
, meaning colour, and
graph
, meaning writing.
[164]
HPLC, now defined as high performance liquid chromatography, was originally known as high pressure liquid chromatography because of the high pressure used to generate the flow of the solvent. In the early 1970s, pumps could generate pressures of about 35 bar (atmospheres) but later on new pumps developed up to 400 bar. The instruments continued to improve such as the injectors, detectors and columns.
[165]
HPLC is a technique designed to separate, quantify and analyze components of a chemical mixture. The sample is a liquid which is injected into a solvent (known as the mobile phase) that is pressured through a column packed with specialized particles (known as the stationary phase) to separate components of the mixture. Dimensions of the column can vary. The operating pressures are dependent on the particle size used in the column. Generally, the smaller the particle size the higher the pressure needed. Small particles are generally preferred as they produce better separation.
[166]
The main variables are the mechanical separation power, as described, and a chemical separation power created by the competition for compounds between the packing material and the mobile phase. There are four interactions that can be used to create HPLC separations:
i. polarity;
ii. electrical charge;
iii. molecular size; and
iv. chirality.
[167]
The mobile phase and the stationary phase will have different polarities. Given the example of oil and water, the stationary phase is oil, which is non-polar, and the mobile phase is water, which is polar. In that case, polar compounds will stay in the mobile phase while non-polar will be retained on the oil stationary phase.
[168]
With respect to HPLC columns, including chiral HPLC columns, in the 1980s they were most commonly packed with porous silica particles. There has been great improvement in the sizing of these particles, which increases the surface area of the stationary phase. The silica particles are naturally polar. However, the most common form of HPLC is reversed phase because polar sample mixtures are more common. The silica surface is modified to make it non-polar by adding long hydrocarbon chains. This modification is called bonding. Non-polar compounds in the sample will form an attraction with the hydrocarbon groups bonded, which slows them down going within the column. Polar molecules in the same sample will pass through more quickly.
[169]
Dr. Myers said that chiral separations occur through reversible diastereomeric association between an enantiomeric solute and chiral stationary phase that is absorbed or bonded onto a stationary phase.
[170]
Turning now to Mr. Beesley, who testified before Dr. Myers, I must say he is a great salesman.
[171]
He promoted Astec products, particularly the Cyclodextrin columns developed by Dr. Armstrong throughout the 1980s. He gave presentations in North America and Europe to various pharmaceutical companies and to the FDA. He focussed on the ability of these columns to separate beta blockers, vasodilators, steroids and barbiturates. He was also retained by various companies to assist in resolving racemic drugs. In his view, the skilled addressee would be familiar with and would have had experience using chromatography. He noted that apart from chiral HPLC, there were other methods to obtain enantiomers, including the resolution of Citalopram or an intermediate thereof by the formation of diastereomers. He limited himself to HPLC, his area of expertise, just as Drs. Semmelhack and Dannheiser had no particular expertise in HPLC.
[172]
Mr. Beesley thought that the ordinary pharmaceutical chemist would have chosen the â-Cyclodextrin and Acetylated â-Cyclodextrin chiral stationary phases sold commercially by Astec as part of the Cyclobond 1 series and the Chiralcel OD column sold commercially by Daicel and J.T. Baker. The chemist would have chosen these columns rather than others which were available because of the structural features of Citalopram.
[173]
Apotex caused experimental testing to be carried out in Jackson, Mississippi and in Toronto on an Acetylated â-Cyclodextrin and a Chiralcel OD column, which experiments were successful and with respect to which more shall be said. The experiment carried out in Mississippi by Dr. Timothy Ward who prepared a stationary phase by bonding Acetylated â-Cyclodextrin to five ìm silica. It should be noted that Dr. Ward is a chemistry professor who was a student of Dr. Armstrong in the 1980s, who co-published with him and who is an acknowledged expert when it comes to Cyclodextrins.
[174]
By 1988, a pharmaceutical company would have had at least one and more likely multiple chiral columns and could likely have consulted Astec, J.T. Baker or Daicel, or other column manufacturers to obtain assistance in the "unexpected event" that difficulties were encountered.
[175]
One point he makes, as does Dr. Armstrong, is that Astec had, from time to time, been requested to develop chiral methods for pharmaceutical companies, or to resolve their racemic drugs.
[176]
At the time, there were more than 30 commercially available chiral stationary phases. The ordinary pharmaceutical chemist would have been aware that most would not have been appropriate given the structure of the compound. In fact, 28 would have been rejected outright, including the first columns developed by a Dr. Pirkle. I pause to mention that Lundbeck had approached Dr. Pirkle, who said he doubted that his columns could be used to resolve Citalopram.
[177]
Reverting to Dr. Myers, although analytical columns were available in 1988, and even some semi-preparative and preparative columns, which would give a greater yield, high pressure and high flow rate pumps were not available so that preparative chromatography was limited to larger particles and indifferent in result because of the lower separating power of these particles.
[178]
As to silica bonding, there are many variables involved such as choice of solvent, temperature, catalyst, and the type and function of the silicon hydrocarbon linkage group. Manufacturers keep, and kept, their precise methods confidential.
[179]
He was of the view that the packing of the silica particles into a stainless steel column was a black art. There were differences in the hardware, the type of columns used, the slurry solvents, the pushing solvents, the pressure utilized, the flow rates and the flushing solvents. "Packing a column" was a difficult task and certainly not something an ordinary chemist would have done on a regular basis. There have been great developments in particle sizes. The smaller the better. In the 1970s and 1980s, that material was usually five or ten micron. However, by the end of the 1980s there was a move to three micron material, but those particles could not be used in HPLC columns because sufficiently high pressure pumps were not available.
[180]
It is his opinion that resolving Citalopram by chiral chromatography prior to June 1988 was not obvious, and may not have even been possible. Indeed, the technology was evolving so quickly it is difficult to pinpoint what could have been used. There were changes in the columns, the silica, the packing, the instruments, the fittings, the detectors, the pumping system, and the software. It is difficult to comment on what was known and what could have been done in June 1988. He questions Mr. Beesley's choice of the Acetylated â-Cyclodextrin and Chiralcel OD columns and assumes he was influenced by post-facto information or hindsight. Those two columns were not well known in June 1988 and he is at a loss to understand why the skilled addressee would have picked them instead of others. Of course, it may be that Mr. Beesley had specific knowledge about these columns, particularly the Cyclobond columns as he was involved in their commercialization. If the Chiralcel OD column was available in June 1988, it was not widely known within the scientific community.
[181]
Dr. Myers also commented on the experiments commissioned by Apotex which were carried out in 2012 in Mississippi and in Toronto. Those comments shall be grouped together with those of others.
[182]
Turning now to Dr. Armstrong, like Mr. Beesley, he had personally performed a great many experiments and used many techniques for separating racemic mixtures. He had been called upon independently and in association with Astec by clients to attempt to separate racemic mixtures by using chiral HPLC columns.
[183]
In his report he stated that chiral HPLC works as follows. A homogenous solution of a racemate is injected at the top end of the column. The components will travel down at different velocities depending on their interaction with the stationary phase. As material comes out of the columns it goes through a detector which produces a signal that is proportional to its concentration in the mobile phase. That signal is recorded to produce a graph known as a chromatogram.
[184]
He disagrees with Mr. Beesley that the ordinary skilled chemist would have been able to separate Citalopram in a matter of days. He had been retained by scientists at pharmaceutical companies to separate racemic mixtures after they had spent a year or more attempting to separate, unsuccessfully.
[185]
In his opinion, it was not obvious to successfully obtain Citalopram and non-toxic acid addition salts via chiral HPLC because Citalopram is a compound that contains chiral amines. One would first have attempted to react it with chiral acids to form diastereomeric salts. These salts were easier to separate by conventional means and in preparative quantities, which is what Lundbeck tried to do.
[186]
Although there was a possibility that chiral HPLC could work, the technique was not promising enough to say it was plain, routine or self-evident that it would. The fact that it had been used to separate other racemates does not mean it could be used to resolve Citalopram and especially to collect the necessary quantities. Semi-preparative or preparative scale chiral columns were rarely used at that time and were often not available.
[187]
The Acetylated â-Cyclodextrin was only available in analytical size and would not have been the choice of an ordinary chemist. He was also of the view that the Chiralcel OD column was not commercially available, or if it was it was so new that it would not have been an obvious choice.
[188]
Although the chemist of ordinary skill would have been aware that chiral HPLC columns existed and could be used to separate compounds on an analytical scale, he or she would have had little or no experience. Even he, as a true expert at the time, had not yet done any work with semi-preparative or preparative chiral columns.
[189]
Chiral HPLC would not have been his first choice to try to resolve Citalopram. He would have thought that fractional crystallization would work. However, in using chiral HPLC, one had to choose the chiral column and then select suitable conditions such as mobile phase, flow rate, pH, temperature, etc. There was little guidance at the time. In 1987, he authored a paper in which he said that the resolution of enantiomers was one of the more difficult problems in separation science, an area open for investigation. There were at least 35 columns available at the time. His short list would have included:
a. á1-acid glycoprotein (AGB) columns;
b. Cyclodextrin-based columns;
c. Pi-complex CSP columns, including those developed by Dr. Pirkle. He thought there was not a high likelihood of success but it was common to try them because they had the longest and largest publication history.
d. Coated cellulosic CSPs.
[190]
In fact, Lundbeck had commissioned efforts on an AGB column, which was the most dominant one used for separating chiral amines. It did not work for Citalopram.
[191]
Notwithstanding that he had been involved in developing the Acetylated â-Cyclodextrin column favoured by Mr. Beesley, it was not well known at the time. Even he did not know what to expect. The only reported separation was for another compound which was not an amine and not similar to Citalopram in any way.
[192]
A very minor difference in one part of a molecule as compared to another can lead to different results. That was known in 1988. A reference is to be found in a report he had authored with Dr. Ward and others in
Analytical Chemistry
: "An Enantiomeric Resolution and Chiral Recognition of Racemic Nicotine and Nicotine Analogues by â-Cyclodextrin Complexation. Structure-Enantiomeric Resolution Relationships in Host-Guest Interactions".
[193]
The Cyclobond Handbook referred to by Mr. Beesley did not come out in 1987. Rather, it could not have come out before the end of 1988 as it cites articles published in the latter part of that very year.
[194]
Even if Chiralcel OD columns were available in June 1988, and he is not satisfied that they were prior to 1989, they would have been so new that they would not have formed part of the common general knowledge of the skilled analytical chemist. They had only been used in that general time frame to separate beta blockers. Other columns had been so used as well. It was only in the 1990s that Chiralcel OD became known as one of the most versatile columns, and it still is. Indeed, at the first international short course on chiral separation that took place in Bradford, England in March 1988, very little was said about the Chiralcel OD column.
[195]
To summarize his opinion, it was not at all obvious to use an HPLC column, and it was not at all obvious that it would work.
iv. The experiments
[196]
Lundbeck was invited by Apotex to witness an experiment in June 2012 in Jackson, Mississippi. Apotex had retained Dr. Timothy Ward to attempt to resolve Citalopram by means of Chiral HPLC, more particularly with Acetylated â-Cyclodextrin material. Dr. Ward retained a Mr. Smuts to actually pack the columns. The columns used were not 1988 columns. There is considerable controversy as to whether Dr. Ward based himself on a 1984 patent of Dr. Armstrong or on a post-1988 protocol prepared by Astec. It is not necessary to resolve these credibility issues as I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the experiment, which was successful, establishes that the same result would have occurred in 1988. One need go no further than to the fact that the silica gel used in the stationary phase was not the same silica gel which was available at that time. That had significant impact on the efficacy and selectivity of the column.
[197]
I accept the evidence of Dr. Myers who, despite valiant efforts, was not at all shaken on cross-examination. Dr. Armstrong's patent called for Spherisorb, which was sold by Dr. Myers' company. It was not available last year and so Nucleosil was used. In Mr. Beesley's view that was a suitable alternative. However, as Dr. Myers pointed out the two silicas have quite different characteristics as regards pore size, pore volume, surface and sodium level. Consequently, the bonding will be very different. Furthermore, a modern HPLC system had been used to run the Mississippi experiment. This would result in an increased efficiency of resolution.
[198]
Dr. Armstrong also testified that the silica was different from the silica which would have been used in 1988 and that Dr. Ward did not do the synthesis as described in his patent and as it would have been done in 1988. The Cyclodextrin prepared by Dr. Ward would have had a different stability and selectivity than the commercial version available in 1988.
[199]
Apotex commissioned a second experiment carried out in Toronto by Dr. Mark Taylor in July 2012. He used a Chiralcel OD column. The experiment was successful, but again I hold on the balance of probabilities that it does not accurately reflect the results of an experiment which would have been carried out on such a column, even if available, prior to June 1988.
[200]
The provenance of the column is most unsatisfactory. The column had been provided to Apotex's solicitors by Dr. William John Lough of the University of Sunderland. He testified as a factual witness. He worked at Beecham Pharmaceuticals from 1980 to 1988. He then joined academia and has been at the University ever since. However, he maintained contact with Beecham and had an industrial placement program for students, one of whom Amjad Khan joined what was then known as SmithKline Beecham. At some time, perhaps close to 2001, Mr. Khan gave him a Chiralcel OD column. The metal tag on it bares the mention "Summer 1992". Dr. Lough could not say what was within the column, and as it has never been dismantled, no one knows. It remained in a drawer for years.
[201]
Apart from the fact that Dr. Taylor obtained better results than those reported by Rochat in 1995, one of the leaders in the field, as noted by Dr. Myers HPLC columns do not age well. They have voids and although usually stored in a suitable solvent, over time the solvent evaporates and in so doing the silica bed dries and causes movement resulting in greater void formation and reduced column efficiency.
[202]
If we assume that 1992 reflects the year the Chiralcel OD column was manufactured, and we have no evidence as to when it was manufactured, Dr. Armstrong points out the columns went through considerable changes from 1988 to 1992. Silica, silica pre-treatments, chiral agents and additives were under constant refinement. Coated Chiralcel OD columns often change selectivity with time or use, perhaps because of the changing secondary structure of the chiral polymer and/or losses of the coated chiral selector over time. Furthermore, the conditions used by Dr. Taylor were found in a publication by Dr. Krstulovic dated October 1988,
i.e.
post the invention.
v. Lundbeck's Efforts
[203]
Lundbeck had been extensively examined on discovery, and called a number of witnesses at trial. The ease by which, or difficulty by which, the inventors achieved the desired result is but a secondary factor in determining whether or not the invention, so called, was obvious.
[204]
One of the inventors, Dr. Bøgesø, explained in great detail Lundbeck's trials and tribulations over an eight-year period. This work was sporadic, however, as Lundbeck had other work at hand. Various methods and chemicals had been used on Citalopram and on its diol before separation was finally achieved. Chiral HPLC had also been used without success. Outside consultants had been called in.
[205]
Dr. Bøgesø is only one of the two named inventors on the patent. The other is Jens Perregaard. Although his lab notes were produced, he was not called as a witness. Apotex submits that an adverse inference should be drawn: that his evidence would not have helped Lundbeck's cause.
[206]
I am not prepared to so infer. The evidence is that Mr. Perregaard left Lundbeck some years ago, and is not under their control. Furthermore, even if it could be said that he resolved Citalopram without difficulty that would not prove that it would have been obvious to the skilled addressee. As Mr. Justice Hugessen pointed out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : inventors are, by their very nature, inventive.
[207]
The history within Lundbeck, as the courts have held, is merely a secondary factor, and one which plays a neutral role in this case. It is said that (+)-Citalopram would have been achieved earlier had it not been for a bias Dr. Bøgesø had against the precursor. Even if that be so, no matter when it was done, the invention was obvious then or it was not. If it could have been achieved earlier this would have been before the advances in Chiral HPLC relied upon by Apotex.
vi. Mosaic of Prior Art
[208]
A great deal of time and effort has been focused on a literature search. No chemist in 1988 would have had the motivation to search that a dozen lawyers and paralegals armed with computers had throughout the trial; literally hundreds of articles were produced in an effort to establish that (+)-Citalopram was obvious, or that it was not.
[209]
Even taking the skilled addressee to have read everything, he or she must still connect the dots.
[210]
As stated by Madam Justice Snider in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 241, [2008] FCJ No 1094 (QL), at para 254:
As acknowledged by Servier, a mosaic of prior art may be assembled in order to render a claim obvious. Even uninventive skilled technicians would be presumed to read a number of professional journals, attend different conferences and apply the learnings from one source to another setting or even combine the sources. However, in doing so, the party claiming obviousness must be able to demonstrate not only that the prior art exists but how the person of ordinary skill in the art would have been led to combine the relevant components from the mosaic of prior art. This case is a good example. Apotex asks the Court to conclude that a person of ordinary skill in the art, without inventiveness or ingenuity, could collate a relatively large number of discrete pieces of knowledge from a lengthy list of prior art on ACE inhibitors (and even some sources outside the ACE inhibition field), make some fundamental assumptions and combine this knowledge to come up with a perindopril molecule.
[211]
As Mr. Justice Kelen later noted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 158, [2010] FCJ No 46 (QL), at paragraph 84, the party claiming obviousness must not only be able to demonstrate that the prior art exists, but to show how the person of ordinary skill in the art would have been led to combine the relevant components from the mosaic of prior art. See also the decision of Madam Justice Gauthier, as she then was, in
Eli Lilly and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 1, [2009] FCJ No 1229 (QL), at paragraphs 416 and following.
[212]
I have come to the conclusion that the invention was not obvious. To utilize the approach used by the Supreme Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the notional "person skilled in the art" and that person's relevant common general knowledge have been set out throughout these reasons. The innovative concept of the claim was a substance, (+)-Citalopram, useful as an anti-depressant, a substance which had never been created before. The prior state of the art did not explain how to achieve (+)-Citalopram and did not disclose the qualities of the two enantiomers. These differences constituted steps which would not have been obvious to the person skilled in the art. They required a degree of invention. It was not more or less evident that what was done ought to have worked.
[213]
The chemical resolution route simply gave rise to too many permutations and combinations. The key problem was the maintenance of chirality. The ring had to be broken and then re-formed with different components. This led to the intense debate with respect to SN1 and SN2 ring closures. It is one thing to theorize as Drs. Semmelhack and Dannheiser did that the work could be done easily, and quite another to successfully carry out the experiments in the laboratory. For instance, in fractional crystallization, a process which gave rise to concern on the part of Drs. Semmelhack and Dannheiser but was the first which came to Dr. Armstrong's mind, Drs. Semmehack, Davies and Bøgesø all noted that the simple scratching of the flask in which the reaction was occurring might make a difference. Dr. Semmelhack pointed out that one might also reduce the temperature, evaporate the solvent, use a less powerful solvent to reduce solubility or change the pH.
[214]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2008] SCJ No 63 (QL)), at paragraph 65, Mr. Justice Rothstein said: "I am of the opinion that the "obvious to try" test will work only where it is very plain or, to use the words of Jacob L.J. more or less self-evident that what is being tested ought to work." I am of the opinion that it was not obvious that any particular chemical reaction ought to have worked.
[215]
As regards chiral HPLC, I am of the opinion that Mr. Beesley's selection of an Acetylated â-Cyclodextrin column or Chiralcel OD column was beyond the common general knowledge as it was. Furthermore, given the great many variables as set out in the evidence of Drs. Armstrong and Myers, it was not obvious that success would have been achieved by the use of an HPLC column.
[216]
The definitions of "obvious" in the Oxford English dictionary, coming from the Latin "
ob via
", or "in the way", include: "lying or standing in the way, plain and open to the eye or mind, clearly perceptible, perfectly evident or manifest; palpable." "Obviousness" is "the state or condition of being exposed or open; the quality of being clearly perceptible."
[217]
In my opinion, an assembly of literature which might, and I emphasize the word "might", have led to (+)-Citalopram involved a considerable degree of inventiveness.
[218]
Upon reflection, the following passage from Dr. Davies' report accurately reflects my own opinion (para 364):
Accordingly, I do not believe that the person skilled in the art would have been successful in producing the individual enantiomers of citalopram in 1988 had he or she decided to attempt it. Much work and experimentation, and perhaps a fair dose of luck, would have been required. Neither the various techniques that could have been used by the skilled person, nor those that actually led to (+)-citalopram were very plain or routine. It was certainly not self-evident that any of these techniques ought to have worked. I believe that the sheer number of possible directions available and the ultimate discovery of an unusual route are clearly indicative of non-obviousness. To reconstruct backwards, using bits and pieces of known concepts, is to fall into the familiar trap of hindsight. [...]
C. Inutility
[219]
Apotex alleges that the Pamoic Addition Salt of (+)-Citalopram is toxic. The
per se
claims 1 through 5 all encompass this salt. Therefore, it follows that the patent falls for inutility.
[220]
The basis of Apotex's allegation is an international application for a patent filed by Lundbeck in 2004, International Publication Number, WO 2004/05671 A One. This application, which was for (+)-Citalopram Hydrobromide and a method for its preparation, states:
This application also describes the freebase of Escitalopram as an oil, the oxalic acid salt, the pamoic acid and the L-"+"-tartaric acid addition salt of Escitalopram. Due to the toxicity of pamoic acid addition salts they are not suitable in pharmaceuticals.
[221]
Apotex submits that this statement is a binding admission. In my opinion, the issue is not what Lundbeck said in 2004, but rather whether or not the Pamoic Salt of (+)-Citalopram is toxic.
[222]
Apotex led no evidence to speak of. Dr. Jenner referred to the 2004 application in his report but admitted he did not know whether or not the Pamoic Salt of (+)-Citalopram was toxic. Somewhat disturbingly, Dr. Hellen Northeved, a toxicologist  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , testified that this salt was never tested by it until the present litigation.
[223]
Lundbeck filed the expert report of Dr. Gerd Bode. His report was taken as read without cross-examination. That report indicates that the salt is not toxic in rats. In addition, Dr. Davies' report indicates that several drugs approved by Health Canada and the FDA contain Pamoic Acid Salts.
[224]
Even if Lundbeck's evidence is not perfect, it is better than Apotex's, which is none at all. As the Supreme Court noted in
Whirlpool
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 9 CPR (4th) 129, [2000] SCJ No 68 (QL)), it is not unreasonable for a court to accept scanty evidence from one side, against no evidence at all from the other. Just about everything is toxic if taken in excess. This allegation is dismissed.
D. Insufficient Disclosure
[225]
The specification discloses that "results upon administration to human beings have been very gratifying". That statement is untrue as the enantiomers had not been tested on human beings until after the patent application was filed in June 1989. As a consequence, Apotex submits, the patent should be declared to be void. Subsection 27(3) of the Act, as it was, provided that "The specification of an invention must (a) correctly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor ..."
[226]
This is to be contrasted with subsection 53(1) which provided that a patent was void "if any material allegation in the petition of the applicant in respect of the patent is untrue [...] and the admission or addition was wilfully made for the purpose of misleading".
[227]
In the PM (NOC) proceedings, Apotex argued both subsections. On reflection, I must say that I conflated them as I said at paragraph 147 that "I do not consider that the one-liner misled anyone. Furthermore, there is no evidence of an effort to mislead."
[228]
In appeal, Mr. Justice Noël stated at paragraphs 117 and 118:
[117] Apotex also argues that the disclosure in the '452 patent is insufficient because it lays a false trail by reason of the following statement (Reasons, para. 147): "[r] esults upon administration to human beings have been very gratifying". The Applications Judge agreed that this statement was false since escitalopram had yet to be administered to human beings at the relevant time. However, he held that (ibidem): "[g] iven that the patent has two full pages of evaluation of escitalopram upon rodents together with a table of pharmacological test results, I do not consider that the one-liner misled anyone. Furthermore, there is no evidence of an effort to mislead". I can see no basis for interfering with this conclusion.
[118] Apotex nevertheless argues that this does not address its contention that the invention was not correctly described and therefore is in breach of section 34 of the Patent Act. In my respectful view, it was open to the Applications Judge to hold that as no one was misled, the invention was correctly described.
[229]
In this action, Apotex is not alleging section 53 but again alleges insufficient disclosure pursuant to section 27. The PM (NOC) proceedings have to be reconsidered in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court last November in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] SCJ No 60 (QL). The Court held that sections 27 and 53 were separate and distinct. Pfizer's patent for Viagra was held void for insufficient disclosure, notwithstanding that in that case, as in this one, section 53 had not been alleged. Nevertheless, the disclosure was incorrect and the patent struck. Apotex asserts I should do the same in this case.
[230]
Certainly, the two experts called by Apotex who dealt with this point were not misled. Dr. Jenner was of the view that a pharmacologist would understand that all the experiments were set out in the '452 patent. Since none of those experiments were conducted on human beings, he took the statement to be one of prediction rather than of fact.
[231]
Dr. Levy was more specific. He was of the view that from the disclosure in the patent, the skilled person would understand the greater potency of the (+)-Citalopram had not been demonstrated but only predicted. He focused on whether the prediction extended to (+)-Citalopram being more potent than Citalopram, a prediction which he said was not sound. I shall deal with his opinion under the topic of Sound Prediction.
[232]
In my opinion, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> has no application to this case. Pfizer claimed 260 quintillion (1018) compounds for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in impotent males. The patent did not disclose that the compound which actually worked was sildenafil and that the remaining compounds had not been found to be effective. This was the needle in a haystack type of case.
[233]
After reviewing the
quid pro quo
aspect of the patent "bargain" and holding that adequate disclosure is a precondition to the granting of a patent, Mr. Justice Lebel held at paragraph 72 that "...the invention was the use of sildenafil for the treatment of ED. This had to be disclosed to order to meet the requirements set out in s. 27(3) of the Act" and at paragraph 76 "Pfizer had the information needed to disclose the useful compound and chose not to release it."
[234]
Even though there were cascading claims which came down to sildenafil being one of two, Mr. Justice Lebel added at paragraph 80:
However, the public's right to proper disclosure was denied in this case, since the claims ended with two individually claimed compounds, thereby obscuring the true invention. The disclosure failed to state in clear terms what the invention was. Pfizer gained a benefit from the Act --exclusive monopoly rights-- while withholding disclosure in spite of its disclosure obligations under the Act. As a matter of policy and sound statutory interpretation, patentees cannot be allowed to "game" the system in this way. This, in my view, is the key issue in this appeal. It must be resolved against Pfizer.
He declared the patent void, notwithstanding that the appeal was in a PM (NOC) application. It had been assumed that the only issue in such applications was whether the Minister of Health should be prohibited from issuing a Notice of Compliance. Pfizer has applied to the Supreme Court for reconsideration.
[235]
In this case, the invention, (+)-Citalopram and how to get there, was properly disclosed. In fact, notwithstanding its disclosure (-)-Citalopram was not claimed. It seems to me that the answer lies in the construction of the patent. As taught in such cases as
Free World Trust
, above, construction is to be purposive and informed. One task is to separate the essential from the non-essential. Although a patent is to be read with the assistance of the skilled addressee (
Whirlpool
, at para 45), nevertheless a patent meets the definition of a "regulation" in the
Interpretation Act
and must be read to ensure the attainment of its objects. As mentioned earlier, "claims construction is a matter of law for the judge, and he was quite entitled to adopt a construction of the claims that differed from that put forward by the parties." (
Whirlpool
, at para 61).
[236]
Although the Court needs the assistance of the skilled addressee to gain some understanding of racemates and enantiomers, and to understand what Citalopram actually is, there is a limit to the assistance required.
[237]
The sentence: "Results upon administration to human beings have been very gratifying." is not a technical one. I have no hesitation in holding that the sentence was not essential, so that the patent survives. In any event, if I do need assistance, neither Dr. Jenner nor Dr. Levy read the patent as meaning that tests of the enantiomers upon human beings actually had been conducted.
[238]
Depending on the outcome of Pfizer's application to the Supreme Court for reconsideration of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it may well be that it is not even open to Apotex to argue this particular point. Following <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 81, [2012] FCJ No 1426 (QL), an impeachment action relating to the same Viagra patent, Mr. Justice Zinn granted Apotex's motion for summary judgment based on the Supreme Court's decision. His decision is under appeal. Patent construction is a matter of law, so that it might well be that Apotex is bound by the construction I gave to the '452 patent, upheld by the Court of Appeal.
Claim 7 of the Patent
[239]
The other insufficient disclosure allegation relates to claim 7 of the patent which reads:
A method for the preparation of (+)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, which comprises the step of resolving the two enantiomers of a compound having the general formula
[diagram omitted]
wherein R' is hydrogen or a labile ester group, thereby obtaining the enantiomer giving (+)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, which enantiomer subsequently is cyclized by treatment with base or, if R' is hydrogen, with base in the presence of an acid derivative which is productive of a labile ester, and then isolating (+)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzo-furan-5-carbonitrile as such or as a non-toxic acid addition salt thereof.
[240]
Apotex alleges that the process of claim 7 does not specifically teach which of the resolved enantiomers produces (+)-Citalopram, or the procedural steps for obtaining the enantiomer that produces (+)-Citalopram. It submits that Lundbeck is hoisted by its own petard. If claim 7 requires some testing to make it work, then the same testing would have allowed the skilled addressee to arrive at (+)-Citalopram in the first place. However, in my opinion, there is an important difference between testing done armed with the patent, or without. As noted by Dr. Davies, one of the enantiomers giving (+)-Citalopram is used for the rest of the method described. A skilled person would know that the ester could be the (+) or (-). I hold that claim 7 does not fall for insufficient disclosure.
E. Sound Prediction
[241]
Sound prediction that something would work, as opposed to an actual demonstration, was dealt with in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  prediction;
ii. the inventor must have had at the time of the application an articulable (and sound) line of reasoning from which the desired result could be inferred from the factual basis; and
iii. there must be proper disclosure (para 70).
[242]
Lundbeck had a sound basis for predicting that (+)-Citalopram would be useful in the treatment of depression in humans. The racemate had already proved useful, and the same type of
in vivo
and
in vitro
tests to which Citalopram had been subjected were run on (+)-Citalopram. They indicated that (+)-Citalopram had a greater potency than Citalopram itself.
[243]
However, Apotex submits that Lundbeck promised in the disclosure that (+)-Citalopram had greater therapeutic effect than Citalopram. This promise could only be demonstrated by testing upon humans, and so the patent falls unless there was a sound basis for making it. I agree that if such a promise was made it was not based on a sound prediction. However, the real question is whether Lundbeck made such a promise. I find that it did not.
[244]
Apotex infers this promise from a statement in the disclosure that "almost the entire 5-HT uptake inhibition resided in the (+)-Citalopram enantiomer" and from a table showing pharmacological test results
in vivo
and
in vitro
on rats and mice. The table shows:
[diagram omitted]
The lower the number the better. The table indicates that (+)-Citalopram is far more potent, some 60 times more than (-)-Citalopram and about 1.6 times more than Citalopram itself.
[245]
However, the experts on this point, including Dr. Blier by the time his cross-examination was over, agree that tests on rodents do not serve as an appropriate factual basis to predict that (+)-Citalopram had greater therapeutic effect than Citalopram. The differences between the species are just too great.
[246]
I accept Dr. Jenner's view that as of April 1988, a pharmacologist would expect that both enantiomers of Citalopram would have some activity as anti-depressant compounds in humans and would also expect that one of the enantiomers would be more potent than the other. He did not explain, however, the basis of his view that the patent promised that (+)-Citalopram was more potent in humans than the racemate. Dr. Levy, also called by Apotex, a most impressive witness, was of the view that the '452 patent was addressed to pharmacologists, chemists and medical doctors with an interest in treating depression. He thought that this skilled person would understand the '452 patent to promise that (+)-Citalopram would be a more potent anti-depressant in humans than racemic Citalopram. That greater potency, however, was not demonstrated and there was no factual basis and no line of reasoning disclosed which would allow the inventors to make that prediction.
[247]
I accept without hesitation his evidence, including his primer in pharmacology and metabolism, bioavailabity, and interspecies differences in metabolism, and that there was no appropriate basis for predicting that (+)-Citalopram was better than Citalopram in the treatment of depression in humans, notwithstanding that later on that proved to be true.
[248]
He noted that the patent stated that (+)-Citalopram had almost all the 5-HT reuptake inhibitory activity. He went on to say: "The pharmacologist would understand from this statement that (+)-Citalopram will have almost all the 5-HT reuptake inhibitory activity of Citalopram in humans", and by inference that (-)-Citalopram will have relatively little 5-HT reuptake inhibitory activity in humans. I agree with that reasoning.
[249]
However, he continued: "The pharmacologist would understand that the '452 Patent was promising that (+)-Citalopram will be a more potent antidepressant than citalopram in humans."
[250]
Dr. Blier, called by Lundbeck, was of the view that patent '452 promised that (+)-Citalopram would be useful in the treatment of depression but did not promise a specific comparative result.
[251]
Apotex submits that the evidence of Dr. Jenner and Dr. Levy should be preferred. Although Dr. Blier disclosed that he had done work for Lundbeck, he had not disclosed that he had also done work for Forest Laboratories who marketed (+)-Citalopram in the United States. He also had a bias against generics. I disagree with this latter point. He disagrees with some of the bioequivalent standards of Health Canada. He is not against generics as such.
[252]
Again, as stated by Mr. Justice Binnie in
Whirlpool
, above, at paragraph 61: "claims construction is a matter of law for the judge, and he was quite entitled to adopt a construction of the claims that differed from that put forward by the parties".
[253]
Although the Court needs advice from experts with respect to the chemistry of the patent, the common general knowledge and the attributes of the skilled addressee, there is nothing scientific about the points in dispute. Dr. Jenner and Dr. Levy do not explain why the skilled addressee of the patent would infer a promise that (+)-Citalopram was better. There is no explicit statement either in the disclosure or in the claims. The claim portion of the specification takes precedence over the disclosure portion in that the disclosure is read so as to understand what is meant by the claims "but not to enlarge or contract the scope of the claims as written and thus understood" (
Whirlpool
, above, at paragraph 52). To overclaim is to lose everything. The table illustrated that most of the inhibition was found in the (+) enantiomer. The insertion of Citalopram as a point of reference cannot be taken as a promise. These was no prediction that (+)-Citalopram was better than Citalopram.
[254]
To summarize, patent '452 is valid. The inventive concept was the two enantiomers of Citalopram, and methods to get there. As stated by counsel for Lundbeck, the first one who invents a route to the treasure is also entitled to the treasure. Before Lundbeck's work, the enantiomers did not exist separate and distinct from the racemate. The state of the art did not disclose how to arrive at the enantiomers. Their qualities were not known. The steps taken by Lundbeck were not obvious to the person skilled in the art, and also required a degree of inventiveness.
VII.
INFRINGEMENT
[255]
Having found the patent and each and every one of its claims to be valid, I now deal with the infringement by both Apotex and Apotex Pharmachem. Both admitted that in the event the patent was found to be valid in all respects they have infringed.
[256]
In terms of remedy, rather than seeking compensatory damages, Lundbeck has elected for an accounting of profits. Based on Apotex's behaviour it also seeks punitive damages. As is usual in an infringement action, it also seeks delivery-up or destruction of the infringing material still on hand, a permanent injunction until the expiry of patent '452, interest and costs. I shall first deal with punitive damages.
A. Punitive Damages
[257]
An election for an accounting of profits, rather than for compensatory damages, does not preclude the Court from awarding punitive damages (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2012] SCJ No 8 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2010] SCJ No 51 (QL)). Punitive or exemplary damages may be awarded in a patent infringement case (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 87, [2012] FCJ No 107 (QL), currently in appeal).
[258]
The Court must consider whether a party's conduct has been malicious, oppressive and offensive to the Court's sense of decency or represents a marked departure from the ordinary standard of decent behaviour (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2002] SCJ No 19 (QL);
Microsoft Corporation v 9038-3746 Quebec Inc
, 2006 FC 1509, 57 CPR (4th) 204, [2006] FCJ No 1965 (QL)).
[259]
The evidence is that Apotex stockpiled (+)-Citalopram in the expectation that the Minister would not be prohibited from issuing a notice of compliance. Its prediction was wrong, both in first instance and in appeal.
[260]
Thereafter, as it was prohibited from marketing (+)-Citalopram in Canada, it sold some of the product to affiliates in the Czech Republic and Australia.
[261]
Dr. Bernard Sherman, Chief Executive Officer of Apotex, testified that as a business decision sometimes Apotex stockpiled in anticipation of a favourable outcome in the PM (NOC) proceedings so as to get on to the market at soon as possible. At times this business strategy works, at other times, as in the present case, it backfires.
[262]
I do not consider Apotex's behaviour such that it would be appropriate to award punitive damages.
[263]
Dr. Sherman testified that once he found out the stockpiled product was being sold overseas, he immediately put a stop to it. Apotex led no evidence as to what safeguards, if any, it had in place to prevent such sales. In any event, the infringement began with the stockpiling, not with the sales overseas.
[264]
Were it not for the PM (NOC) Regulations and the mirror Food and Drug Regulations, presumably Apotex's generic version would have been found by Health Canada to be safe and efficacious and Apotex could have gone on to the Canadian market. The question would then have arisen whether Lundbeck could have obtained an interlocutory injunction. This would have been unlikely as damages would be a suitable remedy.
[265]
Apotex's behaviour does not compare to that set forth by Mr. Justice Martineau in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, above, in which he had found that Bell Helicopter had claimed Eurocopter's invention as its own.
[266]
Lundbeck also asserts a cavalier attitude on the part of Apotex in earlier pleadings in which it specifically denied that if the patent were valid it had infringed. This may be a question of interpreting the pleadings, which are somewhat ambiguous, and there may have been a breakdown in communication between counsel and client. In any event, it would be more appropriate to deal with this issue as a matter of costs, which the parties have agreed should be deferred.
B. Accounting of Profits
[267]
As with all equitable remedies, the trial judge has discretion, judicially exercised, to decide whether or not to grant this relief. Apotex submits that this remedy should not be granted in this case. It says that Lundbeck is not entitled to Apotex's profits from the foreign sales of (+)-Citalopram and that Lundbeck would be given an inequitable windfall were it to claim Apotex's profit on the Australian and Czech Republic sales, as it led no evidence that it had competed in those markets.
[268]
Furthermore, Apotex, according to Dr. Sherman, had acted in good faith that it considered the '452 patent to be invalid, and that at first he was unaware that (+)-Citalopram was being shipped to Apotex affiliates in Australia and the Czech Republic for sale. When he learned about it, he put a stop to it.
[269]
Lundbeck counters that this equitable remedy is contemplated by s 57(1)(b) of the
Patent Act,
and that although the Court is not bound by an election made by a party, the remedy is regularly awarded.
[270]
The election is ordinarily accepted unless there are circumstances which would warrant withholding it from the successful party (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), affirmed (1996), 70 CPR (3d) 183 (FCA), [1996] FCJ No 1385 (QL)). In my opinion, there are no circumstances which should deprive Lundbeck of its election. As pointed out by Mr. Justice Addy in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL):
It is most important to remember that the principles governing the awarding of damages to the owner of a patent, which is the remedy ordinarily chosen and which is of course strictly a legal one, must of necessity be quite different from those involved in applying the purely equitable remedy of requiring a wrongdoer to account for all profits derived from his illegal act. In the latter case, the position of the successful plaintiff in so far as any harm or damage he might or might not have suffered is completely irrelevant and, therefore, must not be taken into consideration.
[271]
Consequently, the fact that Lundbeck led no evidence as to its position in the Australian and Czech Republic markets is irrelevant. It may be that Lundbeck suffered little or no damage in those markets. The fact is, however, that Apotex made a profit and must account for it.
[272]
Furthermore, good faith on the defendants by counterclaim's part is not relevant either. They are not being punished. They made use of Lundbeck's intellectual property rights and must turn over the profits they made. It would be completely unreasonable to hold that the only consequence of infringement over several years would be to declare the patent valid and to enjoin them from continuing what they should not have done in the first place.
C. The Profits
[273]
The concept is clear. Apotex and Apotex Pharmachem must account for the revenues generated by the sale of (+)-Citalopram. They are entitled to deduct therefrom expenses reasonably incurred in generating that revenue. The balance goes to Lundbeck. As so often happens, the devil is in the detail.
[274]
From 2005 through to 2010, Apotex purchased (+)-Citalopram Oxalate from two sources in
[Redacted
], and then a small quantity from Apotex Pharmachem.
[275]
Apotex Inc. purchased a total of
[Redacted
] of (+)-Citalopram Oxalate, all but
[Redacted
] thereof from the two
[Redacted
] companies. There is no evidence that these companies were corporately related to Apotex.
[Redacted
] had been returned to one of the
[Redacted
] vendors. The parties have agreed that the following quantities of (+)-Citalopram or (+)-Citalopram Oxalate are subject to the experimental use exemption provided under section 55.2 of the Act:
i. 48.919 kg for R&D usage and reserve bulk;
ii. 0.53 kg for reserve and retained good samples; and
iii. 2.59 kg of in-process finished goods samples.
[276]
Apotex admits to a profit of $969,072.94 based on sales of
[Redacted
].
[277]
Apotex Pharmachem Inc. admits to a profit of $33,568 based on one sale of
[Redacted
].
[278]
Lundbeck submits that the price of the (+)-Citalopram sold by Apotex its Australian affiliate should have been much higher. It also disputes some of the expenses claimed by both Apotex and Apotex Pharmachem.
[279]
The Court heard expert evidence from two chartered accountants, Pierre St-Laurent, called by Lundbeck, and Howard Rosen, called by Apotex. Both are experienced forensic chartered accountants and were qualified to assist the Court. There are two caveats to that remark. The first caveat is that both attempted to give an accounting effect to jurisprudence. It is up to the Court to decide what those cases mean.
[280]
The second caveat is that Lundbeck pointed out that Mr. Rosen's firm has acted as Apotex's external accountants for many years, and that he has, himself, been called as an expert witness by Apotex on many occasions. This approach was hardly surprising given the treatment of Dr. Davies, and was somewhat mild in comparison. Nevertheless, there may be some justification  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's position in that Mr. Rosen accepted that certain expenses were actually incurred although invoices could not be produced.
[281]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2004] SCJ No 29 (QL), Chief Justice McLachlin and Mr. Justice Fish, speaking for the majority, stated at paragraphs 100 and following that the accounting of profit remedy was based on "differential profits" and referred to an article by Professor Norman Siebrasse entitled "A Remedial Benefit-Based Approach to the Innocent-User Problem in the Patenting of Higher Life Forms" (2004), 20 C.I.P.R. 79. Professor Siebrasse was of the view that Canadian jurisprudence was somewhat inconsistent. He opined that the "differential profit" approach was clearly stated by the United States Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1871) at page 651:
The question to be determined in this case is, what advantage did the defendant derive from using the complainant's invention over what he had in using other processes then opened to the public and adequate to enable him to obtain an equally beneficial result.
[282]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court held that having elected for an accounting of profits, the plaintiff could not claim damages. Schmeiser had made no profit in the use of a patent relating to Canola in that he could have reached the same result without recourse to it.
[283]
This case is quite different. The only active ingredient in the Apotex product was (+)-Citalopram and so it must turn over all profit less legitimate expenses incurred.
[284]
I will deal first with revenues and then expenses.
[285]
The principal factual witness with respect to Apotex's sales to the Czech Republic and to Australia was Gordon Fahner, its Vice-President, Business Operations and Finance. He explained that the company's accounting system is based on ERP software (Enterprise, Resource, Planning System). After expenses are actually incurred, variations between budget and reality are entered. The system has been in place since 2001 and is remarkably accurate.
[286]
Transfer pricing to overseas affiliates depends to some extent on the regulatory regime in place. In the Czech Republic, the importer must wholesale the goods at the same price at which they were imported. This leaves no room for the expenses incurred by the Czech affiliate. That company was compensated out of Canada by an Apotex company. However, no deduction has been claimed and so no credit can be given. Lundbeck accepts that the sales to the Czech Republic totalled
[Redacted
] and does not challenge the reasonableness of that figure.
[287]
The Australian market was quite different. The selling price was lower. Apotex had always been wary of the position Canadian tax authorities might take with respect to transfer pricing between corporations not dealing at arms-length. See for example the recent decision of the Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] SCJ No 52 (QL). A profit margin of
[Redacted
] over and above the C.I.F. selling price was considered acceptable. However, for reasons he could not quite explain, Apotex's profit of
[Redacted
] was just over
[Redacted
].
[288]
Lundbeck's counsel, however, suggests that the selling price should have been either in excess of $10,000,000 or close to $13,000,000. These scenarios are based on theories that Apotex could have sold in Australia at the same price as to the Czech Republic and that it, in fact, is "parking" profits overseas. Dr. Sherman testified that no money has come back to Canada indirectly by way of dividends or otherwise. Had Apotex reorganized its affairs to avoid a proper accounting, Lundbeck may have had a point. However, these business relationships were in place for some time, and were not designed to thwart Lundbeck. A fact scenario much closer to the point is
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL). In that case, as part of a refinancing, a ship was sold and then bareboat chartered back to the original owner. This had the effect of defeating a portion of the plaintiff's action
in rem
. Nevertheless, the Court held that as no bad faith was involved, the plaintiff, a ship repairer, had lost that recourse.
[289]
Apotex Pharmachem had only one sale, which was to Apotex itself. It was in the amount of Canadian
[Redacted
], which works out to Canadian
[Redacted
] per kilo. The sales price was not contested, but the expenses it claimed were.
[290]
The experts had quite a different approach to the expenses which could properly be deducted. To deal first with Apotex itself, it claimed its cost of sales as follows:
Sales
Cost of Sales
Material
Packaging Material
Material variance
Direct Labour
Set/Cleanup Labour
Direct Overhead
Direct Quality Assurance
[REDACTED]
Indirect Overhead
Indirect Quality Assurance
Fixed Overhead
Depreciation
Rent
Sub-Total
Rounding differences
Total
Profit
Quantities sold (kg)
[291]
Mr. St-Laurent agreed with the cost of material but would only allow
[Redacted
] with respect with the Australian packaging as supporting invoices were not produced. He would allow no deduction with respect to sales to either country for direct labour, set/clean-up labour, direct overheard, direct quality assurance, indirect overhead, indirect quality assurance, fixed overhead, depreciation and rent.
[292]
Mr. Rosen would allow all these expenses as claimed by Apotex.
[293]
Mr. St-Laurent's view was that these costs, fixed and variable, direct and indirect, would have been incurred in any event. The employees were not paid on a piecework basis. They would have been paid whether (+)-Citalopram was manufactured or not. In his report, he refers to the expert evidence he gave in this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL). One of the problems was that sales were of an entire machine, only part of which infringed. This gave rise to apportionment issues. In speaking of an accounting of profits, Mr. Justice Rouleau said at para 70: "The objective of the award is to restore those actual profits to their rightful owner, the plaintiff, thereby eliminating whatever unjust enrichment has been procured by the defendant."
[294]
Although Mr. St-Laurent is of the view that his accounting concepts were accepted for the most part, Mr. Justice Rouleau held he was unable to conclude that any of the profit realized by the infringer was derived as a result of the infringement of Beloit's patent. Therefore he said at para 79: "It is for this reason that I have not referred in detail to the evidence of the accounting experts called for both sides. Although I have not discounted their evidence, it simply has little relevance to the issue now before me." The appeal was allowed in part, 94 FTR 102, 61 CPR (3d) 271, [1995] FCJ No 733 (QL), but did not touch upon Mr. Justice Rouleau's appreciation of the evidence regarding the profits on non-infringing parts of the machine.
[295]
I do not see any underlying philosophy in that case which might be helpful.
[296]
Mr. Rosen also relies on his courtroom experience. His preference as an accountant is for a full absorption method by which the entire costs of an enterprise are proportionately spread out against the manufactured products. However, that view was not fully accepted by Mr. Justice MacKay in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL). This was another case in which there was both infringing and non-infringing material involved in the infringer's sales. He favourably referred to the differential cost accounting, or incremental approach, method dealt with by the Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), by which net revenues are calculated by deducting variable and fixed costs which contributed to the revenue. No part or portion of any expenditure which would have been incurred had the infringing activity not taken place is to be considered deductible. After referring to the paucity of evidence and limiting himself to the circumstances of the case, he allowed the following expenses: a) the cost of material; b) an allocation of Apotex's annual labour and factory overhead based on the proportion of units of the infringing product to the total production of all products; c) similarly an allocation of the annual cost of selling; and d) other items subject to agreement. This is another case which is not to be followed "au pied de la lettre".
[297]
Coming to the individual items in dispute, like Mr. St-Laurent, I would only allow
[Redacted
] of the
[Redacted
] for the cost of packaging material relating to the Australian exports. The burden was on Apotex, and it was unable to produce anything to evidence those costs. Mr. Rosen accepted the cost because the variances after expense incurred were otherwise very minor, as shown above. It was logical to assume that the expenses were incurred. That may well be so, but it is not established that this is an accounting principle. Whether it be inference or speculation, it is for the Court to decide. In my view, the cost of packaging, without supporting material, falls into the realm of speculation. As stated by Lord MacMillan in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 45:
The dividing line between conjecture and inference is often a very difficult one to draw. A conjecture may be plausible but it is of no legal value, for its essence is that it is a mere guess. An inference in the legal sense, on the other hand, is a deduction from the evidence and if it is a reasonable deduction it may have the validity of legal proof.
See also
Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL).
[298]
I have no difficulty allowing the direct labour, set/clean-up labour, direct overhead and direct quality assurance. These figures were not challenged. What was challenged was whether they should be deductible in an accounting of profits before the Court.
[299]
Apart from the decision of Mr. Justice MacKay, it is well established that, without precise proof, a plaintiff who uses its own labour to repair damage caused by a defendant cannot make a profit but nevertheless is entitled to charge the cost of labour, including direct overhead on the basis that otherwise those employees would have been doing something else productive. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 196, [2011] FCJ No 602 (QL) at paragraph 56, and authorities cited therein. The appeal, which maintained the decision, 2012 FCA 199, 433 NR 152, [2012] FCJ No 855 (QL), did not deal with this issue. The Supreme Court has granted leave to appeal.)
[300]
However, I am not prepared to allow indirect overhead, indirect quality assurance, fixed overhead, depreciation and rent. This appears to me to be very close to a full absorption method. In the decision of Mr. Justice MacKay, no breakdown was given between direct and indirect overhead, as has been done in this case. I am guided by the decision of Associate Chief Justice Thurlow in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL). That was a breach of a contract of affreightment case. The damages sought were the profits which would have been earned had the contract been performed. Damages were to be ascertained by calculation of the freight which would have been earned less the expenses to which the carrier would have been put in earning it, also taking into account mitigation of damages. The plaintiff's calculations were akin to what accountants would call a full absorption method in that its calculations included crew wages, insurance, maintenance, lubricants, and depreciation. The defendant only brought in as deductions items referable to earning the particular freight, such as loading and discharging expenses, bunkers and port expenses, the theory being that the other expenses were those which a shipowner had to bear regardless of any particular voyage. Associate Chief Justice Thurlow leaned more to the defendant, but differed somewhat from both.
[301]
It seems to me that indirect overhead, indirect quality assurance, fixed overhead depreciation and rent are too remote to be referable to the manufacture of (+)-Citalopram and so I disallow them.
[302]
In the result, I fix Apotex's profit at $1,410,906.21 based on sales of
[Redacted
] less expenses of
[Redacted
] (
[Redacted
] for material,
[Redacted
] for packaging,
[Redacted
] for direct labour,
[Redacted
] for set/cleanup labour,
[Redacted
] for direct overhead and
[Redacted
] for direct quality assurance).
[303]
As for Apotex Pharmachem, Mr. St-Laurent is of the view that the expenses claimed are far too high. However, this was the first time it had manufactured (+)-Citalopram. The cost of the first item off the assembly line is always more expensive than if the set-up cost had been spread out over a much greater production. Of the
[Redacted
] of expenses claimed, he would allow only
[Redacted
]. Basing myself on the same principles I applied to Apotex, I would only disallow Apotex Pharmachem's indirect fixed overhead of
[Redacted
] as calculated by Mr. Rosen.
[304]
Consequently, Apotex Pharmachem has to turn over profits of $304,177.38 based on its one sale of
[Redacted
] less expenses of
[Redacted
].
D. Delivery-Up or Destruction
[305]
Section 57 of the
Patent Act
, both then and now, contemplates that the Court may make such orders as it sees fit enjoining a party, and generally respecting the proceedings. It is common ground that delivery-up or destruction of the infringing product is a remedy which the Court may order. In this case, Apotex still has in its possession 8.34 kilos of (+)-Citalopram. For its part, Apotex took the position that if it were found to have infringed, it should be able to work out an appropriate protocol with Lundbeck. This is a sensible suggestion, and so I leave it to the parties to work out the parameters.
E. Permanent Injunction
[306]
Lundbeck is entitled to an order prohibiting the defendants, directly or indirectly, as well as their officers and directors, and the servants, employees or agents of any of them, and any other person, corporation or entity acting under their instructions or control, from making, selling, distributing, advertising, exposing for sale, offering for sale, stockpiling or possessing for the purposes of the foregoing or importing into Canada (+)-Citalopram prior to the expiration of patent 1,339,452 on 9 September 2014.
F. Interest
[307]
The granting of prejudgment and post-judgment interest is governed by sections 36 and 37 of the
Federal Courts Act
. A distinction must be drawn between causes of action arising within a province, and causes of action arising outside a province or in more than one province. Lundbeck submits that the cause of action arose in Ontario, and Apotex concurs. Far be it from me to disagree, particularly since the Court, in its discretion, could have ordered a higher rate of interest if the cause of action arose other than in a single province.
[308]
In the circumstances, the
Federal Courts Act
incorporates Ontario law, more particularly sections 127 and following of the
Courts of Justice Act
, RSO 1990, c C43. Prejudgment interest is to be calculated from the date the cause of action arose, at the Bank of Canada's minimum rate on short-term advances to the banks listed in Schedule 1 of the
Bank Act
. Post-judgment interest shall be calculated at that rate plus one percent.
[309]
Although the cause of action arose with stockpiling in contravention of the
Patent Act
, had there been no sales, the remedies would have been limited to an injunction, delivery-up or destruction and costs. No interest would have been awarded. The interest to be awarded is based on the sales. According to Apotex's records, sales began 8 June 2009 and ended 20 August 2010. An approximate midpoint is the only sale in excess of $200,000 which occurred on 23 December 2009. It would be intolerable to have to do interest calculations on each sale. I shall fix the starting point for prejudgment interest on the Apotex sales as 1 January 2010.
[310]
Apotex Pharmachem had only one sale, which was to Apotex itself. The date of that sale was 22 June 2010. That date shall be the starting point on prejudgment interest.
[311]
Notwithstanding that a formal judgment is yet to be entered, post-judgment interest shall run from the date of these reasons.
IX. COSTS
[312]
At the request of the parties, an order or directions relating to costs shall be deferred.
X.
CONFIDENTIALITY
[313]
As much of the evidence and testimony was covered by various confidentiality and sealing orders, the parties shall have ten (10) days from the date of these reasons, hopefully in conjunction with each other, to inform the Court if any portions hereof should be deleted or modified in the public version, and if so to provide suggestions.
[314]
For the sake of good order, all objections raised during trial not otherwise ruled upon are dismissed.
XI.
DRAFTING OF JUDGMENT
[315]
In accordance with rule 394 of the
Federal Courts Rules
, I direct that counsel for Lundbeck prepare for endorsement a draft judgment to give effect to these reasons, approved as to form and content by Apotex. Should the parties be unable to agree, they shall so inform the Court within ten (10) days hereof and Lundbeck shall bring on a motion in writing for judgment in accordance with rule 369 of the
Federal Courts Rules
.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Apotex Pharmachem Inc. (défenderesses reconventionnelles)
[1]
Le juge Harrington
[Traduction]: La présente action en invalidation d'un brevet d'invention et la demande reconventionnelle en contrefaçon portent sur le composé appelé escitalopram ou (+)-citalopram. Ce composé appartient à la classe des ISRS (inhibiteurs sélectifs du recaptage de la sérotonine ou inhibiteurs du recaptage de la 5-HT). Il s'est révélé utile dans le traitement de la dépression clinique. Ce produit est vendu sous le nom de Cipralex au Canada, de Lexapro aux États-Unis et de Cipramil au Royaume-Uni. Il a été inventé au Danemark en 1988 et a été breveté au Canada et dans de nombreux autres pays. Le brevet revendique le (+)-citalopram lui-même, ainsi que des méthodes pour le fabriquer, et ses sels non toxiques.
[2]
Apotex Inc. voulait commercialiser sa version générique du (+)-citalopram depuis un certain temps. Ses projets ont d'abord été contrecarrés par Lundbeck qui a obtenu une ordonnance de la Cour fondée sur le
Règlement sur les médicaments brevetés (avis de conformité)
[Règlement MB (AC)] et interdisant au ministre de la Santé de délivrer un avis de conformité. Cet avis aurait permis à Apotex d'entrer sur le marché. Cependant, l'ordonnance n'était pas censée statuer sur la validité du brevet.
[3]
Dans la présente action, Apotex cherche à obtenir une déclaration portant que le brevet canadien no 1 339 452 (brevet 452) est et a toujours été invalide. De son côté, Lundbeck a introduit une demande reconventionnelle dans le cadre de laquelle elle a soutenu qu'Apotex et une société connexe, Apotex Pharmachem Inc., ont contrefait le brevet. Elle réclame entre autres choses la restitution des profits. Apotex reconnaît avoir contrefait le brevet, pour autant que celui-ci soit valide, en tout ou en partie. Apotex Pharmachem Inc. a produit le (+)-citalopram grâce à une méthode qui n'est pas visée par le brevet. Elle n'aura donc contrefait le brevet que si la revendication de Lundbeck concernant le composé (+)-citalopram est elle-même jugée valide.
[4]
Une invention doit avoir le caractère de la nouveauté. Apotex soutient que le (+)-citalopram n'est pas nouveau et donc que Lundbeck n'a rien inventé du tout. Elle prétend que le (+)-citalopram était antériorisé par les publications précédentes et qu'il était évident pour les personnes à qui le brevet s'adressait.
[5]
Pour être brevetable, une invention doit également être utile. Dans une demande de brevet ultérieure, Lundbeck a indiqué que le sel résultant de l'addition d'acide pamoïque au (+)-citalopram était toxique. Comme ce sel est mentionné dans les revendications relatives au composé lui-même, le brevet serait invalide pour cause d'inutilité.
[6]
Enfin, l'objet doit être brevetable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2002] ACS no 77 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2004] ACS no 29 (QL)). Cependant, cet aspect n'est pas contesté en l'espèce.
[7]
Un brevet est un marché conclu entre l'inventeur et l'État. En échange du monopole qu'il se voit accorder, l'inventeur doit divulguer l'invention de manière adéquate et complète de telle sorte que d'autres puissent reproduire le produit ou le procédé en cause sans difficulté indue lorsque le monopole prend fin. La
Loi sur les brevets
exige que le demandeur fournisse un mémoire descriptif qui divulgue la nature de l'invention et la manière de la reproduire. Le mémoire descriptif se termine par une revendication ou une série de revendications à l'égard desquelles un monopole est demandé. D'après Apotex, le mémoire descriptif présente des vices fatals.
[8]
À ce qu'elle prétend, une des revendications du brevet, la revendication no 7, qui se rapporte à première vue à une méthode ou à un procédé de préparation du (+)-citalopram, n'a pas fait l'objet d'une divulgation suffisante et ne repose pas sur des techniques courantes qui auraient été connues de la personne versée dans l'art en 1988. Les autres réclamations liées au procédé sont également invalides, car elles dépendent de la revendication no 7.
[9]
D'autre part, le brevet serait inadéquat, car il indique que [traduction] « les résultats de l'administration à des êtres humains ont été très satisfaisants ». En fait, au moment de la demande, aucun essai n'avait été effectué chez l'humain; la divulgation de l'invention est par conséquent incomplète.
[10]
Il n'est pas nécessaire que les énoncés ou les promesses figurant dans le mémoire descriptif s'appuient sur une preuve irréfutable. L'énoncé peut reposer sur une prédiction, pour autant qu'il s'agisse d'une prédiction valable. Comme nous le verrons, le (+)-citalopram est un énantiomère du racémate citalopram, lequel, avec d'autres précurseurs, est visé par des brevets antérieurs. En 1988, le citalopram s'était révélé efficace dans le traitement de la dépression. D'après Apotex, le brevet 452 prête au (+)-citalopram une efficacité thérapeutique supérieure à celle du citalopram. Cette prédiction était sans fondement valable puisque le (+)-citalopram n'avait pas encore été testé chez l'humain. Le fait que la prédiction s'est ensuite avérée exacte est sans pertinence.
[11]
Je me propose d'examiner les questions de l'invalidité et de la contrefaçon. Comme je l'ai noté durant le procès, quelle que soit ma conclusion sur la validité, je statuerai sur la contrefaçon. Si je déclarais le brevet invalide et que ma décision était infirmée en appel, l'affaire me serait probablement renvoyée pour que je statue sur la demande reconventionnelle touchant la contrefaçon. Il est donc préférable d'aborder d'un seul coup tous les aspects du litige.

INTERPRÉTATION DES BREVETS
[13]
Le point de départ de toute enquête concernant l'invalidité ou la contrefaçon est le libellé et le sens du brevet dans le contexte de la
Loi sur les brevets
(
Free World Trust c Électro Santé Inc
, 2000 CSC 66, [2000] 2 RCS 1024, 9 CPR (4th) 168, [2000] ACS no 67 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 9 CPR (4th) 129, [2000] ACS no 68 (QL)).
[14]
Les brevets sont une création de la loi, en l'occurrence la
Loi sur les brevets
en vigueur juste avant le 1er octobre 1989.
[15]
L'article 34 de la
Loi sur les brevets
exigeait que la demande de brevet renferme un mémoire descriptif se terminant par une ou plusieurs revendications « définissant distinctement et en des termes explicites l'objet de l'invention dont le demandeur revendique la propriété ou le privilège exclusif ». Le mémoire descriptif doit être rédigé en des termes complets, clairs, concis et exacts « qui permettent à toute personne versée dans l'art ou la science dont relève l'invention, ou dans l'art ou la science qui s'en rapproche le plus, de confectionner, construire, composer ou utiliser l'invention ».
[16]
Les revendications doivent être interprétées de façon éclairée et en fonction de l'objet pour assurer le respect de l'équité et la prévisibilité, et pour cerner les limites du monopole. Une manière d'y parvenir consiste à séparer l'essentiel de ce qui ne l'est pas. Comme le déclarait le juge Binnie dans
Whirlpool
, au paragraphe 45:
L'interprétation téléologique repose donc sur l'identification par la cour, avec l'aide du lecteur versé dans l'art, des mots ou expressions particuliers qui sont utilisés dans les revendications pour décrire ce qui, selon l'inventeur, constituait les éléments « essentiels » de son invention.
[17]
Cependant, en dernière analyse, il ne revient pas au lecteur versé dans l'art de dicter à la Cour le sens du brevet; c'est la Cour qui doit en révéler le sens aux parties. Un brevet n'est pas un document ordinaire. Il s'agit d'un « règlement » au sens de la
Loi d'interprétation
, qui doit être lu de manière à garantir la réalisation de ses objets. « [L] 'interprétation des revendications est une question de droit qu'il appartient au juge de trancher, et celui-ci avait parfaitement le droit de donner aux revendications une interprétation différente de celle préconisée par les parties. » (
Whirlpool
, au paragraphe 61)
[18]
En vertu de l'article 27 de la
Loi sur les brevets
, tel qu'il existait à l'époque, un inventeur ou son représentant juridique pouvait obtenir un brevet relativement à:
[...] une invention qui
a) n'était pas connue ou utilisée par une autre personne avant que lui-même l'ait faite,
b) n'était pas décrite dans quelque brevet ou dans quelque publication imprimée au Canada ou dans tout autre pays plus de deux ans avant la présentation de la pétition ci-après mentionnée, et
c) n'était pas en usage public ou en vente au Canada plus de deux ans avant le dépôt de sa demande au Canada
...an invention that was
(a)
not known or used by any other person before he invented it,
(b)
not described in any patent or in any publication printed in Canada or in any other country more than two years before presentation of the petition hereunder mentioned, and
(c)
not in public use or on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to his application in Canada
[19]
L'article 2 définissait l'invention en ces termes:
[...] Toute réalisation, tout procédé, toute machine, fabrication ou composition de matières, ainsi que tout perfectionnement de l'un d'eux, présentant le caractère de la nouveauté et de l'utilité.
[...] any new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter
II.
LA PERSONNE VERSÉE DANS L'ART
[20]
Selon l'abrégé dans le mémoire descriptif, l'invention porte sur deux nouveaux énantiomères du citalopram et sur leur utilisation comme composés antidépresseurs, de même que sur leur utilisation possible en gériatrie ou dans le traitement de l'obésité et de l'alcoolisme.
[21]
Le citalopram y est présenté comme étant le 1-(3-diméthylaminopropyl)-1,-(4'-fluorophényl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, et sa formule chimique est représentée par un diagramme.
[22]
Il va sans dire que le brevet ne s'adresse pas à la Cour tel qu'elle est présentement constituée. La Cour a besoin que des experts l'aident à en saisir les aspects techniques. Le brevet s'adresse théoriquement à une personne versée dans l'art ou la science dont relève l'invention, et doit recevoir l'interprétation que cette personne lui aurait donnée lorsqu'il a été rendu public pour la première fois, soit en juin 1988. Les parties ont fait appel à un large éventail d'experts pour assister la Cour à ce chapitre. L'identité de la personne fictive versée dans l'art ne soulève pas de grand désaccord. Il s'agit d'un chimiste médicinal, probablement titulaire d'un doctorat, ayant travaillé au moins quelques années dans un laboratoire. La personne versée dans l'art appartenait à une équipe, ou pouvait consulter une telle équipe, constituée notamment de chimistes analytiques rompus aux principes de la chimie organique et aux techniques de l'époque permettant de séparer les mélanges racémiques en deux énantiomères, de même que de pharmacologues, psychiatres et formulateurs de médicaments.
[23]
Nous nous étendrons davantage sur cette personne versée dans l'art lorsqu'il sera question de l'évidence.
III.
INTRODUCTION À LA CHIMIE ORGANIQUE
[24]
Il est ici question de l'élément « carbone », essentiel à la vie humaine. Le carbone est en effet l'élément de base de la chimie organique. Il n'y a pas de désaccord entre les experts concernant les principes fondamentaux en cause.
[25]
Selon l'opinion de M. Martin Semmelhack, professeur de chimie à l'Université Princeton, appelé à témoigner par Apotex, la chimie organique concerne l'étude de molécules contenant des atomes de carbone. Les molécules sont constituées d'un assemblage d'atomes enchaînés dans un ordre précis. Les atomes de carbone peuvent former des liaisons avec d'autres atomes de carbone et d'autres atomes. Ces liaisons peuvent prendre la forme de longues chaînes ou de structures cycliques. Ces molécules sont tridimensionnelles.
[26]
Les atomes se lient les uns aux autres de diverses manières. Les liaisons covalentes existent entre les atomes qui mettent en commun des électrons, tandis que les liaisons ioniques (fréquentes dans les sels) se forment entre des ions chargés.
[27]
Sous l'angle de la stéréochimie, les isomères sont des molécules qui ont la même formule moléculaire, mais qui diffèrent par l'enchaînement des atomes (isomères de constitution), ou qui ont le même enchaînement des atomes, mais diffèrent par l'agencement spatial de leurs atomes (stéréoisomères).
[28]
Les stéréoisomères sont des molécules qui ont une composition atomique identique, possèdent les mêmes liaisons chimiques, mais dont l'organisation spatiale des atomes est différente. On distingue deux catégories de stéréoisomères: les énantiomères et les diastéréoisomères. Les énantiomères sont des images spéculaires l'une de l'autre, non superposables. Le terme « chiral » (du mot grec signifiant main) est souvent utilisé parce que la main gauche d'une personne est l'image spéculaire de la main droite et vice versa, et qu'on ne peut pas superposer les deux mains. Les diastéréoisomères sont des stéréoisomères qui ne sont pas des énantiomères.
[29]
Les énantiomères ont les mêmes caractéristiques physiques et chimiques (point d'ébullition, point de fusion et solubilité).
[30]
Étant donné que les enzymes et les récepteurs protéiques présents dans l'organisme ont une structure chirale, ils peuvent réagir différemment avec l'un ou l'autre énantiomère du même composé.
[31]
Lorsque des substances naturelles sont recréées en laboratoire, le résultat obtenu est souvent un mélange de deux énantiomères en proportion égale (50/50). Ce mélange est dit « mélange racémique ». On peut distinguer les deux énantiomères selon qu'ils provoquent une rotation du plan de lumière polarisée vers la droite, énantiomère (+), ou vers la gauche, énantiomère (-). On peut également les distinguer en fonction de la taille des atomes fixés au centre carboné, conformément à ce que l'on appelle les règles de Cahn-Ingold-Prelog. Dans une molécule ayant un seul centre stéréogène, un énantiomère sera appelé énantiomère S, et l'autre, énantiomère R. Il n'y a pas de corrélation directe entre les nomenclatures (+) et (-), et R et S. Le citalopram est S et (+).
[32]
Étant donné que les énantiomères présentent des caractéristiques physiques et chimiques identiques, il peut s'avérer difficile, voire impossible, de les distinguer. Toutefois, contrairement aux énantiomères, les diastéréoisomères ont des propriétés chimiques et physiques différentes; ainsi, leur solubilité et leur point de fusion diffèrent. Cette différence a une influence déterminante sur les techniques pouvant être utilisées pour dédoubler un mélange racémique dans le but d'isoler les énantiomères. Il s'agit là de l'un des principaux défis en l'espèce.
[33]
Tous conviennent qu'il faisait partie des connaissances générales courantes, en 1988, que les racémiques pouvaient facilement être identifiés par leur structure chimique et qu'il pouvait fort bien exister des différences entre les deux énantiomères ainsi qu'entre chacun des énantiomères et le racémique. Dans le domaine médical, il faisait également partie des connaissances générales courantes qu'un énantiomère pouvait mieux réagir qu'un autre aux enzymes et aux récepteurs protéiques présents dans l'organisme et, par conséquent, avoir davantage d'effet thérapeutique qu'un autre. Il se pouvait même que l'autre énantiomère ait davantage d'effets secondaires fâcheux. Cela étant dit, la connaissance des caractéristiques des énantiomères ne pouvait être obtenue que par le dédoublement du mélange racémique en quantité suffisante pour permettre les analyses.

LES EXPERTS
[34]
Dans le cadre de son action en invalidation, Apotex a appelé MM. Martin F. Semmelhack, Rick Lane Dannheiser, Peter Jenner, Thomas Beesley, John Caldwell et René Levy. Les témoins factuels d'Apotex étaient également des experts à part entière. Sauf ordonnance à l'effet contraire, les parties ont droit à cinq experts. Cependant, j'ai ordonné, sous réserve de leur consentement, que les deux parties soient autorisées à appeler plus de cinq témoins experts.
[35]
De son côté, Lundbeck a appelé MM. Stephen Graham Davies, Daniel Wayne Armstrong et Peter Myers ainsi que les Drs Pierre Blier et Gerd Bode. Ces témoins factuels étaient également des experts à part entière.
[36]
En réponse au témoignage de M. Davies, Apotex a appelé Sir Jack Baldwin et rappelé M. Dannheiser.
[37]
Chaque partie a appelé un témoin expert relativement au calcul des profits liés à l'éventuelle contrefaçon.
M. Martin Semmelhack
[38]
M. Semmelhack occupe actuellement le poste de directeur adjoint du département de chimie à l'Université Princeton. Les premières études qu'il a menées de manière indépendante à la fin des années 1960, à l'Université Cornell, portaient sur la synthèse organique. Chimiste organicien, il a de solides connaissances dans le domaine de la stéréochimie, des mélanges racémiques et des énantiomères. Depuis les années 1970, il enseigne des notions telles que le dédoublement des mélanges racémiques et l'incidence de la stéréochimie sur les systèmes biologiques. Il jouit de la considération du milieu universitaire et est un auteur reconnu. Sa carrière s'est essentiellement déroulée dans le milieu universitaire, sauf en 1988 et 1989, années où il a occupé les postes de chef du département de chimie médicale puis de directeur-conseil à la division de la recherche médicale d'American Cyanamid. Il a été reconnu comme expert en chimie organique et en synthèse organique. Son témoignage est axé sur les moyens qui pourraient être utilisés pour séparer le citalopram, ou un précurseur de ce dernier, en ses deux énantiomères, à la lumière des connaissances générales courantes, de la littérature et des techniques facilement disponibles pour le destinataire du brevet 452 en 1988.
M. Rick Lane Dannheiser
[39]
M. Dannheiser a obtenu un doctorat en chimie organique à l'Université Harvard en 1978. La même année, il s'est joint au Massachusetts Institute of Technology, où il occupe le poste de professeur de chimie Arthur C. Cope. Son laboratoire s'emploie actuellement à mettre au point de nouvelles stratégies pour la synthèse de molécules complexes. Il est l'auteur de nombreux articles et est un expert reconnu en chimie organique et en chimie organique de synthèse. Comme M. Semmelhack, son témoignage portait sur les moyens d'obtenir le (+)-citalopram, sans avoir recours au brevet 452.
M. Thomas Beesley
[40]
M. Beesley est titulaire d'une maîtrise ès sciences de l'Université de St. John. Il a fait carrière dans l'industrie. Il a été au premier rang de la mise au point de certains des outils analytiques pour la séparation des mélanges racémiques, notamment la chromatographie liquide haute performance (CLHP), qui était une technologie de pointe dans les années 1980. En 1983, il a rencontré M. Armstrong, appelé à témoigner par Lundbeck. M. Armstrong donnait des conférences dans lesquelles il faisait la promotion de molécules, les cyclodextrines, susceptibles de faciliter la séparation de divers isomères. Dans ce dessein, les deux hommes se sont associés pour créer la société Advanced Separation Technologies Inc (Astec). M. Beesly est un expert reconnu dans le domaine de la chromatographie, l'une des techniques disponibles pour séparer des mélanges racémiques, et, en particulier, de l'utilisation de la CLHP chirale.
M. Peter Jenner
[41]
M. Jenner est professeur émérite en pharmacologie au King's College de Londres. Après une formation initiale de pharmacien, il a obtenu un doctorat à l'Université de Londres dans le domaine du métabolisme des médicaments et de la pharmacocinétique. Tout au long de sa carrière, il a collaboré avec des chimistes médicaux, des neurologues cliniciens et des psychiatres. Il est un expert reconnu dans les domaines de la pharmacologie, du métabolisme des médicaments et de la pharmacocinétique, plus particulièrement en ce qui concerne les médicaments agissant sur le système nerveux central utilisés dans le traitement des troubles psychiatriques et neurologiques. Son témoignage ne porte pas sur les moyens de séparer les mélanges racémiques, mais plutôt sur les raisons de les séparer. Autrement dit, il s'intéresse aux facteurs qui pourraient avoir incité, à l'époque, le destinataire versé dans l'art à obtenir le (+)-citalopram.
M. John Caldwell
[42]
M. Caldwell a été doyen de la faculté de médecine de l'Université de Liverpool de 2002 à 2010 et pro-vice-recteur à cette même université de 2007 jusqu'à sa retraite (l'année dernière). Il est actuellement professeur émérite. Titulaire d'un doctorat en biochimie de la St Mary's Hospital Medical School, il a obtenu un doctorat ès sciences en pharmacologie de l'Université de Londres pour s'être distingué dans le domaine du métabolisme des médicaments. Ses travaux ont porté, notamment, sur l'importance de la stéréochimie dans la mise au point des médicaments. Il est auteur et directeur de publication et siège ou a siégé au comité de rédaction de plusieurs publications scientifiques. Il a été le cofondateur, en 1989, de la revue
Chirality
, qui aborde une gamme de sujets ayant trait à la stéréochimie, notamment la mise au point de médicaments, la pharmacologie, la synthèse et l'analyse. Il a agi à titre d'expert-conseil auprès d'organismes gouvernementaux de réglementation et de l'industrie. Il a donc les compétences voulues pour donner des conseils d'expert en tant que pharmacologue en ce qui a trait au métabolisme des médicaments et à la pharmacocinétique, ainsi qu'à l'importance de la stéréochimie dans la mise au point de médicaments, y compris les politiques et les pratiques en matière de réglementation s'y rapportant. Il a témoigné de l'importance de la stéréochimie pour les sociétés pharmaceutiques et les organismes gouvernementaux de réglementation dans les années 1980.
M. René Levy
[43]
M. Levy est professeur émérite au département de pharmacologie de l'Université de Washington, et expert-conseil auprès de la Metabolism and Transport Drug Interaction Database, qu'il a créée en 2002. Il a obtenu un doctorat en chimie pharmaceutique à l'Université de Californie en 1970. En 1977, il a été nommé professeur titulaire en sciences pharmaceutiques et professeur auxiliaire de chirurgie neurologique à l'Université de Washington, où il a été chef du département de pharmacologie de la School of Pharmacy, de 1980 (année de sa création) à 2006. Il s'est spécialisé dans le métabolisme des médicaments et, comme les autres experts, il est un auteur éminent. Il a été reconnu comme expert dans les domaines du métabolisme, de la pharmacocinétique et de la pharmacodynamie des produits médicamenteux et de leurs métabolites, notamment en ce qui a trait aux conséquences de la stéréosélectivité à cet égard. Il s'est intéressé aux déclarations, ou aux implications, dans le brevet qui ont trait à l'utilisation du (+)-citalopram comme antidépresseur chez les humains, à la question de savoir s'il était possible de prévoir que ce composé aurait des bienfaits thérapeutiques supérieurs à ceux du citalopram lui-même et si une telle prédiction avait un fondement factuel.
M. Stephen Graham Davies
[44]
Lundbeck a, quant à elle, appelé M. Davies comme témoin. Ce dernier enseigne à l'Université d'Oxford depuis 1980, où il occupe le poste de professeur Waynflete de chimie. Entre 2006 et 2011, il a également été directeur du département de chimie. Il a obtenu un doctorat en chimie à l'Université d'Oxford en 1975 ainsi qu'un doctorat ès sciences en chimie à l'Université de Paris en 1980. En 1989, il a fondé
Tetrahedron Asymmetry
, dont il est toujours le rédacteur en chef, revue qui fait état des percées dans le domaine de la stéréochimie. En 1991, il a fondé la société Oxford Asymmetry International PLC, dont il est le directeur. Il a reçu nombre de prix et a agi comme expert-conseil auprès de plusieurs sociétés pharmaceutiques. Il a témoigné sous forme d'affidavit ou de vive voix au nom de Lundbeck dans plusieurs pays où l'invention relative au (+)-citalopram a été contestée.
[45]
La question de savoir s'il devrait être reconnu, comme le propose Lundbeck, comme un expert en chimie médicinale a suscité des débats. En fin de compte, je l'ai considéré comme un expert en chimie médicinale et en chimie organique, y compris en ce qui a trait aux techniques de séparation, et en stéréochimie. Son témoignage a porté sur un vaste éventail de sujets, notamment sur l'évidence et l'insuffisance. Il a également formulé des commentaires sur les rapports d'experts de MM. Semmelhack, Dannheiser, Caldwell et Jenner.
M. Daniel Armstrong
[46]
M. Armstrong est professeur Robert A. Welch de chimie à l'Université du Texas à Arlington. Il enseigne les sciences de la séparation et dirige la recherche au premier cycle et aux cycles supérieurs dans les domaines de la chimie bioanalytique, des sciences de la séparation, de la science des colloïdes ainsi que de la chimie organique. Il a des compétences spécialisées en séparation des mélanges racémiques au moyen de diverses méthodes, notamment la recristallisation fractionnée, la résolution cinétique, la cristallisation directe des énantiomères et la CLHP chirale. Il est un inventeur nommé dans 14 brevets américains, portant principalement sur la séparation des mélanges racémiques par CLHP et au moyen d'autres techniques de séparation. Comme il est mentionné plus haut, il a participé, avec M. Beesley, à la création d'Astec, entreprise spécialisée dans la séparation énantiomérique, principalement par CLHP chirale sur colonnes de cyclodextrine. Des scientifiques et des clients lui ont fréquemment demandé de tenter de séparer des énantiomères et il a souvent agi comme expert-conseil aussi bien auprès de fabricants de médicaments d'origine que de médicaments génériques sur des questions liées au dédoublement des énantiomères. Dans ce cas également, comme les autres experts, ses titres de compétences, son expertise, ses publications et son rôle au sein de comités de rédaction forcent l'admiration. Il est reconnu comme un expert en techniques de dédoublement, y compris la CLHP chirale.
M. Peter Myers
[47]
M. Myers enseigne les sciences de la séparation au département de chimie de l'Université de Liverpool. Sa carrière s'est déroulée à la fois en milieu industriel et en milieu universitaire. Il a joué un rôle très important dans l'étude et la synthèse de microparticules de silice pour la CLHP. Il s'est joint en 1979 à une entreprise du Royaume-Uni, Phase Separations, qui s'occupe de la fabrication et de la distribution de produits de chromatographie. Après l'achat de cette entreprise par Waters Corporation, une société américaine, en 1995, il est demeuré en poste comme expert-conseil. Il a participé à la mise au point de produits de silice, y compris les produits utilisés par Astec, l'entreprise mise sur pied par MM. Amstrong et Beesley. Il est reconnu comme un expert en sciences de la séparation, y compris la chromatographie et la fabrication de silice chromatographique. Il a témoigné relativement à la faisabilité, en 1988, d'obtenir le (+)-citalopram par chromatographie.
Dr Pierre Blier
[48]
Le Dr Blier est actuellement professeur titulaire aux départements de psychiatrie et de médecine cellulaire et moléculaire de la faculté de médecine de l'Université d'Ottawa; il est aussi professeur auxiliaire au département de psychiatrie de l'Université McGill, professeur auxiliaire au département de neurosciences de l'Université Carleton et directeur du programme de recherche sur les troubles de l'humeur à l'Institut de recherche en santé mentale de l'Université d'Ottawa. Il a obtenu son doctorat en neurosciences à l'Université de Montréal en 1985. Il a reçu de nombreuses subventions de recherche attribuées à la suite d'un examen par des pairs et a un grand nombre de publications à son actif. Il est reconnu comme un expert en neuropsychologie, notamment en pharmacocinétique et en pharmacodynamie, plus précisément en ce qui concerne les ISRS. Il est en outre un médecin spécialisé dans le traitement des maladies mentales, en particulier la dépression. Son témoignage a porté sur les bienfaits thérapeutiques du (+)-citalopram et sur les promesses, le cas échéant, du brevet, quant aux bienfaits de cette substance dans le traitement de la dépression chez les humains par comparaison avec le citalopram.
Dr Gerd Bode
[49]
Le rapport d'expert du Dr Bode a été considéré comme ayant été lu. Le Dr Brode n'a pas été contre-interrogé par Apotex. Titulaire d'un doctorat en médecine et d'un Ph. D., il est un expert dans les domaines de l'anatomopathologie, de la neuropathologie, de la pharmacologie et de la toxicologie. Son témoignage portait sur la toxicité alléguée du pamoate de (+)-citalopram.
Sir Jack Baldwin
[50]
Apotex a appelé comme témoin Sir Jack Baldwin afin que ce dernier réponde aux propos de M. Davies concernant les règles dites de Baldwin, élaborées dans les années 1970. Sir Baldwin avait été le prédécesseur de M. Davies au poste de professeur Waynflete de chimie à l'Université d'Oxford, et il a reçu de nombreux prix. Il a été fait chevalier en 1997 pour ses réalisations en chimie organique. Il est reconnu comme un expert en chimie organique, synthétique et biologique. À l'instar de M. Davies, il a témoigné dans d'autres pays concernant le (+)-citalopram, mais toujours du côté soutenant que le brevet devait être tenu pour invalide.
[51]
Finalement, M. Dannheiser a été rappelé pour contester certaines des opinions du professeur Davies.
[52]
Je dirai sans hésitation que ces témoins étaient non seulement admirablement qualifiés pour offrir leur avis d'expert à la Cour, mais qu'ils étaient même tous surqualifiés. Ce ne sont pas des chimistes médicinaux ordinaires, des chimistes analytiques ordinaires, des pharmacologues ordinaires, etc. Chacun d'eux est une superstar. Le problème, pour eux comme pour la Cour, était de savoir s'ils avaient réussi à abaisser en quelque sorte leur expertise au niveau de la personne versée dans l'art en 1988.
V.
LE BREVET 452
[53]
La demande a été déposée le 13 juin 1989. Le brevet, délivré le 9 septembre 1997, était valide pour 17 ans. Il est déclaré que sa date de priorité est le 14 juin 1988, date à laquelle la première demande de brevet a été déposée au Royaume-Uni. Lundbeck a proposé que la date de priorité soit fixée en avril, au motif que le (+)-citalopram a été inventé ce mois-là. Toutefois, il n'a pas présenté cet argument avec vigueur et, quoi qu'il en soit, les experts conviennent que la situation n'a pas changé entre avril et juin 1988.
[54]
Les inventeurs étaient deux employés de Lundbeck: M. Klaus Peter Bøgesø et M. Jens Perregaard.
[55]
Pour expliciter l'abrégé, selon M. Jenner, le brevet s'adresse à des chimistes et à des pharmacologues ayant une connaissance des antidépresseurs. Il porte sur les énantiomères du citalopram et sur leur utilisation dans le traitement de la dépression chez les humains. Il porte également sur les méthodes d'obtention de ces énantiomères.
[56]
Les revendications 1 à 5 portent sur le (+)-citalopram lui-même, y compris ses sels et sa composition, tandis que les revendications 6 à 11 portent sur un composé intermédiaire et les méthodes d'utilisation de ce composé pour fabriquer le (+)-citalopram. Ces commentaires ne suscitent pas la controverse. Ce qui est plus controversé, c'est l'avis de certains selon lequel il est permis de prévoir que le (+)-citalopram est plus puissant chez les humains que le citalopram.
[57]
M. Davies signale que, selon le mémoire descriptif, il s'était avéré possible à ce moment-là (en 1988) de séparer le diol intermédiaire du citalopram en ses énantiomères et, de manière stéréosélective, de convertir ces énantiomères en énantiomères correspondants du citalopram. Un « diol » est un alcool présentant deux groupes hydroxyles par molécule.
[58]
Le brevet expose ensuite deux méthodes de séparation, appelées « A », « B » et « C », décrites en fonction des mécanismes de réaction chimique. Ces réactions comprennent la séparation du diol intermédiaire, ou d'un ester de celui-ci, suivie de la conversion des précurseurs ainsi obtenus en énantiomères du citalopram au moyen de conditions et de réactifs spécifiques. J'en traiterai plus en détail plus loin.
[59]
Le mémoire descriptif se termine par 11 revendications:
i. La revendication 1 porte sur le citalopram et ses sels d'addition acides non toxiques.
ii. La revendication 2 porte sur le sel d'acide pamoïque du (+)-citalopram.
iii. La revendication 3 porte sur une composition pharmaceutique utile comme antidépresseur, qui contient une quantité efficace de (+)-citalopram, ainsi qu'un diluant ou un adjuvant pharmaceutiquement acceptable.
iv. La revendication 4 est identique à la revendication 3, à l'exception du fait que le sel d'acide pamoïque du (+)-citalopram est l'ingrédient actif de la composition.
v. La revendication 5 dépend des revendications 3 et 4, et porte sur une composition présentée sous une forme pharmaceutique unitaire.
vi. La revendication 6 porte sur l'énantiomère (-) du diol intermédiaire, et sur un ester de ce dernier.
vii. La revendication 7 porte sur une méthode de production du (+)-citalopram.
viii. Les revendications 8 à 11 portent sur des méthodes qui dépendent de la revendication 7.
VI.
HISTORIQUE DES PROCÉDURES
[60]
Tout a commencé avec le Règlement MB (AC). Celui-ci a fait l'objet de nombreuses décisions, y compris d'arrêts de la Cour suprême:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2005] ACS no 26 (QL), aux paragraphes 5 à 24; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2008] ACS no 63 (QL) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 7 et 12 à 17.
[61]
En avril 2007, Apotex a signifié, conformément au Règlement, un avis d'allégation à Lundbeck Canada Inc., la titulaire de licence du brevet dans lequel elle affirmait que le brevet 452 était invalide pour divers motifs. Celui qui se rapportait à l'invalidité du brevet de sélection n'a pas été débattu dans le cadre du présent procès. À son tour, Lundbeck a déposé le mois suivant un avis de demande devant la Cour, dans le dossier de la Cour no T-991-07, en vue d'obtenir, conformément au Règlement, une ordonnance interdisant au ministre de la Santé de délivrer un avis de conformité avant l'expiration du brevet.
[62]
En février 2009, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 53, [2009] ACF no 249 (QL), j'ai fait droit à cette demande et interdit au ministre de délivrer un avis de conformité à Apotex. Cette décision a été confirmée par la Cour d'appel fédérale, 2010 CAF 320, 88 CPR (4th) 325, [2010] ACF no 1504 (QL). La demande d'autorisation d'appel devant la Cour suprême a été rejetée (voir Renseignements sur les dossiers de la Cour, no de dossier 34066).
[63]
En théorie, le Règlement MB (AC) est sommaire de par sa nature. Il n'était pas censé être contraignant pour les parties en ce qui a trait à la validité ou à la contrefaçon. La question était simplement de savoir s'il fallait interdire au ministre d'accorder effectivement une licence à Apotex. Les parties ont le droit de plaider l'invalidité et la contrefaçon dans le cadre d'une action plutôt que d'une demande. Lundbeck devait simplement répondre aux allégations contenues dans l'avis d'allégation, dans lequel l'absence de contrefaçon n'était même pas invoquée.
[64]
Comme je l'ai fait remarquer dans le cadre de cette instance, un procès est bien plus souhaitable du point de vue du juge, comme d'ailleurs de celui des parties. Contrairement aux actions, les demandes ne donnent pas lieu à une divulgation complète de documents ni à des interrogatoires préalables. Aucun témoignage n'est entendu en cour. La preuve se limite à des affidavits et aux contre-interrogatoires qui s'y rapportent. La Cour ne peut pas demander des clarifications aux témoins experts. Dans le cadre du présent procès, la plupart des experts sont nouveaux et une grande partie de la preuve est inédite.
[65]
Il n'est pas rare du tout qu'un brevet soit jugé invalide lors du procès, même si le ministre était précédemment sous le coup d'une interdiction de délivrer un avis de conformité. Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour suprême a maintenu l'ordonnance d'interdiction rendue par la présente Cour. Cependant, le brevet a ensuite été jugé invalide lors du procès sur le fond (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 1, [2011] ACF no 1813 (QL), actuellement en appel).
[66]
La Cour a pris l'habitude, lorsque c'est possible, de charger le juge qui a entendu la demande d'avis de conformité d'instruire le procès. L'idée maîtresse est qu'il est difficile de se familiariser avec ces brevets pharmaceutiques, et qu'il est donc préférable d'affecter au procès le juge qui a déjà examiné le brevet. Ce seul élément ne suscite pas de conflit d'intérêts ni de crainte de partialité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 1692 (QL)).
[67]
J'ai soulevé ce point assez rapidement lors de la conférence de gestion de l'instruction. Les parties ont consenti à que je sois le juge du procès. En fait, ces dernières, et Apotex en particulier, ont composé leur preuve de manière à répondre à l'une de mes préoccupations, à savoir que les experts avaient du recul et n'envisageaient pas le (+)-citalopram d'après l'état des connaissances en 1988.
[68]
Je me pencherai à présent sur les allégations d'invalidité.
VII.
INVALIDITÉ
A. Anticipation
[69]
L'arrêt de principe canadien est <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, de la Cour suprême. L'article 27 de la
Loi sur les brevets
, dans sa version à la date pertinente, exigeait notamment que l'invention visée par le brevet ne soit pas « décrite dans quelque brevet ou dans quelque publication imprimée au Canada ou dans tout autre pays plus de deux ans avant la présentation de la pétition ci-après mentionnée [...] ».
[70]
D'après Apotex, les revendications visant le (+)-citalopram lui-même comme composé, à savoir les revendications 1 à 5, sont invalides parce qu'elles sont antériorisées par la divulgation antérieure du (+)-citalopram comme composant du citalopram.
[71]
Des brevets antérieurs, délivrés plus de deux ans avant la demande, divulguaient des renseignements sur le citalopram, par exemple le brevet américain 4 136 193. Le fait que le citalopram était un racémate contenant des quantités égales de (+)-citalopram et de (-)-citalopram et le fait que les énantiomères pouvaient avoir des effets thérapeutiques différents entre eux, ou par rapport au composé lui-même, faisaient partie des connaissances générales courantes.
[72]
Cependant, la réalisation du brevet 193 ou la fabrication du diol intermédiaire divulgué dans le brevet américain 4 650 884 ne peuvent qu'aboutir à l'obtention d'un mélange racémique, et non à des énantiomères distincts, ce qui fait échec à la prétention d'Apotex.
[73]
Le critère relatif à l'antériorité a été formulé par le juge Hugessen, s'exprimant au nom de la Cour d'appel fédérale, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), à la page 297:
Il faut en effet pouvoir s'en remettre à une seule publication antérieure et y trouver tous les renseignements nécessaires, en pratique, à la production de l'invention revendiquée sans l'exercice de quelque génie inventif. Les instructions contenues dans la publication antérieure doivent être d'une clarté telle qu'une personne au fait de l'art qui en prend connaissance et s'y conforme arrivera infailliblement à l'invention revendiquée.
[74]
Ce critère a été approuvé par la Cour suprême dans l'arrêt
Free World Trust
, précité.
[75]
Après avoir renvoyé à des décisions anglaises récentes, le juge Rothstein a établi, dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , que l'antériorité comportait deux volets: la divulgation antérieure et le caractère réalisable. La divulgation antérieure signifie que la réalisation du brevet entraînerait nécessairement une contrefaçon.
[76]
Il a estimé que la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne concernait que la divulgation antérieure. Il n'était pas nécessaire que le juge Hugessen se demande si cette divulgation rendait également l'invention réalisable.
[77]
En l'espèce, il n'y a pas eu de divulgation antérieure puisque les brevets précédents ne montraient pas comment dédoubler le citalopram, pas plus qu'ils ne divulguaient les effets thérapeutiques du (+)-citalopram.
[78]
À part les brevets, D.F. Smith, de l'Unité de recherche de psychopharmacologie de l'Hôpital psychiatrique de Risskov, au Danemark, avait publié deux articles: « Stereochemical Considerations of the Actions of Some Psychotropic Drugs » en 1985 dans
Pharmacopsychiat
, et « The Stereoselectivity of Serotonin Uptake in Brain Tissue and Blood Platelets: the Topography of the Serotonin Uptake Area » en 1986 dans
Neuroscience & Biobehavorial Reviews
. Cependant, ces articles n'expliquent pas du tout comment on peut obtenir les énantiomères à partir du citalopram. Par ailleurs, l'auteur avait prédit que l'activité serait concentrée dans l'énantiomère R alors qu'il s'avère que c'est surtout l'énantiomère S qui est actif.
B. Évidence
[79]
Contrairement à l'article 28.3 de la
Loi sur les brevets
actuellement en vigueur, l'ancienne version de la Loi ne précisait pas que l'objet d'une revendication ne devait pas être évident « pour une personne versée dans l'art ou la science dont relève l'objet [...] ». Cependant, il a toujours été établi que l'article 28.3 était une disposition simplement interprétative en ce qu'une invention doit, par définition, avoir le caractère de la nouveauté (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 51).
[80]
Qui est donc cette personne versée dans l'art?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 9 CPR (4th) 129, [2000] ACS no 68 (QL), précité, au paragraphe 42, le juge Binnie déclare, en citant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 517, que le brevet doit fournir une description de l'invention « comportant des détails assez complets et précis pour qu'un ouvrier, versé dans l'art auquel l'invention appartient, puisse construire ou exploiter l'invention après la fin du monopole ».
[81]
Si elle est évidente pour une telle personne, l' « invention » n'est pas brevetable.
[82]
La personne versée dans l'art n'existe pas dans la législation sur les brevets: elle est une création judiciaire. S'agissant d'appliquer ce concept au regard de l'évidence, le juge Hugessen a déclaré, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2008] ACS no 63 (QL)), au paragraphe 52:
Pour établir si une invention est évidente, il ne s'agit pas de se demander ce que des inventeurs compétents ont ou auraient fait pour solutionner le problème. Un inventeur est par définition inventif. La pierre de touche classique de l'évidence de l'invention est le technicien versé dans son art mais qui ne possède aucune étincelle d'esprit inventif ou d'imagination; un parangon de déduction et de dextérité complètement dépourvu d'intuition; un triomphe de l'hémisphère gauche sur le droit. Il s'agit de se demander si, compte tenu de l'état de la technique et des connaissances générales courantes qui existaient au moment où l'invention aurait été faite, cette créature mythique (monsieur tout-le-monde du domaine des brevets) serait directement et facilement arrivée à la solution que préconise le brevet. C'est un critère auquel il est très difficile de satisfaire.
[83]
Un autre commentaire éclairant est formulé par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'apprécier du point de vue de la personne versée dans l'art mais dépourvue d'inventivité. Cette personne n'existe pas, elle est une création juridique servant de critère objectif pour déterminer si une idée particulière peut être protégée par un brevet. Elle est réputée avoir examiné et lu les documents accessibles au public et être au fait des usages notoires dont font état les antériorités. Elle comprend toutes les langues et tous les dialectes, ce qui est évident ne lui échappe jamais, et elle ne cherche pas à être inventive. Elle n'a aucune préférence ni aversion particulière, et il lui manque singulièrement d'imagination. Elle se distingue de tous les gens réels par au moins l'une de ces caractéristiques. Un travailleur réel dans le domaine peut ne jamais prendre connaissance d'un document d'art antérieur - par exemple, il pourrait ne jamais s'intéresser au contenu d'une bibliothèque publique particulière, ou être découragé parce que les ouvrages qu'elle contient sont publiés dans une langue qu'il ne connaît pas. Mais la personne fictive versée dans l'art passe pour avoir fait tout cela. Ceci reflète un des aspects de la politique qui sous-tend le concept juridique de l'évidence. Tous les prolongements évidents d'idées publiques ne peuvent ensuite être validement protégés par un brevet même si, en pratique, peu de personnes auraient pris la peine d'écumer les antériorités ou auraient trouvé les éléments particuliers visés. Les brevets ne servent pas à protéger la découverte et la propagation d'une information publique et de ses prolongements évidents, mais seulement de nouvelles inventions. Un travailleur qui découvre ou obtient une antériorité, ou qui tombe dessus par hasard, doit réaliser qu'il ne peut se voir accorder de monopole sur ces connaissances et leurs prolongements évidents; il reçoit par ailleurs l'assurance que personne ne peut obtenir un tel monopole.
[84]
Il est bien sûr important de ne pas prendre ces mots au pied de la lettre (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  d'une loi. Par exemple, dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, le juge Rothstein a limité la fameuse déclaration du juge Hugessen touchant l'antériorité à la divulgation antérieure, en excluant le caractère réalisable.
[85]
Un certain nombre de questions sont soulevées:
i. Le (+)-citalopram était-il évident pour les personnes auxquelles le brevet s'adressait?
ii. Les techniques utilisées avec succès par Lundbeck résultaient-elles d'un « essai allant de soi » ?
iii. Existait-il un facteur de motivation ou un motif pour obtenir le (+)-citalopram?
iv. Les autres techniques satisfaisaient-elles au critère de l' « essai allant de soi » ?
v. Était-il évident et manifeste que les techniques utilisées ou qui auraient pu être utilisées auraient été couronnées de succès?
vi. Est-ce que les résultats des expériences menées avec succès en 2012 auraient été les mêmes si celles-ci avaient été réalisées en 1988? Ces expériences étaient-elles courantes?
vii. Les inventeurs ont-ils eu la tâche facile?
[86]
Avant de décider si le (+)-citalopram était évident, s'il était évident d'appliquer diverses techniques et s'il était probable que ces techniques fonctionnent, il faut comprendre ce que Lundbeck a fait. Pour résumer la preuve présentée par M. Semmelhack, le brevet décrivait trois procédés de synthèse.
[87]
Le premier procédé concerne:
i. la conversion du diol du citalopram en un ester covalent diastéréoisomère par adjonction d'un chlorure d'acide optiquement pur et d'un hydrure ou d'un ester labile dans un solvant organique inerte;
ii. la purification des diastéréoisomères, par chromatographie (en particulier la CLHP) ou cristallisation;
iii. l'adjonction d'une base forte fermant le cycle et permettant ainsi d'obtenir un seul énantiomère du citalopram.
Cette fermeture du cycle, nécessaire pour obtenir une structure chirale, donne lieu à une grande divergence d'opinions entre les experts.
[88]
Le deuxième procédé concerne la séparation du diol du citalopram en ses deux énantiomères par l'adjonction d'un acide optiquement actif, dont certains exemples ont été donnés.
[89]
Le troisième procédé a trait à la conversion des énantiomères purs préparés selon le deuxième procédé. La synthèse comprend:
i. la conversion de l'alcool primaire pour former un ester labile;
ii. l'adjonction simultanée d'une base dans un solvant organique inerte à 0 degré Celsius.
[90]
Apotex soutient que ce qui a été réalisé faisait bien partie des connaissances générales courantes du destinataire versé dans l'art et de l'état de la technique en 1988. Le dédoublement était certainement la technique la plus évidente. Cette méthode comprenait le dédoublement des diastéréoisomères, aussi bien covalents qu'ioniques.
[91]
L'autre technique serait fondée sur la CLHP chirale. Même si Lundbeck a essayé la CLHP sans succès, le résultat souhaité aurait été obtenu en une semaine au maximum, quelle que soit la méthode.
[92]
La question de savoir si l'on devait partir du citalopram lui-même ou d'un précurseur fait débat. J'estime que si l'un n'avait pas fonctionné, la personne versée dans l'art aurait essayé l'autre.
[93]
À mon avis, la question n'est pas tant de savoir quelle technique la personne versée dans l'art aurait pu employer pour tâcher de parvenir au (+)-citalopram, mais plutôt si ces techniques auraient été fructueuses, compte tenu du large éventail d'agents chimiques qui pouvaient entrer dans la réaction et d'autres variables. Il s'agit en fait de savoir s'il « allait de soi » ou non d'employer certaines techniques, et si à un moment donné la frustration n'aurait pas mené à l'abandon. Le fardeau de preuve incombe à Apotex. L'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, qui portait également sur un racémate et des énantiomères, est particulièrement instructif. S'exprimant au nom de la Cour, le juge Rothstein a écrit au paragraphe 66:
Pour conclure qu'une invention résulte d'un « essai allant de soi », le tribunal doit être convaincu selon la prépondérance des probabilités qu'il allait plus ou moins de soi de tenter d'arriver à l'invention. La seule possibilité d'obtenir quelque chose ne suffit pas.
[94]
Il a endossé l'approche en quatre étapes élaborée par le lord juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (p. 872), [2007] EWCA Civ 588, au paragraphe 23:
[traduction] Par conséquent, je
reformulerai
s comme suit la démarche préconisée dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
1) a) Identifier la « personne versée dans l'art ».
b) Déterminer les connaissances générales courantes pertinentes de cette personne.
2) Définir l'idée originale de la revendication en cause, au besoin par voie d'interprétation.
3) Recenser les différences, s'il en est, entre ce qui ferait partie de « l'état de la technique » et l'idée originale qui sous-tend la revendication ou son interprétation.
4) Abstraction faite de toute connaissance de l'invention revendiquée, ces différences constituent-elles des étapes évidentes pour la personne versée dans l'art ou dénotent-elles quelque inventivité?
[95]
Le juge Rothstein était d'avis que la question de l'essai « allant de soi » se poserait à la quatrième étape de l'approche énoncée dans les arrêts
Windsurfing/Pozzoli
.
[96]
Si l'application de ce critère est justifiée, poursuivait-il au paragraphe 69:
Lorsque l'application du critère de l' « essai allant de soi » est justifiée, les éléments énumérés ci-après doivent être pris en compte à la quatrième étape de l'examen de l'évidence. Tout comme ceux pertinents pour l'antériorité, ils ne sont pas exhaustifs et s'appliquent selon la preuve offerte dans le cas considéré.
1. Est-il plus ou moins évident que l'essai sera fructueux? Existe-t-il un nombre déterminé de solutions prévisibles connues des personnes versées dans l'art?
2. Quels efforts - leur nature et leur ampleur - sont requis pour réaliser l'invention? Les essais sont-ils courants ou l'expérimentation est-elle longue et ardue de telle sorte que les essais ne peuvent être qualifiés de courants?
3. L'art antérieur fournit-il un motif de rechercher la solution au problème qui sous-tend le brevet?
[97]
On a présenté au procès une quantité considérable d'éléments de preuve en ce qui concerne les moyens qui permettaient de séparer, en 1988, les énantiomères du citalopram en quantités suffisantes pour pouvoir tester leurs caractéristiques; ces techniques seraient-elles venues à l'esprit de la personne versée dans l'art et leur application lui aurait-elle demandé des efforts? Des expériences ont été effectuées pour démontrer qu'il aurait été facile ou compliqué de dédoubler le citalopram, dépendamment de ceux qui les ont commanditées.
[98]
M. Timothy Ward, qui a réussi à dédoubler le citalopram dans les mois qui ont précédé le procès en se servant de l'une des inventions de M. Armstrong, a déclaré que la réalisation de son expérience ressemblait à plusieurs égards à la reproduction d'une recette issue d'un livre de cuisine. S'il n'y avait pas tant de jurisprudence sur ce point, j'aurais été enclin à penser que la personne susceptible d'arriver au résultat recherché, sans consulter le brevet en question, c'est-à-dire le livre de recettes, possédait des compétences supérieures à celles à qui le brevet était destiné. Suivre une recette est une chose, la réaliser est une tout autre histoire.
i. Motivation
[99]
La question de la motivation a pris une importance toute particulière. Apotex a déclaré que les scientifiques étaient alors extrêmement motivés par l'idée de séparer les racémates pharmaceutiques compte tenu de l'intérêt des autorités réglementaires, notamment celles des deux marchés les plus importants, à savoir les États-Unis et le Japon. De son côté, Lundbeck a minimisé l'importance de la motivation. Cette conception de la motivation me préoccupe. Les désirs n'accouchent pas de la réalité et ne facilitent pas les choses. Un motif est ce qui pousse ou tend à pousser une personne à adopter un plan d'action particulier (
Oxford Dictionary
). Par ailleurs, il est possible que rien ne justifie une initiative à un moment donné. Par exemple, l'amélioration du rendement énergétique des automobiles n'a pas forcément suscité un grand intérêt dans les années 1950. L'absence d'intérêt ne donnerait pas lieu à un brevet si l'invention finale était évidente.
[100]
J'estime que Lundbeck avait un motif de dédoubler le citalopram. Le fait que chacun des énantiomères tridimensionnels pouvait se lier à ses récepteurs dans le corps humain de manière différente, de telle sorte que l'un soit plus bénéfique que l'autre, faisait partie des connaissances générales courantes. Comme nous l'avons déjà mentionné, on se doutait que l'autre énantiomère aurait peut-être des effets secondaires indésirables, voire catastrophiques.
[101]
Il a été fait mention du thalidomide, dont on estimait qu'un énantiomère était très utile dans le traitement des nausées chez la femme enceinte, tandis que l'autre causait de terribles malformations congénitales. Il semble toutefois généralement admis, aujourd'hui, que l'énantiomère bénéfique était reconverti en mélange racémique dans l'organisme (cinquante pour cent de l'énantiomère « bénéfique » était converti par l'organisme en énantiomère « nocif »).
[102]
La Federal Drug Administration (FDA) américaine a commencé à manifester de l'intérêt, et a même demandé au titulaire américain de licence de Lundbeck de lui fournir des renseignements sur les énantiomères du citalopram dès qu'ils seraient disponibles. Cependant, aucune exigence réglementaire ne faisait de la décomposition des racémates une condition de leur approbation par la FDA; c'est encore le cas aujourd'hui. Ce régime réglementaire, qui prévoit des essais cliniques chez les humains, est assez différent du régime des brevets, quoiqu'il faille rajouter qu'un brevet de médicament n'est pas particulièrement utile si le médicament n'est pas commercialisable. Il n'était pas nécessaire de démontrer l'efficacité du (+)-citalopram par des études cliniques sur les humains si le brevet divulguait un fondement rationnel permettant valablement de prédire son utilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2002] ACS no 78 (QL), au paragraphe 3 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
[103]
Nonobstant la fierté professionnelle de M. Bøgesø, un des inventeurs à avoir témoigné, les universitaires commençaient à s'intéresser au citalopram. Lundbeck craignait que quelqu'un d'autre soit en mesure de le dédoubler avant elle, ce qui aurait empêché le brevetage du (+)-citalopram et entraîné une diminution des profits puisque, dans le meilleur des cas, des accords de licences croisées auraient été conclus.
[104]
Même si la motivation rendait évidente la tentative de dédoublement du citalopram, comme le déclarait le juge Rothstein au paragraphe 65 de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité: « J'estime que la notion d'"essai allant de soi" n'est applicable que lorsqu'il est très clair ou, pour reprendre les termes employés par le lord juge Jacob, qu'il est plus ou moins évident, que l'essai sera fructueux. » Cette mention du lord juge Jacob renvoie à l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (BAILII), au paragraphe 35:
[traduction] La seule inclusion possible de quelque chose dans un programme de recherche dans l'optique d'en apprendre davantage et de faire une découverte ne suffit pas. S'il en allait autrement, peu d'inventions seraient brevetables. L'éventualité d'une protection ne justifierait la recherche que dans des domaines n'offrant aucune chance de découverte. La notion d' « essai allant de soi » ne s'applique vraiment que lorsqu'il est plus ou moins évident que l'essai sera fructueux.
[105]
Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Rothstein a également cité le paragraphe 58 de la décision du juge Kennedy, qui s'exprimait au nom de la Cour suprême des États- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (2007):
À la p. 1742, il dit clairement que le critère de l' « essai allant de soi » peut être appliqué dans le cadre de l'examen portant sur l'évidence:
[traduction] La même interprétation étroite a amené la Court of Appeals à conclure erronément que l'évidence de la revendication d'un brevet ne peut être établie par le seul fait que la combinaison des éléments constituait un « essai allant de soi ». [...] Lorsqu'un besoin précis ou la pression du marché incite à résoudre un problème et qu'il existe un nombre limité de solutions connues et prévisibles, la personne dotée de compétences usuelles a une bonne raison d'opter pour celles qui, parmi ces solutions, sont techniquement à sa portée. Si le résultat escompté est obtenu, il est sans doute attribuable à des compétences usuelles et au bon sens, et non à l'innovation. Dans ce cas, le fait que la combinaison des éléments constituait un essai allant de soi en démontrerait peut-être le caractère évident au sens de l'art. 103.
[106]
Les faits dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> étaient très différents de ceux de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et de l'affaire dont nous sommes saisis. Il y était question de capteurs électroniques dans des pédales d'accélération automobiles. Il a été établi que le fait de monter un capteur modulaire sur un point de pivotement fixe de la pédale était une étape de conception tout à fait à la portée d'une personne ayant des compétences ordinaires dans l'art concerné. Le brevet en question reposait sur une combinaison d'éléments de l'art antérieur. Comme le déclarait le juge Kennedy à la page 1739:
[traduction] Depuis plus d'un demi-siècle, la Cour a affirmé qu'un brevet qui ne se rapporte qu'à une combinaison d'éléments connus sans rien changer à leurs fonctions respectives [...] soumet manifestement ce qui est déjà connu à la portée de son monopole et diminue ainsi les ressources disponibles pour les hommes de métier. [...] La combinaison d'éléments familiers selon des méthodes connues risque d'être évidente lorsqu'elle ne produit rien d'autre que des résultats prévisibles.
[107]
Il poursuit aux pages 1741 et 1742:
[traduction] Pour déterminer si l'objet d'une revendication de brevet est évidente, ce n'est ni la motivation particulière ni l'objectif déclaré du breveté qui importe, mais la portée objective de la revendication. Si la revendication porte sur ce qui est évident, elle est invalide [...] Un des moyens de prouver que l'objet d'un brevet est évident est de démontrer qu'il existait au moment de l'invention un problème connu appelant une solution évidente comprise dans les revendications du brevet.
[108]
Tout bien considéré, j'estime que la motivation est un facteur neutre. Comme l'a noté le juge Kennedy, la motivation du breveté n'a pas d'importance. Il faut atteindre un équilibre. Si ce critère invite à fournir plus d'efforts ou à envisager des approches plus variées, à un moment donné, les expériences perdent leur caractère courant et font intervenir une certaine inventivité.
[109]
Cette affaire repose sur les avis d'expert. Comment la Cour choisira-t-elle l'avis qui mérite préséance? Certainement pas en fonction des connaissances chimiques des experts, ni même de leurs connaissances à ce chapitre en 1988. Même à cette époque, ces experts surqualifiés avaient des compétences bien supérieures à celles de la personne versée dans l'art.
[110]
D'après Apotex, il faudrait considérer la quatrième question de l'approche
Windsurfing/Pozzoli
, telle que citée par le juge Rothstein dans
Plavix,
« [a]bstraction faite de toute connaissance de l'invention revendiquée ». MM. Semmelhack et Dannheiser se sont simplement vu remettre la formule du citalopram, et ont été priés d'expliquer comment le chimiste hypothétique pourvu de compétences ordinaires en aurait tiré un seul énantiomère. Par ailleurs, M. Davies connaissait bien le brevet 452 et ses variantes étrangères, puisqu'il avait témoigné pour le compte de Lundbeck dans nombre d'affaires antérieures. Ce facteur n'a pas grande importance sans quoi, les experts ne pourraient témoigner qu'une seule fois en cette qualité. À un moment ou un autre, l'expert doit examiner le brevet.
[111]
Si le message vous déplait, tirez sur le messager. Comme Apotex ne pouvait pas contester les connaissances de M. Davies en chimie, elle m'exhorte à ne pas tenir compte de son avis parce qu'il fait partie de l'équipe de plaideurs de Lundbeck.
[112]
Lundbeck ne peut pas vraiment s'en étonner, puisqu'elle a soulevé le même argument dans l'instance relative à l'avis de conformité. Elle avait alors demandé avec insistance que l'avis d'un témoin expert, qui n'avait pas été appelé dans ce procès, soit écarté parce qu'il avait comparu pour Apotex à plus de trente reprises. Si M. Davies est appelé pour témoigner pour tous les brevets, c'est qu'en définitive il défend toujours le même. J'avais refusé alors de minimiser l'importance d'un avis pour ce motif, et je m'y refuse encore.
[113]
On a fait remarquer par exemple que M. Davies avait assisté aux déclarations préliminaires. Les experts ont le droit d'être présents tout au long du procès.
[114]
L'avis écrit qu'il a fourni en l'espèce et son témoignage ne correspondaient pas tout à fait à ses dépositions dans quatre autres affaires. Cependant, il faut garder à l'esprit que Lundbeck était parfois défenderesse, et parfois demanderesse. Ainsi, dans l'instance relative à l'avis de conformité, la portée des questions à trancher était circonscrite par l'avis de demande d'Apotex. Il n'était pas nécessaire que M. Davies s'exprime sur des choses qui n'avaient pas été alléguées.
[115]
Il a toujours affirmé qu'il existait au moins treize manières de séparer les racémates. On a laissé entendre qu'il voulait rendre le problème plus compliqué qu'il ne l'était en réalité. Il s'agit néanmoins de savoir s'il existait oui ou non treize manières différentes de procéder. Il n'a jamais été contredit. Par ailleurs, il est clair, du moins à mes yeux, eu égard à son rapport et à son témoignage, que la plupart de ces techniques seraient immédiatement écartées, par lui comme par la personne versée dans l'art qui examinerait la formule chimique du citalopram ou de l'un de ses précurseurs. La déclaration peignait simplement le contexte.
[116]
Quant à la technique employée avec succès par Lundbeck pour séparer les diastéréomères, il déclarait dans son rapport: [traduction] « Il faut noter qu'il se peut très bien que les différences entre les deux diastéréomères produits soient si négligeables (et elles le sont souvent), que la séparation ne puisse être obtenue par cette méthode, en particulier par la cristallisation. » Il n'a pas dit cela dans d'autres rapports. Cependant, l'important n'est pas de savoir ce qu'il a dit ou omis de dire ailleurs, mais si d'une manière générale cette déclaration est vraie. Comme il n'a jamais été contredit, je la tiens pour exacte. Ni M. Semmelhack ni M. Dannheiser n'étaient particulièrement enthousiasmés par la cristallisation.
[117]
M. Davies était un témoin plutôt prudent et hésitant, ce qui n'est pas surprenant compte tenu de la vigueur du contre-interrogatoire. Même s'il n'était pas aussi spontané que M. Dannheiser, par exemple, je ne trierai pas les experts en fonction de leur personnalité. Les avis que j'ai reçus correspondaient à ce que les experts estimaient être à la portée de la personne versée dans l'art à l'époque, ou considéraient comme les connaissances générales courantes et les recherches bibliographiques ayant pu ou ayant dû être effectuées.
[118]
Pour sa part, Lundbeck fait observer que je devrais préférer l'avis de M. Davies à ceux de MM. Semmelhack et Dannheiser, car ceux-ci étaient déjà des experts éminents dans le domaine en 1988 et que leurs connaissances et aperçus étaient de loin supérieurs à ceux de la personne versée dans l'art. Cet argument a du poids.
[119]
Je me pencherai à présent sur les différentes techniques que la personne versée dans l'art aurait envisagées, selon les experts.
ii. Dédoublement
[120]
Les experts ont cité un certain nombre de méthodes par lesquelles le (+)-citalopram pouvait être obtenu, mais seules deux d'entre elles méritent d'être examinées: le dédoublement chimique et la CLHP chirale.
[121]
MM. Semmelhack, Dannheiser et Davies étaient les principaux experts en ce qui a trait au dédoublement chimique. Sir Jack Baldwin a été appelé lorsqu'il a été question des règles de Baldwin; M. Armstrong, qui s'est exprimé au sujet de la CLHP chirale, a été appelé à commenter les techniques de dédoublement durant son contre-interrogatoire.
[122]
La question n'est pas tant de savoir comment aborder le problème d'un point de vue théorique, mais plutôt si certaines techniques auraient paru évidentes au chimiste médicinal « ordinaire » et à son équipe en 1988, et si elles auraient fonctionné. MM. Semmelhack et Dannheiser ont chacun proposé une méthode de dédoublement sans même consulter le brevet, et elles ressemblaient beaucoup à celle qu'il contient. Apotex prétend que comme ils y sont parvenus en se mettant dans la peau du chimiste médicinal « ordinaire », la méthode était donc évidente pour ceux à qui le brevet s'adressait. Pour Lundbeck, cela prouve simplement qu'elle avait raison, c'est-à-dire que les deux scientifiques sont trop qualifiés pour se mettre à la place du chimiste médicinal « ordinaire » en 1988. Je suis d'accord avec cette position.
[123]
M. Semmelhack a estimé qu'un chimiste versé dans l'art se serait attendu à obtenir un seul énantiomère en ayant recours à quatre méthodes:
i. la production de sels diastéréoisomères du citalopram, qui pourraient ensuite être séparés par cristallisation fractionnée;
ii. la production d'un diastéréoisomère covalent d'un diol précurseur, qui pourrait ensuite être séparé par cristallisation fractionnée ou par chromatographie;
iii. la production d'un sel diastéréoisomère d'un diol précurseur du citalopram, qui pourrait ensuite être séparé par cristallisation fractionnée;
iv. la chromatographie chirale. Toutefois, n'étant pas un expert dans le domaine, il ne pouvait pas faire de commentaires à ce sujet.
[124]
Le chimiste versé dans l'art travaillerait à partir du diol décrit dans le brevet américain 4650884, délivré en 1987, mais fondé sur une date de priorité anglaise de 1984.
[125]
Le citalopram lui-même est décrit dans le brevet américain 4136193, accordé en 1979, et reposant sur une date de priorité anglaise de 1976.
[126]
Il a expliqué que la différence entre l'état de la technique et le concept d'innovation tenait au fait que l'état de la technique [traduction] « ne contient aucune énonciation explicite de la préparation du (+)-citalopram par séparation du diol du (-)-citalopram et fermeture du cycle qui permet d'éviter la racémisation au niveau du centre stéréogène clé ». Il a toutefois estimé que le chimiste versé dans l'art n'aurait pas eu à faire montre d'un esprit inventif parce que les procédés chimiques exposés dans le brevet 452 étaient fondés sur des principes fondamentaux de synthèse organique et étaient bien connus.
[127]
À son avis, M. Bøgesø, l'un des inventeurs, contrairement au destinataire théorique, avait des idées préconçues à l'égard de la voie du diol. Il n'a pas tenu compte du fait que la fermeture du cycle pourrait être effectuée dans des conditions basiques. La voie du diol serait privilégiée parce qu'elle permettrait le dédoublement par chromatographie, dont la réussite serait presque certaine.
[128]
À l'époque, le chimiste versé dans l'art aurait eu recours à des techniques ordinaires pour purifier, ou séparer, une substance donnée. La cristallisation fractionnée et la chromatographie exploitent toutes deux les différences de propriétés physiques et chimiques des divers composants d'un mélange donné.
[129]
Le chimiste versé dans l'art aurait eu recours à la cristallisation fractionnée pour exploiter les différences de solubilité entre les composants d'un mélange et dans la manière dont ils cristallisent. Il aurait produit un sel du composé en question. Si ce dernier avait été un acide, une base aurait été ajoutée. S'il avait été une base, un acide aurait été ajouté. La réaction acide-base se produirait dans une solution, qui serait ensuite refroidie dans l'espoir que les substances se cristallisent. La substance la moins soluble est généralement présente en plus grande quantité dans la substance ou le précipité cristallisé, étant donné que la substance la plus soluble préfère demeurer en solution. La technique peut être répétée à maintes reprises et a été utilisée pendant un certain nombre d'années. Cela étant, il avertit toutefois que les cristaux ne se forment pas toujours facilement et qu'il n'est pas certain que les composants du mélange auront une solubilité suffisamment différente pour permettre la purification. Dans le cas de la chromatographie, cependant, une telle incertitude n'existe pas.
[130]
La chromatographie (CLHP non chirale) consiste à:
i. remplir un tube ou une colonne d'une poudre absorbante appelée phase stationnaire;
ii. appliquer la molécule devant être purifiée sur cette phase;
iii. verser la phase mobile ou le solvant à travers la colonne;
iv. recueillir les composants qui ont été entraînés. La vitesse de séparation des différentes substances variera parce que les divers composants du mélange réalisent des interactions d'intensité différente avec la phase stationnaire.
[131]
En ce qui concerne le dépouillement d'ouvrages spécialisés, la personne versée dans l'art n'en avait pas besoin personnellement, mais elle pouvait consulter certains ouvrages généraux et d'autres portant spécifiquement sur la stéréochimie, notamment ceux de Jacques, Collet et Wilen:
Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions,
1981, et d'Eliel:
Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds
, 1962. Le chimiste versé dans l'art se serait également reporté à un certain nombre de publications de chimie bien connues, comme le
Journal of American Chemical Society
,
Angewante Chemie
, le
Journal of Organic Chemistry,
le
Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Tetrahedron
,
Tetrahedron Letters,
le
Journal of the Royal Chemical Society (Chemical Communications, Perkin Series)
et
Synthesis
.
[132]
On utilisait le
Chemical Abstracts
pour rechercher les brevets et les articles de revues. Il s'agissait d'un système non informatisé fonctionnant à l'aide de mots-clés.
[133]
Le chimiste versé dans l'art rejetterait certaines méthodes, comme la synthèse à partir d'un « réservoir chiral » (
chiral pool
) ou la synthèse asymétrique. La séparation des diastéréoisomères serait la meilleure façon d'obtenir des quantités de l'ordre du gramme. Le chimiste versé dans l'art reconnaîtrait que le diol possède des groupes fonctionnels ou « points d'ancrage » qui rendent évidente et facile à réaliser la formation d'un diastéréoisomère covalent. Le risque que la fermeture du cycle ne se fasse pas serait presque inexistant.
[134]
À son avis, un chimiste versé dans l'art, à l'époque, aurait été en mesure de concevoir un mécanisme en se fondant uniquement sur les connaissances générales, sans avoir à consulter la littérature. Une recherche aurait toutefois permis de découvrir les
Rules for Ring Closure
(règles de fermeture de cycle), 1976, de Baldwin. Ces règles auraient révélé que le fait qu'un nucléophile et un groupe partant du même composé soient séparés par quatre carbones favorise la fermeture de cycle dans des conditions appropriées. Le diol serait donc privilégié. Des liaisons simples, doubles ou triples peuvent exister entre les atomes. Si tous les atomes dans un composé établissent des liaisons simples, le composé est dit complètement saturé. S'il existe des liaisons doubles ou triples entre certains atomes, le composé est dit non saturé. Même si les diagrammes dans l'article de Baldwin ne présentent pas de systèmes non saturés, le chimiste versé dans l'art - mais il appert que ce n'est pas le cas de M. Davies - ne conclurait pas que les règles s'appliquent uniquement aux systèmes complètement saturés.
[135]
Il y aurait une réaction SN2. Au paragraphe 172 de son rapport, il affirme [traduction] : « Le choix d'un groupe partant approprié et l'établissement de conditions basiques pour les réactions de déprotonation font partie du travail courant du chimiste versé dans l'art, ils ne demandent pas beaucoup de temps et ne sont pas non plus complexes. » Il a eu la possibilité d'examiner les notes de laboratoire de Lundbeck et a constaté que le réactif de Mosher (chlorure d'acide) était utilisé pour former des esters diastéréoisomères covalents du citalopram. Il n'a pas pensé que ce procédé était particulièrement inhabituel, puisqu'il existe une référence s'y rapportant dans l'un des articles de spécialistes de renom:
Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions
, 1981, par Jacques, Collet et Wilen.
[136]
M. Dannheiser était également d'avis que le dédoublement chimique serait la méthode privilégiée pour obtenir les énantiomères du citalopram. De ce fait, il a rejeté les autres procédés, tels que la synthèse asymétrique, la méthode du « réservoir chiral » et la séparation cinétique.
[137]
En 1988, le destinataire versé dans l'art aurait produit des diastéréosiomères covalents du diol précurseur, puis les aurait séparés les uns des autres par chromatographie. Une fois séparés, les diastéréoisomères auraient facilement pu être convertis en énantiomères du citalopram. À son avis, il s'agissait là d'un procédé chimique relativement aisé. Même si une séparation pouvait être réalisée par cristallisation, la chromatographie aurait mieux convenu, parce qu'elle aurait tiré davantage profit des différences entre les composés.
[138]
Le dédoublement chimique serait la méthode privilégiée, parce qu'un examen du citalopram montre que le composé présente un centre stéréogène. Il contient un cycle aromatique à six chaînons avec un fluor et une chaîne à trois atomes de carbone se terminant par un groupe diméthylamine. On reconnaîtrait que le composé contient les groupes fonctionnels suivants:
i. un groupe nitrate nitrile (c.-à-d. cyano);
ii. un groupe amine tertiaire;
iii. deux cycles aromatiques;
iv. un éther cyclique à cinq chaînons.
On constaterait que le composé contient un noyau phtalane ou dihydroisobenzofurane.
[139]
Le destinataire versé dans l'art aurait eu de fortes chances de succès en formant des diastéréoisomères du précurseur 1,4-diol par chromatographie ordinaire pour séparer ces diastéréoisomères puis les convertir en énantiomères du citalopram. Le diol serait retenu parce qu'il présente un groupe hydroxyle primaire pour la préparation de diastéréoisomères covalents et qu'il s'agit du principal groupe utilisé pour la formation des sels. La construction de l'éther cyclique à cinq chaînons avec un atome de carbone quaternaire (entièrement substitué) fixé à l'atome d'oxygène constituerait le principal défi.
[140]
La méthode la plus courante pour la synthèse de ces éthers fait appel à une réaction appelée « substitution nucléophile », dans laquelle un alcool joue le rôle du partenaire nucléophile. Au cours de cette réaction, le nucléophile remplace un groupe partant. Le groupe partant est un atome ou un groupe d'atomes, capable d'accepter la densité électronique de la liaison qui se brise durant une réaction de substitution ou d'élimination. Dans des conditions basiques, le chimiste versé dans l'art saurait qu'il est nécessaire de convertir un groupe hydroxyle en un groupe partant pour obtenir la cyclisation.
[141]
Une fois que les esters diastéréoisomériques auraient été séparés, on procéderait au clivage de l'ester pour obtenir les énantiomères diol. Cela n'aurait pas pour effet de compromettre le centre stéréogène et, par conséquent, il n'y aurait pas de racémisation. On peut avoir recours à diverses méthodes pour ce faire, notamment la saponification avec une base aqueuse ou la réduction au moyen d'un agent réducteur.
[142]
Le chimiste pourrait choisir parmi un éventail d'acides chiraux qui sont décrits dans la littérature et dont il est fait mention dans le livre de Jacques et autres
.
L'acide tartrique serait du nombre. Le chimiste choisirait des solvants tels que des alcools et se concentrerait sur les combinaisons d'acide chiral et de solvant qui ont permis d'obtenir des sels cristallins avec l'amine et il varierait les concentrations, la température et les quantités.
[143]
M. Davies avait une opinion divergente. Il a reconnu qu'il existait des différences plus ou moins prononcées entre les diastéréosomères sur le plan des propriétés physiques, et que ces composés pouvaient éventuellement être séparés par distillation, cristallisation ou chromatographie.
[144]
Il a décrit comme suit le citalopram: le centre de la molécule est un noyau dihydroisobenzofurane (aussi appelé structure phtalane). Fixé à ce noyau est le groupe -C N, qui est appelé nitrile ou cyano selon le contexte. Il y a aussi un cycle aromatique (benzène) avec un atome de fluor et, finalement, une chaîne de trois atomes de carbone se terminant par une amine tertiaire. Cela signifie que l'atome d'azote est lié aux trois atomes de carbone sans atome d'hydrogène. Il a ensuite examiné les éthers cycliques à cinq atomes et la conformation. Les paires d'électrons se repoussent, de sorte que la forme idéale des molécules plus complexes en est une qui réduit au minimum l'interaction des paires d'électrons sur les atomes adjacents ainsi qu'autour de tous les atomes individuels.
[145]
Il a ensuite abordé la question des nucléophiles et des électrophiles. Les nucléophiles sont riches en électrons et caractérisés par une seule paire d'électrons, c'est le cas par exemple de l'eau (H2O) et de l'ammoniac (NH3). Les électrophiles sont pauvres en électrons et ils sont aptes à former une nouvelle liaison covalente en utilisant une paire d'électrons qui leur est fournie par un autre atome ou une autre molécule. Ils sont porteurs soit d'une charge positive, soit d'une charge positive partielle. Une nouvelle liaison peut être formée lorsqu'un réactif nucléophile approche un réactif électrophile. À titre d'exemple, lorsque l'ammoniac et le chlorure d'hydrogène (HCl), deux gaz, entrent en réaction, on obtient du chlorure d'ammonium, un sel solide.
[146]
Il analyse ensuite les réactions de substitution nucléophile. Lorsqu'un nucléophile réagit avec un atome de carbone, une charge positive partielle se développe en raison de la liaison avec un atome ou un groupe d'atomes plus électronégatif. Il en résulte que l'atome électronégatif est perdu (groupe partant) et il est remplacé par le nucléophile. Il existe deux principaux mécanismes, appelés SN1 et SN2, qui jouent tous les deux un rôle dans les réactions de fermeture de cycle. SN1 est un processus en deux étapes. Au cours de la première étape, un groupe, le groupe partant, est perdu, ce qui donne un intermédiaire chargé positivement. Au cours de la deuxième étape, le nucléophile attaque l'intermédiaire d'un côté ou de l'autre, de sorte que si un seul énantiomère du produit de départ est utilisé, le remplacement par ce processus SN1 entraînera généralement la formation d'un mélange racémique.
[147]
La substitution SN2 est un processus qui ne compte qu'une seule étape. Le nucléophile doit attaquer l'atome de carbone central à un angle de 180 degrés par rapport au groupe partant, au même moment que celui-ci se détache. Lorsqu'on utilise un seul énantiomère de la matière de départ, la réaction SN2 forme un seul énantiomère du produit. Si l'on utilise un seul énantiomère d'un nucléophile chiral dans la réaction de substitution avec une matière de départ non chirale, le processus engendrera un seul énantiomère du produit, peu importe que la réaction suive un mécanisme SN1 ou SN2. Dans le cas d'une réaction SN2, la forme et l'orientation moléculaires sont importantes, car les diverses parties réactives doivent s'aligner correctement.
[148]
Selon lui, la différence entre les systèmes saturés et les systèmes non saturés est de la plus haute importance. Un système saturé en est un qui ne contient aucune liaison double carbone-carbone, tandis qu'un système non saturé contient de telles liaisons; les deux extrémités ne peuvent s'approcher facilement en raison de la rigidité de la forme entourant la liaison double.
[149]
La molécule de citalopram est une base, car elle contient un groupe amino. Cette base libre peut donc former un sel avec un acide.
[150]
À son avis, le fait d'effectuer une recension de la littérature en 1988 n'aurait pas été aussi usuel que l'ont laissé entendre MM. Semmelhack et Dannheiser, lesquels n'ont dans les faits pas effectué de recherches comme si l'on était en 1988. Si, aujourd'hui, on utiliserait un moteur de recherche sur Internet, comme SciFinder, à l'époque, on aurait plutôt utilisé des copies papier de
Chemical Abstract
. Dans le cas du citalopram, on aurait cherché des brevets et utilisé des mots clés comme « citalopram », « phtalane » et « isobenzofurane ». L'utilisation de termes plus généraux aurait ciblé beaucoup trop de documents, dont la majorité n'aurait pas été pertinente. La personne versée dans l'art chercherait également des méthodes de dédoublement précises, en utilisant des mots clés comme « énantiomères », « diastéréoisomères », « agents de dédoublement » et « CLHP chirale ». Ces recherches auraient exigé beaucoup de temps, et il aurait fallu se trouver dans une bibliothèque ou commander des documents d'autres bibliothèques. Pour effectuer une recherche exhaustive, il aurait fallu se rendre plusieurs fois dans une bibliothèque, ce qui se serait échelonné dans bien des cas sur plusieurs semaines.
[151]
En ce qui concerne les connaissances générales courantes, il était d'avis que l'on aurait eu recours à l'un des ouvrages de chimie les plus importants, à savoir la 5e édition de
Organic Chemistry
de Morrison et Boyd. Il a également mentionné trois ouvrages spécialisés, qu'il ne croyait pas qu'une personne versée dans l'art aurait eus à portée de la main. L'un de ces ouvrages est un livre de Jacques, Collet et Wilen, qu'il considérait comme étant très avancé. Il était surpris que M. Bøgesø l'ait consulté.
[152]
Il était d'avis que le dédoublement était un processus obscur et qu'il s'agissait d'une activité spéciale pour laquelle il fallait adopter une approche spéciale, comme le mentionnaient Morrison et Boyd.
[153]
La différence entre le concept d'innovation et l'état de la technique est que le brevet 452 vise une nouvelle substance utilisée comme antidépresseur. Les documents de l'art antérieur ne divulguaient pas cet énantiomère du citalopram et n'en permettaient pas la fabrication. En fait, cet énantiomère n'avait jamais été fabriqué auparavant. Ses propriétés n'avaient jamais été établies; elles étaient inconnues et inattendues. Le procédé divulgué était nouveau et original.
[154]
Contrairement à MM. Semmelhack et Dannheiser, il était d'avis que la personne versée dans l'art aurait d'abord tenté de dédoubler le citalopram, plutôt qu'un précurseur ou un dérivé de cette molécule, dont il y en avait plusieurs. Cependant, comme je l'ai mentionné précédemment, je crois qu'une personne voulant obtenir les énantiomères du citalopram aurait utilisé un composé donné et, en cas d'échec, en aurait utilisé un autre. Il est vrai, toutefois, que l'utilisation du diol implique une étape chimique additionnelle. La conversion du diol en citalopram nécessitait la fermeture du cycle de façon à produire un cycle phtalane à cinq chaînons contenant de l'oxygène, ce qui met en cause les mécanismes SN1 et SN2 ainsi que la réaction chimique à 180 degrés. Il existe certaines différences entre les systèmes saturés et les systèmes non saturés, ce qui l'a amené à discuter des règles de Baldwin.
[155]
En commentant le rapport de M. Dannheiser, il affirme que l'analyse en fonction des règles de Baldwin avait été fondée sur des systèmes saturés et ne tenait pas compte des difficultés d'ordre stéréoélectronique associées à l'état de transition observé dans des systèmes non saturés, comme dans le cas du citalopram. À son avis, les règles auraient pu faire l'objet d'un débat entre universitaires, mais elles n'auraient pas guidé une personne versée dans l'art en 1988. Il fait valoir que, selon lui, les règles de Baldwin ne s'appliquent qu'aux systèmes saturés, et qu'un lecteur averti n'en tiendrait pas compte étant donné que la fermeture du diol intermédiaire survenait dans un système non saturé, dont le citalopram est un exemple. Le diol de citalopram présentait une liaison double non saturée dans la chaîne de liaison et, par conséquent, ne faisait pas partie des molécules « préférentielles » citées par M. Baldwin.
[156]
La société Apotex a ainsi appelé Sir Jack Baldwin en réplique. Lundbeck a d'abord tenté de faire rejeter son rapport au motif qu'Apotex tentait d'entraver le processus. Je ne crois pas que c'était le cas. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'ai permis à Lundbeck, en guise de compromis, de rappeler M. Davies en surréplique, ce qu'elle n'a pas fait.
[157]
M. Baldwin a déclaré que, bien que les exemples utilisés dans ses règles aient été des systèmes saturés, une personne versée dans l'art saurait qu'elles s'appliquent également à des systèmes non saturés. Au cours des 25 années pendant lesquelles ils ont travaillé ensemble, M. Davies n'a jamais exprimé l'opinion qu'il a donnée en l'espèce. Mais surtout, au cours de ces 25 années, ni l'un ni l'autre n'a discuté ne serait-ce qu'une seule fois des règles de Baldwin! À mon avis, si des professeurs d'université peuvent discuter de ces règles en sirotant une tasse de thé, elles n'auraient en revanche pas traversé l'esprit d'un chimiste ordinaire et ne lui auraient pas permis de conclure que telle ou telle réaction allait de soi.
[158]
En effet, pour montrer que ses règles s'appliqueraient à la fois aux systèmes saturés et aux systèmes non saturés, M. Baldwin cite un article paru en 1989 qui portait sur le houblon du Japon. Il ne m'importe pas de savoir dans quelle mesure un chimiste médicinal « ordinaire », qui travaillait dans un laboratoire pharmaceutique après 1988, était lu. Bien que l'état postérieur de la technique puisse simplement confirmer une évidence, je ne conviens pas qu'une telle personne serait tombée sur cet article et que cela lui aurait donné l'idée, sans imagination, d'effectuer une réaction chimique plutôt qu'une autre.
[159]
Le « différend » entre MM. Dannheiser et Davies constitue un autre exemple du fait que les experts discutent à un niveau qui se situe bien au-delà de celui du destinataire du brevet versé dans l'art sans imagination, qui, bien sûr, ne l'aurait pas lu. Contrairement à M. Davies, M. Dannheiser était d'avis qu'un chimiste ordinaire aurait considéré, en 1988, qu'une fermeture de cycle de type SN2 aurait été une étape raisonnable dans la synthèse d'un énantiomère du citalopram.
[160]
À l'opposé, M. Davies croyait qu'un tel chimiste aurait connu les principes de la stéréochimie et aurait effectué une analyse conformationnelle, ce qui ne l'aurait pas amené à envisager une fermeture de cycle de type SN2. Dans son rapport en réplique, M. Dannheiser doute que ce destinataire versé dans l'art aurait eu une connaissance suffisamment avancée des principes de stéréochimie pour effectuer l'analyse mentionnée par M. Davies. Cependant, si ce chimiste avait eu ces connaissances, il aurait aussi envisagé ce que l'on appelle le principe de Curtain-Amath.
[161]
Cela a amené Lundbeck à proposer que M. Davies soit rappelé en surréplique. J'ai rejeté cette demande, car Lundbeck avait pleinement la possibilité de contre-interroger M. Dannheiser. Les propos que j'ai tenus dans mon ordonnance du 7 décembre 2013 demeurent vrais pour l'affaire dans son ensemble: [traduction] « Ainsi, la question clé est en fait de savoir ce que deux experts surqualifiés auraient pensé, en 2012, qu'un chimiste pharmaceutique ordinaire aurait pensé faire en 1988. »
iii. CLHP chirale
[162]
Les trois experts appelés sur ce point étaient MM. Beesley, Armstrong et Myers.
[163]
M. Myers a présenté un excellent aperçu de la chromatographie liquide haute performance (CLHP), tant de base (ou achirale) que chirale. La chromatographie liquide a été élaborée il y a un siècle par le botaniste russe Mikhail S. Tswett. Celui-ci avait séparé des composés formant les pigments présents dans les feuilles de plantes en utilisant un solvant dans une colonne remplie de particules, à savoir de la poudre de craie et de l'oxyde d'aluminium. Il a d'abord versé un extrait homogénéisé de feuilles de plantes dans la colonne, puis a ajouté un solvant pur. Au fur et à mesure que l'échantillon se déplaçait dans la colonne, des bandes de différentes couleurs se formaient, lesquelles correspondaient aux différents composés présents dans l'échantillon. La raison pour laquelle les composés s'étaient séparés ainsi est que les composés qui étaient davantage attirés par les particules étaient ralentis, alors que ceux qui étaient davantage attirés par le solvant se déplaçaient plus rapidement. Le terme « chromatographie » provient du grec
khrôma
, qui signifie couleur, et
graphein
, qui signifie écrire.
[164]
Ce que l'on appelle aujourd'hui la chromatographie liquide haute performance (CLHP) était d'abord appelé la chromatographie liquide haute pression en raison de la forte pression qu'il fallait utiliser pour générer le flux de solvant. Au début des années 1970, les pompes pouvaient produire des pressions d'environ 35 bars (atmosphères); de nos jours, les pompes les plus récentes peuvent générer des pressions atteignant 400 bars. Au fil du temps, on a continué d'améliorer les instruments, comme les injecteurs, les détecteurs et les colonnes.
[165]
La CLHP est une technique qui vise à séparer, à quantifier et à analyser les composants d'un mélange chimique. L'échantillon, un liquide, est injecté dans un solvant (que l'on appelle la phase mobile), lequel est poussé dans une colonne remplie de particules spécialisées (que l'on appelle la phase stationnaire) afin de permettre la séparation des composants du mélange. Les colonnes peuvent être de dimensions variables. Les pressions utilisées dépendent de la taille des particules qui se trouvent dans la colonne. De façon générale, plus les particules sont petites, plus il faut utiliser une pression élevée. L'on préfère généralement les petites particules, car elles permettent une meilleure séparation.
[166]
Les principales variables sont le pouvoir de séparation mécanique, tel que décrit, et le pouvoir de séparation chimique créé par un phénomène de compétition entre la phase stationnaire et la phase mobile. Quatre types d'interactions peuvent être utilisées pour effectuer une séparation par CLHP:
i. la polarité;
ii. la charge électrique;
iii. la taille moléculaire;
iv. la chiralité.
[167]
La phase mobile et la phase stationnaire ont une polarité différente. Dans le cas de l'huile et de l'eau, par exemple, l'huile est la phase stationnaire, non polaire, et l'eau est la phase mobile, polaire. Dans un tel cas, les composés polaires demeureraient dans la phase mobile (l'eau), tandis que les composés non polaires demeureraient dans la phase stationnaire (l'huile).
[168]
En ce qui concerne les colonnes de CLHP, y compris les colonnes de CLHP chirale, elles contenaient le plus souvent des particules de silice poreuses dans les années 1980. Depuis lors, le dimensionnement de ces particules s'est grandement amélioré, ce qui permet d'accroître la surface de la phase stationnaire. Les particules de silice sont naturellement polaires. Cependant, la forme la plus courante de CLHP est la CLHP en phase inverse, car les échantillons sont plus souvent des mélanges polaires. On se trouve à modifier la surface de la silice de façon à la rendre non polaire, par l'ajout de longues chaînes hydrocarbonées. On appelle cette modification un greffage. Les composés non polaires présents dans l'échantillon sont attirés par les chaînes hydrocarbonées greffées, ce qui les ralentit dans la colonne, tandis que les molécules polaires qui sont présentes dans l'échantillon traversent la colonne plus rapidement.
[169]
Selon M. Myers, la séparation chirale s'effectue par association diastéréoisomérique réversible entre un soluté énantiomérique et une phase stationnaire chirale qui est absorbée ou greffée sur une phase stationnaire.
[170]
En ce qui concerne M. Beesley, qui a témoigné avant M. Myers, je dois dire qu'il est un excellent vendeur.
[171]
Il a fait la promotion des produits d'Astec, et plus particulièrement des colonnes de cyclodextrine mises au point par M. Armstrong dans les années 1980. Il a fait des présentations pour diverses sociétés pharmaceutiques en Amérique du Nord et en Europe, ainsi que pour la FDA. Il a mis l'accent sur le fait que ces colonnes peuvent séparer les bêta-bloquants, les vasodilatateurs, les stéroïdes et les barbituriques. Diverses entreprises ont également retenu les services de M. Beesley pour les aider à dédoubler des médicaments racémiques. À son avis, le destinataire du brevet versé dans l'art connaîtrait les principes de la chromatographie et aurait une expérience dans le domaine. Il a souligné que, outre la CLHP chirale, il y avait d'autres moyens d'obtenir des énantiomères, y compris le dédoublement du citalopram ou de l'un de ses intermédiaires par la formation de diastéréoisomères. Il s'en est toutefois tenu à son domaine d'expertise, la CLHP, tout comme MM. Semmelhack et Dannheiser, qui n'avaient aucune expertise particulière dans le domaine de la CLHP.
[172]
M. Beesley était d'avis qu'un chimiste pharmaceutique ordinaire aurait choisi les phases stationnaires chirales de -cyclodextrine et de -cyclodextrine acétylée vendues au commerce par la société Astec dans le cadre de la série Cyclobond 1, ainsi que la colonne Chiralcel OD vendue par Daicel et J.T. Baker. Le chimiste en question aurait choisi ces colonnes plutôt que d'autres en raison des caractéristiques structurelles du citalopram.
[173]
Des expériences ont été menées pour le compte d'Apotex à Jackson, au Mississippi, et à Toronto sur une colonne de -cyclodextrine acétylée et sur une colonne Chiralcel OD, lesquelles expériences ont été couronnées de succès; il en sera davantage question ci-après. L'expérience menée au Mississippi l'a été par M. Timothy Ward, qui a préparé une phase stationnaire en liant de la -cyclodextrine acétylée à des particules de silice de 5 m. Il est à noter que M. Ward est professeur de chimie et qu'il avait été l'un des étudiants de M. Armstrong dans les années 1980, avec qui il a corédigé divers articles; M. Ward est un expert reconnu en ce qui concerne les cyclodextrines.
[174]
En 1988, une société pharmaceutique aurait eu au moins une colonne chirale, et plus vraisemblablement un certain nombre de telles colonnes, et elle aurait pu consulter Astec, J.T. Baker ou Daicel, ou encore un autre fabricant de colonnes, pour obtenir de l'aide le cas advenant qu'elle se heurte à des difficultés « imprévues ».
[175]
Tout comme M. Armstrong, M. Ward affirme que, à l'occasion, on demandait à la société Astec de mettre au point des méthodes chirales pour les sociétés pharmaceutiques ou de dédoubler leurs médicaments racémiques.
[176]
À l'époque, il y avait plus de 30 phases stationnaires chirales sur le marché. Un chimiste pharmaceutique ordinaire aurait su que la plupart d'entre elles n'auraient pas été appropriées étant donné la structure du composé. En fait, il en aurait rejeté 28 d'emblée, y compris les premières colonnes mises au point par un dénommé Pirkle. Je m'arrête ici pour souligner le fait que Lundbeck a consulté M. Pirkle, et que ce dernier a dit douter que ses colonnes puissent être utilisées pour dédoubler le citalopram.
[177]
Pour revenir à M. Myers, bien que des colonnes analytiques aient été disponibles en 1988, et même des colonnes semi-préparatives et des colonnes préparatives, qui auraient produit un meilleur rendement, il n'existait pas encore de pompes à haute pression et à haut débit, de sorte que la chromatographie préparative ne pouvait être réalisée qu'avec de grosses particules et qu'elle n'aurait pas permis d'obtenir des résultats intéressants en raison du faible pouvoir de séparation de ces particules.
[178]
En ce qui concerne le greffage avec les particules de silice, de nombreuses variables entrent en jeu, comme le type de solvant choisi, la température, le catalyseur, ainsi que le type et la fonction du groupe hydrocarboné greffé à la silice. Les fabricants ne divulguent pas les méthodes précises qu'ils utilisent pour des raisons de confidentialité.
[179]
Il était d'avis que la façon dont les particules de silice étaient introduites dans les colonnes en acier inoxydable était un processus obscur. Il y avait des différences quant au matériel, quant au type de colonne, quant aux solvants utilisés pour préparer la suspension et comprimer le gel dans la colonne de remplissage, quant à la pression, quant au débit et quant au solvant de lavage. Le « remplissage d'une colonne » est une tâche difficile, et il ne s'agit certainement pas d'une tâche à laquelle un chimiste ordinaire se serait adonné de façon régulière. D'importantes avancées ont été réalisées en ce qui concerne la taille des particules. Plus celles-ci sont petites, meilleurs sont les résultats. Dans les années 1970 et 1980, ces particules mesuraient habituellement cinq ou dix microns. Vers la fin des années 1980, on est passé à des particules de trois microns, mais ces particules ne pouvaient être utilisées dans des colonnes de CLHP, car on ne disposait pas de pompes pouvant générer une pression suffisamment élevée.
[180]
À son avis, le dédoublement du citalopram par chromatographie chirale avant juin 1988 n'était pas un choix évident et aurait peut-être même été impossible. En effet, la technologie évoluait si rapidement qu'il est difficile de déterminer exactement ce qui aurait pu être utilisé. Il y avait des changements dans les types de colonnes, la silice, le remplissage, les instruments, les raccords, les détecteurs, le système de pompage et les logiciels. Il est difficile de déterminer ce qui aurait été su et ce qui aurait pu être fait en juin 1988. Il met en question la raison pour laquelle M. Beesley a choisi la colonne de -cyclodextrine acétylée et la colonne Chiralcel OD, et suppose qu'il avait été influencé par de l'information
post factum
ou
a posteriori
. Ces deux colonnes n'étaient pas bien connues en juin 1988, et il ne comprend pas pourquoi le destinataire versé dans l'art les aurait choisies plutôt que d'autres colonnes. Bien sûr, il est possible que M. Beesley ait eu des connaissances précises sur ces colonnes, et en particulier sur les colonnes Cyclobond, car il avait participé à leur commercialisation. Si les colonnes Chiralcel OD étaient disponibles en juin 1988, ce fait n'était pas généralement connu des scientifiques.
[181]
M. Myers a également commenté les expériences réalisées pour le compte d'Apotex au Mississippi et à Toronto en 2012. Ces commentaires seront regroupés avec ceux des autres intervenants.
[182]
En ce qui concerne M. Armstrong, celui-ci avait effectué personnellement un grand nombre d'expériences, comme M. Beesley, et il avait utilisé de nombreuses techniques pour séparer des mélanges racémiques. Des clients se sont adressés à lui de façon indépendante, et en association avec Astec, pour lui demander de séparer des mélanges racémiques à l'aide de colonnes de CLHP chirale.
[183]
Dans son rapport, il décrit la CLHP chirale comme suit. Une solution homogène d'un racémique est injectée à l'extrémité supérieure d'une colonne. Les composés se dirigent vers le bas à des vitesses différentes, au gré de leurs interactions avec la phase stationnaire. Les matières qui sortent de la colonne passent dans un détecteur, qui émet un signal proportionnel à la concentration mesurée dans la phase mobile. Ce signal est enregistré et est utilisé pour tracer un graphique que l'on appelle un chromatogramme.
[184]
Contrairement à M. Beesley, il ne croit pas qu'un chimiste ordinaire aurait pu dédoubler le citalopram en l'espace de quelques jours. Des scientifiques de diverses sociétés pharmaceutiques s'adressaient à lui pour qu'il les aide à séparer des mélanges racémiques après qu'ils eurent passé au moins un an à tenter de le faire eux-mêmes, sans succès.
[185]
À son avis, il n'était pas évident d'obtenir du citalopram et des sels d'addition acide non toxiques par CLHP chirale, car le citalopram est un composé qui contient des amines chirales. On aurait d'abord tenté une réaction avec des acides chiraux pour former des sels diastéréoisomériques. Ces sels seraient plus faciles à séparer par des moyens classiques et dans des quantités préparatoires, ce que Lundbeck a tenté de faire.
[186]
Même s'il était possible que la CLHP chirale fonctionne, cette technique n'était pas suffisamment prometteuse pour que l'on puisse dire qu'il était évident ou apparent qu'elle le serait. Le fait que l'on s'en soit servi pour séparer d'autres racémiques ne signifie pas qu'elle pourrait être utilisée pour dédoubler le citalopram, et plus particulièrement pour obtenir les quantités nécessaires. Les colonnes chirales semi-préparatives ou préparatives étaient rarement utilisées à l'époque et n'étaient pas souvent disponibles.
[187]
La -cyclodextrine acétylée n'était disponible qu'en des dimensions utiles à des fins analytiques, et elle n'aurait pas été retenue par un chimiste ordinaire. Il croyait également qu'il n'aurait pas été possible de se procurer la colonne Chiralcel OD dans le commerce, ou alors, s'il avait été possible de se la procurer, il se serait agi d'un produit si nouveau que ce n'aurait pas été un choix évident.
[188]
Malgré le fait qu'un chimiste ordinaire aurait été au fait de l'existence de colonnes de CLHP chirale et aurait su que ces colonnes pouvaient être utilisées pour séparer des composés à une échelle analytique, il aurait eu peu d'expérience, voire aucune. Lui-même, considéré comme un expert à l'époque, n'avait jamais utilisé de colonnes chirales semi-préparatives ou préparatives.
[189]
La CLHP chirale n'aurait pas été son premier choix pour le dédoublement du citalopram. Il aurait cru que la cristallisation fractionnée aurait fonctionné. Cependant, pour recourir à la CLHP chirale, il faudrait choisir le type de colonne chirale puis déterminer les conditions adéquates, comme la phase mobile, le débit, le pH, la température, etc., et l'on disposait de peu d'information à ce sujet à l'époque. En 1987, il a rédigé un article dans lequel il affirmait que le dédoublement des énantiomères était l'un des problèmes les plus difficiles de la science de la séparation, et qu'il s'agissait d'un domaine à explorer. Au moins 35 colonnes étaient disponibles à l'époque, et il aurait retenu les suivantes:
a. colonnes à base d' 1-glycoprotéine acide (AGB);
b. colonnes à base de cyclodextrine;
c. colonnes à phase stationnaire chirale avec complexe-pi, dont celles mises au point par M. Pirkle. Il était d'avis que les probabilités de réussite n'étaient pas élevées, mais qu'il aurait été normal de les essayer, car ce sont les colonnes sur lesquelles on a le plus écrit et sur lesquelles on a écrit le plus longtemps;
d. colonnes à phase stationnaire chirale cellulosique.
[190]
En fait, Lundbeck avait commandé des travaux sur une colonne à base d' 1-glycoprotéine acide, le principal type de colonne utilisé pour séparer deux amines chirales, mais cela n'a pas fonctionné avec le citalopram.
[191]
Nonobstant le fait qu'il ait participé à la mise au point de la colonne à base de -cyclodextrine acétylée privilégiée par M. Beesley, ce type de colonne était peu connu à l'époque. Lui-même ne savait à quoi s'attendre. La seule séparation mentionnée dans la littérature concernait un autre composé qui n'était pas une amine et qui ne présentait aucune similitude avec le citalopram.
[192]
On savait, en 1988, que même une infime différence dans une partie d'une molécule pouvait faire en sorte que l'on obtienne des résultats différents. On le mentionne d'ailleurs dans un rapport qu'il a corédigé avec M. Ward et d'autres collaborateurs pour la revue
Analytical Chemistry
, intitulé: « An Enantiomeric Resolution and Chiral Recognition of Racemic Nicotine and Nicotine Analogues by -Cyclodextrin Complexation. Structure-Enantiomeric Resolution Relationships in Host-Guest Interactions ».
[193]
Le manuel « Cyclobond Handbook » que mentionne M. Beesley n'avait pas encore été publié en 1987. En Effet, ce manuel ne pouvait avoir été publié avant la fin de 1988, car on y cite des articles parus vers la fin de cette année.
[194]
Même si les colonnes Chiralcel OD étaient disponibles en juin 1988, et il n'est pas convaincu qu'elles l'étaient avant 1989, ces colonnes auraient été si nouvelles qu'elles n'auraient pas fait partie des connaissances générales courantes d'un chimiste analytique versé dans l'art. À cette époque, ce type de colonne n'avait été utilisé que pour séparer des bêta-bloquants et d'autres colonnes étaient également utilisées à cette fin. Ce n'est que dans les années 1990 que les colonnes Chiralcel OD ont été considérées comme étant parmi les colonnes les plus polyvalentes, et elles le sont toujours aujourd'hui. En effet, lors de la première séance de formation abrégée sur la séparation chirale, tenue à Bradford, en Angleterre, en mars 1988, il a été très peu question de la colonne Chiralcel OD.
[195]
Pour résumer son opinion, il n'était pas du tout évident d'employer une colonne de CLHP ni que cela produirait des résultats.
iv. Les expériences
[196]
Apotex a invité Lundbeck à assister à l'expérience de juin 2012 à Jackson, au Mississippi. La société Apotex avait retenu les services de M. Timothy Ward pour le dédoublement du citalopram par CLHP chirale, et plus particulièrement avec de la -cyclodextrine acétylée. M. Ward avait fait appel à un dénommé Smuts pour le remplissage des colonnes. Les colonnes utilisées n'étaient pas celles qui existaient en 1988. En fait, il y a eu une vive controverse au sujet de la question de savoir si M. Ward s'était fondé sur un brevet de M. Armstrong déposé en 1984 ou sur un protocole élaboré par Astec après 1988. Je considère qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de s'attarder à ces questions de crédibilité, car je ne suis pas convaincu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que l'expérience, qui a été couronnée de succès, démontre que l'on serait parvenu au même résultat en 1988, ne serait-ce que parce que le gel de silice utilisé dans la phase stationnaire n'était pas le même gel de silice qui était disponible à l'époque. Cet élément a eu un effet considérable sur l'efficacité et la sélectivité de colonne.
[197]
J'accepte la preuve présentée par M. Myers, qui, malgré un contre-interrogatoire serré, n'a pas du tout été ébranlé. Le brevet de M. Armstrong mentionnait le produit Spherisorb, vendu par la société de M. Myers. Ce produit n'était pas disponible l'année passée, alors on a utilisé le produit Nucleosil. Selon M. Beesley, il s'agissait d'un produit de rechange acceptable. Or, comme l'a souligné M. Myers, ces deux types de silice ont des caractéristiques très différentes, notamment en ce qui concerne la taille des pores, le volume des pores, la surface et la teneur en sodium. Par conséquent, le greffage se fait de façon très différente. De plus, on avait utilisé un système de CLHP moderne pour l'expérience effectuée au Mississippi. Il en résulte donc que l'efficacité du dédoublement serait accrue.
[198]
M. Armstrong précise également que le type de silice utilisé était différent de celui dont on se serait servi en 1988 et que M. Ward n'avait pas effectué la synthèse de la façon dont elle était décrite dans son brevet et de la façon dont elle aurait été effectuée en 1988. La cyclodextrine préparée par M. Ward n'aurait pas eu la même stabilité et la même sélectivité que la version qui était offerte sur le marché en 1988.
[199]
La société Apotex a commandé une deuxième expérience, laquelle a été réalisée à Toronto par M. Mark Taylor en juillet 2012, avec une colonne Chiralcel OD. L'expérience a été couronnée de succès, mais je considère toujours que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, cela ne reflète pas fidèlement les résultats d'une expérience qui aurait été menée à l'aide d'une telle colonne, en supposant qu'elle eut été disponible, avant juin 1988.
[200]
La provenance de la colonne est très insatisfaisante. La colonne avait été fournie aux avocats d'Apotex par M. William John Lough de l'Université de Sunderland. Ce dernier a comparu en qualité de témoin des faits. Il a travaillé à la société Beecham Pharmaceuticals de 1980 à 1988. Il a ensuite décidé de faire carrière dans le milieu universitaire et occupe un poste à l'Université de Sunderland depuis ce moment. Il a cependant gardé contact avec la société Beecham, et il dirigeait un programme de placement industriel destiné aux étudiants. L'un de ces étudiants, Amjad Khan, s'est joint à l'entité qui portait à l'époque le nom de SmithKline Beecham. À un certain moment, peut-être vers 2001, M. Khan lui a remis une colonne Chiralcel OD. L'étiquette métallique apposée sur la colonne portait la mention « Été 1992 ». M. Lough ne peut préciser ce que contenait la colonne, et nul ne le sait puisqu'elle n'a jamais été désassemblée. Elle est demeurée dans un tiroir pendant de nombreuses années.
[201]
Outre le fait que M. Taylor a obtenu de meilleurs résultats que ceux publiés en 1995 par M. Rochat, l'un des plus éminents chercheurs dans le domaine, les colonnes de CLHP, comme le mentionne M. Myers, vieillissent mal. Des vides se créent au fil du temps et, même si elles sont habituellement conservées dans un solvant adéquat, celui-ci finit par s'évaporer, ce qui provoque l'assèchement de la couche de silice et cause un certain déplacement, qui, à son tour, accentue la formation de vides et réduit l'efficacité des colonnes.
[202]
Si l'on suppose que les colonnes Chiralcel OD ont été fabriquées en 1992, étant donné que nous ne disposons d'aucun élément de preuve relativement à la date de leur fabrication, celles-ci ont connu d'importants changements entre 1988 et 1992, selon M. Armstrong. Les particules de silice, les prétraitements auxquels étaient soumises les particules de silice, les agents chiraux et les additifs étaient constamment améliorés. La sélectivité des colonnes Chiralcel OD enduites varie souvent en fonction du temps ou de l'utilisation qui en est faite, peut-être en raison de l'altération de la structure secondaire du polymère chiral et/ou en raison de la dégradation du sélecteur chiral dont elles sont enduites au fil du temps. Qui plus est, les conditions utilisées par M. Taylor avaient été publiées dans un article rédigé par M. Krstulovic en octobre 1988, c'est-à-dire après l'invention.
v. Les efforts de Lundbeck
[203]
Lundbeck a été soumise à un interrogatoire préalable approfondi, et a appelé un certain nombre de témoins au procès. La difficulté ou la facilité avec laquelle les inventeurs ont obtenu le résultat recherché n'est qu'un facteur secondaire lorsqu'il s'agit d'établir si la prétendue invention était ou non évidente.
[204]
L'un des inventeurs, M. Bøgesø, a expliqué dans le détail les épreuves que Lundbeck a rencontrées pendant huit ans. Il s'agissait toutefois de travaux intermittents puisque Lundbeck avait d'autres projets à mener. Divers procédés et produits chimiques ont été appliqués au citalopram et à son diol avant d'arriver à accomplir la séparation. La CLHP chirale a également été utilisée sans succès. Des consultants externes ont été appelés à la rescousse.
[205]
M. Bøgesø est seulement l'un des deux inventeurs nommés dans le brevet. L'autre est Jens Perregaard. Bien que ses notes de laboratoire aient été produites, il n'a pas été appelé comme témoin. Apotex prétend qu'il faut en tirer une inférence défavorable, et que sa déposition n'aurait pas aidé la cause de Lundbeck.
[206]
Je ne suis pas disposé à faire cette inférence. D'après la preuve, M. Perregaard a quitté Lundbeck il y a des années et ne se rapporte plus à cette compagnie. Du reste, même si l'on peut affirmer qu'il a dédoublé le citalopram sans difficulté, cela ne prouve pas que la démarche aurait été évidente pour la personne versée dans l'art. Comme le faisait remarquer le juge Hugessen dans
Beloit:
les inventeurs sont, par nature, inventifs.
[207]
Comme l'ont estimé les tribunaux, les tentatives de Lundbeck ne sont qu'un facteur secondaire, dont le poids est neutre en l'espèce. Certains prétendent que le (+)-citalopram aurait été obtenu plus tôt n'eût été un préjugé de M. Bøgesø à l'encontre du précurseur. Quand bien même il en serait ainsi, peu importe la date de sa réalisation, l'invention était alors évidente ou ne l'était pas. Si elle avait pu être réalisée plus tôt, cette invention aurait été antérieure aux avancées en matière de CLHP chirale invoquées par Apotex.
vi. Mosaïque d'antériorités
[208]
Beaucoup de temps et d'efforts ont été consacrés à la recherche de publications. Aucun chimiste en 1988 n'aurait eu la motivation d'écumer ce qu'une douzaine d'avocats et de para-juristes armés d'ordinateurs ont produit tout au long du procès; des centaines d'articles, littéralement, ont été présentés en vue d'établir que le (+)-citalopram était évident ou ne l'était pas.
[209]
Même en admettant qu'elle ait tout lu, la personne versée dans l'art devait encore en saisir le contenu.
[210]
Comme l'a déclaré la juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 241, [2008] ACF no 1094 (QL), au paragraphe 254:
Comme l'a reconnu Servier, il est possible de réunir une mosaïque de réalisations antérieures afin de faire en sorte qu'une revendication soit évidente. On suppose que même des techniciens non inventifs versés dans l'art lisent différentes revues professionnelles, participent à différents congrès et appliquent les enseignements tirés d'une source à un autre contexte ou qu'ils combineraient même les sources. Toutefois, ce faisant, la partie faisant valoir l'évidence doit être en mesure de montrer non seulement l'existence de réalisations antérieures, mais aussi la manière dont la personne normalement versée dans l'art aurait été amenée à combiner les éléments pertinents provenant de la mosaïque des réalisations antérieures. La présente affaire est un bon exemple. Apotex demande à la Cour de conclure qu'une personne normalement versée dans l'art, sans esprit inventif ou original, pourrait colliger une quantité relativement importante de connaissances précises provenant d'une longue liste de réalisations antérieures sur les inhibiteurs de l'ECA (et même certaines sources à l'extérieur du domaine de l'inhibition de l'ECA), formuler certains postulats fondamentaux et combiner ces connaissances pour arriver à une molécule de perindopril.
[211]
Comme l'a ensuite fait observer le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 158, [2010] ACF no 46 (QL), au paragraphe 84, la partie revendiquant l'évidence doit être en mesure de démontrer non seulement l'existence des antériorités, mais aussi comment la personne versée dans l'art aurait été amenée à combiner les éléments pertinents de cette mosaïque. Voir également la décision de la juge Gauthier, maintenant juge à la Cour d'appel fédérale, dans
Eli Lilly and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 1, [2009] ACF no 1229 (QL), à partir du paragraphe 416.
[212]
Je suis arrivé à la conclusion que l'invention n'était pas évidente. Pour reprendre l'approche adoptée par la Cour suprême dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la personne fictive versée dans l'art de même que ses connaissances usuelles courantes ont été décrites tout au long des présents motifs. Le concept innovateur de la revendication était une substance efficace comme antidépresseur, le (+)-citalopram, qui jusque-là n'avait jamais été créée. Les antériorités n'expliquaient pas comment l'obtenir et ne divulguaient pas les caractéristiques des deux énantiomères. Ces différences constituaient des étapes qui n'auraient pas été évidentes pour la personne versée dans l'art puisqu'elles nécessitaient un certain degré d'invention. Il n'allait pas plus ou moins de soi que les tentatives seraient fructueuses.
[213]
Le dédoublement chimique donnait lieu à beaucoup trop de permutations et de combinaisons. Le problème clé était le maintien de la chiralité. Le cycle devait être rompu puis reformé avec des composantes différentes. Cela a donné lieu à un vif débat sur la fermeture de cycles par une réaction de type SN1 et par une réaction de type SN2. Il est une chose de théoriser, comme l'ont fait MM. Semmelhack et Dannheiser, et d'avancer que les travaux pouvaient se faire facilement, mais il en est une autre de mener à bien ce type d'expérience en laboratoire. Par exemple, en ce qui concerne la cristallisation fractionnée - un procédé qui a suscité un certain doute chez MM. Semmelhack et Dannheiser mais qui a été la première technique qui soit venue à l'esprit de M. Armstrong -, MM. Semmehack, Davies et Bøgesø ont tous fait valoir qu'une simple égratignure sur la paroi du flacon dans lequel se produisait la réaction pouvait engendrer des résultats différents. M. Semmelhack a également indiqué qu'il était possible de réduire la température, de faire évaporer le solvant, d'utiliser un solvant moins puissant pour réduire la solubilité ou de changer le pH.
[214] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Plavix
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2008] ACS no 63 (QL)), au paragraphe 65, le juge Rothstein déclarait: « J'estime que la notion d'"essai allant de soi" n'est applicable que lorsqu'il est très clair ou, pour reprendre les termes employés par le lord juge Jacob, qu'il est plus ou moins évident, que l'essai sera fructueux. » Je suis d'avis qu'il n'allait pas de soi qu'une réaction chimique particulière fonctionnerait.
[215]
En ce qui concerne la CLHP chirale, je crois que le choix d'une colonne de -cyclodextrine acétylée ou d'une colonne Chiralcel OD par M. Beesley dépassait les connaissances générales courantes de l'époque. Qui plus est, compte tenu du grand nombre de variables évoquées dans la preuve présentée par MM. Armstrong et Myers, il n'était pas évident que l'expérience aurait porté fruit si l'on avait utilisé une colonne de CLHP.
[216]
Le
Oxford English Dictionary
définit le terme «
obvious
» ( « évident »), tiré du latin
ob via
, ou [traduction] « sur le chemin », notamment comme suit: [traduction] « qui vient ou se présente naturellement à l'œil ou l'esprit, qui est clairement perceptible, parfaitement évident ou manifeste; tangible. » [traduction] « [L'] évidence » est [traduction] « la qualité ou le caractère de qui est exposé ou donné (aux sens), ce qui est clairement perceptible. »
[217]
À mon avis, un rassemblement de publications qui auraient pu, et j'insiste sur « auraient pu », aboutir au (+)-citalopram, supposait un degré considérable d'inventivité.
[218]
Après réflexion, l'extrait suivant du rapport de M. Davies me paraît refléter fidèlement ma propre opinion (paragraphe 364):
[traduction] Par conséquent, je ne crois pas que la personne versée dans l'art qui aurait essayé de produire les énantiomères individuels du citalopram en 1988 aurait réussi. Un grand nombre d'expériences, beaucoup de travail et pas mal de chance auraient été nécessaires. Ni les différentes techniques que cette personne pouvait employer, ni celles qui ont effectivement permis d'obtenir le (+)-citalopram n'étaient très claires ou très courantes. Il n'allait certainement pas de soi que l'une de ces techniques fonctionnerait. Je pense que le seul nombre d'avenues possibles et la découverte finale d'une voie inattendue montrent clairement que l'invention n'était pas évidente. Échafauder à rebours, en s'aidant d'éléments disparates de concepts connus, revient à tomber dans le piège familier de la rétrospection. [...]
C. Inutilité
[219]
Apotex allègue que le sel résultant de l'addition d'acide pamoïque au (+)-citalopram est toxique. Comme telles, les revendications 1 à 5 englobent toutes ce sel. Par conséquent, il s'ensuit que le brevet est invalidé pour cause d'inutilité.
[220]
Le fondement sur lequel repose l'allégation d'Apotex est une demande de brevet internationale déposée par Lundbeck en 2004, portant le numéro de publication international WO 2004/05671 A 1. Cette demande, qui concerne l'hydrobromure de (+)-citalopram ainsi qu'une méthode de préparation, mentionnait notamment ce qui suit:
[traduction] La présente demande décrit également la base libre de l'escitalopram sous forme d'huile, le sel d'acide oxalique, ainsi que le sel résultant de l'addition d'acide pamoïque et de l'addition d'acide L- « + » tartrique à l'escitalopram. Étant donné la toxicité des sels formés par l'addition d'acide pamoïque, il ne convient pas de s'en servir dans des préparations pharmaceutiques.
[221]
Apotex soutient qu'il s'agit là d'une admission contraignante. À mon avis, la question n'est pas de savoir ce que Lundbeck a affirmé en 2004, mais plutôt de savoir si le sel d'acide pamoïque du (+)-citalopram est toxique ou non.
[222]
Apotex n'a pour ainsi dire présenté aucune preuve à cet effet. M. Jenner a mentionné la demande de 2004 dans son rapport, mais il a admis qu'il ne savait pas si le sel d'acide pamoïque du (+)-citalopram était toxique. Étonnement, Mme Helle Northeved, toxicologue chez Lundbeck, a affirmé que la société n'avait jamais testé ce sel jusqu'au présent litige.
[223]
Lundbeck a déposé le rapport d'expert du Dr Gerd Bode. Son rapport est accepté tel que lu, sans contre-interrogatoire. Selon ce rapport, le sel en question n'est pas toxique chez le rat. De plus, le rapport de M. Davies indique que plusieurs médicaments approuvés par Santé Canada et la FDA contiennent des sels d'acide pamoïque.
[224]
La preuve produite par Lundbeck n'est pas parfaite, mais elle est supérieure à celle d'Apotex, qui est inexistante. Comme l'a indiqué la Cour suprême dans
Whirlpool
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 9 CPR (4th) 129, [2000] ACS no 68 (QL)), il n'est pas déraisonnable qu'un tribunal accepte la preuve sommaire d'une partie lorsque l'autre n'en a aucune à présenter. Presque tous les excès sont nocifs. L'allégation est rejetée.
D. Divulgation insuffisante
[225]
Le mémoire descriptif révèle que [traduction] « les résultats de l'administration à des êtres humains ont été très satisfaisants ». Cette déclaration est inexacte puisque les énantiomères n'ont été testés sur les humains qu'après le dépôt de la demande de brevet en juin 1989. Apotex soutient que le brevet doit donc être déclaré nul. Le paragraphe 27(3) de la Loi, dans sa version alors en vigueur, prévoyait que « Le mémoire descriptif doit:
a
) décrire d'une façon exacte et complète l'invention et son application ou exploitation, telles que les a conçues son inventeur [...] ».
[226]
Cette disposition doit être mise en opposition avec le paragraphe 53(1) qui prévoyait qu'un brevet était frappé de nullité si « quelque allégation importante [...] n'est pas conforme à la vérité [...] et [...] l'omission ou l'addition est volontairement faite pour induire en erreur. »
[227]
Apotex a invoqué les deux dispositions dans l'instance relative à l'avis de conformité. Réflexion faite, je les ai regroupées puisque j'ai dit au paragraphe 147 que « je considère que la phrase précitée n'a induit personne en erreur. En outre, il n'y a aucune preuve d'une tentative d'induire en erreur. »
[228]
Le juge Noël a déclaré en appel, aux paragraphes 117 et 188:
[117] Apotex fait également valoir que les renseignements divulgués dans le brevet 452 sont insuffisants, parce que l'énoncé suivant conduit à une fausse piste (Motifs, paragraphe 147): [traduction] « les résultats de l'administration à des êtres humains ont été très satisfaisants ». Le juge de première instance a convenu que cet énoncé était faux, car, à l'époque pertinente, l'escitalopram n'avait pas encore été administré à des êtres humains. Cependant, il a décidé que (
ibidem
): « compte tenu que le brevet comporte deux pages entières d'évaluation de l'escitalopram chez des rongeurs ainsi qu'un tableau de résultats d'essais pharmacologiques, je considère que la phrase précitée n'a induit personne en erreur. En outre, il n'y a aucune preuve d'une tentative d'induire en erreur ». Je ne vois aucune raison de modifier cette conclusion.
[118] Apotex réplique néanmoins que cette conclusion ne règle pas son allégation selon laquelle l'invention n'a pas été décrite correctement, de sorte qu'elle va à l'encontre de l'article 4 de la
Loi sur les brevets
. À mon humble avis, il était loisible au juge de première instance de conclure que, étant donné que personne n'a été induit en erreur, l'invention a été décrite correctement.
[229]
Dans la présente action, Apotex n'invoque pas l'article 53 mais plaide de nouveau une divulgation insuffisante au titre de l'article 27. L'instance relative à l'avis de conformité doit être réexaminée à la lumière de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACS no 60 (QL), rendu en novembre dernier, dans lequel la Cour suprême a déclaré que les articles 27 et 53 étaient distincts. Le brevet de Pfizer lié au Viagra a été frappé de nullité pour divulgation insuffisante, bien que l'article 53 n'ait pas été invoqué, comme dans notre affaire. Néanmoins, la divulgation était lacunaire et le brevet a été annulé. Apotex soutient que je dois en faire autant dans la présente affaire.
[230]
Les deux experts appelés par Apotex pour s'exprimer sur ce point n'ont certainement pas été induits en erreur. M. Jenner a estimé qu'un pharmacologue comprendrait que toutes les expériences étaient décrites dans le brevet 452. Comme aucune ne concernait l'humain, il a estimé que l'affirmation relevait de la prédiction plutôt que des faits.
[231]
M. Levy s'est montré plus précis. À son avis, compte tenu des renseignements divulgués dans le brevet, la personne versée dans l'art aurait compris que la puissance optimale du (+)-citalopram n'avait pas été démontrée mais seulement prédite. Il s'est demandé si la prédiction impliquait que le (+)-citalopram était plus puissant que le citalopram, ce qu'il ne considérait pas comme une prédiction valable. J'aborderai son opinion lorsqu'il sera question de la prédiction valable.
[232]
À mon avis, l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne s'applique pas en l'espèce. Pfizer a revendiqué 260 trillions (1018) de composés pour le traitement du dysfonctionnement érectile chez les hommes impuissants. Le projet ne divulguait pas que le composé qui présentait une activité réelle était le sildénafil et que les autres composés ne présentaient aucune efficacité. Il s'agissait d'une affaire de type « aiguille dans une botte de foin ».
[233]
Après l'examen de la contrepartie donnée en échange du brevet, et en considérant qu'une divulgation adéquate est une précondition à l'obtention d'un brevet, le juge Lebel a affirmé, au paragraphe 72, que « [...] l'invention consiste dans l'utilisation du sildénafil pour le traitement de la DÉ, ce qu'il faut divulguer pour satisfaire aux exigences du par. 27(3) de la Loi », et au paragraphe 76, que « Pfizer disposait des données nécessaires pour préciser quel était le composé efficace, mais elle s'en est abstenue ».
[234]
Malgré des revendications en cascades qui se résumaient à dévoiler le sildénafil comme l'un des deux composés, le juge Lebel a ajouté, au paragraphe 80:
En l'espèce, toutefois, il y a atteinte au droit du public à une divulgation suffisante, car deux composés individuels sont revendiqués en dernier lieu, ce qui brouille l'identité véritable de l'invention. La divulgation ne précise pas en termes clairs quelle est l'invention. Pfizer obtient l'avantage prévu par la Loi - le monopole - sans s'acquitter de l'obligation de divulgation que lui impose la Loi. On ne saurait ni au plan des principes ni sous l'angle de la juste interprétation des lois permettre au breveté de se « jouer » ainsi du régime légal. Là réside à mon sens la question fondamentale que soulève le présent pourvoi, et celle-ci doit être tranchée au détriment de Pfizer.
Il a déclaré le brevet nul, même si l'appel se rapportait à une demande relevant du Règlement MB (AC). On avait supposé que la seule question soulevée par ces demandes était de déterminer s'il fallait interdire au ministre de la Santé de délivrer un avis de conformité. Pfizer a demandé à la Cour suprême de réexaminer la question.
[235]
En l'espèce, l'invention, le (+)-citalopram et la manière de l'obtenir, ont fait l'objet d'une divulgation adéquate. En fait, nonobstant sa divulgation, le (-)-citalopram n'a pas été revendiqué. Il me semble que l'interprétation du brevet nous donne la réponse. Comme l'enseignent des arrêts tels que
Free World Trust
, précité, l'interprétation doit être téléologique et éclairée. Il s'agit notamment de séparer l'essentiel de ce qui ne l'est pas. Même si la personne versée dans l'art est utile pour le déchiffrer (
Whirlpool
, au paragraphe 45), le brevet doit néanmoins satisfaire à la définition du « règlement » prévue par la
Loi d'interprétation
et se lire de manière à ce que ses objets puissent être réalisés. Comme je l'ai déjà indiqué, « l'interprétation des revendications est une question de droit qu'il appartient au juge de trancher, et celui-ci avait parfaitement le droit de donner aux revendications une interprétation différente de celle préconisée par les parties » (
Whirlpool
, au paragraphe 61).
[236]
Bien que la Cour ait besoin de la personne versée dans l'art pour appréhender les notions de racémates et d'énantiomères, et pour comprendre ce qu'est réellement le citalopram, son utilité a ses limites.
[237]
La phrase: [traduction] « Les résultats de l'administration à des êtres humains ont été très satisfaisants » n'est pas technique. Je conclus sans hésiter qu'elle n'est pas essentielle, et que le brevet peut être maintenu. Quoi qu'il en soit, si j'avais besoin d'aide, ni M. Jenner ni M. Levy n'ont déduit à la lecture du brevet que les énantiomères avaient réellement été testés chez l'humain.
[238]
Dépendamment de l'issue de la demande présentée par Pfizer visant à faire la Cour suprême du Canada réexaminer <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il est fort possible qu'Apotex ne puisse même pas soulever cet argument précis. Plus récemment, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 81, [2012] ACF no 1426 (QL), une action en invalidation concernant le même brevet lié au Viagra, le juge Zinn a fait droit à la requête d'Apotex visant à obtenir un jugement sommaire, sur la foi de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> de la Cour suprême. Cette décision est actuellement examinée en appel. L'interprétation des brevets est une question de droit, il se peut donc très bien qu'Apotex soit liée par l'interprétation que j'ai donnée du brevet 452, et qui a été confirmée par la Cour d'appel.
Revendication no 7 du brevet
[239]
L'autre allégation de divulgation insuffisante concerne la revendication no 7 du brevet, rédigée comme suit:
[traduction] Une méthode pour la préparation de (+)-1-(3-diméthylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophényl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofurane-5-carbonitrile, laquelle comprend une étape consistant à dédoubler les deux énantiomères d'un composé de la formule générale suivante:
[diagramme omis]
où R' est un atome d'hydrogène ou un groupement ester labile, auquel cas on obtient l'énantiomère (+)-1-(3-diméthylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophényl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofurane-5-carbonitrile, lequel énantiomère est ensuite cyclisé après traitement avec une base, ou, si R' est un atome d'hydrogène, avec une base en présence d'un dérivé acide permettant de produire un ester labile, puis en isolant le (+)-1-(3-diméthylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophényl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzo-furane-5-carbonitrile comme tel, ou sous la forme d'un sel d'addition acide non toxique.
[240]
Apotex allègue que le procédé décrit à la revendication no 7 n'indique pas de manière précise lequel des énantiomères dédoublés produit le (+)-citalopram, ni les étapes à suivre pour obtenir l'énantiomère qui produit le (+)-citalopram. Apotex allègue que Lundbeck est prise à son propre piège. S'il faut effectuer certains essais pour réaliser l'invention, ces mêmes essais auraient permis au destinataire versé dans l'art d'obtenir du (+)-citalopram. Cependant, à mon avis, il existe une importante différence entre le fait d'effectuer des essais en ayant le brevet en main et le fait d'effectuer des essais sans l'avoir en main. Comme l'a souligné M. Davies, l'un des énantiomères produisant le (+)-citalopram est utilisé dans le reste de la méthode décrite. Une personne versée dans l'art saurait que l'ester pourrait être la forme (+) ou la forme (-). Je juge que la revendication no 7 n'est pas frappée d'invalidité pour divulgation insuffisante.
E. Prédiction valable
[241]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  marcher, et non celle de le démontrer réellement. La règle de la prédiction valable comporte trois éléments:
i. la prédiction doit avoir un fondement factuel;
ii. l'inventeur doit avoir un raisonnement clair et « valable » qui permette d'inférer du fondement factuel le résultat souhaité;
iii. il doit y avoir divulgation suffisante (paragraphe 70).
[242]
Lundbeck dispose d'un fondement valable pour prédire que le (+)-citalopram serait utile dans le traitement de la dépression chez l'humain. Le racémique s'était déjà révélé utile, et les mêmes essais
in vivo
et
in vitro
auxquels le citalopram avait été soumis ont été menés sur le (+)-citalopram et ont révélé que le (+)-citalopram présentait une meilleure activité que le citalopram lui-même.
[243]
Cependant, Apotex soutient que Lundbeck promet dans la divulgation que le (+)-citalopram est plus efficace sur le plan thérapeutique que le citalopram. Comme cette promesse ne pouvait être démontrée que par des essais chez l'humain, le brevet est invalide si cette promesse ne repose pas sur un fondement valable. J'admets que si elle a été faite, une telle promesse ne s'appuie pas sur une prédiction valable. Cependant, la véritable question est de savoir si Lundbeck l'a bel et bien formulée. J'estime que ce n'est pas le cas.
[244]
Apotex déduit cette promesse d'une déclaration de la divulgation selon laquelle [traduction] « la quasi-totalité de l'activité d'inhibition du captage de la 5-HT était attribuable à l'énantiomère (+)-citalopram », et d'un tableau présentant les résultats d'essais pharmacologiques
in vivo
et
in vitro
réalisés sur des rats et des souris. Voici le tableau en question:
[diagramme omis]
Plus le nombre est faible, meilleur est le résultat. Selon le tableau, le (+)-citalopram présente une activité de loin supérieure à celle des autres composés, étant environ 60 fois plus actif que le (-)-citalopram et environ 1,6 fois plus actif que le citalopram même.
[245]
Cependant, les experts, y compris M. Blier à la fin de son contre-interrogatoire, étaient d'accord pour dire que les essais menés sur les rongeurs ne constituent pas un fondement factuel approprié pour prédire que l'efficacité thérapeutique du (+)-citalopram serait supérieure à celle du citalopram. Les différences entre les espèces sont trop importantes.
[246]
J'accepte l'opinion de M. Jenner selon laquelle, en avril 1988, un pharmacologue se serait attendu à ce que les deux énantiomères du citalopram aient une certaine efficacité comme antidépresseurs chez les humains et à ce que l'un des énantiomères soit plus puissant que l'autre. Cependant, il n'a pas expliqué en quoi, d'après lui, le brevet promettait que le (+)-citalopram serait plus efficace chez l'humain que le racémate. M. Levy, un témoin des plus éminents appelé par Apotex, estimait que le brevet 452 s'adressait aux pharmacologues, aux chimistes et aux médecins intéressés par le traitement de la dépression. À son avis, cette personne versée dans l'art aurait compris que le brevet 452 promettait que le (+)-citalopram serait un antidépresseur plus puissant chez l'humain que le citalopram racémique. Cette puissance supérieure n'a pourtant pas été démontrée et aucun fondement factuel ni raisonnement divulgués n'autorisait les inventeurs à faire cette prédiction.
[247]
J'accepte ces éléments de preuve sans hésitation, y compris les notions fondamentales qu'il a présentées sur la pharmacologie et le métabolisme, sur la biodisponibilité et sur les différences relatives au métabolisme qui existent entre les espèces, et je considère qu'il n'y avait aucun fondement approprié pour prédire que le (+)-citalopram serait plus efficace que le citalopram dans le traitement de la dépression chez l'humain, nonobstant le fait que cela se soit avéré par la suite.
[248]
Il a souligné que, selon le brevet, la quasi-totalité de l'activité inhibitrice du recaptage de la 5-HT était associée au (+)-citalopram. Il a également ajouté que: [traduction] « un pharmacologue comprendrait de cet énoncé que la quasi-totalité de l'activité inhibitrice du recaptage de la 5-HT associée au citalopram chez l'humain serait due au (+)-citalopram » et, par déduction, que le (-)-citalopram présenterait une activité inhibitrice relativement faible pour ce qui concerne le recaptage de la 5-HT chez l'humain. Je souscris à ce raisonnement.
[249]
Il a toutefois ajouté: [traduction] « Le pharmacologue aurait compris que le brevet 452 promettait que le (+)-citalopram serait un antidépresseur plus puissant que le citalopram chez l'humain. »
[250]
Le Dr Blier, appelé par Lundbeck, a estimé que le brevet 452 promettait que le (+)-citalopram serait efficace dans le traitement de la dépression, sans garantir de résultat comparatif précis.
[251]
Apotex soutient que la preuve présentée par MM. Jenner et Levy doit l'emporter. Le Dr Blier a précisé qu'il avait travaillé pour Lundbeck, mais n'a pas révélé qu'il avait aussi travaillé chez Forest Laboratories, l'entreprise qui a commercialisé le (+)-citalopram aux États-Unis. Il avait également un parti pris contre les médicaments génériques. Je ne suis pas d'accord sur ce dernier point. Il ne souscrit pas à certaines des normes de Santé Canada en matière de bioéquivalence. Il n'est pas hostile aux génériques en tant que tels.
[252]
Encore une fois, comme le déclarait le juge Binnie dans l'arrêt
Whirlpool
, précité, au paragraphe 61: « l'interprétation des revendications est une question de droit qu'il appartient au juge de trancher, et celui-ci avait parfaitement le droit de donner aux revendications une interprétation différente de celle préconisée par les parties. »
[253]
Bien que la Cour ait besoin de l'avis des experts pour saisir les notions chimiques du brevet, les connaissances générales courantes et les attributs de la personne versée dans l'art, les points en litige n'ont rien de scientifique. MM. Jenner et Levy n'expliquent pas pourquoi la personne versée dans l'art visée par le brevet aurait inféré que le (+)-citalopram promettait d'être supérieur. La divulgation ou les revendications ne contiennent aucune déclaration explicite en ce sens. La partie du mémoire descriptif contenant les revendications prévaut sur la partie consacrée à la divulgation, c'est-à-dire qu'on se servira de la divulgation pour comprendre le sens d'un mot employé dans les revendications « mais non pour élargir ou restreindre la portée de la revendication telle qu'elle [est] écrite et, ainsi, interprétée » (
Whirlpool
, au paragraphe 52). Il est fatal de revendiquer plus que nécessaire. Le tableau montrait que c'est l'énantiomère (+) qui avait l'essentiel du pouvoir inhibiteur. La mention du citalopram comme point de référence ne peut passer pour une promesse. Aucune prédiction concernant la supériorité du (+)-citalopram sur le citalopram n'a été formulée.
[254]
Pour résumer, le brevet 452 est valide. Le concept inventif résidait dans les deux énantiomères du citalopram et dans les méthodes servant à les obtenir. Comme l'a déclaré l'avocat de Lundbeck, le premier à inventer un chemin qui mène au trésor peut aussi prétendre au trésor. Avant les travaux de Lundbeck, les énantiomères n'avaient pas été séparés du racémate. L'état des connaissances n'indiquait pas comment y parvenir. Leurs caractéristiques n'étaient pas connues. Les mesures prises par Lundbeck n'étaient pas évidentes pour la personne versée dans l'art et supposaient aussi un certain degré d'inventivité.
VII.
CONTREFAÇON
[255]
Ayant conclu que le brevet et que chacune de ses revendications étaient valides, j'aborderai à présent la question de la contrefaçon par Apotex et Apotex Pharmachem. L'une et l'autre ont admis que si le brevet était reconnu valide à tous égards, elles l'avaient contrefait.
[256]
En ce qui concerne les mesures de réparation, Lundbeck réclame non pas des dommages-intérêts compensatoires mais une restitution des profits. Elle demande également des dommages-intérêts punitifs, compte tenu de la conduite d'Apotex, et, comme il arrive souvent dans les actions en contrefaçon, la remise ou la destruction des quantités de médicament contrefait restantes, une injonction permanente jusqu'à la date d'expiration du brevet 452, les intérêts et les dépens. Je traiterai d'abord des dommages-intérêts punitifs.
A. Dommages-intérêts punitifs
[257]
Le fait qu'une partie demande la restitution des profits plutôt que des dommages-intérêts compensatoires n'empêche pas la Cour d'accorder des dommages-intérêts punitifs (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2012] ACS no 8 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2010] ACS no 51 (QL)). Des dommages-intérêts punitifs ou exemplaires peuvent être adjugés dans le cadre d'une action en contrefaçon de brevet (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 87, [2012] ACF no 107 (QL), actuellement en appel).
[258]
La Cour doit se demander si la conduite d'une partie est malveillante, opprimante et choque le sens de la dignité de la Cour ou si elle représente un écart marqué par rapport aux normes ordinaires en matière de comportement acceptable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2002] ACS no 19 (QL);
Microsoft Corporation c 9038-3746 Québec Inc
, 2006 CF 1509, 57 CPR (4th) 204, [2006] ACF no 1965 (QL)).
[259]
La preuve établit qu'Apotex s'est constitué des stocks de (+)-citalopram en prévoyant que le ministre ne se verrait pas interdire de délivrer un avis de conformité. Elle s'est trompée dans sa prédiction, tant en première instance qu'en appel.
[260]
Comme il lui était défendu de commercialiser le (+)-citalopram au Canada, elle a ensuite vendu une certaine quantité de ce médicament à des sociétés affiliées en République tchèque et en Australie.
[261]
M. Bernard Sherman, président-directeur général d'Apotex, a déclaré qu'il arrivait que celle-ci prenne la décision commerciale de se constituer des stocks en comptant sur une issue favorable de l'instance relative à l'avis de conformité, de manière à pouvoir entrer sur le marché aussitôt que possible. Quelquefois, cette stratégie fonctionne; dans d'autres cas, comme en l'espèce, elle se retourne contre elle.
[262]
Je ne pense pas que la conduite d'Apotex justifie l'octroi de dommages-intérêts punitifs.
[263]
M. Sherman a déclaré qu'il était immédiatement intervenu pour mettre fin aux ventes des stocks à l'étranger dès qu'il en a eu vent. Apotex n'a présenté aucun élément de preuve quant aux mesures de protection mises en place, le cas échéant, pour empêcher de telles ventes. Quoi qu'il en soit, la contrefaçon a débuté avec le stockage et non avec les ventes à l'étranger.
[264]
N'eût été le Règlement MB (AC) et son équivalent, le Food and Drug Regulations, il est vraisemblable que Santé Canada aurait jugé la version générique d'Apotex sûre et efficace et qu'Apotex aurait pu entrer sur le marché canadien. La question aurait alors été de savoir si Lundbeck aurait pu obtenir une injonction interlocutoire: c'est improbable puisque l'octroi de dommages-intérêts aurait constitué une réparation convenable.
[265]
La conduite d'Apotex ne se compare pas à celle que décrit le juge Martineau dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, dans laquelle il conclut que Bell Helicopter avait revendiqué l'invention d'Eurocopter comme la sienne.
[266]
Lundbeck reproche également à Apotex son attitude cavalière dans les actes de procédure précédents en ce qu'elle y niait expressément toute contrefaçon si le brevet devait être jugé valide. Il s'agit peut-être d'une question d'interprétation des actes de procédure, qui sont assez ambigus, ou d'échec de communication entre les avocats et leurs clients. Quoi qu'il en soit, il est plus indiqué de traiter ce point sous la rubrique des dépens, dont les parties ont reconnu qu'ils devaient être mis en délibéré.
B. Restitution des profits
[267]
Comme pour toutes les réparations en
equity
, le juge du procès a le pouvoir discrétionnaire de décider d'accorder ou non cette réparation. Apotex soutient qu'il faut la refuser en l'espèce: Lundbeck n'a pas droit aux profits qu'Apotex a tirés de la vente du (+)-citalopram à l'étranger et obtiendrait un avantage inéquitable en percevant les recettes venant des marchés australien et tchèque, Lundbeck n'ayant d'ailleurs produit aucun élément de preuve qui établisse qu'elle est entrée en concurrence sur ces marchés.
[268]
Par ailleurs, d'après M. Sherman, Apotex a agi de bonne foi en considérant que le brevet 452 était invalide, et puis, il ignorait d'abord que le (+)-citalopram avait été expédié aux sociétés affiliées d'Apotex pour être vendu en Australie et en République tchèque. Lorsqu'il l'a appris, il est intervenu pour y mettre fin.
[269]
Lundbeck rétorque que la réparation en
equity
demandée est visée par l'alinéa 57(1)
b
) de la
Loi sur les brevets
, et que même si la Cour n'est pas liée par le choix d'une partie, cette réparation est couramment accordée.
[270]
La réparation demandée est généralement acceptée à moins que certaines circonstances ne justifient de la refuser à la partie qui a gain de cause (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), conf. par (1996), 70 CPR (3d) 183 (CAF), [1996] ACF no 1385 (QL)). À mon avis, il n'y a aucune raison de priver Lundbeck de la réparation qu'elle a choisie. Comme le soulignait le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL):
Il est très important de se rappeler que les principes régissant l'attribution de dommages-intérêts au propriétaire d'un brevet, recours habituellement choisi et qui est, bien sûr, strictement juridique, doivent nécessairement différer complètement de ceux qui sont en jeu lorsqu'on applique le pur recours de l'equity voulant que le contrefacteur rende compte de tous les bénéfices découlant de son acte illicite. Dans ce dernier cas, la situation du demandeur qui a eu gain de cause, pour autant qu'il s'agit de savoir si, oui ou non, il a subi un tort ou un dommage, est complètement sans pertinence et, par conséquent, ne doit pas être prise en considération.
[271]
Par conséquent, le fait que Lundbeck n'ait présenté aucun élément de preuve ayant trait à sa position sur les marchés australien et tchèque est dépourvu de pertinence. Il se peut très bien qu'elle n'y ait subi que des pertes négligeables, sinon nulles. Il n'en demeure pas moins qu'Apotex a réalisé un profit et qu'elle doit en rendre compte.
[272]
Par ailleurs, la bonne foi des défenderesses reconventionnelles n'est pas plus pertinente. Elles ne sont pas punies, mais elles ont usurpé les droits de Lundbeck en matière de propriété intellectuelle et doivent rendre les profits qu'elles ont réalisés. Il serait absolument déraisonnable d'accepter qu'une contrefaçon qui dure depuis plusieurs années se solde par une déclaration portant que le brevet est valide et qu'on les laisse continuer ce qu'elles n'auraient jamais dû commencer à faire.
C. Les profits
[273]
Le principe est clair. Apotex et Apotex Pharmachem doivent rendre compte des revenus générés par la vente du (+)-citalopram. Elles ont le droit de déduire les dépenses raisonnablement engagées à cette fin. Le reste va à Lundbeck. Comme il arrive souvent, ce sont les détails qui posent problème.
[274]
Entre 2005 et 2010, Apotex a acheté de l'oxalate de (+)-citalopram à deux sources en
[caviardé
], puis une petite quantité à Apotex Pharmachem.
[275]
Apotex Inc. a acheté un total de
[caviardé]
d'oxalate de (+)-citalopram aux deux sociétés
[caviardé
], à l'exception des sociétés
[caviardé
]. Rien n'indique que ces sociétés soient liées à Apotex.
[Caviardé
] ont été retournés à l'un des vendeurs
[caviardé
]. Les parties reconnaissent que les quantités suivantes de (+)-citalopram ou d'oxalate de (+)-citalopram sont visées par l'exception liée à l'usage expérimental prévue à l'article 55.2 de la Loi:
i. 48,919 kg de médicament en réserve destiné à la recherche et au développement;
ii. 0,53 kg de médicament en réserve et d'échantillons en bon état conservés;
iii. 2,59 kg d'échantillons en bon état en cours de fabrication et finis.
[276]
Apotex reconnaît avoir réalisé des profits de 969 072,94 $ sur des ventes de
[caviardé
].
[277]
Apotex Pharmachem Inc. reconnaît avoir touché un profit de 33 568 $ sur une vente de
[caviardé
].
[278]
Lundbeck soutient qu'Apotex aurait dû vendre le (+)-citalopram à sa société affiliée australienne à un prix bien supérieur. Elle conteste également certaines des dépenses déclarées par Apotex et Apotex Pharmachem.
[279]
La Cour a entendu la preuve d'expert de deux comptables agréés, Pierre St-Laurent et Howard Rosen, appelés respectivement par Lundbeck et Apotex. Ce sont tous deux des experts comptables judiciaires expérimentés et habilités à assister la Cour. Cette remarque appelle deux mises en garde. La première est qu'ils ont cherché l'un et l'autre à expliquer, du point de vue comptable, certaines décisions, alors que c'est à la Cour qu'il appartient d'expliquer la signification de ces décisions.
[280]
La deuxième, comme l'a fait remarquer Lundbeck, est que le cabinet de M. Rosen a agi pendant de nombreuses années comme comptable externe d'Apotex et que celle-ci l'a appelé personnellement comme témoin expert à de nombreuses reprises. Cet argument n'est pas vraiment étonnant si l'on pense au cas de M. Davies, même s'il est peut-être plus bénin dans ce contexte. Cela dit, la position de Lundbeck n'est pas forcément injustifiée puisque M. Rosen a admis que certaines dépenses avaient réellement été engagées, bien qu'aucune facture n'ait été produite.
[281]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2004] ACS no 29 (QL), la juge en chef McLachlin et le juge Fish, s'exprimant au nom de la majorité, indiquent aux paragraphes 100 et suivants que le calcul des profits à restituer repose sur la méthode du « profit différentiel »; ils renvoient à un article du professeur Norman Siebrasse intitulé « A Remedial Benefit-Based Approach to the Innocent-User Problem in the Patenting of Higher Life Forms » (2004), 20 C.I.P.R. 79. Le professeur Siebrasse y présente la jurisprudence canadienne comme assez incohérente, et estime que la Cour suprême des États-Unis a bien expliqué l'approche du « profit différentiel » dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1871), à la page 651:
[traduction] La question à trancher en l'espèce est de savoir quel avantage le défendeur a tiré de l'utilisation de l'invention de la plaignante par rapport aux autres procédés alors disponibles qui lui auraient permis d'obtenir un résultat tout aussi bénéfique.
[282]
Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour a estimé que la demanderesse ne pouvait pas solliciter des dommages-intérêts si elle avait déjà demandé une remise des profits. M. Schmeiser n'avait tiré aucun bénéfice de son usage du brevet relatif au canola, car il pouvait parvenir au même résultat sans s'en servir.
[283]
Le cas d'espèce est bien différent. Le seul ingrédient actif dans le médicament d'Apotex est le (+)-citalopram. Par conséquent, Apotex doit remettre tous les profits réalisés moins les dépenses légitimes.
[284]
Je commencerai par examiner les revenus, avant de traiter des dépenses.
[285]
Le principal témoin factuel concernant les ventes d'Apotex en République tchèque et en Australie était Gordon Fahner, son vice-président, Opérations commerciales et financières. Il a expliqué que le système comptable de la société reposait sur un logiciel de planification des ressources de l'entreprise (PRE). Une fois les dépenses effectivement engagées, les variations entre le budget et la réalité sont enregistrées. Le système, en place depuis 2001, est remarquablement précis.
[286]
Les prix de transfert à des filiales étrangères dépendent jusqu'à un certain point du régime réglementaire en place. En République tchèque, le prix de gros des marchandises doit être identique au coût d'importation. Cela ne laisse aucune place aux dépenses engagées par la filiale tchèque. Cette dernière a été compensée au Canada par une société Apotex. Cependant, aucune déduction n'a été demandée et aucun crédit ne peut donc être accordé. Lundbeck accepte que le total des ventes en République tchèque s'élevait à
[caviardé
] et ne conteste pas le caractère raisonnable de ce montant.
[287]
Le marché australien était très différent. Le prix de vente était plus bas. Apotex est toujours restée sur ses gardes quant à l'éventuelle position des autorités fiscales canadiennes en matière de prix de transfert entre sociétés ayant entre elles un lien de dépendance. Voir par exemple l'arrêt récent de la Cour suprême
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACS no 52 (QL). Une marge de profit de
[caviardé
] sur le prix de vente C.I.F. a été jugée acceptable. Cependant, pour des raisons qu'elle n'a pas vraiment expliquées, le profit de
[caviardé
] d'Apotex dépassait à peine
[caviardé
].
[288]
L'avocat de Lundbeck laisse toutefois entendre que le prix de vente aurait dû être supérieur à 10 000 000 $, voire s'élever à près de 13 000 000 $. Ces hypothèses reposent sur la théorie que Apotex pouvait vendre le médicament en Australie au même prix qu'en République tchèque et qu'en fait, elle [traduction] « laissait en attente » ses profits à l'étranger. M. Sherman a déclaré qu'aucune somme d'argent n'était revenue au Canada de manière indirecte par voie de dividendes ou autrement. Si Apotex avait réorganisé ses affaires de manière à éviter une comptabilité exacte, Lundbeck aurait pu avoir raison. Toutefois, ces relations commerciales existent depuis un certain temps et ne visaient pas à lui nuire. Les faits en présence sont plutôt à rapprocher avec ceux de l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), qui concernait un navire vendu puis remis à la disposition du propriétaire initial par le biais d'un affrètement coque nue, dans le cadre d'un refinancement. Cette opération avait eu pour effet de mettre en échec une partie de l'action
in rem
du demandeur. La Cour a néanmoins estimé qu'en l'absence de mauvaise foi, le demandeur, un réparateur de navires, avait perdu ce recours.
[289]
Apotex Pharmachem n'a effectué qu'une seule vente, à Apotex elle-même. Cette vente s'élevait à
[caviardé
] canadiens, ce qui correspond à
[caviardé
] canadiens par kilo. Le prix de vente n'a pas été contesté, contrairement aux dépenses déclarées.
[290]
Les experts ont abordé les dépenses légitimes d'une manière bien différente. Pour commencer avec Apotex, voici les coûts de vente qu'elle déclare:
Ventes
Coût des ventes
Matériel
Matériel d'emballage
Écarts sur matériel
Coûts de main-d'œuvre directe
Coûts de main-d'œuvre - préparation/nettoyage
Coûts indirects spécifiques
Coûts directs du contrôle de la qualité
Coûts indirects généraux
Coûts indirects du contrôle de la qualité
Coûts indirects fixes
[CAVIARDÉ]
Dépréciation
Loyer
Sous-total
Arrondissement des différences
Total
Profit
Quantités vendues (kg)
[291]
M. St-Laurent accepte le coût du matériel, mais ne concèderait que
[caviardé
] à l'égard des coûts australiens d'emballage, étant donné que les factures justificatives n'ont pas été produites. Il ne reconnaît aucune des déductions liées aux ventes réalisées dans l'un ou l'autre des pays pour ce qui est des coûts de main-d'œuvre directe, des coûts de main-d'œuvre -préparation/nettoyage, des coûts indirects spécifiques, des coûts directs liés au contrôle de la qualité, des coûts indirects généraux, des coûts indirects liés au contrôle de la qualité, des coûts indirects fixes, de la dépréciation et du loyer.
[292]
M. Rosen concèderait toutes les dépenses réclamées par Apotex.
[293]
M. St-Laurent estime que ces coûts, fixes et variables, directs ou indirects, auraient été déboursés de toute façon. Les employés n'étaient pas rémunérés à la pièce, et auraient été payés, que le (+)-citalopram fût fabriqué ou non. Il se réfère dans son rapport à son témoignage d'expert livré devant la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL). Un des problèmes, en l'occurrence, venait de ce que les chiffres de vente se rapportaient à toute une machine, dont seule une partie était contrefaite. Cela avait soulevé des questions de ventilation. Sur la question de la remise des profits, le juge Rouleau avait déclaré au paragraphe 70: « L'octroi de cette réparation vise à restituer les bénéfices réalisés à leur propriétaire légitime, soit le demandeur, de façon à éliminer tout enrichissement injuste du défendeur. »
[294]
Quoique M. St-Laurent prétende que ses opinions quant aux aspects comptables ont été acceptées dans l'ensemble, le juge Rouleau s'est dit incapable de conclure que les profits réalisés par le contrefacteur découlaient de la violation du brevet de Beloit. Il a donc déclaré au paragraphe 79: « C'est la raison pour laquelle je n'ai pas mentionné en détail la preuve des experts en comptabilité que les deux parties ont appelés. J'ai bien tenu compte de leur témoignage, mais il se rapporte fort peu à la question à trancher. ». L'appel a été accueilli en partie, 94 FTR 102, 61 CPR (3d) 271, [1995] ACF no 733 (QL), mais ne s'est pas étendu sur la manière dont le juge Rouleau a apprécié la preuve concernant les profits réalisés grâce aux parties non contrefaites de la machine.
[295]
Je ne vois dans cette décision aucun enseignement sous-jacent susceptible de nous être utile.
[296]
M. Rosen invoque également son expérience en salle d'audience. En tant que comptable, sa méthode de prédilection est celle du coût complet, par laquelle tous les coûts d'une entreprise sont répartis proportionnellement par rapport à ceux des produits fabriqués. Cependant, le juge MacKay n'a pas entièrement souscrit à cette démarche dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL). Voilà une autre affaire dans laquelle les ventes du contrefacteur se rapportaient à des éléments contrefaits et non contrefaits. Il a évoqué en termes favorables la méthode comptable du coût différentiel, ou progressive, envisagée par la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), par laquelle les revenus sont calculés en déduisant les coûts fixes et variables qui ont contribué à gagner les sommes reçues. Aucune des dépenses qui auraient été engagées si la contrefaçon n'avait pas eu lieu ne doit être considérée comme déductible. Après avoir évoqué l'insuffisance de la preuve et s'être limité aux circonstances de l'affaire, il a autorisé les dépenses suivantes: a) le coût du matériel; b) la ventilation des coûts annuels d'Apotex liés à la main-d'œuvre et des coûts indirects de production en fonction de la proportion d'unités du produit contrefait par rapport à la production totale de tous les produits; c) une ventilation similaire du coût annuel de vente; d) autres coûts sujets à consentement. Cette affaire non plus ne doit pas être suivie au pied de la lettre.
[297]
S'agissant des coûts individuels contestés, je n'autoriserai, comme M. St-Laurent, que
[caviardé
] des
[caviardé
] relativement au coût du matériel d'emballage pour les exportations australiennes. Le fardeau de la preuve incombait à Apotex, qui n'a pas produit le moindre élément pour justifier ces coûts. M. Rosen a accepté ce montant, car les écarts après les dépenses engagées étaient autrement très mineurs, comme nous l'avons vu. Il était logique de présumer que les dépenses avaient été engagées. Cela est fort possible, mais il n'est pas établi qu'il s'agit là d'un principe comptable. C'est à la Cour de décider si cette conclusion procède de la déduction ou de l'hypothèse. À mon avis, en l'absence de documents justificatifs, le coût du matériel d'emballage est de l'ordre de la conjecture. Comme le déclarait lord  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 45:
[traduction] Il est souvent très difficile de faire la distinction entre une hypothèse et une déduction. Une hypothèse peut être plausible, mais elle n'a aucune valeur en droit puisqu'il s'agit d'une simple supposition. Par contre, une déduction au sens juridique est une déduction tirée de la preuve et si elle est justifiée, elle pourra avoir une valeur probante.

Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL).
[298]
Je concéderai sans difficulté les coûts de main-d'œuvre directe, de main-d'œuvre - préparation/nettoyage, les coûts indirects spécifiques et les coûts directs de contrôle de la qualité. Ces chiffres n'ont pas été contestés. Ce qui fait l'objet d'un litige était la question de savoir s'ils devraient être déduits de la somme des profits à restituer.
[299]
Abstraction faite de la décision du juge MacKay, il est bien établi qu'en l'absence de preuve précise, le demandeur qui utilise sa propre main-d'œuvre pour réparer les dommages causés par un défendeur ne peut réaliser de profits, mais qu'il a cependant le droit de facturer le coût de la main-d'œuvre, y compris les coûts indirects spécifiques, au motif que ses employés auraient autrement été affectés à une autre tâche productive. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 196, [2011] ACF no 602 (QL) au paragraphe 56, et la jurisprudence qui y est citée. L'appel, qui a confirmé la décision, 2012 ACF 199, 433 NR 152, [2012] FCJ no 855 (QL), n'a pas traité cette question. La Cour suprême a accordé l'autorisation d'interjeter appel.)

Cependant, je ne suis pas disposé à autoriser les coûts indirects généraux, les coûts indirects liés au contrôle de la qualité, les coûts indirects fixes, ainsi que les coûts liés à la dépréciation et au loyer. Cela ressemble fort à mon sens à une méthode de coûts complets. Dans la décision du juge MacKay, il n'y a pas eu de ventilation des coûts indirects généraux et spécifiques comme en l'espèce. Je m'inspire de la décision du juge en chef adjoint  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL). Cette affaire concernait la rupture d'un contrat d'affrètement. Les dommages-intérêts demandés correspondaient aux profits qui auraient été réalisés si le contrat avait été exécuté. Les dommages-intérêts devaient être déterminés en calculant le fret qui aurait été gagné moins les dépenses que le transporteur aurait ce faisant engagées, compte tenu par ailleurs de l'atténuation des dommages subis. Les calculs de la demanderesse ressemblaient à ce que les comptables qualifient de méthode de coûts directs en ce qu'ils incluaient le salaire de l'équipage, l'assurance, l'entretien, les lubrifiants et la dépréciation. La défenderesse n'incluait dans ses déductions que des données afférentes aux gains relatifs à un transport particulier, comme les frais de chargement et de déchargement, de soute et les redevances portuaires, en partant du principe que les autres dépenses auraient été engagées par le propriétaire du navire, peu importe le trajet. Le juge en chef adjoint Thurlow penchait davantage du côté de la défenderesse, mais n'était tout à fait d'accord ni avec l'une ni avec l'autre partie.
[301]
Il me semble que les coûts indirects généraux, les coûts indirects liés au contrôle de la qualité, les coûts indirects fixes, les coûts liés à la dépréciation et au loyer sont trop éloignés pour être attribuables à la fabrication du (+)-citalopram, et c'est pourquoi je les rejette.
[302]
Par conséquent, je fixe le profit d'Apotex à 1 410 906,21 $, sur la base de ventes de
[caviardé
], moins
[caviardé
] de dépenses (
[caviardé
] pour le matériel,
[caviardé
] pour l'emballage,
[caviardé
] pour les coûts de main-d'œuvre directe,
[caviardé
] pour les coûts de main-d'œuvre - préparation/nettoyage,
[caviardé
] pour les coûts indirects spécifiques et
[caviardé
] pour les coûts directs de contrôle de la qualité).
[303]
Pour ce qui est d'Apotex Pharmachem, M. St-Laurent estime que les dépenses déclarées sont bien trop élevées. Cependant, c'était la première fois que cette société fabriquait le (+)-citalopram. Le coût du premier produit à sortir de la chaîne de montage est toujours plus élevé que si le coût de lancement avait été réparti sur une production beaucoup plus importante. Sur les
[caviardé
] de dépenses déclarées, il ne concèderait que
[caviardé
]. Sur la foi des mêmes principes que j'ai appliqués à Apotex, je ne rejetterais que les
[caviardé
] de coûts indirects fixes d'Apotex Pharmachem, tels qu'ils ont été calculés par M. Rosen.
[304]
Par conséquent, Apotex Pharmachem doit restituer des profits de 304 177,38 $, sur la base du montant de sa seule vente, soit
[caviardé],
moins les dépenses
[caviardé
].
D. Remise ou destruction
[305]
L'article 57 de la
Loi sur les brevets
, dans sa version antérieure et actuelle, prévoit que la Cour peut rendre l'ordonnance qu'elle juge à propos de rendre à l'égard des agissements d'une partie et, d'une façon générale, quant aux procédures de l'action. Il est admis que la Cour peut ordonner la remise ou la destruction du produit contrefait à titre de réparation. En l'espèce, Apotex a encore en sa possession 8,34 kilos de (+)-citalopram. Elle a fait valoir qu'elle devrait être en mesure de négocier un protocole acceptable avec Lundbeck, au cas où il serait établi qu'elle avait contrefait le médicament. Cette proposition est raisonnable, et je laisse donc les parties en établir les conditions.
E. Injonction permanente
[306]
Lundbeck est en droit d'obtenir une ordonnance interdisant aux défenderesses, directement ou indirectement, ainsi qu'à leurs agents et administrateurs, préposés, employés ou agents de l'une d'elles, ou à toute personne, société ou entité agissant sur leurs instructions ou sous leur contrôle, de fabriquer, vendre, distribuer, annoncer, exposer pour la vente, offrir à la vente, stocker ou posséder, aux fins susmentionnées ou pour importer au Canada le (+)-citalopram avant l'expiration du brevet 1 339 452 le 9 septembre 2014.
F. Intérêts
[307]
L'octroi des intérêts avant et après jugement est régi par les articles 36 et 27 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
. Une distinction s'impose entre les causes d'action surgissant à l'intérieur d'une province, et celles qui se présentent à l'extérieur d'une province ou dans plus d'une province. Lundbeck soutient que la cause d'action a surgi en Ontario, ce que reconnaît Apotex. Loin de moi l'idée contraire, d'autant que la Cour aurait eu le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'ordonner un taux d'intérêt plus élevé si la cause d'action avait surgi dans plus d'une province.
[308]
Dans les circonstances, la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
intègre le droit ontarien, et en particulier les articles 127 et suivants de la
Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires
, LRO 1990, c C43. Les intérêts avant jugement doivent être calculés à partir de la date à laquelle la cause d'action a surgi, au taux minimal de la Banque du Canada sur les avances à court terme consenties aux banques énumérées à l'annexe I de la
Loi sur les banques
. Les intérêts après jugement correspondent à ce taux plus un pour cent.
[309]
Bien que la cause d'action découle d'un stockage contraire à la
Loi sur les brevets
, les réparations se seraient limitées à une injonction, à une ordonnance de remise ou de destruction et aux dépens s'il n'y avait pas eu de vente. Aucun intérêt n'aurait été accordé. Les intérêts adjugés reposent sur les ventes. D'après les dossiers d'Apotex, les ventes ont débuté le 8 juin 2009 et ont pris fin le 20 août 2010. La seule vente ayant dépassé 200 000 $, celle du 23 décembre 2009, représente une valeur médiane approximative. Calculer les intérêts sur chaque vente serait intolérable. Je fixe le point de départ de calcul des intérêts avant jugement sur les ventes d'Apotex au 1er janvier 2010.
[310]
Apotex Pharmachem n'a effectué qu'une seule vente, à Apotex elle-même. Cette vente a été réalisée le 22 juin 2010, date à partir de laquelle les intérêts avant jugement commenceront à courir.
[311]
Nonobstant le fait qu'il reste à rendre un jugement formel, les intérêts après jugement commencent à courir à partir de la date des présents motifs.
IX. DÉPENS
[312]
À la demande des parties, une ordonnance ou des directives concernant les dépens sont mises en délibéré.
X.
CONFIDENTIALITÉ
[313]
Comme une grande partie de la preuve et des témoignages étaient visés par diverses ordonnances de confidentialité et de mise sous scellé, les parties disposeront de dix (10) jours à partir de la date des présents motifs pour indiquer à la Cour, en étant d'accord espérons-le, les passages qui devraient être supprimés ou modifiés dans la version publique, et pour fournir des suggestions en ce sens.
[314]
Par souci du bon ordre, toutes les objections soulevées durant le procès et n'ayant pas été tranchées sont rejetées.
XI.
RÉDACTION DU JUGEMENT
[315]
Conformément à l'article 394 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
, j'ordonne à l'avocat de Lundbeck de rédiger un projet de jugement donnant effet aux présents motifs, dont la forme et le contenu devront être approuvés par Apotex. Si les parties ne parviennent pas à s'entendre, elles doivent en informer la Cour dans un délai de dix (10) jours à compter de la date des présents motifs, et Lundbeck devra présenter une requête écrite en jugement, conformément à l'article 369 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
.
