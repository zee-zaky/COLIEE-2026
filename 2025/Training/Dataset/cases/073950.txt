Introduction
[1]
Fothergill, J.
: Sharof Shukurov has brought an application for judicial review pursuant to s 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA]. Mr. Shukurov challenges the dismissal by the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [the RAD] of his appeal of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division [the RPD]. The RPD determined that Mr. Shukurov was neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of s 96 of the IRPA nor a person in need of protection as defined in s 97(1) of the IRPA.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the RAD applied the wrong standard of review to the RPD's decision and the wrong test to determine the admissibility of additional evidence submitted on appeal. I am unable to say whether the result would have been the same if the appropriate standard and test had been applied, and accordingly the application for judicial review is allowed.
II.
Background
[3]
Mr. Shukurov is a citizen of Uzbekistan. His claim for refugee protection was based on the following contentions:
• Mr. Shukurov was employed as a hotel manager in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. In January, 2013, a police officer called to reserve the hotel's pool and sauna in order to entertain his guests. Mr. Shukurov complied and made a note of the reservation.
• The owner of the hotel saw the reservation and recognized the name of the police officer. Based on previous experience, the owner was concerned that the police officer would not pay for the use of the pool and sauna. The owner therefore arranged for signs to be placed indicating that both were out of service.
• When the police officer arrived with his guests and discovered that he would not be able to use the sauna or the pool, he became angry with Mr. Shukurov. Mr. Shukurov, who was unaware of the hotel owner's actions, could offer no explanation.
• Two days after the incident, the police officer demanded the equivalent of $5,000 from Mr. Shukurov as "compensation" for the embarrassment he had suffered in front of his guests. When Mr. Shukurov objected, the police officer threatened to bring false criminal charges against him.
• Mr. Shukurov complied with the police officer's demands with an initial payment of $1,000. The police officer indicated that he expected the balance to be paid in instalments of $500 every month.
• Mr. Shukurov approached another police officer and a state prosecutor to explain his predicament and to lodge a complaint. He was told by these officials that a complaint would be futile and that the police officer would be protected by other public officials, as this kind of extortion was commonplace.
• Mr. Shukurov then decided to leave the country. He applied for a Canadian visa on February 24, 2013. Mr. Shukurov continued to make monthly payments to the police officer until he arrived in Canada on May 14, 2013.
[4]
Mr. Shukurov made a refugee claim on June 13, 2013. His claim was rejected by the RPD on November 21, 2013. Mr. Shukurov then appealed the decision to the RAD. The appeal was dismissed on July 28, 2014.
[5]
Mr. Shukurov brought an application for leave and for judicial review in this Court on August 11, 2014. Leave was granted on March 12, 2015.
III.
The RAD's Decision
[6]
Mr. Shukurov submitted a number of additional documents in support of his appeal in accordance with s 110(4) of the IRPA. The RAD relied on this Court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] to reject all but one of these documents due to its concerns about their provenance and authenticity. The appeal was therefore heard on the basis of the record of proceedings before the RPD, the submissions of the parties, the testimony of Mr. Shukurov, and one additional document.
[7]
Mr. Shukurov argued before the RAD that the RPD's decision was flawed in three respects: a) the RPD's finding that there was no nexus between the risk faced by Mr. Shukurov and the grounds for refugee status contained in the Convention; b) the RPD's negative credibility assessment based on a lack of corroborative evidence; and c) adverse inferences made by the RPD due to inconsistencies in Mr. Shukurov's oral evidence and its rejection of Mr. Shukurov's explanations for those inconsistencies.
[8]
The RAD referred to the decision of this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] in support of its conclusion that the standard of review to be applied to appeals that involve mixed questions of fact and law is reasonableness.
[9]
The RPD found there to be no nexus between the risk faced by Mr. Shukurov and the criteria for refugee protection because the police officer's threats and extortion did not amount to persecution within the meaning of the Convention. In reviewing this finding, the RAD noted that Mr. Shukurov had not expressed any views regarding police corruption that could be perceived as political opinion against the government. Furthermore, the evidence submitted by Mr. Shukurov to demonstrate that he was a "wanted person" in Uzbekistan was found by the RPD not to be credible. The RAD concluded that the RPD's determination was reasonable.
[10]
The RAD then considered the RPD's adverse finding regarding Mr. Shukurov's credibility. The RAD observed that the RPD had identified a number of questions regarding the provenance of the documents submitted by Mr. Shukurov, including how he came to receive them in Canada. The RAD concluded that it was reasonable for the RPD to insist on corroborative evidence, and to assign little or no probative value to the documents when this was not forthcoming. The RAD accepted that the absence of corroborative documentation would not, in itself, be a reason to reject Mr. Shukurov's credibility. However, combined with the inconsistencies in Mr. Shukurov's oral testimony, the RAD once again found the RPD's conclusion to be reasonable.
[11]
Finally, the RAD noted that Mr. Shukurov was given an opportunity by the RPD to dispel its concerns. However, Mr. Shukurov was unable to recall key facts because he had "forgotten" them. The RAD concluded that it was open to the RPD to find that Mr. Shukurov's account of events was not reasonable and to expect medical reports if Mr. Shukurov was suffering from memory loss.
[12]
The RAD confirmed the determination of the RPD that Mr. Shukurov was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA, and dismissed the appeal.
IV.
Issues
[13]
The following issues are raised by this application for judicial review:
A. Whether the RAD applied the wrong standard of review to the RPD's decision; and
B. Whether the RAD applied the wrong test to determine the admissibility of additional evidence submitted on appeal.
V.
Analysis
A.
Whether the RAD applied the wrong standard of review to the RPD's decision
[14]
The RAD is a relatively new appellate tribunal. The law regarding the standard of review to be applied by this Court to the RAD's determination of its own standard of review is not yet settled. This Court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] is currently before the Federal Court of Appeal. Until the matter is resolved by higher courts, I align myself with Justice Martineau in adopting a "pragmatic approach". As Justice Martineau observed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 37:
[37] [...] For the time being, there appear to be a number of possible approaches, but what is clear, however, is that the option chosen by the RAD (a judicial review-based approach) is not an acceptable outcome in law. Even applying the lesser standard of reasonableness, I still arrive at the same end result as my colleagues who applied the more stringent correctness standard. Intervention is warranted in this case. In this way, the choice of appropriate standard of review will not be determinative of the matter.
[15]
I have discussed this Court's jurisprudence regarding the legal issues raised in this application for judicial review in a number of recent decisions:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]
;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
.
Based upon the analysis found in these decisions, I am satisfied that the RAD commits an error when it reviews the RPD's findings against the standard of reasonableness and fails to conduct its own assessment of the evidence. Although not unanimous on this point (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), most judges of this Court have come to the same conclusion ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 41; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 47 and 54;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 53).
[16]
Some judges of this Court have held that the RAD does not commit a reviewable error when it applies the standard or reasonableness to findings of pure credibility ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). However, as explained by Justice Noël in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 32, this Court will uphold the RAD's application of the reasonableness standard to the RPD's findings of credibility only when it is clear that the RAD has in fact conducted its own assessment of the evidence. This is also the thrust of Justice Shore's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> where he notes that in cases involving findings of pure credibility, the point is not which standard was applied but rather "whether the RAD conducted an independent assessment of the evidence as a whole." I am therefore of the view that the RAD's obligation to conduct an independent assessment of the evidence extends to questions of credibility; although where no hearing is held before the RAD, deference may be owed to credibility findings of the RPD that are based on a witness' conduct before the panel ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 12).
[17]
In this case, the RAD said the following about the standard of review it should apply to decisions of the RPD:
[...] counsel submitted that "the RPD is required to (re-) consider the evidence filed at the RPD and form its own opinion to assess the decision". It would appear that counsel meant to say that the RAD is to consider the totality of the evidence. I concur if that is what the Appellant has submitted.
In this case, the issues are to be considered on the standard of reasonableness. The reasonableness standard is concerned with the "existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility in the decision-making process" and with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law as per <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[18]
This statement is ambiguous and appears to be internally inconsistent. I am not persuaded that the RAD properly understood its obligation to conduct a full, fact-based assessment of Mr. Shukurov's claim. The RAD reviewed the decision of the RPD against the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> standard of reasonableness and made a determination as to whether each of the RPD's conclusions fell within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 47). The RAD's misplaced reliance on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and its application of the reasonableness standard is confirmed by the following statement in its decision:
Counsel submitted that the jurisprudence requires the RAD to look at the totality of the evidence before it. I have done so and find that the RPD's finding and determination is reasonable and meets the [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] test as stated above. Based on the foregoing, I find that the RPD's decision is reasonable.
[19]
It is therefore clear that the RAD did not conduct an independent, fact-based assessment of the evidence. The RAD is an appellate body and it commits a reviewable error when it applies the standard of judicial review while fulfilling its appellate functions ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 7). While it is possible for the RAD to misstate the applicable standard of review but nevertheless conduct an independent review of the evidence, for the reasons expressed above I find that this did not happen here. The application for judicial review must be allowed.
B.
Whether the RAD applied the wrong test to determine the admissibility of additional evidence submitted on appeal
[20]
Questions regarding the admissibility of additional evidence before the RAD are reviewable against the standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Singh
]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 37).
[21]
Mr. Shukurov objects to the RAD's reliance on the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to determine whether additional evidence should be permitted on appeal. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> concerned the admission of new evidence in the context of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA). The RAD described <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> as "the leading case on new evidence," but it did not address why the criteria for admitting new evidence in the context of a PRRA should also apply to an appeal before the RAD.
[22]
Mr. Shukurov notes that in
Singh
and
Khachatourian,
this Court held that the criteria identified in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> should not automatically be applied to a determination of whether additional evidence may be adduced before the RAD. Mr. Shukurov argues that even if the RAD was entitled to apply the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria, then the RAD's application of these criteria was unreasonable because its analysis of the evidence's materiality and credibility was flawed.
[23]
The Minister points out that the language of the new evidence provisions in the PRRA context (s 113(a) of the IRPA) and in the RAD context (s 110(4) of the IRPA) are very similar, and it was therefore reasonable for the RAD to apply the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria to determine whether additional evidence should be admitted before the RAD. The Minister relies on the recent decision of Justice Mosley in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[24]
This issue is also the subject of differing jurisprudence from this Court. As I discussed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the similarity of the provisions does not necessarily mean that the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria apply to the admission of additional evidence in an appeal before the RAD. The purposes of an appeal before the RAD and a PRRA are distinct. This was recognized by the Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[12] A PRRA application by a failed refugee claimant
is not an appeal
or reconsideration of the decision of the RPD to reject a claim for refugee protection. Nevertheless, it may require consideration of some or all of the same factual and legal issues as a claim for refugee protection.
In such cases there is an obvious risk of wasteful and potentially abusive relitigation. The IRPA mitigates that risk by limiting the evidence that may be presented to the PRRA officer. The limitation is found in paragraph 113(a) of the IRPA
...
[13] As I read paragraph 113(a),
it is based on the premise that a negative refugee determination by the RPD must be respected by the PRRA officer
, unless there is new evidence of facts that might have affected the outcome of the RPD hearing if the evidence had been presented to the RPD.
[Emphasis added.]
[25]
The role of a PRAA officer is markedly different from that of the RAD. As Justice Gagné observed in
Singh
:
[50]
A PRRA officer is not a quasi-judicial body, nor does he or she have an appellate function when faced with a RPD decision.
The PRRA officer is an employee of the Minister, acting within his or her employer's discretion (insofar as it is circumscribed by the Act and the Regulations).
The PRRA officer must give deference to the RPD's determination of the claim, to the extent that the facts remain unchanged from the time it had rendered its decision. Instead, the PRRA officer is specifically looking as to whether
new
evidence has come to life since the RPD's rejection of the claim for determining a risk of persecution, a danger of torture, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.
[Emphasis added.]
[26]
This may be contrasted with the function of the RAD, which is a quasi-judicial appellate body that is intended by Parliament to conduct a "full fact-based appeal" of decisions of the RPD. A "full fact-based appeal" requires that the rules of evidence be applied with a measure of flexibility, especially given the strict timelines faced by refugee claimants (
Singh
at paras 53-56; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 37)
singh
is currently before the Federal Court of Appeal. I acknowledge that the application of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria remains unsettled pending the decision of higher courts (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 45; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 40-44). I nevertheless continue to hold the view that the RAD commits a reviewable error when it applies the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria without modification to determine the admissibility of additional evidence submitted on appeal (
Singh
;
Katchatourian
; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[27]
I am unable to say whether the application of a more flexible test for the admission of evidence would have changed the outcome of the appeal. The application for judicial review must therefore be allowed on this ground as well.
VI.
Conclusion
[28]
The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted to a differently-constituted panel of the RAD for re-determination.
[29]
The standard of review to be applied by this Court when reviewing the RAD's determination of its own standard of review is before the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The application of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria to determining the admissibility of additional evidence under s 110(4) of the IRPA is before the Federal Court of Appeal in
Singh
. I therefore agree with the parties that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to certify a question for appeal in this case.
JUDGMENT
[30]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted to a differently-constituted panel of the RAD for re-determination. No question is certified for appeal.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Fothergill
[Traduction]: Monsieur Sharof Shukurov a présenté une demande de contrôle judiciaire en application de l'article 72 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR]. Il conteste le rejet par la Section d'appel des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la SAR] de son appel interjeté à l'encontre d'une décision rendue par la Section de la protection des réfugiés [la SPR]. La SPR a conclu que M. Shukurov n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention suivant l'article 96 de la LIPR ni celle de personne à protéger suivant le paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, j'ai conclu que la SAR n'a pas appliqué la bonne norme de contrôle à la décision de la SPR ni le bon critère pour établir l'admissibilité d'éléments de preuve supplémentaires présentés en appel. Je ne puis affirmer si le résultat aurait été le même si la norme et le critère appropriés avaient été appliqués, et par conséquent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie.
II.
Le contexte
[3]
Monsieur Shukurov est un citoyen de l'Ouzbékistan. Sa demande d'asile était fondée sur les affirmations suivantes:
• Monsieur Shukurov était gérant d'hôtel à Samarkand, en Ouzbékistan. En janvier 2013, un policier a téléphoné afin de réserver la piscine et le sauna de l'hôtel dans le but de divertir ses invités. Monsieur Shukurov a obtempéré et a pris en note la réservation.
• Le propriétaire de l'hôtel a vu la réservation et a reconnu le nom du policier. Se fiant à son expérience passée, le propriétaire craignait que le policier ne paie pas pour utiliser la piscine et le sauna. Il a donc pris des mesures afin d'installer des pancartes indiquant que la piscine et le sauna étaient hors d'usage.
• Lorsque le policier est arrivé avec ses invités et qu'il s'est rendu compte qu'il ne pourrait pas utiliser le sauna ou la piscine, il s'est fâché contre M. Shukurov. Ce dernier, qui n'était pas au courant des mesures prises par le propriétaire de l'hôtel, ne pouvait pas donner d'explication.
• Deux jours après l'incident, le policier a demandé à M. Shukurov un montant équivalent à 5 000 $ afin de l'indemniser pour l'embarras qui lui avait été causé devant ses invités. Quand M. Shukurov a protesté, le policier l'a menacé de porter de fausses accusations criminelles contre lui.
• Monsieur Shukurov s'est plié aux exigences du policier et a versé un paiement initial de 1 000 $. Le policier a dit qu'il s'attendait à ce que le reste soit payé en versements mensuels de 500 $.
• Monsieur Shukurov s'est adressé à un autre policier et à un poursuivant public afin d'expliquer sa situation difficile et de déposer une plainte. Il s'est fait dire par ces fonctionnaires qu'une plainte ne servirait à rien et que le policier serait protégé par d'autres fonctionnaires, et que ce genre d'extorsion était monnaie courante.
• Monsieur Shukurov a alors décidé de quitter le pays. Le 24 février 2013, il a présenté une demande visant à obtenir un visa canadien. Il a continué de verser au policier des montants mensuels jusqu'à ce qu'il arrive au Canada le 14 mai 2013.
[4]
Monsieur Shukurov a présenté une demande d'asile le 13 juin 2013. La SPR a rejeté sa demande d'asile le 21 novembre 2013. Monsieur Shukurov a ensuite interjeté appel de la décision devant la SAR. L'appel a été rejeté le 28 juillet 2014.
[5]
Le 11 août 2014, M. Shukurov a présenté une demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire devant la Cour. L'autorisation a été accordée le 12 mars 2015.
III.
La décision de la SAR
[6]
Monsieur Shukurov a présenté des éléments de preuve supplémentaires en appui à son appel conformément au paragraphe 110(4) de la LIPR. La SAR s'est fondée sur le jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], et a rejeté tous ces documents sauf un, en raison de ses réserves quant à leur provenance et leur authenticité. L'appel a donc été instruit au vu du dossier des procédures devant la SPR, des observations des parties, du témoignage de M. Shukurov et d'un document additionnel.
[7]
Monsieur Shukurov a soutenu devant la SAR que la décision de la SPR comportait trois lacunes: a) la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle il n'y avait aucun lien entre le risque auquel s'exposait M. Shukurov et les motifs d'obtention du statut de réfugié énoncés dans la Convention; b) l'évaluation défavorable de la SPR quant à la crédibilité, fondée sur une absence d'éléments de preuve corroborants; et c) les inférences défavorables tirées par la SPR en raison d'incohérences observées dans le témoignage de vive voix de M. Shukurov et le rejet par la SPR des explications fournies par M. Shukurov à l'égard de ces incohérences.
[8]
La SAR s'est fondée sur le jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], pour étayer sa conclusion selon laquelle la norme applicable aux appels concernant des questions mixtes de fait et de droit est celle de la décision raisonnable.
[9]
La SPR a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas de lien entre le risque auquel était exposé M. Shukurov et les critères permettant de reconnaître la qualité de réfugié, parce que les menaces du policier et l'extorsion pratiquée par ce dernier ne constituaient pas de la persécution au sens de la Convention. Lors de l'examen de cette conclusion, la SAR a souligné que M. Shukurov n'avait aucunement exprimé des opinions de quelque façon que ce soit au sujet de la corruption du policier qui seraient perçues comme des opinions politiques contre le gouvernement. De plus, la SPR a estimé non crédible la preuve que M. Shukurov avait présentée afin de démontrer qu'il était une « personne recherchée » en Ouzbékistan. La SPR a conclu que la décision de la SPR était raisonnable.
[10]
La SAR a ensuite examiné la conclusion défavorable de la SPR concernant la crédibilité de M. Shukurov. Elle a fait remarquer que la SPR avait cerné un certain nombre de questions concernant la provenance des documents présentés par M. Shukurov, notamment la façon dont il les avait reçus au Canada. La SAR a conclu qu'il était raisonnable pour la SPR d'insister pour qu'il présente une preuve corroborante et d'attribuer peu de valeur probante, voire aucune, aux documents quand cette preuve se faisait attendre. La SAR a admis que l'absence de documents corroborants ne constituerait pas à elle seule un motif de rejeter la crédibilité de M. Shukurov. Toutefois, vu les incohérences relevées dans le témoignage de vive voix de M. Shukurov, la SAR a conclu encore une fois que la conclusion de la SPR était raisonnable.
[11]
Enfin, la SAR a souligné que la SPR avait donné à M. Shukurov la possibilité de répondre aux réserves de la SPR. Celui-ci n'a cependant pas été en mesure de se souvenir de faits clés parce qu'il les avait « oublié[s] ». La SAR a conclu qu'il était loisible à la SPR de conclure que le récit des événements donné par M. Shukurov n'était pas raisonnable et de s'attendre à recevoir des rapports médicaux si M. Shukurov souffrait de pertes de mémoire.
[12]
La SAR a confirmé la décision de la SPR selon laquelle M. Shukurov n'avait ni qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger suivant les articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR, et elle a rejeté l'appel.
IV.
Les questions en litige
[13]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève les questions suivantes:
A. La SAR a-t-elle appliqué la mauvaise norme de contrôle à la décision de la SPR?
B. La SAR a-t-elle appliqué le mauvais critère pour établir l'admissibilité d'éléments de preuve additionnels présentés en appel?
V.
Analyse
A.
La SAR a-t-elle appliqué la mauvaise norme de contrôle à la décision de la SPR?
[14]
La SAR est un tribunal d'appel relativement nouveau. Le droit n'est pas encore fixé en ce qui concerne la norme de contrôle que la Cour doit appliquer aux décisions où la SAR choisit quelle norme de contrôle elle applique. La Cour d'appel fédérale est actuellement saisie de l'appel du jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Jusqu'à ce que la question soit réglée par des cours supérieures, je souscris à « l'approche pragmatique » adoptée par le juge Martineau. Voici ce que le juge Martineau a fait remarquer au paragraphe 37 du jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]:
[37] [...] Pour l'heure, diverses approches semblent possibles, mais ce qui est clair cependant, c'est que l'option retenue par la SAR (approche calquée sur la révision judiciaire) n'est pas une issue acceptable en droit. Même en appliquant la norme moins exigeante de la raisonnabilité, j'arrive donc au même résultat final que mes collègues qui ont appliqué la norme plus sévère de la décision correcte. Il y a lieu d'intervenir en l'espèce. De cette façon, le choix de la norme de contrôle appropriée n'a pas un caractère déterminant dans ce dossier [...].
[15]
Dans bon nombre de jugements récents, j'ai examiné la jurisprudence de la Cour concernant les questions en litige soulevées dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]
;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
.
D'après l'analyse figurant dans ces jugements, j'estime que la SAR commet une erreur lorsqu'elle examine les conclusions de la SPR selon la norme de la décision raisonnable et qu'elle n'effectue pas sa propre appréciation de la preuve. Même s'il n'y a pas unanimité sur ce point (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), la plupart des juges de la Cour sont parvenus à une même conclusion ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 41; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 47 et 54;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 16;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53).
[16]
Certains juges de la Cour ont conclu que la SAR ne commet pas d'erreur susceptible de contrôle lorsqu'elle applique la norme de la décision raisonnable à des conclusions reposant purement sur la crédibilité ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Cependant, comme l'a expliqué le juge Noël dans le jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 32, la Cour ne confirmera l'application de la norme de la décision raisonnable par la SAR aux conclusions de la SPR fondées sur la crédibilité que lorsque la SAR a manifestement fait sa propre évaluation de la preuve. C'est aussi l'essentiel du jugement prononcé par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 37, où celui-ci souligne que, dans les affaires où il est question de conclusions purement fondées sur la crédibilité, la question ne vise pas à déterminer quelle norme a été appliquée, mais plutôt à « établir si la SAR a procédé à une appréciation indépendante de la preuve dans son ensemble ». J'estime, par conséquent, que l'obligation qu'a la SAR de procéder à une évaluation indépendante de la preuve s'applique aux questions de crédibilité; toutefois, dans les cas où aucune audience n'est tenue devant la SAR, il faudra peut-être faire preuve de retenue à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR sur la crédibilité qui sont fondées sur le comportement d'un témoin devant le tribunal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 12).
[17]
En l'espèce, voici ce que la SAR a déclaré au sujet de la norme de contrôle applicable aux décisions de la SPR:
[...] Le conseil a soutenu dans ces observations que [traduction] « la SPR est tenue de (ré)examiner la preuve présentée à la SPR et de se faire sa propre opinion pour évaluer la décision ». Il semblerait que le conseil voulait dire que la SAR doit examiner l'ensemble de la preuve. Je suis d'accord si c'est ce que l'appelant a fait valoir.
Dans la présente affaire, les questions à trancher doivent être examinées selon la norme de la décision raisonnable. Selon <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le caractère raisonnable tient « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel » ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[18]
Cet énoncé est ambigu et semble incohérent en soi. Je ne suis pas convaincu que la SAR a bien compris son obligation d'effectuer une évaluation complète de la demande d'asile de M. Shukurov fondée sur les faits. La SAR a examiné la décision de la SPR à la lumière de la norme de la décision raisonnable énoncée dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , et elle s'est prononcée sur la question de savoir si chacune des conclusions de la SPR appartenait aux issues possibles acceptables au regard des faits et du droit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 47). La SAR s'est incorrectement fondée sur l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et son application de la norme de la décision raisonnable est confirmée dans l'énoncé suivant figurant dans sa décision:
Le conseil a fait valoir que la jurisprudence exige que la SAR examine l'ensemble de la preuve à sa disposition. C'est ce que j'ai fait et je conclus que la conclusion et la décision de la SPR sont raisonnables et satisfont au critère énoncé ci-dessus [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Compte tenu de ce qui précède, je conclus que la décision de la SPR est raisonnable.
[19]
Il est donc clair que la SAR n'a pas effectué une évaluation indépendante de la preuve, fondée sur les faits. La SAR est un tribunal d'appel et elle commet une erreur susceptible de contrôle lorsqu'elle adopte la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable dans le cadre de l'exercice de sa juridiction d'appel ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 7). Bien que la SAR puisse énoncer incorrectement la norme de contrôle applicable tout en effectuant une évaluation indépendante de la preuve, pour les motifs susmentionnés, je conclus que ce n'est pas ce qui s'est produit en l'espèce. La demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être accueillie.
B.
La SAR a-t-elle appliqué le mauvais critère pour établir l'admissibilité d'éléments de preuve additionnels présentés en appel?
[20]
Les questions concernant l'admissibilité d'éléments de preuve additionnels présentés à la SAR sont assujetties à un contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (

]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 37).
[21]
Monsieur Shukurov conteste le fait que la SAR se soit fondée sur l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> de la Cour d'appel fédérale pour établir si des éléments de preuve additionnels devraient être autorisés en appel. L'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> portait sur la question de l'admissibilité de nouveaux éléments de preuve dans le contexte d'un examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR). La SAR a décrit l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> comme étant « l'arrêt-clé sur les nouveaux éléments de preuve », mais elle n'a pas expliqué les raisons pour lesquelles les critères applicables à l'admissibilité de nouveaux éléments de preuve dans le contexte d'un ERAR devraient également s'appliquer à un appel interjeté devant la SAR.
[22]
Monsieur Shukurov souligne que dans les jugements
Singh
et
Khachatourian,
la Cour a conclu que les critères énoncés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne devraient pas être appliqués automatiquement lorsqu'il s'agit de déterminer si des éléments de preuve additionnels peuvent être présentés à la SAR. Il affirme que, même si la SAR avait le droit d'appliquer les critères exposés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'application de ceux-ci par la SAR était déraisonnable puisque son analyse du caractère substantiel et de la crédibilité de la preuve comportait des lacunes.
[23]
Le ministre souligne que le libellé des dispositions relatives aux nouveaux éléments de preuve dans le contexte d'un ERAR (alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR) et dans le contexte de la SAR (paragraphe 110(4) de la LIPR) est très similaire, et qu'il était donc raisonnable que la SAR applique les critères exposés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> pour établir si des éléments de preuve additionnels pouvaient être admis en preuve devant la SAR. Le ministre se fonde sur le jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  récemment prononcé par le juge Mosley.
[24]
En outre, la jurisprudence de la Cour sur cette question est divergente. Comme je l'ai affirmé dans le jugement <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la similarité des dispositions ne signifie pas nécessairement que les critères exposés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s'appliquent à l'admission d'un élément de preuve additionnel dans un appel devant la SAR. Un appel interjeté devant la SAR et un ERAR ont des objectifs distincts. La Cour d'appel l'a reconnu dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[12] La demande d'ERAR présentée par un demandeur d'asile débouté
ne constitue pas un appel
ni un réexamen de la décision de la SPR de rejeter une demande d'asile. Néanmoins, une demande d'ERAR peut nécessiter l'examen de quelques-uns ou de la totalité des mêmes points de fait ou de droit qu'une demande d'asile.
Dans de tels cas, il y a un risque évident de multiplication inutile, voire abusive, des recours. La LIPR atténue ce risque en limitant les preuves qui peuvent être présentées à l'agent d'ERAR. Cette limite se trouve à l'alinéa 113
a) de la LIPR [...]
[13] Selon son interprétation de l'alinéa 113a),
cet alinéa repose sur l'idée que l'agent d'ERAR doit prendre acte de la décision de la SPR de rejeter la demande d'asile
, à moins que des preuves nouvelles soient survenues depuis le rejet, qui auraient pu conduire la SPR à statuer autrement si elle en avait eu connaissance. [...]
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[25]
Le rôle d'un agent chargé de l'ERAR est très différent de celui de la SAR. La juge Gagné a tenu les propos suivants dans le jugement
Singh
:
[50] L'agent d'ERAR n'est pas un tribunal administratif quasi judiciaire et il n'exerce pas non plus le rôle d'une juridiction d'appel à l'égard des décisions de la SPR. L'agent d'ERAR est un employé du ministre, dont les actions relèvent du pouvoir discrétionnaire de son employeur (dans la mesure où ce pouvoir est circonscrit par la Loi et le Règlement). L'agent d'ERAR doit faire preuve de retenue à l'égard d'une décision de la SPR, dans la mesure où les faits restent inchangés depuis le moment où elle l'a rendue. L'agent d'ERAR cherche plutôt précisément à savoir si de
nouveaux
éléments de preuve sont mis au jour depuis la décision défavorable de la SPR pour déterminer s'il y a un risque de persécution, un risque de torture, une menace pour la vie ou un risque de subir des peines ou traitements cruels et inusités.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[26]
Il en va différemment de la SAR, qui est un organe d'appel quasi judiciaire que le législateur a conçu pour qu'il procède à un « appel fondé sur les faits » des décisions de la SPR. Un « appel fondé sur les faits » commande que les règles de preuve soient appliquées avec une certaine souplesse, particulièrement compte tenu des délais stricts auxquels doivent se conformer les demandeurs d'asile (
Singh
, aux paragraphes 53 à 56; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 37) La Cour d'appel fédérale est actuellement saisie de l'appel du jugement
Singh
. Je reconnais que l'application des critères exposés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> demeure une question non réglée jusqu'à ce qu'une cour supérieure la tranche (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 45; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 40 à 44). Je crois toujours néanmoins que la SAR commet une erreur susceptible de contrôle en appliquant sans les modifier les critères exposés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> pour établir l'admissibilité d'éléments de preuve additionnels présentés en appel (
Singh
;
Katchatourian
; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[27]
Je ne puis affirmer si l'application d'un critère plus souple à l'égard de l'admissibilité de la preuve aurait changé l'issue de l'appel. Il y a donc lieu d'accueillir également la demande de contrôle judiciaire pour ce motif.
VI.
Conclusion
[28]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, et l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal de la SAR différemment constitué pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision.
[29]
Dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale doit se prononcer sur la norme de contrôle que notre Cour doit appliquer lorsqu'elle examine quelle norme de contrôle la SAR a arrêté, et dans l'affaire
Singh
, elle doit se prononcer sur l'application des critères exposés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> afin d'établir l'admissibilité d'éléments de preuve additionnels en vertu du paragraphe 110(4) de la LIPR. Par conséquent, je suis d'accord avec les parties pour dire qu'il n'est ni nécessaire ni approprié en l'espèce de certifier une question à des fins d'appel.
JUGEMENT
[30]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie et l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal de la SAR différemment constitué afin qu'il rende une nouvelle décision. Aucune question n'est certifiée à des fins d'appel.
Application allowed.
