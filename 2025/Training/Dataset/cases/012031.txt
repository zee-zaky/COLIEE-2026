Strickland, J.
: This is the judicial review of a decision of the Appeals Division, Recourse Directorate, Canada Border Services Agency, as delegate of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (the Minister), determining that currency seized under the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, SC 2000, c 17 (the Act) shall be held as forfeit. This judicial review is brought pursuant to section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC 1985, c F-7.
Background
[2]
Kangaratnam Satheesan (the Applicant) was born in Sri Lanka and is a citizen of Germany. On August 12, 2010 he arrived in Canada on a flight from Germany and failed to report that he was in possession of currency having a value exceeding CAN$10,000, the declaration of which is required by subsection 12(1) of the Act and subsection 2(1) of the
Cross-border Currency and Monetary Instruments Reporting Regulations
SOR/2002-412. When examined by a Canada Border Services Agency officer (CBSA officer) it was determined that he was importing EUR15,530 and USD$24 (valued at CAN$21,754.53).
[3]
The undeclared currency was seized by the CBSA officer in accordance with subsection 18(1) of the Act. It was held with no terms of release, pursuant to subsection 18(2) of the Act, as the CBSA officer had formed the opinion that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the undeclared currency was or may be the proceeds of crime.
[4]
On August 18, 2010 the Applicant, in accordance with section 25 of the Act, requested a decision of the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) of the Act had been contravened. This was done by way of a Notice of Objection which attached, but did not make reference to, what appeared to be a February 1, 2010 contract of sale of a business by the Applicant to a named buyer for a purchase price of EUR10,000, and a bank withdrawal slip dated August 11, 2010 in the amount of EUR2000, both written in German. In that correspondence the Applicant stated, amongst other things, that his limited knowledge of English had prevented him from understanding the declaration form and understanding what amount of money he could import without declaring it.
[5]
On October 29, 2010 an adjudicator of the Appeals Division, Recourse Directorate, CBSA, wrote to the Applicant acknowledging his request for a decision of the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) of the Act had been contravened, setting out in detail the grounds for the seizure of the undeclared currency and attaching a copy of the Narrative Report prepared by the CBSA officer who had examined the Applicant at his port of entry into Canada. The Applicant was advised to provide further documentary evidence to link all of the seized funds to the earnings from the pizza shop and that, in the absence of such sufficient evidence, the reasons to suspect the currency is the proceeds of crime would remain.
[6]
The Applicant provided a lengthy response which was received by CBSA on November 22, 2010. This stated that the purchaser of the Applicant's pizza shop had paid the EUR10,000 purchase price in EUR500 bills which the Applicant kept in his apartment. It also enclosed translated English excerpts of the purchase agreement as well as the Applicant's turnover tax calculation for 2008 and addressed the other matters raised in the prior CBSA correspondence. The letter also stated that the Applicant had requested an interpreter when being examined by the CBSA officer at the port of entry but that his request had been denied. The result of this denial being that his understanding of the questions put to him by the officer was unclear, his explanations accordingly confused and that the CBSA officer had interpreted them incorrectly as contradictory. The Applicant sent a follow up letter on January 17, 2011.
[7]
By letter of March 30, 2011 the adjudicator requested a copy of the entire untranslated purchase agreement for the pizza shop and went on to state that upon initial review of the documentation that had then been submitted by the Applicant that it did not appear to provide a complete paper trail linking the seized funds to the proceeds of the sale of the pizza shop and that no documentation had been provided to show the source of the seized funds which exceeded the EUR10,000 purchase price. The adjudicator advised that to dispel the reasons to suspect that the seized currency is the proceeds of crime that "sufficient documentary evidence must be provided to link the entire amount of the seized funds to a legitimate source". The letter also stated that language did not appear to be a contributing factor in the Applicant's failure to declare the seized currency or to answer the CBSA officer's questions concerning the currency. The Applicant was asked to provide further documentary evidence to link the EUR10,000 of the seized funds to the sale of the pizza shop, to show that the remaining seized funds were withdrawn from the claimant's savings account and the source of the funds in that account.
[8]
On May 4, 2011 the Applicant provided the pizza shop purchase agreement and the withdrawal receipt noting that both had previously been submitted. He stated that the information he had previously provided should serve to establish that he had worked hard and saved his money. As to the portion of the seized funds not addressed by the withdrawal receipt and the sale of the pizza shop, he stated that this came from smaller previous withdrawals from the bank and money kept on site at the pizza shop.
[9]
By letter of June 10, 2011 the adjudicator accepted that the Applicant appeared to have sold his pizza shop for EUR10,000 on February 1, 2010, the bank withdrawal for EUR2000 on August 11, 2010, and, that his tax documents showed his income in 2008 but stated that there was "still insufficient documentary evidence to link the seized funds to the sale of the business and the claimant's earnings". Further, as no records of his living expenses had been provided it could not be determined how much of the business sale proceeds and his other earnings remained once those living expense were taken into account. The Applicant was again asked to provide a complete paper trail to link the seized funds to the sale of the pizza shop and his earnings.
[10]
The Applicant responded by letter of July 12, 2011 providing a letter from the purchaser of the pizza shop confirming that he had paid the purchase price of EUR10,000 by way of twenty bills of EUR500 each.
[11]
By letter of July 26, 2011 the adjudicator acknowledged the Applicant's letter of July 12, 2011 but stated that it appeared that there was still insufficient evidence to link the seized funds to the sale of the pizza shop and the Applicant's earnings.
[12]
More specifically, the funds received from the sale of the shop were less than the amount seized and there was no documentation linking the seized funds to that source. Further, based on the other documents submitted, the amount claimed as earned in 2008 would have been received two years before the seizure and it could not be confirmed that any of the seized funds came from those earnings. The documents pertaining to the business assessment for 2008 and 2009 did not appear to provide evidence relating to the origin of the seized funds and the bank withdrawal slip showed an amount that was less than the amount seized and did not provide any information as to the original source of those funds. In addition, the Applicant's living expenses were not accounted for in connection with the proceeds realized from the sale of the pizza shop and his earnings.
[13]
On October 21, 2011 the adjudicator prepared a Case Synopsis and Reasons for Decision. This set out the evidence and submissions and recommended that the Minister find, pursuant to subsection 27(1) of the Act, that the Applicant had contravened subsection 12(1) of the Act by failing to report the imported currency and that the seized funds be held a forfeit pursuant to subsection 29(1)(c).
[14]
The Manager, Appeals Directorate, Recourse Director, CBSA, as the Minister's delegate (Manager), accepted the recommendations. By letter of December 7, 2011 she informed the Applicant of the Minister's decision (the Decision). By way of this judicial review the Applicant seeks an order setting aside the Decision and returning the matter for redetermination.
The Decision under Review
[15]
The Decision states that pursuant to subsection 27 of the Act, the Manager, as delegate for the Minister, has decided that there has been a contravention of the Act with respect to the currency seized (subsection 12(1)) and that under the provisions of section 29 of the Act, the seized currency shall be held as forfeit.
[16]
The reasons stated in the Decision recite the CBSA officer's initial grounds for seizing the currency and suspecting that it was the proceeds of crime as originally recorded the Narrative Report. These included that:
• The Applicant and his sister both left Sri Lanka as refugees at a time when Tamil Tigers were also fleeing Sri Lanka;
• The Applicant had travelled from Germany to Canada after travelling to Sri Lanka a month earlier;
• He could not explain how he could afford tickets to visit both Sri Lanka and Canada;
• He gave conflicting stories regarding the purpose of his trip and provided limited details about his visit;
• He gave conflicting stories regarding the person meeting him at the airport;
• He was evasive and nervous when asked about the Tamil Tigers;
• The seized currency was not wrapped and the notes were not all facing the same way, indicating it was not obtained from a bank;
• The currency had not been reported to German customs;
• There were discrepancies in his story regarding travel, employment and the source of the funds;
• He had difficulty explaining how the currency came into his possession and had no documents proving its origin;
• His business practice of dealing in cash and using multiple banks suggests an attempt to avoid the banks' reporting requirements;
• He gave contradictory statements concerning the reason he was going to give his sister the money;
• He could not provide information about his personal finances; and
• He was not aware of the amount of currency in his possession and did not express concern about its seizure.
[17]
The reasons then describe the Applicant's submissions in requesting the appeal and responds to each in turn. With respect to his assertion that he did not understand English well enough to understand the declaration form requirements, the Manager states that the CBSA officer had specifically stated in her report that there was no language problem. The CBSA officer had asked if the Applicant fully understood everything on the declaration card and that the Applicant stated that he did and that he knew how to properly declare. Further, the Manager indicated that if the Applicant did not understand the questions on the declaration card or the questions being asked by the CBSA officer, then it was incumbent upon him to bring that to the CBSA officer's attention, at the time, so that any necessary assistance could have been provided. The Manager concluded that language was not a contributing factor in the Applicant's failure to report the currency in his possession.
[18]
As to the seized funds, while the Applicant submitted that the seized funds came from the sale of his pizza shop and other business earnings, the Manager was not satisfied that the evidence the Applicant had submitted established the legitimate origins of the currency. The sales agreement indicated the pizza shop sold for EUR10,000 on February 1, 2010. However, those funds were less than the amount seized even when combined with the EUR2,000 personal withdrawal confirmed by receipt. There was no documentary evidence linking the proceeds from the sale to the seized funds.
[19]
The Applicant's business tax return for 2008 showed that his business generated EUR200,171 in revenue. The Manager pointed out that these earnings were received two years prior to the date of seizure and there was no documentary evidence linking the proceeds of the business to the seized funds. The withdrawal receipt for EUR2000 similarly did not provide any information regarding the original source of those withdrawn funds. Further, no documentation had been provided to demonstrate the Applicant's current living expenses. As a result, the Manager was unable to determine how much of the seized funds came from the suggested legitimate origin after the Applicant's living expenses had been taken into consideration. Given this, the Minister declined to exercise his discretion to release the funds from forfeiture.
Issues
[20]
The Applicant submits that there was a failure of natural justice as an interpreter was not provided to the Applicant when one was requested at the port of entry, and, that the Minister failed to reasonably exercise his section 29 discretion with respect to forfeiture.
[21]
I would rephrase the issues as follows:
a. What is the appropriate standard of review?
b. Was there a breach of procedural fairness?
c. Did the Minister's delegate err in determining the funds as forfeit?
Positions of the Parties
The Applicant
[22]
The Applicant submits that he speaks English with difficulty and that he requested a German interpreter several times when he was being interviewed by the CBSA officer at the port of entry. Because he was not provided with an interpreter when he requested one and because his command of English was insufficient to effectively communicate answers to questions put to him by the CBSA officer and because negative inferences were drawn from the alleged inconsistencies in the Applicant's answers, there was a breach of procedural fairness amounting to a reviewable error.
[23]
The Applicant further argues the Minster's discretion pursuant to section 29 of the Act was not exercised reasonably.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 1267, the only evidence before the Minister was unverifiable affidavits. In contrast, in this case the Applicant provided verifiable documents including the sale agreement for the pizza shop for EUR10,000; a bank receipt showing a withdrawal of EUR2,000; and, a business tax return showing business revenue of EUR200,171.
[24]
To the Applicant, the Minister was asking for the impossible by insisting on documentary evidence linking the proceeds from the sale of the pizza shop to the seized funds and was therefore unreasonable. It was a cash sale, there is no direct documentary evidence and the Applicant provided reasonably sufficient corroborating documents.
[25]
The Applicant points out that only EUR3,530 is not accounted for after the pizza shop sale agreement and bank withdrawal are considered, a mere 2.5% of the Applicant's 2008 business revenues. Further, it is reasonable to assume the EUR2,000 personal withdrawal and the undocumented EUR3,530 came from his business proceeds. Given the submitted documentation, the Applicant submits that it was not reasonable for the Minister to conclude that he has not been satisfied that the seized funds are not proceeds of crime.
[26]
The Applicant also argues that the Decision is undermined by innuendo linking the Applicant to the Tamil Tigers with no evidence to substantiate the allegation. The Minister's observations and conclusions linking the Applicant to the Tamil Tigers are unreasonable.
The Respondent
[27]
The Respondent emphasizes there is no issue here of whether there was a failure to declare the currency and resultant breach of section 12 of the Act. Any contestation of that finding must be by way of an appeal under section 27 of the Act. This judicial review is only concerned with the Minister's decision under section 29 to keep the currency as forfeit.
[28]
The Respondent submits there was no request for or need of an interpreter by the Applicant when he was being interviewed by the CBSA officer at the port of entry. The record establishes that the Applicant told the CBSA officer that he understood the declaration and that he had signed the card himself, and, in his subsequent submissions he did not deny making those statements. The officer's notes state that the Applicant "had good command of the English language and had no difficulty understanding the questions". This is confirmed by the Narrative Report which is indicative of a lengthy conversation with the Applicant who was able to express himself clearly and in detail in response to the questions asked of him.
[29]
The Respondent points out that in his initial communication to the CBSA, dated August 18, 2010, the Applicant states that he had a limited understanding of English but makes no mention of a refusal to provide translation. This allegation arose only after the Respondent indicated in correspondence of October 29, 2010 that the Applicant understood the questions put to him and should have requested assistance if it was needed. Even if an interpreter had been provided, it would not have changed the outcome of the examination given the Applicant's itinerary, social background, false declaration and behaviour.
[30]
The Respondent denies that there was an association inferred between the Applicant and the Tamil Tigers. The Respondent submits that the record shows that the Applicant denied an association personally with the Tamil Tigers and was questioned as to whether his family sympathised with them even if he did not. His reaction to this topic would have been the same with a translator.
[31]
The Respondent submits that the Decision was reasonable because the three submitted documents did not establish a legitimate source of the seized funds. Funds from the sale of the business a year earlier are not linked by virtue of the sale contract alone to the seized currency. No document linked any income earned in 2008 to the seized currency. The withdrawal receipt was for an amount that was less than the difference between the amount seized and the pizza shop sale proceeds and there was no document to confirm the legitimate origin of the withdrawn funds. The onus is on the Applicant to persuade the Minister that the funds are not the proceeds of crime ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 813) which the Applicant could have done by providing documents normally credible or authoritative enough to connect currency to a legitimate source, such as bank account balances, export declarations from German customs, or wrappers from the bank but declined to do. Therefore, the Minister's Decision was reasonable.
Standard of Review
[32]
Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).
[33]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Court of Appeal indicated the standard of review of the Minister's decisions is reasonableness (at paragraph 25). This approach was followed by this Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paragraph 29.
[34]
In reviewing a Minister's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the decision is not transparent, justifiable, and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 4). It is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 59).
[35]
It is well-established that on the content of procedural fairness, no deference is owed to a tribunal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 43).
Was there a breach of procedural fairness?
[36]
While no deference is owed to tribunals on the content of the duty of fairness, the procedural fairness claim in this case turns on a factual dispute: whether or not the Applicant requested an interpreter. The Respondent denies that a request for an interpreter was made. It does not appear to dispute that if the Applicant did in fact request an interpreter and was denied one, then the duty of fairness would have been violated. This Court is therefore not called upon to determine the content of the duty of fairness.
[37]
Since the dispute is a purely a factual matter, this Court owes deference to the decision-maker entrusted by Parliament to that task, in this case the CBSA Manager as the Minister's delegate ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 46). Simply because the factual finding is relevant to a procedural fairness dispute does not mean that the Court becomes a finder of fact where a reviewing a tribunal that has already considered the issue.
[38]
Here the Manager concluded that language was not a contributing factor in the failure to report the currency i.e. the contravention of subsection 12(1), which contravention she then determines, pursuant to section 27, has occurred. The Manager stated in her reasons that if the Applicant did not understand the questions asked on the declaration card or by the CBSA officer at the port of entry then it was incumbent upon him to have brought this to the CBSA officer's attention, at that time, so that any necessary assistance could be provided. The Manager's implicit finding of fact is, therefore, that the Applicant did not request an interpreter.
[39]
In reaching these conclusions the Manager relied on the Narrative Report of the CBSA officer. This is a detailed seven page report made on the day that the Applicant entered Canada. This states, in part:
Upon his arrival at my counter, SATHEESAN was asked if the bag and belongings he was travelling with were his, if he packed them himself, and if he knew the contents of the bags. SATHEESAN answered yes to all three individual questions. SATHEESAN was asked if there was anything sharp or dangerous in the bag, to which he replied that there was not. SATHEESAN was asked if his bag left Germany with him, SATHEESAN replied yes, SATHEESAN was asked if the E311 card in my hand was his declaration card, he replied yes. He was asked if he fully understood everything on that card. SATHEESAN replied that he had, and knew how to declare properly. An explanation of the examination process was given to SATHEESAN. SATHEESAN did not have any questions.
SATHEESAN had good command of the English language, and had no difficulty listening, understanding and answering questions in English.
[40]
The Narrative Report then proceeds, for the next six pages, to describe the verbal examination of the Applicant that followed and the Applicant's responses to the many questions put to him.
[41]
The Applicant submits that he requested both water and an interpreter. The Narrative Report confirms that the Applicant did ask for a glass of water. The CBSA Officer recorded that she told him that she would get it for him but that it was important that he answer her questions. She then asked her question again. There is no indication as to whether or not she provided the requested water. The Narrative Report makes no reference to a request for an interpreter.
[42]
In his August 18, 2010 Notice of Objection the Applicant stated that he did not know English well enough to allow him to understand the declaration form clearly and that he was unsure of the amount of money he was permitted to import without declaring it. In his letter of November 22, 2010 the Applicant, for the first time, asserted that he had asked for an interpreter but that this had been denied by the CBSA officer on the basis that the Applicant's English was sufficient.
[43]
The Manager did not accept the Applicant's submission that he had asked for and been denied an interpreter. She preferred and accepted the evidence of the CBSA officer and, based on that evidence, concluded that language was not a contributing factor in the Applicant's failure to report the importation of the seized currency. She also accepted as fact that the Applicant had a good command of the English language and had no difficulty listening to, understanding and answering questions in English as stated in the Narrative Report.
[44]
As discussed above, the Manager is entitled to considerable deference from a reviewing court on factual findings ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paragraph 46). I see no reason to disturb her implicit finding that there was no request for an interpreter as it is transparent, justifiable and intelligible and is not outside the range of reasonable outcomes based on the evidence on the record before her.
[45]
Since he has not successfully impugned that factual finding, the Applicant has no basis to argue that there was a breach of procedural fairness amounting to a reviewable error.
Did the Minister's delegate err in keeping the funds as forfeit?
[46]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, funds were seized and forfeited because Mr. Sellathurai failed to declare them to a customs officer as he was required to do by section 12 of the Act. It was conceded that, at the time of the seizure, there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the funds were proceeds of crime or were to be used in the funding of terrorism. The issue before the Federal Court of Appeal was whether the Minister properly exercised his discretion in refusing to return the funds to Mr. Sellathurai.
[47]
There the Court of Appeal described what is at issue in a judicial review of a section 29 decision of the Minister:
[49] Where the Minister repeatedly asks for proof that the seized currency has a legitimate source, as he did in this case, it is a fair conclusion that he made his decision on the basis of the applicant's evidence on that issue. The underlying logic is unassailable. If the currency can be shown to have a legitimate source, then it cannot be proceeds of crime.
[50] If, on the other hand, the Minister is not satisfied that the seized currency comes from a legitimate source, it does not mean that the funds are proceeds of crime. It simply means that the Minister has not been satisfied that they are not proceeds of crime. The distinction is important because it goes directly to the nature of the decision which the Minister is asked to make under section 29 which, as noted earlier in these reasons, is an application for relief from forfeiture. The issue is not whether the Minister can show reasonable grounds to suspect that the seized funds are proceeds of crime. The only issue is whether the applicant can persuade the Minister to exercise his discretion to grant relief from forfeiture by satisfying him that the seized funds are not proceeds of crime. Without precluding the possibility that the Minister can be satisfied on this issue in other ways, the obvious approach is to show that the funds come from a legitimate source. That is what the Minister requested in this case, and when Mr. Sellathurai was unable to satisfy him on the issue, the Minister was entitled to decline to exercise his discretion to grant relief from forfeiture.
[48]
The Court of Appeal also held that there is no standard of proof in section 29 decisions separate from the standard of review of reasonableness:
[51] This leads to the question which was argued at length before us. What standard of proof must the applicant meet in order to satisfy the Minister that the seized funds are not proceeds of crime? In my view, this question is resolved by the issue of standard of review. The Minister's decision under section 29 is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. It follows that if the Minister's conclusion as to the legitimacy of the source of the funds is reasonable, having regard to the evidence in the record before him, then his decision is not reviewable. Similarly, if the Minister's conclusion is unreasonable, then the decision is reviewable and the Court should intervene. It is neither necessary nor useful to attempt to define in advance the nature and kind of proof which the applicant must put before the Minister.
[49]
In this case, the Minister followed the approach described in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, by repeatedly asking for documentary proof of a legitimate source of the seized funds. Therefore, here the question is whether it was reasonable for the Minister to conclude, based on the evidence before him, that he was not satisfied as to the legitimate source of the funds.
[50]
While in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the only evidence tendered was unverifiable affidavits, in my view in this case it was also reasonable for the Minister to conclude that the documents submitted by the Applicant were insufficient to establish the legitimacy of the funds. The only funds for which a direct and potentially legitimate source was identified were those realized from the sale of the pizza shop. However, there is no certainty that the twenty EUR500 bills seized were, in fact, the proceeds of the sale of that enterprise. That is, there is no linkage of that cash to that transaction. Further, in the absence of other financial documents showing the Applicant's spending in the intervening two years, it was reasonable for the Minister to decline to assume the entire EUR10,000 was preserved intact as urged by the Applicant.
[51]
The Minister also asked repeatedly for documentation linking the EUR2000 that the Applicant withdrew from his bank account to a legitimate source. The bank withdrawal does not indicate the initial source of the EUR2000, that is, whether it was from the 2008 revenue from the pizza shop or otherwise. This is something that records from the same bank would presumably have disclosed and which could have been provided by the Applicant. The Applicant also declined to produce any records that might have shown that the earnings from his business have sustained him since 2008 and were the legitimate source of the EUR2000 that he withdrew from his personal account.
[52]
As to the income tax records, these show that the business earned money, but do not show how the seized money is connected to those earnings. In short, the Applicant failed to establish a link between the seized funds and a legitimate source of same.
[53]
I am also unable to accept the Applicant's argument that the Minister asked for the impossible and, therefore, that the Decision is unreasonable. The onus is on the Applicant to persuade the Minister to exercise his discretion to grant relief from forfeiture by satisfying him that the seized funds are not the proceeds of crime. The Respondent argued that the Minister sought the impossible as, in the case of the cash sale, little short of an uninterrupted, documented serial number trail of the EUR500 bills from the time they were received as payment for the pizza shop to the time of the seizure would suffice to link the cash to a legitimate source. At first glance, this argument appears to have some merit. However, when viewed in the context of the very nominal documentation that the Applicant was prepared to provide in response to the Minister's repeated requests, as compared to the records that would normally and therefore reasonably be assumed to exist with respect to business and personal financial transactions, and considering the objects of the Act as described in section 3 (see also <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paragraph 35), I do not think the Minister's request was unreasonable.
[54]
Because the Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to satisfy the Minister that the seized funds are not the proceeds of crime, the Minister reasonably declined to exercise his discretion to grant relief from forfeiture under section 29. The Decision is not reviewable.
[55]
The Applicant also argues that the Decision is undermined by "innuendo" linking the Applicant to the Tamil Tigers and that the Minister's observations and conclusions in that regard are unreasonable. Some of the comments in the record relating the applicant's Tamil ethnicity, viewed in isolation, do give me pause. For example, to find it suspicious that the Applicant fled Sri Lanka at the same time as members of the Tamil Tigers is questionable given that the Applicant was a child at the time and there was a civil war in that country that caused many to flee. Similarly, to suspect the Applicant of illegal activity on the basis that he was visiting a Scarborough neighbourhood "known to be sympathetic to the Tamil Tigers" could be viewed as stereotyping. It also seems reasonable to expect any person being questioned in an airport in relation to terrorism to react in a nervous fashion.
[56]
Here, however, these matters are not relevant because only the Minister's decision made pursuant to section 29 is at issue. There is no really question that the Applicant failed to declare the importation of funds exceeding CAN$10,000. But, because the funds were then seized as forfeit pursuant to subsection 18(1) and were not returned because the CBSA officer had reasonable grounds to suspect that the currency was the proceeds of crime pursuant to subsection 18(2), the only way for the Applicant to challenge the section 18 seizure was to make a section 25 request for a decision of the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) was contravened. If the Minister decided that it was, which he did, then pursuant to subsection 29(1) he may exercise his discretion to provide relief from forfeiture (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[57]
As stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above:
[34] The Minister is only called upon to exercise his discretion under section 29 where he concludes, pursuant to a request made under section 25, that there has in fact been a breach of section 12. Consequently, the starting point for the exercise of the Minister's discretion is that the forfeited currency, which is now in the hands of the Minister of Public Works pursuant to section 22, is, for all legal purposes, property of the Crown: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 557-558, where the following appears:
[...]
[...]
[36] It seems to me to follow from this that the effect of the customs officer's conclusion that he or she had reasonable grounds to suspect that the seized currency was proceeds of crime
is spent
once the breach of section 12 is confirmed by the Minister. The forfeiture is complete and the currency is property of the Crown. The only question remaining for determination under section 29 is whether the Minister will exercise his discretion to grant relief from forfeiture, either by returning the funds themselves or by returning the statutory penalty paid to secure the release of the funds. (Emphasis added)
[58]
Thus, those factors are not relevant. They did not play a role in the determination of the legitimacy of the funds under section 29. In the Decision, the reference to the Tamil Tigers is made only as a part of the rationale for the initial seizure. The portion of the Decision dealing with section 29 is concerned with the documentary evidence provided by the Applicant in an effort to establish the legitimate origins of the seized currency, as described above. In any event, in its submissions the Respondent stated that there was no association inferred between the Applicant himself and the Tamil Tigers.
[59]
As the question of the partial return of the funds was not before the Minister it cannot be considered for the first time on judicial review.
[60]
The Minister's Decision was transparent, justifiable, intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes. The application should therefore be dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[61]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed. No question of general importance for certification has been proposed and none arises.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Strickland
[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision, prise par la Division des appels, Direction des recours, Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, en qualité de déléguée du ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile (le ministre), de maintenir la confiscation des espèces saisies en vertu de la
Loi sur le recyclage des produits de la criminalité et le financement des activités terroristes
, LC 2000, c 17 (la Loi). La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est présentée conformément à l'article 18.1 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC 1985, c F-7.
Contexte
[2]
Kangaratnam Satheesan (le demandeur) est né au Sri Lanka et est citoyen de l'Allemagne. Le 12 août 2010, il est arrivé au Canada en avion, en provenance de l'Allemagne, et il a omis de déclarer qu'il était en possession d'espèces d'une valeur supérieure à 10 000 $CAN, dont la déclaration est obligatoire aux termes du paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi et du paragraphe 2(1) du
Règlement sur la déclaration des mouvements transfrontaliers d'espèces et d'effets
, DORS/2002-412. À la suite d'un examen, une agente de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (agente de l'ASFC) a établi que le demandeur importait 15 530 € et 24 $US (équivalant à 21 754,53 $CAN).
[3]
Les espèces non déclarées ont été saisies par l'agente de l'ASFC en application du paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi. Elles ont été conservées sans conditions quant à leur restitution conformément au paragraphe 18(2) de la Loi, étant donné que l'agente de l'ASFC était d'avis qu'il existait des motifs raisonnables de croire que les espèces non déclarées pouvaient constituer des produits de la criminalité.
[4]
Le 18 août 2010, le demandeur a demandé, conformément à l'article 25 de la Loi, au ministre de décider s'il y avait eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi. Cette demande a été faite au moyen d'un avis d'opposition qui ne mentionnait pas mais comportait en annexe deux documents: ce qui semblait être un contrat de vente, daté du 1er février 2010, d'une entreprise du demandeur à un acheteur nommé au prix de 10 000 €, et un bordereau bancaire daté du 11 août 2010 faisant état d'un retrait d'une somme de 2 000 €, tous deux rédigés en allemand. Le demandeur y expliquait notamment que sa connaissance limitée de l'anglais ne lui avait pas permis de comprendre le formulaire de déclaration et les sommes qu'il pouvait importer sans les déclarer.
[5]
Le 29 octobre 2010, un arbitre de la Division des appels, Direction des recours, ASFC, a envoyé au demandeur une lettre accusant réception de sa demande d'une décision du ministre sur la question de savoir s'il y avait eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi et exposant en détail les motifs de la saisie des espèces non déclarées; était annexée à cette lettre une copie du rapport descriptif établi par l'agente de l'ASFC qui avait interrogé le demandeur au point d'entrée par lequel il était arrivé au Canada. Le demandeur a été invité à fournir d'autres éléments de preuve documentaires pour établir un lien entre l'ensemble des fonds saisis et les bénéfices tirés de la pizzéria. Advenant la présentation d'une preuve insuffisante, les soupçons quant à la provenance criminelle des espèces demeureraient.
[6]
Le demandeur a rédigé une longue réponse que l'ASFC a reçue le 22 novembre 2010. Il y était indiqué que l'acheteur de la pizzéria du demandeur avait payé le prix d'achat de 10 000 € en billets de 500 €, que le demandeur avait conservés dans son logement. Il avait joint à cette réponse des extraits du contrat d'achat traduits en anglais de même que sa déclaration de revenus pour 2008; il traitait aussi d'autres questions soulevées dans sa correspondance antérieure avec l'ASFC. Il était aussi précisé dans la lettre que le demandeur avait demandé les services d'un interprète à l'agente de l'ASFC qui l'a interrogé au point d'entrée, mais que sa demande avait été refusée. À cause de ce refus, il a mal compris les questions que lui posait l'agente; ses explications n'étaient donc pas claires et l'agente de l'ASFC les avait, à tort, jugées contradictoires. Le demandeur a envoyé une lettre de suivi le 17 janvier 2011.
[7]
Dans une lettre datée du 30 mars 2011, l'arbitre a demandé une copie intégrale de la version originale en allemand du contrat d'achat de la pizzéria et a ajouté qu'au moment de l'examen initial des documents qui avaient été soumis par le demandeur, il ne semblait pas exister des traces documentaires complètes permettant d'établir un lien entre les fonds saisis et le produit de la vente de la pizzéria et qu'aucun document n'avait été fourni pour expliquer la source des fonds saisis qui dépassaient le prix d'achat de 10 000 €. L'arbitre l'informait que, pour dissiper les soupçons quant à l'origine criminelle des espèces saisies, [traduction] « des éléments de preuve documentaire suffisants [devaient] être fournis pour rattacher le montant total des fonds saisis à une source légitime ». La lettre précisait aussi que le facteur langue ne semblait pas avoir été à la source de l'omission du demandeur de déclarer les espèces saisies ou de répondre aux questions de l'agente de l'ASFC concernant les espèces en cause. Le demandeur a été invité à fournir des éléments de preuve supplémentaires pour établir un lien entre la somme de 10 000 € des fonds saisis et la vente de la pizzéria et à démontrer que le reste des fonds saisis avait été retiré du compte d'épargne du demandeur et que ce compte était bien la source des fonds.
[8]
Le 4 mai 2011, le demandeur a transmis le contrat d'achat de la pizzéria et le bordereau de retrait, en soulignant que les deux documents avaient déjà été remis. Il déclarait que l'information qu'il avait déjà transmise devrait permettre d'établir qu'il avait travaillé dur et qu'il avait économisé l'argent qu'il possédait. En ce qui concerne la partie des fonds saisis qui n'était pas visée par le bordereau de retrait et la vente de la pizzéria, il a déclaré que ces fonds provenaient de petits retraits antérieurs de la banque et de sommes conservées à la pizzéria.
[9]
Dans une lettre datée du 10 juin 2011, l'arbitre a reconnu que le demandeur semblait avoir vendu sa pizzéria contre 10 000 € le 1er février 2010, qu'il avait retiré 2 000 € de la banque le 11 août 2010 et que ses documents fiscaux indiquaient son revenu pour 2008, mais il a ajouté qu'il [traduction] « manquait encore des éléments de preuve pour établir un lien entre, d'une part, les fonds saisis et, d'autre part, la vente de l'entreprise et l'épargne du demandeur ». De plus, étant donné qu'il n'avait fourni aucun document relatif à ses frais de subsistance, il était impossible d'établir quelle portion du produit de la vente de l'entreprise et du reste de son épargne demeurait après le calcul de ces frais de subsistance. Le demandeur était encore une fois invité à fournir une piste documentaire complète pour rattacher les fonds saisis à la vente de la pizzéria et à ses revenus.
[10]
Le demandeur a répondu dans une lettre datée du 12 juillet 2011, à laquelle était annexée une lettre de l'acheteur de la pizzéria qui confirmait avoir payé 10 000 € au moyen de vingt billets de 500 € chacun.
[11]
Dans une lettre datée du 26 juillet 2011, l'arbitre a accusé réception de la lettre du demandeur datée du 12 juillet 2011, mais a déclaré que la preuve n'était toujours pas suffisante pour permettre de rattacher les fonds saisis à la vente de la pizzéria et aux revenus du demandeur.
[12]
Plus précisément, les fonds reçus de la vente de la pizzéria étaient inférieurs à la somme saisie et aucun document n'établissait de lien entre les fonds saisis et cette source. De plus, selon les autres documents qui avaient été transmis, le revenu déclaré pour 2008 aurait été reçu deux ans avant la saisie et il n'était pas possible de confirmer si une partie des fonds saisis provenait de ce revenu. Les documents relatifs à l'évaluation des activités pour 2008 et 2009 ne semblaient pas démontrer l'origine des fonds saisis et le bordereau de retrait à la banque indiquait un montant inférieur à la somme saisie et ne contenait pas de renseignements sur la source de ces fonds. De plus, le demandeur n'a pas établi de lien entre ses frais de subsistance et le produit de la vente de la pizzéria et ses revenus.
[13]
Le 21 octobre 2011, l'arbitre a établi un [traduction] « Résumé de l'affaire et motifs de la décision ». Dans ce document, il a présenté la preuve et les diverses observations et recommandé que le ministre décide, conformément au paragraphe 27(1) de la Loi, que le demandeur avait contrevenu au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi en omettant de déclarer les espèces importées et qu'il confirme la confiscation des espèces en application de l'alinéa 29(1)
c)
.
[14]
La directrice, Division des appels, Direction des recours, ASFC, qui agit en qualité de déléguée du ministre (la directrice), a accepté les recommandations. Dans une lettre datée du 7 décembre 2011, elle a informé le demandeur de la décision du ministre (la décision). Dans le cadre du présent contrôle judiciaire, le demandeur cherche à obtenir une ordonnance qui annule la décision et renvoie l'affaire pour qu'une nouvelle décision soit rendue.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[15]
Selon la décision, la directrice, qui agissait en qualité de déléguée du ministre, a décidé conformément à l'article 27 de la Loi qu'il y avait eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi relativement aux espèces saisies et que ces espèces devaient être confisquées en vertu de l'article 29 de la Loi.
[16]
Les motifs de la décision reprennent les raisons pour lesquelles l'agente de l'ASFC, soupçonnant qu'il s'agissait de produits de la criminalité, a saisi les espèces, comme elle l'a indiqué dans le rapport descriptif. Voici les raisons données:
• Le demandeur et sa sœur ont quitté le Sri Lanka comme réfugiés à l'époque où les Tigres tamouls fuyaient aussi le Sri Lanka.
• Le demandeur a quitté l'Allemagne pour se rendre au Canada après être allé au Sri Lanka un mois plus tôt.
• Il n'a pas pu expliquer comment il avait pu acheter des billets d'avion pour se rendre à la fois au Sri Lanka et au Canada.
• Il a donné des versions contradictoires quant à l'objet de son voyage et il n'avait que peu de détails à fournir au sujet de sa visite.
• Il a fourni des versions contradictoires au sujet de la personne qui l'attendait à l'aéroport.
• Il a répondu de façon évasive et est devenu nerveux lorsqu'il a été interrogé au sujet des Tigres tamouls.
• Les espèces saisies n'étaient pas emballées et les billets n'étaient pas tous placés de la même façon, ce qui indiquait qu'ils n'avaient pas été obtenus d'une banque.
• Les espèces n'avaient pas été déclarées aux douanes allemandes.
• Il y avait des contradictions dans sa version concernant ses déplacements, son emploi et la source des fonds.
• Il avait de la difficulté à expliquer de quelle façon les espèces étaient entrées en sa possession et il n'avait pas de documents qui démontraient leur origine.
• Son habitude de traiter au comptant et d'avoir recours à de nombreuses banques donne à penser qu'il cherchait à se soustraire aux exigences des banques en matière de déclaration.
• Il a fait des déclarations contradictoires quant aux raisons pour lesquelles il allait remettre cet argent à sa sœur.
• Il n'a pas été en mesure de fournir de renseignements sur sa situation financière personnelle.
• Il ne savait pas combien d'argent il avait en sa possession et il n'a pas semblé préoccupé par la saisie des sommes en question.
[17]
Les motifs de la décision décrivent ensuite les observations du demandeur visant à justifier la demande d'appel puis répondent à chacune de ces observations. En ce qui concerne l'assertion selon laquelle il ne comprenait pas suffisamment bien l'anglais pour bien saisir les exigences énoncées dans la formule de déclaration, la directrice souligne que l'agente de l'ASFC avait précisément mentionné dans son rapport qu'il n'y avait pas de problème de langue. L'agente de l'ASFC avait demandé au demandeur s'il comprenait bien tout ce qui figurait sur la carte de déclaration du voyageur (CDV) et ce dernier aurait répondu que oui et qu'il savait de quelle façon faire la déclaration. De plus, la directrice a ajouté que si le demandeur n'avait pas compris les questions sur la CDV ou les questions posées par l'agente de l'ASFC, il lui revenait d'attirer l'attention de l'agente de l'ASFC à cet égard, de sorte que l'aide nécessaire puisse lui être accordée. La directrice a conclu que la question de la langue n'expliquait pas le défaut du demandeur de déclarer les espèces qu'il avait en sa possession.
[18]
En ce qui concerne les fonds saisis, même si le demandeur a déclaré qu'ils étaient constitués du produit de la vente de sa pizzéria et d'autres bénéfices tirés de son entreprise, la directrice n'était pas convaincue que la preuve soumise par le demandeur établissait l'origine légitime des espèces. En effet, selon le contrat de vente, la pizzéria avait été vendue contre 10 000 € le 1er février 2010. Cependant, ces fonds étaient inférieurs à la somme saisie, même combinés au retrait personnel de 2 000 € du compte, confirmé par un bordereau. Aucune preuve documentaire n'établissait de lien entre le produit de la vente et les fonds saisis.
[19]
Selon la déclaration de revenus de l'entreprise du demandeur pour 2008, les activités de cette dernière avaient dégagé des recettes de 200 171 €. La directrice a souligné que ces revenus avaient été reçus deux ans avant la date de la saisie et qu'aucune preuve documentaire ne liait le produit des activités de l'entreprise aux fonds saisis. De la même façon, le bordereau de retrait de 2 000 € ne contenait pas de renseignements sur l'origine de ces fonds. De plus, aucun document n'avait été remis pour faire état des frais de subsistance du demandeur. Par conséquent, la directrice a été incapable d'établir la proportion des fonds saisis provenant de l'origine légitime alléguée après la prise en compte des frais de subsistance du demandeur. Pour cette raison, le ministre a refusé d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour restituer les fonds confisqués.
Questions en litige
[20]
Le demandeur soutient qu'il y a eu manquement à l'obligation d'équité procédurale étant donné qu'il n'a pas eu droit aux services d'un interprète au point d'entrée, même s'il l'avait demandé, et que le ministre n'a pas exercé raisonnablement le pouvoir que lui confère l'article 29 en matière de confiscation.
[21]
Je reformulerais les questions en litige comme suit:
a. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
b. Y a-t-il eu manquement à l'obligation d'équité procédurale?
c. La déléguée du ministre a-t-elle commis une erreur en estimant que les fonds devaient être confisqués?
Position des parties
Le demandeu
r
[22]
Le demandeur soutient qu'il parle l'anglais avec difficulté et qu'il a demandé à plusieurs reprises l'aide d'un interprète connaissant l'allemand lorsqu'il était interrogé par l'agente de l'ASFC au point d'entrée. Étant donné qu'il n'a pas eu accès à un interprète au moment où il l'a demandé, que sa maîtrise de l'anglais était insuffisante pour lui permettre de répondre efficacement aux questions qui lui étaient posées par l'agente de l'ASFC et que des inférences négatives ont été tirées des présumées contradictions dans ses réponses, il y a eu un manquement à l'équité procédurale qui a entraîné une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[23]
Le demandeur ajoute que le pouvoir discrétionnaire accordé au ministre à l'article 29 de la Loi n'a pas été exercé de façon raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 1267, le ministre disposait uniquement comme éléments de preuve d'affidavits dont il était impossible de vérifier la validité. Par contre, en l'espèce, le demandeur a fourni des documents vérifiables, y compris le contrat de vente de la pizzéria contre 10 000 €, un bordereau bancaire faisant état d'un retrait de 2 000 € et une déclaration de revenus d'entreprise indiquant des recettes de 200 171 €.
[24]
Selon le demandeur, le ministre exigeait de lui l'impossible en insistant pour obtenir des éléments de preuve documentaires rattachant le produit de la vente de la pizzéria aux fonds saisis; par conséquent, il se comportait de façon déraisonnable. Étant donné qu'il s'agissait d'une vente au comptant, il n'existe aucune preuve documentaire directe et le demandeur a fourni des documents corroborants suffisants qui étaient raisonnables dans les circonstances.
[25]
Le demandeur souligne que seule la provenance d'un montant de 3 530 € n'est pas expliquée après la prise en compte du produit de la vente de la pizzéria et du retrait bancaire, soit simplement 2,5 p. 100 des recettes de l'entreprise du demandeur en 2008. De plus, il est raisonnable de supposer que les 2 000 € provenant du compte personnel et la somme de 3 530 € étaient tirés du produit des activités de son entreprise. Se fondant sur les documents qu'il a soumis, le demandeur soutient qu'il n'était pas raisonnable que le ministre conclue qu'il n'était pas convaincu que les fonds saisis ne constituaient pas des produits de la criminalité.
[26]
Le demandeur fait également valoir que les insinuations non étayées sur ses liens avec les Tigres tamouls minent la décision. Les observations et conclusions du ministre qui font état d'un lien entre le demandeur et les Tigres tamouls sont déraisonnables.
Le défendeur
[27]
Le défendeur souligne avec insistance qu'il y a eu de toute évidence défaut de déclarer les espèces en cause et, par conséquent, contravention à l'article 12 de la Loi. Toute contestation de cette conclusion doit se faire au moyen d'un appel en vertu de l'article 27 de la Loi. Le présent contrôle judiciaire a simplement pour objet la décision du ministre de confisquer les devises saisies en vertu de l'article 29.
[28]
Le défendeur soutient que le demandeur n'a ni demandé les services d'un interprète ni eu besoin de ces services lorsqu'il était interrogé par l'agente de l'ASFC au point d'entrée. Selon le dossier, le demandeur a déclaré à l'agente de l'ASFC qu'il comprenait la déclaration et qu'il avait signé la CDV lui-même; de plus, dans ses observations ultérieures, il n'a pas nié avoir effectué lesdites déclarations. Selon les notes de l'agente, le demandeur [traduction] « avait une bonne maîtrise de l'anglais et n'avait pas de difficulté à comprendre les questions ». Cette affirmation est confirmée par le rapport descriptif qui fait état d'une longue conversation avec le demandeur au cours de laquelle ce dernier a été en mesure de s'exprimer de façon claire et détaillée en réponse aux questions qui lui étaient posées.
[29]
Selon le défendeur, au cours de ses premières communications avec l'ASFC, datées du 18 août 2010, le demandeur a déclaré avoir une connaissance limitée de l'anglais, mais il n'a pas mentionné un refus à une demande de services d'interprétation. Cette allégation a été formulée uniquement après que le défendeur eut indiqué dans une lettre datée du 29 octobre 2010 que le demandeur comprenait les questions qui lui étaient posées et qu'il aurait dû demander de l'aide s'il en avait eu besoin. Même si les services d'un interprète avaient été fournis, l'issue de l'examen aurait été la même étant donné l'itinéraire, les antécédents sociaux, les fausses déclarations et le comportement du demandeur.
[30]
Le défendeur nie qu'on ait présumé l'existence de liens entre le demandeur et les Tigres tamouls. Il soutient que, selon le dossier, le demandeur a nié avoir des liens personnels avec les Tigres tamouls et a été interrogé sur la question de savoir si les membres de sa famille les appuyaient, même s'il ne le faisait pas, lui. Sa réaction aux questions sur ce sujet aurait été la même en présence d'un interprète.
[31]
Le défendeur soutient que la décision était raisonnable parce que les trois documents qui avaient été soumis n'établissaient pas la légitimité de la source des fonds saisis. Les fonds provenant de la vente de l'entreprise un an plus tôt ne peuvent être rattachés aux espèces saisies uniquement par le contrat de vente. Aucun document n'établissait de lien entre le revenu gagné en 2008 et les espèces saisies. Le bordereau de retrait visait un montant inférieur à la différence entre la somme saisie et le produit de la vente de la pizzéria et aucun document ne confirmait la légitimité de l'origine des fonds retirés de la banque. Or, il incombe au demandeur de convaincre le ministre que les fonds ne constituent pas des produits de la criminalité (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 813). Le demandeur aurait pu le faire en fournissant des documents courants suffisamment crédibles ou convaincants permettant de rattacher les espèces à une source légitime, comme des documents bancaires faisant état du solde d'un compte, des déclarations d'exportation des douanes allemandes ou des papiers de la banque, mais il a décidé de ne pas le faire. Par conséquent, la décision du ministre était raisonnable.
Norme de contrôle
[32]
Lorsque la jurisprudence a défini la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière portée devant la cour, celle-ci peut l'adopter (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 57).
[33]
Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour d'appel a précisé que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique aux décisions du ministre est celle de la décision raisonnable (au paragraphe 25). Cette approche a été adoptée par la Cour dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 29.
[34]
Lorsqu'elle contrôle la décision du ministre selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la décision n'est pas transparente, justifiable et intelligible et n'appartient pas aux issues acceptables au vu des éléments de preuve soumis (voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47). Il ne revient pas à une cour de révision de substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable et il ne lui appartient pas non plus d'apprécier à nouveau la preuve (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 59).
[35]
Il est bien établi qu'en ce qui concerne l'équité procédurale, aucune déférence n'est de mise à l'égard du tribunal administratif (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 43).
Y a-t-il eu manquement à l'équité procédurale?
[36]
Même si aucune déférence n'est de mise à l'égard des tribunaux administratifs quant au contenu de l'obligation d'équité, l'allégation de manquement à l'équité procédurale en l'espèce est une question de fait: le demandeur avait-il besoin ou non d'un interprète? Le défendeur nie que les services d'un interprète aient été demandés. Il semble admettre que si le demandeur avait réellement demandé les services d'un interprète et que ces derniers lui avaient été refusés, il y aurait alors eu manquement à l'équité procédurale. La Cour n'a donc pas à se prononcer sur le contenu précis de l'obligation d'équité en l'espèce.
[37]
Étant donné que le différend porte uniquement sur une question de fait, la Cour doit faire preuve de déférence à l'égard du décideur à qui le Parlement a confié cette tâche, en l'espèce la directrice d'un des services de l'ASFC en tant que déléguée du ministre (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 46). Même si une conclusion de fait est pertinente dans le contexte d'un différend relatif à l'équité procédurale, la Cour ne se transforme pas en juge des faits lorsqu'elle procède au contrôle d'une décision d'un tribunal administratif qui a déjà examiné la question en litige.
[38]
En l'espèce, la directrice a conclu que le facteur langue n'a pas joué un rôle dans le défaut de déclarer les espèces, c'est-à-dire la contravention au paragraphe 12(1), qui a eu lieu selon ce qu'elle a décidé en application de l'article 27. La directrice a déclaré dans ses motifs que si le demandeur n'avait pas compris les questions figurant sur la CDV ou posées par l'agente de l'ASFC au point d'entrée, il lui incombait de le faire savoir à l'agente de l'ASFC, à ce moment-là, afin que l'aide requise lui soit apportée. La conclusion de fait de la directrice est donc que le demandeur n'a pas demandé les services d'un interprète.
[39]
Pour parvenir à ces conclusions, la directrice s'est appuyée sur le rapport descriptif de l'agente de l'ASFC. Il s'agit d'un rapport détaillé de sept pages établi le jour où le demandeur est entré au Canada. En voici un extrait:
[traduction]
Lorsqu'il s'est présenté à mon comptoir, j'ai demandé à M. SATHEESAN si le sac et les effets qu'il transportait étaient les siens, s'il avait rempli lui-même le sac et s'il en connaissait le contenu. M. SATHEESAN a répondu par l'affirmative à ces trois questions. J'ai demandé à M. SATHEESAN si le sac contenait des objets pointus ou dangereux et il a répondu par la négative. J'ai demandé à M. SATHEESAN s'il avait quitté l'Allemagne avec son sac, et M. SATHEESAN a répondu par l'affirmative. J'ai demandé à M. SATHEESAN si la carte E311 que j'avais dans la main était sa carte de déclaration, et il a répondu par l'affirmative. Je lui ai demandé s'il avait compris tout ce qui se trouvait sur la carte. M. SATHEESAN a répondu qu'il avait tout compris et qu'il savait de quelle façon faire une déclaration dans les formes. Le processus d'examen a été expliqué à M. SATHEESAN. M. SATHEESAN n'avait pas de questions à poser.
M. SATHEESAN avait une bonne maîtrise de la langue anglaise et n'avait pas de difficulté à m'entendre et à comprendre ce qui était dit et à répondre aux questions en anglais.
[40]
Dans les six pages suivantes, le rapport descriptif relate l'interrogatoire du demandeur qui a suivi et ses réponses aux nombreuses questions qui lui étaient posées.
[41]
Le demandeur soutient qu'il a demandé à la fois de l'eau et les services d'un interprète. Le rapport descriptif confirme que le demandeur a demandé un verre d'eau. L'agente de l'ASFC a indiqué dans son rapport avoir dit au demandeur qu'elle irait lui chercher de l'eau, mais qu'il devait absolument répondre aux questions. Elle a ensuite posé sa question de nouveau. Il n'est pas précisé si elle a fourni le verre d'eau qui était demandé. Il n'est pas question dans le rapport descriptif de la demande des services d'un interprète.
[42]
Dans son avis d'opposition daté du 18 août 2010, le demandeur a déclaré qu'il ne connaissait pas suffisamment bien l'anglais pour bien comprendre la formule de déclaration et qu'il n'était pas certain du montant d'argent qu'il était autorisé à importer sans avoir à le déclarer. Dans sa lettre du 22 novembre 2010, le demandeur a affirmé pour la première fois qu'il avait demandé les services d'un interprète, mais que cette demande avait été rejetée par l'agente de l'ASFC au motif qu'il maîtrisait suffisamment bien l'anglais.
[43]
La directrice n'a pas accepté l'allégation du demandeur selon laquelle il avait demandé les services d'un interprète et que ces services lui avaient été refusés. Elle lui a préféré le témoignage de l'agente de l'ASFC et, s'appuyant sur ce témoignage, elle a conclu que le facteur langue n'avait pas joué un rôle dans le défaut du demandeur de déclarer l'importation des espèces saisies. Elle a aussi considéré comme établi le fait que le demandeur avait une bonne maîtrise de l'anglais et qu'il n'avait pas de difficulté à entendre l'agente et à comprendre les questions qui lui étaient posées en anglais et à y répondre, comme il a été déclaré dans le rapport descriptif.
[44]
Comme il en a été question précédemment, la directrice a droit une grande déférence de la part d'une cour de révision sur les questions de fait (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 46). Je ne vois pas de raison de modifier sa conclusion implicite selon laquelle les services d'un interprète n'avaient pas été demandés étant donné que cette conclusion est transparente, justifiable et intelligible et qu'elle appartient à l'éventail des issues possibles acceptables compte tenu de la preuve au dossier dont elle disposait.
[45]
Comme il n'a pas réussi à réfuter cette conclusion de fait, le demandeur n'est pas fondé à soutenir qu'il y a eu un manquement à l'équité procédurale assimilable à une erreur susceptible de révision.
La déléguée du ministre a-t-elle commis une erreur en estimant que les fonds devaient être confisqués?
[46]
Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, des fonds avaient été saisis et confisqués parce que M. Sellathurai ne les avait pas déclarés à une agente des douanes en vertu de l'article 12 de la Loi. Il a été reconnu qu'au moment de la saisie, il existait des motifs raisonnables de soupçonner que les fonds étaient des produits de la criminalité ou étaient utilisés pour financer des activités terroristes. Il s'agissait pour la Cour d'appel fédérale d'établir si le ministre avait exercé correctement son pouvoir discrétionnaire en refusant de restituer les fonds en question à M. Sellathurai.
[47]
La Cour d'appel a ensuite décrit ce qui est en cause dans le cadre du contrôle judiciaire d'une décision du ministre rendue en vertu de l'article 29:
[49] Lorsque le ministre réclame de façon répétée une preuve de la légitimité de la provenance des espèces saisies, comme il l'a fait en l'espèce, on est en droit de conclure qu'il s'est fondé sur les éléments de preuve fournis à cet égard par le demandeur pour prendre sa décision. La logique sous-jacente est inattaquable. Si l'on peut démontrer la légitimité de leur provenance, les espèces ne peuvent être considérées comme des produits de la criminalité.
[50] Si, en revanche, le ministre n'est pas convaincu de la légitimité de la provenance des espèces saisies, il ne s'ensuit pas que les fonds sont des produits de la criminalité, mais simplement que le ministre n'est pas convaincu qu'il ne s'agit pas de produits de la criminalité. La distinction est importante parce qu'elle porte directement sur la nature de la décision que le ministre est appelé à prendre en vertu de l'article 29 qui, comme nous l'avons déjà signalé, vise une demande d'annulation de la confiscation. La question à trancher n'est pas celle de savoir si le ministre peut démontrer qu'il existe des motifs raisonnables de soupçonner que les fonds saisis sont des produits de la criminalité, mais uniquement celle de savoir si le demandeur est en mesure de convaincre le ministre d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour annuler la confiscation en lui démontrant que les fonds saisis ne sont pas des produits de la criminalité. Sans exclure la possibilité de convaincre par d'autres moyens le ministre à cet égard, la démarche qui s'impose consiste à démontrer la légitimité de la provenance des fonds. C'est bien ce que le ministre a réclamé en l'espèce et, vu l'incapacité de M. Sellathurai de lui faire cette démonstration, le ministre avait le droit de refuser d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour annuler la confiscation.
[48]
La Cour d'appel a aussi indiqué que le contrôle des décisions prises en vertu de l'article 29 ne doit pas être effectué selon une norme autre que celle de la décision raisonnable:
[51] On en arrive à la question qui a été débattue à fond devant nous. À quelle norme de preuve le demandeur doit-il satisfaire pour convaincre le ministre que les fonds saisis ne sont pas des produits de la criminalité? À mon avis, pour y répondre, il faut d'abord répondre à la question de la norme de contrôle. La norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la décision du ministre prévue à l'article 29 est celle de la décision raisonnable. Il s'ensuit que, si la conclusion du ministre au sujet de la légitimité de la provenance des fonds est, vu l'ensemble de la preuve dont il disposait, raisonnable, sa décision n'est pas susceptible de contrôle judiciaire. Dans le même ordre d'idées, si la conclusion du ministre n'est pas raisonnable, sa décision est susceptible de contrôle et la Cour doit intervenir. Il n'est ni nécessaire ni utile de tenter de définir à l'avance la nature et le type de preuve que le demandeur doit soumettre au ministre.
[49]
En l'espèce, le ministre a suivi l'approche décrite dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, en demandant à plusieurs reprises au demandeur de lui fournir une preuve documentaire démontrant la source légitime des fonds saisis. Par conséquent, il s'agit en l'espèce d'établir s'il était raisonnable que le ministre conclue, selon la preuve dont il disposait, qu'il n'était pas convaincu de la légitimité de la source des fonds.
[50]
Alors que dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, les seuls éléments de preuve soumis étaient constitués d'affidavits dont la validité ne pouvait être vérifiée, j'estime qu'en l'espèce il était aussi raisonnable que le ministre conclue que les documents présentés par le demandeur ne permettaient pas d'établir la légitimité des fonds. Les seuls fonds à l'égard desquels une source directe et potentiellement légitime a été mentionnée étaient ceux qui provenaient de la vente de la pizzéria. Cependant, rien ne prouve que les vingt billets de 500 € saisis constituaient vraiment le produit de la vente de cette entreprise: rien ne rattache ces espèces à ladite opération de vente. De plus, vu l'absence d'autres documents financiers faisant état des dépenses du demandeur au cours des deux années qui se sont écoulées depuis, il était raisonnable que le ministre refuse de supposer que la totalité de la somme de 10 000 € avait été conservée dans son intégralité, comme l'a soutenu le demandeur.
[51]
Le ministre a aussi demandé à plusieurs reprises des documents susceptibles d'établir une source légitime pour la somme de 2 000 € que le demandeur a retirée de son compte de banque. Le retrait bancaire ne révèle pas la source initiale de la somme de 2 000 €, à savoir si cette somme provenait des recettes d'exploitation de la pizzéria en 2008 ou d'une autre source. Les relevés de la même banque auraient probablement permis d'établir cette source et le demandeur aurait pu fournir lesdits relevés. Le demandeur a aussi refusé de produire tout document qui aurait pu démontrer que les bénéfices tirés de son entreprise lui ont permis de subsister depuis 2008 et qu'ils étaient la source légitime de la somme de 2 000 € qu'il a retirée de son compte personnel.
[52]
En ce qui concerne les dossiers fiscaux, ils démontrent que l'entreprise réalisait des bénéfices, mais ils ne révélaient pas de quelle façon l'argent saisi a un lien avec ces revenus. En résumé, le demandeur n'a pas réussi à établir l'existence d'un lien entre les fonds saisis et une source légitime de cet argent.
[53]
Je suis aussi incapable d'accepter l'argument du demandeur selon lequel le ministre a exigé l'impossible et que, par conséquent, la décision est déraisonnable. Il incombe au demandeur de convaincre le ministre d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour annuler la confiscation en lui démontrant que les fonds saisis ne sont pas des produits de la criminalité. Le demandeur a soutenu que le ministre avait exigé l'impossible parce que, dans le cas de la vente au comptant, seul un document montrant les numéros de série consécutifs des billets de 500 € saisis, établi au moment où ils ont été reçus comme paiement de la pizzéria, suffirait à rattacher les espèces à une source légitime. À première vue, cet argument semble avoir un certain poids. Cependant, dans le contexte des documents très sommaires que le demandeur était prêt à fournir en réponse aux demandes répétées du ministre, comparativement aux dossiers qui devraient normalement et, par conséquent, raisonnablement se retrouver dans le contexte d'opérations financières commerciales et personnelles, et compte tenu des objets de la Loi décrits à l'article 3 (voir aussi la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 35), je ne pense pas que la demande du ministre était déraisonnable.
[54]
Étant donné que le demandeur n'a pas fourni une preuve suffisante pour convaincre le ministre que les fonds saisis ne constituaient pas des produits de la criminalité, le ministre a refusé de façon raisonnable d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour annuler la confiscation en vertu de l'article 29. Sa décision ne doit pas faire l'objet d'un contrôle.
[55]
Le demandeur soutient aussi que la décision était minée par les « insinuations » qui établissent un lien entre le demandeur et les Tigres tamouls et que les observations et conclusions du ministre à cet égard sont déraisonnables. Certains des commentaires consignés au dossier concernant l'origine ethnique tamoule du demandeur, pris isolément, me font réfléchir. Par exemple, c'est un procédé douteux que de juger suspect le fait que le demandeur a quitté le Sri Lanka en même temps que des membres des Tigres tamouls étant donné que le demandeur était un enfant à l'époque et que la guerre civile qui faisait rage dans ce pays avait poussé de nombreux citoyens à fuir. De la même façon, soupçonner le demandeur d'activités illégales du fait qu'il se rendait dans un quartier de Scarborough [traduction] « connu pour son appui aux Tigres tamouls » peut être assimilé à un stéréotype. Il semble aussi raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'une personne interrogée dans un aéroport relativement au problème du terrorisme réagisse avec nervosité.
[56]
En l'espèce, cependant, ces éléments ne sont pas pertinents parce que seule la décision du ministre rendue en vertu de l'article 29 est en cause. Le fait que le demandeur a omis de déclarer l'importation de fonds supérieurs à 10 000 $CAN n'est pas contesté. Cependant, comme les fonds ont alors été confisqués conformément au paragraphe 18(1) et n'ont pas été restitués parce que l'agente de l'ASFC avait des motifs raisonnables de soupçonner que les espèces étaient des produits de la criminalité au sens du paragraphe 18(2), la seule façon pour le demandeur de contester la confiscation en vertu de l'article 18 était de demander au ministre, en vertu de l'article 25, de décider s'il y avait eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1). Comme le ministre a répondu affirmativement à cette question, il peut, en vertu du paragraphe 29(1), exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour annuler la confiscation (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[57]
Comme il a été établi dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité:
[34] Le ministre n'est appelé à exercer le pouvoir discrétionnaire prévu à l'article 29 que lorsqu'il conclut, à la suite d'une demande présentée en vertu de l'article 25, qu'il y a effectivement eu contravention à l'article 12. En conséquence, le point de départ de l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire du ministre est le fait que les devises confisquées, qui se trouvent alors entre les mains du ministre des Travaux publics conformément à l'article 22, sont, à toutes fins que de droits, la propriété de l'État. Voici à ce propos ce qu'on trouve dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aux pages 557 et 558:
[...]
[...]
[36] Selon moi, il s'ensuit que la conclusion de l'agent des douanes suivant laquelle il a des motifs raisonnables de soupçonner que les devises saisies sont des produits de la criminalité
devient caduque
dès que le ministre confirme qu'il y a eu contravention à l'article 12. La confiscation est complète et les devises sont la propriété de l'État. La seule question qu'il reste à trancher pour l'application de l'article 29 est celle de savoir si le ministre exercera son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour annuler la confiscation soit en restituant les espèces confisquées elles-mêmes soit en remboursant la pénalité prévue par la loi qui a été versée pour obtenir la restitution des espèces saisies. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[58]
Par conséquent, ces facteurs ne sont pas pertinents. Ils n'ont joué aucun rôle dans l'évaluation de la légitimité des fonds en vertu de l'article 29. Dans la décision, la mention des Tigres tamouls ne fait que justifier en partie la saisie initiale. La portion de la décision qui traite de l'article 29 concerne la preuve documentaire fournie par le demandeur dans une tentative d'établir l'origine légitime des espèces saisies, de la façon décrite précédemment. Quoi qu'il en soit, dans ses observations, le défendeur a déclaré qu'il n'y avait eu aucune inférence quant à l'existence d'un lien entre le demandeur et les Tigres tamouls.
[59]
Étant donné que le ministre n'a pas été saisi de la question d'un remboursement partiel des fonds, la Cour ne peut examiner pour la première fois cette question dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire.
[60]
La décision du ministre était transparente, intelligible et justifiée et elle appartenait aux issues acceptables. La demande devrait donc être rejetée.
