ASSESSMENT OF COSTS - REASONS
[1]
Preston, Assessment Officer
: By way of Reasons for Order and Order dated January 20, 2010, the Court dismissed the Application for Judicial Review. Further, by way of an Order Respecting Oral Argument on Costs dated November 19, 2012, the Court awarded costs of the Application to the Respondents and specified that costs were to be assessed in accordance with Column III of Tariff B of the
Federal Courts Rules
.
[2]
On June 6, 2013, the Respondents filed their Revised Bill of Costs and on July 4, 2013, the Respondents filed a Further Bill of Costs which addresses the disbursements related to the assessment of costs. The assessment of costs was heard by way of teleconference on July 11, 2013.
[3]
At the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the Respondents submitted that the claims for photocopies for July 24, 2003, July 25, 2003 and April 5, 2004 were being removed from the Bill of Costs as they related to motions for which costs had previously been withdrawn. The Respondents also withdrew the claim for photocopies produced by the Federal Court on January 27, 2009.
[4]
Both parties have produced extensive submissions concerning the scale of cost to be used for assessable services. I will address this preliminary issue prior to proceeding with the assessment of assessable services and disbursements.
Scale of Costs
[5]
At paragraph 3 of the Respondents Submissions on Costs, counsel submits:
The respondents claim costs at the upper range of Column 3 of the tariff because the hearing of the applicants' judicial review application, including the hearing of a number of motions, which were directed to be heard and determined at the hearing of the application for judicial review (the "Application"), was inordinately lengthy and complex. This was not a "garden variety" judicial review.
Then, at paragraph 171, counsel submits that a consideration of the factors under Rule 400(3) of the
Federal Courts Rules
supports an award of costs in the highest range of column III of the table in Tariff B.
[6]
In response, at paragraph 7 of the Applicants' Memorandum on the Quantum of Costs (Applicants' Memorandum), counsel argues:
It was open to Justice Campbell, on hearing the exact arguments made here, to award costs at the highest range of Column 3. Justice Campbell did not do so. In light of this, and despite the same arguments by the Respondents here, the Applicants submit that the default position for any specific Tariff Item is the mid-point of Column 3, unless there are reasons to vary from the mid-point. To accede to the Respondents' argument, and award allowable costs at the highest range of Column 3 for all Tariff Items, would in effect usurp Justice Campbell's specific response to the same arguments (he found "no reason to award costs other than as set out in Column 3 of Tariff B"). This would be akin to making a costs order which is not within the jurisdiction of an Assessment Officer.
In support of this, counsel for the Applicants referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[7]
At paragraph 6 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits:
While Justice Campbell awarded costs under Column III, he did not comment or make any direction with respect to the range within that Column, properly leaving that determination to the Assessment Officer. The Applicants' argument that the Respondents are not entitled to costs for any item at the top of Column III must fail for these reasons.
[8]
Rule 407 of the
Federal Courts Rules
states:
Unless the Court orders otherwise, party-and-party costs shall be assessed in accordance with column III of table to Tariff B.
I find nothing in the wording of Rule 407 which limits the assessment of the assessable services claimed to the mid-point of Column III.
[9]
In the final paragraph of the Order Respecting Oral Argument on Costs dated November 19, 2012 (the Costs Order), the Court ordered:
I find that, while the Applicants'
Charter
challenge was complex and required a significant amount of time and effort by both sides of the litigation as well as the Court, there is no reason to award costs other than as set out in Column 3 of Tariff B of the
Federal Courts Rules
, and I so order.
[10]
While I agree with counsel for the Applicants that the Order does not specify that the costs are to be allowed at the high end of Column III, I also agree with counsel for the Respondents that the Order does not limit any allowance of costs to the mid-point of Column III.
[11]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
), the Court referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in which the Court held: "According to Rule 407 of the Rules, these costs are
typically assessed at the mid-point of Column III of Tariff B
, along with certain additional fees and disbursements" (emphasis added). Although the Court held that costs are "typically assessed at the mid-point", I find that this does not limit me to allowing costs only at the mid-range of Column III as there may be circumstances when the costs claimed are not of a typical nature.
[12]
On that point, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Federal Court of Appeal held:
Acting pursuant to Rule 405, the assessment officer had no choice but to apply column III of the Tariff B table, as stipulated in Rule 407. In assessing and allowing the costs
within the limits set in Rule 407
and pursuant to the judgment rendered in case A-598-99 she could, under Rule 409,
consider in allocating the units allowed the factors referred to in Rule 400(3)
... (emphasis added).
In stating that an Assessment Officer may consider the factors in Rule 400(3) when allocating the units allowed within the limits of Rule 407, the Court is clearly suggesting that, absent a direction of the Court, an Assessment Officer has jurisdiction to determine the number of units to be allowed, within the range of Column III.
[13]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> it was held:
The structure of the Tariff embodies partial indemnity by a listing of discrete services of counsel in the course of litigation, not necessarily exhaustive. The Rules are designed to crystallize the pertinent issues and eliminate extraneous issues. For example, the pleading and discovery stages may involve a complex framing and synthesizing of issues leaving relatively straightforward issues for trial. Therefore, each item is assessable in its own circumstances and it is not necessary to use the same point throughout in the range for items as they occur in the litigation. If Items are a function of a number of hours, the same unit value need not be allowed for each hour particularly if the characteristics of the hearing vary throughout its duration. In this bill of costs, the lower end of the range for item 5 and the upper end of the range for item 6 are possible results. Some items with limited ranges, such as item 14, required general distinctions between an upper and lower assignment in the range for the service rendered.
[14]
Given that the Court has provided no specific direction concerning the range of Column III, I find that, as an Assessment Officer, I am able to determine the number of units to be allocated for each individual assessable service within the full range of Column III, recognizing that typically services are assessed around the mid-point except when circumstances dictate that a specific cost should be assessed at a level below or above the mid-point of Column III.
Assessable Services
[15]
Having reached the conclusion above, I will proceed with the assessment of the various Items claimed, taking into consideration the factors listed in Rule 400(3) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, as necessary.
[16]
Concerning Item 2, preparation and filing of all defences, replies, counterclaims or respondents' records and materials, counsel for the Respondents submits that 7 units is claimed for the preparation of the Respondents' Record filed October 6, 2009.
[17]
At paragraph 10 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits that the Applicants take no issue with Item 2 being allowed at the mid-point of Column III.
[18]
In preparing their Application Record, the Respondents were required to defend the case presented by the Applicants. I have reviewed the Respondents' Application Record, Affidavits and Memorandum of Fact and Law and when consideration is given to their preparation and the issues raised by the Applicants which the Respondents had to address, the Respondents' claim under Item 2 is completely reasonable. Therefore, Item 2 is allowed as claimed at 7 units.
[19]
The Respondents have submitted five claims at 7 units each under Item 5, preparation and filing of a contested motion, including materials and responses thereto. These include claims for the Respondents' Motion for an order striking John and Jane Doe from the Application (Motion Doc. No. 12), the Applicants' Motion to Admit (Motion Doc. No. 52), the Respondents' Motion for an order striking the whole or parts of Affidavits filed by the Applicants in support of their Application (Motion Doc. No. 83), the Applicants' Motion for an order striking various paragraphs from various affidavits filed by the Respondents (Motion Doc. No. 99) and, the Respondents' Submissions on Costs requested by the Court. I will address each of these motions individually.
[20]
Concerning the claim under Item 5 for Motion Doc. No. 12, commencing at paragraph 23 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel argues that on December 12, 2003, the Applicants filed a Discontinuance on behalf of the Applicant Jane Doe and, on March 19, 2004 the Applicants filed a Notice of Motion for an order for leave to file an Amended Notice of Application, abandoning their Judicial Review of the decisions listed in paragraph (b), (d) and (e) of the Notice of Application filed May 28, 2003. Then, at paragraph 34 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel submits:
In effect, the applicants conceded most of the AGC's 2003 strike motion by filing the Jane Doe discontinuance and by their first motion to amend that discontinued and abandoned the review of the purported decisions listed in (b), (d) and (e) of their Original Application. For these reasons, the AGC seeks costs of its 2003 strike motion pursuant to Rule 402 and 410 of the
Federal Courts Rules
.
In support of this contention, the Respondents refer to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[21]
Commencing at paragraph 11 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel contends that Rule 401 of the
Federal Courts Rules
permits the Court to award costs of a motion. Counsel continues by submitting that if no specific order for costs is made on a motion, no costs may be allowed. Then at paragraph 17, counsel argues that the Order of November 4, 2008, concerning Doc. No. 12, is silent as to costs. Concerning Rule 402 and Rule 410, commencing at paragraph 19 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel argues:
19. Rule 402 applies if there is a discontinuance or abandonment. The applicants did not discontinue the Application, nor did they abandon a motion. This Rule does not apply. In addition, when the Application was filed the Applicants believed that all the shipments listed as seized had been seized. Subsequent release of some shipments, and hence the reasonable amendment of the Application to drop them, does not lead to an entitlement to costs under Rule 402 A situation akin to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Respondents cases are not on point.
20. Rule 410 only applies to an amendment to a pleading "made without leave". As outlined by the Respondents, a motion to amend was brought and allowed by Justice Campbell with no costs ... Rule 410 does not apply because the amendment was made with the leave of the Court and without an order for costs.
[22]
At paragraph 22 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel refers to paragraphs 23 to 34 of their submissions filed June 7, 2013 and makes no further submissions.
[23]
I have reviewed Motion Doc. No. 12 and find that the Applicants' discontinuance and subsequent Motion to amend their Notice of Application did not completely dispose of the Motion. This is evidenced by the Order of November 4, 2008, which, I have confirmed, relates to the Respondents' Motion Doc. No. 12. As submitted by the Applicants, the Court's Order strikes John Doe from the style of cause and is silent as to costs. These being the circumstances, I find that the Respondents are not entitled to their costs of the Motion and that it is not necessary to address the Respondents' submissions concerning Rule 402 and Rule 410. Therefore, the costs claimed under Item 5 for the Motion Record filed September 2, 2003 are not allowed.
[24]
Concerning the Respondents' claim under Item 5 for Motion Doc. No. 52, the claim relates to the Respondents' Motion Record filed April 30, 2008, which contains one volume. Commencing at paragraph 40 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel argues that the Applicants applied to amend their Amended Application to add 45 new paragraphs. Counsel for the Respondents also submits that the Motion was set for hearing on May 9, 2008 and then adjourned to be heard November 13 and 14, 2008 in Calgary. Then, at paragraph 45 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel contends:
In addition, Campbell J. directed that the applicants 2008 Motion to Admit would be dealt with as part of the hearing of the judicial review application (i.e. that the admissibility of the 1-800 call notes, Jarvis' and Brosseau's testimony as well as the ITO from the prior criminal proceeding would be addressed at a
voir dire
at the hearing of the application).
In support of this, counsel refers to the Written Directions of the Court dated November 13, 2008. Then at paragraph 176 c. of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel contends that the Attorney General is seeking costs as the Motion was directed to be heard as part of the main Judicial Review and the Court's Reasons dismissed the Applicants Motion.
[25]
At paragraph 12 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits that if a motion is heard at a judicial review hearing and the order emanating from the judicial review is silent concerning the costs of the motion, there is no order of costs for the motion. In support of this, counsel refers to paragraphs 8 to 11 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Then at paragraph 25 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel contends:
Item B. 5 Motion Record filed April 30, 2008 (Court Doc. 58) in reply to Applicants' Motion (Court Doc. 52). The Respondents argue ... that they are seeking costs for this motion "as it was subsumed within and was directed to be heard as part of the main judicial review application and the Court reasons dismissed the applicants' Motion to Admit". The Respondents' assertion is incorrect, the motion was largely successful. Item 1 in the motion was largely granted at the May 9, 2008, hearing of the motion and an Amended Notice of Application was later filed. Items 2 and 3 were brought out of an abundance of caution and those affidavits were filed (the relief requested). Items 4 and 6 became moot only after the cross examination of Sandra Jarvis (similar testimony to the testimony referred to in Item 4 was given on cross, and the ITO in Item 6 was admitted as an exhibit to the cross of Ms. Jarvis). Item 6 was admitted into evidence by Justice Campbell. Item 3 only became unnecessary after the Respondents conceded they never took safety into consideration. Item 7 was granted at the hearing (the 1-800 crisis line notes were admitted). In any event, there was no costs order for this motion, and so the relative success of the motion is not relevant. Without a costs order there are no costs for motions.
[26]
At paragraph 25 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions on Costs, counsel disagrees with the Applicants' contention that the Applicants were "largely successful" in their Motion and refers to paragraph 77 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, which suggests:
With respect to the applicants' 2008 Motion to Admit, the Court found the contents of the "1-800 crisis line notes" irrelevant and refused to admit them for the truth of their contents. With respect to the "in court testimony of Mr. Miles Brosseau ...to prove that Health Canada did not consider the health consequences of the April 2003 seizure before making the seizure", the Court found their motion unnecessary given that the respondents did not contest this fact. In this regard, the Court dismissed the applicants' 2008 Motion to Admit.
[27]
Counsel for the Respondents has submitted that they are seeking costs as the Motion was directed to be heard as part of the main Judicial Review and the Motion was dismissed. In this situation, there must be an Order of the Court specifically awarding costs of the Motion before I am able to assess the costs of the Applicants' Motion to Admit (Motion Doc. No. 52). On this point, in keeping with the findings in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
), I find that the Court did not exercise its discretion to award costs of this Motion, or any other motion, in the Order Respecting Oral Argument on Costs dated November 19, 2012. On page 4 of the Order, the Court states: "As a result, I award
costs of the Application
to the Respondent" (emphasis added). The Court was very precise in awarding costs of the Application. By specifically mentioning the Application in the award of costs, I find that the Court was limiting the costs award to the costs of the Judicial Review Application and was clearly indicating that no costs were being awarded for the motions heard at the Judicial Review hearing. Therefore, the Respondents' claim under Item 5 for Motion Doc. No. 52 is not allowed.
[28]
The Respondents have claimed 7 units for Motion Records filed September 8, 2009 and October 6, 2009. These Motion Records are related to the Respondents' and Applicants' Motions to Strike, Motions Doc. No. 83 and Motion Doc. No. 99 respectively. Pursuant to the Order of May 11, 2009, both of these motions were returnable November 2, 2009 to be heard at the commencement of the Judicial Review. Both parties made extensive submission concerning these motions at the hearing of the Assessment of Costs and in their Written Submissions. Essentially the Applicants submit that there was no order awarding costs of the motions and that the Court would have had to specifically award costs of the motions before they could be assessed. The Respondents argued that this was a complex Judicial Review Application in which the Court directed that the motions be heard at the Judicial Review hearing on November 2, 2009 and that the evidentiary motions became part of the Judicial Review. Counsel for the Respondents contended that the Court was contemplating the entirety of the hearing, including the motions when it awarded costs.
[29]
I do not find it necessary to delve extensively into the submissions of the parties concerning the Motions to Strike. Having reviewed the Reasons for Order and Order dated January 20, 2010, I find that, at paragraphs 75 through 85, the Court addresses the parties' Motions to Strike portions of the affidavit evidence filed. At paragraph 85 the Court concludes: "the evidence found to be irrelevant is inadmissible". There is no mention of an award of costs in the Court's disposition of the motions. Given this, my finding at paragraph 25, above, that the Courts award of costs is specific to the Application for Judicial Review, applies equally to these motions. Therefore, in keeping with my decision in paragraph 27, the Respondents' claim under Item 5 for their Motion Record filed September 8, 2009 and their claim under Item 5 for their Motion Record filed October 6, 2009 are not allowed.
[30]
The Respondents have claimed 7 units under Item 5 for the Motion Record filed September 17, 2012, for an order of costs in favour of the Respondents. At paragraph 94 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel contends that the Court "directed that the entitlement issue would be decided by way of a motion in writing". The Applicants only submission concerning this claim is that there is no order for costs made by the Court.
[31]
I have reviewed the Court Record and find that at the Case Management Conference (CMC) of May 22, 2012, the Court directed that the Attorney General of Canada was to forward its "application on the issue of costs via Memorandum of Argument by September 17, 2012". Although the Court uses the word application in the direction, there is nothing in the direction which indicated that the Respondents were to file a Motion Record. This must have been apparent to the Respondents as, on September 17, 2012, they filed a document titled "Respondents' Memorandum on Their Entitlement to Costs", not a Motion Record. Under these circumstances, I find that there is no entitlement to costs under Item 5 as there was no motion. In the alternative, if the Court intended the Respondents' application on the issue of costs to be considered a motion, the Order Respecting Oral Argument on Costs dated November 19, 2012 does not specifically award costs for any motion on costs. Therefore, the Respondents' claim under Item 5, relating to the Respondents' Memorandum on Their Entitlement to Costs, filed September 17, 2012, is not allowed.
[32]
The Respondents' have also submitted a claim under Item 15, preparation and filing of written argument, where requested or permitted by the Court, for the Respondents' Memorandum on Their Entitlement to Costs. At paragraph 188 of the Respondents' Costs Submissions, counsel argues that the submissions relate to the Respondents entitlement to costs and whether costs should be decided on the basis of a motion in writing.
[33]
In response, Applicants' counsel contends that Item 15 is under the heading "E. Trial or Hearing" and that it is not for the preparation for a motion. Counsel further submits that this is a duplicate claim as the Respondents have already submitted a claim under Item 5 and that there is no award of costs on the Motion, which would preclude an allowance of costs.
[34]
At paragraph 50 of the Respondents' Reply, counsel submits that the Court directed that the parties file submissions on the entitlement to costs and that in consideration of these materials, the Respondents' claim is proper and should be allowed.
[35]
The Respondents' claim under Item 5 for the preparation of their Costs Memorandum was disallowed at paragraph 31 above. As previously indicated, the Respondents' Costs Memorandum was filed on September 17, 2012, further to a Direction of the Court. It has been held that a prerequisite for Item 15 to be allowable is a prior direction of the Court requesting or permitting written submissions (see:
League for  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Having found that the Respondents' claim under Item 5 could not be allowed, I find the Respondents' claim under Item 15 to be proper as the Memorandum was filed further to the Court's Direction of May 22, 2012. Concerning the number of units allowable, I find the Respondents' claim of 7 units to be excessive. Given that the Memorandum concerned the party's entitlement to costs and not substantive issues before the Court, I find an allowance of 5 units reasonable. Therefore, Item 15 is allowed at 5 units.
[36]
The Respondents have claimed 10 units (3.33 Hours x 3 units) under Item 6 for their appearance on a motion held May 9, 2008. This hearing concerned the Applicants' Motion to admit (Motion Doc. No. 52). In keeping with my decisions at paragraph 27 above, I find that the Respondents are not entitled to any costs on this particular motion. Therefore, the Respondents' claim under Item 6 is not allowed.
[37]
The Respondents have submitted 17 claims under Item 8 and Item 9 respectively, for the preparation and cross-examinations on the affidavits of the various affiants on the Judicial Review. The Respondents have requested 5 units for each claim under Item 8 and 3 units per hour for each claim under Item 9.
[38]
The first four claims under each Item relate to the cross-examinations of Sandra Jarvis, Miles Brosseau, Rod Neske and Dennis Shelley, conducted in November and December 2003. At paragraph 24 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel submits that these affidavits were filed in support of their motion to strike (Motion Doc. No. 12). Then at paragraph 51, the Respondents submit that they gave notice that they were going to rely on 7 affidavits on the Judicial Review, including the affidavits of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske, mentioned above. At the hearing of the assessment, counsel for the Respondents submitted that the Applicants included the transcripts of the cross-examination of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske in their Application Record.
[39]
At paragraph 34 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel argue:
The first four preparations claimed ...all relate to examinations in 2003, connected to a motion brought by the Respondents .... Because costs were not ordered on this motion, these costs should not be allowed. It is not material that the Applicants filed one of these transcripts in the Judicial Review.
At the hearing of the assessment, counsel for the Applicants submitted that although portions of the transcripts of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske were relative to the Judicial Review and were included in the Applicants' Record, the cross-examination were conducted for the Respondents' Motion to strike.
[40]
Commencing at paragraph 28 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions on Costs, counsel argues:
i. The AGC submits that the examinations of Sandra Jarvis, Miles Brosseau, Rod Neske and Dennis Shelley were part of the Respondents' September 2003 Motion to Strike in respect of which costs are sought pursuant to Rules 402 and 410 of the FCR ....
ii. Alternatively, costs should be granted for the preparation on the cross-examination on the affidavit of Rod Neske in 2003 as the applicants filed that in their Record on the judicial review. The AGC submits that the applicants should not be allowed to use a transcript on an examination at the hearing of the judicial review to make out their case, but try to hide from the costs associated with it by claiming it was for a prior motion. Such a decision would allow the applicants to gain the benefit of using a transcript without the associated risk and cost.
At the hearing of the assessment, counsel for the Respondents argued that if the costs for the Motion to strike are denied, the cross-examination of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske should be allowed as part of the Judicial Review.
[41]
The parties are in agreement that these cross-examinations were part of the Respondents' Motion to Strike (Motion Doc. No. 12). At paragraph 29, above, I found that the Respondents are not entitled to their costs related to the Motion to Strike. In keeping with this decision, the claims under Item 8 and Item 9 for the cross-examinations of Miles Brosseau and Dennis Shelley are not allowed as they only relate to the motion. Concerning the cross-examinations of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske, the parties agree that the Respondents relied on the respective affidavits at the Judicial Review and that the transcripts of the 2003 cross-examinations were included in the Applicants' Record. Contrary to the Respondents' contention that the Applicants should not be able to avoid the costs by arguing that the cross-examinations were for a prior motion, I find that the claim under Item 8 for the cross-examinations of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske should not be allowed. The Respondents have presented no evidence of when they notified the Applicants of their intention to rely on the affidavits of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske at the Judicial Review. This being the circumstance, the Applicants would have had no reason to cross-examine the affiants on anything other than the motion. On that point, the Respondents have presented claims for subsequent cross-examinations of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske on August 3, 2009 and June 23, 2009 respectively and, at paragraphs 35 and 39 of the Applicants Memorandum, counsel submits that the Applicants do not take any issue with the second examinations as these examinations were to obtain evidence for the hearing of the judicial review, as opposed to the motion.
[42]
When viewed in hindsight, it appears that the Respondents should be entitled to Item 8 and Item 9 for the cross-examinations of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske held in 2003, because the Applicants included the transcripts in their Application Record. However, it has been decided that an assessment of costs may not be predicated on hindsight (see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Considering this, I find that the fact that the Respondents determined, at a later date, that it was necessary to include the transcript in their Record, is irrelevant. Further, when looked at from this perspective, it is not reasonable to expect the Applicants to reimburse the Respondents for a claim related to a motion for which no costs are allowed. Therefore, for the above reasons, the Respondents' claims under Item 8 and Item 9, relating to the cross-examinations of Sandra Jarvis and Rod Neske in 2003 are not allowed.
[43]
Concerning the remaining claims under Item 8 and Item 9, the next group consists of 11 claims relating to the cross-examinations of Dr. Kaplan, Dr. Popper, Anthony Stephan, David Hardy, Rod Neske, Dr. Vu, Dr. Mueller, Dr. Mithani, Dr. Robin Marles, Sandra Jarvis and Bruce Dale. At paragraph 35 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits that the Applicants consented to the eleven claims under Item 8, at the mid-point of Column III. Then at paragraph 39, the Applicants submit:
Adjusting for breaks ...the Applicants do not take any issue with the next eleven Item 9 claims ....The Applicants consent to these eleven Item 9 claims at one unit per hour. The three units per hour claimed by the Respondents would be excessive for this type of proceeding.
Counsel continues by submitting that lunch breaks and recesses in which counsel are not engaged working on the case are not recoverable under Item 9. In support of this, counsel refers to,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 37,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Then, on page 11 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel outlines that for the cross-examinations of Dr. Kapan, Dr. Popper, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Neske, Dr. Vu and Dr. Mueller, the number of hours claimed should be reduced to account for lunches each day.
[44]
The Respondents presented no rebuttal concerning Item 8. Having regard to Item 9, at the hearing of the assessment, counsel submitted that, for the attendance at the cross-examinations of the Respondents' affiants, there would have been a break for lunch. However, for the Applicants' affiants, counsel argued that they were full working lunches. Then at paragraph 32 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits:
...The Respondents' counsel examined 3 of the applicants' expert witnesses which involved very technical areas and included, in the Kaplan affidavits, a number of studies which required significant and ongoing preparation in order to conduct an effective cross-examination.
Having regard to the number of units claimed under Item 9, counsel for the Respondents argues that the Affidavits of Mr. Hardy and Mr. Stephan were voluminous, dense and contained many contentious issues. Then at paragraph 34 of their Reply Submissions, the Respondents contend:
For these reasons, the AGC respectfully submits that the applicants' suggestion that 3 units would be "excessive for this type of proceeding" is significantly off base. A review of the nature and content of those affidavits shows that this was a very complex matter.
[45]
Concerning Item 8, the Respondents have presented no evidence to justify a claim at the high end of Column III. However, despite the lack of evidence I find that the Respondents would have considerably more preparation for the cross-examination of the Applicants' affiants than for the Applicants' cross-examination of the Respondents' affiants. Under these circumstances and given the nature of the issues addressed in this proceeding, Item 8 is allowed at 4 units for the cross-examinations of Dr. Kaplan, Dr. Popper, Mr. Stephan, Mr. Hardy and Mr. Dales and is allowed at 3 units for the cross-examinations of Mr. Neske, Dr. Vu, Dr. Mueller, Dr. Mithani, Dr. Marles and Ms. Jarvis for a total of 38 units.
[46]
Concerning Item 9, having regard to lunch breaks, as the Respondents have conceded that there would have been a break for lunch during the cross-examinations of the Respondents, the amount of time claimed for Mr. Neske, Dr. Vu and Dr. Mueller will be reduced by one hour per day of cross-examination. Having regard to the Applicants' affiants, although the Respondents have submitted that these would have been full working lunches, I find that there would have been a period of time during each break when counsel would have been eating and performing other functions unrelated to this proceeding. Therefore, for the cross of Dr. Kaplan, Dr. Popper and Mr. Hardy, the amount of time claimed will be reduced by 30 minutes per day of cross-examination. As the cross-examinations of Mr. Stephan, Dr. Mithani, Dr. Marles, Ms. Jarvis and Mr. Dales did not extend over lunch, the amounts claimed have not been adjusted.
[47]
Concerning the number of units claimed per hour under Item 9, the Applicants have provided no explanation or evidence as to why 3 units per hour are excessive. On the other hand, the Respondents have provided no evidence or explanation why the cross-examinations of the Respondents' affiants should be allowed at the high end of Column III and only scant comments concerning the affidavits of Dr. Kaplan, Mr. Hardy and Mr. Stephan for the Applicants. Given these circumstances and the nature of the issues addressed in this proceeding, I will allow the claims for the cross-examinations of Dr. Kaplan, Dr. Popper, Mr. Stephan, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Neske, Dr. Vu, Dr. Mueller, Dr. Mithani, Dr. Marles, Ms. Jarvis and Mr. Dale at 2 units per hour for the number of hours as adjusted in paragraph 46 above. Therefore, Item 9 for the above mentioned individuals is allowed for a total of 108 units.
[48]
The next claims under Item 8 and Item 9 concern the cross examination of Dr. Silverstone. Having reviewed the material submitted by the parties, I find it necessary to consider all of the fees and disbursements related to Dr. Silverstone together. For this reason, I will consider the Respondents' claims under Item 8 and Item 9, concerning the cross examination of Dr. Silverstone, in conjunction with my consideration of the fees claimed for his services.
[49]
The final claims under Item 8 and Item 9 relate to the cross-examination of Ms. Kim Seeling. At paragraphs 37 and 43 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits that these claims should not be allowed as Ms. Seeling was called as a witness, at the direction of the Court, at the Judicial Review hearing on November 27, 2009. Counsel argues that these claims are duplicates to the Respondents' claims under Item 13(b) and Item 14(a) for preparation and attendance at the hearing.
[50]
At paragraph 30 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel argues that the attendance and cross-examination of Ms. Seeling on the last day of the Judicial Review hearing was directed by the Court. Counsel argues that this is not a duplicate claim as counsel was required to prepare the witness and arrange for the delivery of the seized materials.
[51]
I have reviewed the Court Record and confirmed that on November 27, 2009 Ms. Seeling was called as a witness at the judicial review hearing. This being the circumstance, any preparation and attendance relating to the witness are accounted for under Item 13(b) and Item 14(a). As the Respondents have submitted claims under Item 13(b) and Item 14(a), the examination of Ms. Seeling will be considered when assessing those costs. Therefore, the Respondents' claims under Item 8 and Item 9 for the cross-examination of Ms. Seeling are not allowed.
[52]
The Respondents have submitted 32 claims, at 6 units each, under Item 10 for preparation for Case Management Conferences (CMCs).
[53]
At paragraph 44 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits:
This case needs to clarify whether what we call Case Management Conferences ("CMCs") when a Judicial Review is specially managed under Rule 383, are meant to be Pre-Hearing Conferences under Rule 315 (which incorporate Rules 258 to 267). Item 10 simply uses the word "conference" under the heading "D. Pre-Trial and Pre-Hearing Procedures".
[54]
Then at paragraphs 46 and 47, the Applicants argue:
46.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at [10-11] ...,Items 10 and 11 were disallowed for a conference because the matter was a judicial review and Items 10 and 11 are under sub-paragraph D (Pre-Trial and Pre-Hearing Procedures) which rely on Rule 258 in an action. This decision does not mean that such procedures cannot apply to a judicial review in a Rule 315 order is made. It does stand for the proposition that not every non-motion "conference" is covered by Items 10 and 11.
47. Rule 258 conferences mandate specific preparation akin to a motion, and Item 10 permits units in amounts similar to contested motions. CMCs held in specially managed proceedings have none of the requirements under Rules 258-267 (unless specifically directed by the CMC Judge). In this case there were no Rule 315 orders to impose duties under Rules 258-267 for any of the 32 CMCs. As in this case, many CMCs in specially managed proceedings require no or little preparation and can be mere scheduling sessions.
[55]
And at paragraph 49, the Applicants submit:
There are cases where pre-hearings, even ones resulting in orders, have not been held to be Rule 315 pre-hearing conferences recoverable under Items 10 an 11 (see for example  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at [3] .... However, it is not clear where the dividing line, if any, is between Rule 315 pre-hearing conferences for which Items 10 and 11 clearly apply, and CMCs in specially managed proceedings in which no legal argument is made, no memorandums are filed, and most of which simply involve scheduling and reporting on progress to keep the file moving along.
[56]
The Applicants also submit that if all 32 CMCs are allowed, it could have the effect of deterring the use of CMCs in specially managed cases because the potential costs are prohibitive. Counsel further argues that the Respondents have provided no evidence that they actually spent time preparing for the CMCs and that there are 11 of the CMCs, listed in paragraph 52 of the Applicants' Memorandum which would be more properly classified as preparation for motions and are not recoverable without a costs order.
[57]
Commencing at paragraph 37 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits that the Applicants consented to having the Judicial Review case managed and that the Case Management Conferences were reasonable and necessary given the nature of the case and the issues involved, therefore, costs should be allowed. Then at paragraph 39 the Respondents submit:
The applicants cite one case for the connection to Rule 258 and the Tariff. However, that case does not restrict these items to
pre-trial
matters, Moreover, the Tariff heading is Pre-Trial and Pre-Hearing Procedures. In addition, this case does not refer to any authority that holds that Items 10 and 11 are not for judicial review. Rule 315 is clear that a Court may order that a conference be held in accordance with rule 258 to 267,
with such modifications as necessary
. (emphasis is the Respondents')
The Respondents continue by suggesting that there are a number of cases where fees under Items 10 and 11 have been allowed for CMCs in Judicial Reviews and that many of these CMCs dealt with scheduling matters. In support of this the Respondents refer to:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[58]
The Respondents also submit that if costs are not allowed for the CMCs, litigants would be able to utilize the Court's time without regard to the associated costs. Counsel further argues that the present case has a procedural history which spans over 10 years, that it is not surprising that there were 32 CMCs and that preparation by counsel was required for these CMCs since many of them went beyond mere scheduling.
[59]
Concerning Item 10, I will first address the issue of whether certain CMCs should be disallowed because they took on the nature of motions. Although the Respondents made no reply in response to this issue, I have reviewed the Court Record and find that all but three of the CMCs mentioned by the Applicants dealt with the scheduling of motions and the exchange of materials. In
Sam
(
supra
),
Métis National Council
(
supra
) and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
), it was held that Item 10 may be allowed for CMCs dealing with the scheduling of motions. Concerning the remaining CMCs raised by the Applicants, I have reviewed the Abstracts of the Hearing for the CMCs held April 2, 2008, November 3, 2008 and November 13, 2008 and find that the outcomes of the CMCs directly address motions for which no costs have been allowed. For example, in the Abstract of Hearing for the CMC held April 2, 2008, the result of the hearing indicates that Motion document 52 is adjourned to May 9, 2008 and "That it is agreed upon by the parties that paragraph 18 of the Affidavit of Janice Robinson located at Tab 5 of the Applicants Motion Record (DOC. 55 - Volume 1) (page 49), be blacked out with the words "By Order of Campbell J dated Aril 2, 2008" written in the margin". Also, it is clear from the Abstract of Hearing for November 3, 2008 that Motion document 52, considered earlier; was extensively discussed as being "largely vacated". Finally, the CMC of November 13, 2008 was held in conjunction with a motion for which no costs were allowed and there is no evidence to indicate whether the CMC dominated the 24 minutes the hearing lasted. Given these circumstances, I find that the CMCs on the above dates were so closely linked to motions that the Respondents claim under Item 10 cannot be allowed. It follows that the Respondents' claim under Item 11 will also not be allowed for these dates.
[60]
Concerning the remaining 29 CMCs, although I agree with the Applicants that this is a large number of CMCs for an individual proceeding, I can find no jurisprudence which limits the number of CMCs allowable. Further, given the obvious and agreed complexity of the matter and the duration of the proceeding, I find that one could expect that there would be a requirement for more than the usual number of CMCs. Further, the Respondents have provided several cases which stand for the allowance of claims under Item 10 for CMCs dedicated to scheduling matters.
[61]
Concerning the Applicants' contention that there is no evidence that the Respondents actually spent time preparing for the CMCs, in Reply, the Respondents suggested that many CMCs went beyond mere scheduling and required preparation by counsel. Moreover, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> it was held:
...The Seed Hawk Defendants advanced several claims for items 10 and 11 (preparation for and attendance on case conferences respectively). The Plaintiffs, in addition to their general argument above concerning proof and the counterclaim result,
argued that these conferences were brief and required little preparation and that the tariff did not contemplate a recovery for each and every one.
With respect to that argument, I think that the subheading "D. Pre-trial and Pre-Hearing Procedures" in the tariff is sufficiently broad to capture such services. As well,
I am reluctant to characterize a court-mandated appearance for the purpose of case management as so negligible in effect (these nine conferences ranged in duration from 10 to 35 minutes) that no meaningful work was required of counsel
. I allow these fee items as presented. (emphasis added)
[62]
In keeping with <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I find the very fact that the Court found it necessary to hold 32 CMCs is ample indication that the matters discussed were important and would have required meaningful work in preparation. On the other hand, as the Court Record indicates that scheduling of steps and the exchange of materials were the predominant issues at many of the CMCs; I find that an allowance of 3 units per event is reasonable for the remaining 29 CMCs claimed. Therefore Item 10 is allowed for a total of 87 units.
[63]
Concerning the remaining 29 claims under Item 11, the parties adopt their submissions under Item 10. Therefore, in keeping with my findings above, the remaining 29 claims under Item 11 are allowed at 1 unit per hour. I have reviewed the Court Record and find that the number of hours claimed are reasonable with the exception of the amount claimed for January 24, 2004. I allow this CMC for duration of 30 minutes, consistent with the duration recorded in the Abstract of Hearing. Taking this one adjustment into consideration, I find that Item 11 should be allowed for a total of 10.75 hours, resulting in a total allowance for all 29 CMCs of 10.75 units.
[64]
The Respondents have submitted two claims under Item 13(a) for preparation for motions heard September 18, 2003 and May 9, 2008. At paragraph 48 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits that these claims should be withdrawn if allowed under Item 5.
[65]
Even though the claims under Item 5 have not been allowed, it has been held that claims under Item 13(a) may not be allowed for motions (see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Therefore, the claims under Item 13(a) for the motions heard September 18, 2003 and May 9, 2008, are not allowed.
[66]
The Respondents have also submitted claims under Item 13(a), preparation for trial or hearing, and 13(b), preparation for trial or hearing per day in Court after the first day, for the Judicial Review hearing. Although the Applicants do not contest the Respondents' entitlement to the claims, they submit that the claims should be allowed at the mid-point of Column III to the Table in Tariff B. At paragraph 47 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits:
...Counsel for the Respondents can advise that the amount of time taken to prepare, continuously, for this case was excessive. Counsel for the Respondents prepared before the hearing, but were required to supplement their submissions every day and every weekend we had "off". Counsel for the AGC can advise as to hours spent preparing continuously during the hearing of this evolving matter as it unfolded each day in Court, working well into the morning hours almost every day of the hearing.
[67]
Concerning Item 13(a), I find that preparation prior to the hearing would not have involved the preparation of witnesses who were being called to testify as this was a Judicial Review. Further, although there were a number of affidavits filed by the Respondents, any time spent on these was allowed for under Item 2, Item 8 and Item 9. This being the circumstance, Item 13(a) is allowed at 3 units for preparation prior to the Judicial Review hearing.
[68]
Concerning Item 13(b), the Respondents have submitted that extensive preparation was required after each day in Court. Given the nature of this proceeding, I find that the number of units claimed by the Respondents is reasonable. Therefore, Item 13(b) is allowed for a total of 42 units.
[69]
Concerning the Respondents' claim under Item 14(a), first counsel per hour in Court, the Applicants, at paragraph 57 of their Memorandum, submit that they agree to first counsel time at the mid-point of Column III but, for the reasons outlined concerning Item 9, argue that the time for lunches and breaks should be removed. Counsel for the Applicants sets out the amount for time that should be removed from each day at the top pf page 16 of the Applicants' Memorandum.
[70]
At paragraph 49 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits that the complex and lengthy nature of this matter justifies their claim at the upper end of Item 14(a) and that the breaks are not an accurate reflection of the time spent in preparation to respond to the Applicants' arguments.
[71]
Concerning Item 14(a), it has been decided that nothing is allowable under item 14(a) for lunch breaks and that brief recesses, when counsel must remain in or close to the courtroom, are allowable (see: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
) at paragraph 205 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In keeping with these decisions, I will reduce the number of hours claimed to remove one hour from each day claimed to account for a lunch recess. I find any time beyond one hour is allowable as counsel would need to return to Court to organize their thoughts and settle for the resumption of the hearing. Concerning the number of units allowable, in keeping with my decision concerning Item 13(a), I allow 2 units per hour for the first 14 days as this was a Judicial Review Application which had no requirement for the examination or cross-examination of witnesses. For November 27, 2009, the final day of hearing, I allow 3 units per hour as this was the day Ms. Seeling was a witness (see paragraph 49 above). Therefore, for the above reasons, Item 14(a) is allowed for a total of 171 units.
[72]
The next assessable service claimed by the Respondents is Item 24, travel by counsel to attend a trial, hearing, motion, examination or analogous procedure, at the discretion of the Court. The Respondents have submitted three claims of 5 units each for travel to the Motion held May 9, 2008 and the Judicial Review hearing in Calgary, Alberta from November 2 to 20, 2009 and Vancouver, British Columbia on November 27, 2009. In response to the Respondents' claims, counsel for the Applicants submits that Item 24 is at the discretion of the Court and there is no order for travel costs for either the motion or the Judicial Review, therefore, the claim should not be allowed. In support of this, counsel referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[73]
In the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits:
The Applicants filed the Requisition for Hearing and chose Calgary as the location of the hearing. The Court directed the parties to attend the hearing in Calgary from November 2 - 20 and again  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  on November 27, 2009. As a result, travel by counsel to attend the hearing of the judicial review was "at the direction of the Court".
[74]
I note that Item 24 states: "at the discretion of the Court". I have reviewed the file and have confirmed that the Court did not exercise its discretion to award costs of travel by counsel. As was decided in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
) and
Carr
(
supra
), absent an order or direction of the Court, an Assessment Officer lacks the jurisdiction to allow the assessable services associated with travel. In keeping with these and many other decisions, I find that Item 24 may not be allowed as the Court has not awarded assessable services associated with travel. Therefore, the Respondents' claims under Item 24 are not allowed.
[75]
The Respondents have claimed 1 unit under Item 25 for services after judgment. As the Applicants do not contest this claim, it is allowed as presented in the Revised Bill of Costs.
[76]
The Respondents have claimed 6 units under Item 26 for the assessment of costs. At paragraph 60 of the Applicants Memorandum, counsel submits that Item 26 should be allowed at the mid-point as the submissions of the Respondents were largely the same as those presented before the Court when entitlement to costs was being argued. At paragraph 52 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel argues:
In respect of Item 26, the AGC submits that, given the voluminous materials filed to date by both parties, costs at the top end of Column III are amply justified. For this assessment, the AGC filed a Bill of Costs that spanned several years, an affidavit of disbursements comprised of 3 volumes and a 2 volume submission on June 7, 2013. To date the applicants have filed a 2 volume affidavit and a 4 volume response. The AGC's Reply should also be taken into account.
[77]
As has been indicated by the Respondents, this assessment of costs has generated several volumes of material from both parties. In addition to this, the Applicants cross-examined Tabitha Potts concerning the Affidavit of Disbursements. Under these circumstances, I find that there is ample justification for the Respondents' claim. Therefore, Item 26 is allowed at 6 units.
[78]
Concerning the Respondents' claim of 3 units under Item 27 for such other services as may be allowed by the Assessment Officer, at paragraph 192 of the Respondents' Submissions, counsel submits that this was for miscellaneous items such as paralegal costs incurred travelling to the University of Alberta to access materials not in the collection at the Department of Justice and to deliver materials to representatives of the client department.
[79]
In response, at paragraph 61 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel argues:
... These are disbursements the Respondents claim as disbursements. If the Respondents are claiming paralegal time, it must be time that counsel could recover. Concerning the "to deliver materials to representatives of the client department" the Respondents are claiming Item 25 to report to the client. This would be a duplicate claim if claiming for time as opposed to disbursements. The "paralegal's costs incurred in travelling to the University" are claimed as disbursements (Potts Aff. p. 92 & Ex. Z pp. 262-4). If this is for paralegal time, it is covered under Item 13(a) which the Respondents have already claimed for. There is no order for second counsel to permit a duplicate claim. Item 27 is not meant to be for duplicate services already compensated for in Tariff B, it is meant for "other" services.
[80]
At paragraph 53 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel contends:
As noted in the AGC's original submission filed June 7, 2013 at paragraph 192, the AGC claims costs under Item 27 for paralegal "costs incurred in travelling to the University of Alberta Law School to access books and materials that were not in Justice's collection ...". I can advise that these materials were the historic or previous versions of the
Food and Drug Act
and Regulations, which were necessary to establish the Respondents' argument under "saving" section 1 of the
Charter
, in the event the Court found that the Applicants had made out a
Charter
infringement. A perusal of the Respondents' MFL filed on the Judicial Review will show that the Respondents covered the legislative history of the relevant Acts and Regulations, as well as the House of Commons Debates from 1920 to 2003(see paragraph 8 - 39 and the Tabs of sources cited there under of the Respondents' MFL filed on the Judicial Review).
[81]
Item 27 of the Table to Tariff B found in the
Federal Courts Rules
, is for "such other services as may be allowed by the assessment officer or ordered by the Court". The Respondents have submitted a claim for the services of a paralegal in relation to research conducted prior to the preparation of the Respondents' Memorandum of Fact and Law. As was held at paragraph 131 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
), Item 27 only comes into play for services not otherwise addressed by items 1 to 26. Concerning the claim by the Respondents, I find that research related to the preparation of a Memorandum of Fact and Law is properly included under Item 2. This being the circumstance, I find that the services claimed are not allowable under Item 27. Therefore, the Respondents' claim under Item 27 is not allowed.
[82]
The Respondents have claimed 154 units under Item 28 for the services of a paralegal at the hearing of the Judicial Review, assisting the Court and parties in locating materials in the parties' Records. In response, the Applicants submit that the Respondents have already claimed for the identical hours for first counsel under Item 14(a). Then at paragraph 63, counsel argues:
Item 14(b) requires a Court order for second counsel. The Respondents can only claim Court time for one counsel. They made an Item 14(a) claim for one counsel. Item 28 covers the work of paralegals to the extent that they reduce the work of the lawyer. Item 28 is not meant to be an additional indemnity permitting double billing for an Item claimed by the lawyer. In the alternative this claim should be limited to the actual Court time of 70'27".
In support of these submissions, counsel refers to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[83]
In Reply, the Respondents submit that they rely on the materials filed June 7, 2013, outlined above.
[84]
The circumstances found in
Air Canada
(
supra
) are essentially the same as the situation before me. At paragraph 15 of the
Air Canada
decision, the Assessment Officer finds:
...By contrast, item G28 does not suggest an indemnity additional to an indemnity already sought and approved for supervising counsel. Rather, it suggests indemnification at "50% of the amount that would be calculated for a solicitor" (my emphasis). That is, the lawyer delegates to the non-lawyer who then provides a service, and the supervising lawyer may bill the client accordingly at a lower hourly rate. Item G28 then reflects a reduced indemnification in the party and party scheme of costs. Further, I doubt that the scheme of this Tariff, requiring a special direction of the Court in the circumstances of items E14(b) and F22(b), was intended to leave unfettered the access to indemnification for non-lawyers ...
Then further down in the paragraph the Assessment Officer concludes, "Here, the Defendants were indemnified already under items D13(a) and E14(a) thereby precluding the claim for item G28". In agreement with these findings and having allowed Item 13(a) and Item 14(a) at paragraphs 67 and 71 respectively, I find that the Respondents' claims under Item 28 may not be allowed. Therefore, Item 28 for the attendance of a paralegal at the Judicial Review hearing is not allowed.
Disbursements
Dr. Silverstone
[85]
The Respondents have submitted disbursements totalling $172,500.00 for the services of Dr. Silverstone, an expert witness who swore two affidavits in response to the Application for Judicial Review. Concerning the services provided by Dr. Silverstone, the Respondents have submitted that the specialized knowledge and expertise of Dr. Silverstone was required in order to properly respond to the Applicants' case. Then, at paragraph 204 of the Respondents Submissions on Costs, counsel argues:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  fees/disbursements where there had been a late, but successful, motion to dismiss the application. AO Parent determined that the parties had to be fully prepared for both the motion to dismiss and the application on its merits on the day the motion to dismiss was heard and, citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  perspective of hindsight. This principle applies to allow this disbursement notwithstanding that Dr. Silverstone's evidence was ultimately ruled irrelevant and therefore inadmissible as a result of the Court deciding the Standing Issue against the applicant.
[86]
Commencing at page 18 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel presents 20 pages outlining reasons why all of the claims for Dr. Silverstone should be denied. At paragraphs 65 and 66, counsel argues that the Applicants motion to strike most of Dr. Silverstone's Affidavit was argued at the Judicial Review hearing but no decision was reached as Dr. Silverstone's evidence was excluded on the grounds that it was irrelevant. The Applicants continue by contending that public policy issues favoured the Applicants, proportionality suggests that the disbursements related to Dr. Silverstone account for over 40 percent of the total amount claimed in the Respondents' Bill of Costs, Dr. Silverstone presented argument instead of impartial expert evidence and Dr. Silverstone went beyond his area of expertise and mis-cited studies. Then, commencing at paragraph 125, counsel submits that the Court excluded Dr. Silverstone's evidence as inadmissible because the parties could not lead evidence on EMPowerplus (EMP), that during the hearing the Court indicated that the efficacy issue, the prime focus of Dr. Silverstone's affidavit was not relevant, and that the Court made it clear that the safety issue raised by Dr. Silverstone was not relevant. Then at paragraph 127, counsel contends that the costs relating to inadmissible evidence should not be allowed on an assessment of costs. In support of this counsel refers to;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Submissions, counsel submits:
The AGC submits that the applicants' submissions at paragraph 88 - 128 ought not to be considered. The Applicants are improperly attempting to obtain, in the context of a costs assessment, a ruling on whether or not Dr. Silverstone's expert evidence would have been admitted at the judicial review, had it not been excluded on the grounds of irrelevance (again, because the Court rejected the applicants' position on the Standing Issue). With respect, the AGC submits that this is not the role of an Assessment Officer.
Counsel for the Respondents continues by submitting that Dr. Silverstone's evidence was necessary and a direct result of the incorrect position the applicants took on the standing issue. Counsel also argues that Dr. Silverstone's evidence was required due to the Applicants'
Charter
argument which was based on the premise that EMP actually treats serious mental illness and that Health Canada's actions denied them access to this treatment, thereby infringing their
Charter
rights. At paragraph 74 of the Respondents' Reply, counsel argues that if the Applicants' premise that EMP is a treatment was disproved, the Applicants'
Charter
argument would fail as it could not be argued that Health Canada denied access to treatment. Finally, at paragraph 75 the Respondents contend:
The Respondents could not predict the outcome of the Standing Issue and had to be prepared for an adverse ruling on that issue and had to prepare their case on the assumption that all of the Applicants' evidence would be admitted. As a result, the AGC submits that the costs associated with Dr. Silverstone were necessary and reasonable - not only the fact of them but also the quantum of them given that he had to respond to almost every affidavit tendered by the applicants.
[88]
Prior to proceeding with a determination of the quantum concerning the disbursements relating to Dr. Silverstone, I must reach a determination whether or not the costs relating to inadmissible evidence should be allowed on a party-and-party assessment of costs or whether, as submitted by the Respondents, hindsight should not be a factor in an assessment of costs and therefore, notwithstanding that Dr. Silverstone's evidence was ultimately ruled irrelevant and therefore inadmissible, the related disbursements should be allowed.
[89]
At paragraph 76 of the Reasons for Order and Order dated January 20, 2010, the Court held:
Much of the contested evidence has been tendered in anticipation that the
Charter
claim evidence of non-Applicant users is relevant to the present Application. The determination of the narrow scope of the present Application as found in the preceding Section of these reasons has rendered this evidence as irrelevant. I find that both the Respondents' and the Applicants' strike motions can be dealt with on this basis. The law with respect to the relevance and admissibility of evidence is as follows:
Facts in issue, which are sometimes called "principal" facts, are those necessary by law to establish the claim, liability or defence, forming the subject-matter of the proceedings; and which are in dispute between the parties [footnote omitted].
[...]
Relevancy
must be distinguished from
admissibility
, of which, though the primary, it is by no means the sole condition. Evidence may be relevant and yet, on grounds of convenience or policy, inadmissible. Indeed, this exclusion of matter otherwise relevant has been called the distinguishing feature of the English law of evidence. It is correct then, in deciding whether evidence is admissible, to ask first whether the evidence is
relevant
and, thereafter, whether there are any rules or discretions, based on convenience or policy, which nonetheless make this
relevant
evidence
inadmissible
. [Emphasis in the original]
(
Phipson on Evidence
, 16th Ed. (London: Sweet and Maxwell, 2005), paras. 7 - 02, 7 - 05)
Further, the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is instructive:
Evidence is relevant if, as a matter of logic and human experience, it renders the existence or absence of a material fact in issue more or less likely [...]. Evidence will be irrelevant either if it does not make the fact to which it is directed more or less likely, or
if the fact to which the evidence is directed is not material to the proceedings
.
Relevance is contextual in that it depends on the facts in issue, the position taken by the parties in respect of those facts, and the other evidence adduced in relation to those facts: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 338 (S.C.C.).
Because relevance is contextual, a court will often be unable to determine relevance at the time the evidence is proffered, but will receive the evidence conditionally and determine the relevance of the evidence after the evidentiary picture has been fully developed
. It does not follow, however, that because relevance often cannot be determined when the evidence is tendered, that relevance should not be addressed when the evidence is tendered.
If a court is satisfied when the evidence is tendered that the evidence is irrelevant, it should so hold and refuse to admit the evidence. A court should not hear evidence on the chance that it might somehow, at some time, in some way become relevant in the proceedings
. [Emphasis is the Court's]
[90]
Concerning the evidence of Dr. Silverstone, at paragraph 84 of the Reasons for Order and Order, the Court held:
For the same reason applied to the expert evidence of Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Popper with respect to the Respondents' strike motion, I find that the expert evidence of Dr. Silverstone, a psychiatrist, which also goes to the treatment effect of EMpowerplus, is irrelevant.
[91]
Concerning Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Popper, at paragraph 79 and 80 of the Reasons, the Court states:
While it is an undisputed fact that users of EMpowerplus report an improvement in their mental health as a result of taking a recommended dosage of the product, controversy exists as to whether EMpowerplus treats mental illness and is, therefore, "efficacious", or whether EMpowerplus merely creates a placebo response because it is expected to treat, and is, therefore, only "effective". Given the limited scope of the present Application as found, I find that the question does not constitute a fact in issue because it can only be advanced if the
Charter
rights of users are in play. This was the strategy advanced by the Applicants, but it has failed.
As a result I find that the following affidavit evidence is irrelevant: the evidence of Ms. Coulson and Ms. Oxby which goes to prove the positive effect that EMpowerplus has had on their lives; the evidence of Mr. LaJeunesse, a past executive with the Canadian Mental Health Association, which goes to support user claims; and the expert opinion evidence of Dr. Kaplan, a psychologist, and Dr. Popper, a psychiatrist, which goes to the treatment effect of EMpowerplus.
[92]
Then at paragraph 85 of the Reasons for Order and Order dated January 20, 2010, the Court concluded that "the evidence found to be irrelevant is inadmissible".
[93]
In summary, I find that the Court determined the evidence of Dr. Silverstone to be irrelevant and inadmissible due to the narrow scope of the Judicial Review which is as a result of the Court findings in paragraphs 57 through 74 of the Reasons for Order and Order dated January 20, 2010.
[94]
Concerning the Respondents' "hindsight argument", I find that the matter before me may be distinguished from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Assessment Officer found that, as a result of the motion to dismiss, "the parties had to be fully prepared to proceed on both the motion to dismiss and the application on its merits". In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> there is no indication that the Court found the expert evidence inadmissible. On the other hand, I am faced with a finding by the Court that the evidence of Dr. Silverstone is irrelevant and inadmissible. Given this finding, it is necessary to determine the effect of the inadmissibility finding and not simply allow the disbursements based on the premise that the parties had to be fully prepared to proceed.
[95]
Concerning relevance and admissibility, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court held:
... In cases in which experts are called by both parties and they give conflicting opinions, the Court has to choose the opinion of one of the experts as preferable to the other, unless the Court chooses to reject both opinions and substitute its own based on the evidence, but the fact that one expert's report is rejected, or not accepted in full, would not justify non-payment of his fees for the preparation of same,
unless the Court finds that the requisitioning of such a report was entirely unnecessary or the contents useless
.... (emphasis added)
[96]
Referring to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 51 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Merck) the Assessment Officer held:
Since the Federal Court ruled that most of the evidence attached to the Affidavit of Frank Tassone was "unnecessary" and that "most of it was inadmissible," it is my opinion that the Apotex Respondent should not be entitled to claim these expert fees in their entirety. For these reasons and considering the proposition expressed in Grace M.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that "a result of zero dollars would be absurd", I exercise my discretion and allow a reduced amount of $500.00 for the associated expert fees of Frank Tassone.
[97]
The Assessment Officer appears to allow a reduced amount due to the fact that the Court did not find the evidence entirely inadmissible. On the review of the Assessment Officer's decision, at paragraphs 31 and 32 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Merck Review
) the Court held:
The assessment officer himself noted in paragraph [12] of his reasons that, at paragraphs [60] and [61] of his reasons, Justice Mosley found that
it was improper for Apotex to use the Tassone affidavit to submit evidence
, that Apotex made no real effort to explain how most of the material annexed to that affidavit would be relevant and admissible and that it was unnecessary and excessive to "dump" the U.S. Trial evidence into the record by the use of the Tassone affidavit. He ruled that
most of the material under cover of the Tassone affidavit was inadmissible and he strongly discouraged "any repetition of this practice".
In light of Justice Mosley's comments I consider the assessment officer's reliance on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ill-founded and the resulting amount allowed for the disbursement to Mr. Tassone to be so unreasonable that an error in principle must have been the cause. In the result,
I would reduce the assessed costs by $500.00 to nil on this account
. (emphasis added)
[98]
In
Merck Review
, the Court noted that Justice Mosley found the affidavit to be unnecessary and excessive. Therefore, even though not all of the material under cover of the Tassone Affidavit was inadmissible, the Court reduced the assessed amount to nil. I find this to be consistent with the Court's finding of necessity in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
).
[99]
In the matter before me, the Court found the evidence of Dr. Silverstone to be irrelevant and inadmissible and, following the findings in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Merck Review
(
supra
), the disbursements claimed for the services of Dr. Silverstone are not allowed.
[100]
At paragraph 132 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits:
If it is accepted that there should be no costs allowed for Dr. Silverstone, then in addition to his expert fees, the following costs should be also disallowed:
a. Item 8 concerning Dr. Silverstone;
b. Item 9 concerning Dr. Silverstone;
c. $1322.50 for transcripts (Potts Aff. Ex. BB p. 325);
d. The part of the copying and tabs for the affidavits which is attributable to Dr. Silverstone' affidavit (Potts Aff. pp. 92-3, Ex. Z 265-8, 270);
e. The part of the Respondents' Record and courier charges attributable to Dr. Silverstone's affidavit.
The Respondents submitted no rebuttal concerning these points.
[101]
Having found that the disbursements for Dr. Silverstone's expert fees could not be allowed, I also find that the fees and disbursements associated with the cross-examination of Dr. Silverstone, the disbursements related to the duplication service and filing of his affidavit should not be allowed. This being the circumstance, the amounts claimed under Item 8 and Item 9 for the cross-examination of Dr. Silverstone on August 5-7, 2009 and the disbursement of $1,322.50, for the transcript of the cross-examination of Dr. Silverstone are not allowed. Further, the amounts of $140.59 and $86.46 respectively for the duplication and courier charges associated with the Affidavits of Dr. Silverstone are not allowed.
Travel
[102]
Concerning disbursements for travel, counsel for the Applicants has raised two issues, travel costs for second counsel and travel costs for meeting with clients and preparing witnesses. I will address each of these issues prior to reaching a determination concerning the quantum of the disbursements to be allowed.
[103]
At paragraph 200 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel argues that travel costs for second counsel may be allowed even in the absence of a direction of the Court allowing fees for second counsel. In support of this, counsel refers to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[104]
At paragraph 135 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits:
...The Applicants take no issue with the travel costs of "one" counsel for examinations for the judicial review (not on the motions) and for attendance at the judicial review. The Court did not exercise its discretion to order travel fees for any counsel. Nor did it exercise its discretion for second counsel fees. An Assessment Officer has the discretion to allow travel disbursements even when the Court has not awarded travel fees. However, considering that neither travel fees nor second counsel fees were granted, the Applicants submit that travel fees for second counsel should not be allowed. In the context of litigation seeking only a declaration with litigants who did not have a budget for second counsel, travel expenses for second counsel are also excessive. Mr. Shaw was lead counsel. All of the travel expenses for Ms. Kaminski and Ms. Oltean should not be allowed.
In support of their submissions, counsel refers to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[105]
At paragraph 77 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel argues:
Ms. Kaminski was co-lead counsel on the file from 2003 - 2008. Mr. Shaw was lead counsel throughout this matter and Ms. Oltean was co-counsel from 2008 to the present. Both Mr. Shaw and Ms. Oltean prepared and presented argument at the hearing of the judicial review equally, with Ms Oltean dealing primarily with the evidentiary issues and Mr. Shaw addressing the substantive
Charter
issues. Given the number of witnesses on both sides, the number of issues involved procedural, evidentiary and substantive, second counsel on this matter is amply justified ....
[106]
Counsel for the Applicants and Respondents have presented what appear to be conflicting decisions concerning second counsel travel costs. The two decisions presented by the Applicants did not allow second counsel travel costs and the two decisions presented by the Respondents allowed the travel expenses for second counsel in the absence of a Direction of the Court awarding second counsel fees pursuant to Item 14 (b) of the Table to Tariff B of the
Federal Courts Rules
. Having reviewed the case law presented, I find that Assessment Officers have the jurisdiction to allow reasonable and necessary travel expenses for second counsel, when justified by the evidence presented, even when the Court has not made a direction pursuant to Item 14 (b). However, whether or not there is a direction of the Court pursuant to Item 14(b), when the evidence does not support second counsel travel expenses, an Assessment Officer is not bound to allow them.
[107]
Having reviewed the Court Record, the submissions and evidence presented and having confirmed that both Mr. Shaw and Ms. Oltean were active participants and presented argument before the Court, I find that the circumstances of this matter justify reasonable and necessary travel expenses for two counsels for the cross-examinations on affidavits and the attendance at the judicial review hearing.
[108]
Concerning travel costs to meet with clients and prepare witnesses, commencing at paragraph 136 of the Applicants Memorandum, counsel makes submissions concerning the following trips:
1. Mr. Shaw's trip to Ottawa January 19 to 21, 2009 to meet with clients;
2. Mr. Shaw's and Ms. Oltean's trip to Ottawa March 7 to 13, 2009 for examinations;
3. Mr. Shaw's and Ms. Oltean's trip to Ottawa May 5 to 7, 2009 for examinations and to meet with the client;
4. Mr. Shaw's and Ms. Oltean's trip to Vancouver June 21 to 26, 2009 for the examinations of Mr. Neske and Ms. Seeling, and;
5. Ms. Kaminski's and Mr. Shaw's trip to Calgary November 18 to 21, 2003 for the examinations of Mr. Brosseau and Ms. Jarvis.
[109]
Counsel for the Applicants contends that the Respondents are claiming travel disbursements to meet with the client representative, review the Applicants' affidavits and prepare for examinations. Counsel also submits that as there were no examinations scheduled for the periods in March 2009 and May 2009 making the travel inessential. Concerning the trip to Vancouver in June 2009, counsel submits that the six days are not warranted as the examination of Mr. Neske had duration of three and one half hours on June 23, 2009 and the examination of Ms. Seeling did not take place until the hearing of the Judicial Review. Counsel also argues that the trip to Calgary in November 2003, for the examination of Mr. Brosseau and Ms. Jarvis, is not allowable as the examinations relate to a motion and the examination of Ms. Jarvis actually took place on August 1, 2003. For all of these trips, counsel argues that there was no urgency to make these trips essential or necessary, therefore, they should not be allowed. Counsel's final submissions concerning travel are found at paragraphs 156 to 158 of the Applicants' Memorandum and relate to a change fee for air fair on November 27, 2009 which counsel argues is not justified, a charge for airfare which they argue should have been split with another file and long distance charges for telephone calls while counsel was on travel status, for which, counsel argues, there is no evidence that the calls relate to this file.
[110]
Commencing at paragraph 78 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits that contrary to the Applicants' submissions the test for assessing whether disbursements are allowable is whether they are reasonable and necessary. Counsel argues that most of the Respondents' affiants were located in Ottawa and Vancouver and it was appropriate for counsel to travel to these locations to prepare the witnesses. Counsel further contends that travel to prepare witnesses is not done because of urgency but because it is reasonable and necessary to assist the witness with their affidavits and to prepare for their cross-examination. Concerning the cross-examination of Ms. Seeling, counsel argues that there was a requirement to prepare the affiant as the Applicants did not inform the Respondents that the cross-examination was not to take place until the day tentatively scheduled for the examination. Finally, commencing at paragraph 89 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel argues that the change fee was as a result of the hearing on November 27, 2009 concluding much earlier than anticipated, that the air fare for Mr. Shaw's trip of November 18 to 21, 2003 should not be split with another file because the main purpose of travel related to this file and that there is no reason to suggest that the long distance calls claimed for the same trip did not relate to this file.
[111]
Concerning the Respondents' trips on the various dates outlined above, to meet with the client representative, review the Applicants' affidavits and prepare for examinations, I find that to second guess Respondents' counsel concerning trips which represent prudent and reasonable representation of the client in a litigation process is tantamount to hindsight. As was held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "indemnification of disbursements is not a function of hindsight but whether, in the circumstances existing at the time a litigant's solicitor made the decision to incur the expenditure, it represented prudent and reasonable representation of the client". On the other hand, I find that the trips to Calgary by Ms. Kaminski and Mr. Shaw from November 18 to 21, 2003, for the cross-examination of Mr. Brosseau and Ms. Jarvis, relate to the Respondents' Motion to Strike. As the costs of the Motion and the fees for the cross-examinations have not been allowed, I find that the costs of travel may not be allowed. Given this the Applicant's concerns related to the splitting of air fare and long distance telephone calls are moot.
[112]
Concerning the November 27 to 28, 2003 trip to Vancouver for the cross-examination of Mr. Neske, although it was not contested by the Applicants, having found that this cross-examination related to the Respondents' Motion to Strike, and in keeping with my finding concerning Mr. Brosseau and Ms. Jarvis, above, I find that the costs of travel for the November 2003 trip to Vancouver may not be allowed. Also, having found that the Respondents are not entitled to costs for the Applicants' Motion to amend their application (Motion Doc. No. 52), I find that the travel claimed for Ms. Kaminski and Mr. Shaw for May 9, 2008, to attend the hearing of the Applicants motion, may not be allowed. Further, as the amounts claimed for Jessica Stalknecht's expenses, incurred while on travel status, have not been contested, they are allowed as being reasonable and necessary expenses. Also, concerning the change fee, for the flight on November 27, 2009, I find the Respondents' explanation of the circumstances to be reasonable and allow the claim as presented.
[113]
Finally, as the Applicants have not contested the actual amounts claimed as being unreasonable, and having determined which trips were reasonable and necessary and which trips were not, I have reviewed the travel disbursements claimed and, subject to the reasons above, I find the remaining expenses claimed to be reasonable and necessary. Therefore, travel disbursements are assessed and allowed for a total amount of $36,776.23.
Court Reporter Fees
[114]
Concerning Court Reporter fees, at paragraph 143 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits:
$4,339.65 is claimed for daily transcripts of every day of the Judicial Review except for the last day. Generally daily transcripts are ordered in necessary when "evidence" is being called, which, because this was a judicial review based on affidavits, did not happen until the last day. Even when evidence is called, daily transcripts are generally a luxury that is not allowed as costs, especially when not ordered by the party liable to pay costs. The applicants oppose this cost as an unnecessary luxury ....
In support of their submissions, counsel refers to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[115]
In reply, counsel for the Respondents argues that the Janssen-Ortho decision related to real time reporting not daily transcripts and that the other case law referred to by the Applicants are discretionary decisions which do not set out any specific principles. Then at paragraph 83 of the Respondents' Reply, counsel submits:
In this case, daily transcripts were required because the parties' submissions were greatly amplified orally, beyond what was set out in the parties' written arguments. Daily transcript costs are not unusual or unreasonable for a hearing of this duration, complexity and given the number and quality of the issues.
[116]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Assessment Officer, with reference to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
), held that daily transcripts for opening statements and argument were not allowed, only allowing for verbal testimony and reasons. In the present case, the Respondents' justification for daily copy is that the oral submissions were amplified beyond that set out in the parties' written argument. I do not find the Respondents' submissions to be sufficient justification to allow for the expense of daily transcripts as there were no witnesses called on the dates daily transcripts were ordered. Further, I do not think it is reasonable for the Applicants to be required to reimburse the Respondents for an expense that was not reasonable and necessary. Therefore, the Respondents claim of $4,339.65 for daily copy of the Judicial Review Hearing is not allowed.
[117]
Concerning other Court Reporter disbursements, although not raised by the Applicants, I find that the amounts claimed for the transcript of the cross-examination of Mr. Brosseau and Ms. Jarvis (Amicus-December 3, 2003 - $195.20) cannot be allowed as the cross-examination related to the Respondents Motion to Strike, for which no costs were awarded. Also, the disbursement for transcript from the hearing of the Applicants' Motion to amend their application (Motion Doc. No. 52), held May 9, 2008, cannot be allowed as no costs were awarded for the motion. Finally, as was held at paragraph 101, above, the disbursement of $1,322.50, for the transcript of the cross-examination of Dr. Silverstone is not allowed. Therefore, for the above reasons, disbursements for Court Reporters are allowed for a total of $10,031.38.
On-Line Computer Searches
[118]
The Respondents have claimed $5,959.98 for Quicklaw searches between 2003 and 2009, with the majority of the expense being incurred in 2009. The evidence supporting these expenses is found in the Affidavit of Tabitha Potts sworn February 1, 2013. At paragraph 16 of her Affidavit, Ms. Potts states:
Attached to my affidavit and marked as Exhibit "I" is a copy of the charts indicating the amount billed to file 2-98528 to recover charges for on-line research in the total amount of $538.51. I am advised by Susan Seutter, finance specialist with Department of Justice and verily believe that during the 2003/2004 fiscal year we had a flat rate per month agreement with Lexis Nexis. The invoices from Lexis Nexis detailed the cost for each search based on search time and were not calculated pro-rata to adjust to the flat rate charge. I am further advised by Susan Seutter that upon receipt of the Lexis Nexis statement, our finance specialists or library technicians would create the charts attached as Exhibit "I" to pro-rate all the searches charges so they equalled the flat rate amount and then finance would post the amount from the charts to the applicable files.
At paragraphs 34 and 40, similar evidence is provided for the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 fiscal years.
[119]
At paragraph 144 of the Applicants' Reply, counsel submits that M.M. Orkin,
The Law on Costs
, 2nd Ed. (Toronto): Canada Law Book, 2012 at page 2-290, states:
The court has allowed a disbursement for a Quicklaw search, but the trend has been to disallow them in absence of special circumstances. The reasonableness of the amount claimed must be critically examined. However, an Alberta court ruled that in the reality of current legal practice computerized research is expected of counsel both by clients and the court and consequently disallowed a disbursement for research ...
[120]
Then commencing at paragraph 145, counsel submits:
The Alberta decision Orkin cites makes it clear that in Alberta, the province this matter was  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  fees are not recoverable because it reduces counsel time which is recoverable as a costs fee (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLii) at [19-25]. If this same review had been held in the Court of Queen's Bench, instead of Federal Court, the Respondents' Quicklaw claim would be disallowed as overhead.
Probably because most users of Quicklaw have switched to monthly rates, Courts have generally switched to treating Quicklaw as no-costs overhead.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at [19];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at [78-81];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at [39]
The Respondents are billed a flat monthly fee for Quicklaw but do not disclose the amount (Potts Aff. pp. 4, 6, 7 and Potts Cross pp. 1-4). Quicklaw was available for $180/month, and free at courthouse libraries (Buckley Aff. Vol. 1 pp. 3-4, Exs. C-E). Some of the single day "flat fee" charges are excessive (April 6/09 of $699.03, September 29/09 $573.19 and September 11/09 of $408.12), exceeding by multiples the going $180 monthly flat fee available to the Applicants. It is likely the Respondents have a flat fee for a group of lawyers, many of whom do not use Quicklaw, making the charges for those that do excessive. If this is the case then the Respondents are really seeking to recover office overhead which is not reasonably necessary for this litigation. In 2009 they are claiming $4,725.02 for Quicklaw (equal to 26.25 monthly flat fee months at the rate available to the Applicants).
As indicated earlier Potts Aff. Exs. I and Y are most likely Quicklaw for motions. It is unclear what amount of Ex. EE is for motions, but it is unlikely that all of those searches were for the judicial review. The length of the searches and the necessity for them is also unclear. The Respondents give no reasons why any specific search was necessary. Nor do they indicate what any search was for. There is simply a general averment the cost was "reasonable and necessary" (Respondents' Memorandum at [201]). It is an error in law to allow a disbursement without evidence it was essential (
Diversified Products Corp
, supra, last page). Because computer research has become more widely used, evidence that it is relevant has become more important (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Respondents give no reasons why these expenses were necessary other than a general statement that they were "reasonable and necessary (Respondents' Memorandum at [201]). Ms. Potts could not tell us the purpose of any search (Potts Cross p. 6 L4 top. 7  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  EE of her Affidavit were the amounts paid to Quicklaw. She was unsure (Potts Cross p. 4 L6 to p.5 L4).
[121]
At paragraph 84 of the Respondents' Reply, counsel submits that legal research costs for a case of this kind are necessary and reasonable and that volumes 20 to 33 of the Respondents' Record were authorities.
[122]
It is apparent that the jurisprudence, concerning on-line legal research, is evolving. This is creating a situation where there is some inconsistency of application. At paragraph 18 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  it was held:
Concerning the disbursement claimed for Quicklaw, although I have no hesitation to allow legal research, I find a claim of $200.00 for a proceeding of this type excessive. In the circumstances of an appeal from a motion for an extension of time, and not having been provided with adequate evidence to justify the amount claimed, and considering that the Respondent's Book of Authorities contained only ten decisions, I allow Quicklaw in the amount of $75.00 in recognition that some on-line legal research would have been necessary.
However, at paragraph 19 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  litigation and was not prepared to award costs for the expenses. Then, at paragraph 152 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  required to spend a disproportionate amount of money to prove a disbursement, the Affidavit of Mira Rinne and Janssen's Written Submissions provide very little evidence to support hundreds of computer searches. I think that it is a well known fact that computer research is becoming more and more widely used. This being the situation, I am of the opinion that the burden of proving that computer research is required has declined but that the requirement to provide evidence that the research is relevant is becoming more important. For these reasons I will allow computer research but I will conservatively allow for approximately one half of the searches claimed as the evidence of relevance was limited ....
[123]
The approach taken in the provincial courts has been of a somewhat more consistent nature.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court undertakes an extensive review of the jurisprudence relating to computerized legal research in that province and concludes:
... the disbursement claimed in these cases is for access to the legal databases and is based upon the time spent doing research for the particular client on the particular matter. There is no suggestion that the disbursement is meant to reimburse the law firm for the cost of computers as capital assets. In my view, disbursements for electronic legal research are similar to disbursements for photocopying; it is the copies, not the copiers, that are being paid for.
Nevertheless, I am bound by the weight of authority and must therefore refuse to allow the disbursement. Perhaps the time has come for our Court of Appeal to revisit this issue, but in light of the existing authority, I am not in a position to do so.
At paragraph 81 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court held:
As for the charge for QuickLaw, it is true that in some cases, QuickLaw is a necessary and proper disbursement. But that is not a given. There must be some evidence justifying its use. Here, I was not told why QuickLaw searches were necessary or proper or why searches could not have been conducted using free online services, as opposed to a pay-per-use service such as QuickLaw. I am not aware that this case involved any unusual legal issues requiring QuickLaw's use.
The plaintiff has not justified the necessity or propriety of this charge. It is disallowed.
And at paragraph 39 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court held:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  on the subject of Quicklaw disbursements, the court stated:
Other specific items
$37.55 for Quicklaw research: There was a time years ago when online research was a novel development and lawyers paid for this research by the time spent and could track individual client files. Most lawyers, including Mr. Richey, no longer do this. They pay the much less costly monthly fee and take advantage of the system's ability to track individual clients or files and bill out the amount that would have been charged, had the lawyer subscribed to the "pay as you go" plan. That amount is basically a fiction because it is not an actual expense to the lawyer.
Performing legal research is part of a lawyer's job. In my view, the ability to do online research is merely a convenience to lawyers, which is now available for a minimal cost. Absolutely free services are quickly becoming available, eg. through CanLII, which will in time as their databases grow likely give the commercial services a run for their money. As such, it is my view that online research is part of overhead and is not a necessary disbursement that can be passed along on a party and party basis.
I am not prepared to allow an amount for Quicklaw searches.
[124]
From the case law submitted, there appears to be a trend toward limiting or eliminating allowances for on-line computer research. Although Courts have found circumstances when online research could be seen as part of overhead and not a necessary disbursement to be passed along on a party and party assessment, I find that there are still circumstances when it may be a justifiable claim. As was held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  photocopying. However, in keeping with
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relevant. Further, considering that the charges for on-line research can mount up, the justification for on-line charges claimed is essential.
[125]
With this in mind, and considering the jurisprudence above, I find that, in order to determine whether on-line searches are reasonable and necessary, there is a need for the production of evidence concerning the relevance and necessity of the on-line searches claimed in the Bill of Costs. Further, given the Respondents' evidence that they pay a flat-rate monthly fee, there is a need to provide evidence of how these charges were calculated for this specific matter while ensuring that the amounts claimed in the Bill of Costs are a reflection of the actual disbursements. In light of these requirements, it is important to note that, despite the need for proof, the cost of proving the expenditures for computer research should not exceed the amount claimed (see:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Taking this into consideration, I find that, in the present assessment, the Respondents have not provided the evidence required to justify on-line computer searches.
[126]
Concerning the relevance and necessity of the on-line searches claimed by the Respondents, I have reviewed the evidence provided in the Affidavit of Tabitha Potts and the cross-examination of Ms. Potts and find that there is no evidence concerning relevance. The Respondents have provided no evidence concerning what the searches relate to, whether they relate to the Judicial Review or a motion, or whether they relate to the
Charter
challenge or the striking of an affidavit. On cross-examination, Ms. Potts was not able to provide any assistance in determining which searches related to motions and which did not. As evidence of necessity, the Respondents have submitted that 20 volumes of their Application Record consisted of authorities. However, there is no evidence concerning the cost of researching those specific authorities and there is no evidence suggesting which of the on-line searches related to those authorities. It is left to the Assessment Officer to reach a conclusion concerning the relevance and necessity of the searches based on the dates of the searches. This is an impossible task. Without evidence relating to the subject matter being researched, it is impossible to reach a determination concerning the relevance and necessity of individual searches. Therefore, it is impossible to make a finding of relevance and necessity concerning on-line searches based on nothing more than the volume of authorities filed.
[127]
Concerning the flat-rate fees paid by the Respondents for Quicklaw services, I have reviewed the evidence provided in the Affidavit of Tabitha Potts and the cross-examination of Ms. Potts and find that Ms. Potts was unable to provide any information concerning the specifics of the fees. Although the Respondents have presented some evidence suggesting that the flat-rate fees were pro-rated, there is no evidence concerning how this was done. Further, the evidence of the Applicants suggests that the flat-rate fee for a sole practitioner could be as low as $180.00 per month. Considering this, the pro-rated charges for on-line computer searches seem excessive given that there were two lawyers on record for the Respondents. As suggested by the Applicants, even if the Respondents have a flat fee for a group of lawyers, the amount claimed could be inflated due to inconsistent use by practitioners. Also, I have not been provided with any specific evidence concerning the nature of the Respondents' flat-rate per month agreement with Lexis Nexis. Without this evidence, it is impossible to know whether the calculations suggested by the Respondents are appropriate or whether the on-line searches being claimed should constitute office overhead.
[128]
Having found that the Respondents have not provided evidence concerning the relevance and necessity of the searches or the nature and application of the flat rate fee, the Respondents' disbursements for on-line computer searches are not allowed.
Photocopying
[129]
The Respondents have claimed a total of $12,479.25 for photocopying. In support of this, at paragraph 197 of the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, counsel argues that the disbursements for photocopying were reasonable and necessary and supported by invoices.
[130]
At paragraph 150 of the Applicants' Memorandum, counsel submits that the Respondents' disbursement of $5,602.33 for the duplication of their Application Record may be due to the production of 6 copies of the Record rather than the 5 copies normally produced. Counsel contends:
...Although the Potts Affidavit at page 93 claims 5 copies were made, at Ex. Z page 276 it says that 6 copies plus the original were made (for 7 copies in total - 3 copies for the Respondents). Such costs are not recoverable without an order for second and/or third counsel. Copies for clients are not recoverable.
Then at paragraph 152, the Applicants argue that the Respondents have claimed $1,275.55 for an additional copy of the Applicants' Record and $231.54 for copies of the Applicants' Affidavits and that the Applicants should not be responsible for making extra copies of their own documents. The only other submission of the Applicants concerning photocopying is found at paragraph 155 of the Applicants' Memorandum where counsel submits that the copying of unidentified research books and associated travel in the amount of $115.00 should not be allowed.
[131]
At paragraph 85 of the Respondents' Reply, counsel submits that the claims for photocopies have been supported by invoices, that there were two counsels involved and each counsel required a copy of the materials. Concerning the copying of unidentified research materials, counsel submits that the research books were copies of historic versions of the relevant acts and regulation as well as House of Commons Debates.
[132]
I have reviewed the Respondents' evidence concerning photocopying, as presented in the Affidavit of Tabatha Potts and have confirmed that all of the amounts claimed are supported by invoices from external service providers.
[133]
Concerning the Respondents' claim for photocopying their Application Record, I have been presented with no case law which stands for the Applicants' proposition that the costs of duplicating an Application Record for second counsel is not allowable unless the Court awards costs for second counsel under Item 14(b). Further I find that the Respondents' suggestion that both counsel working on a file require a copy of all materials to be reasonable in the event of a judicial review of this type. Under these circumstances, I find that it was reasonable and necessary for the Respondents to produce 6 copies of their Application Record.
[134]
Concerning the additional copy of the Applicants' Affidavits and Application Record, I find the same. Further, concerning the Application Record, at page 279 of the Affidavit of Tabatha Potts there is an indication that the copy was produced from a compact disc (CD). I find it is reasonable to produce a paper copy of a document which is stored on a CD, therefore this disbursement is allowed as claimed at $1,275.55. On the other hand, concerning the Applicants Affidavits, at page 172 of the Potts Affidavit there is an indication that two copies of the documents were produced. I find that only one additional copy is justifiable for second counsel, therefore, this disbursement is allowed at the amount of $115.77.
[135]
Concerning the copying of relevant acts, regulations and House of Commons Debates, I have reviewed the evidence found at Exhibit Z to the Affidavit of Tabitha Potts and find that the portion claimed for travel may not be allowed as the paralegal was not on travel status at the time of the expenditure. Therefore, I will deduct $25.00 for the travel charge.
[136]
Although the Applicants have provided no submissions concerning the photocopying related to the motions claimed, having found that no costs were awarded for any motions, I find that I am unable to allow any costs for photocopies related to the motions. Using the Disbursements Justification and Notes found at Exhibit B to the Affidavit of Tabatha Potts, I have removed any disbursements relating to motions. Further, as mentioned at paragraph 101, above, the cost of photocopying the Affidavits of Dr. Silverstone have been removed from the amount claimed for photocopying disbursements. Finally, as the Applicants have not opposed any other amounts claimed for photocopying, they are allowed as presented in the Respondents' Bill of Costs. Therefore, for the above reasons, the Respondents' claim for photocopies is allowed for a total of $9,741.37.
Courier
[137]
The Respondents have claimed courier charges of $1,663.26. In support, the Respondents submit that the disbursements were reasonable and necessary given the volume of materials and the distance between the parties. In support of their submissions, the Respondents referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> which held:
Although some disbursements may be seen as normal office overhead, I find that facsimile and courier costs do not fall into this category as they may be attributed to a specific file. In its rebuttal the respondent submits that all of the photocopies, courier and facsimile charges were necessary for the motion. Having reviewed the file and the materials filed in support of the motion to strike the Notice of Appeal, and noting that counsel for the respondent practices in British Columbia while counsel for the appellant practices in Ontario, thus increasing facsimile and courier costs, I find the disbursements for photocopies, facsimiles and courier to be reasonable and necessary. Therefore, the respondent's disbursements are allowed as claimed.
[138]
In reply, the Applicants refer to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
), at paragraph 158, in support of the contention that they should not be responsible for courier charges for delivery to the Respondents' client where regular mail would have sufficed.
[139]
By way of rebuttal, the Respondents submit that courier costs are reasonable given the locations of the parties and clients.
[140]
I have reviewed the Respondents' evidence and find that the disbursements for courier are well documented. However, as was the case with other disbursements, I find that those courier costs associated with motions may not be allowed. Further, as mentioned at paragraph 101, above, the cost of couriering the Affidavits of Dr. Silverstone have been removed from the amount claimed for courier disbursements. Finally, concerning the Applicants' contention that they should not be responsible for courier deliveries to the Respondents' client, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
supra
) it was held that:
...The evidence indicates material being produced for lawyers in more than one city because Gowlings is a national law firm: the Plaintiffs should not be saddled with such costs. The claims of $26.62 and $86.15 (postage), compared to the large claims for couriers and facsimiles, emphasize the absence of any attempt at cost-effective options for all disbursements. It may be the prerogative of the Seed Hawk Defendants to retain counsel in multiple cities, but the associated and extra costs, i.e. long distance facsimile transmissions etc., are not the Plaintiffs' responsibility. As well,
although communications with the client may be warranted, there is no evidence that regular mail would have been inadequate
.... (emphasis added)
Although the Respondents' evidence justifying the necessity of sending documents from counsel to client by courier is limited, the total amount for couriers to the client is $121.35 spread over the nine years of the litigation. Given that counsel and client were in two different cities, Edmonton and Ottawa, I find the disbursements to be reasonable and necessary to the litigation process. For the above reasons, disbursements for couriers are allowed for a total of $993.45
Courthouse Searches
[141]
The final disbursement objected to by the Applicants is found at paragraph 154 of the Applicants' Memorandum and relates to an unsubstantiated court search at Alberta Justice in the amount of $170.00. By way of rebuttal, at paragraph 87 of the Respondents' Reply Submissions, counsel submits that the court search relates to a file raised by Applicants' counsel at the cross-examination of Dr. Silverstone.
[142]
Although the receipt provided by the Respondents provides no detail concerning what the search related to, given the submissions of counsel for the Respondents, that it relates to a file raised by the Applicants, I find that it was reasonable for the Respondents to conduct a search as part of this litigation. Therefore, the disbursement is allowed as claimed at $170.00.
[143]
As the amounts claimed for corporate searches and fee paid to the Federal Court pursuant to Tariff A have not been contested, they are allowed as claimed at $6.00 and $2,743.75 respectively.
[144]
Finally, concerning the Respondents' Further Bill of Costs filed July 4, 2013, at the hearing of the assessment, counsel for the Applicants submitted that they take no position concerning the disbursements claimed as being unreasonable.
[145]
I have reviewed the Respondents' Further Bill of Costs which claims disbursements for courier and photocopying related to the assessment of costs, and find that the disbursements claimed are reasonable and necessary for an assessment of this complexity. Therefore the disbursements claimed are allowed as presented.
[146]
For the above reasons, the Respondents' Revised Bill of Costs is assessed and allowed at $127,487.18 and the Respondents' Further Bill of Costs is assessed and allowed at $822.27. I will issue a separate Certificate of Assessment for each Bill of Costs.

Truehope Nutritional  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Motifs
[1]
Preston, Officier taxateur
[Traduction]: Dans les Motifs de l'ordonnance et ordonnance en date du 20 janvier 2010, la Cour a rejeté la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Puis, dans une ordonnance rendue à la suite des plaidoiries concernant les dépens, en date du 19 novembre 2012, la Cour a adjugé les dépens de la demande aux défendeurs, précisant que les dépens seraient taxés selon la colonne III du tarif B des
Règles des Cours fédérales
.
[2]
Le 6 juin 2013, les défendeurs ont déposé un mémoire de dépens révisé le 4 juillet 2013, un mémoire de dépens complémentaire sur les débours liés à la taxation des dépens. L'audience de taxation des dépens a eu lieu par téléconférence le 11 juillet 2013.
[3]
Au début de l'audience, l'avocate des défendeurs a fait savoir que les frais dont il était fait état au titre des photocopies pour le 24 juillet 2003, le 25 juillet 2003 et le 5 avril 2004 étaient supprimés du mémoire de dépens, car ces photocopies concernaient des requêtes dont les frais avaient déjà été retirés. Les défendeurs ont également retiré les sommes demandées pour des photocopies faites par la Cour fédérale le 27 janvier 2009.
[4]
Les parties ont présenté des arguments détaillés sur le barème des dépens qui devrait être appliqué aux services taxables. Je vais me pencher sur cette question préliminaire avant d'aborder la taxation des services et débours à taxer.
Barème des dépens
[5]
Au paragraphe 3 des observations des défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate écrit ce qui suit:
[traduction] Les défendeurs demandent que leur soient accordés les dépens calculés selon le haut de la fourchette de la colonne III du tarif, car l'audition de la demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par les demandeurs, qui comprend l'audition de plusieurs requêtes qui devaient être entendues et tranchées dans le cadre de l'audition de la demande de contrôle judiciaire (la demande), a été excessivement longue et complexe. Il s'agissait d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire hors du commun.
Puis, au paragraphe 171, l'avocate des défendeurs fait valoir que les facteurs énoncés au paragraphe 400(3) des
Règles des Cours fédérales
justifient que les dépens qui leur sont adjugés soient calculés selon le maximum prévu pour la colonne III du tarif B.
[6]
En réponse, au paragraphe 7 du mémoire des demandeurs sur le montant des dépens (le mémoire des demandeurs), l'avocat déclare ce qui suit:
[traduction] Compte tenu des arguments avancés en l'occurrence, il était loisible au juge Campbell d'adjuger les dépens en fonction du haut de la fourchette prévue à la colonne III. Or, le juge Campbell ne l'a pas fait. Cela étant, et malgré les arguments que réitèrent ici les défendeurs, les demandeurs font valoir que pour tout article du tarif, à moins qu'il y ait des raisons d'en décider autrement, c'est le milieu de la fourchette de la colonne III qui s'applique par défaut. Accepter l'argument des défendeurs, et accorder, pour tous les articles du barème, les dépens taxables sur la base du maximum prévu à la colonne III, aurait pour effet d'usurper la réponse précise que le juge Campbell a apportée à ces mêmes arguments. (Selon lui, [traduction] « il n'y avait aucune raison que les dépens adjugés le soient autrement que selon la colonne III du tarif B ».) Ce serait comme si l'on se prononçait par ordonnance sur la question des dépens, ce qui n'entre pas dans les compétences d'un officier taxateur.
À l'appui de cet argument, l'avocat des demandeurs renvoie au paragraphe 20 du
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[7]
Au paragraphe 6 des observations présentées en réponse par les défendeurs, l'avocate soutient ce qui suit:
[traduction] Lorsque le juge Campbell a adjugé les dépens selon la colonne III, il n'a fait aucun commentaire et n'a donné aucune directive quant à la position à retenir dans la fourchette de la colonne B, s'en remettant à bon droit pour cela à l'officier taxateur. C'est pourquoi il y a lieu de rejeter l'argument des demandeurs selon lequel les défendeurs n'ont droit, pour aucun article du barème, à des dépens taxés selon l'échelon le haut de la fourchette de la colonne III.
[8]
L'article 407 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
dispose:
Sauf ordonnance contraire de la Cour, les dépens partie-partie sont taxés en conformité avec la colonne III du tableau du tarif B.
Je ne vois rien dans le libellé de l'article 407 qui limite au milieu de la fourchette de la colonne III la taxation des services qui sont réclamés.
[9]
Au dernier paragraphe de l'ordonnance rendue à la suite des plaidoiries concernant les dépens (l'ordonnance relative aux dépens), en date du 19 novembre 2012, la Cour a déclaré ceci:
[traduction] L'action intentée par les demandeurs en application de la
Charte
était effectivement complexe et les parties, comme la Cour, ont dû y consacrer beaucoup de temps, mais il n'existe aucune raison d'adjuger les dépens autrement que selon la colonne III du tarif B des
Règles des Cours fédérales
, et je rends une ordonnance en ce sens.
[10]
Je conviens avec l'avocat des demandeurs que l'ordonnance de la Cour ne précise pas que les dépens sont à taxer selon le haut de la fourchette de la colonne III, mais je conviens également avec l'avocate des défendeurs que l'ordonnance ne limite pas au point médian de la colonne III les dépens adjugés.
[11]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la Cour cite la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> où la Cour a déclaré ceci: « Selon l'article 407 des Règles, ces dépens sont
généralement taxés selon le point médian de la colonne III du tarif B
, avec certains autres honoraires et débours » (Non souligné dans l'original). Bien que, selon la Cour, les dépens soient « généralement taxés selon le point médian », j'estime que lorsque les frais réclamés sortent de l'habituel, je n'ai pas à m'en tenir au point médian de la colonne III.
[12]
Sur ce point, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> la Cour d'appel fédérale a écrit:
Agissant sous l'autorité de la règle 405, l'officier taxateur n'avait d'autre choix que celui d'appliquer la colonne III du tableau du tarif B comme le prescrit la règle 407. En taxant et en allouant les dépens
selon les limites prévues à la règle 407
et dans le cadre du jugement rendu dans le dossier A-598-99, elle pouvait, en vertu de la règle 409,
tenir compte, dans l'attribution des unités permises, des facteurs prévus à la règle 400(3)
[...] (Non souligné dans l'original).
En affirmant que, dans l'allocation des unités qu'autorise l'article 407 des Règles, l'officier taxateur peut tenir compte des facteurs prévus au paragraphe 400(3) des Règles, la Cour laisse clairement entendre qu'en l'absence d'une directive de la Cour, l'officier taxateur a la compétence voulue pour décider du nombre d'unités à accorder dans la fourchette prévue à la colonne III.
[13]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> la Cour a déclaré ce qui suit:
Le Tarif prévoit une indemnisation partielle en établissant une liste, non nécessairement exhaustive, de services distincts que les avocats rendent pendant un litige. Les Règles visent à faire ressortir les questions pertinentes et à écarter celles qui ne le sont pas. Par exemple, les étapes des actes de procédures et de la communication de la preuve peuvent impliquer des opérations complexes de définition et de synthèse, simplifiant ainsi les questions à instruire. Ainsi, chaque article est taxable en fonction de ses propres circonstances et il n'est pas nécessaire d'utiliser le même nombre d'unités pour chaque service rendu. Si les services s'évaluent en fonction d'un nombre d'heures, le même nombre d'unités ne doit pas nécessairement être accordé pour chaque heure, particulièrement si les caractéristiques de l'audience ont varié pendant sa durée. Dans le présent mémoire de frais, le nombre minimal d'unités pour l'article 5 et le nombre maximal d'unités pour l'article 6 sont des résultats possibles. Pour quelques articles à la fourchette peu étendue, comme l'article 14, il faut établir des distinctions générales relativement au choix de la position retenue dans la fourchette.
[14]
Comme la Cour n'a rendu aucune directive précise quant à la position dans la fourchette de la colonne III, je conclu que je peux déterminer, à titre d'officier taxateur, le nombre d'unités à attribuer pour chaque service à taxer dans la fourchette tout entière de cette colonne, tout en reconnaissant qu'en général les services sont taxés au point médian, sauf dans les cas où les circonstances prescrivent que des dépens particuliers doivent être taxés à un niveau supérieur ou inférieur.
Les services à taxer
[15]
Étant parvenu à cette conclusion, je vais maintenant procéder à la taxation des divers articles de frais en tenant compte, au besoin, des facteurs énumérés au paragraphe 400(3) des
Règles des Cours fédérales
.
[16]
En ce qui concerne l'article 2, préparation et dépôt de toutes les défenses, réponses, demandes reconventionnelles ou dossiers et documents des intimés, l'avocate des défendeurs réclame sept unités au titre de la préparation du dossier des défendeurs, déposé le 6 octobre 2009.
[17]
Au paragraphe 10 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocate des défendeurs précise que les demandeurs ne s'opposent pas à ce que l'article 2 soit accordé selon le point médian de la colonne III.
[18]
Lors de la préparation de leur dossier de demande, les défendeurs ont dû répondre aux arguments avancés par les demandeurs. J'ai examiné le dossier de demande présenté par les défendeurs, ainsi que leurs affidavits et leur mémoire des faits et du droit et, si je tiens compte du temps qu'a exigé leur préparation et des questions soulevées par les demandeurs, auxquelles les défendeurs ont dû répondre, j'estime que les frais dont les défendeurs font état au titre de l'article 2 sont entièrement raisonnables. Par conséquent, les sept unités réclamées au titre de l'article 2 sont accordées.
[19]
Au titre de l'article 5, préparation et dépôt d'une requête contestée, y compris les documents et les réponses s'y rapportant, les défendeurs ont présenté cinq demandes de sept unités chacune. Ces demandes concernent la requête des défendeurs sollicitant une ordonnance radiant de la demande les noms monsieur Untel et madame Untelle (document no 12 du dossier de requête), la requête en recevabilité déposée par les demandeurs (document no 52 du dossier de requête), la requête des défendeurs sollicitant une ordonnance radiant en tout ou en partie les affidavits déposés par les demandeurs à l'appui de leur demande (document no 83 du dossier de requête), la requête des demandeurs sollicitant une ordonnance radiant divers paragraphes de divers affidavits déposés par les défendeurs (document no 99 du dossier de requête) et, en réponse à une demande de la Cour, les observations des défendeurs sur la question des dépens. Je vais me pencher tour à tour sur chacune de ces requêtes.
[20]
En ce qui concerne la demande présentée au titre de l'article 5 visant le document no 12 du dossier de requête, à partir du paragraphe 23 des observations déposées par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate fait valoir que le 12 décembre 2003, les demandeurs ont déposé, au nom de la demanderesse Madame Unetelle, un avis de désistement et que, le 19 mars 2004, les demandeurs ont déposé un avis de requête sollicitant une ordonnance les autorisant à déposer un avis de demande modifié; ils se désistaient de leur demande de contrôle judiciaire visant les décisions énumérées aux alinéas b), d) et e) de l'avis de demande déposé le 28 mai 2003. Puis, au paragraphe 34 des observations déposées par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate écrit ce qui suit:
[traduction] En effet, les demandeurs ont admis la plupart des arguments avancés par le PGC dans la requête en radiation déposée en 2003 en déposant, au nom de Madame Unetelle, un avis de désistement et leur première requête en modification, requête par laquelle ils se désistaient de leur demande de contrôle judiciaire des présumées décisions énumérées aux alinéas b), d) et e) de leur demande initiale. Cela étant, le PGC demande que lui soient adjugés les dépens de sa requête en radiation déposée en 2003, conformément aux articles 402 et 410 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
.
À l'appui de cet argument, les défendeurs citent les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[21]
À partir du paragraphe 11 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat soutient que l'article 401 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
permet à la Cour d'adjuger les dépens afférents à une requête. Il fait ensuite valoir qu'en l'absence d'une ordonnance portant expressément sur les dépens, ceux-ci ne peuvent pas être adjugés. Puis, au paragraphe 17, l'avocat fait valoir que l'ordonnance en date du 4 novembre 2008, concernant le document no 12, ne dit rien au sujet des dépens. En ce qui concerne les articles 402 et 410 des Règles, à partir du paragraphe 19 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat écrit ceci:
[traduction]
19. L'article 402 s'applique en cas de désistement ou d'abandon. Or, les demandeurs ne se sont pas désistés de leur demande, et n'ont pas non plus abandonné une requête. Cet article des Règles ne s'applique par conséquent pas. Ajoutons que lorsqu'ils ont déposé leur demande, les demandeurs pensaient que toutes les cargaisons indiquées comme ayant été saisies avaient effectivement été saisies. La remise ultérieure de certaines des cargaisons et, par conséquent, la modification qui a été raisonnablement apportée à la demande afin de tenir compte de cela, ne confèrent pas le droit de se voir adjuger les dépens en vertu de l'article 402 des Règles, situation analogue à celle de l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La jurisprudence citée par les défendeurs ne s'applique pas en l'espèce.
20. L'article 410 des Règles ne s'applique qu'à une modification qui est apportée à un acte de procédure « sans autorisation ». Comme le soulignent les défendeurs, une requête en modification a été présentée et accueillie par le juge Campbell sans adjudication des dépens [...] L'article 410 des Règles ne s'applique pas en l'occurrence parce que la modification a été apportée avec l'autorisation de la Cour et qu'aucune ordonnance n'ayant été rendue au sujet des dépens.
[22]
Au paragraphe 22 des observations présentées en réponse par les défendeurs, l'avocate renvoie aux paragraphes 23 à 34 des observations qu'ils ont déposées le 7 juin 2013, sans avancer d'autres arguments.
[23]
J'ai examiné le document no 12 du dossier de requête, et j'estime que le désistement des demandeurs et leur requête subséquente en modification de leur avis de demande n'ont pas réglé entièrement la question de la requête. Cela ressort de l'ordonnance du 4 novembre 2008, qui, ainsi que je l'ai confirmé, concerne le document no 12 du dossier de requête des défendeurs. Ainsi que le soutiennent les demandeurs, l'ordonnance de la Cour portant radiation du nom de monsieur Untel de l'intitulé de la cause ne dit pas un mot au sujet des dépens. Cela étant, je conclus que les défendeurs n'ont pas droit aux dépens de la requête et qu'il n'est pas nécessaire d'examiner les arguments avancés par les défendeurs au sujet des articles 402 et 410 des Règles. Par conséquent, les frais dont ils demandent le remboursement au titre de l'article 5 pour le dossier de requête déposé le 2 septembre 2003 sont refusés.
[24]
Pour ce qui est des frais que les défendeurs réclament au titre de l'article 5 concernant le document no 52 du dossier de requête, il s'agit du dossier de requête déposé par les défendeurs le 30 avril 2008; il ne contient qu'un seul volume. À partir du paragraphe 40 des observations déposées par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate fait valoir que les demandeurs ont sollicité l'autorisation de modifier leur demande modifiée pour y ajouter 45 nouveaux paragraphes. Elle rappelle que la requête devait être entendue le 9 mai 2008, mais que l'audience a été reportée aux 13 et 14 novembre 2008, à Calgary. Puis, au paragraphe 45 des observations des défendeurs sur la question des dépens, elle écrit ceci:
[traduction] Ajoutons que le juge Campbell avait décidé que la requête en recevabilité déposée en 2008 par les demandeurs serait tranchée dans le cadre de l'audition de la demande de contrôle judiciaire (c.-à-d., que la question de la recevabilité des notes concernant les appels 1-800, les témoignages de Jarvis et de Brosseau et la dénonciation faite sous serment dans le cadre de la procédure criminelle engagée auparavant serait réglée lors d'un voir dire dans le cadre de l'audition de la demande).
L'avocate cite à l'appui les directives écrites de la Cour, en date du 13 novembre 2008. Puis, à l'alinéa 176
c
) des observations déposées par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate fait valoir que le procureur général demande que lui soient adjugés des dépens, étant donné qu'il avait été décidé que la requête serait entendue dans le cadre de la demande de contrôle judiciaire principale, et que, pour les motifs exposés par la Cour, la requête des demandeurs a été rejetée.
[25]
Au paragraphe 12 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat soutient que lorsqu'une requête est entendue dans le cadre d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire et que l'ordonnance rendue à l'issue du contrôle judiciaire ne dit rien au sujet des dépens de la requête, il faut conclure que les dépens de la requête n'ont pas été adjugés. À l'appui de cet argument, l'avocat des demandeurs cite les paragraphes 8 à 11 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Puis, au paragraphe 25 du mémoire des demandeurs, il présente l'argumentation suivante:
[traduction] Article B.5 Dossier de requête déposé le 30 avril 2008 (doc. no 58 du dossier de la Cour) en réponse à la requête des demandeurs (doc. no 52 du dossier de la Cour). Les défendeurs soutiennent [...] qu'ils demandent que les dépens de la requête leur soient adjugés étant donné « que la requête faisait partie de la demande de contrôle judiciaire principale, qu'il a été décidé qu'elle serait entendue dans le cadre de celle-ci et que, dans ses motifs, la Cour a rejeté la requête en recevabilité déposée par les demandeurs ». L'affirmation des défendeurs est erronée, car il a été en grande partie fait droit à la requête. Le premier point de la requête a été pour l'essentiel accueilli, le 9 mai 2008, lorsque la requête a été entendue, et un avis de demande modifié a été déposé par la suite. Les points 2 et 3 ont été ajoutés par prudence et les affidavits en cause ont été déposés (la réparation sollicitée). Les points 4 et 6 ne sont devenus théoriques qu'après le contre-interrogatoire de Sandra Jarvis (un témoignage analogue au témoignage dont il est fait mention au point 4, a été rendu lors du contre-interrogatoire, et la dénonciation dont il est fait état au point 6 a été jugée recevable en tant que pièce à l'appui du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Jarvis). Le point 6 a été admis en preuve par le juge Campbell. Le point 3 n'est devenu superflu qu'après que les défendeurs eurent reconnu qu'ils ne s'étaient jamais souciés de la sécurité. Le point 7 a été concédé à l'audience (les notes concernant la ligne d'écoute 1-800 ont été admises en preuve). Quoi qu'il en soit, les dépens de la requête n'ont pas été adjugés, et il importe donc peu qu'il ait été en partie fait droit à la requête. Comme la Cour n'ayant pas rendu d'ordonnance à ce sujet, il n'y a pas eu d'adjudication des dépens des requêtes en question.
[26]
Au paragraphe 25 des observations déposées en réponse par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate contredit les demandeurs lorsque ceux-ci affirment qu'il [traduction] « a été en grande partie fait droit » à la requête, et renvoie au paragraphe 77 des observations déposées par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, où il est dit:
[traduction] Pour ce qui est de la requête en recevabilité déposée par les demandeurs en 2008, la Cour a jugé que le contenu des « notes concernant la ligne d'écoute 1-800 » est dénué de pertinence et a refusé d'admettre la véracité de leur contenu. En ce qui concerne le « témoignage rendu à l'audience par M. Miles Brosseau [...] visant à démontrer que Santé Canada n'avait pas pris en compte les éventuelles conséquences sanitaires de la saisie effectuée en avril 2003 avant de procéder à cette saisie », la Cour a jugé que leur requête était superflue étant donné que les défendeurs ne contestaient pas ce fait. Sur ce point, la Cour a rejeté la requête en recevabilité présentée en 2008 par les demandeurs.
[27]
Selon l'avocate, les défendeurs sollicitent les dépens puisque la Cour avait ordonné que la requête soit entendue dans le cadre de la demande de contrôle judiciaire principale, et que la requête a été rejetée. Dans ces circonstances, il faudrait, avant que je puisse taxer les dépens de la requête en recevabilité déposée par les demandeurs (document no 52 du dossier de requête), que la Cour adjuge expressément par ordonnance les dépens de la requête. Sur ce point, conformément à ce qui a été décidé dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, je constate que, dans son ordonnance rendue à la suite des plaidoiries concernant les dépens en date du 19 novembre 2012, la Cour n'a pas exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour adjuger les dépens de cette requête, ou de toute autre requête. À la page 4 de son ordonnance, la Cour déclare: [traduction] « En conséquence, j'adjuge aux défendeurs
les dépens de la demande
» (non souligné dans l'original). La Cour a pris soin d'adjuger les dépens de la demande. En précisant qu'il s'agissait bien des dépens de la demande, la Cour a, selon moi, limité l'adjudication des dépens à la demande de contrôle judiciaire, indiquant clairement par là qu'il n'y aurait aucune adjudication des dépens pour ce qui est des requêtes entendues lors de l'audition de la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Par conséquent, les frais réclamés par les défendeurs au titre de l'article 5 pour ce qui est du document no 52 du dossier de requête sont refusés.
[28]
Les défendeurs demandent qu'on leur accorde sept unités pour les dossiers de requête déposés le 8 septembre 2009 et le 6 octobre 2009. Ces dossiers concernent les requêtes en radiation déposées par les défendeurs ainsi que par les demandeurs, respectivement le document no 83 du dossier de requête et le document no 99 du dossier de requête. Aux termes de l'ordonnance en date du 11 mai 2009, ces deux requêtes devaient être présentées le 2 novembre 2009 afin d'être entendues au début de l'audition de la demande de contrôle judiciaire. À l'audience de taxation des dépens ainsi que dans leurs observations écrites, les deux parties ont présenté des observations détaillées concernant ces requêtes. Les demandeurs font essentiellement valoir l'absence d'ordonnance adjugeant les dépens des requêtes, soutenant qu'avant que les dépens de ces requêtes puissent être taxés, il fallait que la Cour se prononce de manière précise sur leur adjudication. Les défendeurs font pour leur part valoir qu'il s'agissait en l'occurrence d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire complexe, dans le cadre de laquelle la Cour a décidé que les requêtes seraient entendues le 2 novembre 2009 lors de l'audition de la demande de contrôle judiciaire, et que ces requêtes en recevabilité de la preuve faisaient donc partie de la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Selon l'avocate des défendeurs, la Cour, lorsqu'elle a adjugé les dépens, a envisagé l'audience dans son intégralité, y compris, donc, l'audition des requêtes.
[29]
Il n'est, selon moi, pas nécessaire d'examiner longuement les arguments avancés par les parties au sujet des requêtes en radiation. Après examen des motifs de l'ordonnance et de l'ordonnance en date du 20 janvier 2010, j'estime que la Cour a examiné, aux paragraphes 75 à 85, les requêtes en radiation de certains passages des affidavits versés au dossier présentées par les parties. Au paragraphe 85, la Cour conclut en disant que « la preuve déclarée non pertinente est inadmissible ». Dans sa décision sur les requêtes en radiation, la Cour passe sous silence l'adjudication des dépens. Cela étant, la conclusion à laquelle je suis parvenu au paragraphe 25 des présents motifs, c'est-à-dire que l'adjudication des dépens décidée par la Cour ne concerne que la demande de contrôle judiciaire, s'applique également à ces requêtes. Compte tenu, donc, de la décision à laquelle je suis parvenu au paragraphe 27, les frais que les défendeurs réclament au titre de l'article 5 pour le dossier de requête déposé le 8 septembre 2009 et les frais qu'ils réclament au titre de l'article 5 pour le dossier de requête déposé le 6 octobre 2009 sont refusés.
[30]
Les défendeurs demandent que leur soient accordées sept unités au titre de l'article 5 pour le dossier de requête déposé le 17 septembre 2012, qui visait l'obtention d'une ordonnance leur adjugeant les dépens. Au paragraphe 94 des observations déposées par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate soutient que la Cour [traduction] « avait décidé que la question du droit aux dépens serait jugée sur dossier par voie de requête écrite ». Le seul argument avancé par les demandeurs qui contestent cette réclamation est que la Cour n'a rendu aucune ordonnance adjugeant les dépens.
[31]
J'ai examiné le dossier de la Cour et constaté que, lors de la conférence de gestion de l'instance tenue le 22 mai 2012, la Cour a donné comme directive au procureur général du Canada de lui faire parvenir [traduction] « un mémoire des arguments exposant sa demande au sujet des dépens » le 17 septembre 2012 au plus tard. Bien que, dans cette directive, la Cour emploie le mot demande, la directive ne contient rien susceptible d'indiquer aux défendeurs qu'il leur fallait déposer un dossier de requête. Cela devait être clair aux yeux des défendeurs car, le 17 septembre 2012, ils ont déposé non pas un dossier de requête, mais un document intitulé [traduction] « Mémoire des défendeurs quant à leur droit de se voir adjuger les dépens ». Cela étant, j'estime qu'ils ne peuvent pas prétendre avoir droit à des dépens au titre de l'article 5 étant donné qu'ils n'ont pas présenté de requête. Subsidiairement, si la Cour entendait considérer comme une requête la demande déposée par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'ordonnance rendue à la suite des plaidoiries concernant les dépens, en date du 19 novembre 2012, ne prévoit expressément aucune adjudication des dépens à l'égard d'une requête en adjudication des dépens. Par conséquent, les frais que les défendeurs réclament au titre de l'article 5, pour leur mémoire sur leur droit à se voir adjuger les dépens, déposé le 17 septembre 2012, sont refusés.
[32]
Les défendeurs ont également soumis une demande au titre de l'article 15, préparation et dépôt d'un plaidoyer écrit, à la demande ou avec la permission de la Cour, pour leur mémoire sur leur droit à se voir adjuger les dépens. Au paragraphe 188 des observations déposées par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate fait valoir que ces observations concernent le droit des défendeurs à se voir adjuger les dépens ainsi que la question de savoir si la question des dépens devrait effectivement être tranchée sur la base d'une requête écrite.
[33]
En réponse, l'avocat des demandeurs avance que l'article 15 figure sous la rubrique E « Instruction ou audience » et qu'il ne s'agit donc aucunement de la préparation d'une requête. Il fait en outre valoir que la réclamation présentée à ce titre est en fait un dédoublement de la demande de frais puisque les défendeurs ont déjà présenté une réclamation au titre de l'article 5 et qu'il ne saurait y avoir adjudication des dépens étant donné que les dépens de la requête n'ont pas été adjugés.
[34]
Au paragraphe 50 de la réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate affirme que la Cour avait demandé aux parties de déposer des observations sur leur droit à se voir adjuger les dépens et que, compte tenu des documents ainsi déposés, c'est à bon droit que les défendeurs réclament ces frais qui devraient, par conséquent, leur être accordés.
[35]
La réclamation des défendeurs au titre de l'article 5 pour la préparation de leur mémoire de dépens a été rejetée au paragraphe 31 des présents motifs. Ainsi que nous l'avons vu, le mémoire de dépens des défendeurs a été déposé le 17 septembre 2012, conformément à une directive de la Cour. La Cour a déjà eu l'occasion de décider que pour que les dépens soient accordés au titre de l'article 15, il faut que, par une directive, la Cour ait préalablement demandé, ou autorisé le dépôt d'observations écrites (voir: League for  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Comme j'ai conclu que la réclamation des défendeurs au titre de l'article 5 ne peut pas être accueillie, mais c'est selon moi à bon droit qu'ils font une réclamation au titre de l'article 15, étant donné que le mémoire a été déposé en réponse à une directive de la Cour en date du 22 mai 2012. Quant au nombre d'unités pouvant être accordées, je considère comme excessif les sept unités proposées par les défendeurs. Étant donné que le mémoire concernait non pas les questions de fond dont était saisie la Cour, mais le droit d'une partie à se voir adjuger les dépens, il me semble raisonnable d'accorder cinq unités. Cinq unités sont donc accordées pour les frais réclamés au titre de l'article 15.
[36]
Les défendeurs ont réclamé 10 unités (3,33 heures x 3 unités) au titre de l'article 6 pour leur comparution lors de la requête entendue le 9 mai 2008. L'audition portait sur la requête en recevabilité présentée par les demandeurs (document no 52 du dossier de requête). Compte tenu de mes décisions exposées au paragraphe 27 des présents motifs, j'estime que les défendeurs n'ont pas droit aux dépens de cette requête. Par conséquent, les frais que les défendeurs réclament au titre de l'article 6 sont refusés.
[37]
Les défendeurs présentent 17 réclamations au titre des articles 8 et 9 respectivement, pour la préparation et le contre-interrogatoire des auteurs des affidavits produits dans le cadre de la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Les défendeurs demandent que leur soient accordées cinq unités pour chaque réclamation présentée au titre de l'article 8, et trois unités par heure pour chaque réclamation présentée au titre de l'article 9.
[38]
Les quatre premières réclamations présentées au titre de ces deux articles concernent les contre-interrogatoires de Sandra Jarvis, Miles Brosseau, Rod Neske et Dennis Shelley, qui ont eu lieu en novembre et décembre 2003. Au paragraphe 24 des observations déposées par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate affirme que les affidavits en question ont été déposés à l'appui de leur requête en radiation (document no 12 du dossier de requête). Puis, au paragraphe 51, les défendeurs font valoir qu'ils avaient fait savoir à l'avance qu'ils entendaient se fonder, dans le cadre de la demande de contrôle judiciaire, sur sept affidavits dont ceux de Sandra Jarvis et Rod Neske, susmentionnés. À l'audience de taxation, l'avocate des défendeurs a fait valoir que les demandeurs ont inclus dans leur dossier de demande la transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Sandra Jarvis et de Rod Neske.
[39]
Au paragraphe 34 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat affirme ceci:
[traduction] Les quatre premières préparations réclamées [...] concernent toutes les interrogatoires menés en 2003, dans le cadre d'une requête présentée par les défendeurs. Comme les dépens de cette requête n'ont pas été adjugés, les frais en question ne devraient pas être accordés. Il importe peu que les demandeurs aient déposé l'une de ces transcriptions aux fins de la demande de contrôle judiciaire.
À l'audience de taxation, l'avocat des demandeurs a fait valoir que, bien que certaines parties de la transcription des interrogatoires de Sandra Jarvis et de Rod Neske aient été en rapport avec la demande de contrôle judiciaire et aient figuré dans le dossier des demandeurs, le contre-interrogatoire a été mené aux fins de la requête en radiation présentée par les défendeurs.
[40]
À partir du paragraphe 28 des observations déposées en réponse par les défendeurs sur la question des dépens, l'avocate soutient ce qui suit:
[traduction]
i. Le PGC fait valoir que les interrogatoires de Sandra Jarvis, Miles Brosseau, Rod Neske et Dennis Shelley ont été faits dans le cadre de la requête en radiation déposée en septembre 2003 par les défendeurs à l'égard de laquelle des dépens sont demandés conformément aux articles 402 et 410 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
. [...]
ii. Subsidiairement, des dépens devraient être accordés pour la préparation du contre-interrogatoire relatif à l'affidavit de Rod Neske en 2003, étant donné que les demandeurs avaient, dans le cadre de la demande de contrôle judiciaire, inclus ce contre-interrogatoire dans leur dossier. Selon le PGC, il ne devrait pas, lors de l'audition de la demande de contrôle judiciaire, être permis aux demandeurs de se servir de la transcription d'un interrogatoire pour étayer leurs arguments, alors qu'ils tentent d'en éviter les dépens en affirmant que la transcription a été obtenue dans le cadre d'une requête précédente. Une telle décision permettrait aux demandeurs d'utiliser une transcription sans en subir les frais ou en assumer les risques.
À l'audience de taxation, l'avocate des défendeurs a fait valoir que si les dépens de la requête en radiation ne leur sont pas accordés, les frais du contre-interrogatoire de Sandra Jarvis et de Rod Neske devraient leur être accordés comme faisant partie du contrôle judiciaire.
[41]
Les parties conviennent que ces contre-interrogatoires faisaient partie de la requête en radiation présentée par les défendeurs (document no 12 du dossier de requête). Au paragraphe 29 des présents motifs, j'ai conclu que les défendeurs n'ont pas droit aux dépens de la requête en radiation. Par conséquent, les frais réclamés au titre des articles 8 et 9 pour le contre-interrogatoire de Miles Brosseau et de Dennis Shelley ne sont pas accordés, étant donné qu'ils concernent la requête en radiation. Pour ce qui est des contre-interrogatoires de Sandra Jarvis et de Rod Neske, les parties conviennent que les défendeurs se sont fondés sur leurs affidavits respectifs lors du contrôle judiciaire et que les transcriptions des contre-interrogatoires menés en 2003 ont été versées au dossier des demandeurs. Contrairement à ce qu'affirment les défendeurs, qui soutiennent que les demandeurs ne devraient pas pouvoir éviter d'avoir à payer les dépens en faisant valoir que les contre-interrogatoires ont été menés aux fins d'une précédente requête, j'estime que la réclamation présentée au titre de l'article 8 pour les contre-interrogatoires de Sandra Jarvis et de Rod Neske ne devrait pas être accordée. Les défendeurs n'ont produit aucune preuve de la date à laquelle ils auraient notifié aux demandeurs leur intention de se fonder sur les affidavits de Sandra Jarvis et de Rod Neske lors du contrôle judiciaire. Cela étant, les demandeurs n'auraient eu aucune raison de contre-interroger les déposants sur un sujet autre que la requête. À cet égard, les défendeurs ont fait état des frais relatifs aux contre-interrogatoires ultérieurs de Sandra Jarvis et de Rod Neske, menés respectivement le 3 août 2009 et le 23 juin 2009 et, aux paragraphes 35 et 39 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocate précise que les demandeurs ne soulèvent aucune objection à l'égard des deuxièmes interrogatoires étant donné que ces interrogatoires visaient à recueillir des preuves à produire lors de l'audience de contrôle judiciaire, et ne concernaient pas la requête.
[42]
Il semblerait, rétrospectivement, que les défendeurs devraient se voir accorder leurs frais au titre des articles 8 et 9 pour les contre-interrogatoires de Sandra Jarvis et Rod Neske qui ont eu lieu en 2003, étant donné que les demandeurs en ont inclus la transcription dans leur dossier de demande. Toutefois, la Cour a statué que la taxation des dépens ne doit pas être basée sur un examen rétrospectif (voir:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Ainsi, j'estime que le fait que les défendeurs aient décidé, ultérieurement, qu'il leur était nécessaire d'inclure la transcription de ces contre-interrogatoires dans leur dossier, n'est d'aucune pertinence. Ajoutons que, dans cette optique, il n'est guère raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que les demandeurs remboursent aux défendeurs les frais d'une requête dont les dépens n'ont pas été adjugés. Ainsi, les réclamations formulées par les défendeurs au titre des articles 8 et 9 pour les contre-interrogatoires de Sandra Jarvis et Rod Neske en 2003 sont refusées.
[43]
Pour ce qui est des autres réclamations formulées au titre des articles 8 et 9, le groupe suivant consiste de 11 demandes de frais liés aux contre-interrogatoires du Dr Kaplan, du Dr Popper, d'Anthony Stephan, de David Hardy, de Rod Neske, du Dr Vu, du Dr Mueller, du Dr Mithani, de M. Robin Marles, de Sandra Jarvis et de Bruce Dale. Au paragraphe 35 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat fait valoir que les demandeurs ont consenti à ce que les 11 réclamations présentées au titre de l'article 8 soient taxées selon le milieu de la fourchette de la colonne III. Puis, au paragraphe 39, les demandeurs déclarent ce qui suit:
[traduction] Compte tenu des suspensions d'audience [...] les demandeurs ne s'opposent pas aux 11 réclamations suivantes présentées au titre de l'article 9. [...] Les demandeurs consentent à ces 11 réclamations au taux d'une unité par heure. Les trois unités par heure demandées par les défendeurs sont excessives dans une procédure telle que celle-ci.
Puis, l'avocat soutient que les pauses repas et les suspensions d'audience, pendant lesquelles les avocats ne s'occupent guère du dossier, ne sont pas remboursables au titre de l'article 9. Il cite, à l'appui de cet argument, les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 37,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 45, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Puis, à la page 11 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat fait valoir qu'en ce qui concerne les contre-interrogatoires du Dr Kapan, du Dr Popper, de M. Hardy, de M. Neske, du Dr Vu et du Dr Mueller, le nombre d'heures qui est demandé devrait être réduit afin de tenir compte, chaque jour, de la période du repas.
[44]
Les défendeurs n'ont présenté aucun contre-argument en ce qui concerne l'article 8. Pour ce qui est de l'article 9, en revanche, à l'audience de taxation, l'avocate des défendeurs a fait valoir, au sujet de la présence des avocats lors du contre-interrogatoire des déposants des défendeurs, qu'il y avait sans doute eu une pause repas. En ce qui concerne, cependant, le contre-interrogatoire des déposants des demandeurs, l'avocate des défendeurs a soutenu que la pause avait été consacrée à des repas de travail. Puis, au paragraphe 32 des observations présentées en réponse par les défendeurs, elle rappelle ceci:
[traduction] [...] L'avocate des défendeurs a interrogé trois des experts-témoins des demandeurs sur des questions relevant de domaines hautement techniques, notamment, à l'égard des affidavits du Dr Kaplan, concernant plusieurs études qui exigeaient une longue préparation pour que le témoin puisse être contre-interrogé efficacement.
Concernant le nombre d'unités demandé au titre de l'article 9, l'avocate des défendeurs fait valoir que les affidavits de M. Hardy et de M. Stephan étaient longs et denses, et qu'ils traitaient de nombreuses questions litigieuses. Puis, au paragraphe 34 de leurs observations en réponse, les défendeurs soutiennent ce qui suit:
[traduction] C'est pour cela que le PGC fait valoir en toute déférence que la prétention des demandeurs, selon laquelle « il serait excessif dans ce type de procédure » d'accorder trois unités, est totalement erronée. L'examen de la nature et de la teneur des affidavits en question permet de constater qu'il s'agit d'un domaine d'une grande complexité.
[45]
Pour ce qui est maintenant de l'article 8, les défendeurs n'ont produit aucun élément de preuve justifiant que leurs frais leur soient accordés selon le haut de la fourchette de la colonne III. J'estime cependant, malgré le manque de preuves, que les défendeurs ont sans doute eu à consacrer au contre-interrogatoire des déposants des demandeurs un temps sensiblement plus long que celui qu'ont consacré les demandeurs à la préparation du contre-interrogatoire des déposants des défendeurs. Dans ces circonstances, et vu la nature des questions que soulevait la présente affaire, quatre unités seront accordées au titre de l'article 8 pour le contre-interrogatoire du Dr Kaplan, du Dr Popper, de M. Stephan, de M. Hardy et de M. Dales, et trois unités pour les contre-interrogatoires de M. Neske, du Dr Vu, du Dr Mueller, du Dr Mithani, du Dr Marles et de Mme Jarvis, soit, au total 38 unités.
[46]
Pour ce qui est maintenant de l'article 9, et de la question des pauses repas, étant donné que les défendeurs reconnaissent que le contre-interrogatoire des défendeurs aura été suspendu à l'heure du repas, le nombre d'heures réclamé au titre du contre-interrogatoire de M. Neske, du Dr Vu et du Dr Mueller sera réduit d'une heure par journée de contre-interrogatoire. En ce qui concerne les déposants des demandeurs, et bien que les défendeurs aient fait valoir que les pauses étaient consacrées à des repas de travail, j'estime qu'au cours de chaque pause les avocats ont quand même dû consacrer un certain temps à leur repas ainsi qu'à d'autres fonctions n'ayant aucun rapport avec l'instance. Par conséquent, pour ce qui est du contre-interrogatoire du Dr Kaplan, du Dr Popper et de M. Hardy, le nombre d'heures réclamé sera réduit de 30 minutes par journée de contre-interrogatoire. Les contre-interrogatoires de M. Stephan, du Dr Mithani, du Dr Marles, de Mme Jarvis et de M. Dales n'ont pas repris après l'heure du repas, et les frais invoqués à leur égard n'ont donc pas été rajustés.
[47]
En ce qui concerne, maintenant, le nombre d'unités réclamé par heure au titre de l'article 9, les demandeurs n'ont pas fourni de preuves ou d'éclaircissement pour expliquer pourquoi il serait excessif d'accorder trois unités par heure. Quant aux défendeurs, ils n'ont fourni aucune preuve ou raison expliquant pourquoi ils devraient se voir accorder, selon le haut de la fourchette de la colonne III, les heures consacrées au contre-interrogatoire de leurs déposants. Ils se contentent de commentaires très brefs au sujet des affidavits du Dr Kaplan, de M. Hardy et de M. Stephan sur lesquels se fondaient les demandeurs. Cela étant, et vu la nature des questions soulevées dans le cadre de l'instance, j'accorde, au titre des contre-interrogatoires du Dr Kaplan, du Dr Popper, de M. Stephan, de M. Hardy, de M. Neske, du Dr Vu, du Dr Mueller, du Dr Mithani, du Dr Marles, de Mme Jarvis et de M. Dale, deux unités par heure pour le nombre d'heures rajusté au paragraphe 46. Ainsi, pour le contre-interrogatoire des personnes mentionnées ci-dessus, un total de 108 unités est accordé au titre de l'article 9.
[48]
Il y a ensuite les réclamations formulées au titre des articles 8 et 9 pour le contre-interrogatoire du Dr Silverstone. Après examen de la documentation produite par les parties, j'estime nécessaire d'examiner dans leur ensemble les honoraires et débours occasionnés par le témoignage du Dr Silverstone. C'est pourquoi j'entends examiner les réclamations formulées par les défendeurs au titre des articles 8 et 9, pour ce qui est du contre-interrogatoire du Dr Silverstone, en même temps que les réclamations en rapport avec les honoraires qui lui ont été versés.
[49]
Les dernières réclamations présentées au titre des articles 8 et 9 concernent le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Kim Seeling. Aux paragraphes 37 et 43 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat fait valoir que ces frais ne devraient pas être accordés puisque c'est en raison d'une directive de la Cour que Mme Seeling a été appelée à témoigner, le 27 novembre 2009, à l'audience relative à la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Il considère que les frais réclamés à ce titre font double emploi avec les réclamations présentées par les défendeurs au titre des articles 13
b
) et 14
a
) pour la préparation et la présence en Cour.
[50]
Au paragraphe 30 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate soutient que la présence et le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Seeling le dernier jour de l'audience relative au contrôle judiciaire ont été ordonnés par la Cour. Elle soutient qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une demande en double, car les avocats étaient tenus de préparer le témoin et d'organiser la livraison des éléments saisis.
[51]
Après examen du dossier de la Cour, j'ai confirmé que Mme Seeling a été appelée le 27 novembre 2009 à témoigner à l'audience relative au contrôle judiciaire. Par conséquent, la préparation et la présence du témoin sont prises en compte au titre des articles 13b) et 14a). Comme les défendeurs ont présenté des réclamations au titre des articles 13b) et 14a), l'interrogatoire de Mme Seeling sera pris en compte pour la taxation de ces frais. Leurs réclamations au titre des articles 8 et 9 pour le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Seeling sont donc refusées.
[52]
Les défendeurs ont présenté 32 réclamations, de 6 unités chacune, au titre de l'article 10, pour la préparation des conférences de gestion de l'instance (CGI).
[53]
Au paragraphe 44 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat soutient ce qui suit:
[traduction] Il faut préciser en l'espèce si ce que nous entendons par conférence de gestion d'instance (CGI) dans les cas où le contrôle judiciaire à gestion spéciale en vertu de l'article 383 des Règles est censé être une conférence préparatoire en vertu de l'article 315 (qui comprend les articles 258 à 267 des Règles). En « D. Procédures préalables à l'instruction ou à l'audience », l'article 10 indique simplement « conférence ».
[54]
Puis aux paragraphes 46 et 47, les demandeurs soutiennent ce qui suit:
[traduction]
46.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aux paragraphes [10-11] [...], les dépens relativement à une conférence réclamés au titre des articles 10 et 11 n'ont pas été accordés car il s'agissait d'un contrôle judiciaire, et ces deux articles figurent au titre « D. Procédures préalables à l'instruction ou à l'audience », qui dans les actions s'appuie sur l'article 258 des Règles. Cette décision ne signifie pas que ces procédures ne peuvent s'appliquer à un contrôle judiciaire dans les cas où est rendue une ordonnance en vertu de l'article 315 des Règles. Elle appuie l'affirmation selon laquelle les articles 10 et 11 ne s'appliquent pas à toutes les « conférences » non visées par une requête.
47. Les conférences visées par l'article 258 des Règles exigent une préparation particulière semblable à celle d'une requête, et l'article 10 autorise des unités de montant semblable à celui des requêtes contestées. Il n'y a pour les CGI qui se tiennent dans des instances à gestion spéciale aucune des exigences prévues aux articles 258-267 des Règles (sauf si le juge de la CGI l'ordonne expressément). En l'espèce, il n'y a pas eu d'ordonnance rendue en vertu de l'article 315 des Règles pour imposer des obligations en vertu des articles 258-267 pour aucune des 32 CGI. De même qu'en l'espèce, de nombreuses CGI dans des instances à gestion spéciale exigent peu ou pas de préparation et peuvent ne servir qu'à organiser le calendrier.
[55]
Au paragraphe 49, les demandeurs soutiennent ce qui suit:
[traduction] Il a parfois été décidé que des conférences préparatoires, même celles donnant lieu à des ordonnances, ne sont pas des conférences préparatoires tenues en vertu de l'article 15 des Règles, susceptibles de faire l'objet d'une réclamation au titre des articles 10 et 11 (voir par exemple
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au paragraphe [3] .... Toutefois, il n'est pas clair où se situe la distinction, si tant est qu'elle existe, entre les conférences préparatoires tenues en vertu de l'article 15 des Règles pour lesquelles les articles 10 et 11 s'appliquent sans ambiguïté, et les CGI dans les instances à gestion spéciale, sans argumentation juridique, sans dépôt de mémoire, dans lesquelles il s'agit essentiellement d'organiser le calendrier, et de rendre compte des travaux pour que le dossier continue d'avancer.
[56]
Les demandeurs font de plus valoir que si les réclamations pour la totalité des 32 CGI sont acceptées, cela pourrait avoir pour effet de dissuader d'avoir recours aux CGI dans les instances à gestion spéciale car les frais peuvent être exorbitants. L'avocat des demandeurs prétend en outre que les défendeurs n'ont pas établi qu'ils ont réellement consacré du temps à la préparation des CGI, qu'onze des CGI figurant au paragraphe 52 du mémoire des demandeurs devraient plutôt être classées comme préparations de requête et que les frais les concernant ne sont pas recouvrables sans ordonnance d'adjudication de dépens.
[57]
À partir du paragraphe 37 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate fait valoir que des dépens devraient être accordés aux demandeurs ayant consenti à la gestion du contrôle judiciaire et que les CGI étaient raisonnables et nécessaires, en raison de la nature de l'affaire et des questions en jeu. Puis au paragraphe 39 les défendeurs soutiennent ce qui suit:
[traduction] Les demandeurs citent une affaire à propos du lien avec l'article 258 des Règles et le tarif. Cependant, l'affaire ne limite pas ces articles aux questions
préalables à l'instruction
et, en outre, le titre du tarif est Procédures préalables à l'instruction ou à l'audience. De plus, l'affaire ne fait état d'aucune jurisprudence reconnaissant que les articles 10 et 11 ne peuvent faire l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire. Il ressort clairement de l'article 315 des Règles que la Cour peut ordonner la tenue d'une conférence en vertu des articles 258 à 267 des Règles,
avec les modifications qui s'avèrent nécessaires
. [Soulignement des défendeurs]
Les défendeurs proposent ensuite que, dans plusieurs affaires, des honoraires au titre des articles 10 et 11 ont été acceptés pour des CGI dans des contrôles judiciaires, et que nombre de ces CGI ont porté sur des questions de calendrier. Ils citent à l'appui les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Conseil national des femmes métisses c Canada (Procureur général)
, 2007 CF 961, aux paragraphes 40 et 41,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[58]
Les défendeurs prétendent aussi que si des dépens ne sont pas accordés pour les CGI, les parties pourraient faire usage du temps dont dispose la Cour sans égard aux frais connexes. Leur avocate soutient de plus que la présente affaire dure depuis plus de 10 ans, qu'il ne faut pas se surprendre qu'il y ait eu 32 CGI et que la préparation de ces CGI par des avocats a été nécessaire car nombre d'entre elles traitaient plus que du calendrier.
[59]
Concernant l'article 10, je traiterai d'abord de la question de savoir si les frais de certaines CGI devraient être acceptés parce que ces CGI ont acquis la nature d'une requête. Bien que les défendeurs n'aient pas répondu à cette question, j'ai examiné le dossier de la Cour et je conclus que toutes les CGI dont ont fait état les demandeurs à l'exception de trois ont porté sur les dates des requêtes et l'échange de documents. La Cour a conclu dans les décisions
Sam
,
Conseil national des femmes métisses
et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitées, que l'article 10 pouvait être accepté pour les CGI ayant porté sur les dates des requêtes. Concernant les trois autres CGI mentionnées par les demandeurs, j'ai examiné le résumé d'audience des CGI tenues le 2 avril 2008, le 3 novembre 2008 et le 13 novembre 2008, et je conclus que l'issue de ces CGI a porté directement sur des requêtes pour lesquelles il n'a pas été adjugé de dépens. Selon le résultat d'audience figurant dans le résumé d'audience de la CGI tenue le 2 avril 2008 par exemple, le document de requête 52 est reporté au 9 mai 2008 et [traduction] « les parties acceptent que le paragraphe 18 de l'affidavit de Janice Robinson, à l'onglet 5 du dossier de requête des demandeurs (DOC. 55 - Volume 1) (page 49), soit caviardé et que la mention "Par ordonnance du juge Campbell datée du 2 avril 2008" soit portée dans la marge ». Il ressort aussi clairement du résumé d'audience de la CGI du 3 novembre 2008 que le document de requête 52, examiné précédemment, a été abondamment discuté comme étant « essentiellement annulé ». Enfin, la CGI du 13 novembre 2008 s'est tenue en même temps qu'une requête pour laquelle les dépens n'ont pas été adjugés, et rien ne prouve que l'audience qui a duré 24 minutes ait été surtout consacrée à la CGI. Dans ces conditions, je conclus que le lien entre les CGI des dates susmentionnées et les requêtes a été si fort que la réclamation des défendeurs au titre de l'article 10 ne peut être acceptée. Il s'ensuit que leur réclamation au titre de l'article 11 pour ces dates sera elle aussi refusée.
[60]
Pour ce qui est des 29 CGI restantes, je conviens certes avec les demandeurs que c'est là un nombre impressionnant de CGI pour une seule instance, mais je ne trouve aucun précédent qui restreint le nombre de CGI autorisées. De plus, étant donné la complexité évidente et admise de l'affaire et la durée de l'instance, je conclus que l'on peut s'attendre à un nombre de CGI nécessairement supérieur au nombre habituel. De plus, les défendeurs ont cité plusieurs affaires qui appuient l'acceptation de réclamations au titre de l'article 10 pour des CGI consacrées à des questions de calendrier.
[61]
Concernant la prétention des demandeurs que rien ne prouve que les défendeurs ont réellement consacré du temps à la préparation des CGI, ceux-ci laissent entendre en réponse que de nombreuses CGI ne se sont pas limitées au calendrier et ont exigé de la préparation de la part de l'avocate. La Cour a par ailleurs jugé ce qui suit dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[ ....] Les défendeurs Seed Hawk ont présenté plusieurs réclamations au titre des articles 10 et 11 (respectivement, préparation et présence à la conférence préparatoire). Les demandeurs, en plus de leur argument général concernant la preuve et le résultat de la demande reconventionnelle,
ont soutenu que ces conférences préparatoires étaient brèves et exigeaient peu de préparation et que le tarif ne prévoyait pas un recouvrement pour chacune d'elles
. Pour ce qui est de cet argument, j'estime que la rubrique intitulée « D. Procédures préalables à l'instruction ou à l'audience » dans le tarif est suffisamment générale pour englober de tels services. De plus,
j'hésite à considérer qu'une comparution exigée par la Cour à des fins de gestion de l'instance a un effet si négligeable (chacune de ces neuf conférences préparatoires a duré de 10 à 35 minutes) que l'avocat n'aurait eu aucun travail valable à effectuer
. J'accorde intégralement les réclamations présentées relativement à ces articles du tarif. [Non souligné dans l'original]
[62]
En accord avec la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , je conclus que le fait même que la Cour a jugé nécessaire de tenir 32 CGI indique manifestement que les questions débattues étaient importantes, nécessitant sans doute un travail de préparation sérieux. En revanche, comme le dossier de la Cour indique que nombre des CGI ont été surtout consacrées à l'organisation du calendrier des étapes et à l'échange de documents, je conclus qu'il est raisonnable d'accorder 3 unités par événement pour la réclamation relative aux 29 CGI restantes. Les réclamations au titre de l'article 10 sont donc acceptées pour un total de 87 unités.
[63]
Concernant les 29 réclamations restantes au titre de l'article 11, les parties souscrivent à leurs observations présentées au titre de l'article 10. Conformément à mes conclusions ci-dessus, les 29 réclamations restantes au titre de l'article 11 sont accordées à 1 unité par heure. Après examen du dossier de la Cour, j'ai conclu que le nombre d'heures demandé est raisonnable, à l'exception de celui demandé pour le 24 janvier 2004. J'accepte 30 minutes de durée pour cette CGI, ce qui correspond à la durée inscrite au résumé d'audience. En tenant compte de cet unique rajustement, je conclus que les réclamations présentées au titre de l'article 11 devraient être acceptées pour un total de 10,75 heures, de sorte que j'accorde au total 10,75 unités pour les 29 CGI.
[64]
Les défendeurs ont présenté deux réclamations au titre de l'article 13a) pour la préparation des requêtes entendues le 18 septembre 2003 et le 9 mai 2008. Au paragraphe 48 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate soutient que ces réclamations devraient être retirées si elles sont acceptées au titre de l'article 5.
[65]
Même si les réclamations au titre de l'article 5 ont été refusées, la Cour a déjà jugé que des réclamations au titre de l'article 13a) peuvent être refusées pour des requêtes (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Les réclamations au titre de l'article 13a) pour les requêtes entendues le 18 septembre 2003 et le 9 mai 2008 sont donc refusées.
[66]
Les défendeurs ont aussi présenté des réclamations pour l'audition du contrôle judiciaire, au titre de l'article 13a), préparation de l'instruction ou de l'audience, et 13b), préparation de l'instruction ou de l'audience, pour chaque jour de présence à la Cour après le premier jour. Les demandeurs ne contestent pas le droit des défendeurs de présenter les réclamations, mais ils prétendent que celles-ci devraient être accordées selon la valeur médiane de la colonne III du tableau du tarif B. Au paragraphe 47 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate soutient ce qui suit:
[traduction] [...] Les avocats des défendeurs affirment que le temps consacré à se préparer sans interruption pour la présente affaire a été excessif. Ils se préparaient avant l'audience, mais devaient étoffer leurs observations tous les jours et toutes les fins de semaine de congé. Les avocats du PGC peuvent donner de l'information sur les heures consacrées à se préparer, sans interruption, pendant l'audition de cette affaire qui évoluait pendant qu'elle se déroulait tous les jours à la Cour, de leur travail jusqu'au petit matin presque chaque jour pendant l'audience.
[67]
Concernant l'article 13a), je conclus que la préparation préalable à l'audience n'a sans doute pas inclus celle des témoins qui ont été cités à comparaître, puisqu'il s'agissait d'un contrôle judiciaire. De plus, plusieurs affidavits ont certes été déposés par les défendeurs, mais la réclamation pour le temps qui leur a été consacré a été acceptée au titre des articles 2, articles 8 et 9. Par conséquent, les réclamations au titre de l'article 13a) sont acceptées à 3 unités pour la préparation préalable à l'audition du contrôle judiciaire.
[68]
Concernant l'article 13b), les défendeurs ont fait valoir que de longues périodes de préparation ont été nécessaires après chaque journée passée à la Cour. Étant donné la nature de la présente instance, j'estime que le nombre d'unités que ceux-ci demande est raisonnable. J'accorde donc au total 42 unités pour la réclamation au titre de l'article 13b).
[69]
Concernant la réclamation des défendeurs au titre de l'article 14a), pour le premier avocat, pour chaque heure de présence à la Cour, les demandeurs font valoir au paragraphe 57 de leur mémoire qu'ils sont d'accord à cet égard et acceptent la valeur médiane de la colonne III mais que, pour les motifs exposés à l'égard de l'article 9, il faudrait retirer le temps consacré aux repas et aux pauses. L'avocat des demandeurs indique le temps à retirer de chaque journée en haut de la page 16 du mémoire des demandeurs.
[70]
Au paragraphe 49 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate fait valoir que la complexité et la longueur de l'affaire justifient leur réclamation à la valeur maximale de l'article 14a), et que les pauses ne reflètent pas fidèlement le temps consacré à la préparation des réponses aux arguments des demandeurs.
[71]
Concernant l'article 14a), il a été décidé qu'aucun montant ne peut être accordé pour les pauses repas au titre de cet article, et que les brèves suspensions d'audience, lorsque l'avocat doit rester dans la salle d'audience ou se tenir à proximité de celle-ci peuvent être acceptées (voir la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 205, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En accord avec ces décisions, je réduis le nombre d'heures réclamées de façon à retirer une heure par journée réclamée afin de tenir compte de la pause repas. J'estime que le temps au-delà d'une heure peut être accepté, car les avocats ont besoin de revenir au tribunal pour organiser leurs idées et se préparer à reprendre l'audience. Concernant le nombre acceptable d'unités, en accord avec ma décision concernant l'article 13a), j'accorde 2 unités l'heure pour les 14 premiers jours, car il s'agissait d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire sans nécessité d'interroger ou de contre-interroger des témoins. J'accorde 3 unités l'heure pour la dernière journée de l'audience, le 27 novembre 2009, car c'est ce jour-là que Mme Seeling a témoigné (voir paragraphe 49 ci-dessus). Pour les raisons qui précèdent, j'accorde donc au total 171 unités pour la réclamation au titre de l'article 14a).
[72]
Le service suivant à taxer réclamé par les défendeurs est l'article 24, déplacement de l'avocat pour assister à l'instruction, une audience, une requête, un interrogatoire ou une procédure analogue, à la discrétion de la Cour. Les défendeurs ont présenté 3 réclamations de 5 unités chacune pour des déplacements afin d'assister à la requête du 9 mai 2008 et à l'audition du contrôle judiciaire à Calgary (Alberta) du 2 au 20 novembre 2009 et à Vancouver (Colombie-Britannique) le 27 novembre 2009. En réponse aux réclamations des défendeurs, l'avocat des demandeurs fait valoir que l'article 24 est à la discrétion de la Cour, que des dépens relatifs aux déplacements n'ont été ordonnés ni pour la requête ni pour le contrôle judiciaire, et que, par conséquent, la réclamation devrait être refusée. L'avocat cite à l'appui les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 11, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 8.
[73]
Dans les observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate soutient ce qui suit:
[traduction] Les demandeurs ont déposé la demande d'audience et ont choisi Calgary pour la tenue de celle-ci. La Cour a ordonné aux parties d'être présentes à l'audience à Calgary du 2 au 20 novembre, puis à Vancouver le 27 novembre 2009. Les déplacements des avocats pour assister à l'audition du contrôle judiciaire ont donc été « à la discrétion de la Cour ».
[74]
Je relève que l'article 24 prévoit: « à la discrétion de la Cour ». Après examen du dossier, j'ai confirmé que la Cour n'a pas exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour adjuger des dépens relatifs aux déplacements des avocats. Comme en a décidé la Cour dans les décisions <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et
Carr
, précitées, sans ordonnance ou directive de sa part, l'agent taxateur n'est pas compétent pour accepter les services à taxer relatifs aux déplacements. En accord avec ces décisions et avec de nombreuses autres, je conclus que les réclamations au titre de l'article 24 ne peuvent être acceptées, la Cour n'ayant pas adjugé de dépens pour des services à taxer relatifs aux déplacements. Les réclamations des défendeurs au titre de l'article 24 sont donc refusées.
[75]
Les défendeurs ont réclamé 1 unité au titre de l'article 25 pour des services rendus après le jugement. Comme les demandeurs n'ont pas contesté cette réclamation, elle est acceptée telle qu'elle a été présentée dans le mémoire de dépens révisé.
[76]
Les défendeurs ont réclamé 6 unités au titre de l'article 26 pour la taxation des dépens. L'avocat fait valoir au paragraphe 60 du mémoire des demandeurs que cette réclamation devrait être acceptée à la valeur médiane, car les observations des défendeurs ont été essentiellement identiques à celles présentées à la Cour lors du débat sur le droit aux dépens. Au paragraphe 52 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate soutient ce qui suit:
[traduction] À propos de l'article 26, le PGC soutient qu'étant donné le nombre de documents déposés jusqu'à présent par les deux parties, les frais à la valeur supérieure de la colonne III sont pleinement justifiés. Le 7 juin 2013, le PGC a déposé pour cette taxation un mémoire de dépens couvrant plusieurs années, un affidavit des débours en trois volumes et des observations en deux volumes. Jusqu'à présent, les demandeurs ont déposé un affidavit en deux volumes et une réponse en quatre volumes. La réponse du PGC devrait également être prise en compte.
[77]
Comme les défendeurs l'ont indiqué, la présente taxation des dépens a engendré plusieurs volumes de documents de la part des deux parties. Les demandeurs ont en outre contre-interrogé Tabitha Potts concernant l'affidavit des débours. Dans ces conditions, je conclus que la réclamation des défendeurs est amplement justifiée. J'accorde donc 6 unités pour la réclamation au titre de l'article 26.
[78]
Concernant la réclamation par les défendeurs de 3 unités au titre de l'article 27 pour d'autres services acceptés aux fins de la taxation par l'officier taxateur, l'avocate des défendeurs soutient au paragraphe 192 des observations de ses clients qu'elle porte sur divers articles comme des frais de parajuriste engagés lors d'un déplacement à l'Université de l'Alberta pour avoir accès à des documents ne se trouvant pas dans la collection du ministère de la Justice et pour livrer des documents à des représentants du ministère client.
[79]
Au paragraphe 61 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat fait valoir en réponse:
[traduction] [...] Ce sont des débours que les défendeurs réclament en tant que tels. S'ils présentent une réclamation portant sur des heures de parajuriste, il doit s'agir d'heures dont les frais peuvent être recouvrés par les avocats. Concernant l'affirmation « pour livrer des documents à des représentants du ministère client », les défendeurs présentent une réclamation au titre de l'article 25 afin de rendre compte au client. Celle-ci constituerait une double réclamation si celle-ci porte sur le temps passé et non sur les débours. Les frais de « parajuriste engagés lors d'un déplacement à l'Université » sont réclamés en tant que débours (aff. de Mme Potts p. 92, et pièce Z p. 262-4). Si la réclamation vise le temps passé par des parajuristes, celui-ci est couvert par l'article 13a), au titre duquel les défendeurs ont déjà présenté une réclamation. Aucune ordonnance n'a été rendue à l'égard d'un second avocat, qui autoriserait une réclamation en double. L'article 27 ne vise pas des services qui se chevauchent et qui ont déjà été indemnisés dans le tarif B, mais des services « autres ».
[80]
Au paragraphe 53 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate prétend ce qui suit:
[traduction] Ainsi que l'indique le paragraphe 192 des observations initiales du PGC déposées le 7 juin 2013, le PGC demande des dépens au titre de l'article 27 pour « des frais de parajuriste engagés lors d'un déplacement à la faculté de droit de l'Université de l'Alberta pour avoir accès à des livres et à des documents ne se trouvant pas dans la collection du ministère de la Justice [...] ». J'indique que ces documents étaient les versions anciennes ou antérieures de la
Loi sur les aliments et drogues
et de son règlement, qui étaient nécessaires pour établir l'argumentation des défendeurs fondée sur la « sauvegarde » par l'application de l'article premier de la Charte, en cas de conclusion par la Cour que les demandeurs avaient porté atteinte à la Charte. La lecture du MFD que les défendeurs ont présenté pour le contrôle judiciaire montrera qu'ils ont examiné l'historique législatif des lois et des règlements pertinents ainsi que les débats de la Chambre des communes de 1920 à 2003 (voir paragraphes 8-39 et les onglets des sources citées dans le MFD des défendeurs déposé pour le contrôle judiciaire).
[81]
L'article 27 du tableau du tarif B figurant dans les
Règles des Cours fédérales
vise d' « autres services acceptés aux fins de la taxation par l'officier taxateur ou ordonnés par la Cour ». Les défendeurs ont présenté une réclamation pour les services de parajuriste à propos de recherches menées préalablement à la préparation de leur mémoire des faits et du droit. L'article 27 ne s'applique que pour les services qui ne sont pas visés par les articles 1 à 26, ainsi que la Cour l'a conclu au paragraphe 131 de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. Concernant la réclamation des défendeurs, je conclus que des recherches liées à la préparation d'un mémoire des faits et du droit sont à juste titre incluses à l'article 2. Dans ces conditions, je conclus que les services réclamés ne peuvent être acceptés au titre de l'article 27. La réclamation des défendeurs au titre de l'article 27 est donc refusée.
[82]
Les défendeurs ont réclamé 154 unités au titre de l'article 28 pour les services fournis par un parajuriste lors de l'audition du contrôle judiciaire afin d'aider la Cour et les parties à trouver des documents dans les dossiers des parties. Les demandeurs prétendent en réponse que les défendeurs ont déjà déposé une réclamation visant les mêmes heures du premier avocat au titre de l'article 14a). Puis l'avocat des demandeurs soutient au paragraphe 63:
[traduction] L'article 14b) exige une ordonnance de la Cour pour le second avocat. Les défendeurs peuvent uniquement réclamer la vacation d'un seul avocat. Ils ont déposé une réclamation au titre de l'article 14a) pour un avocat. L'article 28 vise le travail du parajuriste dans la mesure où il réduit celui de l'avocat. L'article 28 n'est pas censé être une indemnité supplémentaire qui permette la double facturation d'un article réclamé par l'avocat. À titre subsidiaire, cette réclamation pourrait se limiter à la durée réelle de la vacation, soit 70 min 27 s.
L'avocat cite à l'appui la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[83]
Les défendeurs soutiennent en réponse qu'ils se fondent sur les documents déposés le 7 juin 2013, qui ont été mentionnés précédemment.
[84]
Les circonstances exposées dans la décision
Air Canada
, précitée, sont essentiellement identiques à celles de l'espèce. L'officier taxateur a conclu au paragraphe 15 de cette décision:
En revanche, l'article G28 ne sous-entend pas le paiement d'une rémunération supplémentaire à celle qui est déjà demandée et approuvée pour l'avocat responsable du dossier. Il indique plutôt le paiement d'une rémunération représentant « 50 p. 100 du montant qui serait calculé pour les services d'un avocat » (non souligné à l'original). Il s'agit de la situation de l'avocat qui délègue une tâche à un auxiliaire; lorsque l'auxiliaire rend un service dans le cadre de cette délégation, l'avocat responsable peut ensuite facturer le client en conséquence à un taux horaire inférieur. L'article G28 prévoit donc une rémunération réduite dans le cadre des frais et honoraires entre parties. De plus, je doute que le Tarif, dont l'application exige des directives spéciales de la Cour dans les circonstances propres aux articles E14b) et F22b), visait à accorder le droit absolu à une rémunération dans le cas des auxiliaires.
L'officier taxateur conclut plus loin dans le paragraphe « [d] ans la présente affaire, la défenderesse a déjà indemnisée en application des articles D13a) et E14a), de sorte qu'elle ne peut réclamer aucun montant sous l'article G28 ». En accord avec ces conclusions et puisque j'ai accepté aux paragraphes 67 et 71 les réclamations au titre des articles 13a) et 14a) respectivement, je conclus que les réclamations des défendeurs au titre de l'article 28 ne peuvent être acceptées. Ces réclamations pour la présence d'un parajuriste à l'audition du contrôle judiciaire sont donc refusées.
Les débours
Le Dr Silverstone
[85]
Les défendeurs ont présenté des débours d'un montant total de 172 500 $ pour les services du Dr Silverstone, témoin expert qui a souscrit deux affidavits présentés en réponse à la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Concernant les services dispensés par le Dr Silverstone, les défendeurs ont fait valoir que les connaissances spécialisées et l'expertise du Dr Silverstone étaient nécessaires afin de répondre correctement à la thèse des demandeurs. Puis au paragraphe 204 des observations des défendeurs sur les dépens, l'avocate soutient ce qui suit:
[traduction]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  débours des défendeurs parce qu'une requête en rejet de la demande avait été présentée tardivement mais avait été accueillie. Mme Parent a conclu que le jour de l'audition de la requête en rejet, les parties devaient être tout à fait prêtes pour la requête et également pour la demande sur le fond et, citant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  posteriori. Ce principe s'applique pour accepter ce débours, même si le témoignage du Dr Silverstone a été finalement déclaré non pertinent et donc inadmissible, en raison de la décision de la Cour sur la question de la qualité pour agir contre le demandeur.
[86]
À partir de la page 18 du mémoire des demandeurs, l'avocat expose en 20 pages les motifs pour lesquels toutes les réclamations concernant le Dr Silverstone devraient être refusées. Aux paragraphes 65 et 66, l'avocat soutient qu'il a défendu la requête en radiation visant la majeure partie de l'affidavit du Dr Silverstone lors de l'audition du contrôle judiciaire, mais que rien n'a été décidé, le témoignage du Dr Silverstone ayant été exclu au motif qu'il n'était pas pertinent. Les demandeurs soutiennent ensuite que des questions de politique publique jouent en leur faveur, que selon la proportionnalité, les débours concernant le Dr Silverstone représentent plus de 40 pour cent du montant total des réclamations présentées par les défendeurs dans leur mémoire de dépens, que le Dr Silverstone a présenté des arguments plutôt que des preuves impartiales, et qu'il est allé au-delà de son domaine de spécialité et a mal cité des études. Puis, à partir du paragraphe 125, l'avocat prétend que la Cour a exclu le témoignage d'expert du Dr Silverstone pour inadmissibilité parce que les parties n'ont pas pu présenter de preuve sur EMPowerplus (EMP), que la Cour a indiqué pendant l'audience que la question de l'efficacité, objet principal de l'affidavit du Dr Silverstone, était sans pertinence, et que la Cour a précisé que la question de la sécurité soulevée par le Dr Silverstone était sans pertinence. Au paragraphe 127, l'avocat soutient que les frais relatifs à des preuves inadmissibles ne devraient pas être acceptés à la taxation des dépens. Il cite à l'appui les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  défendeurs, l'avocate soutient ce qui suit:
[traduction] Le PGC fait valoir que les observations des demandeurs aux paragraphes 88-128 ne devraient pas être prises en compte. Ils tentent indûment, dans le contexte d'une taxation de dépens, de faire trancher la question de savoir si le témoignage d'expert du Dr Silverstone aurait été admis au contrôle judiciaire, n'eût été son exclusion en raison de sa non-pertinence (encore une fois, parce que la Cour a rejeté la position des demandeurs sur la question de la qualité pour agir). Le PGC fait valoir en toute déférence que telle n'est pas la fonction de l'officier taxateur.
L'avocate des défendeurs soutient ensuite que le témoignage du Dr Silverstone a été nécessaire, et a été une conséquence directe de la position incorrecte des demandeurs concernant la question de la qualité pour agir. Elle soutient aussi que le témoignage du Dr Silverstone a été nécessaire en raison de l'argument des demandeurs fondé sur la Charte, qui reposait sur la prémisse que l'EMP traite véritablement des maladies mentales graves et que les mesures de Santé Canada leur ont refusé l'accès à ce traitement, portant ainsi atteinte aux droits que leur confère la Charte. Au paragraphe 74 de la réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate soutient qu'en cas de réfutation de la prémisse des demandeurs que l'EMP est un traitement, leur argument fondé sur la Charte serait rejeté car on ne saurait soutenir que Santé Canada a refusé l'accès au traitement. Enfin les défendeurs font valoir ce qui suit au paragraphe 75:
[traduction] Les défendeurs ne pouvaient prédire l'issue de la question de la qualité pour agir et devaient être préparés à une décision défavorable sur cette question et préparer leurs arguments sur l'hypothèse de l'admission de tous les éléments de preuve déposés par les demandeurs. Le PGC soutient donc que les honoraires relatifs au Dr Silverstone ont été nécessaires et raisonnables - non seulement leur existence mais aussi leur montant, étant donné que celui-ci a dû répondre à chaque affidavit qu'ont présenté les demandeurs.
[88]
Avant d'établir le montant des débours concernant le Dr Silverstone, je dois rendre une décision sur la question de savoir si les frais relatifs à des preuves inadmissibles devraient être acceptés dans une taxation des dépens entre parties ou si, comme l'ont soutenu les défendeurs, l'appréciation a posteriori ne devrait pas être un facteur de la taxation des dépens et si les débours connexes devraient donc être accordés, même si la preuve du Dr Silverstone a finalement été déclarée non pertinente et donc inadmissible.
[89]
Au paragraphe 76 des Motifs de l'ordonnance et ordonnance, en date du 20 janvier 2010, la Cour a conclu ce qui suit:
Une bonne partie de la preuve contestée a été présentée en présumant que la preuve à l'appui des prétentions au titre de la Charte des usagers autres que les demandeurs est pertinente pour la présente demande. Comme il a été déterminé dans la section précédente des présents motifs que la présente demande avait une portée plus étroite, cette preuve n'est plus pertinente. Je conclus que les requêtes en radiation des défendeurs et des demandeurs peuvent être abordées sur cette base. Les règles juridiques concernant la pertinence et l'admissibilité d'éléments de preuve sont les suivantes:
[traduction]
Les faits en litige, parfois appelés les « principaux » faits, sont ceux qui sont nécessaires en droit pour établir la demande, la responsabilité ou le moyen de défense faisant l'objet de l'instance, et qui sont contestés par les parties [note de bas de page omise].
[...]
Il faut distinguer
la pertinence
de
l'admissibilité
, qui en est la première mais nullement la seule condition. Une preuve peut être pertinente, mais pour des motifs de commodité ou de politique, être inadmissible. En fait, cette exclusion de ce qui est par ailleurs pertinent a été qualifié de trait distinctif du droit anglais sur la preuve. Il est donc justifié, pour décider si un élément de preuve est admissible, de se demander d'abord s'il est
pertinent
, et ensuite d'examiner s'il existe des règles ou une discrétion fondées sur la commodité ou une politique qui rendent néanmoins cette preuve
pertinente
inadmissible
.
[Souligné dans l'original.]
(
Phipson on Evidence
, 16e éd. (London: Sweet and Maxwell, 2005), par. 7 - 02, 7 - 05)
La décision de la Cour d'appel de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 23, est également instructive:
[traduction]
Une preuve est pertinente lorsque, selon la logique et l'expérience humaine, elle rend l'existence ou l'absence d'un important fait en litige plus ou moins vraisemblable [...]. Une preuve ne sera pas pertinente si elle ne rend pas le fait auquel elle se rapporte plus ou moins vraisemblable, ou encore
si ce fait n'a pas d'importance dans la procédure
.
La pertinence est contextuelle dans la mesure où elle dépend des faits en litige, de la position des parties par rapport à ces faits et des autres éléments de preuve présentés à l'appui de ces faits: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  p. 338 (C.S.C.).
Parce que la pertinence est contextuelle, le tribunal sera souvent dans l'impossibilité de déterminer si un élément de preuve est pertinent au moment où il est présenté, mais l'accueillera sous condition et se prononcera sur sa pertinence au moment où il aura un portrait plus complet de l'ensemble de la preuve
. Cela ne signifie toutefois pas que parce qu'il est souvent impossible de déterminer la pertinence d'une preuve au moment où elle est produite, la question de la pertinence ne doit pas être abordée au moment où la preuve est présentée.
Si le tribunal est convaincu à ce moment que la preuve n'est pas pertinente, il doit se prononcer en ce sens et refuser de l'admettre. Le tribunal ne doit pas accueillir un élément de preuve au cas où peut-être, éventuellement, à un certain moment elle deviendrait pertinente.
[Souligné par la Cour.]
[90]
Concernant le témoignage du Dr Silverstone, la Cour a conclu au paragraphe 84 des Motifs de l'ordonnance et ordonnance:
Pour la même raison que pour les témoignages d'expert de M. Kaplan et du Dr Popper concernant la requête en radiation des défendeurs, je conclus que le témoignage d'expert du Dr Silverstone, psychiatre, visant à établir l'effet thérapeutique d'EMpowerplus, n'est pas pertinent.
[91]
Concernant les Drs Kaplan et Popper, la Cour affirme aux paragraphes 79 et 80 des motifs:
Bien qu'il ne soit pas contesté que les usagers d'EMpowerplus rapportent une amélioration de leur santé mentale après avoir pris le produit selon la posologie recommandée, il y a controverse sur la question de savoir si EMpowerplus réussit à traiter la maladie mentale en raison des qualités qui lui sont propres, ou si les résultats obtenus sont simplement la conséquence d'un effet placébo qui le rend efficace en raison des attentes des patients. Étant donné la portée limitée de la présente demande telle qu'il a été établi plus haut, je suis d'avis que la question ne constitue pas un fait en litige parce qu'elle ne se poserait que si les droits des usagers garantis par la Charte étaient en jeu. C'était la stratégie des demandeurs, mais elle a échoué.
Je conclus donc que la preuve par affidavit suivante n'est pas pertinente: les témoignages de Mme Coulson et de Mme Oxby qui visent à établir l'effet positif qu'a eu l'EMpowerplus sur leur vie; le témoignage de M. LaJeunesse, un ancien directeur de l'Association canadienne pour la santé mentale, qui vise à appuyer les allégations des usagers; et les opinions d'expert de M. Kaplan, un psychologue, et du Dr Popper, un psychiatre, qui visent à établir l'effet thérapeutique d'EMpowerplus.
[92]
Puis, au paragraphe 85 des Motifs de l'ordonnance et ordonnance en date du 20 janvier 2010, la Cour a conclu que « la preuve déclarée non pertinente est inadmissible. »
[93]
En résumé, je conclus que la Cour a jugé que le témoignage du Dr Silverstone était non pertinent et inadmissible, du fait de la portée étroite de la demande de contrôle judiciaire en conséquence des conclusions de la Cour aux paragraphes 57 à 74 des Motifs de l'ordonnance et ordonnance en date du 20 janvier 2010.
[94]
Concernant l'argument de « l'appréciation a posteriori » des défendeurs, je conclus que la présente affaire se distingue de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . L'officier taxateur a conclu dans cette décision qu'en conséquence de la requête en rejet, [traduction] « les parties devaient être tout à fait prêtes pour la requête en rejet et également pour la demande sur le fond ». Il n'y a aucune indication dans la décision Abbott que la Cour a conclu à l'inadmissibilité des témoignages d'expert. En revanche, je me trouve devant la conclusion tirée par la Cour que le témoignage du Dr Silverstone est non pertinent et inadmissible. Étant donné cette conclusion, il faut déterminer l'effet de celle-ci, et ne pas simplement accepter les débours en se basant sur la prémisse que les parties devaient être pleinement préparées à l'instruction.
[95]
La Cour a conclu ce qui suit concernant la pertinence et l'admissibilité dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[...] Lorsque des experts sont cités par les deux parties et qu'ils expriment des opinions divergentes, la Cour doit opter pour l'une d'elles à moins qu'elle ne décide de rejeter les deux et de leur substituer sa propre opinion en se fondant sur les éléments de preuve; mais ce n'est pas parce que le rapport d'un expert est rejeté ou qu'il n'est pas accepté intégralement que celui-ci ne peut être remboursé des frais qu'il a faits pour la préparation de son expertise,
à moins que la Cour ne conclue que la demande d'un tel rapport était tout à fait inutile ou son contenu inutilisable
. [...] [Non souligné dans l'original]
[96]
Au paragraphe 51 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), citant la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'officier taxateur a conclu ce qui suit:
Comme la Cour fédérale a statué que la plus grande partie des éléments de preuve joints à l'affidavit de Frank Tassone étaient « inutiles » et a conclu à leur « inadmissibilité », j'estime que la défenderesse Apotex ne devrait pas avoir le droit de réclamer l'intégralité des honoraires des experts. Pour ces motifs et compte tenu du principe énoncé dans l'arrêt Grace M. Carlile, précité, selon lequel « il serait absurde de n'accorder aucun montant », j'exerce mon pouvoir discrétionnaire et j'accorde un montant réduit de 500 $ pour les honoraires d'expert de Frank Tassone.
[97]
L'officier taxateur semble accepter un montant inférieur parce que la Cour n'a pas conclu à l'inadmissibilité totale des éléments de preuve. Dans le cadre de la révision de la décision de l'officier taxateur, la Cour a conclu ce qui suit aux paragraphes 31 et 32 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (la révision de

:
L'officier taxateur a lui-même fait observer au paragraphe [12] de ses motifs que le juge Mosley avait conclu, aux paragraphes [60] et [61] de ces mêmes motifs, qu'
il était inapproprié de la part d'Apotex de verser en preuve l'affidavit de M. Tassone
, qu'Apotex n'avait pas fait de véritable effort pour expliquer en quoi la plupart des documents joints à cet affidavit étaient pertinents et admissibles et qu'il était inutile et excessif de « déverser » en l'instance les éléments de preuve déposés dans le cadre du procès américain par le biais de l'affidavit de M. Tassone. Il a conclu que
la plupart des éléments de preuve contenus dans l'affidavit de M. Tassone étaient inadmissibles et il a vigoureusement découragé « la répétition d'une telle pratique
».
Compte tenu des commentaires du juge Mosley, j'estime que l'officier taxateur a commis une erreur en se fondant dans ce contexte sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  les débours concernant M. Tassone est à ce point déraisonnable qu'il doit être attribuable à une erreur de principe. Par conséquent,
je suis d'avis de ramener de 500 $ à zéro les frais taxés à cet égard
. [Non souligné dans l'original]
[98]
Dans la révision de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour a souligné que le juge Mosley avait estimé que le dépôt en preuve de l'affidavit était inutile et excessif. Donc, même si la totalité des éléments visés par l'affidavit Tassone n'étaient pas inadmissibles, la Cour a réduit à néant le montant établi par l'officier taxateur. Je conclus que ce choix est conforme à la conclusion relative au caractère nécessaire tirée par la Cour dans la décision Carruthers, précitée.
[99]
Dans l'affaire dont je suis saisi, la Cour a conclu que le témoignage du Dr Silverstone était non pertinent et irrecevable et, conformément aux conclusions tirées dans les décisions <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et la révision de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitées, les débours réclamés pour les services de Dr Silverstone ne sont pas autorisés.
[100]
Les arguments suivants sont exposés au paragraphe 132 du mémoire des demandeurs:
[traduction]
S'il est accepté qu'aucuns frais ne devraient être acceptés pour le Dr Silverstone, en plus de ses honoraires d'expert, les frais suivants devraient aussi être rejetés:
a. article 8 concernant le Dr Silverstone;
b. article 9 concernant le Dr Silverstone;
c. 1 322,50 $ pour les transcriptions (affidavit de Mme Potts), pièce BB, p. 325);
d. la portion des copies et des onglets pour affidavits attribuable à l'affidavit du Dr Silverstone (affidavit de Mme Potts, p. 92-93, pièce Z 265-8, 270);
e. la portion du dossier des défendeurs et des frais de messagerie attribuable à l'affidavit du Dr Silverstone.
Les défendeurs n'ont présenté aucun argument en réponse relativement à ces points.
[101]
Ayant conclu que les débours relatifs aux honoraires d'expert du Dr Silverstone ne pouvaient pas être autorisés, je conclus aussi que les honoraires et les débours associés au contre-interrogatoire du Dr Silverstone ainsi que les débours relatifs au service de copies et au dépôt de son affidavit ne devraient pas être autorisés. Dans ces circonstances, les sommes réclamées au titre de l'article 8 et de l'article 9 pour le contre-interrogatoire du Dr Silverstone du 5 au 7 août 2009 et les débours de 1 322,50 $ pour la transcription du contre-interrogatoire du Dr Silverstone ne sont pas autorisés. De plus, les sommes de 140,59 $ et de 86,46 $, respectivement pour les copies et les frais de messagerie, associées aux affidavits du Dr Silverstone, sont refusées.
Déplacements
[102]
En ce qui a trait aux débours relatifs aux déplacements, l'avocat des demandeurs a soulevé deux questions, soit les frais de déplacement pour le second avocat et les frais de déplacement pour la rencontre des clients et la préparation des témoins. Je vais examiner chacune de ces questions avant de trancher la question du montant des débours qui serait autorisé.
[103]
Selon un argument qui figure au paragraphe 200 des observations des défendeurs sur les dépens, les frais de déplacement du second avocat peuvent être autorisés même en l'absence d'une directive de la Cour autorisant des honoraires pour le second avocat. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie sur les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[104]
Voici un extrait du paragraphe 135 du mémoire des demandeurs:
[traduction] [...] Les demandeurs n'ont aucune objection à l'égard des frais de déplacement d' « un » avocat pour les interrogatoires relatifs au contrôle judiciaire (et non relativement aux requêtes) et pour sa présence lors de l'instance de contrôle judiciaire. La Cour n'a pas exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire pour ordonner le remboursement des frais de déplacement pour l'un des avocats. Elle n'a pas non plus exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire en ce qui concerne les honoraires du second avocat. L'officier taxateur possède le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'autoriser des débours pour des déplacements même lorsque la Cour n'a pas accordé des frais de déplacement. Cependant, étant donné que ni les frais de déplacement ni les honoraires du second avocat n'ont été accordés, les demandeurs soutiennent que les frais de déplacement du second avocat ne devraient pas être acceptés. Dans le contexte d'un litige qui vise uniquement l'obtention d'une déclaration à l'égard de parties qui ne disposaient pas d'un budget pour un second avocat, les frais de déplacement d'un second avocat sont aussi excessifs. M. Shaw était l'avocat principal. Tous les frais de déplacement de Mme Kaminski et de Mme Oltean ne devraient pas être accordés.
À l'appui de ses observations, l'avocat des demandeurs cite les décisions
Canada (Procureur général) c Peletier
, 2008 CAF 251, au paragraphe 9, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[105]
Voici le paragraphe 77 des observations en réponse des défendeurs:
[traduction] Mme Kaminski était coavocate principale au dossier de 2003 à 2008. M. Shaw était l'avocat principal pendant toute la durée de l'instance et, Mme Oltean, coavocate de 2008 à l'heure actuelle. M. Shaw et Mme Oltean se sont partagé également la préparation et la présentation des observations lors des audiences pour le contrôle judiciaire; Mme Oltean s'est consacrée principalement aux questions de preuve et, M. Shaw, aux questions de fond relatives à la Charte. Étant donné le nombre de témoins de part et d'autre, le nombre de questions de procédure, de preuve et de fond en cause, la présence d'un second avocat dans la présente affaire est amplement justifiée. [...]
[106]
Les avocats des demandeurs et des défendeurs ont présenté des décisions qui semblent contradictoires relativement aux frais de déplacement du second avocat. En effet, dans les deux décisions présentées par les demandeurs, les frais de déplacement du second avocat ont été refusés, et, dans les deux décisions invoquées par les défendeurs, les frais de déplacement du second avocat ont été acceptés en l'absence d'une directive de la Cour prévoyant le remboursement des honoraires d'un second avocat aux termes de l'article 14b) du tableau du tarif B des
Règles des Cours fédérales
. Après avoir pris connaissance de la jurisprudence présentée par les parties, je conclus que les officiers taxateurs ont le pouvoir d'accepter des frais de déplacement raisonnables et nécessaires pour le second avocat lorsque la preuve qui a été présentée le justifie, et ce, même si la Cour n'a pas donné de directive en vertu de l'article 14b). Cependant, peu importe s'il existait une directive de la Cour aux termes de l'article 14b), lorsque la preuve ne justifie pas les frais de déplacement d'un second avocat, l'officier taxateur n'est pas tenu de les accepter.
[107]
Après avoir pris connaissance du dossier de la Cour, des observations et de la preuve soumises et avoir confirmé que tant M. Shaw que Mme Oltean ont joué un rôle actif et ont présenté des arguments devant la Cour, je conclus que, vu les circonstances, les frais de déplacement raisonnables et nécessaires des deux avocats pour les contre-interrogatoires sur les affidavits et leur présence à l'audience relative au contrôle judiciaire sont justifiés.
[108]
En ce qui a trait aux frais de déplacement pour rencontrer des clients et préparer des témoins, à partir du paragraphe 136 du mémoire des demandeurs, les observations suivantes relatives aux déplacements sont formulées:
[traduction]
1. Déplacement de M. Shaw à Ottawa, du 19 au 21 janvier 2009, pour rencontrer ses clients.
2. Déplacement de M. Shaw et de Mme Oltean à Ottawa, du 7 au 13 mars 2009, pour des interrogatoires.
3. Déplacement de M. Shaw et de Mme Oltean à Ottawa, du 5 au 7 mai 2009, pour des interrogatoires et rencontrer le client.
4. Déplacement de M. Shaw et de Mme Oltean à Vancouver, du 21 au 26 juin 2009, pour l'interrogatoire de M. Neske et de Mme Seeling.
5. Déplacement de Mme Kaminski et de M. Shaw à Calgary, du 18 au 21 novembre 2003, pour les interrogatoires de M. Brosseau et de Mme Jarvis.
[109]
Selon l'avocat des demandeurs, les défendeurs réclament le remboursement de frais de déplacement pour rencontrer le représentant des clients, passer en revue les affidavits des demandeurs et préparer les interrogatoires. Il ajoute qu'à cause de l'absence d'interrogatoire à l'horaire pour les périodes visées en mars 2009 et en mai 2009, les déplacements n'étaient pas essentiels. Concernant les déplacements à Vancouver en juin 2009, l'avocat des demandeurs soutient que la durée du séjour n'est pas justifiée étant donné que l'interrogatoire de M. Neske avait duré trois heures et demie le 23 juin 2009 et que l'interrogatoire de Mme Seeling ne s'était déroulé que lors de l'audience relative au contrôle judiciaire. L'avocat affirme aussi que le déplacement à Calgary en novembre 2003 pour l'interrogatoire de M. Brosseau et de Mme Jarvis n'était pas admissible étant donné que les interrogatoires en question ont trait à une requête et que l'interrogatoire de Mme Jarvis a en fait eu lieu le 1er août 2003. L'avocat soutient qu'aucun de ces déplacements n'était essentiel ou nécessaire et que, par conséquent, les frais qui y ont trait devraient être refusés. Les dernières observations de l'avocat au sujet des déplacements figurent aux paragraphes 156 à 158 du mémoire des demandeurs; elles visent notamment une réclamation de transport en avion le 27 novembre 2009 qui, selon l'avocat, n'est pas justifiée parce que les frais réclamés à ce titre auraient dû être partagés avec un autre dossier. L'avocat cite de plus les frais d'interurbains pendant le voyage; or, à son avis, rien ne démontre que les appels portaient sur le présent dossier.
[110]
À partir du paragraphe 78 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate soutient que, contrairement aux observations des demandeurs, le critère d'évaluation de la question de savoir si les débours sont admis consiste à établir s'ils sont raisonnables et nécessaires. Selon l'avocate, la plupart des déposants des défendeurs se trouvaient à Ottawa et à Vancouver et il était logique que les avocats se rendent dans ces endroits pour préparer les témoins. Elle ajoute que les déplacements en vue de la préparation des témoins ne sont pas effectués à cause de l'urgence de la situation, mais parce qu'il est raisonnable et nécessaire d'aider les témoins à souscrire leurs affidavits et à préparer leur contre-interrogatoire. En ce qui a trait au contre-interrogatoire de Mme Seeling, l'avocate soutient qu'il avait été nécessaire de préparer la déposante étant donné que les demandeurs n'avaient pas informé les défendeurs que le contre-interrogatoire se déroulerait uniquement à la date provisoire choisie pour la tenue des interrogatoires. Enfin, à partir du paragraphe 89 des observations en réponse des défendeurs, l'avocate affirme que la modification des honoraires était liée au fait que l'audience du 27 novembre 2009 s'était terminée beaucoup plus tôt que prévu, que le prix des billets d'avion achetés pour le déplacement de M. Shaw du 18 au 21 novembre 2003 ne devrait pas être fractionné avec celui d'un autre dossier étant donné que l'objet principal du déplacement avait trait au présent dossier et que rien ne donne à penser que le coût des appels interurbains réclamé pour le même déplacement n'avait rien à voir avec le présent dossier.
[111]
En ce qui a trait aux déplacements des défendeurs aux diverses dates susmentionnées, dans le but de rencontrer le représentant des clients, de passer en revue les affidavits des demandeurs et de préparer les témoins pour les interrogatoires, je conclus qu'une interprétation ultérieure des déplacements des avocats des défendeurs, qui ont été effectués dans le cadre d'une représentation prudente et raisonnable d'un client relativement à un litige, équivaut à agir après coup. Comme il a été jugé dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  « [l] e critère préliminaire, lorsqu'il s'agit d'indemniser quelqu'un de débours comme ceux-ci, n'est pas fonction de ce qui arrive après coup, mais de la question de savoir si, compte tenu des circonstances existant au moment où il a décidé d'engager les frais le procureur représentait son client d'une façon prudente et raisonnable ». Par ailleurs, je conclus que les déplacements à Calgary de Mme Kaminski et de M. Shaw, du 18 au 21 novembre 2003, pour le contre-interrogatoire de M. Brosseau et de Mme Jarvis, concernent la requête en radiation des défendeurs. Étant donné que les dépens relatifs à la requête et les honoraires liés aux contre-interrogatoires n'ont pas été acceptés, je conclus que les frais de déplacement ne peuvent pas l'être non plus. Dans ce contexte, les inquiétudes des demandeurs quant au fractionnement du prix des billets d'avion et des frais d'interurbains n'ont plus aucun objet.
[112]
En ce qui a trait au déplacement à Vancouver, les 27 et 28 novembre 2003, pour le contre-interrogatoire de M. Neske, malgré l'absence de contestation de la part des demandeurs, comme j'ai estimé que ce contre-interrogatoire était lié à la requête en radiation des défendeurs et, eu égard à la conclusion susmentionnée concernant M. Brosseau et Mme Jarvis, je conclus que les frais de déplacement de novembre 2003 à Vancouver ne peuvent pas être acceptés. De plus, ayant conclu que les défendeurs n'ont pas droit aux frais pour la requête des demandeurs visant la modification de leur demande (document de requête no 52), je conclus que les frais de déplacement réclamés pour les déplacements de Mme Kaminski et de M. Shaw le 9 mai 2008 dans le but d'assister à l'audition de la requête des demandeurs ne peuvent pas être autorisés. De plus, étant donné que les dépenses de Jessica Stalknecht, effectuées pendant qu'elle était en déplacement, n'ont pas été contestées, elles sont autorisées étant donné qu'il s'agit de dépenses raisonnables et nécessaires. Concernant aussi la modification des honoraires pour le vol du 27 novembre 2009, je conclus que l'explication de la situation fournie par les défendeurs est raisonnable et j'accepte la réclamation telle qu'elle a été présentée.
[113]
Enfin, étant donné que les demandeurs n'ont pas fait valoir que les montants réclamés étaient déraisonnables et ayant fait la distinction entre les déplacements raisonnables et nécessaires et ceux qui ne l'étaient pas, j'ai révisé les débours réclamés pour les déplacements et, sous réserve des motifs qui précèdent, je conclus que les autres dépenses réclamées étaient raisonnables et nécessaires. Par conséquent, les débours relatifs aux déplacements sont taxés et autorisés pour un montant total de 36 776,23 $.
Frais de sténographie judiciaire
[114]
Voici des observations relatives aux frais de sténographie judiciaire figurant au paragraphe 143 du mémoire des demandeurs:
[traduction] La somme de 4 339,65 $ est réclamée pour les transcriptions de chaque journée de l'audience relative au contrôle judiciaire, sauf le dernier jour. En règle générale, une transcription quotidienne est exigée lorsqu'une « preuve » est présentée; or, étant donné qu'il s'agissait d'un contrôle judiciaire fondé sur des affidavits, ce n'est pas arrivé avant le dernier jour. Même lorsque la preuve est présentée, les transcriptions quotidiennes sont généralement inutiles et les frais qui y ont trait ne sont pas acceptés, particulièrement lorsque la transcription n'est pas exigée par la partie tenue d'assumer les dépens. Les demandeurs s'opposent à l'acceptation de ces frais, car il s'agit d'un luxe inutile. [...]
À l'appui de ses observations, l'avocat cite les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[115]
En réponse, l'avocate des défendeurs soutient que la décision
Janssen-Ortho
concernait la transcription judiciaire en temps réel et non des transcriptions quotidiennes et que les autres décisions invoquées par les demandeurs sont des décisions à caractère discrétionnaire qui ne définissent aucun principe particulier. Voici un extrait du paragraphe 83 de la réponse des défendeurs:
[traduction] En l'espèce, des transcriptions quotidiennes devaient être établies parce que les observations des parties étaient beaucoup plus nombreuses que leurs observations écrites. La réclamation du remboursement des frais des transcriptions quotidiennes n'est pas inhabituelle ou déraisonnable dans le cadre d'une audience d'une telle durée, aussi complète et englobant bon nombre de questions d'une nature particulière.
[116]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> l'officier taxateur, s'appuyant sur la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, a conclu que les transcriptions quotidiennes des déclarations d'ouverture et des arguments ne donnaient pas droit à un remboursement, mais que c'était seulement le cas pour les témoignages et les motifs donnés oralement. En l'espèce, les défendeurs justifient la nécessité d'une transcription quotidienne par le fait que les observations présentées oralement allaient plus loin que les observations écrites. À mon avis, les observations des défendeurs ne justifient pas l'acceptation des frais relatifs aux transcriptions quotidiennes étant donné qu'aucun témoin n'a été convoqué aux dates pour lesquelles les transcriptions quotidiennes ont été commandées. De plus, je ne juge pas raisonnable que les demandeurs soient tenus de rembourser aux défendeurs des dépenses qui n'étaient pas raisonnables et nécessaires. Par conséquent, la réclamation de 4 339,65 $ présentée par les défendeurs relativement à la transcription quotidienne de l'audience relative au contrôle judiciaire est refusée.
[117]
En ce qui a trait aux autres débours de sténographie judiciaire, même si la question n'a pas été soulevée par les demandeurs, je conclus que les montants réclamés relativement à la transcription du contre-interrogatoire de M. Brosseau et de Mme Jarvis (intervenants désintéressés - 3 décembre 2003 - 195,20 $) ne peuvent pas être accordés étant donné que le contre-interrogatoire visait la requête en radiation des défendeurs, à l'égard de laquelle aucuns frais n'ont été acceptés. De plus, les débours relatifs à la transcription de l'audition de la requête des demandeurs visant à modifier leur demande (document de requête no 52), qui a eu lieu le 9 mai 2008, ne peuvent pas être acceptés étant donné qu'aucuns frais n'ont été adjugés relativement à la requête. Enfin, comme il a été conclu au paragraphe 101 des présents motifs que le remboursement des débours de 1 322,50 $ pour la transcription du contre-interrogatoire du Dr Silverstone n'est pas autorisé. Par conséquent, pour les motifs susmentionnés, la somme totale de 10 031,38 $ est acceptée au regard des débours relatifs à la sténographie judiciaire.
Recherches en ligne
[118]
Les défendeurs ont réclamé des débours de 5 959,98 $ pour des recherches dans Quicklaw entre 2003 et 2009; la majorité de ces recherches ont été effectuées en 2009. La preuve relative à ces débours se trouve dans l'affidavit de Tabitha Potts souscrit le 1er février 2013. Voici un extrait tiré du paragraphe 16 de son affidavit:
[traduction] Jointe à mon affidavit à titre de pièce « I », se trouve une copie des tableaux indiquant les montants facturés au dossier 2-98528 pour la recherche en ligne, totalisant 538,51 $. L'information m'a été fournie par Susan Seutter, spécialiste des finances du ministère de la Justice, et je crois sincèrement que nous avions, au cours de l'exercice 2003-2004, une entente de taux mensuel fixe avec Lexis Nexis. Les factures de Lexis Nexis indiquaient en détail le coût de chaque recherche, selon le temps de recherche, sans que cela ait d'effet sur le taux fixe. Par ailleurs, selon ce que m'a dit Susan Seutter, à la réception de l'état de compte de Lexis Nexis, nos spécialistes des finances ou nos bibliotechniciens établissaient des tableaux, qui constituent l'annexe « I » des présentes, pour calculer la valeur au prorata de tous les frais de recherche, de sorte que ces derniers correspondent au taux fixe et que le service des finances transférerait ensuite dans chaque dossier pertinent les montants qui figurent dans les tableaux.
Aux paragraphes 34 et 40, une preuve semblable est fournie pour les exercices 2008-2009 et 2009-2010.
[119]
Au paragraphe 144 de la réponse des demandeurs, l'avocat cite M.M. Orkin,
The Law on Costs
, 2e édition, Toronto, Canada Law Book, 2012, pages 2-290:
[traduction] La Cour a autorisé des débours pour une recherche dans Quicklaw, mais la tendance consiste plutôt à en rejeter le remboursement en l'absence de circonstances particulières. En effet, il faut examiner avec soin le caractère raisonnable de la somme réclamée. Cependant, un tribunal de l'Alberta a statué que tant les clients que les tribunaux s'attendent à ce que, dans le domaine juridique, la recherche se fasse par ordinateur. Par conséquent, ce tribunal a refusé de rembourser les débours relatifs à la recherche ...
[120]
Voici les observations de l'avocat aux paragraphe 145 et suivants:
[traduction]
Il ressort de toute évidence de la décision albertaine citée par Orkin qu'en Alberta, la province dans laquelle cette instance se déroulait, les frais liés à Quicklaw ne sont pas remboursables étant donné que l'utilisation de Quicklaw, dans le contexte de la taxation des frais, réduit les honoraires facturés à l'heure (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII) [19-25]. Si le même contrôle judiciaire avait eu lieu devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine plutôt que devant la Cour fédérale, la réclamation des défendeurs relative à l'utilisation de Quicklaw serait rejetée parce que ces frais auraient été considérés comme une partie des frais généraux.
Probablement parce que la plupart des utilisateurs de Quicklaw sont passés à la tarification mensuelle, les cours ont généralement commencé à traiter les frais relatifs à Quicklaw comme des frais généraux non soumis à la taxation.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [19];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [78-81];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [39].
Quicklaw facture un montant mensuel fixe aux défendeurs, mais ces derniers n'en révèlent pas le montant (affidavit de (Mme Potts), pages 4, 6 et 7 et contre-interrogatoire de Mme Potts, pages 1-4). Quicklaw était offert à 180 $ par mois et gratuitement dans les bibliothèques des palais de justice (affidavit de Buckley, vol. 1, pages 3-4, pièces C-E). Certains des frais calculés à partir du « tarif fixe » sont excessifs (6 avril 2009, 699,03 $, 29 septembre 2009, 573,19 $ et 11 septembre 2009, 408,12 $), ce qui dépasse bien des fois le tarif mensuel de 180 $ offert aux demandeurs. Il est probable que les défendeurs ont un tarif fixe pour un groupe d'avocats, et que bon nombre d'entre eux n'utilisent pas Quicklaw, ce qui rend excessifs les frais de ceux qui l'utilisent. Si c'est le cas, les défendeurs cherchent en réalité à obtenir le remboursement de frais généraux de bureau dont le caractère raisonnablement nécessaire dans le cadre du présent litige n'est pas établi. Pour 2009, ils réclament 4 725,02 $ pour Quicklaw (soit 26,25 fois le tarif mensuel fixe au taux offert aux demandeurs).
Comme il était mentionné précédemment dans l'affidavit de Mme Potts, pièces I et Y, Quicklaw a été fort probablement utilisé relativement à des requêtes. Le montant consacré à la pièce EE ne peut pas être attribué avec certitude aux requêtes, mais il est improbable que toutes ces recherches aient été effectuées relativement au contrôle judiciaire. La durée des recherches et leur caractère nécessaire ne sont pas non plus bien établis. Les défendeurs n'expliquent pas pour quelles raisons telle recherche devait être effectuée. Ils ne précisent pas non plus l'objet de telle ou de telle recherche. Ils se contentent d'affirmer que ces frais étaient « raisonnables et nécessaires » (mémoire des défendeurs, au paragraphe [201]). L'acceptation de débours sans la preuve que ces derniers étaient essentiels constitue une erreur de droit (
Diversified Products Corp
, précitée, à la dernière page). Parce que la recherche à l'ordinateur est de plus en plus répandue, la preuve pertinente à ce sujet est de plus en plus abondante (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  permettant d'établir le caractère nécessaire ou la pertinence de ces dépenses. Les défendeurs, pour justifier ces dépenses, se contentent d'une déclaration générale selon laquelle elles étaient « raisonnables et nécessaires » (mémoire des défendeurs, au paragraphe [201]). Mme Potts n'a pas pu nous préciser l'objet de l'une quelconque des recherches (contre-interrogatoire de Mme Potts, page 6 L4 à la page 7 L8).
décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relatifs à Quicklaw exposés dans la pièce EE ou dans son affidavit correspondaient aux montants versés à Quicklaw. Elle n'en était pas certaine (contre-interrogatoire de Mme Potts, page 4 L6 à la page 5 L4).
[121]
Selon le paragraphe 84 de la réponse des défendeurs, les frais de recherche juridique relatifs à une affaire comme la présente sont nécessaires et raisonnables et les volumes 20 à 33 du dossier des défendeurs étaient constitués de jurisprudence.
[122]
Il est évident que la jurisprudence, eu égard à la recherche juridique en ligne, est en évolution. Pour cette raison, il y a une certaine incohérence dans l'application des normes pertinentes. Voici un extrait du paragraphe 18 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[traduction] En ce qui a trait aux débours réclamés pour l'utilisation de Quicklaw, même si je n'ai aucune hésitation à accepter des frais pour la recherche juridique, je conclus qu'une réclamation de 200 $ pour une instance de la nature de la présente est excessive. Vu le contexte d'un appel d'une requête de prolongation de délai, et étant donné que je n'ai pas reçu une preuve adéquate pour justifier le montant réclamé et que le recueil de jurisprudence et de doctrine de la défenderesse ne contenait que 10 décisions, j'accepte le remboursement de 75 $ des frais relatifs à Quicklaw puisque j'estime qu'une certaine recherche juridique en ligne était nécessaire.
Cependant, au paragraphe 19 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  assumés dans le cadre d'un litige et qu'elle n'avait pas l'intention d'autoriser des frais pour ce genre de dépenses. Et, au paragraphe 152 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Janssen qu'une partie ne devrait pas être tenue de consacrer une somme disproportionnée à la démonstration du bien-fondé d'un débours, l'affidavit de Mira Rinne et les observations écrites de Janssen nous fournissent très peu d'éléments de preuve pour démontrer qu'il y a eu des centaines de recherches à l'ordinateur. Je pense qu'il est bien connu que les recherches à l'ordinateur sont de plus en plus répandues. Pour cette raison, je suis d'avis que le fardeau de démontrer le caractère nécessaire d'une recherche par ordinateur est maintenant moins lourd, mais que l'obligation de démontrer la pertinence de la recherche est devenue plus contraignante. Pour ces motifs, j'accepterais les frais relatifs à la recherche par ordinateur, mais je me limiterais à accepter environ la moitié des recherches visées par la réclamation étant donné que la preuve de la pertinence était limitée. [...]
[123]
L'approche suivie devant les tribunaux provinciaux a été plus cohérente. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour effectue un examen complet de la jurisprudence relative à la recherche juridique informatisée dans cette province et conclut en ces termes:
[traduction]
[...] les débours réclamés dans ces affaires concernent l'accès aux bases de données juridiques et sont calculés selon le temps consacré à la recherche pour tel client sur telle question. Rien ne permet de conclure que le cabinet d'avocats pourrait obtenir le remboursement du coût des ordinateurs en tant qu'actifs immobilisés. À mon avis, les débours relatifs à la recherche juridique électronique sont semblables aux débours relatifs aux photocopies; en effet, c'est le coût des photocopies qui est remboursé, et non celui des photocopieurs.
Néanmoins, parce que je suis lié par la jurisprudence, je dois refuser d'autoriser le remboursement. À ce stade-ci, notre Cour d'appel devrait peut-être réexaminer cette question mais, vu la jurisprudence existante, je ne suis pas en mesure de le faire.
Voici ce que la Cour a soutenu au paragraphe 81 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[traduction]
En ce qui concerne les frais relatifs à Quicklaw, il est vrai que, dans certains cas, ces dépenses sont nécessaires, ce qui justifie leur remboursement. Mais ce n'est pas automatique. En effet, certains éléments de preuve doivent justifier son utilisation. En l'espèce, je n'ai pas été informé des raisons pour lesquelles les recherches sur Quicklaw étaient nécessaires ou appropriées ou des raisons pour lesquelles les recherches n'auraient pas pu être effectuées au moyen de services en ligne gratuits, plutôt que par l'intermédiaire d'un service payant comme Quicklaw. À ce que je sache, nous n'avons pas été saisis en l'espèce de questions juridiques inhabituelles qui exigeaient l'utilisation de Quicklaw.
La partie demanderesse n'a pas justifié la nécessité ou l'à-propos de ces frais. La réclamation est refusée.
Et au paragraphe 39 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour s'est exprimée en ces termes:
[traduction]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  en ce qui a trait aux débours relatifs à l'utilisation de Quicklaw, la Cour a exprimé l'opinion suivante:
Autres articles particuliers
37,55 $ pour la recherche sur Quicklaw: il y a un certain temps, la recherche en ligne était une nouveauté et les avocats payaient les frais de cette recherche en fonction du temps qui y était consacré et ils pouvaient les rattacher au dossier de tel ou tel client. La plupart des avocats, y compris M. Richey, ne fonctionnent plus de cette façon. En effet, ils payent des frais mensuels fixes, beaucoup moins coûteux, et tirent profit de la capacité du système de repérer les clients ou fichiers individuels et de calculer le montant qui aurait été facturé si l'avocat avait pris le programme de facturation au volume. Ce montant est en fait une fiction parce qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une dépense réellement assumée par l'avocat.
La recherche juridique fait partie du travail de l'avocat. À mon avis, la possibilité d'effectuer de la recherche en ligne facilite la tâche des avocats, et ce, à un coût minime. Des services tout à fait gratuits sont de plus en plus offerts, comme CanLII, qui, au fur et à mesure que les bases de données des services commerciaux prendront du volume, obligeront ces derniers à justifier leurs frais. Pour cette raison, à mon avis, les frais de recherche en ligne font partie des frais généraux et ne sont pas des débours nécessaires qui doivent être incorporés aux dépens partie-partie.
Je n'accepterai donc aucun montant pour les recherches sur Quicklaw.
[124]
Il semble se dessiner dans la jurisprudence qui a été présentée une tendance vers la limitation ou l'élimination des sommes autorisées pour la recherche en ligne. Même si les tribunaux ont conclu dans certains cas que les frais de recherche en ligne pouvaient être considérés comme un élément des frais généraux et non comme des débours nécessaires qui pouvaient être incorporés à la taxation des dépens partie-partie, j'estime qu'il existe encore des circonstances où il peut s'agir d'une demande justifiable. Comme il a été conclu dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  débours relatifs aux photocopies. Cependant, dans le respect de la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  recherche est pertinente. De plus, étant donné que les frais relatifs à la recherche en ligne peuvent se chiffrer à des montants assez élevés, la justification des frais de recherche juridique en ligne est essentielle.
[125]
Vu les conclusions qui précèdent et la jurisprudence susmentionnée, j'estime que pour décider si des recherches en ligne sont raisonnables et nécessaires, il faut produire des éléments de preuve relatifs à la pertinence et au caractère nécessaire des recherches en ligne invoquées dans le mémoire de dépens. De plus, étant donné la preuve des défendeurs selon laquelle ces derniers paient un tarif mensuel fixe, il faut démontrer de quelle façon ces frais ont été attribués à la présente affaire et établir que les sommes réclamées dans le mémoire de dépens reflètent des débours réels. Compte tenu de ces exigences, il est important de souligner que malgré l'obligation d'établir une preuve à cet égard, le coût de l'établissement de la preuve des dépenses en matière de recherche sur Internet ne doit pas être supérieur au montant réclamé (voir:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Compte tenu de ces éléments, je conclus que, dans le cadre de la présente taxation, les défendeurs n'ont pas transmis la preuve requise pour justifier la demande de remboursement des frais liés aux recherches en ligne.
[126]
En ce qui concerne la pertinence et le caractère nécessaire des recherches en ligne à l'égard desquelles les défendeurs réclament des frais, j'ai pris connaissance de la preuve fournie dans l'affidavit de Tabitha Potts et lors du contre-interrogatoire de cette dernière, et j'estime qu'il n'existe aucun élément de preuve relatif à la pertinence des recherches en question. En effet, les défendeurs n'ont fourni aucune preuve relative à l'objet des recherches, à la question de savoir si les recherches concernent le contrôle judiciaire ou une requête ou à la question de savoir si elles ont trait à la contestation fondée sur la Charte ou à la radiation d'un affidavit. En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Potts a été incapable de fournir des éclaircissements sur les recherches qui visaient des requêtes et sur celles qui n'avaient pas trait aux requêtes. En ce qui concerne la preuve du caractère nécessaire des recherches, les défendeurs ont précisé que 20 volumes de leur dossier de demande étaient composés de jurisprudence. Cependant, aucune preuve n'a été présentée au sujet du coût des recherches relatives aux diverses décisions en cause ni sur les recherches en ligne qui portaient sur ces décisions. Il incombe alors à l'officier taxateur de tirer une conclusion sur la pertinence et le caractère nécessaire des recherches selon les dates des recherches. Or, il s'agit d'une tâche impossible. En l'absence de preuve relative à l'objet des recherches, il est impossible de se prononcer sur la pertinence et le caractère nécessaire de telle ou de telle recherche. Il est donc impossible de tirer une conclusion sur la pertinence et le caractère nécessaire des recherches en ligne uniquement à partir du volume de la jurisprudence soumise.
[127]
En ce qui a trait aux tarifs fixes payés par les défendeurs pour les services de Quicklaw, j'ai pris connaissance de la preuve contenue dans l'affidavit de Tabitha Potts et dans le contre-interrogatoire de cette dernière; j'en conclus que Mme Potts a été incapable de fournir quelque renseignement que ce soit au sujet de la ventilation de ces frais. Même si les défendeurs ont soumis certains éléments de preuve qui donnent à penser que les frais fixes ont été répartis proportionnellement, aucun élément de preuve ne démontre de quelle façon l'opération a été effectuée. De plus, selon la preuve des demandeurs, le tarif fixe pour un seul avocat pourrait être d'aussi peu que 180 $ par mois. À la lumière de ces faits, les frais proportionnels de recherche en ligne semblent excessifs étant donné que deux avocats étaient inscrits au dossier pour les défendeurs. Comme l'ont laissé entendre les demandeurs, même si les défendeurs ont un tarif fixe pour un groupe d'avocats, le montant réclamé pourrait être gonflé par suite d'un taux d'utilisation variable selon les avocats. De plus, aucun élément de preuve précis ne m'a été soumis quant à la nature de l'entente des défendeurs sur un tarif mensuel fixe avec Lexis Nexis. Sans cette preuve, il est impossible de savoir dans quelle mesure les calculs fournis par les défendeurs sont appropriés ou si les frais relatifs aux recherches en ligne qui sont réclamés doivent être considérés comme des frais généraux de bureau.
[128]
Vu la conclusion que les défendeurs n'ont pas fourni de preuve quant à la pertinence et au caractère nécessaire des recherches ou à la nature et à la répartition du tarif mensuel fixe, les débours des défendeurs relatifs aux recherches en ligne ne sont pas acceptés.
Photocopies
[129]
Les défendeurs ont réclamé en tout une somme de 12 479,25 $ pour les photocopies. Pour justifier cette demande, il est précisé, au paragraphe 197 des observations des défendeurs sur les frais, que les débours relatifs à la photocopie étaient raisonnables et nécessaires et qu'ils sont confirmés par des factures.
[130]
Au paragraphe 150 du mémoire des demandeurs, il est affirmé que les débours de 5 602,33 $ effectués par les défendeurs pour l'établissement de copies de leur dossier de demande peuvent s'expliquer par la production de six copies du dossier plutôt que des cinq copies habituellement exigées. Voici un extrait de cet argument:
[traduction] [...] Même s'il est mentionné à la page 93 de l'affidavit de Mme Potts que cinq copies ont été effectuées, il est précisé à la page 276 de la pièce Z que six copies en plus de l'original ont été produites (soit un total de sept copies - trois pour les défendeurs). Ces frais ne sont pas remboursés en l'absence d'une ordonnance relative à un deuxième ou à un troisième avocat. Les frais des copies destinées aux clients ne sont pas remboursables.
Puis, au paragraphe 152, les demandeurs soutiennent que les défendeurs ont réclamé 1 275,55 $ pour une copie supplémentaire du dossier des demandeurs et 231,54 $ pour des copies des affidavits des demandeurs; ils ajoutent qu'ils ne devraient pas avoir à payer pour des copies supplémentaires de leurs propres documents. La seule autre observation des demandeurs relative aux photocopies se trouve au paragraphe 155 de leur mémoire; il y est affirmé que la copie de dossiers de recherche non identifiés et les frais de déplacement connexes, d'un montant total de 115 $, ne devraient pas être incorporés au calcul des frais taxés.
[131]
Il est précisé au paragraphe 85 de la réponse des défendeurs que les réclamations relatives aux photocopies sont étayées par des factures, que deux avocats étaient inscrits au dossier et que chacun d'eux avait besoin d'une copie des documents. En ce qui a trait à la photocopie de documents de recherche non identifiés, l'avocate soutient que les dossiers de recherche étaient composés de copies de versions antérieures des lois et règlements pertinents de même que de comptes rendus de débats de la Chambre des communes.
[132]
Après examen de la preuve des défendeurs relative aux photocopies, présentée dans l'affidavit de Tabatha Potts, j'ai confirmé que tous les montants réclamés sont étayés par des factures établies par des fournisseurs de services externes.
[133]
En ce qui a trait à la demande des défendeurs relative à la photocopie de leur dossier de demande, aucune jurisprudence n'a été déposée pour étayer l'affirmation des demandeurs selon laquelle les coûts de photocopie d'un dossier de demande pour le second avocat ne sont pas admissibles, sauf si la Cour adjuge les dépens pour le second avocat aux termes de l'article 14b). De plus, j'estime que l'affirmation des défendeurs selon laquelle deux avocats qui travaillent sur le même dossier ont besoin d'une copie de tous les documents est raisonnable dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire comme celui de l'espèce. Dans ces circonstances, je conclus qu'il était raisonnable et nécessaire que les défendeurs produisent six copies de leur dossier de demande.
[134]
Concernant la copie supplémentaire des affidavits des demandeurs et de leur dossier de demande, je tire la même conclusion. De plus, en ce qui concerne le dossier de demande, il est indiqué à la page 279 de l'affidavit de Tabatha Potts que la copie a été produite à partir d'un disque compact (CD). J'estime raisonnable de produire une copie papier d'un document enregistré sur un CD; ces débours, au montant réclamé de 1 275,55 $, sont donc jugés admissibles. Par ailleurs, en ce qui a trait aux affidavits des demandeurs, il est précisé, à la page 172 de l'affidavit de Mme Potts, que deux copies des documents ont été produites. J'estime qu'une seule copie supplémentaire est justifiée pour le second avocat; par conséquent, ces débours sont jugés admissibles à hauteur de 115,77 $.
[135]
En ce qui a trait à la photocopie de lois, de règlements et de comptes rendus des débats de la Chambre des communes jugés pertinents, j'ai pris connaissance de la preuve qui figure à la pièce Z de l'affidavit de Tabatha Potts et je conclus que la portion réclamée pour les déplacements ne peut pas être autorisée étant donné que le parajuriste n'était pas en déplacement à l'époque où la dépense a été effectuée. Par conséquent, je déduirai 25 $ des frais de déplacement.
[136]
Même si les demandeurs n'ont fourni aucune observation quant aux photocopies liées aux requêtes, comme j'ai conclu qu'aucuns frais relatifs à une requête, quelle qu'elle soit, n'étaient admissibles, j'estime être dans l'impossibilité d'accepter les coûts des photocopies liées aux requêtes. M'appuyant sur la justification des débours et les notes qui figurent à la pièce B de l'affidavit de Tabatha Potts, j'ai éliminé tous les débours relatifs aux requêtes. De plus, comme il est mentionné au paragraphe 101 des présents motifs, le coût de la photocopie des affidavits du Dr Silverstone a été soustrait du montant à réclamer pour les débours relatifs aux photocopies. Enfin, étant donné que les demandeurs ne se sont pas opposés aux autres montants réclamés pour les photocopies, ces derniers sont acceptés tels qu'ils ont été présentés dans le mémoire de dépens des défendeurs. Par conséquent, pour les motifs susmentionnés, la demande des défendeurs relative aux frais de photocopie est accueillie à hauteur de 9 741,37 $.
Messagerie
[137]
Les défendeurs ont réclamé des frais de messagerie de 1 663,26 $. Pour justifier ce montant, les défendeurs soutiennent que les débours étaient raisonnables et nécessaires étant donné le volume des documents en cause et l'éloignement géographique des parties. À l'appui de leurs observations, les défendeurs ont invoqué la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[traduction] Même si certains débours peuvent être considérés comme des frais généraux de bureau normaux, j'estime que les frais d'envoi par télécopieur et de messagerie ne se retrouvent pas dans cette catégorie parce qu'ils peuvent être attribués à un dossier en particulier. Dans sa réponse, l'intimée soutient que l'ensemble des photocopies et des envois par messagerie et télécopieur étaient nécessaires en vue de la présentation de la requête. J'ai passé en revue le dossier et les documents déposés à l'appui de la requête en radiation de l'avis d'appel et je souligne que les avocats de la partie défenderesse exercent en Colombie-Britannique et que l'avocat de l'appelante exerce en Ontario, ce qui entraîne une augmentation des frais de télécopie et de messagerie: j'en conclus que les débours relatifs aux photocopies et aux envois par télécopieur et par messagerie sont raisonnables et nécessaires. Par conséquent, les débours réclamés par l'intimée sont acceptés.
[138]
En réponse, les demandeurs invoquent la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 158, à l'appui de l'allégation selon laquelle ils ne devraient pas être responsables des frais de messagerie pour des livraisons au client des défendeurs alors que le courrier ordinaire aurait suffi.
[139]
En réponse, les défendeurs soutiennent que les frais de messagerie sont raisonnables étant donné les lieux où se trouvaient les parties et les clients.
[140]
J'ai pris connaissance de la preuve des défendeurs et je conclus que les débours relatifs aux envois par messagerie sont accompagnés de toutes les pièces justificatives pertinentes. Cependant, pour les autres débours, je conclus que les frais de messagerie associés à des requêtes ne peuvent pas être autorisés. De plus, comme il a été mentionné au paragraphe 101 des présents motifs, le coût de l'envoi par messagerie des affidavits du Dr Silverstone a été soustrait de la somme réclamée pour les débours liés aux envois par messagerie. Enfin, en ce qui a trait à l'allégation des demandeurs selon laquelle ils ne pouvaient pas être tenus responsables des envois par messagerie au client des défendeurs, je souligne la remarque suivante formulée dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée:
[...] La preuve indique que du matériel a été préparé pour des avocats dans plus d'une ville parce que Gowlings est un cabinet d'avocats national: ces frais ne devraient pas être imposés aux demandeurs. Les réclamations de 26,62 $ et de 86,15 $ (frais postaux), comparativement aux montants élevés réclamés pour les services de messagerie et les envois par télécopieur, démontrent qu'on n'a pas tenté de trouver les solutions les mieux adaptées et les plus économiques pour l'ensemble des débours. Les défendeurs Seed Hawk ont le droit d'avoir recours aux services d'avocats exerçant leurs activités dans de nombreuses villes, mais les frais connexes et supplémentaires, c'est-à-dire transmission de télécopies par interurbain, etc., n'incombent pas aux demandeurs. De plus,
même si les communications avec le client peuvent se justifier, rien ne montre que l'utilisation du courrier ordinaire n'aurait pas suffi.
[...] (non souligné dans l'original)
Même si la preuve des défendeurs qui justifie le caractère nécessaire de l'envoi de documents d'un avocat à un client par messagerie est limitée, le montant total des envois par messagerie au client est de 121,35 $ pour les neuf années du litige. Étant donné que les avocats et le client se trouvaient dans deux villes différentes, à Edmonton et à Ottawa, j'estime que les débours étaient raisonnables et nécessaires dans le cadre du litige. Pour les motifs susmentionnés, les débours de messagerie sont autorisés à hauteur de 993,45 $.
Recherches dans les palais de justice
[141]
Les derniers débours auxquels les demandeurs se sont opposés sont mentionnés au paragraphe 154 de leur mémoire; ils ont trait à une recherche non justifiée dans un palais de justice de l'Alberta; le montant réclamé est de 170 $. Il est précisé au paragraphe 87 des observations en réponse des défendeurs que la recherche dans le palais de justice concerne un dossier soulevé par l'avocat des demandeurs lors du contre-interrogatoire du Dr Silverstone.
[142]
Même si le reçu fourni par les défendeurs ne contient aucun renseignement détaillé sur l'objet de la recherche, étant donné les observations de l'avocate des défendeurs selon lesquelles la recherche avait trait à un dossier mentionné par les demandeurs, j'estime qu'il était raisonnable que les défendeurs effectuent une recherche dans le cadre du présent litige. Par conséquent, les débours sont acceptés au montant réclamé de 170 $.
[143]
Étant donné que les montants réclamés pour des recherches sur des entreprises et les frais payés à la Cour fédérale aux termes du tarif A n'ont pas été contestés, ils sont acceptés intégralement et s'élèvent respectivement à 6 $ et 2 743,75 $.
[144]
Enfin, en ce qui concerne le mémoire de dépens complémentaire des défendeurs déposé le 4 juillet 2013, à l'audience de taxation, l'avocat des demandeurs a déclaré que ses clients n'alléguaient pas que les débours réclamés étaient déraisonnables.
[145]
J'ai pris connaissance du mémoire de dépens complémentaire des défendeurs dans lequel des débours pour frais de messagerie et de photocopie sont réclamés au regard de la taxation des dépens et je conclus que les débours réclamés sont raisonnables et nécessaires vu la complexité de la présente taxation. Par conséquent, les débours réclamés sont acceptés intégralement.
[146]
Pour les motifs susmentionnés, le mémoire de dépens révisé des défendeurs est accueilli et taxé au montant de 127 487,18 $, et le mémoire de dépens complémentaire des défendeurs est accueilli et taxé au montant de 822,27 $. Je délivrerai un certificat de taxation séparé pour chaque mémoire de dépens.
