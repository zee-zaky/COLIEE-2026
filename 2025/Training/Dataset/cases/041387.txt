[1]
de Montigny, J.
[Translation]: On June 1, 2010, the Attorney General of Canada filed in the Federal Court a notice of application, pursuant to section 38.04(1) of the
Canada Evidence Act
(
CEA
), for an order with respect to the disclosure of certain excerpts in 31 documents. Said documents were to be included in the tribunal record in respect of which the two applications for judicial review filed by the respondent were made, as required by Rule 318 of the
Federal Courts Rules
.
[2]
The disclosure of the information contained in these 31 documents to the respondent was denied following notice to the Attorney General under subsections 38.01(1) and (3), as provided in subsection 38.02(1)(
a
) of the
CEA
. The Attorney General sought to have the prohibition confirmed by the Court or, alternatively, to have the Court exercise its discretion under subsection 38.06(2) to authorize the disclosure, subject to any conditions that the judge considers appropriate to limit any injury to international relations or national defence or national security. The respondent obviously objected to the request and sought to obtain the disclosure, of all or at the very least part, of the information the Attorney General sought to protect.
[3]
These reasons follow a public hearing of both parties, followed by an
ex parte
and
in camera
hearing of the applicant and his witnesses attended by two
amici curiae
appointed by the Court. These reasons set out the history of the proceedings, of the arguments raised by the parties and the
amici
and the legal principles that guided me in the processing of this application. They are accompanied by a confidential order setting out my specific findings concerning the information for which non-disclosure was sought.
History of the proceedings
[4]
The respondent was born on September 1982 in Saudi Arabia. Being a citizen of Palestine, he is considered to be stateless; he became a permanent resident of Canada on January 21, 2004. On June 4, 2008, he was denied the right to board an Air Canada flight to Saudi Arabia, where he was apparently going to retain his permanent resident status in that country. In so doing, the respondent was given a copy of an Emergency Direction dated June 4, 2008, stating that the Department of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities (the Minister) had determined that he posed an immediate threat to aviation security.
[5]
That decision gave rise to the first application for judicial review, filed by the respondent on June 19, 2008 (docket T-973-08). The respondent challenged the decision to add his name to the Specified Persons List (SPL) as part of the Passenger Protect Program, the Emergency Direction issued under section 4.76 of the
Aeronautics Act
. In the context of the application, the respondent also challenged the constitutional validity of the at-risk persons list, of Transport Canada's Passenger Protect Program, and the above provision of the
Aeronautics Act
on the ground that these instruments are contrary to sections 6, 7 and 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
.
[6]
On June 24, 2008, a lawyer from the Department of Justice in Montréal gave to the Attorney General the notice prescribed by subsection 38.01(1) of the
CEA
. The notice issued was for seven (7) documents. As a result, on July 30, 2008, Transport Canada sent a record to the respondent from which these seven documents were excluded, and subsequently sent these documents to the respondent after having redacted them. In the face of Transport Canada's refusal to send him the full record to which he claimed to have a right of access, the respondent filed a request to obtain full disclosure of the record concerning him, under Rule 317 of the
Federal Courts Rules
. Seized with this request, Justice Frenette denied the request in a decision rendered on November 27, 2008, and ordered a stay of proceedings to allow the Attorney General to file a notice of application pursuant to section 38 of the
CEA
, so the matter of whether the sensitive or potentially injurious information referred to in the notice under subsection 38.01(1) could be dealt with in a separate proceeding, pursuant to section 38.04 of the
CEA
. The respondent appealed that decision, but discontinued his appeal on September 22, 2009.
[7]
At the same time as the first application for judicial review, the respondent filed an emergency request for reconsideration with Transport Canada's Office of Reconsideration (the Office) on June 6, 2008. On October 29, 2008, the Office recommended that the Deputy Minister declare that the decision to put the respondent's name on the SPL and to issue an Emergency Direction was void and of no effect. Accordingly, the Office recommended that the respondent's name be removed from the SPL. The respondent was only informed of that recommendation in June 2009; no information was provided to the Court as to why it took that long to advise him of this decision.
[8]
On September 10, 2009, the Deputy Minister of Transport decided not to follow the Office's recommendation and concluded that he had reasonable suspicion that the respondent may pose a threat to aviation. He accordingly decided to keep the respondent's name on the SPL.
[9]
Following this new decision, on October 14, 2009, the respondent filed a second application for judicial review (docket T-1696-09).
[10]
On April 8, 2010, an "official" within the meaning of subsection 38.01(3) of the
CEA
notified the Attorney General that sensitive information or potentially injurious information could be disclosed in the course of a proceeding. Said notice involved information contained in the 31 documents. On April 15, 2010, the Attorney General authorized the full disclosure of the seven documents and the disclosure of a redacted version of the other 24 documents; the respondent received said documents on May 7, 2010.
[11]
On April 23, 2010, the Chief Justice ordered that the two applications for judicial review proceed simultaneously and that Transport Canada's record be transmitted to the Registry, including the documents in their redacted form. Justice Frenette's order was also stayed, and it was decided that the timelines and proceedings associated with an application under section 38 of the
CEA
be the subject of a case management conference.
[12]
On June 1, 2010, the Attorney General filed his application for non-disclosure pursuant to subsection 38.04(1) of the
CEA
for the two applications for judicial review. Subsequently, on June 21, 2010, the Attorney General filed a copy of the public affidavit of "Eric", an employee of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (the Service) in support of his application. On August 27, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to strike said affidavit which was dismissed on December 22, 2010. This affidavit was to ultimately be replaced by an identical affidavit sworn by another employee of the Service, Robert Young. The affidavit explains in general terms the Service's mandate, the reasons that the Service's investigations must remain secret and the various categories of information the disclosure of which, in the Service's view, would be injurious to Canada's national security.
[13]
Pursuant to an order of the Chief Justice rendered on June 22, 2010, Mr. Al Telbani was named by the Court as respondent in the present case, by virtue of his being a party whose interests are affected by the information for which the Attorney General seeks a non-disclosure order.
[14]
On November 10, 2010, the Court ordered the appointment of two counsel as
amici curiae
(the
amici
) in this case, François Dadour and Sylvain Lussier. The normal course of proceedings was however interrupted by the motion filed by the respondent on February 17, 2011, seeking payment of his costs from the applicant. The undersigned dismissed the motion on July 27, 2011, and the appeal from that decision was dismissed on June 20, 2012. Following a direction issued by this Court on April 4, 2013, setting the time limits for the prosecution of this case, the Attorney General filed his public affidavit on May 6, 2013, and the respondent filed his own affidavit on May 31, 2013.
[15]
The public hearing of both parties was held in Montréal on October 15, 2013. Discussions subsequently ensued between the
amici
and counsel for the Attorney General regarding the information in respect of which non-disclosure is sought by the Attorney General. The
amici
made various proposals to which counsel for the Attorney General responded. At the end of that process, which occurred over a period of a few months, 16 of the 31 documents containing information the Attorney General seeks to protect were the subject of a common position between counsel for the Attorney General and the
amici
. As for the other 15 documents, they were the subject of a partial agreement: the
amici
and the Attorney General agreed that certain information should be protected, but disagreed about other information.
[16]
Following that process, an
ex parte
and
in camera
hearing was held in Ottawa on April 3, 4 and 11, 2014. On that occasion, the Attorney General called the two witnesses who swore secret affidavits in support of the application for non-disclosure, and the
amici
were able to conduct their cross-examination. The
amici
then filed their submissions, on the basis of the written submissions they had previously filed with the Court and served on the applicant, and counsel for the Attorney General did the same, also on the basis of the written submissions filed earlier with the Court and served on the
amici
.
Issues
[17]
The central question raised by this application is, of course, whether the prohibition to disclose the information identified by the Attorney General, as provided for in paragraph 38.02(1)(
a
) of the
CEA
, must be confirmed by this Court pursuant to subsection 38.06(3), or whether the disclosure must be authorized, in full or subject to certain conditions, pursuant to subsections 38.06(1) or (2).
[18]
The
amici
however raised a few preliminary questions about their role and function, about the limited nature of the main piece of information in issue and about the uncertainty arising from the current lack of alternative to the non-disclosure of the disputed information in the underlying proceeding. I will deal with the last two questions as part of my summary of the principles that will guide me in reviewing the Attorney General's application, while addressing the role of the
amici
in the introduction to my remarks.
The legal framework
[19]
It is certainly not necessary to reiterate that the open court principle is a fundamental principle of our legal system. The restrictions on this principle by Parliament and the case law have been carefully delineated, and arise from the balancing sometimes required to take into account other important interests to protect, such as informant privilege, or to protect the right of an individual to a fair hearing: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Charkaoui (Re)
, 2008 FC 61;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[20]
Sections 38 and seq of the
CEA
create another restriction on the open court principle. Section 38.01 requires every participant, as well as all officials, other than a participant, to notify the Attorney General of the possibility of disclosure of sensitive or potentially injurious information. The Attorney General of Canada shall, within 10 days after the day on which he or she receives a notice, make a decision with respect to disclosure of the information (section 38.03(3)). In the event that the Attorney General does not unconditionally authorize the disclosure of information and no disclosure agreement is entered into, the disclosure issue may come before the Federal Court (section 38.04). Such an application does not constitute a judicial review of the Attorney General's decision; the designated judge seized of the application must rather determine whether or not the prohibition to disclose the information sought to be protected should be confirmed.
[21]
The relevant provisions of the
CEA
in this regard are reproduced in Appendix A, namely, 38.01(1) and (3), 38.02(1), 38.03, 38.031, 38.04, 38.06.
[22]
In the exercise of his or her powers under sections 38 et seq of the
CEA
, the designated judge applies the tests developed by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The judge must first determine whether or not the information sought to be disclosed is relevant to the proceedings in which it is intended to be used. The applicant for disclosure bears that burden. If the judge is satisfied that the information is relevant, the judge must then determine whether disclosure of that information would be injurious to international relations, national defence or national security. At this stage, the Attorney General must prove the potential injury if disclosure of the information were to be ordered. Finally, if satisfied that disclosure of the sensitive information would result in injury, the judge must determine whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance the public interest in non-disclosure. The burden of proving that the public interest scale is tipped in favour of disclosure rests with the party seeking it. This three step test was adopted by this Court in a number of cases (see,
inter alia
,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), and the parties agree on its application in the present application.
Analysis
[23]
As noted above, I will now address the role of the
amici
in this proceeding, before turning to consider the principles that will guide me in reviewing the Attorney General's application for an order.
- The role of the
amici
in this proceeding
[24]
The
amici
argued, in their written submissions, that the mandate and responsibilities vested in them leads them to playing a [Translation] "role opposite" to that of the public department. During the hearing, they went even further by asserting that the interests of the
amici
and those of counsel for the respondent converge as they are equally [Translation] "adversaries" of the Attorney General. They rely on the wording of the order ordering their appointment, particularly their power to "cross-examine" the applicant's affiants and witnesses, as well as the need for a [Translation] "robust" system to ensure a just determination of the issues as part of an
in camera
and
ex parte
proceeding.
[25]
This understanding of the role the
amici
are called upon to play in proceedings conducted under section 38 of the
CEA
, at least in the context of an underlying civil proceeding, is erroneous in my view. Although the perception of their role did not have a significant impact on the conduct of this matter where the
amici
discharged the mandate given to them by in strict accordance with the terms of the order, it is nevertheless important to note the spirit in which they must normally approach their functions.
[26]
Sections 38 et seq of the
CEA
do not explicitly provide for the possibility for the Court to appoint an
amicus
. However, it is well established that the Court may, on its own initiative, appoint an
amicus
when entertaining an application under section 38 of the
CEA
:
Harkat (Re)
, 2004 FC 1717, at paragraph 20. Chief Justice Lutfy also indicated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (at paragraph 57) that the judge's discretion to appoint an
amicus
for the purposes of an application under section 38 contributed to assuring adherence to the principles of fundamental justice in the national security context. Indeed, the Attorney General did not contest the appointment of the two
amici
in this case and agreed at the outset with such an appointment.
[27]
That said, there is no precise definition of the role of
amicus
that is applicable to all possible situations where a court may find it beneficial to obtain advice from a lawyer not acting on behalf of the parties:
R v Cairenius
(2008), 232 CCC(3d) 13, at paragraphs 52-59;
R v Samra
(1998), 41 O.R.(3d) 434 (C.A). It is generally agreed that the appointment of an
amicus
is generally intended to represent interests that are not represented before the court, to inform the court of certain factors it would not otherwise be aware of, or to advise the court on a question of law: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 505 (BCCA).
[28]
There is no doubt, however, that the
amicus
is not the accused's lawyer (in a criminal proceeding) or respondent (in a civil proceeding). The role of an
amicus
is not any more analogous to that of a special advocate appointed under section 83 of the IRPA in the context of a security certificate. The role of the
amicus
is to assist the court and ensure the proper administration of justice, and the sole [Translation] "client" of the
amicus
is the court or the judge that appointed him or her. As Justice Fish (speaking on behalf of the dissenting judges) pointed out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (at paragraph 87), "[o] nce appointed, the amicus is bound by a duty of loyalty and integrity to the court and not to any of the parties to the proceedings".
[29]
It cannot be otherwise if the
amicus
is to be able to fully carry out the role assigned to him or her. Indeed, it is not inconceivable that he or she may be required to raise arguments or points of law that are not necessarily favourable to the accused or the respondent. Indeed, that is the reason that the Supreme Court unanimously concluded in
Criminal Lawyers' Association
that a lawyer appointed as amicus who takes on the role of defence counsel is no longer a friend of the court (see paragraphs 56 for the majority and 114 for the minority). Although the Court was divided on the issue of whether a superior court has the inherent power to set rates of remuneration for amici, all the judges considered that the role of an
amicus
and that of defence counsel are incompatible. I find that the same is true in a civil proceeding, although the dividing line may not always be so clear cut and the consequences of the blurring of lines may not be as dramatic.
[30]
In short, playing a role that may sometimes be opposite to that of the Attorney General does not make the
amicus
a defence counsel or counsel for the civil party. The objective of the
amicus
and the state of mind in which he or she acts is not to assume the role of an advocate for the accused or the respondent, but to provide the Court with insight that it would not otherwise obtain and to assist it in making a decision that is in the best interests of justice. The fact that these interests may converge in certain circumstances does not change anything and merely represents, in a manner of speaking, a marginal benefit resulting from the appointment of
amicus
. He or she must therefore act at all times with transparency, without ever attempting to take counsel for the Attorney General by surprise. The tactics and strategies that defence counsel, and even, in certain circumstances, a special advocate, may properly use are misplaced in a proceeding under section 38 of the
CEA
.
[31]
That said, the role of the
amicus
in such a proceeding may be modulated by the judge who appoints him or her to take into account the unique nature of an application under section 38 of the
CEA
. The very nature of the information to which the
amicus
will have access, the seriousness of the issues raised by the balancing of national security and the fairness of the proceedings, and the degree of transparency with which the Attorney General as well as the witnesses called in support of the application discharge their duties, are factors that may lead an
amicus
to play a more or less interventionist role depending on the circumstances.
[32]
In closing, I note that the order dated November 10, 2010, was entirely clear and left no doubt as to the role the
amici
were called upon to play. It ordered that Mr. Dadour and Mr. Lussier be appointed [Translation] "to act as
amici curiae
in this proceeding to assist the Court in preparation for the
in camera
hearings and intervene in those same hearings", and that they could not communicate with the respondent or his counsel from the moment they had access to confidential material and information. As for the power to cross-examine the applicant's affiants and witnesses, it is a clause found in all the orders issued by this Court in similar cases. Again, the object of such cross-examinations is not to advocate for the respondent and embrace his interests as if the
amicus
had a solicitor-client relationship with the respondent, but rather to verify the reliability and the probative value of the evidence filed by the applicant and the strength of his arguments.
[33]
The Court was obviously not a party to the discussions between counsel for the Attorney General and the
amici
regarding the disclosure of information contained in the 31 documents in issue in this application. Clearly, these discussions were successful to the extent that an agreement was concluded on much of the information for which non-disclosure was sought. It is undoubtedly useful for the Court (and perhaps for the Attorney General as well) to know prior to the
ex parte
and
in camera
hearing the reasons underlying the position of the
amici
when there is disagreement between them. That said, the position of the Attorney General is no more explicit and is solely based, for each piece of information, on xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx generically representing the basis for the exclusion sought. In short, I find nothing objectionable about the manner in which the
amici
discharged their duty, and further, I do not consider that they ought to have sought the Court's permission before filing their preliminary submissions in writing. This was authorized by order dated November 10, 2010, and their memorandum was submitted to the Attorney General almost a month before the hearing.
[34]
With these clarifications in mind, I now turn to the three-step test developed by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
(a) Relevancy of the information sought in the application for non-disclosure
[35]
As mentioned above, the Attorney General's application for an order under section 38.06(3) of the
CEA
only pertains to a limited number of documents (31). Furthermore, non-disclosure is not sought for the documents in full but only for portions of these documents. Finally, it is important to note that several documents are redundant or contain the same information, which limits even more the amount of information being sought to be protected.
[36]
Sixteen of the thirty-one documents for which an application for non-disclosure has been filed were the subject of a total agreement between counsel for the Attorney General and the
amici
. Although said agreement is not binding on the Court, it will nonetheless be of keen interest when the time comes to determine whether the non-disclosure of certain information claimed by the Attorney General is justified or not. It must be said that the redacted information in the sixteen documents is not really relevant for the purposes of the underlying judicial reviews to the extent that it essentially reveals the names of certain employees of the Service as well as operational telephone numbers that are not known to the public. In one document, the redacted information is related to a file xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxxxxx whereas in another document, the information could reveal the success or failure of an investigation. Indeed, the only information appearing in a few of these sixteen documents (as well as in other documents on which a comprehensive agreement was not reached) that could potentially be of some use to the respondent was obtained from third parties. I will have an opportunity to explain my reasoning a little later.
[37]
There are therefore only fifteen documents that are not the subject of a common position in their entirety between counsel for the Attorney General and the
amici
. Once again, it must be reiterated that the Attorney General is not seeking the non-disclosure of the fifteen documents in full but only certain portions (more or less substantial) of these documents. However, the disagreement between counsel for the Attorney General and the
amici
is not over all the excerpts sought to be protected, but only some of them.
[38]
As stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the first task of a designated judge tasked with examining an application for non-disclosure pursuant to section 38 of the
CEA
is to determine whether the information for which exclusion is sought is relevant to the underlying proceeding. Although the burden rests with the party seeking the non-disclosure, the threshold is low. In a criminal proceeding, the test of relevance will be dependent on the rule set out in
R v Stinchcombe
, [1991] 3 SCR 326, that is, that the information at issue may reasonably be useful to the defence.
[39]
The relevance test will not be the same in a civil proceeding, as was the case in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or even in an inquiry procedure (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[40]
In this case, the underlying proceedings are two judicial reviews of decisions made by Transport Canada. In this regard, it is Rule 317 of the
Federal Courts Rules
that governs relevance and determines the documents that must be produced by the tribunal whose order is the subject of judicial review. That Rule sets out that a party may request material "relevant to an application". That Rule has been given a broad interpretation to the point of encompassing any document that "may affect the decision that the Court will make on the application":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 460 (FCA). In another matter, it was concluded that a document could be relevant even if the decision-maker did not refer to it or use it in support of his or her decision:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC). That means that the obligation to present a complete record covers not only the documents before the decision-maker at the time of the decision, but also the documents that should have been before the decision-maker for the purposes of the judicial review:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[41]
In this case, the Attorney General conceded that much of the information he is seeking to protect is relevant for the purposes of the applications for judicial review filed by the respondent. At the relevance stage, only information concerning the names and contact information of certain employees of the Service, as well as internal and administrative procedures, like file numbers, are excluded. For all other information, it is necessary to proceed to the second step set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and determine whether the disclosure of that information would be injurious to national security.
(b) Identification of an injury to national security
[42]
When it is established that the information is relevant, the Attorney General bears the burden of proving that that information, if disclosed, "could injure international relations or national defence or national security", to use the words of the definition of the expression "potentially injurious information" in section 38. In this regard, the assessment made by the Attorney General will be of considerable weight given the special information and expertise to which he has access. The Court of Appeal stated the following in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (at para 19):
This means that the Attorney General's submissions regarding his assessment of the injury to national security, national defence or international relations, because of his access to special information and expertise, should be given considerable weight by the judge required to determine, pursuant to subsection 38.06(1), whether disclosure of the information would cause the alleged and feared injury. The Attorney General assumes a protective role
vis-à-vis
the security and safety of the public. If his assessment of the injury is reasonable, the judge should accept it. . . .
See also:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 64;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 70.
[43]
As a result, the Court must show deference when it is called upon to determine an application for non-disclosure under the authority of section 38 of the
CEA.
That attitude is all the more justified since the very concept of "national security" is fluid and does not lend itself to a specific definition. My colleagues Justice Mosley and Justice Noël engaged in a lengthy analysis of this concept in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and they concluded, in particular, that national security could not be limited to the preservation of national integrity or the capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, and meant, at minimum, the preservation of the Canadian way of life, including the safeguarding of the security of persons, institutions and freedoms in Canada. I agree with their comments. The difficulty in identifying exactly what constitutes a threat to national security is, in my opinion, an additional reason in favour of a fairly high degree of deference from this Court in respect of assessments carried out by government authorities. The Supreme Court stated the following in this regard in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 85:
. . . a fair, large and liberal interpretation in accordance with international norms must be accorded to "danger to the security of Canada" in deportation legislation. We recognize that "danger to the security of Canada" is difficult to define. We also accept that the determination of what constitutes a "danger to the security of Canada" is highly fact-based and political in a general sense. All this suggests a broad and flexible approach to national security and, as discussed above, a deferential standard of judicial review. Provided the Minister is able to show evidence that reasonably supports a finding of danger to the security of Canada, courts should not interfere with the Minister's decision.
[44]
That said, the Court cannot abdicate the role entrusted to it by Parliament and merely blindly endorse the applications for non-disclosure which may be filed by the Attorney General. Even though the Court must show deference, it is nonetheless entitled to expect the Attorney General to demonstrate, from the facts established by the evidence, that the alleged injury is not merely possible or speculative, but probable:
Arar
, para 49; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , para 70. In other words, it is not sufficient to speculate that a piece of information could be potentially injurious to national security; it must be established, through concrete and reliable evidence, that the injury is serious and not based on mere speculation. We are no longer in the days when courts had to comply each time a minister refused to produce a document by availing himself of Crown privilege in relation to national security. With the coming into force of section 36.2 of the
CEA
(S.C. 1980-81-82, c 111, section 4), now section 38, the Federal Court has been given the mandate to determine whether information can be disclosed under section 38.04. To fulfil this role, the Court must not only take notice of the information that the Attorney General seeks to not make public, but also verify that that information is indeed covered by the prohibition on disclosure set out in subsection 38.02(1) of the
CEA
.
[45]
It is recognized that the disclosure of certain categories of information would generally be injurious to national security. Since 1988, this Court has stated that the disclosure of information that identified or tended to identify human or technical sources, past or present investigation subjects, the nature and the content of classified information, techniques or methods of investigation or even the length, scope, success or failure of investigations, could be considered injurious to national security: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 29; see also, similarly,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  still a member of this Court, provided the following examples of information of the type that must be kept confidential:
1. Information obtained from human sources, where disclosure of the information would identify the source and put the source's life in danger . . . . As well, jeopardizing the safety of one human source will make other human sources or potential human sources hesitant to provide information if they are not assured that their identity will be protected.
2. Information obtained from agents of the Service, where the disclosure of the information would identify the agent and put the agent's life in danger.
3. Information about ongoing investigations where disclosure of the information would alert those working against Canada's interest and allow them to take evasive action.
4. Secrets obtained from foreign countries or foreign intelligence agencies where unauthorized disclosure would cause other countries or agencies to decline to entrust their own secret information to an insecure or untrustworthy recipient. . . .
5. Information about the technical means and capacities of surveillance and about certain methods or techniques of investigation of the Service where disclosure would assist persons of interest to the Service to avoid or evade detection or surveillance or the interception of information.
Harkat (Re)
, 2005 FC 393, at para 89.
[47]
In the public affidavit in support of this application for non-disclosure, Robert Young categorized the information that the Service seeks to protect according to, more or less, that classification. Two other confidential affidavits were also submitted and use that same classification by providing more specifics about the information involved. Those categories are as follows:
- Information that would identify or tend to identify the Service's interest in individuals, groups or issues, including the existence or nonexistence of past or present files, the intensity of investigations, or the degree or lack of success of investigations;
- Information that would identify or tend to identify the methods of operation and investigative techniques used by the Service;
- Information that would identify or tend to identify relationships that the Service maintains with other police and security and intelligence agencies and would disclose information exchanged in confidence with such agencies;
- Information that would identify or tend to identify the identity of certain employees, internal procedures and administrative methodologies of the Service, such as names and file numbers;
- Information that would identify or tend to identify human sources of information for the Service or the content of information provided by human sources which, if disclosed, could lead to the identification of human sources.
[48]
In the present case, and following discussions between counsel for the Attorney General and the
amici
, the only information that was not the subject of an agreement falls exclusively under the first three categories of information mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Of course, some of the information may fall under more than one category. Therefore, I will now address each of those three categories.
[49]
The Attorney General is first seeking the non-disclosure of information concerning the interest the Service might have in Mr. Al Telbani and the investigations into his activities or those of other persons with which he is or was in contact. It is true that Mr. Al Telbani is obviously aware of the Service's interest in his online activities following the interview he had with the Service on June 2, 2008, during which he was confronted with certain facts concerning the technical support he apparently provided to extremist activities. What the Service is seeking to protect is other facts that were not brought to the attention of Mr. Al Telbani and that are likely to reveal the nature and scope of the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx investigation and the resulting assessments and analyses.
[50]
There seems to be no doubt, as the witness who swore an affidavit on behalf of CSIS argued, that a security agency cannot operate effectively if the subjects of its investigations are able to ascertain that they are persons of interest or determine the state of the agency's operational knowledge about them at a particular point in time, the resulting operational evaluation and even the fact that the agency is able to make some findings regarding the targets of its investigations. The disclosure of such information would allow a person of interest to take steps to avoid the Service's investigative efforts, or even introduce false or misleading information into the investigation. The extent and reliability of the information gathered by the Service would be diminished, and its capacity to identify and deal with potential threats would be compromised.
[51]
In this case, the respondent's interview with the Service, xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xx xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx I agree with the applicant that the disclosure of the information the Service provided to Transport Canada as part of its recommendation that the respondent's name be put on the SPL would be of great help to the respondent in his alleged role of xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xx xxxx By providing him with specific information regarding the investigation xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx x xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx x x x xx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx That would have negative consequences not only for the present investigation, but also for other investigations conducted by the Service xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
[52]
In light of the foregoing, I am therefore of the view that the disclosure of all of the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx excerpts in the fifteen documents that the Attorney General and the
amici
did not fully agree upon would be injurious to national security. Of course, the real issue is whether the public interest reasons that justify disclosure outweigh in importance the public interest reasons that justify non-disclosure, and if so, under what conditions and in what medium must the information be disclosed. Before proceeding to the last step in the test, it is appropriate, however, to examine the two other categories of information for which the Attorney General is seeking non-disclosure and that were not the subject of an agreement with the
amici
.
[53]
The second category of information for which non-disclosure is sought is information that would identify or tend to identify the methods of operation and investigative techniques utilized by the Services. In this regard, the Service's affiant testified that the disclosure of that type of information would render the techniques and methods that could be utilized in the context of this investigation or investigations of other persons less effective, to the extent that the potential subjects of such investigations may be able to thwart the Service's efforts or at the very least reduce the effectiveness of current methods.
[54]
That risk is greater in this case because the respondent has completed a master's degree in information systems security. Xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xx x xxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx It is also worth noting that, according to the affiant, the respondent was visibly shaken to learn during his interview that the Service had discovered his aliases and wanted to know how they had discovered that he was "Mujahid Taqni". In this context, the Attorney General's concerns seem to me to be particularly well founded. The serious possibility that the respondent may be able to exploit the information at issue in this application to jeopardize the investigation that he or other persons could be the subject of, which would make the task of the Service and even, potentially, third parties, considerably more difficult, certainly cannot be ruled out.
[55]
Among the pieces of information sought to be protected, there is one specific piece of information that would tend to demonstrate, according to the position of the Attorney General, that the respondent constitutes a threat to aviation security. That information, which is found in various forms in several documents, xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx xx xx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx x x xxx xxxx During the
in camera
and
ex parte
hearings, the
amici
referred to that information as "the elephant in the room".
[56]
The Attorney General forcefully objects to the disclosure of that information for two reasons. He first contends that that information xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx x xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxx xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Moreover, it is argued that the disclosure of that information would enable the respondent to suspect, if not confirm, that that information xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
[57]
On cross-examination, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx acknowledged that xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx x xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxx xxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xx xx xx xx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx . xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx
[58]
Once again, the fact that the disclosure of information under that second category and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx in the impugned documents would be injurious to national security does not end the analysis that this Court must carry out under section 38 of the
CEA
. The fact that the respondent xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx will of course be an important consideration in the injury balancing step required by <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[59]
The last category of information in dispute between the Attorney General and the
amici
is information that would identify or tend to identify relationships that the Service maintains with other intelligence agencies or that would disclose or tend to disclose information exchanged in confidence with such agencies. The numerous excerpts sought to be protected under this category all contain the same information, which is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
[60]
The Attorney General argued that it was essential for the Service to cooperate with other secret services to fulfil the mandate that was conferred on it to advise the government in the fight against terrorism. This is because terrorist acts are not necessarily planned, funded, managed or executed by the residents of one country or within the borders of one State. Consequently, the only way to effectively investigate those threats to try to prevent them is to engage in close collaboration and information sharing at the international level.
[61]
That sharing of secret information by foreign intelligence agencies with which the Service has a comprehensive or ad hoc agreement is always done assuming that the source or content of the information thus obtained will not be disclosed without the consent of the agency that the information came from. It is what is sometimes called the "third party rule". It is an acknowledgment that foreign agencies provide information to the Service not only because agreements are entered into to ensure that that information will be utilized in confidence, but also because those agencies are confident that the Canadian government in general, and the Service in particular, are fully aware of and recognize the need to preserve the confidentiality of that information and have taken steps in that respect.
[62]
Of course, a failure on the part the Canadian government or the Service to protect intelligence obtained from a foreign agency could have disastrous consequences on the maintenance of existing agreements or on the Service's capacity to enter into new agreements with other foreign agencies. As has been said in numerous cases, Canada is a net importer of intelligence information, and any interruption or reduction in the exchanges of that information would adversely affect the maintenance of our collective security and the role Canada plays in the international arena in that respect.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court recognized (at paras 43 and 54) the importance of that "pressing and substantial" concern. More recently, it stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (at para 68) that Canada is a net importer of security information, that that information is "essential to the security and defence of Canada", and that its disclosure "would adversely affect its flow and quality". My colleague Justice Noël aptly summarized the importance of that rule in
Arar
, at paragraph 77 of his reasons:
This being said, in my view the third party rule is of essence to guarantee the proper functioning of modern police and intelligence agencies. This is particularly true given that organized criminal activities are not restricted to the geographic territory of a particular nation and that recent history has clearly demonstrated that the planning of terrorist activities is not necessarily done in the country where the attack is targeted so as to diminish the possibility of detection. Consequently, the need for relationships with foreign intelligence and policing agencies, as well as robust cooperation and exchanges of information between these agencies, is essential to the proper functioning of policing and intelligence agencies worldwide.

[68]
A priori
, I do not doubt that the disclosure of the information xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx would be injurious to the national interest of Canada. The case law in this area, and the secret testimony of the affiants, convinces me that the Service xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxx. This would certainly result in a diminished capacity to fulfil the mandate xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx by Parliament, in particular in the fight against terrorism in Canada and around the world.
[69]
xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx..
[70]
As important as the third party rule might be, however, it cannot be absolute. There is no statutory basis for that "rule", and the mere fact that a foreign agency did not relieve the Service (or any other Canadian agency) of its confidentiality obligation cannot suffice, on its own, to conclude that the disclosure of information thus obtained would be injurious to national security. Other factors must be considered, including the fact that the information in question was subsequently disclosed and is now in the public domain, as well as the passage of time. There must also consideration for how the sharing of information, both quantitative and qualitative, with a foreign agency might be important for Canada. My colleague, Justice Noël, stated the following in
Arar
(at para 80):
When determining whether disclosure will cause harm, it is also important to consider the nature of Canada's relationship with the law enforcement or intelligence agency from which the information was received. It is recognized that certain agencies are of greater importance to Canada and thus that more must be done to protect our relationship with them. Consequently, care must be taken when considering whether to circumvent the third party rule in what concerns information obtained from our most important allies.
[71]
In this case, xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxx x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx are critically important for Canada. I also accept the Attorney General's argument that the disclosure of information obtained from an agency with which Canada has not so critical ties could still have long-term repercussions, not only because this could cause information from that agency to dry up but also because it could discourage other agencies from maintaining or creating ties with Canada.
[72]
Another factor that must be considered, both in assessing the injury and in balancing public interests, is the Canadian government's effort (or lack of effort) to obtain the consent of a foreign agency in the disclosure of the information provided by that agency.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (reversed on other grounds by the Supreme Court), the Federal Court of Appeal seemed to be of the opinion that Canadian authorities had to make "reasonable efforts" to seek the consent of the third party agency that provided the information before finding that it would be injurious to disclose that information. See also, similarly: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 145-146;
Charkaoui (Re),
2009 FC 476, at paras 28-29.
[73]
More recently, this Court somewhat qualified that obligation. In
Arar
(at paras 75 and 94), Justice Noël stated that he was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to draw a negative conclusion from the fact that the Attorney General did not seek consent from a foreign agency to disclose information, given the fact that such authorization would have likely been refused based on the evidence in the record. Justice Mosley found that the failure to make inquiries of foreign agencies regarding the disclosure of their information was not fatal but could be taken into consideration and could undermine a privilege claim, especially when the information appears innocuous on its face. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , he nonetheless accepted the Attorney General's submissions to the effect that it would be futile to ask certain countries to consent to the disclosure of their information.
[74]
In this case, xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx x xxx, I readily accept that it is highly unlikely that such consent would have been given.
[75]
I am therefore of the opinion that the information for which non-disclosure is sought on the basis that it comes from third parties passes the second step of the test set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . That does not necessarily mean that that information must be completely removed from the record that Mr. Al Telbani has a right to in his applications for judicial review. To determine this issue, it is necessary to proceed to the third step of the test and determine which public interest prevails: the public interest in disclosure or the public interest in non-disclosure. As with the other categories of information for which non-disclosure is sought, at that step, other considerations must be taken into account, like the passage of time and the fact that some information is now in the public domain. From this perspective, there must also be an examination of the possibility of minimizing the injury that the disclosure of a piece of information could cause, by replacing, for example, an excerpt deemed too sensitive with a summary. In that regard, it would have been useful if the original document transmitted by the third parties was submitted before the Court to better compare the text to be protected with that document and thus better assess the damage that a redacted version or a summary of that text could cause. Despite the Court's request to that effect, the Attorney General did not see fit to submit the original documents provided by the third parties and it is thus with a certain disadvantage that the Court must engage in that review.
(c) Balancing public interest in disclosure and public interest in non-disclosure
[76]
Pursuant to the case law that has developed with respect to the interpretation of section 38 of the
CEA
, the party seeking disclosure bears the burden at this stage of proving that the public interest scale is tipped in its favour. If the Court is satisfied that public interest favours disclosure, subsection 38.06(2) provides for the authorization of disclosure of information in the form and under the conditions that are most likely to limit any injury to international relations or national defence or national security.
[77]
Section 38 of the
CEA
does not specify the test to apply, but of course the Court must consider several different factors that may vary from case to case. In a criminal context, the issue of whether the information at hand would likely establish a fact crucial to the defence is an important factor that must be considered when weighing the interests. This case is not of that nature as the respondent does not face criminal charges. The applications for judicial review that the respondent filed are more akin to a civil case, and in that context the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (at para 22) that it was important to apply a more stringent test than that of relevance, and that there must instead be consideration of whether the information sought would establish a fact crucial to the case of the party seeking it.
[78]
From that perspective, the courts identified several factors to consider in when weighing competing interests in disclosure and non-disclosure: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Arar
, at para 98; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 174. Although not necessarily exhaustive, this list includes, but is not limited to, the following elements:
- the nature of the public interest sought to be protected by confidentiality;
- the admissibility of the documentation, its usefulness and the probative value of the information it contains;
- the seriousness of the criminal charges or the issues raised in the underlying proceeding;
- whether the party seeking disclosure has established that there are no other reasonable ways of obtaining the information;
- whether the disclosure sought amounts to legitimate disclosure or a fishing expedition;
- whether the redacted information is already known to the public, and if so, the manner by which the information made its way into the public domain;
- whether there are higher interests at stake such as a breach of Charter rights, the right to make full answer and defence in the criminal context, etc.
[79]
Counsel for the applicant and the
amici
also argued that the stigma created by the respondent's association to a group or terrorist activities and the application of preventive measures restricting his liberty also involved rights under sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. The Attorney General argued that the ban on taking a commercial flight to which the respondent was subject did not restrict his liberty or security rights, as interpreted by the courts, given that such a ban is not akin to interference with fundamental personal choices or what constitutes the core of human dignity, or even interference with the psychological integrity of an individual. That debate has not occurred and will take place in the context of the two applications for judicial review filed by the respondent. For that reason, I decline to rule on that issue, directly or indirectly, in connection with the application for non-disclosure.
[80]
For the purposes of this discussion, suffice it to say that the Charter arguments raised by the respondent are not completely lacking in merit and cannot be dismissed out of hand. Consequently, the Court must consider them when weighing interests in this case. If the non-disclosure of certain information could compromise not only the right to procedural fairness but also the respondent's ability to assert his fundamental rights, it is an additional factor to consider.
[81]
This now leads me to consider more specifically the various pieces of information for which non-disclosure is sought and for which the Attorney General and the
amici
have not been able to find a common solution. The first document is attached to the letter from the Deputy Director of the Service to the Deputy Minister of Transport dated September 3, 2009, found at tab xx of the supplementary
ex parte
affidavit of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx. In that letter, the Deputy Director of the Service informs the Deputy Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 19 of the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
, that the Service had received information that Mr. Al Telbani may possibly be linked to criminal and terrorist activities. The information in question is appended to the letter. xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxx x
[82]
xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx x
[83]
Relying on the testimony of the witness for the Service, the Attorney General asserted three reasons to protect xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxx xxx xxxx xxx xxx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xx
[84]
However, the
amici
raised several arguments against these justifications. First they argued that the Service xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx by going to Mr. Al Telbani's home on June 2, 2008, and by calling him by his pseudonym Mujahid Taqni. Xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Mr. Al Telbani apparently confirmed that he had used this pseudonym to participate in discussions on Internet forums. Xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx x xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Mr. Al Telbani with this information and by relying xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx to thus encourage him to stop his activities, the Service ended up implicitly revealing to him their interest in him and the scope of their investigation. This seems to be a convincing argument to me.
[85]
The
amici
add that the Service also xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxx In this regard, the
amici's
argument seems less convincing. xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx
[86]
Last, the

argue xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx. xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx
[87]
However, xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx is undeniably important information in the context of the underlying judicial review. It should not be forgotten that Mr. Al Telbani is challenging the Minister's decision to put his name on the Specified Persons List (SPL) on the grounds that he posed a threat to aviation safety. Xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx.
[88]
It is true that Mr. Al Telbani is aware of some of the information relied upon to add his name to the SPL, as the Attorney General contended. The letter that the Assistant Deputy Minister of Safety and Security of Transport to his counsel on June 10, 2009, set out the factors that would be considered in Mr. Al Telbani's request for reconsideration:

• That your client provided technical support to participants on the Al Ekhlas Internet site to maintain the security of their communications by evading surveillance systems.
• That your client, using the pseudonym "Mujahid Taqni", participated in discussions on various Internet sites regarding the protection of communications from surveillance systems.
• That the purpose of the discussions and activities of the Internet discussion forums is to support "mujahedeen" terrorists who fight against European and North American countries.
• That your client created and managed an electronic journal "Mujahid Taqni", published on the Al Ekhlas site, specialized in sharing information on important topics for "mujahedeen" terrorists such as how to protect communications against surveillance systems and how to commit terrorist acts especially in relation to aviation safety.
[89]
This information, which stems largely from the interview that the Service had with Mr. Al Telbani a year earlier, does not clearly link Mr. Al Telbani to a threat to aviation safety. The only link to this concern in the public evidence can be found in an article published in the February 20, 2007, edition of the magazine
Al-mujahid taqni
, which the respondent is the editor of, entitled "Smart weapons: Short-range ground-to-air missiles" (Respondent's Record, page 244.12).
[90]
It goes without saying that the fact xxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxx is not enough to say that the principle of procedural fairness was respected and to enable him to advance all the arguments likely to help him succeed in his challenge to the legality of Transport Canada's decision. We cannot require the respondent to speculate on the grounds that resulted in the decision to put his name on the SPL or insist that he blindly try to rebut all the facts that could be raised against him.
[91]
Thus, I believe that xxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx is not only relevant information but potentially extremely significant information to establish the legality of the decision challenged by Mr. Al Telbani. It is quite possible, as the Attorney General argued, that the information on the public record is enough to establish that Transport Canada's decision was reasonable. It is also possible that the information sought to be excluded may in the end be more damaging to the respondent than the applicant in the context of the judicial review. It is not for me to rule on these issues. For the purposes of the application in these proceedings, I merely have to find that non-disclosure xx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxx could materially affect the outcome of the judicial review and deprive Mr. Al Telbani of an important argument.
[92]
The
amici
brought to the Court's attention a decision by the European Court of Justice on the compatibility of a control order (similar to our security certificates) with the guarantee of procedural fairness set out in article 6 of the
European Convention on Human Rights
. In that case, the Court observed that the issue of whether the evidence provided to the individual was sufficiently detailed to permit the applicant effectively to challenge the order must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, the Court expressed the opinion that the requirements of procedural fairness would not be met where the open material consisted purely of general assertions and the decision to uphold the certification was based solely or to a decisive degree on closed material:
A. and Others v the United Kingdom
(application No 3455/05), February 19, 2009, at para 220.
[93]
Although this decision obviously does not bind our Court and it applies to a very different legal context, it still makes some interesting observations. As the Court pointed out, an individual does not need to know the detail or sources of the evidence which formed the basis of the decision. It is necessary, however, for the individual to have enough information about the allegations against him to be able to raise arguments that may refute the allegations. In this case, Mr. Al Telbani does not have any idea of the allegations against him involving aviation safety other than the very vague allegation in the above-mentioned letter from the Assistant Deputy Minister stating that he "created and managed an electronic journal ... specialized in sharing information on important topics for "mujahedeen" terrorists such as ... how to commit terrorist acts especially in relation to aviation safety". It is hard to see how, based on only this information, Mr. Al Telbani could challenge the decision to put him on the SPL by providing, for example, explanations about xx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxx.
[94]
Does this mean that this information has to be disclosed to him? Far from it. The courts have stated many times that procedural fairness does not always require complete disclosure of the evidence and the requirements of the principles of fundamental justice should be interpreted according to the context and do not require that the applicant have the most favourable proceedings: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 39 et seq. In the instant case, the issue of the underlying proceeding is not of the same magnitude as the deprivation of liberty following a criminal conviction or the issuance of a security certificate. Although I am not playing down the impact of a ban on taking a commercial flight and I do not exclude the possibility that such a ban could engage section 7 of the Charter, nevertheless, it seems to me that the public interest in disclosure in that situation should be secondary to the public interest in not revealing information that could have devastating repercussions on national security. As Justice McKay stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (at paragraph 32), "The public interest served by maintaining secrecy in the national security context is weighty. In the balancing of public interest here at play, that interest would only be outweighed in a clear and compelling case for disclosure". It seems to me that this finding is even more applicable since the role of the judge ruling on an application for judicial review is quite different from the role of a judge hearing a criminal case or a claim for civil relief. I will return to this aspect of the issue later.
[95]
Several of the documents that are requested to be redacted contain a summary of the document xx or refer to the fact xxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx The
amici
suggested partially removing the redaction of those passages, such that the fact that Mr. Al Telbani xxxxx xx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx would be redacted. It seems to me that this option should be avoided to the extent that Mr. Al Telbani xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxx.
[96]
The
amici
stated that this information could have been obtained xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxx But since Mr. Al Telbani was interviewed by the Service, xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx x xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxx
[97]
The second category of information that is sought to be protected, xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxx xx xxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxx xx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx x x x xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx
[98]
The grounds raised for non-disclosure of that information is based on the same logic as that given for excluding document xx. In both cases disclosing the information would enable Mr. Al Telbani xx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx Given the importance of protecting the Service's investigative techniques, and despite the relevance of this information in determining the legality or illegality of Transport Canada's decision to put his name on the SPL, I am of the opinion that this information should be protected and that no summary could minimize the injury to national security. Consequently, I find that the redaction of this information in documents 6, 8, 9, 14, 16, 18, 23, 27, 28, 29 and 30 should be maintained.
[99]
The last two pieces of information that the Attorney General seeks to protect come from third parties. The first was apparently sent to the Service by xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxx. The second piece of information was provided to the Service by xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx.
[100]
The witness for the Service conceded that the key points of this information appeared in various places in the public record, particularly in the letter signed by the Assistant Deputy Minister of Safety and Security of Transport the relevant excepts of which I reproduced above (paragraph 88). This information can also be found, although in a different form, in the summary of the Service's interview with Mr. Al Telbani, as well as in one of the on-line magazines that is part of the public record, The Technical Mujahid, published by the Al-Fajr Media Center, described as "Al-Qaida's official online logistical network". However, it was argued that the information for which non-disclosure is sought is xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
[101]
It is true that the name of the third parties involved do not appear anywhere in the excerpts that are sought to be protected. Moreover, the witness for the admitted that they had not tried to ask the third parties to consent to the disclosure of this information. Last, Mr. Al Telbani is aware of the information and it is not different from information that is already in the public domain; indeed the letter from the Assistant Deputy Minister of Safety and Security of Transport Canada essentially repeats this information. Xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx Moreover, the non-disclosure of this information would not be injurious to Mr. Al Telbani and would not prevent him from effectively challenging the decisions that are the object of the two applications for judicial review underlying this proceeding, since he is now aware of this through other sources (particularly following the letter from the Assistant Deputy Minister). Under these circumstances, and given the importance to Canada's national security of protecting the confidentiality of information provided to the Service by third parties, I believe that the application for non-disclosure of this information should be allowed.
[102]
Xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xx x xxxxx xxxxxxxxxx. For all these reasons, I believe that the injury to national security in disclosing information provided by third parties outweighs the injury to the open court principle and a person's right to fully present his or her case.
[103]
Before concluding these reasons, we should discuss the option raised by the
amici
and the Attorney General to minimize the injury to Mr. Al Telbani caused by the non-disclosure of information under this application by authorizing its disclosure to the judge who will be hearing the two applications for judicial review. Although they recognize that such a process may have some support in the case law, the
amici
contended that the Court probably does not have the jurisdiction to order such a measure. The Attorney General, clearly stated that he preferred to obtain a solid non-disclosure order but that he was not opposed to allowing a designated judge who was hearing the applications for judicial review to consult the secret evidence and even having the support of an
amicus
to help him or her in this task.
[104]
This is the first time that such an approach has been considered quite simply because it is the first time that an application for non-divulgation based on section 38 of the
CEA
is linked to a legal proceeding that will be heard on its merits by a judge of our Court. Unlike the situation of a criminal or civil proceeding heard by a provincial court (superior or inferior) whose judges are not allowed to access information that is potentially injurious to national security, there is nothing preventing a judge hearing an application for judicial review of a decision by a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" within the meaning of section 18.1 of the
Federal
Courts Act
from being a designated judge under section 38 of the
CEA
. Does this mean that this could be a measure to minimize injury that can be considered in the balancing exercise prescribed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ?
[105]
In criminal matters, section 38.14 of the
CEA
authorizes a court to make any order deemed appropriate in the circumstances to protect the right of the accused to a fair trial. This provision, which no doubt was necessary to maintain the constitutionality of the regime established under sections 38 et seq of the
CEA
, allows the trial judge to dismiss specified counts of the indictment or information or order a stay of the proceedings. However, to prevent such measures from being taken for no reason and prevent judges from wrongly ruling that the fairness of the trial would be compromised because he or she is dealing with an incomplete file, Parliament provided a mechanism allowing disclosure of information that could be useful to ensure a fair trial to the trial judge. As the Supreme Court stated in
R v Ahmad
, at para 31:
We must presume that Parliament was aware of the possibility that proceedings would be needlessly stayed if the trial judge was denied access to material that could not be disclosed for valid reasons of state secrecy. In light of the vast resources expended in investigating and prosecuting offences that implicate national security and the injustice to society that would result if such prosecutions were needlessly derailed, this cannot have been Parliament's intention.
[106]
The mechanism that provides some flexibility in the application of section 38 can be found at subsection 38.06(2) of the
CEA
, which reads as follows:
If the judge concludes that the disclosure of the information or facts would be injurious to international relations or national defence or national security but that the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance the public interest in non-disclosure, the judge may by order, after considering both the public interest in disclosure and the form of and conditions to disclosure that are most likely to limit any injury to international relations or national defence or national security resulting from disclosure, authorize the disclosure, subject to any conditions that the judge considers appropriate, of all or part of the information or facts, a summary of the information or a written admission of facts relating to the information.
[107]
Furthermore, this approach was borrowed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In this case, my colleague Justice Mosley exceptionally provided counsel for the parties with a summary of the material being withheld pursuant to section 38 and ordered that its use be limited to the criminal proceedings as required and that it be made available to the prosecutor and to the trial judge if necessary for the trial court to rule on the fairness of the trial. This approach received implicit approval from the Supreme Court in
Ahmad
(at para 44).
[108]
The Supreme Court placed considerable emphasis on the flexibility of the section 38 scheme in
Ahmad
and even raised the possibility of providing the trial judge with information subject to a non-disclosure order in the following passage:
[45] The problems created by the division of judicial responsibilities may be addressed in different ways. For example, a Federal Court judge exercising the discretion conferred by s. 38.06(2) might find that the only condition required in order to authorize disclosure to the criminal court judge without risking injury to national security is that he or she not reveal the information to the accused, or a condition that the information be reviewed in a designated secure facility. Disclosure of the information to the trial judge alone, as is the norm in other jurisdictions, and for the sole purpose of determining the impact of non-disclosure on the fairness of the trial, will often be the most appropriate option. This is particularly true in light of the minimal risk of providing such access to a trial judge, who is entrusted with the powers and responsibilities of high public office.
[109]
I would further note that the Supreme Court also raised the possibility of having the trial judge appoint a special advocate opposed in interest to the prosecution who could be adequately informed of the matters in issue by authorization of the Attorney General under section 38.03. Thus, the Supreme Court's decision in
Ahmad
indicates that the broad discretion conferred by section 38 should be interpreted to seek an appropriate balance between the public interest in secrecy and the public interest in the effective administration of a fair system of justice.
[110]
The
amici
maintained that the options provided to the trial judge to reduce the impact of the non-disclosure and order remedies are not available in non-criminal trials, since section 38.14 only applies to criminal trials. This restricted reading of section 38 does not seem justified to me. It is true that
Ahmad
applied to a criminal context and determined whether it was constitutional for Parliament to remove from judges hearing criminal trials the power to determine whether information tied to national security concerns should be disclosed and confer this power on Federal Court judges. However, a careful reading of this decision reveals that the Court did not intend to restrict its statements on the flexibility of the scheme to just the criminal context as is evidenced by the excerpts cited above. It is quite true that section 38.14 only applies to criminal matters. However, the presence of this section can be explained by Parliament's need to explicitly provide that the established scheme would not in any way infringe on the right to a fair trial guaranteed under paragraph 11(
d
) of the Charter.
[111]
As mentioned above, this Court is considering for the first time whether information subject to a non-disclosure order under section 38.06 may nevertheless be provided, in one form or another, to the judge hearing the application for judicial review underlying this proceeding. The only related precedent is
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which Justice Noël had to rule on an application for leave to intervene from the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) for the purpose of filing confidentially and under seal the materials received by SIRC
ex parte
the complainant with the judge hearing the judicial review. In this case, Justice Noël clearly envisaged the possibility that the judge hearing the judicial review could hold an
ex parte
and
in camera
hearing to review documents subject to a non-disclosure order, without going into detail about the terms and conditions of such a hearing. The judge who then heard the application for judicial review did hold an
ex parte
and
in camera
hearing but did not say much about the protected documents since they were not relevant for deciding the application for judicial review.
[112]
Moreover, I would note that Justice Mosley, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , gave explicit directions to the
amici
appointed in that case to identify the documents that could be included in an order authorizing the disclosure to the trial judge in one of the forms provided in subsection 38.06(2) of the
CEA
. The underlying proceedings in this case were civil actions brought by several plaintiffs in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario seeking compensatory damages from the Government of Canada for, among other things, alleged complicity in their detention and torture in Syria and Egypt and breach of their constitutional rights: see DES-1-11, dated September 19, 2011. This order clearly gives the idea that in the view of Justice Mosley, subsection 38.06(2) gives the designated judge the authority to provide a judge hearing a civil case with the information for which he or she had ordered non-disclosure.
[113]
It seems to me that we can take the same approach in this case. Even though Mr. Al Telbani is not facing criminal charges, the repercussions of his name remaining on the SPL are not any less serious. It is even possible that the judge who will hear the application for judicial review may find that his constitutional rights have been infringed. In this context, it is essential that the application for judicial review be decided based on all the information that was before the original decision-maker. Administrative decisions cannot be sheltered from review by superior courts, and the legality and constitutionality of decisions that can have a considerable impact on individuals must be assessed in consideration of all the relevant information as is possible. This is not just in the interest of the person before the court but also in the public interest. In the same way that we cannot allow a person to be subject to an illegal administrative decision, or worse a decision that infringes fundamental rights and freedoms, it would be just as damaging for our institutions if the legitimate exercise of a delegated authority were overturned because the reviewing judge did not have all the information that the decision-maker had access to.
[114]
In short, I believe that the option of appointing a designated judge to hear an application for judicial review when that application involves a federal administrative decision increases the options under subsection 38.06(2) when the conditions for disclosure most likely to limit the injury to national security are being considered. If it is possible to consider disclosing sensitive information to a provincial court judge, it must
a fortiori
be desirable to provide such information to a designated judge under the appropriate context. In doing so, this ensures that the application for judicial review will be heard on its merits and will not be dismissed or allowed for lack of information. It would also be damaging for the administration of justice and the rule of law for a decision to be deemed reasonable or unreasonable solely on the fact that a judge did not have all the information that the decision-maker had.
CONCLUSION
[115]
In the pages above, I reviewed the information that the Attorney General wishes to protect in light of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria. I found that, other than the information that could identify employees of the Service or that describes administrative details, the redacted information is relevant to the two underlying applications for judicial review. I also believe that the applicant met his burden of proving that disclosure of the redacted information would be injurious to national security. Last, I believe that the public interest in non-disclosure outweighs, to differing degrees, the public interest in disclosure.
[116]
That being said, it seems crucial to me in this case that the judge hearing the judicial review be able to see the redacted information in order to be able assess the legality of the impugned decisions, or at least determine whether it is possible to rule on this issue despite Mr. Al Telbani's ignorance of certain facts. The applications for judicial review should thus be heard by a designated judge. It will be up to that judge to decide whether
ex parte
and
in camera
hearings should be held and whether an
amicus curiae
or a special advocate should be appointed to help him or her in this task.
[117]
Counsel for the Attorney General and the
amici
should file written submissions to the Court by October 3, 2014, if, in their opinion, these reasons and the confidential order attached (see appendix B) contain sensitive or potentially injurious information that should not be made public and, as necessary, they must indicate what parts should be redacted. These submissions should indicate the nature of the injury to international relations, defence or national security that public disclosure would likely cause.

(7) Subject to subsection (6), after the Federal Court is seized of an application made under this section or, in the case of an appeal from, or a review of, an order of the judge made under any of subsections 38.06(1) to (3), before the appeal or review is disposed of, if the Attorney General of Canada authorizes the disclosure of all or part of the information or withdraws conditions to which the disclosure is subject, the Court's consideration of the application or any hearing, appeal or review shall be terminated in relation to that information, to the extent of the authorization or the withdrawal.
38.06
(1) Unless the judge concludes that the disclosure of the information or facts referred to in subsection 38.02(1) would be injurious to international relations or national defence or national security, the judge may, by order, authorize the disclosure of the information or facts.
(2) If the judge concludes that the disclosure of the information or facts would be injurious to international relations or national defence or national security but that the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance the public interest in non-disclosure, the judge may by order, after considering both the public interest in disclosure and the form of and conditions to disclosure that are most likely to limit any injury to international relations or national defence or national security resulting from disclosure, authorize the disclosure, subject to any conditions that the judge considers appropriate, of all or part of the information or facts, a summary of the information or a written admission of facts relating to the information.
(3) If the judge does not authorize disclosure under subsection (1) or (2), the judge shall, by order, confirm the prohibition of disclosure.
(3.01) An order of the judge that authorizes disclosure does not take effect until the time provided or granted to appeal the order has expired or, if the order is appealed, the time provided or granted to appeal a judgment of an appeal court that confirms the order has expired and no further appeal from a judgment that confirms the order is available.
(3.1) The judge may receive into evidence anything that, in the opinion of the judge, is reliable and appropriate, even if it would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law, and may base his or her decision on that evidence.
(4) A person who wishes to introduce into evidence material the disclosure of which is authorized under subsection (2) but who may not be able to do so in a proceeding by reason of the rules of admissibility that apply in the proceeding may request from a judge an order permitting the introduction into evidence of the material in a form or subject to any conditions fixed by that judge, as long as that form and those conditions comply with the order made under subsection (2).
(5) For the purpose of subsection (4), the judge shall consider all the factors that would be relevant for a determination of admissibility in the proceeding.

(3) Dans le cas où le juge n'autorise pas la divulgation au titre des paragraphes (1) ou (2), il rend une ordonnance confirmant l'interdiction de divulgation.

(3.1) Le juge peut recevoir et admettre en preuve tout élément qu'il estime digne de foi et approprié - même si le droit canadien ne prévoit pas par ailleurs son admissibilité - et peut fonder sa décision sur cet élément.
(4) La personne qui veut faire admettre en preuve ce qui a fait l'objet d'une autorisation de divulgation prévue au paragraphe (2), mais qui ne pourra peut-être pas le faire à cause des règles d'admissibilité applicables à l'instance, peut demander à un juge de rendre une ordonnance autorisant la production en preuve du fait, des renseignements, du résumé ou de l'aveu dans la forme ou aux conditions que celui-ci détermine, dans la mesure où telle forme ou telles conditions sont conformes à l'ordonnance rendue au titre du paragraphe (2).
(5) Pour l'application du paragraphe (4), le juge prend en compte tous les facteurs qui seraient pertinents pour statuer sur l'admissibilité en preuve au cours de l'instance.
APPENDIX B
[Diagram omitted]
.........................
Le Procureur général du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a déposé en Cour fédérale, conformément à l'article 38.04(1) de la
Loi sur la preuve au Canada ( « LPC »)
, un avis de demande afin d'obtenir une ordonnance portant sur la divulgation de certains extraits dans 31 documents. Ces documents devaient faire partie du dossier de l'office fédéral visé par les deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire déposées par le défendeur, tel que le prévoit la Règle 318 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
.
[2]
La divulgation des renseignements contenus dans ces 31 documents est refusée au défendeur suite aux avis donnés au Procureur général conformément aux paragraphes 38.01(1) et (3), comme le prévoit le paragraphe 38.02(1)a) de la
LPC
. Le Procureur général demande à la Cour de confirmer cette interdiction, ou à défaut, d'exercer le pouvoir discrétionnaire que lui confère le paragraphe 38.06(2) d'autoriser la divulgation des renseignements sous réserve des conditions qu'elle estime indiquées pour limiter le préjudice porté aux relations internationales, à la défense ou à la sécurité nationale. Le défendeur s'objecte évidemment à cette demande et cherche à obtenir la divulgation, intégrale ou à tout le moins partielle, des renseignements que cherche à protéger le Procureur général.
[3]
Les présents motifs font suite à une audition publique des deux parties, suivie d'une audition
ex parte
et
in camera
du demandeur et de ses témoins à laquelle participait deux
amici curiae
nommés par la Cour. Les présents motifs font état de l'historique des procédures, des arguments soulevés par les parties et les
amici
et des principes juridiques qui m'ont guidé dans le traitement de cette demande. Ils s'accompagnent d'une ordonnance confidentielle dans laquelle se trouvent les conclusions précises auxquelles j'en suis arrivé eu égard aux renseignements dont on demande la non-divulgation.
Historique des procédures
[4]
Le défendeur est né le 26 septembre 1982 en Arabie Saoudite. Étant citoyen de la Palestine, il est considéré apatride; il est devenu résident permanent du Canada le 21 janvier 2004. Le 4 juin 2008, on lui a refusé le droit d'embarquement à bord d'un vol d'Air Canada en direction de l'Arabie Saoudite, où il devait apparemment se rendre pour maintenir le statut de résident qu'il détient dans ce pays. Ce faisant, on a remis au défendeur copie d'une Directive d'urgence datée du 4 juin 2008 indiquant que le Ministère des Transports, de l'Infrastructure et des Collectivités (le « Ministre ») avait conclu qu'il posait une menace immédiate pour la sûreté de l'aviation.
[5]
Cette décision a donné lieu à la première demande de contrôle judiciaire, déposée par le défendeur le 19 juin 2008 (dossier T-973-08). Le défendeur y conteste la décision d'ajouter son nom sur la
Liste des personnes précisées
( «
LPP
») dans le cadre du Programme de protection des passagers, la Directive d'urgence émise sous l'autorité de l'article 4.76 de la
Loi sur l'aéronautique
. Dans le cadre de cette demande, le défendeur a également contesté la validité constitutionnelle de la Liste des personnes à risques, du Programme de protection des passagers de Transport Canada ainsi que de la disposition précitée de la
Loi sur l'aéronautique
au motif que ces instruments contreviennent aux articles 6, 7 et 15 de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
.
[6]
Le 24 juin 2008, un avocat du Ministère de la Justice à Montréal a donné au Procureur général l'avis prescrit par le paragraphe 38.01(1) de la
LPC
. Cet avis visait sept (7) documents. En conséquence, Transport Canada a transmis au défendeur le 30 juillet 2008 un dossier dont étaient exclus ces sept documents, et a par la suite transmis ces documents au défendeur après les avoir caviardés. Devant le refus de Transport Canada de lui transmettre le dossier intégral auquel il prétendait avoir un droit d'accès, le défendeur a déposé une requête afin d'obtenir la divulgation complète du dossier le concernant, en application de la Règle 317 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
. Saisi de cette requête, le juge Frenette l'a rejetée dans une décision rendue le 27 novembre 2008 et a ordonné la suspension de l'instance afin de permettre au Procureur général de présenter un avis de demande conformément à l'article 38 de la
LPC
, de façon à ce que la question de savoir si les renseignements sensibles ou potentiellement préjudiciables visés par l'avis donné en vertu du paragraphe 38.01(1) puisse être tranchée dans une instance distincte, conformément à l'article 38.04 de la
LPC
. Le défendeur en a appelé de cette décision, mais s'est désisté de son appel le 22 septembre 2009.
[7]
Parallèlement à cette première demande de contrôle judiciaire, le défendeur a fait une demande d'urgence de réexamen auprès du Bureau de réexamen de Transport Canada (le « Bureau ») le 6 juin 2008. Le 29 octobre 2008, le Bureau a recommandé au sous-ministre des Transports de déclarer que la décision d'inscrire le nom du défendeur sur la
LPP
et d'émettre une Directive d'urgence était nulle et sans effet. Le Bureau recommandait par conséquent de retirer le nom du défendeur de la
LPP
. Cette recommandation n'a été transmise au défendeur qu'au mois de juin 2009; aucune information n'a été fournie à la Cour quant à ce long délai pour lui communiquer cette décision.
[8]
Le 10 septembre 2009, le sous-ministre des Transports a décidé de ne pas suivre la recommandation du Bureau et a conclu qu'il pouvait raisonnablement soupçonner le défendeur d'être une menace à la sûreté de l'aviation. Il a par le fait même décidé de maintenir le nom du défendeur sur la
LPP
.
[9]
Suite à cette nouvelle décision, le défendeur a déposé le 14 octobre 2009 une deuxième demande de contrôle judiciaire (dossier T-1696-09).
[10]
Le 8 avril 2010, un « fonctionnaire » au sens du paragraphe 38.01(3) de la
LPC
a avisé le Procureur général que des renseignements sensibles ou potentiellement préjudiciables pouvaient être divulgués dans le cadre d'une instance. Cet avis impliquait des renseignements contenus dans 31 documents. Le 15 avril 2010, le Procureur général a autorisé la divulgation intégrale de 7 documents et la divulgation d'une version caviardée des 24 autres documents; le défendeur a reçu ces documents le 7 mai 2010.
[11]
Le 23 avril 2010, le juge en chef ordonnait que les deux dossiers de contrôle judiciaire procèdent simultanément et que le dossier de Transport Canada soit transmis au greffe, incluant les documents sous leur forme caviardée. L'ordonnance du juge Frenette a également été suspendue, et il a été décidé que les délais et procédures liés à une demande sous l'autorité de l'article 38 de la
LPC
fassent l'objet d'une conférence de gestion d'instance.
[12]
Le 1er juin 2010, le Procureur général a déposé sa demande de non-divulgation conformément au paragraphe 38.04(1) de la
LPC
pour les deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire. Par la suite, soit le 21 juin 2010, le Procureur général a déposé copie de l'affidavit public d' « Éric », employé du Service canadien du renseignement de sécurité (le « Service ») au soutien de sa demande. Le défendeur a déposé le 27 août 2010 une requête en radiation de cet affidavit, requête qui a été rejetée le 22 décembre 2010. Cet affidavit devait ultimement être remplacé par un affidavit identique souscrit par un autre employé du Service, M. Robert Young. Cet affidavit explique en termes généraux le mandat du Service, les raisons pour lesquelles les enquêtes du Service doivent demeurer secrètes et les différentes catégories d'information dont le Service estime que la divulgation serait préjudiciable à la sécurité nationale du Canada.
[13]
Conformément à une ordonnance du juge en chef rendue le 22 juin 2010, M. Al Telbani a été désigné par la Cour comme défendeur dans cette instance, du fait qu'il est une partie dont les intérêts sont touchés par les renseignements pour lesquels le Procureur général veut obtenir une ordonnance de non-divulgation.
[14]
Le 10 novembre 2010, la Cour ordonnait la nomination de deux avocats à titre d'
amicus curiae
(les «
amici
») dans le présent dossier, Me François Dadour et Me Sylvain Lussier. Le déroulement normal des procédures a cependant été interrompu par la requête du défendeur déposée le 17 février 2011 visant à obtenir le paiement de ses frais par le demandeur. Le soussigné a rejeté cette requête le 27 juillet 2011, et l'appel de cette décision a été rejeté le 20 juin 2012. Suite à une directive émise par cette Cour le 4 avril 2013 fixant l'échéancier pour la poursuite du présent dossier, le Procureur général a déposé son affidavit public le 6 mai 2013 et le défendeur a déposé son propre affidavit le 31 mai 2013.
[15]
L'audition publique des deux parties s'est tenue à Montréal le 15 octobre 2013. S'en sont par la suite suivies des discussions entre les
amici
et les avocats du Procureur général quant aux renseignements dont la non-divulgation est recherchée par le Procureur général. Les
amici
ont formulé diverses propositions auxquelles ont réagi les avocats du Procureur général. Au terme de cet exercice qui s'est poursuivi pendant quelques mois, 16 des 31 documents dans lesquels se trouvent de l'information que le Procureur général cherche à protéger ont fait l'objet d'une position commune entre les avocats de ce dernier et les
amici
. Quant aux 15 autres documents, ils ont fait l'objet d'une entente partielle: les
amici
et le Procureur général sont d'accord pour dire que certains renseignements devraient être protégés, mais ne s'entendent pas sur d'autres renseignements.
[16]
Suite à cet exercice, une audience
ex parte
et
in camera
a eu lieu à Ottawa les 3, 4 et 11 avril 2014. À cette occasion, le Procureur général a présenté les deux témoins qui ont souscrit des affidavits secrets au soutien de la demande de non-divulgation, et les
amici
ont pu procéder à leur contre-interrogatoire. Les
amici
ont ensuite présenté leurs observations, sur la base des représentations écrites qu'ils avaient préalablement déposées à la Cour et signifiées au demandeur, et les avocats du Procureur général ont fait de même, également sur la base des représentations écrites déposées plus tôt à la Cour et signifiées aux
amici
.
Questions en litige
[17]
La question centrale soulevée par la présente demande consiste évidemment à déterminer si l'interdiction de divulguer les renseignements identifiés par le Procureur général, telle que prévue à l'alinéa 38.02(1)a) de la
LPC
, doit être confirmée par cette Cour conformément au paragraphe 38.06(3), ou si la divulgation doit plutôt être autorisée, intégralement ou sous réserve de certaines conditions, conformément aux paragraphes 38.06(1) ou (2).
[18]
Les
amici
ont cependant soulevé quelques questions préliminaires portant sur leur rôle et leur fonction, sur le caractère circonscrit du principal renseignement en litige et sur l'incertitude découlant de l'absence d'alternative actuelle à la non-divulgation de l'information litigieuse dans la procédure sous-jacente. Je traiterai des deux dernières questions dans le cadre de mon exposé des principes qui me guideront dans l'examen de la demande du Procureur général, tandis que je traiterai du rôle des
amici
en introduction à mes remarques.
Le cadre juridique
[19]
Il n'est certes pas nécessaire de réitérer que la publicité des débats est un principe fondamental de notre système judiciaire. Les restrictions apportées à ce principe par le législateur et la jurisprudence ont été soigneusement délimitées, et découlent de l'équilibrage auquel il faut parfois procéder pour tenir compte d'autres intérêts importants à protéger, notamment le privilège relatif aux indicateurs de police et le droit à un procès équitable: voir
Personne désignée c Vancouver Sun
, 2007 CST 43, [2007] 3 R.C.S. 253;
Charkaoui (Re)
, 2008 CF 61;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[20]
Les articles 38 et suivants de la
LPC
créent une autre restriction au principe de la publicité des débats. L'article 38.01 oblige tous les participants à une instance, ainsi que les fonctionnaires non participants, à aviser le Procureur général de la possibilité que des renseignements sensibles ou potentiellement préjudiciables soient divulgués. Dans les 10 jours suivants la réception de l'avis, le Procureur général doit prendre une décision relative à la divulgation (art. 38.03(3)). Dans l'hypothèse où le Procureur général n'autorise pas inconditionnellement la divulgation des renseignements et où aucun accord de divulgation n'est conclu, la question de la divulgation peut être soumise à la Cour fédérale (art. 38.04). Une telle demande ne constitue pas un contrôle judiciaire de la décision prise par le Procureur général; le juge désigné saisi de cette demande doit plutôt déterminer si l'interdiction de divulgation des renseignements que l'on cherche à protéger doit être confirmée ou non.
[21]
Les dispositions pertinentes de la
LPC
à ce chapitre sont reproduites à l'annexe A, soient les dispositions suivantes 38.01(1) et (3), 38.02(1), 38.03, 38.031, 38.04, 38.06.
[22]
Dans l'exercice des pouvoirs que lui confère les articles 38 ss. de la
LPC
, le juge désigné applique les critères développés par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'affaire
Canada (Procureur général) c Ribic
, 2003 CAF 246. Le juge devra d'abord établir si les renseignements dont la divulgation est demandée sont pertinents pour l'instance dans laquelle on veut les utiliser. Ce fardeau repose sur la personne qui demande la divulgation. S'il est d'avis que les renseignements sont pertinents, le juge doit ensuite se demander si la divulgation des renseignements serait préjudiciable aux relations internationales, à la défense nationale ou à la sécurité nationale. À cette étape, c'est le Procureur général qui doit prouver le préjudice qui pourrait découler d'une ordonnance de divulgation. Enfin, si le juge estime que la divulgation des renseignements sensibles serait préjudiciable, il doit déterminer si l'intérêt public qui justifierait la divulgation l'emporte sur l'intérêt public qui justifierait la non-divulgation. C'est à la partie qui demande la divulgation qu'il incombe de prouver que la balance de l'intérêt public penche en sa faveur. Cette analyse en trois étapes a été reprise par cette Cour dans plusieurs affaires (voir, entre autres,
Canada (Procureur général) c Khawaja
, 2007 CF 490, [2008] 1 RCF 547;
Canada (Procureur général) c Canada (Commission d'enquête sur les actions des responsables canadiens relativement à Maher Arar)
, 2007 CF 766, [2008] 3 RCF 248;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), et les parties s'entendent sur son application dans le cadre de la présente demande.
Analyse
[23]
Tel que mentionné précédemment, j'aborderai maintenant le rôle des
amici
dans le cadre de la présente procédure, avant de me pencher sur les principes qui me guideront dans l'examen de la demande d'ordonnance présentée par le Procureur général.
- Le rôle des
amici
dans le cadre de la présente procédure
[24]
Les
amici
ont fait valoir, dans leurs représentations écrites, que le mandat et les attributions qui leur ont été confié les amènent à jouer un « rôle opposé » à celui du Ministère public. Lors de l'audition, ils sont allés encore plus loin en affirmant que les intérêts des
amici
et ceux de l'avocate du défendeur convergent parce qu'ils sont pareillement les « adversaires » du Procureur général. Ils s'appuient sur la formulation de l'ordonnance ayant ordonné leur nomination, plus particulièrement sur le pouvoir qui leur est conféré de « contre-interroger » les affiants et les témoins du demandeur, ainsi que sur la nécessité d'un système « robuste » pour garantir une juste détermination des questions dans le cadre d'une procédure à huis clos et
ex parte
.
[25]
Cette conception du rôle que sont appelés à jouer les
amici
dans le cadre d'une procédure découlant de l'article 38 de la
LPC
, du moins lorsqu'elle s'inscrit dans le contexte d'une procédure civile sous-jacente, m'apparaît erronée. Bien que la perception du rôle qui était le leur n'ait pas eu d'impact significatif sur le déroulement du présent dossier dans la mesure où les
amici
se sont acquittés du mandat qui leur avait été confié en respectant rigoureusement les termes de l'ordonnance, il importe néanmoins de préciser l'esprit dans lequel ils doivent normalement aborder leur fonction.
[26]
Les articles 38 ss. de la
LPC
ne prévoient pas explicitement la possibilité pour la Cour de nommer un
amicus
. Il est cependant bien établi que la Cour peut, de son propre chef, désigner un
amicus
lorsqu'elle se penche sur une demande visée à l'article 38 de la
LPC
:
Harkat (Re)
, 2004 CF 1717, au para 20. Le juge en chef Lutfy a même indiqué dans l'arrêt
Canada (Procureur général) c Khawaja
, 2007 CF 463 (au para 57) que le pouvoir discrétionnaire que possède le juge désigné de nommer un
amicus
pour les fins d'une demande présentée sous l'autorité de l'article 38 contribuait à favoriser le respect des principes de justice fondamentale lorsque sont en cause des considérations de sécurité nationale. Le Procureur général n'a d'ailleurs pas contesté la nomination de deux
amici
dans le présent dossier et a convenu d'entrée de jeu du bien-fondé d'une telle nomination.
[27]
Ceci dit, il n'existe pas de définition précise du rôle de l'
amicus
qui soit applicable à toutes les situations possibles où une cour peut trouver bénéfique d'obtenir les conseils d'un avocat qui n'agit pas pour les parties:
R c Cairenius
(2008), 232 CCC(3d) 13, aux paras 52-59;
R c Samra
(1998), 41 O.R.(3d) 434 (C.A). On s'entend généralement pour dire que la nomination d'un
amicus
vise généralement à représenter les intérêts qui ne sont pas représentés devant la cour, à informer cette dernière de certains facteurs dont elle ne serait pas autrement au courant, ou de la conseiller sur une question de droit: voir
Procureur général du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la p. 505 (C.A.C.-B.).
[28]
Il ne fait pas de doute, cependant, que l'
amicus
n'est pas l'avocat de l'accusé (dans une instance criminelle) ou du défendeur (dans une instance civile). Le rôle d'un
amicus
n'est pas davantage assimilable à celui d'un avocat spécial nommé sous l'autorité de l'article 83 de la
LIPR
dans le contexte d'un certificat de sécurité. Son rôle est de prêter main-forte au tribunal et d'assurer la bonne administration de la justice, et son seul « client » est le tribunal ou le juge qui l'a nommé. Comme le rappelait le juge Fish (s'exprimant au nom des dissidents) dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (au para 87), « [u] ne fois nommé, l'
amicus
a une obligation de loyauté et d'intégrité envers le tribunal, et non vis-à-vis de l'une ou l'autre des parties à l'instance ».
[29]
Il ne saurait d'ailleurs en aller autrement si l'
amicus
doit pouvoir jouer intégralement le rôle qui lui est imparti. En effet, il n'est pas inconcevable qu'il ait à faire valoir des arguments ou des points de droit qui ne soient pas nécessairement favorables à l'accusé ou au défendeur. C'est d'ailleurs pour cette raison que la Cour suprême a unanimement conclu dans l'arrêt
Criminal Lawyers' Association
qu'une fois nommé
amicus
, l'avocat qui accepte de tenir le rôle d'avocat de la défense n'est plus l'ami de la Cour (voir les paragraphes 56 pour la majorité et 114 pour la minorité). Bien que la Cour se soit divisée sur la question de savoir si une cour supérieure a le pouvoir inhérent de fixer le taux de rémunération d'un
amicus
, tous les juges ont considéré que le rôle d'un
amicus
et celui d'un avocat de la défense sont antinomiques. J'estime qu'il en va de même dans le cadre d'une procédure civile, même si la ligne de démarcation n'est peut-être pas toujours aussi claire et que les conséquences d'une confusion des genres ne seraient pas nécessairement aussi dramatiques.
[30]
Bref, le fait de jouer un rôle qui peut parfois être opposé à celui du Procureur général ne fait pas de l'
amicus
un avocat de la défense ou de la partie civile. L'objectif de l'
amicus
et l'état d'esprit dans lequel il agit n'est pas de prendre fait et cause pour l'accusé ou le défendeur, mais d'apporter à la Cour un éclairage qu'elle ne recevrait pas autrement et de l'aider à prendre une décision qui soit dans le meilleur intérêt de la justice. Le fait que ces intérêts puissent converger dans certaines circonstances n'y change rien et ne représente pour ainsi dire qu'un bénéfice marginal résultant de la nomination d'un
amicus
. Ce dernier se doit donc d'agir en tout temps avec transparence, sans jamais tenter de prendre les avocats du Procureur général par surprise. Les tactiques et les stratégies que pourrait à bon droit utiliser un avocat de la défense et même, dans certaines circonstances, un avocat spécial, ne sont pas de mise dans le cadre d'une procédure découlant de l'article 38 de la
LPC
.
[31]
Ceci dit, le rôle de l'
amicus
dans une telle procédure pourra être modulé par le juge qui le nomme pour tenir compte du caractère très particulier d'une demande présentée sous l'autorité de l'article 38 de la
LPC
. La nature même des renseignements auxquels l'
amicus
aura accès, la gravité des enjeux que soulève l'équilibrage de la sécurité nationale et l'équité des procédures, et le degré de transparence avec lequel le Procureur général ainsi que les témoins appelés au soutien de la demande s'acquittent de leur fonction, sont autant de facteurs qui pourront amener un
amicus
à jouer un rôle plus ou moins interventionniste selon les circonstances.
[32]
Je terminerais en soulignant que l'ordonnance rendue 10 novembre 2010 était tout à fait limpide et ne laissait subsister aucun doute quant au rôle qu'étaient appelés à jouer les
amici
. Il y était notamment ordonné que Me Dadour et Me Lussier soient nommés « pour agir à titre d'amici curiae dans la présente instance afin d'assister la Cour dans sa préparation pour les audiences à huis clos et d'intervenir dans ces mêmes audiences », et qu'ils ne puissent communiquer avec le défendeur ou sa procureure à partir du moment où ils auront eu accès aux renseignements et informations confidentiels. Quant au pouvoir de contre-interroger les affiants et les témoins du demandeur, il s'agit là d'une clause qui se retrouve dans toutes les ordonnances émises par cette Cour dans des dossiers similaires. Encore une fois, l'objet de tels contre-interrogatoires n'est pas de prendre fait et cause pour le défendeur et d'épouser ses intérêts comme si l'
amicus
avait une relation avocat-client avec le défendeur, mais bien plutôt de vérifier la fiabilité et la force probante de la preuve déposée par le demandeur et la robustesse de ses arguments.
[33]
La Cour n'a évidemment pas été impliqué dans les discussions qu'ont eues les avocats du Procureur général et les
amici
eu égard à la divulgation des renseignements contenus dans les 31 documents en cause dans la présente demande. À l'évidence, ces discussions ont porté fruit dans la mesure où un accord est intervenu sur plusieurs des renseignements dont on tentait d'obtenir la non-divulgation. Sans doute eut-il été utile pour la Cour (et peut-être aussi pour le Procureur général) de connaître avant l'audition
ex parte
et
in camera
les motifs qui sous-tendent la position des
amici
lorsqu'il y a désaccord entre eux. Ceci dit, la position du Procureur général n'est guère plus explicite et ne repose pour chaque renseignement que sur xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx x représentant de façon générique le fondement de l'exclusion recherchée. Bref, je ne vois rien de répréhensible dans la façon dont les
amici
se sont acquittés de leur tâche, et je ne considère pas davantage qu'ils auraient dû obtenir la permission de la Cour avant de présenter leurs observations préliminaires par écrit. Cette démarche était autorisée par l'ordonnance du 10 novembre 2010, et leur mémoire a été acheminé au Procureur général près d'un mois avant l'audition.
[34]
Ces précisions étant apportées, je procéderai maintenant à l'analyse en trois étapes développée par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
a) La pertinence des renseignements visés par la demande de non-divulgation
[35]
Tel que mentionné plus haut, la demande d'ordonnance présentée par le Procureur général en vertu du paragraphe 38.06(3) de la
LPC
ne vise qu'un nombre limité de documents (31). Qui plus est, ce n'est pas l'intégralité de ces documents dont on demande la non-divulgation; seuls certains passages de ces documents sont visés. Enfin, il importe de souligner que plusieurs de ces documents sont redondants ou reprennent les mêmes informations, ce qui limite d'autant la quantité de renseignements que l'on cherche à protéger.
[36]
Seize des trente-et-un documents qui font l'objet d'une demande de non-divulgation ont fait l'objet d'une entente totale entre les avocats du Procureur général et les
amici
. Bien que cette entente ne lie pas la Cour, elle n'en sera pas moins d'un très grand intérêt lorsque viendra le moment de déterminer si la non-divulgation de certains renseignements réclamée par le Procureur général est justifiée ou non. Il faut dire que les informations caviardées dans ces seize documents ne sont pas vraiment pertinentes pour les fins des contrôles judiciaires sous-jacents, dans la mesure où elles révèlent essentiellement les noms de certains employés du Service ainsi que des numéros de téléphone de nature opérationnelle qui ne sont pas connus du public. Dans un document, l'information caviardée se rapporte à un dossier xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx tandis que dans un autre document, l'information pourrait révéler le succès ou l'échec d'une enquête. En fait, la seule information apparaissant dans quelques uns de ces seize documents (ainsi que dans d'autres documents sur lesquels une entente globale n'est pas intervenue) qui pourrait potentiellement être d'une certaine utilité pour le défendeur ont été obtenues auprès de tierces parties, j'aurai l'occasion un peu plus loin d'expliciter mon raisonnement à cet égard.
[37]
Ne subsistent donc que 15 documents qui ne font pas l'objet d'une position commune dans leur entièreté entre les avocats du Procureur général et les
amici
. Encore une fois, il convient de répéter que le Procureur général ne réclame pas la non-divulgation de l'intégralité de ces 15 documents mais uniquement de certaines portions (plus ou moins substantielles) de ces documents. D'autre part, le désaccord entre les avocats du Procureur général et les
amici
ne porte pas sur tous les extraits que l'on cherche à protéger, mais uniquement sur certains d'entre eux.
[38]
Tel que mentionné dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la première tâche du juge désigné chargé d'examiner une demande de non-divulgation conformément à l'article 38 de la
LPC
consiste à déterminer si les renseignements dont on recherche l'exclusion sont pertinents ou non dans le cadre de la procédure sous-jacente. Bien que le fardeau incombe à la partie qui demande la divulgation, le seuil à rencontrer est peu élevé. Dans le cadre d'une procédure criminelle, le critère de la pertinence sera tributaire de la règle développée dans l'arrêt
R c Stinchcombe
, [1991] 3 R.C.S. 326, à savoir que les renseignements en cause peuvent raisonnablement être utiles à la défense.
[39]
Le critère de la pertinence ne sera pas le même dans le cadre d'une procédure civile, comme c'était le cas dans l'affaire
Canada (Procureur général) c Almaki
, 2010 CF 1106, ou encore dans le cadre d'une procédure d'enquête (
Canada (Procureur général) c Canada (Commission d'enquête sur les actions des responsables canadiens relativement à Maher Arar)
, 2007 CF 766).
[40]
En l'occurrence, les procédures sous-jacentes sont deux contrôles judiciaires à l'encontre de décisions prises par Transport Canada. En cette matière, c'est la Règle 317 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
qui régit la pertinence et détermine les documents qui doivent être produits par l'office fédéral dont les décisions font l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire. Cette Règle prévoit qu'une partie peut demander la transmission des documents ou des éléments matériels « pertinents quant à la demande ». Cette Règle a été interprété largement au point d'englober tout document « qui peut influer sur la manière dont la Cour disposera de la demande »:
Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c Pathak
, [1995] 2 C.F. 455, à la p. 460 (CAF). Dans une autre affaire, on a conclu qu'un document pouvait être pertinent même si le décideur ne s'y est pas référé ou ne l'a pas utilisé au soutien de sa décision:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F.). C'est dire que l'obligation de déposer un dossier complet couvre non seulement les documents que le décideur avait en sa possession lors de la prise de décision, mais aussi les documents qui devraient l'être aux fins du contrôle judiciaire:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[41]
En l'occurrence, le Procureur général a concédé qu'une grande partie de l'information dont il sollicite la non-divulgation est pertinente pour les fins des demandes de contrôle judiciaire présentées par le défendeur. Ne sont exclus, au stade de la pertinence, que les renseignements portant sur les noms et les coordonnées de certains employés du Service, ainsi que sur les procédures internes et administratives comme des numéros de dossiers. Pour tous les autres renseignements, il faut passer à la deuxième étape de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et déterminer si leur divulgation porterait préjudice à la sécurité nationale.
b) L'identification d'un préjudice à la sécurité nationale
[42]
Lorsqu'il est établi que les renseignements sont pertinents, c'est au Procureur général qu'incombe le fardeau de démontrer que ces renseignements, s'ils sont divulgués, « sont susceptibles de porter préjudice aux relations internationales, à la défense ou à la sécurité nationale », pour reprendre le libellé de la définition que donne l'article 38 à l'expression « renseignements potentiellement préjudiciables ». À ce chapitre, l'évaluation que fait le Procureur général sera d'un poids considérable, étant donné les sources particulières d'information et d'expertise auxquelles il a accès. Comme le précisait la Cour d'appel dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (au para 19):
Cela veut dire que les conclusions du procureur général concernant son évaluation du préjudice pour la sécurité nationale, la défense nationale ou les relations internationales, devraient, parce qu'il a accès à des sources particulières d'information et d'expertise, se voir accorder un poids considérable de la part du juge appelé à décider, en application du paragraphe 38.06(1), si la divulgation des renseignements causerait le préjudice appréhendé. Le procureur général exerce un rôle protecteur envers la sécurité du public. Si l'évaluation qu'il fait du préjudice est raisonnable, le juge doit l'accepter ...
Voir aussi:
Canada (Procureur général) c Khawaja
, 2007 CF 490, [2008] 1 RCF 547, au para 64;
Canada (Procureur général) c Almaki
, 2010 CF 1106, [2012] 2 R.C.F. 508, au para 70.
[43]
Par conséquent, la Cour doit faire preuve de retenue lorsqu'elle est appelée à se prononcer sur une demande de non-divulgation sous l'autorité de l'article 38 de la
LPC.
Cette attitude se justifie d'autant plus que le concept même de « sécurité nationale » est fluide et ne se prête pas à une définition précise. Mes collègues les juges Mosley et Noël se sont livrés à une longue analyse de ce concept dans les arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et
Canada (Procureur général) c Canada (Commission d'enquête sur les actions des responsables canadiens relativement à Maher Arar)
, 2007 CF 766, [2008] 3 R.C.F. 248, et ils en ont notamment tiré la conclusion que la sécurité nationale ne se réduisait pas à la préservation de l'intégrité nationale ou à la capacité de répondre à l'usage ou à la menace d'usage de la force, et s'entendait au minimum de la préservation du mode de vie canadien, notamment de la protection de la sécurité des personnes, des institutions et des libertés au Canada. Je fais miens leurs propos. La difficulté d'identifier précisément ce qui constitue une menace pour la sécurité nationale constitue, à mon avis, un motif supplémentaire militant en faveur d'un niveau assez élevé de déférence de la part de cette Cour à l'endroit de l'évaluation faite par les autorités gouvernementales. S'exprimant à ce propos, la Cour suprême écrivait dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au para 85:
...dans le contexte des dispositions régissant l'expulsion, il faut interpréter l'expression « danger pour la sécurité du Canada » d'une manière large et équitable, et en conformité avec les normes internationales. Nous reconnaissons que l'expression « danger pour la sécurité du Canada » est difficile à définir. Nous convenons aussi que la conclusion qu'il existe ou on un « danger pour la sécurité du Canada » repose en grande partie sur les faits et ressortit à la politique, au sens large. Tous ces éléments militent en faveur de l'application d'une approche large et souple en matière de sécurité nationale et, comme nous l'avons déjà expliqué, d'une norme de contrôle judiciaire caractérisée par la retenue. Si la ministre peut produire une preuve étayant raisonnablement la conclusion que l'intéressé constitue un danger pour la sécurité du Canada, les tribunaux ne doivent pas intervenir et modifier sa décision.
[44]
Ceci étant dit, la Cour ne saurait abdiquer le rôle que lui a confié le législateur et se contenter d'entériner aveuglément les demandes de non-divulgation que peut lui présenter le Procureur général. Bien que la Cour doive faire preuve de retenue, elle est néanmoins en droit de s'attendre à ce que le Procureur général établisse, à partir de faits établis par la preuve, que le préjudice allégué n'est pas une simple possibilité ou un conjecture mais constitue une probabilité:
Arar
, para 49; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , para 70. En d'autres termes, il ne suffira pas de spéculer qu'un renseignement pourrait éventuellement être dommageable pour la sécurité nationale; il faudra établir, à partir d'une preuve concrète et fiable, que le préjudice est sérieux et ne repose pas sur de simples hypothèses. Nous n'en sommes plus à l'époque où les tribunaux devaient s'incliner chaque fois qu'un ministre refusait la production d'un document en se prévalant du privilège de la Couronne relatif à la sécurité nationale. Avec l'entrée en vigueur de l'article 36.2 de la
LPC
(S.C. 1980-81-82, c 111, art 4), maintenant devenu l'article 38, la Cour fédérale s'est vue confier le mandat de déterminer si des renseignements peuvent être divulgués en vertu de l'article 38.04. Pour s'acquitter de ce rôle, la Cour doit non seulement prendre connaissance des renseignements que le Procureur général cherche à ne pas rendre publics, mais doit également vérifier que ces renseignements sont bel et bien visés par l'interdiction de divulguer prévue à l'article 38.02(1) de la
LPC
.
[45]
On reconnaît que la divulgation de certaines catégories de renseignements portera généralement préjudice à la sécurité nationale. Dès 1988, cette Cour indiquait que la divulgation de renseignements qui identifiaient ou qui tendaient à identifier des sources de renseignements humaines ou technique, des sujets d'enquête passés ou présents, la nature et le contenu de renseignements classifiés, des techniques d'investigation ou des méthodes d'enquête, ou encore la durée, l'envergure, le succès ou l'échec d'enquêtes, pouvaient être considérées comme préjudiciables pour la sécurité nationale: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au para 29; voir aussi, dans la même veine,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  qu'elle était encore membre de cette Cour, a donné les exemples suivants de renseignements dont on doit préserver le caractère confidentiel:
1. Les renseignements provenant de sources humaines, lorsque leur divulgation permettrait d'identifier la source et risquerait de mettre sa vie en danger [...] La mise en danger d'une source humaine risque en outre de dissuader d'autres sources ou sources potentielles de renseignements, qui auront scrupule à fournir des informations s'ils ne sont pas sûrs que leur identité sera protégée.
2. Les renseignements provenant d'agents du Service, lorsque la divulgation permettrait d'identifier l'agent et mettrait sa vie en péril.
3. Les renseignements concernant des enquêtes en cours lorsque la divulgation de ces renseignements alerterait ceux qui agissent contre les intérêts du Canada, leur permettant de se soustraire aux recherches.
4. Les secrets transmis par des pays étrangers ou des services de renseignement étrangers, lorsque la divulgation non autorisée de ces renseignements porterait ces pays ou ces services à ne plus confier de secrets à un destinataire qui n'est pas digne de confiance ou qui n'est pas à même d'en assurer la confidentialité [...]
5. Les renseignements concernant les techniques et les moyens de surveillance ainsi que certaines méthodes ou techniques d'enquête employées par le Service, lorsque cette divulgation aiderait à se soustraire à la détection, à la surveillance ou à l'interception de leurs communications, des personnes ayant attiré l'attention du Service.
Harkat (Re)
, 2005 CF 393, au paragraphe 89.
[47]
Dans l'affidavit public qu'il a souscrit au soutien de la présente demande de non-divulgation, M. Robert Young a catégorisé les renseignements que le Service cherche à protéger en empruntant plus ou moins à cette classification. Deux autres affidavits confidentiels ont également été déposés et reprennent cette même classification en particularisant davantage les informations visées. Ces catégories sont les suivantes:
- L'information qui révélerait ou tendrait à révéler l'intérêt du Service en ce qui concerne certains individus, groupes ou sujets, y compris l'existence ou l'inexistence de dossiers actuels ou passés, l'intensité des enquêtes ou le degré de succès ou l'insuccès des enquêtes;
- L'information qui révélerait ou tendrait à révéler les modes de fonctionnement et les techniques d'enquête utilisées par le Service;
- L'information qui révélerait ou tendrait à révéler les rapports que le Service entretient avec d'autres services de police, de sécurité ou de renseignement et divulguerait des renseignements échangés sous le sceau du secret avec ces organismes;
- L'information qui révélerait ou tendrait à révéler l'identité de certains employés, des procédures internes et des méthodes administratives du Service, comme des noms et des numéros de dossiers;
- L'information qui révélerait ou tendrait à révéler les sources humaines des renseignements du Service ou le contenu des renseignements fournis par des sources humaines qui, s'ils étaient divulgués, pourraient permettre d'identifier les sources humaines en question.
[48]
Dans le cadre du présent dossier, et suite aux discussions qui ont eu lieu entre les avocats du Procureur général et les
amici
, les seules informations qui n'ont pas fait l'objet d'une entente relèvent exclusivement des trois premières catégories de renseignement mentionnées dans le paragraphe qui précède. Il va sans dire que certains renseignements peuvent tomber dans plus d'une catégorie. Je m'attarderai donc maintenant à chacune de ces trois catégories.
[49]
Le Procureur général cherche d'abord à obtenir la non-divulgation d'informations concernant l'intérêt que pourrait avoir le Service pour M. Al Telbani et les enquêtes relatives à ses activités ou à celles d'autres personnes avec lesquelles il est ou a été en contact. Il est vrai que M. Al Telbani est évidemment au courant de l'intérêt que porte le Service à ses activités en ligne suite à l'entrevue qu'il a eue avec le Service le 2 juin 2008, au cours de laquelle il a été confronté à certains faits concernant le soutien technique qu'il apporterait à des activités extrémistes. Ce que le Service cherche à protéger, ce sont d'autres faits qui n'ont pas été portés à la connaissance de M. Al Telbani susceptibles de révéler la nature et la portée de l'enquête xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx de même que les évaluations et les analyses qui en ont découlé.
[50]
Il ne me semble pas faire de doute, comme l'a soutenu le témoin qui a souscrit un affidavit au nom du SCRS, qu'un service de sécurité ne peut exercer efficacement ses activités si les personnes qui sont visées par ses enquêtes sont en mesure de savoir qu'elles présentent un intérêt ou de savoir ce que le service en question sait à leur sujet à un moment précis, l'évaluation opérationnelle qui en résulte et même le fait que le service est en mesure de tirer certaines conclusions quant aux cibles de ses enquêtes. La divulgation de tels renseignements permettrait à une personne ciblée de prendre des mesures pour se soustraire aux démarches du Service, ou même d'introduire dans l'enquête de l'information fausse ou trompeuse. L'ampleur et la fiabilité de l'information recueillie par le Service s'en trouverait amoindrie, et sa capacité d'identifier et de contrer des menaces potentielles s'en trouverait compromise.
[51]
Dans le cas présent, l'entrevue du défendeur avec le Service xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx. Je suis d'accord avec le demandeur pour dire que la divulgation de l'information fournie par le Service à Transport Canada dans le cadre de sa recommandation à l'effet d'ajouter le nom du défendeur sur la LPP fournirait à ce dernier une aide précieuse dans son rôle présumé de xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxx En lui fournissant des informations précises relativement à l'enquête xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx. Cela aurait des conséquences négatives non seulement pour les fins de la présente enquête, mais également pour d'autres enquêtes menées par le Service xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx.
[52]
Pour les motifs qui précèdent, je suis donc d'avis que la divulgation de tous les extraits xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx dans les quinze documents n'ayant pas fait l'objet d'un accord total entre le Procureur général et les
amici
porterait atteinte à la sécurité nationale. La véritable question, bien entendu, consiste à savoir si les raisons d'intérêt public qui justifient la divulgation l'emportent sur les raisons d'intérêt public qui justifient la non-divulgation, et si oui, à quelles conditions et sous quelle forme l'information doit être divulguée. Avant de passer à cette dernière étape du test, il convient cependant d'examiner les deux autres catégories d'information dont le Procureur général réclame la non- divulgation et qui n'ont pas fait l'objet d'entente avec les
amici
.
[53]
La seconde catégorie de renseignements dont on cherche à obtenir la non-divulgation sont ceux qui révéleraient ou tendraient à révéler les modes de fonctionnement et les techniques d'enquête utilisées par le Service. À ce chapitre, l'affiant du Service a témoigné que la divulgation de ce type de renseignements nuirait à l'efficacité des techniques et des méthodes qui pourraient être utilisées dans le cadre de la présente enquête ou d'enquêtes portant sur d'autres personnes, dans la mesure où les individus susceptibles d'être visés par de telles enquêtes pourraient être en mesure de contrecarrer les efforts du Service ou à tout le moins de diminuer l'efficacité des moyens présentement utilisés.
[54]
Ce risque est d'autant plus élevé dans la présente affaire que le défendeur a complété une maîtrise en sécurité des systèmes d'information. Xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx Il n'est pas sans intérêt non plus de noter qu'au dire de l'affiant, le défendeur était visiblement secoué d'apprendre lors de son entrevue que le Service avait découvert ses alias et cherchait à savoir comment on avait découvert qu'il était « Mujahid Taqni ». Dans ce contexte, les préoccupations du Procureur général m'apparaissent particulièrement bien fondées. On ne peut certainement pas écarter la possibilité réelle que le défendeur puisse être en mesure d'exploiter l'information visée par la présente demande pour nuire à l'enquête dont lui ou d'autres personnes pourraient faire l'objet, ce qui compliquerait sensiblement la tâche du Service et même, éventuellement, de tierces parties.
[55]
Au nombre des informations que l'on cherche à protéger, il y en a une bien particulière qui tendrait à démontrer, selon la thèse du Procureur général, que le défendeur constitue une menace à la sécurité aérienne. Cette information, qui se retrouve sous diverses formes dans plusieurs documents, xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx Lors des audiences
in camera
et
ex parte
, les
amici
ont référé à cette information comme « l'éléphant dans la pièce ».
[56]
Le Procureur général s'objecte vigoureusement à la divulgation de cette information pour deux raisons. Il soutient tout d'abord que cette information xxxxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx. Au surplus, on prétend que la divulgation de cette information permettrait au défendeur de soupçonner, sinon d'avoir la certitude, que cette information xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxxx. xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxx xx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx.
[57]
Lors de son contre-interrogatoire, xx xxxxxxxxxxxx a reconnu que xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx x xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxx xxxx xx x xxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xx xxxx xxx x xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxx xx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx x xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xx x x xxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx. Xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxx .
[58]
Encore une fois, le fait que la divulgation des informations relevant de cette deuxième catégorie et xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx dans les documents contestés porterait atteinte à la sécurité nationale ne met pas un terme à l'analyse que doit faire cette Cour dans le cadre de l'analyse requise par l'article 38 de la
LPC
. Le fait que le défendeur xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx sera évidemment une considération importante à soupeser à l'étape de la mise en balance des préjudices que commande l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[59]
La dernière catégorie de renseignements faisant l'objet d'un désaccord entre le Procureur général et les
amici
sont ceux qui révéleraient ou tendraient à révéler les rapports qu'entretient le Service avec d'autres services de renseignement ou qui divulgueraient ou tendraient à divulguer des informations échangées sous le sceau du secret avec ces organismes. Les nombreux extraits que l'on voudrait protéger sous cette rubrique reprennent tous la même information, qui tient en xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx.
[60]
Le Procureur général a fait valoir qu'il était essentiel pour le Service de coopérer avec d'autres services secrets pour remplir le mandat que lui a été confié de conseiller le gouvernement en matière de lutte au terrorisme. Il en va ainsi parce que les actes terroristes ne sont pas nécessairement planifiés, financés, dirigés ou exécutés par les résidents d'un seul pays ou à l'intérieur des frontières d'un seul État. Par conséquent, la seule façon d'enquêter efficacement sur ces menaces pour tenter de les prévenir implique une étroite collaboration et un partage d'information au niveau international.
[61]
Or, ce partage d'informations secrètes par les services secrets étrangers avec lesquels le Service a une entente globale ou ponctuelle se fait toujours en prenant pour acquis que la source ou le contenu des renseignements ainsi obtenus ne sera pas dévoilée sans le consentement de l'organisme à l'origine de ces renseignements. C'est ce que l'on appelle parfois la « règle des tiers ». Il s'agit là d'une reconnaissance que les agences étrangères fournissent de l'information au Service non seulement parce que des ententes sont conclues pour s'assurer que cette information sera utilisée de façon confidentielle, mais également parce ces agences ont confiance que le gouvernement canadien en général, et le Service en particulier, est bien au fait et reconnaît la nécessité de préserver la confidentialité de ces renseignements et a pris des mesures à cet égard.
[62]
Il va sans dire qu'une défaillance du gouvernement canadien ou du Service relativement à la protection des renseignements obtenus d'une agence étrangère pourrait avoir des conséquences désastreuses sur le maintien des ententes déjà en vigueur ou sur la capacité du Service de conclure de nouvelles ententes avec d'autres agences étrangères. Comme il a été dit dans de nombreuses affaires, le Canada est un importateur net de renseignements secrets, et toute interruption ou diminution des échanges de ces renseignements nuirait au maintien de notre sécurité collective et au rôle que joue le Canada sur la scène internationale à cet égard. Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême a reconnu (aux paragraphes 43 et 54) l'importance de cette préoccupation « urgente et réelle ». Plus récemment, elle a indiqué dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (au para 68) que le Canada est un importateur net de renseignements sur la sécurité, que ces derniers sont « essentiels pour la sécurité et la défense du Canada », et que leur divulgation « nuirait à la circulation et à la qualité de ces renseignements ». Mon collègue le juge Noël a bien résumé l'importance de cette règle dans l'affaire
Arar
, au paragraphe 77 de ses motifs:
Pour autant, la règle des tiers est à mon avis essentielle pour garantir le bon fonctionnement des organisations modernes chargées du renseignement ou de l'application de la loi. Cela est d'autant plus vrai que les activités criminelles organisées ne se limitent pas au territoire géographique d'un pays donné et que l'histoire récente a clairement montré que la planification d'activités terroristes n'a pas nécessairement lieu dans le pays visé par l'attaque, réduisant ainsi les possibilités de détection. Par conséquent, des liens étroits avec les agences étrangères de renseignement et d'application de la loi, à quoi s'ajoutent une solide coopération et un échange de renseignements entre telles agences, sont essentiels pour leur bon fonctionnement partout dans le monde.

A priori
, je ne doute pas que la divulgation de l'information xxxxxx xxxxxxxx x xxxxxxx xxxxxx serait préjudiciable à l'intérêt national du Canada. La jurisprudence en cette matière, de même que le témoignage secret des affiants, me convainquent que le Service xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx. Il en résulterait très certainement une capacité diminuée de remplir le mandat xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx par le législateur, notamment en ce qui concerne la lutte au terrorisme tant au Canada que sur la scène internationale.

[70]
Aussi importante que puisse être la règle des tiers, cependant, elle ne saurait être absolue. Cette « règle » n'a pas de fondement législatif, et le seul fait qu'une agence étrangère n'ait pas relevé le Service (ou toute autre agence canadienne) de son obligation de confidentialité ne saurait suffire, à lui seul, pour conclure que la divulgation d'un renseignement ainsi obtenu serait préjudiciable à la sécurité nationale. D'autres facteurs devront être considérés, notamment le fait que l'information en question ait subséquemment été dévoilée et fasse maintenant partie du domaine public, ainsi que l'écoulement du temps. Il faudra également tenir compte de l'importance que peut avoir pour le Canada le partage de renseignement avec un organisme étranger, tant au plan quantitatif que qualitatif. Comme l'affirmait mon collègue le juge Noël dans l'affaire
Arar
(au para 80):
Lorsqu'on se demande si la divulgation de renseignements causera un préjudice, il importe également de considérer la nature de la relation du Canada avec l'agence de renseignement ou l'agence d'application de la loi d'où proviennent les renseignements. Il est admis que certaines agences présentent une importance plus grande pour le Canada et donc qu'il faut faire davantage pour protéger nos relations avec elles. Par conséquent, il faut agir avec circonspection lorsqu'on envisage la possibilité de transgresser la règle des tiers à l'égard de renseignements obtenus de nos alliés les plus importants.
[71]
Dans le cas présent, xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx revêtent une importance cruciale pour le Canada. J'accepte par ailleurs l'argument du Procureur général voulant que la divulgation d'un renseignement obtenu d'une agence avec laquelle le Canada entretient des liens moins cruciaux pourrait néanmoins avoir des répercussions à long terme, non seulement parce qu'il pourrait en résulter un tarissement des informations en provenance de cette agence mais également parce que cela pourrait décourager d'autres agences de maintenir ou de créer des liens avec le Canada.
[72]
Un autre facteur dont il faut tenir compte, tant dans l'évaluation du préjudice que dans la mise en balance des intérêts publics, sera l'effort qu'a mis (ou non) le gouvernement canadien pour obtenir le consentement d'une agence étrangère à la divulgation d'un renseignement fourni par cette agence. Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (infirmé pour d'autres motifs par la Cour suprême), la Cour d'appel fédérale a semblé d'avis que les autorités canadiennes devaient faire un « effort raisonnable » pour solliciter le consentement de l'agence tiers qui a fourni les renseignements avant de conclure qu'il serait préjudiciable de divulguer cette information. Voir aussi, dans le même sens: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paras 145-146;
Charkaoui (Re),
2009 CF 476, aux paras 28-29.
[73]
Plus récemment, cette Cour a quelque peu nuancé cette obligation. Dans l'arrêt
Arar
(aux paras 75 et 94), le juge Noël s'est dit d'avis qu'il ne convenait pas de tirer une conclusion négative du fait que le Procureur général n'avait pas sollicité le consentement d'une agence étrangère pour divulguer des renseignements, compte tenu du fait qu'une telle autorisation aurait vraisemblablement été refusée selon la preuve au dossier. Le juge Mosley, pour sa part, en est arrivé à la conclusion que le défaut d'adresser des demandes à des agences étrangères en vue d'obtenir leur consentement à la divulgation des renseignements qu'elles avaient transmis n'était pas fatale mais pouvait être prise en considération et avoir un effet défavorable sur une revendication du privilège, surtout lorsque les renseignements paraissent anodins à première vue. Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il a néanmoins accepté les représentations du Procureur général à l'effet qu'il serait futile de demander à certains pays de consentir à la divulgation de leurs renseignements.
[74]
Dans la présente affaire, xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx, je conçois aisément qu'il est hautement improbable qu'un tel accord aurait été donné.
[75]
Je suis donc d'avis que l'information dont on cherche à empêcher la divulgation au motif qu'elle émane de tierces parties passe la deuxième étape du test développé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Il n'en découle pas nécessairement que cette information doit être intégralement soustraite du dossier auquel a droit M. Al Telbani dans le cadre de ses demandes de contrôle judiciaire. Pour trancher cette question, il faut passer à la troisième étape du test et déterminer quel intérêt public l'emporte: celui qui milite pour la divulgation ou celui qui favorise plutôt la non-divulgation. Comme c'est le cas pour les autres catégories d'information dont on revendique la non-divulgation, il faudra à cette étape tenir compte d'autres considérations, comme l'écoulement du temps et le fait que certaines informations sont maintenant dans le domaine public. Dans cette optique, il faudra aussi examiner la possibilité de minimiser le préjudice que pourrait entraîner la divulgation d'un renseignement, en remplaçant par exemple un extrait jugé trop sensible par un résumé. À cet égard, il aurait été utile que l'on dépose devant la Cour le document original transmis par les tierces parties de façon à mieux pouvoir comparer le texte que l'on veut protéger avec ce document et ainsi mieux évaluer le dommage que pourrait causer une version expurgée ou un résumé de ce texte. Malgré la demande de la Cour à cet effet, le Procureur général n'a pas jugé bon de déposer les documents originaux transmis par les tierces parties et c'est donc avec un certain handicap que la Cour devra se livrer à cet examen.
c) La pondération des intérêts publics à la divulgation et à la non-divulgation
[76]
En vertu de la jurisprudence qui s'est développée eu égard à l'interprétation de l'article 38 de la
LPC
, la partie qui cherche à obtenir la divulgation d'un renseignement doit apporter la preuve que l'intérêt public milite en sa faveur. Le paragraphe 38.06(2) prévoit en effet que la Cour peut, dans l'hypothèse où elle est convaincue que les raisons d'intérêt public militent en faveur de la divulgation, autoriser la divulgation des renseignements selon la forme et les conditions les plus susceptibles de limiter le préjudice porté aux relations internationales ou à la défense ou à la sécurité nationales.
[77]
L'article 38 de la
LPC
ne précise pas le critère à appliquer, mais il va de soi que la Cour devra considérer plusieurs facteurs différents qui peuvent varier d'une affaire à une autre. Dans un contexte criminel, la question de savoir si les renseignements en cause établiront vraisemblablement un fait essentiel pour la défense est un facteur important dont il faut tenir compte dans le processus de pondération des intérêts. La présente affaire n'est pas de cette nature, dans la mesure où le défendeur ne fait pas l'objet d'accusations criminelles. Les demandes de contrôle judiciaire qu'a déposées le défendeur s'apparentent davantage à une procédure civile, et dans ce contexte la Cour d'appel fédérale a confirmé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (au para 22) qu'il convenait d'appliquer un critère plus rigoureux que celui de la pertinence, et qu'il fallait plutôt se demander si les renseignements demandés sont susceptibles d'établir un fait crucial pour la partie qui les réclame.
[78]
Dans cette optique, les tribunaux ont dégagé plusieurs facteurs à considérer lors de l'exercice de la pondération des intérêts divergents en matière de divulgation et de non-divulgation: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Procureur général) c Kempo
, 2004 CF 1678, au para 102;
Arar
, au para 98; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au para 174. Sans être nécessairement exhaustive, cette liste comprend notamment les éléments suivants:
- la nature de l'intérêt public que l'on tente de protéger par le secret;
- l'admissibilité du document, l'utilité et la valeur probante des renseignements qu'il contient;
- la gravité de l'accusation ou des questions soulevées dans la procédure sous-jacente;
- la question de savoir si la partie qui demande la divulgation a établi qu'il n'existe pas d'autres moyens raisonnables d'obtenir les renseignements;
- la question de savoir si les demandes de divulgation de renseignements visent véritablement la communication de certains documents ou constituent plutôt des interrogatoires à l'aveuglette;
- la question de savoir si les renseignements caviardé sont déjà connus du public et, dans l'affirmative, la manière dont les renseignements sont tombés dans le domaine public;
- la question de savoir s'il y a des intérêts supérieurs en jeu, par exemple une violation des droits garantis par la Charte, le droit de présenter une défense pleine et entière dans le contexte criminel, etc.
[79]
L'avocate du demandeur et les
amici
ont également fait valoir que la stigmatisation créée par l'association du défendeur à un groupe ou à des activités terroristes et l'application de mesures préventives restreignant sa liberté faisaient également intervenir les droits garantis par les articles 7, 8, 9 et 10 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés. Pour sa part, le Procureur général a fait valoir que l'interdiction de prendre un vol commercial à laquelle a été soumise le défendeur ne restreignaient pas ses droits à la liberté ou à la sécurité, tels qu'interprétés par les tribunaux, étant donné qu'une telle interdiction ne s'apparente pas à une interférence avec des choix personnels fondamentaux ou ce qui constitue l'essence même de la dignité humaine, ni même avec une atteinte à l'intégrité psychologique d'un individu. Ce débat n'a pas été fait et aura lieu dans le cadre des deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire présentées par le défendeur. Pour cette raison, je m'abstiendrai de me prononcer sur cette question, directement ou indirectement, à l'occasion de la demande de non-divulgation.
[80]
Pour les fins de la présente discussion, il suffit de dire que les arguments du défendeur fondés sur la Charte ne sont pas dénués de tout fondement et ne peuvent pas être écartés du revers de la main. Par conséquent, cette Cour doit en tenir compte dans la pondération des intérêts en présence. Dans la mesure où la non-divulgation d'un renseignement pourrait compromettre non seulement le droit à l'équité procédurale mais également la possibilité pour le défendeur de faire valoir ses droits fondamentaux, il s'agira d'un facteur supplémentaire à considérer.
[81]
Ceci m'amène maintenant à traiter de façon plus détaillée des différentes informations dont on recherche la non-divulgation et sur lesquels le Procureur général et les
amici
n'ont pas réussi à proposer une solution commune. Le premier de ces documents est celui qui se trouve en annexe à la lettre envoyée par le sous-directeur du Service au sous-ministre des Transports en date du 3 septembre 2009, et qui se trouve à l'onglet xx de l'affidavit supplémentaire
ex parte
de xxx xxxxxxxxxx. Dans cette lettre, le sous-directeur du Service avise la sous-ministre des Transports, sous l'autorité de l'article 19 de la
Loi sur le Service canadien du renseignement de sécurité
, que le Service a acquis de l'information relative à la possibilité que M. Al Telbani soit relié à des activités criminelles et terroristes. L'information en question est jointe en annexe à la lettre. xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx

[83]
S'appuyant sur le témoignage du témoin du Service, le Procureur général a fait valoir trois raisons pour protéger xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx
[84]
En revanche, les
amici
ont soulevé plusieurs arguments à l'encontre de ces justifications. Ils ont tout d'abord soutenu que le Service xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx en se présentant chez M. Al Telbani le 2 juin 2008 et en l'interpellant sous son pseudonyme Mujahid Taqni. Xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx M. Al Telbani aurait confirmé avoir utilisé ce pseudonyme pour participer à des discussions sur des forums internet. xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx M. Al Telbani avec cette information et en misant xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxx pour ainsi l'inciter à mettre un terme à ses activités, le Service s'est donc trouvé à lui révéler implicitement l'intérêt qu'il lui portait et l'ampleur de son enquête. Cet argument me semble convainquant.
[85]
Les

ajoutent que le Service a également xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx. À ce chapitre, l'argument des

me semble moins convaincant.

[87]
En contrepartie, xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx constitue sans contredit une information importante dans le contexte du contrôle judiciaire sous-jacent. Il ne faut pas oublier que ce qui est contesté par M. Al Telbani, c'est la décision du Ministre d'inclure son nom sur la
Liste des personnes précisées
au motif qu'il constituait un danger pour la sûreté de l'aviation. xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx.
[88]
Il est vrai que M. Al Telbani est au courant de plusieurs des informations sur lesquelles on s'est appuyé pour ajouter son nom à la
LPP
, comme l'a soutenu le Procureur général. La lettre qu'a fait parvenir le sous-ministre adjoint à la sécurité et à la sûreté de Transport Canada à son avocate, le 10 juin 2009, énonce les facteurs qui seront pris en considération dans le cadre de la demande de réexamen présentée par M. Al Telbani:
• Que votre client bénéficie d'une formation technique relativement à la sécurisation des systèmes informatiques ( « Information Systems security »)
• Que votre client a fourni un support technique aux participants du site Internet Al Ekhlas dans le but d'assurer la sécurité de leurs communications et ce, en déjouant les systèmes de surveillance.
• Que votre client a participé, en utilisant le pseudonyme « Mujahid Taqni », à des discussions sur différents sites Internet relativement à la sécurisation des communications à l'encontre des systèmes de surveillance.
• Que les discussions et activités des forums de discussions sur internet ont pour objectif de fournir un support aux « mujahideen » terroristes qui combattent les pays européens et nord américains.
• Que votre client a créé et géré un périodique électronique Mujahid Taqni, publié sur le site Al Eklas, spécialisé dans le partage d'information sur des sujets d'importance pour les « mujahideen » terroristes tel que comment sécuriser les communications contre les systèmes de surveillance et comment commettre des actes de terrorisme notamment en relation avec la sûreté aérienne.
[89]
Ces informations, qui découlent en bonne partie de l'entrevue qu'avait eue le Service avec M. Al Telbani un an plus tôt, ne relient cependant pas explicitement ce dernier à des menaces à la sécurité aérienne. Le seul lien avec cette préoccupation qui se trouve dans la preuve publique réside dans un article publié dans le numéro du 20 février 2007 de la revue Al-mujahid taqni, dont le défendeur est l'éditeur, sous le titre « Smart weapons: Short-range ground-to-air missiles » (Dossier du défendeur, p. 244.12).
[90]
Il va sans dire que le fait xxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx ne suffit pas pour que soit respecté le principe de l'équité procédurale et pour lui permettre de faire valoir tous les arguments susceptibles de lui donner gain de cause eu égard à sa contestation de la légalité de la décision prise par Transport Canada. On ne peut exiger du défendeur qu'il spécule à propos des motifs qui ont pu entraîner la décision d'ajouter son nom à la
LPP
ou qu'il tente de contrer tous les faits qui ont pu être retenus contre lui à l'aveuglette.
[91]
Je suis donc d'avis xxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx constitue une information non seulement pertinente mais potentiellement extrêmement significative pour établir la légalité de la décision contestée par M. Al Telbani. Il se peut bien, comme l'a plaidé le Procureur général, que l'information qui fait déjà partie du dossier public soit suffisante pour établir que la décision de Transport Canada était raisonnable. Il se peut également que l'information dont on recherche l'exclusion s'avère en bout de ligne plus préjudiciable au défendeur qu'au demandeur dans le contexte du contrôle judiciaire. Il ne m'appartient pas de me prononcer sur ces questions. Pour les fins de la demande qui fait l'objet des présentes procédures, il me suffit de conclure que la non-divulgation xx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxx pourrait avoir des répercussions importantes sur l'issue du contrôle judiciaire et priver M. Al Telbani d'un argument important.

Les

ont porté à l'attention de la Cour une décision rendue par la Cour européenne de justice portant sur la compatibilité d'une ordonnance de contrôle (similaire à nos certificats de sécurité) avec la garantie d'équité procédurale prévue à l'article 6 de la
Convention européenne des Droits de l'Homme
. Dans cette affaire, la Cour a admis que la question de savoir si la preuve communiquée à l'individu visée était suffisante pour lui permettre de contester l'ordonnance devait être évaluée au cas par cas. La Cour s'est néanmoins dite d'avis que l'équité procédurale ne serait pas respectée dans l'hypothèse où la preuve de caractère public se résume à des assertions générales et que la décision de maintenir le certificat repose uniquement ou dans une mesure déterminante sur de la preuve secrète:
Affaire A. et autres c Royaume-Uni
(Requête no 3455/05), 19 février 2009, au para 220.
[93]
Bien que cette décision ne lie évidemment pas cette Cour et qu'elle s'applique dans un contexte juridique très différent du nôtre, elle n'en recèle pas moins des enseignements intéressants. Comme la Cour s'est fait fort de le rappeler, il n'est pas nécessaire qu'un individu connaisse le détail ou la source des éléments de preuve sur lesquels le décideur s'appuie pour prendre une décision. Ce qui importe, c'est que l'individu visé soit suffisamment informé de ce qu'on lui reproche pour être en mesure de faire valoir des arguments susceptibles de réfuter ces allégations. En l'occurrence, M. Al Telbani ne sait rien de ce qu'on lui reproche en rapport avec la sécurité aérienne si ce n'est l'allégation très vague dans la lettre mentionnée plus haut du sous-ministre adjoint à l'effet qu'il a « créé et géré un périodique électronique ...spécialisé dans le partage d'information sur des sujets d'importance pour les « mujahideen » terroristes tel que ...comment commettre des actes de terrorisme notamment en relation avec la sûreté aérienne ». On voit mal, sur la base de cette seule information, comment M. Al Telbani pourrait contester la décision qui a été prise de le placer sur la
LPP
en fournissant par exemple des explications quant xx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxx.
[94]
Est-ce à dire que cette information doit nécessairement lui être divulguée? Loin s'en faut. Les tribunaux ont indiqué à plusieurs reprises que l'équité procédurale ne requiert pas toujours la divulgation totale de la preuve, et que les exigences découlant des principes de justice fondamentale doivent être interprétées en fonction du contexte et n'exigeaient pas nécessairement la procédure la plus favorable qui puisse être imaginée: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paras 39 ss. Dans le cas présent, l'enjeu de la procédure sous-jacente n'est pas de la même amplitude que la privation de liberté qui découlerait d'une condamnation criminelle ou d'un certificat de sécurité. Bien que je ne minimise pas l'impact que peut avoir l'interdiction d'utiliser un vol commercial et que je n'exclue pas la possibilité qu'une telle interdiction puisse faire intervenir l'article 7 de la Charte, il n'en demeure pas moins que l'intérêt public dans la divulgation en pareil cas m'apparaît devoir céder le pas devant l'intérêt public de ne pas dévoiler une information qui pourrait avoir des répercussions très dommageables pour la sécurité nationale. Comme l'affirmait le juge McKay dans l'arrêt
Singh (J.B.) C Canada (Procureur general)
, [2000] F.C.J. No 1007 (au paragraphe 32), « The public interest served by maintaining secrecy in the national security context is weighty. In the balancing of public interest here at play, that interest would only be outweighed in a clear and compelling case for disclosure". Cette conclusion m'apparaît devoir s'imposer d'autant plus que le rôle du juge chargé de se prononcer sur une demande de contrôle judiciaire est bien différent de celui que doit assumer le juge chargé d'entendre un procès criminel ou une demande de réparation en matière civile. Je reviendrai sur cet aspect de la question un peu plus loin.

Plusieurs des documents dont on demande le caviardage contiennent par ailleurs un résumé du document xx ou réfèrent au fait xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx.

ont proposé de lever partiellement le caviardage de ces passages, de telle sorte que soit divulgué le fait que M. Al Telbani xxxxx xx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx seraient caviardées. Cette possibilité me paraît devoir être écartée, dans la mesure où M. Al Telbani xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx.
[96]
Les

ont fait valoir que cette information aurait pu être obtenue xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx . xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx Mais M.

[97]
La deuxième catégorie d'informations que l'on cherche à protéger, xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx
[98]
Les motifs invoqués à l'appui de la non-divulgation de cette information procèdent de la même logique que celle qui sous-tend l'exclusion du document xx. Dans les deux cas, la divulgation de l'information permettrait à M. Al Telbani xx xxxxxxxx xxx xx xxxxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx Étant donné l'importance de protéger les techniques d'enquête du Service, et malgré la pertinence de cette information aux fins d'établir la légalité ou l'illégalité de la décision prise par Transport Canada d'ajouter son nom à la
LPP
, je suis d'avis que cette information doit être protégée et qu'aucun résumé ne peut minimiser le préjudice pour la sécurité nationale. Par conséquent, je suis d'avis que le caviardage de cette information dans les documents 6, 8, 9, 14, 16, 18, 23, 27, 28, 29 et 30 doit être maintenu.
[99]
Les deux dernières informations que cherche à protéger le Procureur général émanent de tierces parties. La première aurait été transmise au Service par xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxxx. La seconde information a été communiquée au Service par xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx.
[100]
Le témoin du Service a concédé que l'essentiel de cette information apparaissait ici et là dans le dossier public, et tout particulièrement dans la lettre signée par le sous-ministre adjoint pour la sécurité et la sûreté dont j'ai reproduit plus haut (paragraphe 88) les extraits pertinents. On retrouve également cette information, quoique sous une forme différente, dans le sommaire de l'entrevue que le Service a eue avec M. El Telbani, ainsi que dans l'une des revues en ligne qui fait partie du dossier public, The Technical Mujahid, publié par le Al-Fajr Media Center, décrit comme « Al-Qaida's official online logistical network ». On a cependant fait valoir que l'information dont on recherche la non-divulgation est xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx.
[101]
Il est vrai que le nom des tierces parties impliquées n'apparaît nulle part dans les extraits que l'on veut protéger. Qui plus est, le témoin du Service a admis que l'on n'avait pas tenté d'obtenir le consentement de ces tierces parties à ce que l'information soit divulguée. Enfin, l'information en question est connue de M. Al Telbani et ne diffère pas de ce qui est déjà dans le domaine public; en fait, la lettre du sous-ministre adjoint à la sécurité et à la sûreté de Transport Canada reprend pour l'essentiel cette information. xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxx. Au surplus, la non-divulgation de cette information ne porterait pas préjudice à M. Al Telbani et ne l'empêcherait pas de contester efficacement les décisions qui font l'objet des deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire sous-jacentes à la présente procédure, étant donné qu'il est maintenant au courant de cette information par d'autres sources (notamment suite à la lettre du sous-ministre adjoint). Dans ces circonstances, et compte tenu de l'importance que revêt pour la sécurité nationale du Canada la nécessité de protéger la confidentialité des informations communiquées au Service par des tierces parties, j'estime qu'il y a lieu de faire droit à la demande de non-divulgation de ces informations.
[102]
xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxx. Pour toutes ces raisons, j'estime que le préjudice pour la sécurité nationale de divulguer l'information obtenue de tierces parties l'emporte sur le préjudice qu'entraîne la non-divulgation pour la publicité des débats judiciaires et le droit d'une personne de faire valoir sa cause.
[103]
Avant de mettre un terme à ces motifs, il convient de se pencher sur la possibilité qu'ont évoquée les
amici
et le Procureur général de minimiser le préjudice que pourrait entraîner pour M. Al Telbani la non-divulgation des renseignements visés par la présente requête en autorisant leur divulgation au juge qui sera chargé d'entendre les deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire. Tout en reconnaissant qu'une telle façon de procéder puisse trouver un certain appui dans la jurisprudence, les
amici
ont fait valoir que la Cour ne possédait probablement pas la compétence pour ordonner une telle mesure. Le Procureur général, pour sa part, a clairement indiqué que sa préférence était d'obtenir une ordonnance de non divulgation étanche mais qu'il n'était pas opposé à ce qu'un juge désigné chargé de se prononcer sur les demandes de contrôle judiciaire puisse consulter la preuve secrète en s'adjoignant même le concours d'un
amicus
pour l'assister dans cette tâche.
[104]
C'est la première fois qu'une telle façon de procéder est considérée, tout simplement parce que c'est la première fois qu'une demande de non-divulgation fondée sur l'article 38 de la
LPC
se greffe à une procédure judiciaire qui sera entendue au fond par un juge de cette Cour. Contrairement à la situation qui prévaut dans le contexte d'une procédure criminelle ou civile entendue par une cour provinciale (supérieure ou inférieure) dont les juges ne sont pas habilités à prendre connaissance de renseignements potentiellement préjudiciables à la sécurité nationale, rien ne s'oppose à ce que le juge saisi d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire à l'encontre d'une décision prise par un « office fédéral » au terme de l'article 18.1 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
soit un juge désigné conformément à l'article 38 de la
LPC
. Faut-il en conclure qu'il s'agit là d'une mesure de minimisation du préjudice dont il peut être tenu compte dans l'exercice d'équilibrage auquel nous convie l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ?
[105]
En matière criminelle, l'article 38.14 de la
LPC
autorise une cour à rendre toute ordonnance qu'elle estime nécessaire pour protéger le droit de l'accusé à un procès équitable. Cette disposition, qui s'avérait sans doute nécessaire pour assurer la constitutionnalité du régime mis en place par les articles 38 ss de la
LPC
, permet au juge du procès d'annuler certains chefs d'accusation ou encore de déclarer l'arrêt complet des procédures. Pour éviter cependant qu'une telle mesure soit prise inutilement et qu'un juge statue à tort que l'équité du procès sera compromise parce qu'il a un dossier incomplet entre les mains, le législateur a prévu un mécanisme permettant la divulgation au juge d'instance des renseignements qui pourraient être utiles pour assurer l'équité du procès. Comme l'affirmait la Cour suprême dans l'arrêt
R c Ahmad
, au para 31:
Nous devons présumer que le législateur était conscient de la possibilité qu'un arrêt des procédures soit inutilement prononcé si le juge du procès se voyait refuser l'accès à des renseignements ne pouvant être divulgués pour des raisons valides ayant trait au secret d'État. Vu les ressources considérables investies dans les enquêtes et les poursuites relatives aux infractions touchant la sécurité nationale, et l'injustice que causerait à la société un arrêt inutile des procédures dans les cas de cette nature, le législateur ne peut avoir voulu un tel résultat.
[106]
Ce mécanisme permettant de faire preuve d'une certaine souplesse dans l'application de l'article 38 se trouve au paragraphe 38.06(2) de la
LPC
, qui se lit comme suit:
Si le juge conclut que la divulgation des renseignements ou des faits porterait préjudice aux relations internationales ou à la défense ou à la sécurité nationales, mais que les raisons d'intérêt public qui justifient la divulgation l'emportent sur les raisons d'intérêt public qui justifient la non-divulgation, il peut par ordonnance, compte tenu des raisons d'intérêt public qui justifient la divulgation ainsi que de la forme et des conditions de divulgation les plus susceptibles de limiter le préjudice porté aux relations internationales ou à la défense ou à la sécurité nationales, autoriser, sous réserve des conditions qu'il estime indiquées, la divulgation de tout ou partie des renseignements ou des faits, d'un résumé des renseignements ou d'un aveu écrit des faits qui y sont liés.
[107]
Cette voie a d'ailleurs été empruntée dans l'arrêt
Canada (Procureur général) c Khawaja
, 2007 CF 490. À cette occasion, mon collègue le juge Mosley a, de façon exceptionnelle, communiqué aux avocats des parties un résumé des renseignements dont la divulgation avait été interdite en vertu de l'article 38, et il a ordonné que l'utilisation de ce résumé se limite aux procédures pénales et qu'il soit mis à la disposition du poursuivant et du juge du procès au cas il serait nécessaire de se prononcer sur l'équité du procès. Cette façon de procéder a reçu l'aval implicite de la Cour suprême dans l'affaire
Ahmad
(au para 44).
[108]
La Cour suprême a beaucoup insisté sur la souplesse du régime mis en place par l'article 38 dans l'arrêt
Ahmad
, et a même évoqué dans le passage qui suit la possibilité que soit communiqué au juge du procès les renseignements mêmes qui font l'objet d'une ordonnance de non-divulgation:
[45] Les problèmes que crée le partage des responsabilités entre les tribunaux peuvent être résolus de différentes manières. Par exemple, le juge de la Cour fédérale exerçant le pouvoir discrétionnaire conféré par le par. 38.06(2) pourrait estimer qu'il est possible d'autoriser la divulgation de renseignements au juge de la cour criminelle sans risquer de porter préjudice à la sécurité nationale, en posant comme seule condition que ce dernier ne divulgue pas les renseignements à l'accusé ou qu'il les examine dans un lieu protégé désigné. La divulgation des renseignements au juge du procès seulement, comme c'est la norme dans d'autres pays, et à seule fin de déterminer l'incidence de leur non-divulgation sur l'équité du procès, s'avérera souvent la solution la plus appropriée. Cela est particulièrement vrai si l'on tient compte du risque minimal que présente le fait de donner cet accès au juge présidant un procès, personne investie des pouvoirs et responsabilités d'une charge publique élevée.
[109]
Je note enfin que la Cour suprême a également mentionné la possibilité pour le juge du procès de nommer un avocat spécial opposé à la poursuite, qui pourrait être informé de la question au moyen d'une autorisation donnée par le procureur général en vertu de l'article 38.03. Bref, il ressort de la décision rendue par la Cour suprême dans l'arrêt
Ahmad
que le pouvoir discrétionnaire étendu conféré par l'article 38 doit être interprété de façon à favoriser la recherche d'un juste équilibre entre l'intérêt public en matière de secret d'État et l'intérêt public relatif à l'administration efficace d'un système de justice équitable.
[110]
Les
amici
ont soutenu que les modalités offertes au juge du procès pour moduler l'incidence de la non-divulgation et octroyer une réparation ne sont pas disponibles dans une procédure autre que criminelle, étant donné que l'article 38.14 ne trouve application que dans le cadre d'un procès criminel. Cette lecture restrictive de l'article 38 ne me paraît pas justifiée. Il est vrai que l'arrêt A
hmad
s'inscrivait dans un contexte criminel et soulevait la question de savoir si le Parlement pouvait constitutionnellement retirer aux juges qui président des procès criminels le soin de déterminer si des renseignements à l'égard desquels est invoquée la sécurité nationale devaient être divulgués, pour confier ce pouvoir aux juges de la Cour fédérale. Pourtant, une lecture attentive de cette décision révèle que la Cour n'entendait pas restreindre ses propos relativement à la souplesse de ce régime au seul contexte criminel, comme les extraits cités plus haut en font foi. Certes, il est vrai que l'article 38.14 ne s'applique qu'en matière criminelle. La présence de cet article peut cependant s'expliquer par la nécessité qu'a ressentie le Parlement de prévoir explicitement que le régime mis en place ne portait d'aucune façon atteinte au droit à un procès juste et équitable garanti par l'alinéa 11d) de la
Charte
.
[111]
Tel que mentionné plus haut, cette Cour est saisie pour la première fois de la question de savoir si l'information faisant l'objet d'une ordonnance de non-divulgation conformément à l'article 38.06 peut néanmoins être transmise, sous une forme ou sous une autre, au juge qui entendra la demande de contrôle judiciaire sous-jacente à la présente procédure. Le seul précédent en la matière est l'arrêt
Mikail et Procureur général du Canada
, 2011 FC 674, dans le cadre duquel le juge Noël devait notamment se prononcer sur une demande d'intervention du Comité de surveillance des activités de renseignement de sécurité (CSARS) pour pouvoir déposer à titre confidentiel et sous pli scellé devant le juge chargé du contrôle judiciaire d'une de ses décisions, des documents qu'il avait reçu hors de la présence de la plaignante. À cette occasion, le juge Noël a clairement envisagé la possibilité que le juge désigné saisi du contrôle judiciaire puisse tenir une audience
ex parte
et à huis-clos pour considérer les documents faisant l'objet d'une ordonnance de non-divulgation, sans s'attarder davantage sur les modalités d'une telle audition. Le juge qui a subséquemment entendu la demande de contrôle judiciaire a effectivement tenu une audience
ex parte
et à huis-clos, mais n'a pas davantage élaboré sur les documents non-divulgués dans la mesure où ils n'étaient pas pertinents pour trancher la demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[112]
Je note par ailleurs que le juge Mosley, dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a explicitement donné instruction aux
amici
nommés dans cette affaire d'identifier les documents qui pourraient faire l'objet d'une ordonnance autorisant la divulgation au juge chargé du procès, sous l'une ou l'autre forme prévue au paragraphe 38.06(2) de la
LPC
. Or, les procédures sous-jacentes dans cette affaire consistaient en des actions civiles intentées par plusieurs demandeurs devant la Cour supérieure de justice de l'Ontario pour réclamer des dommages-intérêts compensatoires du gouvernement du Canada pour la présumée complicité de ce dernier à l'égard de leur détention et de leur torture en Syrie et en Égypte et pour la violation de leurs droits constitutionnels: voir DES-1-11, en date du 19 septembre 2011. Cette ordonnance donne clairement à penser qu'aux yeux du juge Mosley, le paragraphe 38.06(2) donne le pouvoir au juge désigné de transmettre au juge chargé d'une instance civile l'information dont il ou elle a par ailleurs ordonné la non-divulgation.
[113]
Cette même approche me semble devoir être suivie dans la présente instance. Même si M. Al Telbani ne fait pas face à des accusations criminelles, les répercussions que peut avoir le maintien de son nom sur la
LPP
n'en sont pas moins importantes. Il se peut même que le juge qui entendra la demande de contrôle judiciaire en arrive à la conclusion que ses droits constitutionnels ont été enfreints. Dans ce contexte, il est impérieux que la demande de contrôle judiciaire soit tranchée sur la base de toute l'information qui était devant le décideur original. Les décisions de l'administration publique ne sauraient être à l'abri du pouvoir de révision des tribunaux supérieurs, et il importe que la légalité et la constitutionnalité de décisions qui peuvent avoir un impact considérable sur les administrés puisse être appréciée en tenant compte le plus possible de toute l'information pertinente. Il y va non seulement de l'intérêt du justiciable mais également de l'intérêt public. De la même façon que l'on ne saurait tolérer l'assujettissement d'une personne à une décision administrative illégale ou, pire, contraire aux droits et libertés fondamentales, il serait tout aussi dommageable pour nos institutions que l'exercice tout à fait légitime d'un pouvoir délégué soit annulé parce que le juge de révision n'a pas toute l'information à laquelle avait accès le décideur.
[114]
Bref, j'estime que la possibilité de nommer un juge désigné pour entendre une demande de contrôle judiciaire lorsque cette dernière porte sur une décision de l'administration fédérale augmente les possibilités qu'offrent le paragraphe 38.06(2) lorsque vient le moment de considérer les conditions de divulgation les plus susceptibles de limiter le préjudice porté à la sécurité nationale. S'il est possible d'envisager la divulgation de renseignements sensibles à un juge d'une cour provinciale, il doit
a fortiori
être souhaitable de transmettre une telle information à un juge désigné quand le contexte s'y prête. Ce faisant, l'on s'assurera que la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera traitée au mérite et ne sera pas rejetée ou accueillie faute d'information. Il serait tout aussi dommageable pour l'administration de la justice et la primauté du droit qu'une décision soit jugée raisonnable ou déraisonnable du seul fait qu'un juge n'ait pas en mains tous les renseignements dont disposait la personne qui a pris cette décision.
CONCLUSION
[115]
Dans les pages qui précèdent, j'ai examiné les renseignements que le Procureur général désire protéger à la lumière des critères développés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . J'en suis venu à la conclusion que, mis à part les renseignements qui pourraient identifier des employés du Service ou qui portent sur des détails administratifs, les renseignements expurgés sont pertinents eu égard aux deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire sous-jacentes. J'estime également que le demandeur s'est déchargé de son fardeau d'établir que la divulgation des renseignements expurgés causerait un préjudice à la sécurité nationale. Enfin, je suis d'avis que l'intérêt public dans la non-divulgation l'emporte, à des degrés divers, sur l'intérêt public dans la divulgation.
[116]
Ceci étant dit, il m'apparaît crucial dans le présent dossier que le juge chargé du contrôle judiciaire puisse prendre connaissance des renseignements expurgés pour pouvoir évaluer la légalité des décisions contestées, ou à tout le moins pour pouvoir déterminer s'il est possible de se prononcer sur cette question malgré l'ignorance dans laquelle se trouve M. El Telbani à l'égard de certains faits. Les demandes de contrôle judiciaire devront donc être entendues par un juge désigné. Il appartiendra à ce juge désigné de décider si des auditions
ex parte
et à huis clos doivent être tenus, et si un
amicus curiae
ou un avocat spécial doit être nommé pour l'assister dans sa tâche.
[117]
Les avocats du Procureur général et les
amici
devront soumettre des représentations écrites à la Cour le ou avant le 3 octobre 2014 si, à leur avis, les présents motifs et l'ordonnance confidentielle qui les accompagne (voir annexe B) renferment des renseignements sensibles ou potentiellement préjudiciables qui ne devraient pas être rendus publiques et, le cas échéant, ils devront indiquer quelle parties devraient être caviardées. Ces représentations devront préciser la nature du préjudice aux relations internationales ou à la défense ou à la sécurité nationale qu'une divulgation publique serait susceptible de créer.
