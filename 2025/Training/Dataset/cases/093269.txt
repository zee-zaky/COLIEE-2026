Pinard, J.
: By her application the applicant is seeking writs of certiorari and mandamus "or any other appropriate order or remedy" against the decision of the respondent Commission having No. Q11563.
[2]
This decision was communicated in the following letter, mistakenly dated April 18, 1990, instead of April 18, 1991, from the respondent to the applicant:
"April 18, 1990
Mrs. Brigitte Mercier
1980 rue de Bucarest
Vimont, Quebec
H7M 4W8
Dear Madam:
The Canadian Human Rights Commission has studied the complaint (Q11563) filed by you against the Canadian Penitentiary Service on January 25, 1988, alleging discrimination based on sex and disability in employment. The Commission has also noted your observations dated December 22, 1990.
The Commission has decided pursuant to s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
that in view of all the circumstances surrounding the complaint no further action is warranted.
The Commission has accordingly closed the file.
Yours truly,
(signed by)
Lucie Veillette"
[3]
The relevant provisions of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended, are as follows:
"43(1) The Commission may designate a person, in this Part referred to as an 'investigator', to investigate a complaint.
"44(1) An investigator shall, as soon as possible after the conclusion of an investigation, submit to the Commission a report of the findings of the investigation.
"44(2) If, on receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission is satisfied
(a) that the complainant ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available, or
(b) that the complaint could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, by means of a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act,
it shall refer the complainant to the appropriate authority.
"44(3) On receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission
(a) may request the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel to appoint a Human Rights Tribunal in accordance with s. 49 to inquire into the complaint to which the report relates if the Commission is satisfied
(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted, and
(ii) that the complaint to which the report relates should not be referred pursuant to subs. (2) or dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e); or
(b) shall dismiss the complaint to which the report relates if it is satisfied
(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is not warranted, or
(ii) that the complaint should be dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e).
"44(4) After receipt of a report referred to in subs. (1), the Commission
(a) shall notify in writing the complainant and the person against whom the complaint was made of its action under subs. (2) or (3); and
(b) may, in such manner as it sees fit, notify any other person whom it considers necessary to notify of its action under subs. (2) or (3)."
[4]
It was clearly established in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 385 at 902 S.C.R., that a decision such as the one affected by the application at bar, that is a decision made pursuant to s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the
Act
, is not one required to be made on a judicial or quasi-judicial basis. It is therefore a purely administrative decision, but one which, and there is no doubt as to this, remains fully subject to judicial review, its validity in law depending on conditions of a jurisdictional and also procedural nature.
[5]
At the hearing in this Court, counsel for the applicant limited her argument to breaches of the procedural rules of equity, mentioning first the fact that the comments of Correctional Services Canada on the investigation report required by s. 44(1) of the
Act
were not shown to the applicant prior to the Commission's decision, and then noting that in the circumstances, as that decision was contrary to the investigator's recommendation, the Commission erred in not giving reasons for it.
[6]
On the question of the consideration of evidence by the Commission when it has to make a decision pursuant to s. 44(3) of the
Act
(formerly s. 36(3)), Sopinka, J., for the majority said the following, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above at 899 and 900 S.C.R.:
"In my opinion, it is the intention of s. 36(3)(b) that this occur where there is insufficient evidence to warrant appointment of a tribunal under s. 39. It is not intended that this be a determination where the evidence is weighed as in a judicial proceeding but rather the Commission must determine whether there is a reasonable basis in the evidence for proceeding to the next stage. It was not intended that there be a formal hearing preliminary to the decision as to whether to appoint a tribunal. Rather the process moves from the investigatory stage to the judicial or quasi-judicial stage if the test prescribed in s. 36(3)(a) is met. Accordingly, I conclude from the foregoing that, in view of the nature of the Commission's function and giving effect to the statutory provisions referred to, it was not intended that the Commission comply with the formal rules of natural justice. In accordance with the principles in
Nicholson
, supra, however, I would supplement the statutory provisions by requiring the Commission to comply with the rules of procedural fairness. In this regard, I adopt the statement of Lord Denning, M.R., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  charged with duties similar to those of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In determining that it was an investigatory body with the duty to act fairly, Lord Denning said, at p. 19:
'In recent years we have had to consider the procedure of many bodies who are required to make an investigation and form an opinion ... In all these cases it has been held that the investigating body is under a duty to act fairly; but that which fairness requires depends on the nature of the investigation and the consequences which it may have on persons affected by it. The fundamental rule is that, if a person may be subjected to pains or penalties, or be exposed to prosecution or proceedings, or deprived of remedies or redress, or in some such way adversely affected by the investigation and report, then he should be told the case made against him and be afforded a fair opportunity of answering if. The investigation body is, however, the master of its own procedure. It need not hold a hearing. It can do everything in writing. It need not allow lawyers. It need not put every detail of the case against a man. Suffice it if the broad grounds are given. It need not name its informants. It can give the substance only. Moreover it need not do everything itself. It can employ secretaries and assistants to do all the preliminary work and leave much to them. But, in the end, the investigating body itself must come to its own decision and make its own report.'"
[7]
And at 902 and 903 S.C.R.:
"It is therefore appropriate to observe that had I determined that the decision of the Commission was reviewable, I would have concluded as Marceau, J., did that the Commission committed no reviewable error. I agree with the reasons of Marceau, J., that the Commission had a duty to inform the parties of the substance of the evidence obtained by the investigator and which was put before the Commission. Furthermore, it was incumbent on the Commission to give the parties the opportunity to respond to this evidence and make all relevant representations in relation thereto.
"The Commission was entitled to consider the investigator's report, such other underlying material as it, in its discretion, considered necessary and the representations of the parties. The Commission was then obliged to make its own decision based on this information. All this was done.
"Two matters require special comment. First, it is submitted that failure to give reasons is itself a basis for review. Assuming without deciding that this is so in the absence of a statutory requirement to give reasons (compare
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 706, and Lamer, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 500-501), in my opinion there is no basis for such review in this case. The appellant was notified that the Commission had decided that the positions which were the subject of comparison did not constitute work of equal value. The basis for this conclusion was the very extensive report of the investigator which the Commission adopted. This, the Commission was entitled by statute to do. The report which it adopted was in the hands of the appellant. Accordingly, the latter was fully apprised of the reasons for the Commission's decision. There is, therefore, no ground for suggesting that there was any denial of natural justice or procedural fairness in this regard."
[8]
In the case at bar, the Commission had an opportunity to consider and examine the following things;
- the investigation report and the details of the investigation;
- the copy of the complaint;
- the stages in which the complaint was processed;
- the copy of a letter to the applicant from the inmate Maurice A.;
- the applicant's comments on the investigation report;
- Correctional Services Canada's comments on the investigation report;
- the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal, file A-1071-88, dismissing Brigitte Mercier's appeal from the decision of the Public Service Commission Appeal Board made on October 17, 1988 by Mr. Guy St-Hilaire; and finally,
- the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal, file A-933-88, dismissing the appeal of Brigitte Mercier from the decision of the Public Service Appeal Board made on August 26, 1988, by Mr. Pierre Baillie.
[9]
It was further established that the full investigation report was given to the applicant before she made her comments to the Commission.
[10]
In view of all these facts, after reviewing all the relevant documentation and hearing counsel for the parties, I consider that this is a case in which the rules of procedural fairness as defined by Sopinka, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above were duly observed. It sufficed for the investigation report to be given to the applicant before the Commission's decision was made; it was therefore not necessary for the comments of Correctional Services Canada on the report to be given to her as well. Additionally, it is clear that if the legislature had intended that the Commission be required to give reasons for its decision pursuant to s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the
Act
when the latter was contrary to the investigator's recommendation, it would have clearly indicated this, as it expressly did in s. 42(1) for cases in which the Commission finds a complaint inadmissible on one of the grounds mentioned in s. 41. In the circumstances of the case at bar, the absence of reasons for the decision is no more a breach of procedural fairness than of the
Act
.
[11]
Finally, the following remarks of my brother Dubé, J., in
Jean Morisset
and Canadian Human Rights Commission and Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(Judgment of September 20, 1991, Federal Court of Canada, No. T-1937-91, at 5 and 6.) seem to me to be highly relevant:
"The
Act
provides a procedure to remedy discriminatory acts in certain areas within federal legislative jurisdiction. The first stage of the procedural requirements is the filing of a complaint. If the complaint does not fall under one of the exceptions mentioned in s. 41, the Commission may either appoint an investigator under s. 43 or a Tribunal under s. 49. In the first case, the investigator prepares a written report for members of the Commission containing an account of the relevant facts obtained during the investigation and his conclusions. This is exactly what occurred in the case at bar.
"The
Act
does not require that members of the Commission examine the complete record of the investigation. The
Act
does not provide for an oral hearing in the case of an investigation, but provides for written observations, unlike the investigation by a Tribunal, where the hearing takes the form of an adversary proceeding. The members of the Commission must decide based on the material before them whether the evidence provides reasonable justification for proceeding to the next stage (See
Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 898;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  employés de production du Québec et de l'Acadie
, supra, at 902 and
Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  they decided that there was no basis for proceeding to the second stage. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that this is a purely administrative decision (See
Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l'Acadie
, supra, at 899.)
"The
Act
does not require that the Commission's decision communicated to the applicant take a particular form and be accompanied by reasons when the complaint is dismissed. Under the provisions of s. 44(4), the
Act
provides that on receiving the report the Commission will inform the parties of the decision made in writing. The Supreme Court of Canada has already held in
Maple Lodge Farms
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 7 and 8.) that the Court should not intervene where a discretionary power has been exercised under the
Act
reasonably, in good faith, without reference to extraneous considerations and neither arbitrarily nor unlawfully."
[12]
In procedural terms, therefore, I consider that in the case at bar the administrative body acted fairly, and the applicant's action is accordingly without foundation. There can be no question here of any further inquiry as to the way in which the Commission exercised its discretion without giving a substantive content to the duty to act fairly which it is my function to ensure is performed. Finally, it is well established as a general rule that in the exercise of judicial review a superior court should not, where the situation simply requires an assessment of facts and credibility and there is no manifest error, assume the function of the administrative authority.
[13]
For all these reasons, I must dismiss the application with costs.
Application dismissed.
