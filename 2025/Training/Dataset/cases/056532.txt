Beaudry, J.
: This is an appeal under section 56 of the
Trade-marks Act
, RSC 1985, c T-13 [the Act] of two decisions by the Trade-marks Opposition Board [the Board] dated June 20, 2011, with respect to the applicant's application no 1,329,118 for the trade-mark CHINESE CHARACTERS DESIGN [the mark] (file T-1761-11) and with respect to the applicant's application no 1,329,117 for the trade-mark SAINT HONORE CAKE SHOP & CHINESE CHARACTERS DESIGN (file no T-1763-11). It is also an appeal of two decisions by the Board dated August 1, 2011, in which the Board corrected an omission it had made in the June 20, 2011 decisions. The decisions are hereinafter referred to collectively as "the decisions".
[2]
For ease of reference, the Court will indicate here the relevant facts, arguments and analysis which are different in files no T-1761-11 and T-1763-11.
[3]
For the reasons that follow, the appeals shall be dismissed.
Background
[4]
On December 13, 2006, the applicant filed an application to register the marks based on proposed use with the following wares:
(1) Metal containers for storage of food; tin-plate boxes and tin-plate containers for storage of food; metal boxes for preserving food; boxes made of common metal for storage of food; boxes made of paper or cardboard for packaging; wrapping, containers and bags for food.
(2) Adhesive tapes, labels of paper and tags for use with gift wrapping; ribbons; printed matter, namely menus advertising display boards of paper, advertising leaflets, posters and publications, namely, booklets and teaching materials in the field of food and drinks; brochures and catalogues.
(3) Coffee, tea, cocoa; bread, biscuits, cakes, cookies, moon cakes, pastry, candy, ice candy, chocolates, meat pies, egg cakes, New-Year cakes, puddings; ice cream, edible oils and fats; egg rolls, rice glue balls; buns; dumplings; rice-based snacks, glutinous rice dumplings; based snacks prepared from rice or cereals; sauces for cakes and pasta.
[5]
In file no T-1761-11, the English translation for the Chinese characters is SAINT HONORE. In file no T-1763-11, the English translation for the Chinese characters is SAINT HONORE CAKE SHOP.
[6]
On February 27, 2008, the respondent filed statements of opposition against the applications. The applicant served and filed counter statements in which it denied the respondent's allegations and put the respondent to the strict proof thereof.
[7]
The applicant did not file any evidence on the oppositions and only the respondent filed written arguments regarding the applications. Both parties attended the oral hearing for both applications on March 10, 2007.
The Decisions under Review
[8]
In file no T-1761-11, the Board refused the application in part, on June 20, 2011 (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). On August 1, 2011, it corrected a minor omission in that decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In T-1763-11, the application was refused in part on June 20, 2011 in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and corrected on August 1, 2011 in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[9]
With respect to both marks, the Board found that the applicant had not discharged its burden of showing, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the marks and the respondent's trade-marks with respect to the following wares [the overlapping wares] :
...wrapping, containers and bags for food; ...printed matter namely menus, advertising display boards of paper, advertising leaflets, posters and publications, namely, booklets and teaching materials in the field of food and drinks; ...coffee, tea, cocoa; bread, biscuits, cakes, cookies, moon cakes, pastry, candy, ice candy, chocolates, meat pies, egg cakes, New Year cakes, puddings, ice cream, edible oils and fats; egg rolls; rice glue balls; buns; dumplings; rice-based snacks, glutinous rice dumplings; based snacks prepared from rice or cereals; sauces for cakes and pasta
[10]
Therefore, the Board allowed the grounds of opposition based on paragraph 12(1)(d) of the Act with respect to the overlapping wares only.
[11]
It also found that the applicant failed to meet its burden under paragraph 16(3)(a) of the Act to establish no likelihood of confusion with the respondent's trade-marks, for which the respondent had established use prior to December 13, 2006 and non-abandonment as of January 9, 2008, with respect to the overlapping wares only. It is to be noted that in T-1763-11, the Board made the exact same finding, except that the date "January 9, 2008" was replaced by "February 13, 2008" (see para 133 of the decision).
[12]
Lastly, the Board found that the respondent met its burden under paragraph 38(2)(d) of the Act in establishing that its trade-marks had become known sufficiently to negate the distinctiveness of the marks prior to February 27, 2008, with respect to the overlapping wares only.
Relevant Legislation
[13]
The provisions of the Act relevant to these appeals are reproduced in annex.
I.
Preliminary Issue
Applicant's arguments
[14]
On appeal to this Court, the applicant filed the affidavit of Dr. Becky Xi Chen, sworn on November 25, 2011 [the Chen affidavit]. The applicant submits that the Court should accept the affidavit because it is relevant and is very important to its arguments. The applicant also alleges that there is no prejudice to the respondent and it is a counsel's error committed by inadvertence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Respondent's arguments
[15]
The respondent objects to the admissibility of this affidavit because Dr. Chen is being put forward as an expert witness by the applicant and she admitted on cross-examination that she had never seen or read the Code of Conduct for Expert Witnesses that is set out as a schedule to the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106 [the Rules]. As such, the affidavit does not comply with Rule 52.2(1)(c).
[16]
In the alternative, the respondent argues that the Court should accord little weight to the Chen affidavit, as it is hard to reconcile her statement in a subsequent affidavit dated November 19, 2012, that she has, at all times in relation to her retainer, acted in accordance with the Code of Conduct, when the opinions she gave in her affidavit comprise, at least in part, written submissions going to an issue in dispute in these matters.
Analysis
[17]
Rule 52.2(1)(c) requires that an expert's affidavit be accompanied by a certificate in Form 52.2, signed by the expert, acknowledging that the expert has read the Code of Conduct for Expert Witnesses set out in the schedule and agrees to be bound by it.
[18]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized the mandatory nature of the requirement.
That Rule sets out an exacting procedure that must be followed for the admission of expert evidence, a procedure that, among other things, is designed to enhance the independence and objectivity of experts on whom the courts may rely: see Rule 52.2(2) and the Code of Conduct for Expert Witnesses in the Schedule to the Rules.
[19]
Balancing the factors involved here, the Court is of the opinion that because Dr. Chen did not comply with Rule 52.2(1)(c), her affidavit is inadmissible. Dr. Chen's subsequent affidavit dated November 19, 2012 did not cure the defect in her initial affidavit sworn on November 25, 2011. As noted by the respondent, it is not in the interests of justice to make light of Rule 52.2 by permitting a witness to say nearly one year after preparing her expert evidence that she has complied with the Code of Conduct for Expert Witnesses after confirming on cross-examination that she had never seen or read it.
Issues
[20]
The appeals raise the following issues:
1. Did the Board err in allowing the grounds of opposition based on paragraph 12(1)(d) of the Act with respect to the overlapping wares?
2. Did the Board err in allowing the grounds of opposition based on paragraph 16(3)(a) of the Act with respect to the overlapping wares?
3. Did the Board err in allowing the grounds of opposition based on paragraph 38(2)(d) of the Act with respect to the overlapping wares?
VII. Standard of Review
[21]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 16, Justice Manson stated the following regarding the standard of review applicable on appeal if new evidence is filed before the Court.
14 Given new evidence was filed by the opponent in this matter that was not before the Opposition Board, the Court has an unfettered discretion to consider the matter and come to its own conclusion as to the correctness of the Board's decision, if the new evidence is significant and would materially affect the underlying decision: (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Thus, the real question for consideration by the Court is the nature and quality of the new evidence, and whether it materially affects the decision below, so that the standard is correctness, or whether the new evidence is not significant and would not materially affect the decision below, such that the standard of review is reasonableness and considerable deference should be given to the decision below (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 397; aff'd 2006 FCA 6 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Hughes also cited these paragraphs as authority on standard of review in this context.
[22]
The applicant maintains that the standard of review should be correctness. Whether based on a standard of reasonableness or correctness, the Court finds that the decisions at issue are reasonable and correct.
Evidence before the Board
[23]
Only the respondent filed evidence before the Board. It consisted of certified copies of registration numbers TMA480,506; TM354,194; TMA354,193 and TMA667,403 along with the affidavits of Ronald Cheung Sr., Ronald Cheung Jr. [the 2008 Cheung Jr. affidavit], Bill Joyce and Qing Xie [the Xie affidavit]. The applicant obtained an order for cross-examination of the respondent's witnesses but did not proceed with the cross-examination.
New Evidence
[24]
The only new evidence filed by the applicant on appeal is the Chen affidavit and the affidavit of Mr. Anthony Benevides sworn November 6, 2012. For the reasons above, the Court found the Chen affidavit to be inadmissible. But even if the Court is wrong on that determination, it agrees with the respondent that Dr. Chen is not qualified as an expert to provide her opinion regarding the evidence provided in the Joyce affidavit. Dr. Chen is not a statistician or otherwise qualified to provide an opinion on census information (para 55, respondent's record, volume 5, page 850). Therefore, little weight is given to her affidavit.
[25]
The new evidence filed by the respondent in these proceedings consists of an affidavit by Mr. Ronald Cheung Jr., sworn January 16, 2012 [2012 Cheung Jr. affidavit], and an affidavit by Ms. Jenny Kwan.
[26]
The 2012 Cheung Jr. affidavit updates the evidence submitted in the 2008 Cheung Jr. affidavit regarding the advertisement activities of the bakeries operated by the respondent and its licensee, which are directed at the Chinese community, as well as provides updated evidence regarding the annual individual customer transactions at the bakeries. The 2012 Cheung Jr. affidavit also mentions that in June and July 2010, the respondent distributed customer survey forms available either in English or in Chinese. The respondent received 2,259 survey forms in return, of which 1,905 were in Chinese and 354 in English.
[27]
Ms. Jenny Kwan is a resident of East Vancouver and has been the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of British Columbia for the riding of Vancouver - Mount Pleasant since 1996. In her affidavit, she states that many in the Chinese-Canadian business community use business cards written in Chinese, advertise in Chinese and display signs on retail stores and businesses in Chinese. Her business card as well as notices and newsletters she has published, also include written Chinese. She points to examples of written notices in which the names of MLAs and Members of Parliament including those who neither speak nor write Chinese have included their Chinese names.
Arguments and Analysis
1. Did the Board err in allowing the grounds of opposition based on paragraph 12(1)(d) of the Act with respect to the overlapping wares?
Applicant's arguments
[28]
The applicant submits there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between its marks and the respondent's trade-marks.
[29]
The applicant divides its argument into four sub-issues. First, the applicant submits the Board erred in finding that the average consumer of the respondent could read and understand Chinese characters. There was no evidence before the Board that supported this conclusion. Rather, the Board erroneously concluded that the ability to speak a Chinese language directly corresponded with the ability to read and understand the written Chinese language. At paragraphs 29 to 47 of its memoranda  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -11 and T-1763-11, the applicant submits that the evidence in Dr. Chen's affidavit supports a finding that the average consumer of the respondent cannot read and understand Chinese characters upon immediate first impression. However, for the reasons above
,
the Court found this affidavit to be inadmissible.
[30]
Second, the applicant maintains that none of the new evidence filed by the respondent in these appeals establishes that the average consumer of the respondent can read and understand Chinese characters. The statements contained in the Kwan and Cheung Jr. affidavits are personal opinions based on no substantiated factual basis. Moreover, the applicant submits that the following elements of Mr. Cheung Jr.'s and Ms. Kwan's evidence support the applicant's position:
- Mr. Cheung Jr. admitted that the respondent's advertising is always published with its name and address included in English;
- There is no factual basis to support Mr. Cheung Jr.'s estimate, based on his limited verbal interactions, that more of the respondent's customers are first generation rather than second generation Chinese. The mere fact that a person speaks Chinese does not mean that he is able to read and understand Chinese characters;
- Mr. Cheung Jr. himself is not fluent in the reading of Chinese characters, despite being born in Hong Kong, raised in the Chinese community in Vancouver and working in the family Chinese bakery business;
- Mr. Cheung Jr.'s statement in cross-examination that consumer response to Chinese language advertisement shows the respondent's customers' ability to read Chinese characters is inconsistent with his statement in his affidavit that most of the respondent's customers are either repeat customers or those who have heard of the business through word of mouth;
- While Ms. Kwan deals with many constituents who speak Chinese, she has no knowledge as to how many of the Chinese-Canadians with whom she meets can read and understand Chinese characters; and
- There is no evidence as to whether the respondent's customers, if able to read and understand Chinese characters, read simplified or traditional characters. Ms. Kwan herself was only educated in the traditional form of Chinese characters and she is generally unable to read simplified characters.
[31]
The applicant argues that on first impression, the average consumer of the respondent would view the Chinese characters in the marks, as well as the respondent's trade-marks, simply as Chinese character "designs" with no immediate associated sound and see very little similarity between the parties' marks.
[32]
Furthermore, the applicant maintains that Chinese characters may be used in association with a business for reasons other than conveying a written message. For example, they may be used to show that the store is associated with Chinese products and services, to show that services are available in Chinese and to respect the Chinese community. Therefore, the applicant underscores that it is most probable that the use of Chinese characters in the respondent's trade-marks is for indicating to consumers that the associated wares and services are of Chinese origin or that services are available in the Chinese language, rather than for actually directly communicating with consumers who read and understand the written Chinese language.
[33]
The third sub-argument advanced by the applicant is that its marks bear no resemblance to the respondent's English language trade-mark or the respondent's combined Chinese and English language trade-marks in appearance, sound or idea suggested.
[34]
Lastly, the applicant submits that from the perspective of a consumer who is unable to read and understand simplified Chinese characters, there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' marks, as the marks are easily distinguishable in appearance.
[35]
Furthermore, even if the average consumer of the respondent's wares and services is able to read and understand Chinese characters, the applicant's marks are clearly distinguishable from all of the respondent's trade-marks in sound and idea suggested. In T-1761-11, the applicant adds that its mark shares only two Chinese characters with the respondent's Chinese language trade-marks and that while its marks translate as "Saint Honore", the respondent's trade-marks translate as "Anna's Cake House". In 1763-11, the applicant submits its mark translates as "Saint Honore Cake Shop", a completely different meaning from the meaning of the respondent's trade-mark (which is "Anna's Cake House").
[36]
With respect to the actual sound of the parties' marks, the applicant suggests that its mark  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -11 transliterates as "sing on nah" and its mark in T-1763-11 transliterates as "sheng an na bing wu" while the respondent's Chinese character trade-marks transliterate as "on no bing uk" or "an na bin wu". When considered as a whole, the applicant argues the sounds in both files are clearly distinguishable.
Respondent's arguments
[37]
The respondent responds that the circumstances of the present cases are similar to those in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 77 [
Cheung Kong
], where, even in 1999, Justice Evans took judicial notice of the fact that there was a substantial Chinese community in Toronto and that the growth of the community was sufficiently recent that many of its members would understand Chinese characters. The respondent maintains there is no jurisprudence to support the applicant's engagement in the debate about whether Chinese-Canadians are sufficiently literate to read the characters contained in each of the applicant's trade-marks and the respondent's trade-marks. The only reasonable conclusion is that the average consumer at issue in these cases does read and understand Chinese characters sufficiently to recognize and understand the characters to which he or she has been exposed through the respondent's long history of use of the characters.
[38]
With respect to the surrounding circumstances under subsection 6(5) of the Act, the respondent first submits that the evidence that Ms. Kwan was actually confused when she saw the applicant's trade-marks is an important surrounding circumstance.
[39]
Second, the respondent maintains that the Court should not disturb the Board's finding that the paragraph 6(5)(a) factor of inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks and the extent to which they have become known favoured the respondent, as the applicant made no submissions on this factor.
[40]
Third, while the applicant's trade-marks were filed on the basis of proposed use in Canada and there is no evidence of use of the trade-marks in Canada, the respondent provided ample evidence of the extensive use of its trade-marks since 1974. Accordingly, the respondent submits the factor under paragraph 6(5)(b) of the length of time the marks have been in use favours the respondent.
[41]
Fourth, the respondent asserts that the Court should not disturb the Board's findings on the paragraph 6(5)(c) and (d) factors of the nature of the wares, services and trade, as the applicant made no submissions on this factor and the Board found the products sold by the parties overlapped.
[42]
Lastly, the respondent submits that as there was uncontradicted evidence before the Board on the issue of the pronunciation of the parties' trade-marks and the applicant has not filed any new relevant evidence on this point on appeal, the Board's findings on the degree of resemblance in the pronunciation should not be disturbed.
[43]
In any event, the respondent notes that the Xie affidavit attests to the fact that the stylized script in the applicant's trade-marks, which are not in the respondent's Chinese character marks is akin to comparing Times New Roman font to Arial font; that the characters of the respondent's Chinese character marks are the same as all but one of the characters in the applicant's marks and are in the same order; and that the marks are pronounced exactly the same except for the addition of the first character. Finally, the respondent submits that in Mandarin, the applicant's marks are pronounced as "sheng an na bing wu" and the respondent's marks are pronounced as "an na bing wu" and in Cantonese, as "sing on no bing uk" and "on no bing uk" respectively.
Analysis
[44]
Under paragraph 12(1)(d) of the Act, a trade-mark is not registrable if it is confusing with a registered trade-mark. Section 6 of the Act sets out how a trade-mark is confusing for the purposes of the Act. Pursuant to subsection 6(5), in determining whether a trade-mark is confusing, the Court or the Registrar, as the case may be, must have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including those specifically set out at subsection 6(5), namely:
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks or trade-names and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trade-marks or trade-names have been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks or trade-names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.
[45]
The test for confusion is, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
The test to be applied is a matter of first impression in the mind of a casual consumer somewhat in a hurry who sees the [mark], at a time when he or she has no more than an imperfect recollection of the [mark], and does not pause to give the matter any detailed consideration or scrutiny, nor to examine closely the similarities and differences between the marks.
[46]
As stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 15, the test is whether an average consumer would be confused:
To determine whether two trade marks are confusing one with the other it is the persons who are likely to buy the wares who are to be considered, that is those persons who normally comprise the market, the ultimate consumer.
[47]
In the present case, the Court is of the opinion that it was open to the Board to find that a substantial portion of the respondent's actual consumers would be able to read and understand Chinese characters. As noted by the Board, the Cheung Jr. and Sr. affidavits establish that the respondent targets the Chinese community in the Greater Vancouver area. The respondent has prominently displayed the Chinese characters of its trade
-
marks for decades in the Greater Vancouver area, including in the exterior signage of the bakeries of the respondent and its licensee, as well as in letterhead, envelopes, business cards, promotional wedding pastry cards, and an entry with a directory of businesses listed under their Chinese character names. The Cheung Jr. affidavit also demonstrates that the Chinese characters of the respondent's trade
-
marks are displayed prominently on its cake boxes, plastic bags and disposable paper pastry cup used to package the bakery products. The fact that the respondent uses Chinese characters consistently and in so many of its materials suggests that it believes many of its customers will be able to read and understand them (see
Cheung  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 77).
[48]
Moreover, the 2012 Cheung Jr. affidavit mentions a 2010 survey conducted by the respondent in June and July 2010 in which the respondent distributed customer survey forms available either in English or in Chinese. The respondent received 2,259 survey forms in return, of which 1,905 were in Chinese and 354 in English. The fact that 84% of the customers who filled out a survey could read and understand written Chinese lends further support to the Board's finding that a substantial portion of the respondent's actual consumers would be able to read and understand Chinese characters.
[49]
The Board was also entitled to find that the surrounding circumstances favoured the respondent. First, it was open to the Board to find that by virtue of the inclusion of the first two Chinese characters in the respondent's trade-marks, pronounced as "an na" in Mandarin and "on no" in Cantonese, which translate to "Anna", the respondent's trade-marks possess a somewhat greater degree of inherent distinctiveness than the applicant's marks. Furthermore, given evidence of substantial annual sales and moderate advertising expenses directed primarily to the Chinese community, the evidence demonstrated that the respondent's trade-marks had become known in the greater Vancouver area, particularly among the Chinese community.
[50]
Second, the Board did not err in finding that the factor regarding the length of time the parties' trade-marks had been in use overwhelmingly favoured the opponent. The applicant applied for trade
-
marks on the basis of proposed use in Canada and has not filed any evidence regarding the use of the marks in Canada. The respondent, on the other hand, filed substantial evidence to demonstrate that it and its predecessor in title have used its trade-marks for decades.
[51]
Third, it was open to the Board to find that the issue of the nature of the wares, services or business, as well as the nature of the trade, favoured the respondent with respect to the overlapping wares, given the direct overlap of food products.
[52]
Lastly, the Board was entitled to find that the parties' marks share some similarities in sound and in appearance. As noted by the respondent, there was uncontradicted evidence before the Board on the issue of the pronunciation of the parties' trade-marks and the applicant has not filed any new relevant evidence on this point on appeal. The evidence before the Board in the Xie affidavit was that the Chinese characters of the respondent's trade-marks would be pronounced as "an na bing wu" in Mandarin and "on no bing uk" in Cantonese. Ms. Xie stated that the Chinese characters of the applicant's mark in T-1763-11 would be pronounced as "sheng an na bing wu" in Mandarin and "sing on no bing uk" in Cantonese. With the only difference in sound being the word "sheng" in Mandarin and "sing" in Cantonese, it was entirely reasonable for the Board to find that the trade-marks share some similarities in sound.
[53]
As for the appearance of the marks, Ms. Xie submitted uncontradicted evidence that the differences between the styles of the Chinese characters in the parties' marks are similar to reading and understanding English language text in Arial font as compared to Times New Roman. The applicant has not filed any evidence that would justify disturbing the Board's finding that the trade-marks share some similarities in appearance.
[54]
Thus, considering the surrounding circumstances, it was reasonable for the Board to allow the grounds of opposition based on paragraph 12(1)(d) of the Act with respect to the overlapping wares.
2. Did the Board err in allowing the grounds of opposition based on paragraph 16(3)(a) of the Act with respect to the overlapping wares?
Applicant's arguments
[55]
The applicant submits that considering the new evidence filed in these appeals, the Board erred in finding that the applicant failed to meet its burden under paragraph 16(3)(a), as there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' marks.
Respondent's arguments
[56]
The respondent underlines that the material date for considering whether a party is entitled to register a proposed trade-mark under section 16 of the Act is the filing date of the application; in this case, December 13, 2006 for application 1,329,118, (at issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -11) and December 12, 2006 for application 1,329,117 (at issue in T-1763-11). Given that the likelihood of confusion did not change between December 2006 and June 20, 2011, which is the date of the Board's decision and the material date for considering whether a mark is confusing with a registered trade-mark, the respondent maintains that the applicant is not entitled to register its marks.
Analysis
[57]
The Board did not err by finding that the applicant failed to establish no likelihood of confusion between its marks and the respondent's trade-marks with respect to the overlapping wares, as the respondent clearly established use of its trade-marks prior to December 2006 and the applicant has not filed any evidence that the likelihood of confusion changed between December 2006 and June 20, 2011.
3. Did the Board err in allowing the grounds of opposition based on paragraph 38(2)(d) of the Act with respect to the overlapping wares?
Applicant's arguments
[58]
The applicant submits that given the Board's error in finding a reasonable likelihood of confusion, the Board erred in finding that the applicant's marks were not distinctive in respect of the overlapping wares.
Respondent's arguments
[59]
The respondent submits that as with the entitlement to registration grounds of opposition, the Board's rejection of the applicant's marks on the ground of distinctiveness flowed from its conclusion that there was a likelihood of confusion between the parties' trade-marks. The applicant's marks are not distinctive in that they do not distinguish the applicant's wares and services from the wares and services offered by the respondent, in view of the likelihood of confusion between the parties' trade-marks.
Analysis
[60]
In view of the evidence submitted, the Court accepts that it was entirely open to the Board to find that the respondent had succeeded in establishing that its trade-marks had become known sufficiently to negate the distinctiveness of the marks prior to February 27, 2008, which is the date the respondent filed its statement of opposition and the material date. The Board's finding on this ground flowed from its discussion of the respondent's evidence under the ground of confusion and it was open to the Board to find that the difference in material dates was not significant.
[61]
The Court requested the parties to try to come to an agreement for a lump-sum award as to the issue of costs. It had the benefit of their comments from their letter to the Court dated August 22, 2013. The applicant suggests $20,541.20 inclusive of HST while the total claimed by the respondent is $25,000.
[62]
As stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and reaffirmed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> "...the Court should favour lump sum orders. It saves time and trouble for the parties and it is a more efficient method for them to know what their liability is for costs". The Court agrees with that reasoning and in the exercise of its discretion shall award a lump sum for an amount of $22,500 for costs inclusive of HST for both appeals.
JUDGMENT
[63]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1) The appeals in Court files T-1761-11 and T-1763-11 be dismissed;
2) The applicant shall pay a lump sum for an amount of $22,500 inclusive of HST as costs to the respondent for both appeals.

(3) The use of a trade-mark causes confusion with a trade-name if the use of both the trade-mark and trade-name in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with the trade-mark and those associated with the business carried on under the trade-name are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or services are of the same general class.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appel fondé sur l'article 56 de la
Loi sur les marques de commerce
, L R C (1985), c T-13 [la Loi] et visant deux décisions rendues par la Commission des oppositions des marques de commerce [la Commission], le 20 juin 2011, concernant les demandes no 1,329,118 et no 1,329,117, produites par la demanderesse en vue de l'enregistrement d'une marque de commerce composée de caractères chinois [la marque de commerce] (dossier T-1761-11) et de la marque de commerce SAINT HONORE CAKE SHOP & dessin de caractères chinois (dossier T-1763-11), respectivement. La Cour est également saisie de l'appel de deux décisions rendues par la Commission, le 1er août 2011, dans lesquelles cette dernière a rectifié une omission dans les décisions du 20 juin 2011. Les décisions sont ci-après désignées collectivement « les décisions ».
[2]
Pour faciliter la lecture, la Cour exposera les faits pertinents, les arguments et les analyses qui s'attachent à chacun des dossiers T-1761-11 et T-1763-11.
[3]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, les appels sont rejetés.
CONTEXTE
[4]
Le 13 décembre 2006, la demanderesse a produit des demandes en vue de l'enregistrement des marques de commerce, lesquelles étaient fondées sur un emploi projeté des marques en liaison avec les marchandises suivantes:
(1) Contenants en métal pour l'entreposage d'aliments; boîtes et contenants en fer-blanc pour l'entreposage d'aliments; boîtes en métal pour la conservation d'aliments; boîtes en métal commun pour l'entreposage d'aliments; boîtes en papier ou en carton pour l'emballage; emballages, contenants et sacs pour aliments.
(2) Rubans adhésifs, étiquettes en papier et étiquettes pour utilisation avec papier d'emballage de cadeaux; rubans; imprimés, nommément menus, panneaux d'affichage publicitaires en papier, feuillets publicitaires, affiches et publications, nommément livrets et matériel didactique dans le domaine des aliments et des boissons; brochures et catalogues.
(3) Café, thé, cacao, pain, biscuits secs, gâteaux, biscuits, gâteaux de lune, pâte à tarte, bonbons, friandises glacées, chocolats, pâtés à la viande, gâteaux aux œufs, gâteau du Nouvel An, crèmes-desserts, crème glacée, huiles et graisses alimentaires, pâtés impériaux, boules de riz gluant, brioches, dumplings, grignotines à base de riz, dumplings de riz glutineux, grignotines à base de riz ou de céréales, sauces pour gâteaux et pâtes alimentaires.
[5]
Dans le dossier no T-1761-11, la traduction anglaise des caractères chinois est « SAINT HONORE », alors que dans le dossier no T-1763-11, elle est « SAINT HONORE CAKE SHOP ».
[6]
Le 27 février 2008, la défenderesse a produit des déclarations d'opposition à l'encontre des demandes. La demanderesse a signifié et produit une contre-déclaration dans laquelle elle nie les allégations de la défenderesse et invite cette dernière à en démontrer le bien-fondé.
[7]
La demanderesse n'a présenté aucun élément de preuve concernant les déclarations d'opposition, et seule la défenderesse a présenté des arguments écrits concernant les demandes. Les deux parties ont comparu à l'audience sur les deux demandes tenue le 10 mars 2007.
Les décisions contrôlées
[8]
S'agissant du dossier no T-1761-11, la Commission a rejeté en partie la demande, le 20 juin 2011 (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le 1er août 2011, la Commission a rectifié une omission mineure dans la décision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Quant au dossier no T-1763-11, la demande a été rejetée en partie le 20 juin 2011 dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  décision qui a été corrigée le 1er août 2011 dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[9]
Relativement aux deux marques de commerce, la Commission a conclu que la demanderesse ne s'était pas acquittée du fardeau qui lui incombait d'établir, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il n'existait aucune probabilité raisonnable de confusion entre les marques en cause et les marques de commerce de la défenderesse au sujet des marchandises suivantes [les marchandises semblables]:
[...] emballages, contenants et sacs pour aliments; [...] imprimés, nommément menus, panneaux d'affichage publicitaires en papier, feuillets publicitaires, affiches et publications, nommément livrets et matériel didactique dans le domaine des aliments et des boissons; [...] café, thé, cacao, pain, biscuits secs, gâteaux, biscuits, gâteaux de lune, pâte à tarte, bonbons, friandises glacées, chocolats, pâtés à la viande, gâteaux aux œufs, gâteau du Nouvel An, crèmes-desserts, crème glacée, huiles et graisses alimentaires, pâtés impériaux, boules de riz gluant, brioches, dumplings, grignotines à base de riz, dumplings de riz glutineux, grignotines à base de riz ou de céréales, sauces pour gâteaux et pâtes alimentaires.
[10]
Par conséquent, la Commission a fait droit aux motifs d'opposition fondés sur l'alinéa 12(1)
d
) de la Loi, mais seulement en ce qui concerne les marchandises semblables.
[11]
La Commission a aussi conclu que la demanderesse ne s'était pas acquittée du fardeau que lui imposait l'alinéa 16(3)
a
) de la Loi d'établir qu'il n'existait aucune probabilité de confusion avec les marques de commerce de la défenderesse - laquelle avait démontré qu'elle employait ses marques avant le 13 décembre 2006 et qu'elle ne les avait pas abandonnées au 9 janvier 2008 - mais seulement en ce qui concerne les marchandises semblables. Il convient de mentionner que dans le dossier no T-1763-11, la Commission est arrivée à la même conclusion, sous réserve de la date du « 9 janvier 2008 » qui a été remplacée par le « 13 février 2008 » (voir le paragraphe 133 de la décision).
[12]
En dernier lieu, la Commission a conclu que la défenderesse s'était acquittée du fardeau imposé par l'alinéa 38(2)
d
) de la Loi d'établir que ses marques de commerce étaient devenues suffisamment connues pour annuler le caractère distinctif des marques avant le 27 février 2008, mais seulement en ce qui concerne les marchandises semblables.
Dispositions législatives pertinentes
[13]
Les dispositions de la Loi qui sont pertinentes pour les présents appels sont reproduites en annexe.
I.
QUESTION PRÉLIMINAIRE
Arguments de la demanderesse
[14]
En appel devant notre Cour, la demanderesse a présenté l'affidavit de Mme Becky Xi Chen, souscrit le 25 novembre 2011 [l'affidavit de Chen]. Elle soutient que la Cour devrait admettre cet affidavit parce qu'il est pertinent et d'une grande importance pour son argumentation. Elle prétend en outre que cela ne cause aucun préjudice à la défenderesse et qu'il s'agit d'une erreur que son avocat a commise par inadvertance (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Arguments de la défenderesse
[15]
La défenderesse conteste l'admissibilité de cet affidavit parce que Mme Chen, qui est présentée comme un témoin expert par la demanderesse, a admis en contre-interrogatoire qu'elle n'avait jamais vu ou lu le
Code de déontologie régissant les témoins experts
qui figure en annexe des
Règles des Cours fédérales
(DORS/98-106) [les Règles]. Ledit affidavit n'est donc pas conforme à l'alinéa 52.2(1)
c
).
[16]
À titre subsidiaire, la défenderesse fait valoir que la Cour devrait accorder peu de poids à l'affidavit de Chen puisqu'il est difficile de concilier la déclaration que Mme Chen y fait avec celle contenue dans l'affidavit que celle-ci a souscrit le 19 novembre 2012, à savoir qu'elle avait toujours agi, à l'égard de la personne qui a retenu ses services, conformément au Code de déontologie, alors que les opinions exprimées dans l'affidavit comportaient, du moins en partie, des observations écrites concernant une question en litige dans cette affaire.
Analyse
[17]
L'alinéa 52.2(1)
c
) dispose que l'affidavit d'un témoin expert doit être accompagné d'un certificat, selon la formule 52.2, signé par lui, reconnaissant qu'il a lu le Code de déontologie régissant les témoins experts établi à l'annexe et qu'il accepte de s'y conformer.
[18]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 42, la Cour d'appel fédérale a souligné le caractère obligatoire de cette exigence.
La règle prévoit une procédure exigeante qui doit être suivie par quiconque veut faire admettre une preuve d'expert, une procédure qui, entre autres, est conçue pour favoriser l'indépendance et l'objectivité des experts sur lesquels les cours peuvent s'appuyer: (voir la règle 52.2(2) et le
Code de déontologie régissant les témoins experts
figurant en annexe des Règles).
[19]
Après avoir pondéré les facteurs applicables en l'espèce, la Cour estime que Mme Chen n'a pas respecté l'alinéa 52.2(1)
c
), et que pour cette raison, son affidavit est inadmissible. L'affidavit du 19 novembre 2012 n'a pas remédié au vice du premier affidavit souscrit le 25 novembre 2011. Comme l'a indiqué la défenderesse, il serait contraire aux intérêts de la justice de réduire la portée de l'article 52.2 en permettant au témoin de déclarer, environ un an après avoir préparé sa preuve d'expert, qu'elle a respecté le
Code de déontologie régissant les témoins experts
après avoir confirmé en contre-interrogatoire qu'elle ne l'avait jamais vu ou lu.
Questions en litige
[20]
Les appels soulèvent les questions suivantes:
1. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en faisant droit aux motifs d'opposition fondés sur l'alinéa 12(1)
d
) de la Loi pour ce qui concerne les marchandises semblables?
2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en faisant droit aux motifs d'opposition fondés sur l'alinéa 16(3)
a
) de la Loi pour ce qui concerne les marchandises semblables?
3. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en faisant droit aux motifs d'opposition fondés sur l'alinéa 38(2)
d
) de la Loi pour ce qui concerne les marchandises semblables?
VII. Norme de contrôle
[21]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 16, le juge Manson a déclaré ce qui suit relativement à la norme de contrôle applicable en appel si de nouveaux éléments de preuve sont déposés à la Cour.
14 Étant donné que, dans la présente affaire, l'opposant a déposé de nouveaux éléments de preuve qui n'avaient pas été présentés à la Commission des oppositions, la Cour possède un pouvoir discrétionnaire absolu d'apprécier l'affaire et de tirer sa propre conclusion quant au bien-fondé de la décision de la Commission des oppositions, si les nouveaux éléments de preuve sont importants au point d'avoir une incidence réelle sur la décision sous-jacente: (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Mattel Inc c. 3894207 Canada Inc
, 2006 CSC 22, aux paragraphes 35 et 37).
15 Toutefois, lorsque de nouveaux éléments de preuve importants sont ajoutés en appel, la norme de contrôle est celle de la décision raisonnable simpliciter (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Ainsi, la question concrète pour la Cour est d'apprécier la nature et la qualité des nouveaux éléments de preuve et de déterminer s'ils ont une incidence prépondérante sur la décision, auquel cas la norme de contrôle est la décision correcte, ou s'ils ne sont pas importants et n'ont pas d'effet sur la décision visée par l'appel, auquel cas la norme de contrôle est la raison et il convient de faire preuve d'une déférence considérable à l'égard de la décision visée par l'appel (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; confirmé par 2006 CAF 6 (CAF))
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Hughes a également cité ces paragraphes pour justifier la norme de contrôle applicable dans cette affaire.
[22]
La demanderesse soutient que la norme de contrôle devrait être celle de la décision correcte. Que la norme applicable soit celle de la raisonnabilité ou celle de la décision correcte, la Cour estime que les décisions en cause sont raisonnables et correctes.
Preuve présentée à la Commission
[23]
Seule la défenderesse a présenté une preuve à la Commission, soit des copies certifiées conformes des enregistrements numéros LMC480,506, LMC354,194, LMC354,193 et LMC667,403, et les affidavits de Ronald Cheung Sr., Ronald Cheung Jr. [l'affidavit de Cheung Jr. de 2008], de Bill Joyce et de Qing Xie [l'affidavit de Xie]. La demanderesse a demandé et obtenu une ordonnance l'autorisant à contre-interroger les témoins de la défenderesse, mais n'a pas procédé à ces contre-interrogatoires.
Nouveaux éléments de preuve
[24]
Les seuls nouveaux éléments de preuve présentés en appel par la demanderesse sont l'affidavit de Chen et l'affidavit souscrit par M. Anthony Benevides le 6 novembre 2012. Pour les motifs susmentionnés, la Cour a conclu que l'affidavit de Chen était inadmissible. Or, même si elle se trompe sur ce point, la Cour convient avec la défenderesse que Mme Chen n'est pas reconnue comme experte et ne peut exprimer son opinion sur les éléments de preuve contenus dans l'affidavit de Joyce. Mme Chen n'est ni statisticienne ni autrement compétente pour exprimer une opinion sur des données du recensement (par. 55, dossier de la défenderesse, volume 5, page 850). Par conséquent, la Cour n'accorde que peu de poids à son affidavit.
[25]
Les nouveaux éléments de preuve présentés par la défenderesse en l'espèce sont un affidavit souscrit par M. Ronald Cheung Jr., le 16 janvier 2012 [affidavit de Cheung Jr. de 2012], et un affidavit de Mme Jenny Kwan.
[26]
L'affidavit de Cheung Jr. de 2012 met à jour les renseignements contenus dans l'affidavit de Cheung Jr. de 2008 au sujet des activités publicitaires des boulangeries exploitées par la défenderesse et le licencié de cette dernière, activités qui s'adressent à la collectivité chinoise, et met à jour les renseignements sur les ventes annuelles des boulangeries. L'affidavit de Cheung Jr. de 2012 mentionne aussi qu'en juin et juillet 2010, la défenderesse a distribué des formulaires de sondage auprès de la clientèle, disponibles en anglais et en chinois. La défenderesse a reçu 2 259 formulaires remplis, dont 1 905 en chinois et 354 en anglais.
[27]
Madame Jenny Kwan est une résidente d'East Vancouver et est députée à l'Assemblée législative de la Colombie-Britannique pour la circonscription de Vancouver - Mount Pleasant depuis 1996. Dans son affidavit, elle déclare que de nombreuses personnes du milieu des affaires sino-canadien utilisent des cartes professionnelles en chinois, font de la publicité en chinois et ont des affiches en chinois dans les magasins et les entreprises. Sa carte professionnelle et les avis et bulletins d'information qu'elle a publiés comportent aussi des caractères chinois. Elle donne des exemples de certains députés à l'Assemblée législative et députés fédéraux, y compris ceux qui ne parlent pas et n'écrivent pas le chinois, qui indiquent leurs noms en caractères chinois dans les avis.
Arguments et analyse
1. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en faisant droit aux motifs d'opposition fondés sur l'alinéa 12(1)
d
) de la Loi pour ce qui concerne les marchandises semblables?
Arguments de la demanderesse
[28]
La demanderesse affirme qu'il n'y a aucune probabilité raisonnable de confusion entre ses marques de commerce et les marques de commerce de la défenderesse.
[29]
La demanderesse divise ses arguments en quatre sous-questions. En premier lieu, la demanderesse affirme que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que le client moyen de la défenderesse pouvait lire et comprendre les caractères chinois. La Commission n'avait aucun élément de preuve pour arriver à cette conclusion. La Commission a conclu à tort qu'une personne qui parle le chinois est automatiquement en mesure de lire et de comprendre les caractères chinois. Aux paragraphes 29 à 47 des mémoires qu'elle a versés aux dossiers T-1761-11 et T-1763-11, la demanderesse affirme que les éléments de preuve contenus dans l'affidavit de Mme Chen appuient la conclusion selon laquelle le client moyen de la défenderesse ne peut lire et comprendre les caractères chinois à la première impression. Cependant, pour les motifs susmentionnés, la Cour a conclu que cet affidavit était inadmissible.
[30]
En deuxième lieu, la demanderesse prétend qu'aucun nouvel élément de preuve présenté par la défenderesse en l'espèce ne démontre que le client moyen de la défenderesse peut lire et comprendre les caractères chinois. Les déclarations contenues dans les affidavits de Kwan et de Cheung Jr. sont des opinions personnelles qui ne se fondent sur aucun fait corroboré. En outre, la demanderesse soutient que les éléments suivants tirés des témoignages de M. Cheung Jr. et de Mme Kwan confirment sa prétention:
- M. Cheung Jr. a admis que les annonces publicitaires de la défenderesse comportent toujours son nom et adresse en anglais;
- Aucune base factuelle n'étaye l'opinion de M. Cheung Jr., fondée sur ses interactions verbales limitées, selon laquelle un grand nombre de clients de la défenderesse sont des immigrants chinois de première génération plutôt que de deuxième génération. Le fait qu'une personne soit en mesure de parler le chinois ne signifie pas qu'elle peut aussi lire et comprendre les caractères chinois.
- M. Cheung Jr. a lui-même de la difficulté à lire les caractères chinois, même s'il est né à Hong Kong, a grandi au sein de la collectivité chinoise de Vancouver et travaille dans la boulangerie chinoise de sa famille;
- M. Cheung Jr. a déclaré en contre-interrogatoire que la réaction des consommateurs aux annonces publicitaires en chinois montre que les clients de la défenderesse peuvent lire les caractères chinois, ce qui est incompatible avec la déclaration qu'il a faite dans son affidavit selon laquelle la plupart des clients de la défenderesse sont des clients réguliers ou des clients qui ont découvert l'entreprise au moyen du bouche-à-oreille;
- Bien que Mme Kwan communique avec un grand nombre d'électeurs qui parlent chinois, elle ne sait pas combien de Canadiens d'origine chinoise avec qui elle communique peuvent lire et comprendre les caractères chinois;
- La preuve ne permet pas de savoir si les clients de la défenderesse, dans la mesure où ils peuvent lire et comprendre les caractères chinois, lisent les caractères traditionnels ou simplifiés. Mme Kwan a appris le chinois traditionnel et elle n'est généralement pas en mesure de lire les caractères simplifiés.
[31]
La demanderesse fait valoir que, à la première impression, le consommateur moyen de la défenderesse considérerait les caractères chinois composant les marques et les marques de commerce de la défenderesse comme des « dessins » de caractères chinois sans les associer immédiatement au son, et verrait très peu de similitudes entre les marques des parties.
[32]
En outre, la demanderesse affirme que les caractères chinois peuvent être utilisés par une entreprise pour des motifs autres que celui de transmettre un message écrit. Par exemple, ils peuvent être utilisés pour démontrer que le magasin offre des produits et services chinois, pour démontrer que les services sont disponibles en chinois ou par respect pour la collectivité chinoise. Par conséquent, la demanderesse souligne qu'il est probable que l'utilisation de caractères chinois dans les marques de commerce de la défenderesse vise à indiquer aux consommateurs que les marchandises et les services associés sont d'origine chinoise ou que les services sont offerts en chinois plutôt qu'à communiquer directement avec les consommateurs qui lisent et comprennent les caractères chinois.
[33]
Le troisième argument de la demanderesse est que ses marques n'ont aucune ressemblance avec la marque de commerce en anglais de la défenderesse ou les marques de commerce en anglais et chinois de la défenderesse dans la présentation ou le son ou dans les idées qu'elles suggèrent.
[34]
En dernier lieu, la demanderesse soutient que, du point de vue d'un consommateur qui ne peut lire et comprendre les caractères chinois simplifiés, il n'y a pas de probabilité raisonnable de confusion entre les marques des parties puisqu'elles se distinguent facilement dans leur présentation.
[35]
En outre, même si le client moyen qui achète les marchandises et les services de la défenderesse est en mesure de lire et de comprendre les caractères chinois, il est facile de distinguer les marques de la demanderesse des marques de commerce de la défenderesse compte tenu du son et des idées qu'elles suggèrent. Dans le dossier T-1761-11, la demanderesse ajoute que ses marques et les marques de commerce en chinois de la défenderesse ont seulement deux caractères chinois en commun et que la traduction de ses marques est « Saint Honore », alors que la traduction des marques de commerce de la défenderesse est « Anna's Cake House ». Dans le dossier 1763-11, la demanderesse affirme que la traduction de sa marque est « Saint Honore Cake Shop », ce qui est totalement différent de la marque de commerce de la défenderesse (dont la traduction est « Anna's Cake House »).
[36]
S'agissant du son des marques de commerce des parties, la demanderesse fait valoir que la translittération de sa marque dans le dossier T-1761-11 est « sing on nah » alors qu'elle est, dans le dossier T-1763-11, « sheng an na bing wu », et que la translittération des mots contenus dans les marques de commerce chinoises de la défenderesse est « on no bing uk » ou « an na bin wu ». La demanderesse affirme que, dans l'ensemble, les sons se distinguent facilement dans les deux cas.
Arguments de la défenderesse
[37]
La défenderesse répond que les circonstances des présentes affaires sont semblables à celles dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par. 77 [
Cheung Kong
], où déjà en 1999, le juge Evans prenait note du fait qu'il y avait une communauté chinoise importante à Toronto et que la plupart des membres de la collectivité étaient des immigrants récents, et que, par conséquent, beaucoup de membres de la collectivité comprenaient les caractères chinois. La défenderesse affirme que rien dans la jurisprudence ne justifiait la demanderesse de s'engager dans un débat sur la question de savoir si les Canadiens d'origine chinoise sont suffisamment en mesure de lire les caractères contenus dans les marques de commerce de la demanderesse et celles de la défenderesse. La seule conclusion raisonnable possible est que le consommateur moyen dont il est question en l'espèce peut lire et comprendre les caractères chinois suffisamment pour reconnaître et comprendre ceux auxquels il a été exposé pendant la longue période pendant laquelle la défenderesse les a utilisés.
[38]
Quant aux circonstances de l'espèce énumérées au paragraphe 6(5) de la Loi, la défenderesse affirme, en premier lieu, que le fait que les marques de commerce de la demanderesse aient semé la confusion dans l'esprit de Mme Kwan est une circonstance de l'espèce importante.
[39]
En deuxième lieu, la défenderesse soutient que la Cour ne devrait pas infirmer la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle le facteur énoncé à l'alinéa 6(5)
a
), le caractère distinctif inhérent des marques de commerce et la mesure dans laquelle elles sont devenues connues, favorisait la défenderesse puisque la demanderesse n'a pas présenté d'observations à cet égard.
[40]
En troisième lieu, alors que la demande d'enregistrement des marques de commerce de la demanderesse reposait sur un emploi projeté au Canada et qu'aucun élément de preuve n'indiquait qu'elles avaient été employées au Canada, la défenderesse a en revanche présenté suffisamment d'éléments de preuve de l'emploi étendu de ses marques de commerce depuis 1974. Par conséquent, la défenderesse soutient que le facteur énoncé à l'alinéa 6(5)
b
), la période pendant laquelle les marques de commerce ont été employées, joue en sa faveur.
[41]
En quatrième lieu, la défenderesse affirme que la Cour ne devrait pas infirmer les conclusions tirées par la Commission sur les facteurs énoncés aux alinéas 6(5)
c
) et
d
), touchant au genre de marchandises, services et entreprises, puisque la demanderesse n'a pas présenté d'observations à cet égard et que la Commission a conclu que les produits vendus par les parties se chevauchaient.
[42]
En dernier lieu, la défenderesse affirme que, puisque la Commission disposait d'une preuve non contredite sur la question de la prononciation des marques de commerce des parties et que la demanderesse n'a présenté aucun nouvel élément de preuve pertinent sur ce point en appel, les conclusions de la Commission sur le degré de ressemblance de la prononciation ne devraient pas être infirmées.
[43]
Dans tous les cas, la défenderesse fait valoir que de constater, comme le fait l'affidavit de Xie, que les caractères stylisés employés dans les marques de commerce de la demanderesse ne se trouvent pas dans les marques de commerce en caractères chinois de la défenderesse, revient à comparer la police Times New Roman avec la police Arial, que les caractères dans les marques de commerce en caractères chinois de la défenderesse sont les mêmes, sauf pour un, que les caractères dans les marques de commerce de la demanderesse, et qu'ils sont dans le même ordre, et que la prononciation des marques de commerce est identique, à l'exception du fait qu'on a ajouté le premier caractère. En dernier lieu, la défenderesse affirme que les marques de commerce de la demanderesse et celles de la défenderesse se prononcent en mandarin « sheng an na bing wu » et « an na bing wu », et en cantonais « sing on no bing uk » et « on no bing uk », respectivement.

[44]
Selon l'alinéa 12(1)
d
) de la Loi, une marque de commerce n'est pas enregistrable si elle crée de la confusion avec une marque de commerce déposée. L'article 6 de la Loi énonce les circonstances dans lesquelles une marque de commerce crée de la confusion pour l'application de la Loi. Le paragraphe 6(5) dispose que, en décidant si une marque de commerce crée de la confusion, le tribunal ou le registraire, selon le cas, tient compte de toutes les circonstances de l'espèce, y compris celles qui y sont expressément énumérées, à savoir:
a
) le caractère distinctif inhérent des marques de commerce ou noms commerciaux, et la mesure dans laquelle ils sont devenus connus;
b
) la période pendant laquelle les marques de commerce ou noms commerciaux ont été en usage;
c
) le genre de marchandises, services ou entreprises;
d
) la nature du commerce;
e
) le degré de ressemblance entre les marques de commerce ou les noms commerciaux dans la présentation ou le son, ou dans les idées qu'ils suggèrent.
[45]
Le critère applicable en matière de confusion a été énoncé par la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au par. 20:
Le critère applicable est celui de la première impression que laisse dans l'esprit du consommateur ordinaire plutôt pressé la vue [de la marque], alors qu'il n'a qu'un vague souvenir [des marques de commerce] et qu'il ne s'arrête pas pour réfléchir à la question en profondeur, pas plus que pour examiner de près les ressemblances et les différences entre les marques.
[46]
Tel qu'il est énoncé dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par. 15, il s'agit de déterminer s'il y aurait confusion chez le consommateur moyen, plus précisément:
Lorsqu'il s'agit de dire si deux marques de commerce peuvent être confondues, il faut prendre en considération les personnes qui achèteront vraisemblablement les marchandises, c'est-à-dire les personnes qui forment habituellement le marché, c'est-à-dire les consommateurs.
[47]
Dans la présente affaire, la Cour estime que la Commission pouvait conclure qu'un pourcentage important de clients de la défenderesse était en mesure de lire et de comprendre les caractères chinois. Comme l'a mentionné la Commission, les affidavits de Cheung Jr. et Sr. démontrent que la défenderesse s'adresse à la collectivité chinoise de la région de Vancouver. La défenderesse a affiché bien en vue les caractères chinois de ses marques de commerce pendant des décennies dans la région de Vancouver, y compris sur les affiches apposées à l'extérieur de ses boulangeries et de celles de licencié, ainsi que sur les papiers à en-tête, les enveloppes, les cartes professionnelles, les cartes promotionnelles pour les gâteaux de mariage, en plus d'inscrire leurs noms en caractères chinois dans un annuaire d'entreprises. En outre, l'affidavit de Cheung Jr. démontre que les caractères chinois des marques de commerce de la défenderesse sont affichés bien en vue sur les boîtes pour gâteaux, les sacs en plastique et les caissettes à pâtisseries en papier jetables utilisées pour emballer les produits de la boulangerie. Le fait que la défenderesse utilise les caractères chinois de façon aussi constante et répandue sur son matériel indique qu'elle considère que beaucoup de ses clients sont en mesure de les lire et de les comprendre (voir
Cheung Kong
, précitée, au paragraphe 77).
[48]
En outre, l'affidavit de Cheung Jr. de 2012 fait allusion à un sondage réalisé par la défenderesse en juin et juillet 2010 pour lequel les formulaires distribués à la clientèle étaient disponibles en anglais et en chinois. La défenderesse a reçu 2 259 formulaires remplis, dont 1 905 en chinois et 354 en anglais. Le fait que 84 % des participants au sondage pouvaient lire et comprendre les caractères chinois confirme la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle un pourcentage important des clients de la défenderesse est en mesure de lire et comprendre les caractères chinois.
[49]
La Commission pouvait aussi conclure que les circonstances de l'espèce favorisaient la défenderesse. En premier lieu, il était loisible à la Commission de conclure que l'inclusion des deux premiers caractères chinois dans les marques de commerce de la défenderesse, qui se prononcent « an na » en mandarin et « on no » en cantonais, et dont la traduction est « Anna », conférait à ces marques un caractère distinctif inhérent plus important que les marques de commerce de la demanderesse. En outre, il ressort de la preuve faisant état de ventes annuelles substantielles et de dépenses de publicité modérées, visant principalement la collectivité chinoise, que les marques de commerce de la défenderesse étaient devenues connues dans la région de Vancouver, surtout au sein de la collectivité chinoise.
[50]
En deuxième lieu, la Commission n'a pas commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que le facteur concernant la période pendant laquelle les marques de commerce des parties ont été employées favorisait l'opposante. La demanderesse a fondé sa demande d'enregistrement des marques de commerce sur un emploi projeté au Canada et n'a présenté aucun élément de preuve concernant l'emploi desdites marques au Canada. En revanche, la défenderesse a présenté de nombreux éléments de preuve démontrant qu'elle et son prédécesseur en titre employaient leurs marques de commerce depuis des décennies.
[51]
En troisième lieu, la Commission pouvait conclure que la question du genre de marchandises, de services ou d'entreprises, et celle du type de commerce favorisaient la défenderesse relativement aux marchandises semblables en raison du chevauchement direct des produits alimentaires.
[52]
En dernier lieu, la Commission pouvait conclure que les marques de commerce des parties comportaient une certaine ressemblance dans le son et la présentation. Comme l'a souligné la défenderesse, la preuve soumise à la Commission sur la question de la prononciation des marques de commerce des parties n'a pas été contredite, et la demanderesse n'a présenté aucun nouvel élément de preuve pertinent sur ce point en appel. L'affidavit de Xie indiquait que les caractères chinois dans les marques de commerce de la défenderesse se prononcent « an na bing wu » en mandarin et « on no bing uk » en cantonais. Mme Xie a affirmé que les caractères chinois qui composent les marques de commerce de la demanderesse dans le dossier T-1763-11 se prononcent « sheng an na bing wu » en mandarin et « sing on no bing uk » en cantonais. Puisque la seule différence relativement au son est le mot « sheng » en mandarin et « sing » en cantonais, il était tout à fait raisonnable pour la Commission de conclure que la prononciation des marques de commerce comportait une certaine ressemblance.
[53]
Relativement à la présentation des marques, Mme Xie a démontré sans être contredite que de parler de la différence entre les styles des caractères chinois dans les marques de commerce des parties revenait à comparer la lecture et la compréhension d'un texte en anglais utilisant la police Arial par rapport à un texte utilisant la police Times New Roman. La demanderesse n'a déposé aucun élément de preuve qui permet d'infirmer la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle les marques de commerce en cause comportent une certaine ressemblance dans la présentation.
[54]
Par conséquent, compte tenu des circonstances de l'espèce, il était raisonnable pour la Commission de faire droit aux motifs d'opposition fondés sur l'alinéa 12(1)
d
) de la Loi relativement aux marchandises semblables.
2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a fait droit aux motifs d'opposition fondés sur l'alinéa 16(3)
a
) de la Loi relativement aux marchandises semblables?
Arguments de la demanderesse
[55]
La demanderesse affirme que, compte tenu des nouveaux éléments de preuve présentés en l'espèce, la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que la demanderesse ne s'était pas acquittée du fardeau imposé par l'alinéa 16(3)
a
), puisqu'il n'existe aucune probabilité raisonnable de confusion entre les marques de commerce des parties.
Arguments de la défenderesse
[56]
La défenderesse souligne que la date à retenir pour l'examen du droit d'une partie à l'enregistrement d'une marque de commerce en vertu de l'article 16 de la Loi est la date de production de la demande, en l'occurrence le 13 décembre 2006 pour la demande no 1,329,118 (dossier T-1761-11), et le 12 décembre 2006 pour la demande no 1,329,117 (dossier T-1763-11). Compte tenu du fait que la probabilité de confusion n'a pas changé entre décembre 2006 et le 20 juin 2011, qui est la date de la décision de la Commission et la date à retenir pour l'examen de la question de savoir si une marque de commerce crée de la confusion avec une marque de commerce déposée, la défenderesse soutient que la demanderesse n'a pas le droit d'enregistrer ses marques de commerce.
Analyse
[57]
La Commission n'a pas commis d'erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que la demanderesse ne s'était pas acquittée de son fardeau d'établir qu'il n'existait aucune probabilité de confusion entre ses marques et les marques de commerce de la défenderesse relativement aux marchandises semblables, puisque la défenderesse avait employé ses marques de commerce avant le 13 décembre 2006, et que la demanderesse n'a présenté aucun élément de preuve démontrant que la probabilité de confusion avait changé entre décembre 2006 et le 20 juin 2011.
3. La Commission a-t-elle commis en erreur lorsqu'elle a fait droit aux motifs d'opposition fondés sur l'alinéa 38(2)
d
) de la Loi relativement aux marchandises semblables?
Arguments de la demanderesse
[58]
La demanderesse affirme que, puisque la Commission a commis une erreur en concluant à l'existence d'une probabilité raisonnable de confusion, la Commission a commis une erreur en concluant que les marques de la demanderesse n'étaient pas distinctives relativement aux marchandises semblables.
Arguments de la défenderesse
[59]
La défenderesse affirme que, de la même façon que pour les motifs d'opposition touchant le droit à l'enregistrement, le rejet par la Commission des marques de la demanderesse sur le fondement du caractère distinctif découlait de sa conclusion selon laquelle il existait une probabilité de confusion entre les marques de commerce des parties. Les marques de la demanderesse ne sont pas distinctives en ce qu'elles ne distinguent pas les marchandises et les services de la demanderesse des marchandises et services offerts par la défenderesse, d'où la probabilité de confusion entre les marques de commerce des parties.
Analyse
[60]
Compte tenu de la preuve présentée, la Cour estime que la Commission pouvait conclure que la défenderesse avait démontré que ses marques de commerce étaient devenues suffisamment connues pour annuler le caractère distinctif des marques en litige avant le 27 février 2008, date à laquelle la défenderesse a produit sa déclaration d'opposition et date pertinente. La conclusion de la Commission relativement à ce motif découlait de son analyse de la preuve présentée par la défenderesse au regard de la confusion et il était loisible à la Commission de conclure que la différence entre les dates pertinentes n'était pas importante.
[61]
La Cour a demandé aux parties de tenter de s'entendre sur une somme forfaitaire relativement à la question des dépens. La Cour avait lu les commentaires qu'ils avaient formulés dans une lettre adressée à la Cour le 22 août 2013. La demanderesse propose 20 541,20 $, incluant la TVH, et la défenderesse demande 25 000 $.
[62]
Tel qu'il a été énoncé dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et réaffirmé dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> « ...la Cour devrait en principe accorder pareilles sommes. Cette méthode épargne aux parties du temps et des efforts et leur permet plus facilement de savoir jusqu'à quel point elles sont tenues responsables des dépens ». La Cour accepte ce raisonnement et, dans l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire, accorde au titre des dépens une somme forfaitaire de 22 500 $, incluant la TVH pour les deux appels.
JUGEMENT
[63]
LA COUR STATUE
:
1) Les appels dans les dossiers T-1761-11 et T-1763-11 sont rejetés;
2) La demanderesse doit payer à la défenderesse, au titre des dépens, la somme globale de 22 500 $, incluant la TVH, pour les deux appels.
