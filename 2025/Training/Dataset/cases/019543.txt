[1]
Kane, J.
: The applicant seeks judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [Board], dated March 18, 2014, which allowed the Minister's application pursuant to section 109 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [Act] to vacate a prior decision made in 2005 which had granted the applicant refugee status.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed.
Background
[3]
The applicant is a citizen of Somalia. He arrived in Canada on September 9, 2004, and claimed refugee protection based on his nationality, membership in the Tunni clan and allegations that his land had been taken over by the militia who were seeking to "eliminate" him. The decision granting the applicant refugee protection was based on an expedited interview by a Refugee Protection Officer [RPO] resulting in an expedited report, dated March 4, 2005. The report noted that:
The claimant is a 34-year old Somali man belonging to the Tunni clan. His father was killed while trying to escape Somalia in 1991. The claimant was able to flee but returned to Somalia in 2001 to discover that the family's farm had been taken over by a militia leader. The claimant appealed to the self proclaimed governor of the area for assistance but was denied. The claimant fled Somalia for the second time when he learned that the militiamen occupying his family land wished to eliminate him.
[4]
The report noted that the applicant had an identity witness, who was a friend of his father, and who the applicant met at a mosque in Toronto.
[5]
The report also noted that the applicant was knowledgeable about the Tunni clan. The RPO stated: "I have no reason to doubt the claimant's personal, ethnic, tribal, religious or national identity." Finally, the report stated that the documentary evidence suggests that the Tunni are a vulnerable, minority clan in Somalia, that the claimant would be in danger if he were to return and that this danger is "compounded by the fact that the claimant tried to regain his family land from a militiaman who was occupying it, and that has led to a threat to the claimant's life which is specific to him and additional to the mere fact that he is Tunni."
[6]
In 2005 the Board accepted the applicant's claim noting that he "was found by a perceptive RPO to be believable. His evidence is corroborated by one witness. His tribe is of a minority which lives in some danger."
[7]
Based on new information revealed by finger print analysis, the Minister sought to vacate the applicant's refugee status. The new information included that the applicant had entered the United States [U.S.] in 1996 and resided there until 2004 and, as a result, was not in Somalia at the time of the alleged threat to him and his land; the applicant had several aliases in the U.S.; and, the applicant had an extensive criminal record in the U.S.
The 2014 Decision of the Board
[8]
The Board found that the applicant's positive refugee decision was obtained as the result of his misrepresentation and withholding of material facts relating to a relevant matter and that there was no other sufficient evidence that was considered by the Board in 2005 to justify the applicant's refugee status.
[9]
The Board noted that the applicant admitted the misrepresentations but argued that the misrepresentations were not material and that the evidence of the identity witness was sufficient to justify refugee protection based on his nationality and ethnicity, which are facts not affected by his misrepresentations.
[10]
The Board disagreed and found that the applicant's misrepresentation about his whereabouts between July 1996 and 2004 was indeed material and relevant. The Board noted that the 2005 Board decision did not indicate that the allegation of past persecution in Somalia was not germane and it should have been regarded as relevant to the positive refugee determination.
[11]
The Board found that the claim was accepted in 2005 because the Board had found that the applicant was a credible witness with respect to
all
the facts alleged, including his Tunni ethnicity and his alleged persecution. If the Board had known that the applicant was not even in Somalia in 2001, the Board would have found that the applicant was not credible.
[12]
The Board also found that the testimony of the identity witness only established that the applicant is Somalian, not that he is a member of the Tunni tribe, noting:
[T]here is nothing in the text of the expedited report before me as to what evidence was provided by AH [the identity witness] at the expedited interview to verify that AH provided any testimony at all to the RPD about the respondent's [now the applicant] ethnicity. The expedited report only says that AH testified and that he knew the respondent's father and that AH's testimony was consistent with information provided by the respondent.
[13]
The Board attributed no weight to the applicant's own testimony at the 2014 hearing where he indicated that the identity witness had testified at the expedited hearing in 2005 that the applicant is Tunni.
[14]
The Board found that the applicant was not a credible witness with respect to his ethnicity, noting that he did not claim to be Tunni in his U.S. asylum claim or with U.S. authorities, despite that in his Canadian claim for protection, he alleged his ethnicity to be one of the most important reasons for his fear of returning to Somalia.
The Standard of Review
[15]
The issues in the present case are questions of mixed fact and law. The reasonableness standard applies; the issue is whether the Board's decision "falls within 'a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law' (Dunsmuir, at para 47). There might be more than one reasonable outcome. However, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome" (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[16]
In
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada elaborated on the requirements of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , noting that reasons are to "be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes" and that courts may "look to the record for the purpose of assessing the reasonableness of the outcome".
[17]
It is also well-established that boards and tribunals are ideally placed to assess the credibility of refugee claimants (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 315 (FCA)) and, given its role as trier of fact, the Board's credibility findings should be given significant deference (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ No 1329;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 82).
Relevant statutory provision
Section 109 of the Act provides:
109. (1) The Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.
(2) The Refugee Protection Division may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the first determination to justify refugee protection.
(3) If the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed to be rejected and the decision that led to the conferral of refugee protection is nullified.
109. (1) La Section de la protection des réfugiés peut, sur demande du ministre, annuler la décision ayant accueilli la demande d'asile résultant, directement ou indirectement, de présentations erronées sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou de réticence sur ce fait.
(2) Elle peut rejeter la demande si elle estime qu'il reste suffisamment d'éléments de preuve, parmi ceux pris en compte lors de la décision initiale, pour justifier l'asile.
(3) La décision portant annulation est assimilée au rejet de la demande d'asile, la décision initiale étant dès lors nulle.
The Issues
[18]
This application for judicial review raises two related issues:
• Whether the Board erred in determining that the 2005 decision granting the applicant refugee protection was obtained as a result of a misrepresentation of a material fact relating to a relevant matter?
• Whether the Board erred in determining that there was no other sufficient evidence to justify refugee protection pursuant to ss 109(2) despite the misrepresentation?
The Applicant's position
[19]
The applicant argues that his misrepresentations are not material or relevant because he is a Tunni from Somalia and, on this basis alone, his refugee status would or should have been granted in 2005. The applicant submits that an identity witness confirmed that he is from Somalia and is a Tunni. Therefore, the fact that he was not in Somalia at the time of the events he claimed, i.e., the threat from the militiaman who had taken over his family's farm, is of no consequence.
[20]
The applicant argues that the Board erred in speculating about what the previous Board would have concluded in 2005 if there had been no misrepresentation. The Board in 2014 was required to consider the evidence that was available in 2005 and then determine whether that evidence would have been sufficient to justify refugee protection. The applicant submits that the Board failed to do so and that the evidence in 2005 would have justified refugee protection.
[21]
The applicant claims that it was unreasonable for the Board in 2014 to assume what would have been relevant to the 2005 Board based on the RPO's report and to rely on the fact that in 2005 the Board did
not
indicate that the allegation of persecution was not germane. The applicant submits that documentary evidence should be considered for what it does say, rather than what it does not say (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  168 FTR 283;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  167 FTR 309; and,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1641).
[22]
The applicant argues that even though he spent years in the U.S., including the time period he alleged persecution in Somalia, and had a criminal history in the U.S., this would not necessarily have resulted in inadmissibility to Canada. His claim for refugee protection based on the persecution of Tunni in Somalia would have still been considered, albeit not in an expedited manner.
[23]
The applicant also argues that the Board erred in assessing his credibility based on his past misrepresentations. He admitted that he made misrepresentations in the past, but this should not have tainted his testimony at the 2014 hearing. Moreover, even where an applicant is not credible, the Board must consider the documentary evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] FCJ No 987 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] FCJ No 50).
[24]
The applicant submits that the objective documentary evidence establishes that he is a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97, even if he is not credible. The test for protection pursuant to section 97 is objective, based on the applicant's profile and the documentary evidence before the Board (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 296 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 566 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 1247; and,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 996). The applicant reiterates that he is a Tunni from Somalia and that the country conditions in 2005 would have led to the finding that he was in need of protection.
[25]
The applicant submits that his testimony indicated what the identity witness had said in 2005 and this should have been considered along with the report of the RPO which indicated that the identity witness confirmed he is from Somalia and a Tunni.
The Respondent's Position
[26]
The respondent submits that Board carefully considered the evidence before it, including the report of the RPO in 2005 which indicates that the threat from the militiaman was an integral part of the applicant's claim. The claim was not based solely on his nationality or his ethnicity.
[27]
The applicant's Personal Information Form [PIF], submitted in 2004, which set out his claim and reason for refugee protection, is part of the record and demonstrates that the applicant did not disclose that he was ever in the U.S. The PIF recounts the applicant's claim that he left Somalia in 1991 and later returned to Somalia in 2001, but fled due to the occupation of his family farm and the threats to his life from the militiaman in 2003 and 2004.
[28]
The respondent notes that due to the untruthfulness of this information, it is not known when the applicant actually left Somalia. However, he was clearly not in Somalia at the time of the alleged threat.
[29]
The respondent submits that the Board reasonably found that the applicant misrepresented or withheld material facts relevant at the time his refugee claim was made. The Board made reasonable inferences of fact. The applicant is merely challenging how the Board weighed the evidence.
[30]
The respondent submits that the 2005 decision reveals that the applicant was found by the RPO to be believable. It was reasonable for the Board to infer that the 2005 decision referred to the believability of all of the facts the applicant had claimed, including the allegation of persecution and threats to his life.
[31]
The Board did not speculate, rather it made the appropriate inferences regarding whether the claim for refugee protection would have been successful if there had been no misrepresentations. The respondent points out that what is now known is that the applicant left Somalia at some time before 1996, although it is not known how long before, and lived in the U.S. for at least eight years before arriving in Canada. The applicant was not in Somalia at the time of the alleged persecution that caused him to leave. The respondent submits that being Tunni, even if that were established, and Somalian is not sufficient on its own to justify refugee protection.
[32]
The Board also noted that the identity witness in 2005 did not confirm that the applicant was Tunni. The identity witness only referred to knowing the applicant's father in Somalia. The 2005 report notes only that the applicant was knowledgeable about the Tunni clan.
[33]
In addition, the Board's negative credibility inferences regarding the applicant's ethnicity were reasonably based on the discrepancy between his Canadian refugee claim and his U.S. asylum claim.
[34]
The respondent submits that there must be more than country condition evidence to establish persecution (
Canada (Minister of Public Safety and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  191 FTR 316; and,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ No 1773). In this case, there is no evidence to link the applicant to possible persecution in Somalia in 2005.
[35]
The respondent adds that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> are distinguishable because, in those cases, the identity of the claimant was not in dispute. In the present case, the Board did not accept that the applicant was a member of the Tunni tribe, which was fundamental to his claim for refugee protection.
The Board reasonably found that the 2005 decision granting the applicant refugee protection was obtained as a result of a misrepresentation of a material fact related to a relevant matter
[36]
The approach to an application to vacate a decision granting refugee status involves two steps: first, the Board must find that the decision granting refugee protection was obtained as a result of a direct or indirect misrepresentation, or of withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter; second, the Board should consider whether there remains sufficient evidence that was considered at the time of the positive determination to justify refugee protection and, if so, the Board
may
reject the application to vacate (i.e. confirm the refugee status), notwithstanding the misrepresentation.
[37]
In the present case, the applicant admitted that he misrepresented facts and withheld that he was in the U.S. from 1996-2004. He argues, however, that his misrepresentations are not material or relevant because the basis for his claim for refugee protection is that he is Somalian and of Tunni ethnicity and these facts are unchanged by his misrepresentation and constitute sufficient evidence to justify his refugee protection.
[38]
I do not accept the applicant's submission that his misrepresentations regarding his eight or more years spent in the U.S., his aliases, or his criminal history are not material facts related to a relevant matter and that all that is relevant is that he is a Tunni from Somalia. The applicant's refugee claim was based on allegations that are now known to be untrue. It is not possible to reconstruct any credible history given that the applicant was not in Somalia at the time of the alleged threats to his life regarding the occupation of his land, an allegation that was clearly part of his claim for refugee protection.
[39]
The Board did not merely speculate about what would have been decided in 2005. The Board reviewed the evidence available in 2005 and reasonably found that the applicant had established he was from Somalia, which was corroborated by an identity witness. However, the 2005 report does not state that the same identity witness confirmed that the applicant is a Tunni. Nor does the applicant's own evidence at the 2014 hearing indicate that the identity witness stated he is a Tunni; the applicant's testimony was vague and evasive. Moreover, the applicant did not respond to questions about his current knowledge of the Tunni clan.
[40]
The Board made reasonable inferences about the likely outcome in 2005 if the facts had been known based on the principles of refugee protection. As noted by the respondent, the applicant's nationality and membership in the Tunni clan, if that is true, is insufficient to justify refugee protection.
[41]
Even the RPO report which the Board relied on in 2005 linked the applicant's claim to the specific threat he alleged, noting that the applicant's danger upon return was "compounded by the fact that the claimant tried to regain his family land from a militia man who was occupying it, and that has led to a threat to the claimant's life, which is specific to him and additional to the mere fact that he is Tunni."
[42]
As noted by Justice Harrington in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 18:
Whether considered under subsections 109(1) or 109(2), the member was wrong in concluding that country conditions alone justified the granting of refugee status. The claim must be personalized (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 880,
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 1614 and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above.
[43]
The personal aspect was the applicant's claim that he was persecuted, specifically his allegation of the threats made to him by militiamen who occupied his land. Since he was not even in Somalia at the time of this alleged threat, the personal aspect was completely eroded. This misrepresentation was clearly a material fact related to a relevant matter.
The Board reasonably found that there was no other sufficient evidence to justify refugee protection pursuant to ss 109(2) despite the applicant's misrepresentation
[44]
Subsection 109(2) permits the Board to reject the application to vacate if the Board is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered to justify the earlier refugee determination. The Board has discretion; it is not required to reject the application to vacate even if it is satisfied that there was other evidence to justify refugee protection. However, in the present case, the Board was not satisfied that there was any such evidence.
[45]
The evidence available in 2005 was limited to the report of the RPO and Board's brief endorsement of that report. The applicant's evidence in 2014 regarding his 2005 interview and the testimony of his identity witness was evasive and reasonably found not to be credible.
[46]
The Board acknowledged the applicant's explanation that he did not disclose his Tunni ethnicity in his U.S. asylum application because he did not understand U.S. procedures, but found that explanation to be unreasonable. The Board's finding that the applicant's evidence regarding his ethnicity was not credible was reasonably based on the inconsistencies between his Canadian and U.S. asylum claims.
[47]
In addition, the Board probed the applicant at the 2014 hearing regarding the evidence provided in 2005, which revealed that the applicant was evasive in response to whether the identity witness confirmed he is a Tunni or how the identity witness would know if he were Tunni. The applicant was also evasive about whether he was questioned about his knowledge of the Tunni clan.
[48]
The applicant's argument that he is Somalian and Tunni and that this is sufficient to support his refugee claim because the country condition evidence would have supported the risk he faced, cannot succeed, as noted above ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 18)
.
[49]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 1446, Justice Zinn rejected a similar argument. In that case, an applicant who was Roma asserted that once the Board accepted that he was Roma, the Board was obligated to canvass objective country condition materials despite the negative credibility finding. Justice Zinn noted at para 15:
The applicant's submission must fail in light of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wherein, in answering a certified question, the Court stated:
[W]here the Board makes a general finding that the claimant lacks credibility, that determination is sufficient to dispose of the claim unless there is independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim. The claimant bears the onus of demonstrating there was such evidence.
[50]
The applicant also relied on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> for the proposition that, even where an applicant is not credible, the Board must consider the documentary evidence. However, as Justice O'Keefe noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 14, citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  167 FTR 130:
[W]here the only evidence linking the claimant to the persecution emanates from his or her testimony, rejecting the testimony means there is no longer a link to the persecution. It becomes impossible to establish a link between the person's claim and the documentary evidence.
[51]
In the present case, the Board reasonably found that the applicant lacked credibility with respect to his ethnicity. Given that his allegation of persecution was found to be a misrepresentation, there was no link between his claim and the documentary evidence and there was simply no other credible evidence on the record to support his claim for refugee protection.
[52]
As Justice Harrington noted at the conclusion of his decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 24: "It is simply wrong to think one can gain entry to Canada on the strength of a lie."
JUDGMENT
[53]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed; and
2. No question is proposed for certification.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision, datée du 18 mars 2014, par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada (la Commission) a accueilli la demande du ministre présentée en vertu de l'article 109 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (la Loi) d'annuler une décision antérieure rendue en 2005 dans laquelle le demandeur s'était vu reconnaître le statut de réfugié.
[2]
La demande est rejetée pour les motifs exposés ci-après.
Contexte
[3]
Le demandeur est citoyen de la Somalie. Il est arrivé au Canada le 9 septembre 2004, et il a demandé l'asile du fait de sa nationalité, de son appartenance au clan Tunni, et il a fait valoir que sa terre était passée sous le contrôle de la milice qui cherchait à l' « éliminer ». La décision de lui conférer l'asile reposait sur une entrevue tenue dans le cadre du processus accéléré par un agent de protection des réfugiés (l'APR), à la suite de laquelle un rapport accéléré a été rédigé, en date du 4 mars 2005. Le rapport indiquait ce qui suit:
Le demandeur d'asile est un Somalien de 34 ans appartenant au clan Tunni. Son père a été tué alors qu'il tentait de fuir la Somalie en 1991. Le demandeur d'asile a pu s'enfuir, mais il est retourné en Somalie en 2001 et a découvert que la ferme familiale était passée sous le contrôle d'un chef de la milice. Le demandeur d'asile a demandé de l'aide au gouverneur autoproclamé de la région, ce qui lui a été refusé. Le demandeur d'asile a fui la Somalie pour la seconde fois lorsqu'il a appris que les miliciens qui occupaient les terres de sa famille voulaient l'éliminer.
[4]
Selon le rapport, le demandeur avait appelé à comparaître un témoin pour attester son identité, qui était un ami de son père et qu'il avait rencontré dans une mosquée à Toronto.
[5]
Le rapport indiquait également que le demandeur possédait des connaissances sur le clan Tunni. L'APR a affirmé: « Je n'ai aucune raison de douter de l'identité personnelle, ethnique, tribale, religieuse ou nationale du demandeur d'asile. » Enfin, selon le rapport, la preuve documentaire laisse supposer que le clan Tunni est un clan minoritaire vulnérable en Somalie, que le demandeur serait en danger s'il devait y retourner et que, à ce constat « s'ajoute le fait que le demandeur d'asile a tenté de récupérer les terres de sa famille en en chassant le milicien qui les occupait, ce qui est à l'origine des menaces de mort que le demandeur d'asile a reçues; menaces qui ont été personnellement adressées au demandeur d'asile et qui s'ajoutent au simple fait qu'il appartient au clan Tunni ».
[6]
En 2005, la Commission a accepté la demande du demandeur indiquant qu' « [un] APR perspicace a jugé crédible le demandeur d'asile. La preuve du demandeur d'asile est corroborée par un témoin. Il fait en outre partie d'un clan minoritaire qui est exposé à un certain danger ».
[7]
En se fondant sur les nouveaux renseignements révélés par l'analyse des empreintes digitales, le ministre a demandé l'annulation du statut de réfugié du demandeur. Les nouveaux renseignements indiquaient que le demandeur était entré aux États-Unis (les É.-U.) en 1996 et qu'il y avait résidé jusqu'en 2004 et, par conséquent, qu'il n'était pas en Somalie au moment de la menace proférée contre lui et sa terre; le demandeur était connu sous plusieurs noms aux États-Unis; et, il possédait un lourd casier judiciaire dans ce pays.
La décision de 2014 de la Commission
[8]
La Commission a conclu que la décision favorable rendue à l'égard du demandeur résultait de présentations erronées sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou de réticence sur ce fait, et que les autres éléments de preuve pris en compte par la SPR en 2005 n'étaient pas suffisants pour justifier la décision de lui reconnaître le statut de réfugié.
[9]
La Commission a indiqué que le demandeur a admis avoir fait des présentations erronées mais qu'il a ajouté que celles-ci n'étaient pas importantes et que le témoignage du témoin pouvant attester son identité était suffisant pour justifier de lui accorder l'asile du fait de sa nationalité et de son origine ethnique, qui sont des faits qui ne sont pas altérés par les présentations erronées.
[10]
La Commission était en désaccord et a conclu que les présentations erronées du demandeur à propos des endroits où il se trouvait de juillet 1996 à 2004 se rapportaient bel et bien à un fait important et pertinent. Selon la Commission, la décision du commissaire rendue en 2005 n'indiquait pas que les allégations de persécution antérieure en Somalie n'étaient pas pertinentes et ces allégations auraient dû être vues comme des éléments pertinents pour la prise d'une décision favorable.
[11]
La Commission a conclu que la demande d'asile a été accueillie en 2005 parce que le commissaire avait établi que le demandeur était un témoin crédible en ce qui a trait à
l'ensemble
des faits allégués, y compris sa présumée persécution et son appartenance au clan Tunni. Si la Commission avait su que le demandeur ne se trouvait même pas en Somalie en 2001, elle aurait jugé le demandeur non crédible.
[12]
La Commission a également conclu que le témoignage du témoin pouvant attester l'identité du demandeur pouvait prouver que celui-ci était Somalien mais pas qu'il était membre du clan Tunni, affirmant:
[Il] n'est aucunement fait mention, dans le rapport sur le processus accéléré dont je dispose, des éléments de preuve qu'aurait fourni AH [le témoin pouvant attester l'identité] lors de l'entrevue tenue dans le cadre du processus accéléré pour vérifier qu'AH a bel et bien parlé de l'origine ethnique de l'intimé [le demandeur en l'espèce] dans son témoignage à la SPR. Il est seulement écrit dans le rapport sur le processus accéléré qu'AH a déclaré qu'il connaissait le père de l'intimé et que le témoignage d'AH concordait avec des renseignements fournis par l'intimé.
[13]
La Commission n'a accordé aucun poids au témoignage du demandeur lui-même présenté à l'audience de 2014 où il a affirmé que le témoin pouvant attester son identité avait déclaré lors de l'audience accélérée en 2005 qu'il appartenait au clan Tunni.
[14]
La Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas un témoin crédible en ce qui a trait à son origine ethnique, précisant qu'il n'a pas fait mention de son appartenance au clan Tunni dans sa demande d'asile aux États-Unis ni n'a informé les autorités de l'immigration américaines de ce fait, malgré l'allégation formulée dans sa demande d'asile présentée au Canada selon laquelle son origine ethnique était l'un des principaux fondements de sa crainte à l'égard de la Somalie.
La norme de contrôle
[15]
Les questions en litige dans la présente affaire sont des questions mixtes de fait et de droit. La norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique; la question est de savoir si la décision de la Commission appartient aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 47). Il peut exister plus d'une issue raisonnable. Néanmoins, si le processus et l'issue en cause cadrent bien avec les principes de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité, la cour de révision ne peut y substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable » (
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[16] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a donné des précisions sur les exigences énoncées dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précisant que les motifs doivent être « examinés en corrélation avec le résultat et ils doivent permettre de savoir si ce dernier fait partie des issues possibles » et que les tribunaux peuvent « examiner le dossier pour apprécier le caractère raisonnable du résultat ».
[17]
Il est bien établi que les commissions et les tribunaux administratifs occupent une position idéale pour évaluer la crédibilité des demandeurs d'asile (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 4, 160 NR 315 (CAF)) et, compte tenu de son rôle d'arbitre des faits, il convient de faire preuve de retenue à l'égard des conclusions de la Commission en matière de crédibilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 13, [2008] ACF No 1329;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 65, 415 FTR 82).
La disposition législative pertinente
L'article 109 de la Loi dispose:
109. (1) La Section de la protection des réfugiés peut, sur demande du ministre, annuler la décision ayant accueilli la demande d'asile résultant, directement ou indirectement, de présentations erronées sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou de réticence sur ce fait.
(2) Elle peut rejeter la demande si elle estime qu'il reste suffisamment d'éléments de preuve, parmi ceux pris en compte lors de la décision initiale, pour justifier l'asile.
(3) La décision portant annulation est assimilée au rejet de la demande d'asile, la décision initiale étant dès lors nulle.
109. (1) The Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter
(2) The Refugee Protection Division may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the first determination to justify refugee protection.
(3) If the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed to be rejected and the decision that led to the conferral of refugee protection is nullified.
Les questions en litige
[18]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève deux questions connexes:
• La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que la décision de 2005 accordant l'asile au demandeur découlait de présentations erronées sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent?
• La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant qu'il ne restait pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour justifier l'asile au titre du paragraphe 109(2) malgré les présentations erronées?
La position du demandeur
[19]
Le demandeur prétend que ses présentations erronées ne sont pas importantes ni pertinentes parce qu'il appartient au clan Tunni en Somalie et, pour ce seul motif, son statut de réfugié pouvait ou devait lui être accordé en 2005. Le demandeur soutient qu'un témoin pouvant attester son identité a confirmé qu'il est de la Somalie et appartient au clan Tunni. Par conséquent, le fait qu'il ne se trouvait pas en Somalie au moment des faits allégués, c.-à-d., les menaces du milicien qui occupait la ferme familiale, est sans conséquence.
[20]
Le demandeur allègue que la Commission a commis une erreur en se livrant à une conjecture sur la conclusion que la Commission précédente aurait tirée en 2005 s'il n'y avait pas eu de présentations erronées. En 2014, la Commission était tenue d'examiner les éléments de preuve qui étaient disponibles en 2005 et ensuite de déterminer si ceux-ci étaient suffisants pour justifier d'accorder l'asile. Le demandeur soutient que ce n'est pas ce qu'a fait la Commission et que la preuve disponible en 2005 aurait justifié l'octroi de l'asile.
[21]
Le demandeur fait valoir qu'il était déraisonnable en 2014 que la Commission fasse des suppositions sur ce que la Commission, en 2005, aurait considéré comme pertinent selon le rapport de l'APR et qu'elle s'appuie sur le fait qu'en 2005 la Commission n'a
pas
indiqué que l'allégation de persécution n'était pas pertinente. Le demandeur soutient que la preuve documentaire devrait être prise en compte pour ce qu'elle dit et non pour ce qu'elle ne dit pas (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  168 FTR 283;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  167 FTR 309; et,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF No 1641).
[22]
Le demandeur soutient que, même s'il a passé des années aux États-Unis, y compris la période pendant laquelle la persécution alléguée aurait eu lieu en Somalie, et qu'il possédait un casier judiciaire aux États-Unis, cette situation n'emportait pas nécessairement interdiction de territoire au Canada. Sa demande d'asile fondée sur la persécution subie par le clan Tunni en Somalie aurait quand même été examinée, mais non de manière accélérée.
[23]
Le demandeur soutient également que la Commission a commis une erreur en jugeant de sa crédibilité en fonction de ses présentations erronées antérieures. Il a admis avoir fait des présentations erronées dans le passé, mais cela n'aurait pas dû compromettre le témoignage qu'il a rendu à l'audience en 2014. En outre, même lorsqu'un demandeur n'est pas crédible, la Commission doit tenir compte de la preuve documentaire, (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] ACF No 987 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] ACF No 50).
[24]
Le demandeur soutient que la preuve documentaire objective établit qu'il est une personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97, même s'il n'est pas crédible. L'examen applicable en matière de protection selon l'article 97 est objectif; il repose sur le profil du demandeur et la preuve documentaire dont dispose la Commission (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF No 296 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF No 566 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF No 1247; et,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF No 996). Le demandeur réitère qu'il appartient au clan Tunni de la Somalie et que la situation du pays en 2005 aurait mené à la conclusion qu'il avait qualité de personne à protéger.
[25]
Le demandeur affirme que son témoignage faisait mention de ce que le témoin pouvant attester son identité avait dit en 2005 et que cela aurait dû être pris en compte en même temps que le rapport de l'APR qui indiquait que le témoin en question avait confirmé qu'il est originaire de la Somalie et appartient au clan Tunni.
La position du défendeur
[26]
Le défendeur fait valoir que la Commission a examiné avec soin la preuve dont elle disposait, y compris le rapport de l'APR en 2005 qui indiquait que les menaces du milicien faisaient partie intégrante de la demande d'asile du demandeur, laquelle ne reposait pas seulement sur son origine nationale ou ethnique.
[27]
Le formulaire de renseignements personnels du demandeur (le FRP), déposé en 2004, qui fait état de sa demande d'asile et des motifs à l'appui, fait partie du dossier et démontre que le demandeur n'a jamais révélé qu'il avait déjà été aux États-Unis. Le FRP expose les faits de sa demande d'asile selon lesquels il a quitté la Somalie en 1991 et y est ensuite retourné en 2001, mais qu'il s'est enfui en raison de l'occupation de la ferme familiale et de menaces de mort proférées à son endroit par le milicien en 2003 et 2004.
[28]
Le défendeur souligne qu'en raison de ces renseignements mensongers personne ne sait quand le demandeur a en fait quitté la Somalie. Cependant, il est clair qu'il ne se trouvait pas en Somalie au moment de la menace alléguée.
[29]
Le défendeur est d'avis que la Commission a eu raison de conclure que le demandeur a fait des présentations erronées sur un fait important ou une réticence sur ce fait lorsqu'il a déposé sa demande d'asile. La Commission a tiré une inférence de fait raisonnable. Le demandeur conteste uniquement la façon dont la Commission a soupesé la preuve.
[30]
Le défendeur soutient que la décision de 2005 révèle que le demandeur avait été jugé comme crédible par l'APR. Il était raisonnable que la Commission conclue que la décision de 2005 faisait référence à la vraisemblance de tous les faits allégués par le demandeur, y compris l'allégation de persécution et les menaces de mort.
[31]
La Commission n'a pas fait de supposition, mais a plutôt tiré les conclusions appropriées quant à la question de savoir si la demande d'asile aurait été accueillie en l'absence de présentations erronées. Le défendeur signale que ce qui est désormais connu est que le demandeur a quitté la Somalie à un moment quelconque avant 1996, sans que l'on sache combien de temps avant précisément, et qu'il a vécu aux États-Unis pendant au moins huit ans avant d'arriver au Canada. Le demandeur ne se trouvait pas en Somalie au moment de la persécution alléguée qui l'a amené à fuir. Le défendeur fait valoir qu'appartenir au clan Tunni, même si ce fait était établi, et être Somalien ne suffissent pas en soi pour justifier l'asile.
[32]
La Commission a également souligné que le témoin pouvant attester l'identité du demandeur en 2005 n'avait pas confirmé que celui-ci appartenait au clan Tunni. Le témoin en question a seulement affirmé qu'il connaissait le père du demandeur en Somalie. Le rapport de 2005 indique seulement que le demandeur possédait des connaissances sur le clan Tunni.
[33]
En outre, les conclusions négatives tirées par la Commission au sujet de l'origine ethnique du demandeur reposaient de manière raisonnable sur la divergence entre sa demande d'asile présentée au Canada et celle présentée aux États-Unis.
[34]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il faut plus qu'une preuve de la situation dans le pays pour établir la persécution (
Canada (Ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile) c Gunasingam
, 2008 CF 181, [2008] ACF No 234 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  191 FTR 316; et,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] ACF No 1773). Dans la présente affaire, aucune preuve ne permet d'établir un lien entre le demandeur et la persécution possible en Somalie en 2005.
[35]
Le défendeur ajoute que <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> sont à distinguer parce que, dans ces affaires, l'identité du demandeur n'était pas contestée. En l'espèce, la Commission n'a pas reconnu que le demandeur était un membre du clan Tunni, ce qui était un élément fondamental de sa demande d'asile.
La Commission a eu raison de conclure que la décision de 2005 accordant l'asile au demandeur découlait de présentations erronées sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent
[36]
La façon de traiter une demande visant à faire annuler une décision ayant accordé le statut de réfugié comporte deux étapes: premièrement, la Commission doit conclure que la décision ayant accordé l'asile résultait de présentations erronées directes ou indirectes sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou d'une réticence sur ce fait; deuxièmement, la Commission doit examiner s'il reste suffisamment d'éléments de preuve, parmi ceux pris en compte lors de l'examen favorable à la demande d'asile, pour justifier l'asile et, dans l'affirmative, si la Commission
peut
rejeter la demande d'annulation (c.-à-d. confirmer le statut de réfugié), malgré les présentations erronées.
[37]
Dans la présente affaire, le demandeur a admis avoir fait des présentations erronées sur des faits et n'a pas déclaré qu'il se trouvait aux États-Unis de 1996 à 2004. Cependant, il soutient que ses présentations erronées ne sont pas importantes ni pertinentes puisque le fondement de sa demande d'asile repose sur le fait qu'il est Somalien et d'origine ethnique Tunni et que ces faits demeurent inchangés et constituent des éléments de preuve suffisants pour justifier l'asile.
[38]
Je ne souscris pas à l'argument du demandeur selon lequel ses présentations erronées concernant les huit années passées aux États-Unis, ses pseudonymes ou son casier judiciaire ne sont pas des faits importants quant à un objet pertinent et que tout ce qui est pertinent est qu'il appartient au clan Tunni originaire de la Somalie. La demande d'asile du demandeur était fondée sur des allégations que l'on sait désormais erronées. Il n'est pas possible de reconstituer un récit crédible étant donné que le demandeur ne se trouvait pas en Somalie au moment des menaces de mort alléguées relativement à l'occupation de sa terre, une allégation qui faisait clairement partie de sa demande d'asile.
[39]
La Commission n'a pas fait de supposition sur ce qui aurait pu être décidé en 2005. Elle a examiné la preuve disponible en 2005 et a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur avait établi qu'il était originaire de la Somalie, ce qui avait été corroboré par le témoin pouvant attester son identité. Cependant, le rapport de 2005 ne précise pas si c'est le même témoin qui a confirmé que le demandeur appartenait au clan Tunni. De plus, dans le témoignage du demandeur lui-même, donné à l'audience de 2014, rien n'indique que le témoin pouvant attester son identité ait affirmé qu'il appartient au clan Tunni; le témoignage du demandeur était vague et évasif. En outre, le demandeur n'a pas répondu aux questions au sujet de ses connaissances actuelles sur le clan Tunni.
[40]
La Commission a tiré des conclusions raisonnables quant à la décision qui aurait probablement été rendue en 2005 si les faits avaient été connus, conformément aux principes applicables au droit d'asile. Comme l'a souligné le défendeur, la nationalité du demandeur et son appartenance au clan Tunni, si ces faits sont véridiques, sont insuffisantes pour justifier l'asile.
[41]
Même le rapport de l'APR sur lequel s'est appuyé la Commission en 2005 établissait un lien entre la demande d'asile du demandeur et la menace précise qu'il alléguait, soulignant qu'au danger auquel s'expose le demandeur en cas de retour « s'ajoute le fait que le demandeur d'asile a tenté de récupérer les terres de sa famille en en chassant le milicien qui les occupait, ce qui est à l'origine des menaces de mort que le demandeur d'asile a reçues; menaces qui ont été personnellement adressées au demandeur d'asile et qui s'ajoutent au simple fait qu'il appartient au clan Tunni ».
[42]
Comme l'a fait observer le juge Harrington dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 18:
Tant aux termes du paragraphe 109(1) que du paragraphe 109(2), la commissaire a eu tort de conclure que la situation du pays, à elle seule, justifiait que l'on fasse droit à la demande d'asile du demandeur. La demande doit être personnalisée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 880,
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 1614, et l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité.
[43]
L'aspect personnel de la demande d'asile du demandeur était qu'il avait été persécuté, en particulier l'allégation de menaces de mort proférées contre lui par des miliciens qui occupaient sa terre. Étant donné qu'il ne se trouvait même pas en Somalie au moment de ces menaces alléguées, l'aspect personnel disparaissait complètement. Ces présentations erronées étaient clairement un fait important quant à un objet pertinent.
La Commission a eu raison de conclure qu'il ne restait pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour justifier l'asile au titre du paragraphe 109(2) malgré les présentations erronées
[44]
Le paragraphe 109(2) permet à la Commission de rejeter une demande d'annulation si elle estime qu'il reste suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour justifier la décision initiale relative à l'asile. La Commission a le pouvoir discrétionnaire; elle n'est pas tenue de rejeter la demande d'annulation même si elle estime qu'il reste suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour justifier l'asile. Cependant, en l'espèce, la Commission n'était pas convaincue qu'il restait suffisamment d'éléments de preuve.
[45]
La preuve disponible en 2005 se limitait au rapport de l'APR et à la brève décision de la Commission d'approuver ce rapport. Le témoignage du demandeur en 2014 au sujet de son entrevue de 2005 et le témoignage du témoin pouvant attester son identité étaient évasifs, et il était raisonnable de les juger non crédibles.
[46]
La Commission a accepté l'explication du demandeur selon laquelle il n'avait pas révélé son origine ethnique Tunni dans sa demande d'asile aux États-Unis parce qu'il ne comprenait pas la procédure américaine, mais a jugé cette explication déraisonnable. La conclusion de la Commission voulant que le témoignage du demandeur concernant son origine ethnique n'était pas crédible était raisonnablement fondée sur les contradictions entre sa demande d'asile au Canada et sa demande d'asile aux États-Unis.
[47]
En outre, suivant les questions posées au demandeur par la Commission, à l'audience en 2014, au sujet du témoignage rendu en 2005, celui-ci a répondu de manière évasive à la question de savoir si le témoin pouvant attester son identité avait confirmé son appartenance au clan Tunni ou comment ce témoin aurait pu être en mesure de le savoir. Le demandeur a également répondu de façon évasive à la question de savoir s'il avait été interrogé sur ses connaissances concernant le clan Tunni.
[48]
L'argument du demandeur selon lequel il est Somalien et membre du clan Tunni et que cela est suffisant pour étayer sa demande d'asile puisque la preuve de la situation dans son pays aurait corroboré le risque encouru, ne peut être retenu, comme il a déjà été mentionné ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 18)
.
[49]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] ACF No 1446, le juge Zinn a rejeté un argument similaire. Dans cette affaire, le demandeur qui était d'origine ethnique rome a affirmé qu'une fois que la Commission a accepté son origine ethnique rome, elle a l'obligation de dresser un portrait objectif des conditions de vie dans le pays en cause malgré une conclusion de crédibilité négative. Le juge Zinn a déclaré au paragraphe 15:
La requête du demandeur doit être rejetée à la lumière de la décision de la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans laquelle, en réponse à une question certifiée, la Cour a déclaré:
Lorsque la Commission tire une conclusion générale selon laquelle le demandeur manque de crédibilité, cette conclusion suffit pour rejeter la demande, à moins que le dossier ne comporte une preuve documentaire indépendante et crédible permettant d'étayer une décision favorable au demandeur. C'est au demandeur qu'il incombe de démontrer que cette preuve existe.
[50]
Le demandeur s'est également appuyé sur <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> pour affirmer que, même lorsqu'un demandeur n'est pas crédible, la Commission doit prendre en considération la preuve documentaire. Cependant, comme l'a fait remarquer le juge O'Keefe dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 14, citant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  167 FTR 130:
[L]orsque la seule preuve qui relie le demandeur à la persécution émane de son témoignage, le fait de rejeter ce témoignage signifie que le lien avec la persécution n'existe plus. Il devient donc impossible d'établir un lien entre la revendication de la personne et la preuve documentaire.
[51]
Dans la présente affaire, la Commission a conclu de manière raisonnable que le demandeur manquait de crédibilité quant à son origine ethnique. Étant donné que son allégation de persécution a été considérée comme une présentation erronée, il n'existait aucun lien entre sa revendication et la preuve documentaire, et il n'y avait simplement aucun autre élément de preuve crédible au dossier pour appuyer sa demande d'asile.
[52]
Comme l'a mentionné le juge Harrington à la fin de sa décision dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au paragraphe 24: « Il est tout simplement faux de penser qu'on peut être admis au Canada au moyen d'un mensonge. »
