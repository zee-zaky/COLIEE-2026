MacKay, J.
: This is an application pursuant to s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. The application, dated January 20, 1992, is phrased in terms of s. 18 as it was prior to amendment by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 4, which became effective February 1, 1992. It is made without reference to s. 18.1 of the
Act
as added by the same amending statute, s. 7, providing for judicial review. Yet the relief sought is the same as that included in s. 18(1) of the
Act
as amended and the applicant's motion meets requirements of provisions for judicial review.
[2]
The relief sought includes a writ of certiorari or relief in the nature thereof to quash a decision of the respondent adjudicator, Douglas C. Stanley (the "adjudicator") made January 5, 1992, in which he held that he had jurisdiction to adjudicate upon a complaint filed by the respondent Ronald Pollard ("Pollard") made pursuant to s. 240 of the
Canada Labour Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 as amended (the "
Code
"). The application also seeks a writ of prohibition or relief of the same nature to prohibit the adjudicator from proceeding to adjudicate the complaint of Pollard, and it seeks as well an interlocutory injunction or relief in the nature of a stay of proceedings to prohibit the adjudicator from proceeding to adjudicate the complaint pending a decision of this court.
[3]
At issue in this proceeding is the application of Part III, Division XIV of the
Code
, setting out provisions for dealing with a complaint of unjust dismissal arising from discharge of an employee who at the time was a member of a bargaining unit engaged in a lawful strike during the course of which there was no collective agreement regulating relations between the employer and employees. At the time of the dismissal a previous agreement had expired and the employer had given notice that its terms would not apply during the course of the strike.
The Facts
[4]
The facts are not in dispute. The respondent Pollard was an employee of the applicant ("Canada Post") and a member and officer of a duly certified bargaining unit represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada ("PSAC") when the union commenced a lawful strike on August 24, 1988. In a letter addressed to the union on August 23 Canada Post advised that the collective agreement previously in effect would not govern terms and conditions of employment during the strike which followed the next day. In place of that agreement the employer set out basic terms and conditions that would apply until further advice from Canada Post or until conclusion of a new collective agreement.
[5]
On August 31, 1988, the respondent Pollard's employment with Canada Post was terminated by reason of his alleged misconduct, said to have occurred on August 27 and 29, committed during the course of the strike.
[6]
Canada Post and PSAC concluded a return to work agreement terminating the strike and reinstating the previous collective agreement upon return to work on September 14, and providing that a newly negotiated collective agreement would be effective on September 25, 1988.
[7]
No provision was made in the return to work agreement or in the new collective agreement, neither of which was retroactive, for the respondent Pollard, whose employment had been terminated, to return to work. He did not return to work on September 14 as he was no longer employed by Canada Post on that date.
[8]
On October 4, 1988, Pollard, and his union local on his behalf, filed grievances with Canada Post relating to his discharge from employment, claiming back pay and reinstatement. On the same day Pollard filed a complaint pursuant to s. 240 of the
Canada Labour Code
, a complaint that he had been unjustly dismissed.
[9]
When the grievances were presented to the employer they were rejected by Canada Post, with a notation on the grievance forms, completed by the employer's representative, that the grievances were out of time. When PSAC thereafter asked Canada Post to submit the grievances to arbitration Canada Post declined to do so on the ground that the grievances related to events that took place while there was no collective agreement in effect and it refused to consider the grievance as one under the collective agreement or to give further consideration to the matter. PSAC then filed with the Canada Labour Relations Board an application pursuant to then s. 158 (now s. 65) of the
Code
, requesting the Board to hear and determine whether a collective agreement existed, binding on the employer and the employee, at the relevant times. The Board ruled, on March 14, 1989, and reconfirmed on April 26, that no collective agreement was in place when the incidents allegedly took place and when Pollard was dismissed, but one was in effect when the grievances were filed and determination whether Pollard had rights under the collective agreement was a matter for an arbitrator to decide. That issue was submitted to an arbitrator whose jurisdiction was objected to by Canada Post on the grounds that no collective agreement was in force at the time Pollard's unemployment was terminated and the grievances of Pollard and his union were not subject to arbitration under the back to work agreement. On December 12, 1990, the arbitrator rules that she was without jurisdiction because there was no collective agreement in place at the time of Pollard's discharge and the back to work agreement between the parties, which was not retroactive, while limiting the employer's right to discipline employees returning to work for activities during the strike, made no provision for Pollard's reinstatement to employment and thus did not cover his situation.
[10]
While the first issue raised before the Canada Labour Relations Board was under consideration and before the grievances were submitted to arbitration, the respondent and the new bargaining agent representing the employees, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, filed with the Board, on February 27, 1989, complaints pursuant to s. 97(1)(a), that the employer had contravened ss. 94(1)(a) and 94(3)(a)(i) and 94(3)(a)(vi) of the
Code
relating to unfair practices. These complaints were dismissed by the Board on the ground that they were not initiated within the time limit established by s. 97(2) of the
Code
, having been filed more than 90 days after the circumstances were known which gave rise to the complaint.
[11]
The complaint relating to unjust dismissal filed on October 4, 1988, was then pursued by the respondent Pollard. When it was not settled the respondent Stanley was appointed as an adjudicator by the Minister pursuant to s. 242 of the
Code
. When the matter came on for hearing before the adjudicator in October 1991, Canada Post argued that the adjudicator was without jurisdiction to hear and determine that complaint. In January 1992, the adjudicator ruled that he had jurisdiction to hear the matter. With reference to the arguments raised by Canada Post he held that the exclusion within s. 240(1)(b) was limited to persons who were subject to the terms of a collective agreement at the time of the dismissal and that the exclusion for cases where an alternative procedure for redress is provided, as set out in s. 242(3.1)(b), must be a procedure that provides redress to a complaint that dismissal was unjust and no other process relating to that cause was open to the respondent Pollard under the
Code
or other statute. Thus he was not excluded from the provisions of the
Code
dealing with unjust dismissal. That decision gives rise to this application for judicial review.
Legislation
[12]
The key provisions of the
Code
here in issue are included within Part III of the
Code
, Division XIV which concerns unjust dismissal. They include the following:
"240(1) Subject to subsections (2) and 242(3.1), any person
(a) who has completed twelve consecutive months of continuous employment by an employer, and
(b) who is not a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement,
may make a complaint in writing to an inspector if the employee has been dismissed and considers the dismissal to be unjust.
"(2) Subject to subsection (3), a complaint under subsection (1) shall be made within 90 days from the date on which the person making the complaint was dismissed.
. . . . .
"241(2) On receipt of a complaint made under subsection 240(1), an inspector shall endeavour to assist the parties to the complaint to settle the complaint or cause another inspector to do so.
"(3) Where a complaint is not settled under subsection (2) within such period as the inspector endeavouring to assist the parties pursuant to that subsection considers to be reasonable in the circumstances, the inspector shall, on the written request of the person who made the complaint that the complaint be referred to an adjudicator under subsection 242(1),
(a) report to the Minister that the endeavour to assist the parties to settle the complaint has not succeeded; and
(b) deliver to the Minister the complaint made under subsection 240(1), any written statement giving the reasons for the dismissal provided pursuant to subsection (1) and any other statements or documents the inspector has that relate to the complaint.
"242(1) The Minister may, on receipt of a report pursuant to subsection 241(3), appoint any person that the Minister considers appropriate as an adjudicator to hear and adjudicate on the complaint in respect of which the report was made, and refer the complaint to the adjudicator along with any statement provided pursuant to subsection 241(1).
"(2) An adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subsection (1)
(a) shall consider the complaint within such time as the Governor-in-Council may by regulation prescribe;
(b) shall determine the procedure to be followed, but shall give full opportunity to the parties to the complaint to present evidence and make submissions to the adjudicator and shall consider the information relating to the complaint; and
(c) has, in relation to any complaint before the adjudicator, the powers conferred on the Canada Labour Relations Board, in relation to any proceeding before the Board, under paragraphs 16(a), (b) and (c).
"(3) Subject to subsection (3.1), an adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subsection (1) shall
(a) consider whether the dismissal of the person who made the complaint was unjust and render a decision thereon; and
(b) send a copy of the decision with the reasons therefor to each party to the complaint and to the Minister.
"(3.1) No complaint shall be considered by an adjudicator under subsection (3) in respect of a person where
(a) that person has been laid off because of lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function; or
(b) a procedure for redress has been provided elsewhere in or under this or any other Act of Parliament.
"(4) Where an adjudicator decides pursuant to subsection (3) that a person has been unjustly dismissed, the adjudicator may, by order, require the employer who dismissed the person to
(a) pay the person compensation not exceeding the amount of money that is equivalent to the remuneration that would, but for the dismissal, have been paid by the employer to the person;
(b) reinstate the person in his employ; and
(c) do any other like thing that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal."
Ruling Of The Adjudicator
[13]
When the adjudicator commenced hearings in October 1991, Canada Post raised the preliminary ground that adjudicator Stanley was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the complaint of the respondent Pollard because at the time he made his complaint Pollard was a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement within the jurisdictional exclusion of s. 240(1)(b), and because a procedure for redress was provided elsewhere under the
Code
and thus Pollard's case fell within the jurisdictional exclusion of s. 242(3.1)(b).
[14]
In relation to the first point the adjudicator said, in part (ruling, preliminary issues, Douglas C. Stanley, Adjudicator, dated January 5, 1992 at pp. 16-19):
"The essential issue to the employer's first objection is simply the proper construction of s. 240(1)(b). The employer's proposition that it is the group, not the complainant who has to be 'subject to the terms of a collective agreement' is grammatically a possibility. However, if one reads the section with an understanding of its context and the purpose and intent of the legislation, that grammatical construction simply does not further the intent of the legislation. Indeed, it thwarts the clear intent that persons who are not protected by the arbitration provisions of a collective agreement have an equally efficatious [sic] proceeding to have it determined whether or not their discharge was for just cause.
. . . . .
"Section 57(1) of the
Canada Labour Code
reads as follows:
'57(1) Every collective agreement shall contain a provision for final settlement without stoppage of work, by arbitration or otherwise, of all differences between the parties to or employees bound by the collective agreement, concerning its interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation.'
"Collective Agreements under the
Code
uniformly provide that employees shall only be discharged for just cause and they establish an arbitration procedure. Counsel for the employer suggests that Parliament accepted, when they enacted 240(1)(b), that there may be employees in a bargaining unit who would be covered by neither the arbitration provisions in the collective agreement nor the unjust dismissal provisions of the
Code
. I do not believe that was the intention of Parliament and the more plausible grammatical interpretation of the subsection is that it excludes persons who are subject to the terms of a collective agreement.
"I am not sure why Parliament used the language they did and referred to a person being a 'member of a group'. One possibility is that the drafters recognized that being a member of a bargaining unit did not necessarily mean that you would have the protection of a collective agreement at all times, and they added the qualification of being covered by a collective agreement for greater certainty.
"Other adjudicators have come to this same conclusion, that it is the individual complainant, not the group that the clause refers to. I find that the award of Adjudicator Gagnon  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and Capitaine Courrier Corporation
[1986, unreported] is on point. At p. 6 of Ms. Gagnon's award she states as follows:
'It is the second condition, "not a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement", which poses a problem. I will therefore try to determine whether the complainant, at the time he filed his complaint, was a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement.
'It has been acknowledged that at the time of his dismissal, there was no collective agreement  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Courrier Corporation. In August 1984, however, a collective agreement was reached but it does not cover the complainant, who had by then been dismissed; indeed, the seniority list prepared pursuant to the agreement makes no reference to him. Moreover, the collective agreement stipulates that it has no retroactive effect. Therefore, the complainant has no recourse under the collective agreement: he was not a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement at the time he filed his complaint.'
"I must note that I find Ms. Gagnon's comments ambiguous as to when she believes the critical time is to make the determination. In the case before her it made no difference because the complainant was not covered by the collective agreement at the time of his discharge or at the time he filed his complaint. I conclude that the critical time must be the date of discharge, and only that date.
"I also find that the award of Adjudicator Lamoureux in
Dennis Beaudoin and Cable TV
, April 1, 1984, unreported, is on point. In that case the complainant was discharged during the freeze period between certification and the signing of a first collective agreement. There is no substantial difference between this period and the period of time in our case when the collective agreement expired and a strike was in progress.
"The employer's first argument is therefore rejected."
[15]
As to the second argument raised by Canada Post, Adjudicator Stanley said (at pp. 19-21):
"The second issue is whether alternate means for redress are available. The employer argues that the unfair labour practice sections of the
Canada Labour Code
constitute an avenue of redress. As regards this issue I agree completely with the view expressed by Adjudicator Egan in the
Hill Security Van Lines
award where he says at p. 3:
'The objection based on the argument that "a procedure for redress has been provided elsewhere in this or in any other Act of Parliament" cannot be sustained. The present complaint is concerned with the question of unjust dismissal. The previous complaint dealt with the question of dismissal because of union activity an act which is prohibited under ss. 184 and 186 of the
Code
. In such unfair labour practice cases the specific issue to be decided is whether or not the discharge was associated in the mind of the employer with antiunion bias or discrimination and not the question of whether "just cause" existed.
'Evidence relating to the defence of "just cause" is relevant in cases involving charges of a breach of statutory provisions prohibiting antiunion activities only insofar as such evidence may assist in determining whether "just cause" comprised the sole cause for discharge free from any taint of antiunion bias. The presence or absence of such a bias is the real issue in the unfair labour practice sections and not the presence or absence of just cause. ...
. . . . .
'... Those sections do not embody a procedure from redress for dismissal without just cause in circumstances where breach of their respective provisions is not the issue. The fact that a similar remedy may be awarded in either case does not mean the procedure for redress has been provided elsewhere. ...'
"The basis of a complaint under s. 240(1) of the
Code
is the alleged 'unjust' dismissal of the complainant. The jurisdiction of an adjudicator is set out in s. 242(3)(a) as follows:
'242(3) Decision of adjudicator - Subject to subsection (3.1), an adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subsection (1) shall
(a) consider whether the dismissal of the person who made the complaint was unjust and render a decision thereon;'
"The alternate procedure for redress referred to in s. 242(3.1)(b) must be a procedure that will 'redress' the issue of whether the dismissal was unjust. Counsel for the employer argues that it would be absurd for Parliament to have been referring to the very same procedure as is available under s. 240, because if that procedure already existed s. 240 would not be necessary. In support of that he relies on Adjudicator Marcheterre's comments on the
Hill Security Van Lines and MacDonald
case in
National Bank of Canada and Daneault
, [1989] T.A. 423 (quoted above). I cannot agree with the criticism of Adjudicator Egan's conclusions found in that award. Indeed they seem to completely miss the point that legislation speaks to the future as well as to the conditions existing at the time it was enacted. It is my view that this provision merely contemplates the possibility that there might exist, at some time in the future, special legislation dealing with an industry under Federal jurisdiction, which could provide for the very same kind of adjudication as is generally provided in s. 240. I do not find this remarkable. I would, on the other hand, find it remarkable that if Parliament intended complaints under the
Human Rights Code
, unfair labour practice complaints, and complaints arising out of health and safety legislation (all of which existed at the time s. 240 came into effect) to take precedence to the procedure set out in s. 240 that they would not have so specified.
"The second argument put forward by the employer is rejected. ..."
The Issues
[16]
The application raises for review the two issues dealt with by the adjudicator in his findings that he had jurisdiction to consider the complaint. Essentially, he determined that Pollard was not excluded under s. 240(1)(b) as "a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement" at the relevant time, the date of his dismissal, and that the complaint was not barred pursuant to s. 242(3.1)(b) for there was no "procedure for redress provided elsewhere in or under [the
Code
] or any other Act of Parliament".
[17]
While it was not raised in argument, for the record I note that I follow the decisions of my colleagues, Mr. Justice Cullen (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 295 (F.C.)), in proceeding to deal with this application despite privative clauses in the
Code
which on their face would preclude judicial review. The
Code
, s. 243 provides:
"243(1) Every order of an adjudicator appointed under s. 242(1) is final and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court.
"(2) No order shall be made, process entered or proceeding taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain an adjudicator in any proceedings of the adjudicator under s. 242."
It is well settled that jurisdictional issues, as are those here involved, are open to proceedings for judicial review despite the terms of any privative clause (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), per Stone, J.A., at pp. 585-587;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  jurisdiction of the adjudicator. A preliminary question for the court concerns the appropriate standard for review of those issues. If, on interpretation of the
Code
, Parliament is found to have intended to leave determination of the issue to the adjudicator, then his decision will not be set aside unless it is patently unreasonable, for only then will he be deemed to have exceeded his jurisdiction. If, however, Parliament is deemed to have prescribed a limitation of the adjudicator's jurisdiction then mere error on his part warrants setting his decision aside. (
U.E.S., Local 298 v. Bibeault
, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048; 95 N.R. 161, per Beetz, J., at p. 1086. See, also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 437, per La Forest, J., at pp. 1000-1003.)
"... The difference between these two types of error is clear: only a patently unreasonable error results in an excess of jurisdiction when the question at issue is within the tribunal's jurisdiction, whereas in the case of a legislative provision limiting a tribunal's jurisdiction, a simple error will result in a loss of jurisdiction. It is nevertheless true that the first step in the analysis necessary in the concept of a 'patently unreasonable' error involves determining the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal. At this stage, the court examines not only the wording of the enactment conferring jurisdiction on the administrative tribunal, but the purpose of the statute creating the tribunal, the reason for its existence, the area of expertise of its members and the nature of the problem before the tribunal." (Per Beetz, J., in
U.E.S. Local 298 v. Bibeault
, supra, at p. 1088.)
[19]
Jurisdictional issues concerning an adjudicator's authority to deal with complaints of unjust dismissal under the provisions of the
Code
here relevant have been dealt with by this court or the Court of Appeal on previous occasions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  not apply to or in respect of employees who are managers, was a provision intended by Parliament to limit an adjudicator's jurisdiction to act in relation to complaints of unjust dismissal. Error by the adjudicator in applying the section in determination of whether a person was a manager, resulted in both cases in setting aside the adjudicator's decision. In
Sedpex Inc.
, supra, a decision antedating the Supreme Court decisions in
Bibeault
, supra, and in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Strayer, J., dealing with the interpretation of what is now s. 242(3.1)(a), distinguished between determinations of law relating to jurisdiction, which are considered as more authoritatively determined by courts, and determinations of fact which, given appropriate procedures, are often more appropriately determined by administrative tribunals. In the case of the latter, findings of an adjudicator should be set aside only when demonstrated to be "manifestly wrong". In
Sedpex Inc.
, Strayer, J., found no reviewable error of law, indeed he agreed with the adjudicator's interpretation of now s. 242(3.1)(a), and he found no reviewable error of fact.
[20]
Determination of this preliminary issue, concerning the appropriate standard for review of the adjudicator's findings, and review of those findings, I leave for the moment, to summarize the submissions of the parties. For them the preliminary issue is not of significance for as we shall see, the applicant urges that whatever is the appropriate standard for review the adjudicator's decision fails on both of his findings, while for the respondent Pollard it is submitted that the decision meets the standard on both findings, whatever the appropriate standard may be.
Submissions Of The Parties
[21]
The applicant submits that adjudicator Stanley attributed an incorrect interpretation to two provisions of the
Code
, both of which provisions are said to be of the type which limit jurisdiction so that any erroneous interpretation thereof results in the adjudicator losing jurisdiction. If that is not the appropriate standard, in the alternative the applicant submits that the findings were patently unreasonable and the adjudicator's jurisdiction as determined is in error.
[22]
The first of the errors alleged concerns the interpretation of s. 240(1)(b) which Canada Post contends excluded Pollard because at the time he made his complaint he was a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement as provided in that section. It is urged that Part I of the
Code
provides a complete and cohesive regime for collective bargaining and for a lawful strike in the collective bargaining process. Throughout the period of a lawful strike the trade union remains the exclusive bargaining agent of employees in a bargaining unit and the common law employment relationship does not apply. When Pollard was dismissed he was a member, and an official representative, of the bargaining agent trade union which had exclusive authority to represent him in all matters pertaining to his employment. It is said that the respondent Pollard implicitly acknowledged this, as did his union, by initiating complaints of unfair labour practices under s. 94 of the
Code
and by filing grievances under the collective agreement. The fact that the complaints were dismissed by the Board and that his grievance was ruled not to be arbitrable did not mean that at the date of filing his complaint under s. 240 he was not a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement. If in the result Pollard has no recourse under s. 240 of the
Code
it is said this is entirely in keeping with the purposes of the collective bargaining regime established by Part I. The parties to a collective agreement terminating a strike may provide for the status and recourses of employees discharged or disciplined during the course of a strike or in certain cases, the legislature in providing back to work legislation, as it has done on a number of occasions in relation to strikes affecting Canada Post, will provide for these matters. It is said that before the back to work agreement was concluded in this case there was some discussion about the situation of the respondent Pollard and the evidence of that, as presented to the arbitrator Devlin who dealt with the grievances, is set out in her decision. The applicant urges that since the matter of possible reinstatement of Pollard was discussed in the course of negotiations leading to the back to work agreement and not then specifically provided for it is to be assumed that the matter was dealt with in negotiations. To permit Pollard to now pursue a complaint for unjust dismissal is, in effect, to provide an appeal from the results of collective bargaining, a process inimical to Part I of the
Code
. In my view, the only thing that can be said of the evidence of these discussions is that no provision was made for dealing with his discharge or for his return to work and as the arbitrator found, the back to work agreement was not retroactive, a finding not open to question here.
[23]
The second error said to have been made by the adjudicator was the finding that no procedure for redress was provided elsewhere under the
Code
so that Pollard was not excluded from the application of s. 242 by s. 242(3.1)(b). This was in error, it is urged, because, as Pollard himself implicitly acknowledged by his complaints of unfair labour practices, a process was available under s. 94, with a wide variety of remedial powers, including reinstatement, available to the Board under s. 99. The fact that the Board ruled his complaints were untimely does not alter the fact that he had at his disposal a procedure for redress elsewhere in or under the
Code
. The applicant further urges that Pollard might have sought redress against his union pursuant to s. 37 of the
Code
for failure to properly represent him but I am not persuaded that this argument addresses the issue between the respondent Pollard and his employer. Finally the applicant urged that the words of s. 242(3.1)(b) must be given a meaning that recognizes procedures for redress elsewhere in the
Code
and that the adjudicator's reference to future possibilities is not an appropriate approach to statutory interpretation.
[24]
For the respondent Pollard it was urged that the adjudicator was right in his determination of the interpretation of the two statutory provisions in question, or if the appropriate test for his finding in relation to s. 242(3.1)(b) is that the finding not be patently unreasonable, then his finding on this second issue was not unreasonable. Implicit, in oral argument, was the view that if the appropriate test on the first issue was the same, then his finding that Pollard was not excluded by s. 204(1)(b) was not patently unreasonable.
[25]
In relation to the first issue, the interpretation of s. 240(1)(b), it is urged that the relevant time for determining whether the complainant is "a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement" is the date of his dismissal, not the date of the filing of his complaint which the applicant here urges. That is said to be consistent with the application of s. 240(1)(a) of that section. Moreover, it would avoid what are said to be absurd results that would follow from the applicant's interpretation and it is consistent with the purposes of the
Act
, in particular Part III of the
Code
. In the alternative, it is urged that even if the applicant's interpretation is accepted, at the date of filing of his complaint the respondent Pollard was not "a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement" because he was not at that time an employee.
[26]
On the second issue counsel for the respondent Pollard submits that the other procedures available under the
Code
, referred to by the applicant, do not resolve the complaint for unjust dismissal which was based on alleged misconduct. No other procedures available under the
Code
provide redress for that form of complaint and it is said that the adjudicator was not unreasonable, indeed he was correct, in so finding. Counsel for the respondent did not support the reasoning of this finding by the adjudicator so far as that related to interpretation of the
Act
in light of possible future legislative change, but he did submit that there were other circumstances specifically provided for in the
Code
, which might otherwise be classed within the general scope of unjust dismissal, which provide for redress, for example the provisions of Part II which establish procedures for dealing with allegations that an employer has dismissed an employee who refuses to work for safety reasons.
[27]
This summary of the submissions of the parties does not fully present the able and thorough argument addressed by counsel for each of the parties, nor does it include references to the numerous authorities to which each made reference. Nevertheless, it sets the framework for analysis of the issues raised in this application.
Analysis
[28]
Counsel for each of the parties pointed to inconsistencies adopted by the other throughout the rather tortuous series of proceedings by which the union and the respondent Pollard sought to address his circumstances after his discharge and after return to work by the applicant's employees following the strike. Thus, the applicant points to the grievances filed and the subsequent arbitration, as well as to the complaints of unfair labour practices filed and dismissed by the Board, as actions by or on behalf of the respondent Pollard on the basis that he was included within the collective agreement; and now the respondent's case before the adjudicator depends on his not being a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement. For the respondent it is said that Canada Post in dealing with Pollard's grievances and in all previous proceedings relied on its view that there was no collective agreement applicable to Pollard at the time of his dismissal; and now before the adjudicator it urges that he was a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement at the time of his complaint, even though he had previously been dismissed. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander; it is perhaps too much to expect consistency, and of course neither party is precluded from arguing its best case in each forum in light of the issues there raised. In my view, whatever positions may have been adopted at previous stages, those are not relevant to the issues here raised which are concerned with statutory interpretation.
[29]
I quickly dispose of one of the applicant's arguments based upon implications of the purposes of Part I of the
Code
. It was urged that under Part I of the
Code
a complete and cohesive regime is provided for collective bargaining and for strikes as a lawful part of that process, and once certification is granted a bargaining agent becomes the repository of the rights of all individuals in the bargaining unit in relation to their employer, a situation that continues throughout a lawful strike. Thus, individual rights under contract with an employer, the common law situation, do not arise in the course of a strike (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  then has no right to claim for unjust dismissal if discharged for disciplinary reasons during a strike, the same situation as prevails during the life of a collective agreement. While I agree with the general description of the relations of employee and his or her bargaining agent, I do not agree that it necessarily follows from that, or from the continuing responsibilities of the bargaining agent and the employer during the course of a strike, that the individual employee has no rights in relation to his employer. In any case what is at issue here is not a common law right to redress for unjust dismissal. Whatever that may be is specifically preserved by s. 246 which preserves any civil remedy of an employee against his employer, unaffected by the statutory provisions for dealing with a complaint of unjust dismissal. What is at issue here is a statutory right under s. 240 and the following sections of the
Code
, a matter that depends upon interpretation of the statute.
[30]
I turn first to the preliminary issue of the appropriate standard for review of adjudicator Stanley's findings. Part III of the
Code
has its origin in what was formerly a separate statute, the
Canada Labour (Standards) Code
(originally enacted S.C. 1964-65, c. 38, subsequently included, as amended, as Part III of R.S.C. 1970, c. L-1; now Part III of R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2, as amended). In my view it is intended, as was its predecessor, to set minimum standards for all employment relations subject to federal legislative jurisdiction, with certain specified exceptions, now specified primarily in s. 167. The purposes of the wrongful dismissal provisions of the
Code
, i.e., Division XIV of Part III, were summarized by Strayer, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Inc.
, supra, as follows, at p. 293:
"Section 61.5 (as it then was, now s. 240) was inserted into the
Code
to provide, in effect, a grievance procedure for federally regulated employees not protected by collective bargaining agreements, allowing them to file complaints with respect to unjust dismissal. Where such a complaint is filed and the matter is not otherwise settled the Minister can appoint an adjudicator. If the adjudicator after holding a hearing concludes that the person was unjustly dismissed he can order compensation or reinstatement of that person or some other appropriate remedy. ..."
I would add that the provisions establish a process that may be considered less formal, more expeditious and less costly than a typical action for civil relief in the courts. Moreover, the remedies provided, particularly reinstatement to employment, are beyond the scope of relief available in the courts. By s. 243 orders of adjudicators appointed to consider complaints of unjust dismissal are final and are not subject to question or review, or even judicial review in the normal course, in any court.
[31]
The exceptions of persons or of complaints not subject to determination by an adjudicator concerning alleged unjust dismissal are six. The persons excluded are: managers (s. 167(3)), a person who has not completed 12 consecutive months of continuous employment by an employer (s. 240(1)(a)) subject to s. 189 which provides for continuous employment notwithstanding transfer of responsibilities for federal work or business from one employer to another, and subject also to regulations that may define absences from employment that shall be deemed not to interrupt continuity of employment (s. 246(2) and s. 245), and a person who is a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement (s. 240(1)(b)). Complaints that may not be considered include: those made more than 90 days from the date on which the complainant was dismissed (s. 240(2)), those in respect of a person laid off because of lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function (s. 242(3.1)(a)), and those in respect of a person where a procedure for redress has been provided elsewhere in or under the
Code
or another statute (s. 242(3.1)(b)). The latter three, complaints excluded from consideration, are all incorporated by reference in s. 240(1). All persons employed in employment subject to federal legislative jurisdiction, other than those specifically excluded, have recourse to the procedures for dealing with complaints of unjust dismissal. Over time the scope of the exemptions has been narrowed (see generally my comments in relation to the legislative history of the
Code
in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  22-24) and I conclude that Parliament's intent is to ensure the availability of these remedial procedures to employees generally within its legislative jurisdiction, subject only to the specific exemptions provided.
[32]
The powers of the adjudicator, in procedural and substantive terms are set out in ss. 242(2), (3) and (4), the last of these including authority, where unjust dismissal is found, to order compensation, to reinstate the person in employment and to do any other thing that is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal. Particularly in view of the necessity for understanding appropriate substantive relief in the circumstances, it seems evident that adjudicators appointed to deal with these complaints generally possess specialized knowledge, understanding and experience in relation to labour relations and to unjust dismissal.
[33]
Noting again the decisions of the Court of Appeal in
Lee- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and
Bateman
, supra, holding that the determination under s. 167(3) whether a person is a manager, to whom the provisions concerning unjust dismissal are not available, is a question limiting an adjudicator's jurisdiction, a question on which the last word is that of the courts and not the adjudicator, it is my view that all other exclusions provided by ss. 240(1) and (2) and 242(3.1) are matters for determination by an adjudicator which will only be set aside if there is patently unreasonable error. I reach that conclusion for two reasons, the structure of the
Code
and the procedures set out in ss. 240-245.
[34]
Section 167 of the
Code
provides for the general application of Part III to employees engaged in work subject to federal legislative jurisdiction, with very few exceptions. Among these exceptions s. 167(3) specifically excludes managers from the application of Division XIV, the provisions dealing with unjust dismissal. If all other exemptions were to be considered in the same way they might well have been set out in that subsection. But Parliament did not do that. Rather, the other exceptions are set out in Division XIV itself. All of the others are specified, or incorporated by reference, in s. 242(1). That is the provision, subject to exceptions, for filing a complaint. If that complaint, upon investigation, is not satisfactorily resolved within a reasonable time the inspector to whom the complaint was made, on the request of the complainant, shall report to the Minister that the endeavour to assist the parties has not succeeded (s. 241(3)) and the Minister may then appoint an adjudicator to hear and adjudicate the complaint (s. 242(1)). While the use of the word "may" implies discretion, in my view the Minister has little discretion, except perhaps in the most obvious case of an exemption where there is no dispute about excluding factors; if the purpose of the provisions is to be served the complaint will go forward to an adjudicator for determination. The
Code
provides no grounds for the exercise of discretion by the Minister to refuse to appoint an adjudicator; for example, determination of whether the person complaining or the complaint itself falls within exclusions under Division XIV is not specifically assigned to the Minister. If he were to refuse to act it is my view that decision would be subject to judicial review. While the
Code
does not specifically assign determination of exclusions to the adjudicator, a number of them require determinations of fact which are more suited to decision by the adjudicator with the procedural powers assigned to him than they are to decision by the Minister or his representatives. The process, as earlier noted, is one designed to avoid civil action in the courts. It would ultimately frustrate Parliament's intent, in my view, if virtually every decision of an adjudicator concerning exclusions set out in Division XIV were to be subject to review for "correctness", the test for issues limiting the adjudicator's jurisdiction. Thus, in my view, the standard for review for both questions at issue here is whether the adjudicator's findings interpreting the provisions of the
Code
in relation to the complaint by the respondent were patently unreasonable.
[35]
As to the first issue, the interpretation of s. 240(1)(b), it is my view that the finding of the adjudicator, that Pollard was not excluded by this paragraph, is not patently unreasonable. Indeed, in my view, that finding is correct, in the event the standard for review be perceived otherwise than I have found it. In my view, arbitrator Stanley was correct in interpreting s. 240(1)(b) as relating to the time of the dismissal complained of, not the time of filing the complaint, and that there was no collective agreement in force between the parties at the time Pollard was dismissed, August 31. Thus, though he may then have been a member of a group of employees who comprised a bargaining unit engaged in a lawful strike, at the time of his dismissal there was no collective agreement to which that group of employees were subject.
[36]
The applicant's argument is that the relevant time for assessing the status of the complainant is the date of the complaint and that this is consistent with the scheme of s. 240 as a whole. Yet s. 240(1)(a), requiring a person complaining of unjust dismissal to have completed 12 consecutive months of continuous employment by an employer, is a requirement that must be measured from the date of dismissal if it is to have any sensible application. Moreover, s. 240(2) provides a time limit for filing a complaint, specifically 90 days from the date of the dismissal alleged as unjust.
[37]
It seems to me that s. 240 can only be interpreted on the basis of the relevant time being the date of dismissal. That has been held by an adjudicator to be the relevant time for determination of the status of the complainant as a manager. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  consistent with judicial decisions in
Lee-Shanok
and
Bateman
, where the functions of the complainant at the time of his dismissal were assessed in determining whether he was a "manager" and thus excluded by s. 167(3). It is consistent as well with sensible application of s. 242(3.1)(a), excluding consideration of a complaint from a person laid off because of lack of work or the discontinuance of a function, the relevant time at issue being the date of termination of the complainant as is clearly implied  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Inc.
[38]
Moreover, the interpretation urged by the applicant could lead to anomalous, if not absurd, results that are inconsistent with the purposes of the
Code
. A person within a bargaining unit subject to a collective agreement at the time of his dismissal but not at the time of his complaint would have access to arbitration under the collective agreement and also be free to complain of unjust dismissal under the
Code
. Moreover, the interrelated purposes of Part I of the
Code
, to promote collective bargaining, and Part III of the
Code
, to provide minimum standards in federally regulated employment, if the relevant date for s. 240(1)(b) were the date of the complaint, would permit the employer to unilaterally suspend a collective agreement during a lawful strike and to discharge employees who then would have no recourse to arbitration under a collective agreement, assuming no retroactive application of a subsequent agreement, or no recourse under s. 240.
[39]
There are adjudicators' decisions which deal with this issue though both relate to somewhat different circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  apparently before certification of a union which later negotiated a first collective agreement and in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  certification but before conclusion of a first collective agreement. In both, the adjudicators concerned respectively concluded that s. 240(1)(b) did not preclude consideration of the complaint. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the adjudicator dealt with the argument here raised by Canada Post that at the time the complaint was filed there was a collective agreement binding employees and employer, without determining the relevant time for determination of the complainant's status because the time of filing was the basis of the employer's objection. The adjudicator found that having been discharged before the collective agreement was in effect and the agreement not being retroactive, the complainant was not at the time of his complaint a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement. Counsel for the applicant here distinguishes both cases from this one because both deal with situations where a first collective agreement was negotiated and dismissal occurred during the "freeze periods" between an application for certification and certification in the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and between certification and conclusion of the first collective agreement in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , periods during which the terms and conditions of employment prevailing prior to conclusion of a first agreement are preserved, including implicitly the right to seek redress for unjust dismissal under the
Code
. That situation does not prevail in any interregnum between collective agreements, it is said, because only the certified bargaining agent can then deal with the employer on behalf of employees in a bargaining unit and a strike, even when coupled with suspension of rights under a prior collective agreement, does not revive the common law contractual relationship between employees and employer. As I have noted common law rights of employees are not here in issue.
[40]
The applicant also argued that in seeking the advantage of provisions of the subsequent agreement by initiating grievance proceedings, by filing unfair labour practice complaints under the
Code
, and by his continued association with the bargaining unit and by his representation by his union, Pollard was a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement at the time his complaint of unjust dismissal was filed. But having been dismissed he was not an employee after August 31, and he could not, whatever his actions were thereafter, be a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement, until his employment was restored. Having discharged him the employer can hardly claim that Pollard was thereafter a member of the group of employees subject to the collective agreement, which was not retroactive, negotiated after his dismissal with the bargaining agent acting on behalf of employees continuing in the bargaining unit.
[41]
Thus, I find that the adjudicator's decision on the first issue raised by Canada Post, the application of s. 240(1)(b), was not patently unreasonable. Indeed, in my view the result of that determination was correct.
[42]
When I turn to the adjudicator's ruling on the second issue, the application of s. 242(3.1)(b), in my view his finding, that Pollard was not excluded because his complaint was not one where a procedure for redress has been provided otherwise in or under the
Code
or any other statute, is not patently unreasonable. Indeed, in the circumstances, I believe that finding is consistent with, or correct in light of, the facts and the legislative intent of the paragraph in question.
[43]
I do not share the adjudicator's reasons, related to legislative intent, for that result. The possibility of future legislative change by Parliament is not a prime consideration in the interpretation of legislation which, in accord with s. 10 of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, "shall be considered as always speaking". It is to have meaning in light of the situation prevailing, including existing legislation, at the time of its interpretation and application.
[44]
I agree with the respondent's submissions that alternative processes urged by the applicant as available to Pollard under the
Code
, ss. 37 and 94, do not provide a process to address the issue of unjust dismissal for alleged misconduct, the basis of the respondent's complaint and the matter dealt with in ss. 240 to 245 of the
Code
. Section 37 provides for complaints by a member against his or her union in relation to matters included in a collective agreement. As I have earlier indicated this does not provide a procedure for redress against the employer for alleged unjust dismissal. Nor does s. 94 provide such a procedure. Rather, it concerns complaints concerning unfair labour practices defined by statute, all relating to discriminatory behaviour because of participation in union activities. I share the adjudicator's conclusion that ss. 37 and 94 do not provide a procedure for redress by the employer who is found to have unjustly dismissed an employee.
[45]
Counsel for the respondent points to other circumstances dealt with under the
Code
, not referred to by the adjudicator, where dismissal alleged to be unjust may be redressed, apart from ss. 240 to 245, and thus excluded by s. 242(3.1)(b). Where a collective agreement has expired prior to the right to strike being obtained, an employee who has been discharged without just cause still retains the right to have the discharge arbitrated under the terms of the expired agreement, pursuant to s. 67(4) which provides that the mandatory requirement for a provision in a collective agreement for final settlement of differences without stoppage of work remains in force after expiry of the agreement until lawful strike action. Another circumstance, it is urged, is where an employee is discharged for exercising a right to refuse unsafe work, in which case a process for redress of any complaint is provided under Part II of the
Code
. Counsel points as well to the
Public Service Staff Relations Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35, s. 92(1)(b) and Schedule I, Part II, as an example of other legislation providing for redress, which if applicable would exclude a complaint under s. 242(3.1)(b) of the
Code
.
[46]
These submissions seek to support, aside from ss. 37 and 94, an interpretation of the words "a procedure for redress has been provided elsewhere in or under this or any other Act of Parliament" in s. 242(3.1)(b). In my view it is not essential to finally determine what those words may be deemed to include. Where no other statutory provision is found by an adjudicator to provide a procedure for redress of a complaint of alleged unjust dismissal, the complaint is not excluded from consideration under s. 242(3.1)(b). That, it seems to me, is consistent with the intent of Parliament that the procedures for dealing with complaints of unjust dismissal set out in Division XIV of Part III of the
Code
be available for all employees engaged in employment subject to federal regulation except those specifically excluded. In the assessment of fact and law involved in applying those exclusions, the court should not intervene to affect an adjudicator's finding unless it be patently unreasonable.
[47]
In my view, the decision of the adjudicator is not patently unreasonable in its finding that no other procedure for redress of Pollard's complaint of unjust dismissal exists under the
Code
or other statute.
Conclusion
[48]
At the end of the hearing, as confirmed by advice from counsel shortly thereafter, it was agreed there was no need to give consideration to an order in the nature of a stay of the adjudicator's inquiry ending decision by this court. Thus, I do not deal with that relief originally sought.
[49]
In my view, the adjudicator's findings in relation to both issues, raised as the basis for judicial review and for the orders here sought, were within his jurisdiction, and I am not persuaded that these were patently unreasonable. Thus, the application on behalf of the applicant Canada Post is dismissed with costs.
Application dismissed.
