(With respect to Summary Judgment)
[1]
Kelen, J.
: This is a motion by the defendants for summary judgment seeking determination of the plaintiff's action as the only genuine issue for trial is a question of law.
[2]
This question of law requires the interpretation of ss. 12(1) and 12(3)(a) of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17 (the "
Act
"), which reads as follows:
"12(1) Every person or entity referred to in subsection (3) shall report to an officer, in accordance with the regulations, the importation or exportation of currency or monetary instruments of a value equal to or greater than the prescribed amount.
. . . . .
"(3) Currency or monetary instruments shall be reported under subsection (1)
(a) in the case of currency or monetary instruments in the actual possession of a person arriving in or departing from Canada, or that form part of their baggage if they and their baggage are being carried on board the same conveyance, by that person or, in prescribed circumstances, by the person in charge of the conveyance;"
"12(1) Les personnes ou entités visées au paragraphe (3) sont tenues de déclarer à l'agent, conformément aux règlements, l'importation ou l'exportation des espèces ou effets d'une valeur égale ou supérieure au montant réglementaire.
. . . . .
"(3) Le déclarant est, selon le cas:
a) la personne ayant en sa possession effective ou parmi ses bagages les espèces ou effets se trouvant à bord du moyen de transport par lequel elle est arrivée au Canada ou a quitté le pays ou la personne qui, dans les circonstances réglementaires, est responsable du moyen de transport;"
To be determined in this case is whether the obligation to report the importation of currency with a value equal to or greater than Cdn. $10,000 arises when an individual does not have the subjective intention to import this currency.
Facts
[3]
On March 13, 2004, the plaintiff Van Phat Hoang was driving across Canada. He was lost and took a wrong turn towards the United States border at Pigeon River, Ontario. The plaintiff's vehicle turned around after crossing into United States territory, but before going through the U.S. border checkpoint.
[4]
Upon arriving at the Canadian border checkpoint, the plaintiff was questioned by Canadian Customs Officers. When asked whether he was in possession of money or monetary instruments equal to or greater than Cdn. $10,000, the plaintiff responded in the negative. A subsequent search of the plaintiff's vehicle revealed Cdn. $70,000 in cash, which was packaged in plastic bags and hidden in the tailgate liner of the pick-up truck.
[5]
Failing to report the import of money or monetary instruments equal to or greater than Cdn. $10,000 to Customs Officers is an offence under s. 12 of the
Act
. Pursuant to s. 18 of the
Act
, the cash was seized by the Customs Officers as forfeit.
[6]
The plaintiff applied to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness for the return of the funds under s. 25 of the
Act
. Section 25 reads:
"Request for Minister's decision
"25. A person from whom currency or monetary instruments were seized under section 18, or the lawful owner of the currency or monetary instruments, may within 90 days after the date of the seizure request a decision of the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) was contravened, by giving notice in writing to the officer who seized the currency or monetary instruments or to an officer at the customs office closest to the place where the seizure took place."
"Demande de revision
"25. La personne entre les mains de qui ont été saisis des espèces ou effets en vertu de l'article 18 ou leur propriétaire légitime peut, dans les quatre-vingt-dix jours suivant la saisie, demander au ministre de décider s'il y a eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1) en donnant un avis écrit à l'agent qui les a saisis ou à un agent du bureau de douane le plus proche du lieu de la saisie."
The Minister's Decision under Appeal
[7]
By decision dated October 5, 2004, the Minister informed the plaintiff that the $70,000 would not be returned to him and that the forfeiture was deemed to be justified by the
Act
"[i]n light of the amount of money found, the manner of its transportation and packaging, as well as the lack of documentary evidence establishing its legitimate/legal origin".
[8]
The plaintiff appealed the Minister's decision under s. 30 of the
Act
, which provides for an appeal of the Minister's decision under s. 25 by way of an action in the Federal Court.
Relevant legislation
[9]
The relevant statutes are:
1. the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17; and
2. the
Customs Act
, R.S. 1985, c. 1.
The relevant sections are set out in Appendix "A" [omitted].
[10]
Pursuant to s. 2(1) of the
Cross-border Currency and Monetary Instruments Reporting Regulations
, SOR/2002-412 (the "
Regulations
"), the prescribed amount referred to in s. 12(1) is Cdn. $10,000. See Appendix "A" for this section of the
Regulations
.
The Plaintiff's Argument
[11]
The plaintiff states that he was not aware that he had left Canada, and was not told by Canada Customs officers that he had done so. He argues that he did not intend to cross the border and leave Canada, thus he neither exported nor imported the money in question.
[12]
The plaintiff urges this Court to view s. 12 within the context and purpose of the
Act
, which is to combat international money laundering. It is submitted that the aim of the
Act
is not to detain persons who cross the border accidentally without the intention of leaving Canada. An element of intention is said to be necessary for there to be exportation or importation of goods.
[13]
The plaintiff relies upon the following definitions in
Black's Law Dictionary
, 7th Ed. (St. Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing Co.: 1999), which read:
"import,
n
1.
A product brought into a country from a foreign country where it originated.
importation. The bringing of goods in a country from another country."
The plaintiff submits that he did not import the cash because the cash was not brought into Canada "from a foreign country where it originated". The cash never entered the U.S., and never came to Canada from the U.S.
The Defendants' Argument
[14]
The defendants submit that an individual's intention to cross the border is not relevant. The obligation to report under s. 12 arises whenever a person leaves or enters Canada with currency or monetary instruments in excess of Cdn. $10,000, regardless of their intention. This interpretation of s. 12 is said to be in accord with the ordinary meanings of the words "exportation" and "importation" and with the context and the purpose of the
Act
.
[15]
The defendants rely on the modern approach to statutory interpretation, as set out in
Dreidger on the Construction of Statutes
(2nd Ed. 1983), and endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Rizzo and Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1:
"Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament."
[16]
The ordinary meanings of exportation and importation are as follows, according to
Black's Law Dictionary
: exportation is "the act of sending or carrying goods from one country to another", and importation is "the bringing of goods into a country from another country". The Supreme Court of Canada's construction of the word "import" (in the context of a drug case
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,) was that to import into Canada means to bring a good from anywhere outside Canada to anywhere inside Canada. This necessarily includes the act of crossing the border.
[17]
When interpreting federal statutes, the defendants submit that the Court must bear in mind s. 12 of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, which says that every enactment is to be given large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objectives.
[18]
The purpose of the
Act
is to track suspicious financial transactions and the cross-border movement of large amounts of currency. It does not restrict the amount of money that may be brought into or taken out of Canada or render such a practice illegal. It simply creates a mandatory reporting obligation for the import or export of sums equal to or greater than the designated amount, which currently is Cdn. $10,000.
[19]
If an individual imports or exports currency or monetary instruments in excess of this amount, there is no consequence if the act is reported and the individual is able to account for the funds. If an individual fails to make such a report, a Customs Officer may seize the money as forfeit pursuant to s. 18 of the
Act
. The seized funds may be returned to their owner upon payment of a penalty, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that the money is proceeds of crime, whereupon the funds will be held as forfeit by the Crown.
[20]
In the submission of the defendants, this reporting requirement is mandatory, automatic, and not dependent upon an individual's intention. Including an intention requirement would result in ineffective detection of cross-border movements of money. Parliament does not intend such a consequence; it is unreasonable to interpret a statute in a way which defeats its purpose.
[21]
Further guidance is said to be obtained from the interpretation of the reporting requirement under the
Customs Act
, R.S. 1985, c. 1, under which an importer must account for the quantity and value of goods and pay the associated duties and taxes. Failure to meet this obligation results in a penalty, no matter the source of the error or the intention of the importer. The lack of intent to mislead or the presence of an inadvertent error do not affect the validity of a seizure, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). It is submitted that the reporting obligation under the
Act
is analogous, and the intention of the individual is irrelevant. Failing to report in accordance with the
Act
is said to be a contravention of the
Act
, regardless of whether the individual had the intention to export or import the currency or monetary instrument.
The Test for Granting Summary Judgment
[22]
The issue of summary judgment is governed by Rules 213 to 219 of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106. Of particular import in this case is Rule 216, which provides in part:
"216(1) Where on a motion for summary judgment the Court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or defence, the Court shall grant summary judgment accordingly.
"(2) Where on a motion for summary judgment the Court is satisfied that the only genuine issue is
. . . . .
(b) a question of law, the Court may determine the question and grant summary judgment accordingly.
"(3) Where on a motion for summary judgment the Court decides that there is a genuine issue with respect to a claim or defence, the Court may nevertheless grant summary judgment in favour of any party, either on an issue or generally, if the Court is able on the whole of the evidence to find the facts necessary to decide the questions of fact and law. [...]"
"216(1) Lorsque, par suite d'une requête en jugement sommaire, la Cour est convaincue qu'il n'existe pas de véritable question litigieuse quant à une déclaration ou à une défense, elle rend un jugement sommaire en conséquence. Somme d'argent ou point de droit
"(2) Lorsque, par suite d'une requête en jugement sommaire, la Cour est convaincue que la seule véritable question litigieuse est:
. . . . .
b) un point de droit, elle peut statuer sur celui-ci et rendre un jugement sommaire en conséquence.
"(3) Lorsque, par suite d'une requête en jugement sommaire, la Cour conclut qu'il existe une véritable question litigieuse à l'égard d'une déclaration ou d'une défense, elle peut néanmoins rendre un jugement sommaire en faveur d'une partie, soit sur une question particulière, soit de façon générale, si elle parvient à partir de l'ensemble de la preuve à dégager les faits nécessaires pour trancher les questions de fait et de droit. [...]"
[23]
This Court may grant summary judgment if the only genuine issue for trial is a question of law which is to be decided upon agreed upon evidence. The Federal Court of Appeal has limited the circumstances in which a judge may grant summary judgment, for fear of rendering decisions which are unfair on the evidence, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Because this case has no contested facts and turns solely on a question of law, the caution in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> does not apply.
Analysis
[24]
The facts of this case are not in dispute. The sole issue is a question of law. The plaintiff agrees. Pursuant to sub-rule 216(1) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, I have determined that the only genuine issue for trial is a question of law, i.e. the interpretation of s. 12 of the
Act
.
[25]
The word "importation" is defined neither in the
Act
, nor in the
Regulations
. This means that Parliament intended for the ordinary meaning of this word to apply.
[26]
The meaning of the phrase "the importation ... of currency ..." in s. 12(1) of the
Act
is a question of law to be determined by the Court with the aid of dictionaries.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), per Jackett, C.J., at paragraph 19:
"¶ 19 In legal theory, as I understand the law, the general rule is that a word in a document such as a statute or order in council having the effect of law is to be given its ordinary or popular meaning according to the context [See Note 1 below] and that meaning is a question of law to be determined by the Court with the aid of dictionaries and other legitimate aids of construction. ..."
[27]
The plaintiff submits that the word "importation" means the intended bringing into Canada of the cash from another country. With respect, the Court does not agree. In determining the grammatical and ordinary sense of the word "importation" used by Canadians, the Court has referred to the definition provided in the
Canadian Oxford Dictionary
, 2nd Ed. (Toronto Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2004). The
Canadian Oxford Dictionary
defines the verb "import" as:
"to bring in (especially foreign goods or services) to a country."
(The
Canadian Oxford Dictionary
does not provide a definition for "importation".)
Black's Law Dictionary
defines "importation" as:
"the bringing of goods into a country from another country."
The definitions speak of the concept of bringing goods into a country. This is a physical act. I do not agree with the plaintiff that these meanings require an intention on behalf of the actor.
[28]
The reporting requirement under s. 12 of the
Act
is analogous to the duty to report imported goods under s. 12 of the
Customs Act
. The jurisprudence under s. 12 of the
Customs Act
has held that this
Act
is contravened when an incorrect declaration is made on behalf of the importer even if that error was made with a lack of intent to mislead customs. An inadvertent error in reporting imported goods does not affect the validity of a seizure of those goods.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at page 76.
[29]
A purposive analysis further supports the defendants' position in this matter. The plaintiff states that the purpose of the
Act
is to combat international money laundering. This is not the only purpose. As set out in s. 3, the
Act
requires the reporting of the importation of currency and monetary instruments. To achieve this purpose, the tracking system is obligatory.
[30]
I conclude that s. 12 of the
Act
is not dependent upon an individual's intention to import. The plaintiff has no other defence for his failure to report the currency. Accordingly, I must allow the motion for summary judgment.
Obiter
[31]
The plaintiff has not challenged in this appeal whether the Minister had reasonable grounds to suspect that the seized currency are proceeds of crime. This is also part of the Minister's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 282 F.T.R. 121; 2005 FC 1437, this Court held that that part of the decision under this
Act
must be challenged by way of judicial review under s. 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, and cannot be challenged by way of this action under s. 30 of the
Act
. The Court held that this dichotomy in the appeal procedure is "both awkward and inconvenient", and "unfair", see paragraph 39 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.
[32]
I wish to state in obiter that the appeal to the Federal Court under s. 30(1) of the
Act
is not so clear that I would conclude that Parliament intended two appeals to the Federal Court with respect to the same decision, or that Parliament would have provided a party with the right to appeal the decision by way of an action in the Federal Court, yet limited that appeal to only one part of the decision.
[33]
For example, in the case at bar, the decision of the Minister was under s. 27 of the
Act
, namely that there had been a contravention of s. 12, and under s. 29, namely that the seized currency in the amount of $70,000 is held as forfeit. The appeal right under s. 30 is written in reasonably broad language. It provides that the person who requested a decision of the Minister under s. 25 may appeal "the decision" by way of an action to the Federal Court. While the request for the decision is as to whether s. 12(1) of the
Act
was contravened, the decision which may be appealed is made under ss. 27, 28 and 29 of the
Act
, with the right of an appeal of that decision under s. 30. Applying a modern approach to statutory construction, my interpretation meets the scheme of the
Act
, the object of the
Act
and the intention of Parliament. A narrow interpretation would be, as the Court said in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, "awkward", "inconvenient" and "unfair". I cannot conclude that Parliament would have intended such a result, and I do not think the language of s. 30 is so clear as to dictate such a result.

This motion by the defendants for summary judgment is allowed so that this action is dismissed with costs.
