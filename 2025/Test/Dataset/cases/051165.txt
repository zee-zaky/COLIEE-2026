Collier, J.
: The plaintiff, an American corporation, sues for infringement of two patents. The defendant denies infringement. In the defence, a number of pleas, in respect of validity, are raised. There are, as well, other defences.
[2]
The patents relate to wheelchairs, footrests, and, in particular, to the methods in which footrests may be attached.
[3]
The first patent (805,957), I shall sometimes refer to as the "swingaway patent" or the "latch patent". The application was filed on May 15, 1967. It issued on February 11, 1969. Its priority date is October 31, 1966. Claims 1 to 7 and 10, 11 and 13 are in suit.
[4]
Most wheelchairs have footrests. Some are fixed. Others are detachable. Still others are both swingable and removable.
[5]
The swingaway patent relates to a footrest which can be swung away or detached. The invention asserted is the means of locking the footrest in the operative position. Briefly, that is accomplished by means of a lever and a pin. The pin contacts a cam surface and rides against the cam; this starts a "cocking action"; the movement continues into a locking position on the locking portion of the cam. The footrest is held in that position by the interaction of the pin and the locking surface of the cam.
[6]
The second patent (864,875), I shall sometimes refer to as the "hook-on patent". The application was filed on December 11, 1968. It issued on March 2, 1971. Its priority date is December 14, 1967. Claims 1, 2, 3 and 5 are in suit.
[7]
This patent relates to detachable or removable footrests on wheelchairs; not to those having a swingaway capacity as well. The invention asserted here is a device mechanism for connecting a footrest to a front post of a wheelchair. Two pins project through the front post of the wheelchair. A saddle member carries the footrest. In one embodiment it has two slots. The slots of the saddle member overly, or hook on to, the pins. A latch is provided to co-act with the saddle to prevent vertical motion when the footrest is in the operative position.
[8]
Before going to infringement and validity, I shall deal with the question of the plaintiff's title to the patents in suit. That was in issue at the trial.
[9]
At the trial, certain answers given on examination for discovery were read in by the defendant. The answers were given by David B. Deioma on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff contended the answers given were incorrect; that the information was taken from evidence given in a United States proceeding without further checking. Following the trial of this action, two further affidavits by Deioma were filed. I have assigned Exhibit numbers P-29 and P-30 to the affidavits.
[10]
After considering this further evidence, I find the plaintiff has satisfactorily proved the chain of title from the original grantee, Mobilaid Inc., to the plaintiff.
[11]
I go to the questions of infringement and validity.
[12]
The plaintiff called an independent mechanical engineer, Alan M. Hale, as its expert. He has been with the University of Waterloo, Ontario, since 1965. At the date of trial he was an associate professor in the department of engineering. He has also been active as a consultant.
[13]
The defendant produced Keith S. Rodaway, also a mechanical engineer. Mr. Rodaway had been employed by Everest & Jennings Inc., an American company, from 1971 to 1982. For 9 of those years he was its chief engineer. The defendant, a Canadian company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the United States corporation. The latter has, for many years, manufactured and produced wheelchairs.
[14]
Another witness called on behalf of the defendant was Robert C. Birch, now senior vice-president and a director of the United States corporation. He joined the company in 1947. In 1964 he became marketing manager.
[15]
Both Mr. Hale and Mr. Rodaway gave opinion evidence on the issues of infringement and validity.
[16]
I found Mr. Hale to be a careful, candid, and helpful witness. It was said he did not have experience in the "wheelchair" art, as did Mr. Rodaway and Mr. Birch. I do not accept that criticism of Mr. Hale. The patents here are not concerned with wheelchairs in general. The particular devices or mechanisms are mechanical in nature, and the principles in respect of them are not confined to so-called "wheelchair" art.
[17]
Mr. Rodaway, particularly in cross-examination, frequently showed lack of objectivity. He was sometimes overly technical on minor matters; and sometimes he would not concede points, which I felt he should have. His role seemed to be more of adversary and advocate, rather than that of objective adviser to the court.
[18]
I rely on Mr. Hale's evidence, rather than Mr. Rodaway's, where there is conflict.
[19]
Mr. Birch was not educationally qualified to give expert opinion. His views were based on his experience with the United States Corporation. He has an interest in this suit. He gave the corporate go-ahead for the designs said to infringe the plaintiff's patents.
[20]
I do not give much weight to his evidence dealing with infringement and validity.
Patent 805,957 and Infringement
[21]
I found the evidence of Mr. Hale persuasive. He testified he found all the elements specified in the claims in suit were present in the defendant's Premier line of wheelchairs (see the portion marked as Exhibit P-5). His opinion was not seriously eroded in cross-examination. I accept his evidence, and adopt it as my finding of infringement.
Patent 805,957 and Validity
[22]
The most vigorous defence raised by the defendant is that the alleged invention was anticipated by a prior public use. This was said to be a wheelchair designed by the witness Merle Amundsen in 1964 and 1965. It had what was referred to as an "over centre cam latch" in respect of a swingaway and detachable footrest. It was marketed by Stainless Specialties under the name Vagabond 28. I shall refer to the latch unit or device, for convenience, as the Stainless unit.
[23]
A Stainless wheelchair, with a latching device, was introduced in evidence (Exhibit D-15).
[24]
Certain photographs and brochures were also relied upon.
[25]
The onus of proving anticipation by prior use is on the defendant. In Fox, The Canadian Law of Patents, (4th Ed. 1969), the following appears at p. 476:
...
"Evidence purporting to show that an invention was anticipated by prior use should be subjected to the closest scrutiny ...
...
"Prior use is a question of fact and evidence of prior use must be convincing in order to invalidate a patent."
[26]
I have subjected the evidence, advanced by the defendant, to close scrutiny.
[27]
In my view, prior use resulting in invalidity, has not been proven. There are, as I see it, several reasons for that conclusion.
[28]
Mr. Amundsen's evidence was to the effect the latch device in the Stainless wheelchairs was, for practical purposes, the same as that in the plaintiff's patent. Amundsen's evidence as to his latch mechanism was seriously eroded in cross-examination.
[29]
In 1980, the plaintiff threatened litigation against Everest & Jennings Inc. in the United States. The Canadian patents in suit, and their United States counterparts, were cited. The matter was referred to Ralph Pastoriza, a patent attorney, in California.
[30]
During his investigation, he was in communication with Amundsen. He prepared an affidavit for Amundsen (Exhibit P-10). It was sworn on March 27, 1981. The affidavit refers to the Vagabond-28 wheelchair. Paragraph 6 stated:
"6. The wheelchair pictured in Exhibit B and described in Exhibit C incorporated swing-away cam lock type leg rests with a spring-biased lever having a window slot to lock over a cam edge surface. Attached Exhibit D constitutes a correct schematic sketch of this structure and the same was in public use before October of 1965."
[31]
The sketch referred to as Exhibit D was prepared by Mr. Pastoriza, or by someone under his direction.
[32]
The sketch bears a remarkable resemblance to Figure 2 of the patent in suit: Amundsen admitted there was far less resemblance to the latch mechanism on the Stainless unit (Exhibit D-15).
[33]
Mr. Amundsen said he told Mr. Pastoriza the sketch was not too accurate as to the latch on the Vagabond 28 of fifteen years before. But, he nevertheless gave his oath, in that affidavit, as to the accuracy of the drawing.
[34]
Mr. Pastoriza testified as to the discussion with Amundsen.
[35]
All of this weakens the defendant's contention the latch on the physical Exhibit D-15 is an anticipation of the latching mechanism described in the patent.
[36]
Further, the date on which D-15 came into existence has not been established. The brochure, Exhibit D-28, was not proven to have existed in 1965. The court was asked to infer that D-15 pre-existed the priority date here.
[37]
I am not prepared to draw that inference. There was not, in my opinion, sufficient or satisfactory evidence to warrant doing so.
[38]
Mr. Birch testified he saw a Stainless wheelchair in 1965 at Long Beach, California. He said D-15 was
"... a Stainless Specialties wheelchair having a latch for a swinging footrest substantially identical to that which I examined in the fall of 1965."
[39]
He could not say the latch he saw in 1965, and the latch on D-15 (whenever it came into being), were identical.
[40]
The Stainless unit, to my mind, was not, for purposes of practical utility, equal to the latch described in the patent in suit: I refer, for that test, to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Dickson, J., at pages 534-535: See the detailed test for anticipation set out by Urie, J., of the Federal Court of Appeal, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1, at p. 11 and p. 38.
[41]
Finally, assuming D-15 did pre-exist the relevant date, I am of the view the latching mechanism is not within the plaintiff's patent. The so-called cam is not a cocking cam; the lever pivots around a point: that is not, in fact, a cam. The so-called cocking and locking are performed by different parts.
[42]
Once more, I found Mr. Hale's evidence persuasive on this issue.
[43]
The defence of anticipation fails.
[44]
The defendant has pleaded obviousness, or lack of inventive ingenuity. Obviousness is a question of fact, and the onus of proof is on the attacker of the patent. It was said it would have been very plain to the ordinary skilled workman to have come to the invention asserted in the swingaway patent. The opinions of Rodaway and Birch were relied upon.
[45]
For the reasons given earlier, I do not accept their opinions.
[46]
When the evidence is viewed as a whole, I conclude an ordinary skilled workman at the relevant time here, would not have been led directly, and without difficulty, to the solution found by the patentee.
Patent 864,875 and Infringement
[47]
The alleged infringing device of the defendant was marked as Exhibit P-6.
[48]
Again, I found the evidence of Mr. Hale persuasive.
[49]
He found all the elements specified in claim 1 were present in the defendant's device: I agree with his conclusion and adopt it as my own.
[50]
In respect of claims 2, 3, and 5, he came to the same conclusion. He agreed the lower bearing surfaces on the defendant's saddle member were not, strictly speaking, a slot. It was his view the functions of the defendant's bearing surfaces were identical. The minor structural differences were unimportant.
[51]
There was a great deal of evidence and argument, at trial, as to these structural differences; that the first transverse pin in the claims was not the first transverse pin in the defendant's device.
[52]
I find the defendant, has, however, taken the pith and substance of the invention.
[53]
I do not accept the fine distinctions attempted to be drawn by Mr. Rodaway.
[54]
All the claims in suit have been infringed.
Patent 864,875 and Validity
[55]
As with the other patent, the most vigorous defence raised by the defendant was not non-infringement, but validity. Once more, anticipation and obviousness were raised.
[56]
The anticipation was said to be by the prior use and sale of a locking connection developed by Everest & Jennings Inc. some years before the plaintiff's patent. At trial, the locking connection or device was described as the "old E. & J. hook-on footrest". A device was marked as Exhibit D-12.
[57]
In my view, the claims in suit are not anticipated by the old E. & J. hook-on footrest: The pins do not go through the post; they are behind it. The saddle is a two-piece arrangement instead of a single piece. In respect of claim 5, the old E. & J. device has, as I see it, a different latching action.
[58]
Both Mr. Rodaway and Mr. Birch expressed the view those differences were immaterial; the old E. & J. device was the functional and structural equivalent of the patented apparatus.
[59]
I do not agree.
[60]
I shall not cite again the authorities I referred to in respect of the latch patent. They are equally applicable in this patent. I shall, however, set out the tests approved by the Federal Court of Appeal in the Varta Batteries case at page 11:
...
"However, for these facts to lead to a conclusion that the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent had been anticipated, the prior art must meet the tests conveniently gathered from the relevant jurisprudence by Gibson, J., of the Trial Division of this court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 157, when he said:
'As I understand it, in order that there may be a finding of anticipation, the prior art must (1) give an exact prior description; (2) give directions which will inevitably result in something within the claims; (3) give clear and unmistakable directions; (4) give information which for the purpose of practical utility is equal to that given by the subject patent; (5) convey information so that a person grappling with the same problem must be able to say "that gives me what I wish"; (6) give information to a person of ordinary knowledge so that he must at once perceive the invention; (7) in the absence of explicit directions, teach an "inevitable result" which "can only be proved by experiments"; and (8) satisfy all these tests in a single document without making a mosaic. These tests are enunciated in the following cases:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 189-192;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 444;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 75;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 46-48 and 49.'"
...
[61]
The tests, set out, dealt with prior publications. The same tests, with necessary variances in language, apply in respect of the defence of prior use anticipation.
[62]
The old E. & J. footrest does not, in my view, meet these tests.
[63]
Once again, the defence of obviousness was raised.
[64]
I repeat what I said in the second, third and fourth paragraphs on page 12 of these reasons. [paras. 44, 45 and 46] My comments there, in respect of the other patent, apply here.
[65]
Two other issues remain:
Laches and acquiescence
Limitation of actions provisions
Laches and acquiescence
[66]
The defendant submitted there had been a long delay by the plaintiff in asserting its patent rights; that it would be inequitable now to give relief.
[67]
In late 1968, a sales manager of a predecessor of the plaintiff complained about a footrest put out by Everest & Jennings Inc. ("E. & J.") in the United States. It was said to infringe the plaintiff's hook-on patent, pending in the United States. A threat of future litigation was made in August 1969.
[68]
E. & J. was aware, by July 16, 1973, of the hook-on and swingaway patents which had, by that time, issued in the United States (Exhibit P-25). The patent attorney for E. & J. commented on both patents as to possible attacks in respect of E. & J.'s intention to patent their swingaway footrest.
[69]
E. & J.'s products were, however, on the market prior to the issue of the United States patents.
[70]
Invacare was sold to a group of investors in 1979. Mr. Deioma, earlier referred to, was one of those investors. He was also a patent attorney. He began checking into the plaintiff's patents. On September 17, 1980, he wrote E. & J. threatening suit in respect of the two United States patents and the two Canadian patents.
[71]
It was that letter that gave rise to the Amundsen-Pastoriza dealings, which I earlier recounted.
[72]
The present action was commenced on April 13, 1982.
[73]
A court can, in a proper case,
"... refuse its aid to stale demands, where the plaintiff has slept upon his right and acquiesced for a great length of time. He is then said to be barred by his laches."
(Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Ed.), vol. 16, para. 1476)
[74]
The period of apparent silence, by the plaintiff and its predecessors, does not warrant, in the circumstances here, dismissing the action on the grounds of laches. Mere silence, is not, in my view, a defence to an action for infringement of rights.
[75]
Nor is a long delay in bringing action against an infringer a ground for invoking the bar of laches. I cite Thorson, P., of the Exchequer Court, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  laches and acquiescence. But counsel for the defendant admitted that he could not, in this court, maintain this defence in view of the statement of Fletcher Moulton, L.J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 259, that it is settled law that a patentee need not attempt to stop an infringement when he first learns of it and that his right of action against an infringer is not affected by the circumstance that he did not take action until just before the expiry of the patent. While counsel admitted that he could not urge the defence of laches and acquiescence in this court he did not abandon it. I adopt the statement of Fletcher Moulton, L.J., as applicable in the present case. The plaintiff's delay in bringing action was not laches or acquiescence on its part."
The decision of Thorson, P., was reversed, on other grounds, in the Supreme Court of Canada. The latter court's decision was affirmed by the Privy Council.
[76]
The statement by Thorson P., in my view, correctly sets out the law.
[77]
The defence of laches fails.
[78]
This court, on December 1, 1982, ordered that there be a reference in this case as to damages, or profits, flowing from any infringement. In its statement of claim, the plaintiff seeks damages, or an accounting and payment of profits, "as the plaintiff may elect".
[79]
The defendant submitted the plaintiff should, because of the long delay in bringing action, be limited to a claim for damages only.
[80]
I agree.
[81]
I dealt with this point in the Consolboard case (1978), 39 C.P.R.(2d) 191, at pp. 220-222. That direction was maintained by the Supreme Court of Canada: [1981] 1 S.C.R. 504, at 513.
Limitation of actions
[82]
The plaintiff in its statement of claim alleges the defendant has sold infringing wheelchairs, and wheelchair parts, in Canada. No particular provinces are stated, except in paragraph 9, where the governments of the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec are mentioned.
[83]
There was no evidence, before me, that the defendant's sales were confined to Ontario.
[84]
The defendant has pleaded the limitation statutes of the various provinces to assert the plaintiff is barred from obtaining relief in respect of any infringing acts occurring before April 13, 1980, (2 years before the statement of claim was filed). Alternatively, the date of April 13, 1976, is asserted (6 years before the statement of claim was filed). Quebec is excepted from the alternative position.
[85]
I accept the defendant's contention the applicable limitation period, for all the provinces, excluding Ontario, is 2 years. The defendant had submitted the two-year period applied in Ontario as well. But it has been held the applicable limitation period, in Ontario, is six years: the Varta Batteries case, earlier cited, at pp. 18-22.
[86]
There will be judgment in accordance with these reasons. The plaintiff is entitled to its costs.
[87]
I request counsel for the plaintiff to draw the formal pronouncement, and submit it to counsel for the defendant. If the parties cannot agree, I shall then settle the formal judgment.
Order accordingly.
