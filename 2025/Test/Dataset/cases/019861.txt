Jerome, A.C.J.
: This application by Cangene Corporation for an order extending the time to commence an application for judicial review under s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
came on for hearing before me in Toronto, Ontario, on June 19, 1995. At the conclusion of argument, I took the matter under reserve and indicated that these brief reasons would follow.
Background
[2]
On January 13, 1995, the Commissioner of Patents issued a decision with respect to whether a patent should be granted to the respondent Eli Lilly and Company ("Eli Lilly"). The decision is significant because of the precedent established by the Commissioner's interpretation of s. 39(1) of the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, s. 60(1), as am. Although it was not bound to do so, Eli Lilly voluntarily made the decision public. Cangene Corporation is of the opinion that the interpretation of the legislation adopted by the Commissioner is incorrect. After expressing its concerns to the Commissioner and the Minister, it was assured the matter would be referred to this court for review. As it is now apparent that this course of action is not going to be followed, the applicant wishes to commence its own judicial review application and seeks an extension of time in order to do so.
[3]
I am not prepared to grant the application. The provisions of the
Patent Act
clearly demonstrate that Parliament has provided a comprehensive scheme for challenging the decisions of the Commissioner of Patents. The procedure set out in the
Act
and the
Rules
does not contemplate the type of judicial review proceedings which the applicant in the present case seeks to commence.
[4]
Section 42 of the
Patent Act
provides a right of appeal to this court from decisions of the Commissioner. That section states as follows:
"42. Every person who has failed to obtain a patent by reason of a refusal or objection of the Commissioner to grant it may, at any time within six months, after notice as provided for in section 40 or 41 has been mailed, appeal from the decision of the Commissioner to the Federal Court and that Court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal."
[5]
The right of appeal is given only to those persons who have failed to obtain a patent by reason of a refusal or a rejection from the Commissioner, in the present case, the respondent Eli Lilly. A third party such as Cangene does not have any such right.
[6]
Indeed, the respondent's application for a patent and the proceedings relating thereto, are secret, confidential and not open to the public. A decision of the Commissioner of Patents with respect to such an application is not available to any other party unless the applicant for the patent has expressly given its approval for publication of the decision. Under normal circumstances therefore, Cangene would be unaware of the Commissioner's disposition of the matter. The voluntary publication of the decision by Eli Lilly cannot be taken as a waiver of its own statutory rights, much less the basis for the creation of special status sought by this applicant.
[7]
Third parties are not, however, without a remedy under the
Act
. Section 60(1) provides as follows:
"60(1) A patent or any claim in a patent may be declared invalid or void by the Federal Court of Canada at the instance of the Attorney General of Canada or at the instance of any interested person."
[8]
Finally, where there is a statutory right of appeal such as that provided for in the
Patent Act
, s. 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
precludes judicial review:
"Notwithstanding sections 18 and 18.1, where provision is expressly made by an Act of Parliament for an appeal as such to the Court, to the Supreme Court of Canada, to the Court Martial Appeal Court, to the Tax Court of Canada, to the Governor-in-Council or to the Treasury Board from a decision or order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal made by way or in the course of proceedings before that board, commission or tribunal, that decision or order is not, to the extent that it may be so appealed, subject to review or to be restrained, prohibited, removed or set aside or otherwise dealt with, except in accordance with that Act."
[9]
I am satisfied therefore, based on the statutory scheme set out in the
Patent Act
, that judicial review of the Commissioner's decision is simply not available to the applicant.
[10]
For these reasons the application is dismissed. No order as to costs.
Application dismissed.
