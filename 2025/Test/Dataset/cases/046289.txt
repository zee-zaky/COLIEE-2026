I. INTRODUCTION
[1]
Scott, J.
[Translation]: The applicant is seeking judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board), dated December 21, 2010, under paragraph 72(2)(d) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, R.S.C., 2001, c 27 (the Act). In that decision, the Board dismissed the applicant's claim for refugee protection and determined that he was neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
[2]
For the following reasons, the Court finds that its intervention is not warranted.
II. THE FACTS
[3]
The applicant is a citizen of Haiti. His spouse still lives there, along with their children.
[4]
At the time of the events that give rise to his refugee claim, the applicant was working as a taxi driver. He was also a member of the Association des chauffeurs guides d'Haïti (the Association).
[5]
On March 30, 2005, unknown armed men attempted to kidnap the applicant, his spouse and his daughter when they were getting into their car. They fled and escaped their assailants.
[6]
On January 8, 2009, the applicant received telephone threats demanding that he resign from the Association. One of his colleagues received the same threats.
[7]
On February 1, 2009, that colleague was killed.
[8]
The applicant fled on February 6, 2009. He showed up at the Canadian border on February 7, 2009, and claimed refugee protection.
III. THE BOARD'S DECISION
[9]
In its decision, the Board determined that the applicant had not established a fear of persecution within the meaning of one of the five grounds set out in the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. It also determined that the risk he faced in Haiti was not a personalized risk.
[10]
The applicant maintains that he is a member of a "particular social group" as defined in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Ward
]. The Board dismissed this claim because the risk he faced arose out of his membership in the Association. According to the Board, the Association was neither "[a group] whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association" nor a group "associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence". Furthermore, the Board noted from the applicant's testimony that he planned on changing vocations if he were to return to Haiti.
[11]
The applicant also claims to fear being persecuted for his political opinion. He states that the arms used by the bandits who tried to kidnap him in 2005 came from the government. The Board also dismissed this ground because that allegation does not constitute a political opinion.
[12]
The Board then examined the protection of the Haitian state within the meaning of section 97 of the Act. It found that the applicant faced, in Haiti, a generalized risk within the meaning of paragraph 97(1)(b). The Board relied on the decision of Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 151 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
IV. APPLICABLE LAW
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, R.S.C. 2001, c 27:
Convention refugee
96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
V. ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW
[13]
The following issues arise from this matter:
a. Is the applicant a member of a "particular social group" as defined in Ward?
b. Is the risk faced by the applicant in Haiti a personalized risk?
[14]
The Board's decision with regard to the applicant's fear of persecution on one of the Convention grounds is reviewable on a reasonableness standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  94 A.C.W.S. (3d) 970 (QL) at para. 16). The same standard applies to the second issue (Is the risk face by the applicant in Haiti personalized?) (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 1021 (QL) at para. 19).
[15]
The Court examines the justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process, "[b]ut it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 47).
VI. ANALYSIS
a) Is the applicant a member of a "particular social group" as defined in Ward?
The applicant's position
[16]
The applicant argues that the Board erred by determining that the Association did not meet the definition of a particular social group within the meaning of
Ward
. The applicant noted that he had been an active member of the Association since 2000. His employment as a taxi driver and his membership in the Association enabled him to earn a dignified living and provide for his needs and the needs of his family in Haiti.
[17]
The applicant claims that the Association is a particular social group because its members voluntarily choose to become taxi drivers. The Association's goals were not limited to the monetary or commercial success of the business, but sought to promote the human dignity of all of its members. Having a job allowed members of the Association to provide for themselves and earn a decent living. The applicant further argues that every human being should be able to freely choose their employment. He should not be forced to change professions because of threats.
The respondent's position
[18]
The respondent argues that determining whether someone is a Convention refugee is done by weighing the nature of the threats against an individual and not according to the grounds perceived by the refugee claimant. The respondent relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para. 13. According to the respondent, the applicant acknowledged at the hearing that the intent of the threats was to extort money from him. Extortion is a criminal offence that has no nexus with any of the Convention grounds.
[19]
The respondent cited the three categories of groups of persons set out by the Supreme Court in
Ward
: those that are defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic, those whose members associate for reasons fundamental to their human dignity and those associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence. The respondent argues that the Association is not based on an innate or unchangeable characteristic, and that it is not fundamental to its members' human dignity. The respondent further argues that the applicant intends to change vocations if he returns to Haiti. The respondent also cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 720 at para. 3, in which it is stated that privileged or wealthy individuals do not meet the definition of members of a particular social group based solely on their financial status.
Analysis
[20]
In order for his application for judicial review to succeed, the applicant must convince the Court that the Board erred in its finding that the Association is not a particular social group within the meaning of
Ward
. The vocation of taxi driver does not constitute an innate characteristic or one that is fundamental to human dignity. Furthermore, the applicant acknowledges that he would change professions if he has to return to Haiti. This acknowledgement confirms the voluntary nature of his choice of employment as a taxi driver. His membership in the Association has no impact on his human dignity. Therefore, the Association cannot be considered as a "particular social group" within the meaning of Ward, despite the difficult living conditions in Haiti and the chronic unemployment that continues to plague that country.
b) Is the risk faced by the applicant in Haiti a personalized risk?
The applicant's position
[21]
The applicant maintains that his fear arises from his job as a taxi driver and not only because he is thought to have money. The applicant states that the murder of his colleague convinced him to flee without his spouse and children. Furthermore, he maintains that he filed documentary evidence and provided testimony establishing that the murder and the threats against him resulted from his employment as a taxi driver.
The respondent's position
[22]
The respondent claims that it was reasonably open to the Board to find that the risk to which the applicant would be exposed if he were to return to Haiti is a generalized and not a personalized risk. The respondent cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] F.C.J. No. 222 (QL), in which there is a reference to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 1021 (QL) at para. 22. In that decision, it is stated that "an increased risk experienced by a subcategory of the population is not personalized where that same risk is experienced by the whole population generally, albeit at a reduced frequency". According to the respondent, the Board's findings are reasonable and the applicant simply proved that he is part of a class of Haitian society that is relatively wealthy and therefore more likely to receive threats of extortion.
Analysis
[23]
The Court is of the view that the Board's decision contains no error in its assessment of the facts, or any error in law applicable in this case. In fact, the evidence in the record leads us to find that the Board correctly applied the principles set out in
Ward
, above. The applicant's membership in the Association and his status as a taxi driver-guide do not make him a person in need of protection within the meaning of the Convention because he is not exposed to a different and personalized risk (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, and
Étienne v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2007 FC 64, 154 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1171 (QL)).
VII. CONCLUSION
[24]
The present application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[25]
THE COURT ORDERS that
1. The Court dismiss the application for judicial review.
2. This matter raises no question of general importance.
Application dismissed.
