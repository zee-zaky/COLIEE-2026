Gibson, J.
: These reasons arise out of an application for a stay of the execution of a Deportation Order issued against the applicant at Edmonton, Alberta on March 30, 1994, pending the determination of an application for leave and for judicial review of a decision of the respondent, pursuant to s. 70(5) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended, (the "
Act
"), that the respondent is of the opinion that the applicant "... constitutes a danger to the public in Canada ...".
[2]
The applicant arrived in Canada from England, in the company of his parents and brother and sister, in 1978. He has been a permanent resident of Canada since that time. He has accumulated an impressive criminal record commencing in February 1983, which would have been shortly after he became eligible for trial in adult criminal courts, and continuing until February, 1993. His convictions include six for indecent acts, one for indecent exposure, one for sexual touching, one for invitation to sexual touching, two for assault and one for attempt to obstruct justice. The longest period of incarceration imposed on him as a sentence would appear to be one year which was imposed on two separate occasions.
[3]
As indicated earlier, as a result of the criminal convictions, a deportation order was issued against the applicant on March 30, 1994. An appeal of the Deportation Order was filed with the Immigration Appeal Division on the same day. In the result, execution of the deportation order was stayed by operation of s. 49(1) of the
Act
. The appeal was set down for hearing on November 9, 1995. On November 8, 1995, the applicant was served with the respondent's opinion, which is the subject of the application for leave and for judicial review, that opinion apparently having been reduced to writing by the respondent's delegate at Ottawa on November 6, 1995.
[4]
When the hearing before the Immigration Appeal Division opened on November 9, 1995, counsel for the respondent herein took the position that the Immigration Appeal Division no longer had jurisdiction in the light of the respondent's opinion. Counsel for the applicant opposed that position. The Immigration Appeal Division invited written submissions on the issue which were filed on behalf of the applicant on December 4, 1995. No decision has issued from the Immigration Appeal Division on the question of jurisdiction or on the appeal itself. A question therefor remains as to whether the stay of execution by virtue of s. 49(1) of the
Act
remains in place. That question is not directly before the court on this application.
[5]
On February 21, 1996, the applicant was arrested pending removal from Canada. He was released from custody the next day by an Adjudicator who specifically found that the applicant was not likely to pose a danger to the public and was likely to appear for removal. It is of note that the Adjudicator's finding was in part directly contradictory of the respondent's opinion, at least on its face. Apparently the Adjudicator's conclusion that the applicant was not likely to pose a danger to the public was formed on the basis of material that was before the respondent's delegate at the time the delegate formed an opposite opinion.
[6]
The substance of the material on behalf of the applicant that was before the Adjudicator can be briefly summarized as follows. Since his latest conviction, the applicant has voluntarily entered and successfully completed the Phoenix Program for sex offenders administered by the Alberta Hospital in Edmonton. He has successfully completed a two year period of probation although there may be some doubt about the totality of his conduct since there is an outstanding charge against the applicant for an indecent act in a public place which is not scheduled for trial until June 7, 1996. The applicant has a letter from Dr. L. H. Studer of the Alberta Hospital which contains the following comments:
"We have been very pleased with his [the applicant's] continued motivation to attend treatment, his continued honesty throughout that program [the Phoenix Program], and his willingness to explore the issues necessary.
"As far as we are aware there have been no further episodes of deviant behavior. The patient has done well and
he plans to continue to attend the follow-up group for some time to come.
"In other areas of his life he has married and has secured employment and all indices are positive. As far as we can tell he has shown stability in all aspects of his life over the past two years." (Underlining added by me for emphasis)
He has supportive letters from a social worker and two probation officers. He has a report from the Alberta Hospital, Department of Psychological Services, which concludes in the followings terms:
"Frank has taken some pride in his contribution to the success of this relationship [his marriage] and the skills and insights acquired here. This authentic self-esteem, greater capacity for empathy, and strong desire to succeed vocationally suggest motivation to continue therapy and to utilize these new skills and attitude to act on early warning signs of deviant sexual behavior when they occur."
He has a consent order regarding access to his son by a previous relationship and expresses a strong bond to his son. He provides child support to his son's mother. He has established his own automobile repair and sales business employing three people. He has enrolled in a business administration program. He performed over three hundred hours of volunteer work for a charitable organization between January, 1994 and early September, 1995. He has secured a number of character references.
[7]
At the opening of the teleconference hearing of this application for a stay, counsel were in agreement that, in order for the applicant to succeed, the burden was on him to demonstrate: that there is a serious issue to be tried on his application for leave and for judicial review; that, unless the stay is granted, the applicant will suffer irreparable harm; and that the balance of convenience favours the applicant. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 123 (F.C.A.))
[8]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.)), in reasons arising out of an application for a stay of execution of a removal order made against the applicant therein, Mr. Justice Nadon wrote:
"In my view, there is a serious issue to be tried and that is whether the applicant, in the circumstances of this case, was afforded a real opportunity to put forward his submissions as to why he should not be considered to be a danger to the public in Canada and as to the risks that he might face should he be removed to Iran.
"Put another way, I believe that there is a serious issue in regard to the 'audi alteram partem' rule. I am not suggesting that I agree with counsel that his client was in fact deprived of a real opportunity to put forward his case. However, I accept that, in the circumstances, there certainly is an argument to be made."
The removal proposed here is to England rather than to Iran and thus it is entirely possible here that the risks would be less. But in all other respects, I adopt the view of Mr. Justice Nadon as my own on the facts before me.
[9]
Once again on the facts before me, I am satisfied that the issues of irreparable harm and balance of convenience are closely intertwined.
[10]
Since the applicant's last conviction, he has obviously seriously confronted difficulties that are considered by professionals to be at the root of the most serious of his criminal activities. He has developed support within the community and demonstrates a commitment to take advantage of professional and community resources available to him to bolster his new insights. He has married. He has gained significant and regular access on a consent basis to his son by a previous relationship. He provides some financial support for that son. He has established a business on which three others in the community are dependent for employment. He has essentially no connection to England. He has no established professional or community support there. His wife apparently has no connection to England. His relationship with his son would be severed if he were deported to England. There was no indication in the evidence before me of what would happen to his business if he were deported but I am prepared to assume that he would inevitably lose it.
[11]
A number of cases have held that loss of family support or potential family break-up is not of itself irreparable harm. But I am satisfied that loss of family support as well as the support of other elements of the professional and community support network now available to this applicant, of which he is so obviously in need and on which he has now demonstrated a willingness to rely, would, taken together, constitute irreparable harm to the applicant and, perhaps irrelevantly on an application such as this but I would hope not, for the community into which he would be parachuted.
[12]
There are substantial elements of convenience or inconvenience in the applicant's favour that are directly related to the harm that he would suffer if he were now required to leave Canada.
[13]
On the other side of the balance of convenience or inconvenience element of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test, it is to be noted that the Deportation Order outstanding in relation to the applicant was issued on March 30, 1994 on the basis of an adult criminal record commencing in 1983. Execution of the Order was effectively stayed until s. 70(5) of the
Act
came into effect in July, 1995 and the respondent considered its applicability to the applicant, and arguably remains stayed. Since that time, there is no evidence to indicate that the applicant was in any sense evading implementation of the Order. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary. On the eve of the hearing of the applicant's appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against the Deportation Order, the respondent turned to s. 70(5) of the
Act
. It then took the respondent from mid-November, 1995 to mid-February, 1996 to seek to execute the Order. One can only conclude that the applicant did not rank high on the respondent's list of individuals constituting a danger to the public in Canada.
[14]
While it is beyond doubt that there is a public interest in the respondent fulfilling her responsibilities under the
Immigration Act
, and that that public interest is an element in the balance of convenience in favour of the respondent, I find that element to be substantially reduced in weight by the manner and timing of the respondent's actions to fulfil her obligations.
[15]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 231, Mr. Justice Muldoon stated:
"On the other hand, it would be cold comfort indeed to the applicant or any of his fellows to be removed and then to learn that the law under which he was processed had been declared to be invalid or the proceedings found to be unfair or unlawful. It may be observed that recent radical amendments to the immigration statutes, not yet consolidated nor yet fully tested as to constitutionality, legality of procedures or the fairness of their enforcement, ... mean that the federal law, whose better administration is committed to this court, is in what is at least perceived to be a state of imprecision and flux."
While I would not go so far as to characterize the new s. 70(5) of the
Act
and related provisions as "radical amendments", I am nonetheless satisfied that Mr. Justice Muldoon's comments apply on the facts before me.
[16]
In the result, I conclude that implementation at this time of the Deportation Order outstanding against the applicant would result in irreparable harm to the applicant and that the balance of convenience is in favour of the applicant and weighs against implementation of the Deportation Order at this time.
[17]
Accordingly, an Order has issued staying implementation of the Deportation Order, if it is not still stayed by operation of law, more specifically s. 49(1) of the
Act
, pending determination of the applicant's application for leave and for judicial review of the respondent's decision by which he formed the opinion that the applicant is a person who constitutes a danger to the public in Canada.
Application allowed.
