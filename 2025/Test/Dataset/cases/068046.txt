I.
Preliminary
[55] Effective decision-making by administrative agencies often involves striking a balance between general rules and the exercise of ad hoc discretion or, to put it another way, between the benefits of certainty and consistency on the one hand, and of flexibility and fact-specific solutions on the other. Legislative instruments (including such non-legally binding "soft law" documents as policy statements, guidelines, manuals, and handbooks) can assist members of the public to predict how an agency is likely to exercise its statutory discretion and to arrange their affairs accordingly, and enable an agency to deal with a problem comprehensively and proactively, rather than incrementally and reactively on a case by case basis.

Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under paragraphs 18.1(4)(
c
) and (
d
) of the
Federal Courts Act
,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA or the respondent), in which the applicant's application for an Independent Third Party Review (ITPR) was dismissed on the ground that it was time-barred.
III.
Facts
[2]
The applicant has been employed at the CRA since 1988. In 2010, the applicant was appointed to the position of auditor, classified at the AU-01 level. Following a performance evaluation, the applicant was assigned to a position of compliance programs officer, at a lower level (SP-04). Not meeting the requirements of this position, the applicant was demoted to the position of office clerk, classified at the lower level SP-02.
[3]
On August 23, 2013, the applicant's grievance regarding her demotion was rejected, while the applicant was on annual leave.
[4]
Following this rejection, after being informed by a labour relations officer from the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (the applicant's representative) of the possibility of her ITPR remedy, the applicant presented to the respondent, on her return to work on September 10, 2013, an ITPR application.
[5]
On September 19, 2013, the respondent dismissed the applicant's ITPR application on the ground that it had been presented nine days after the expiration of the time limit provided in
Form RC117, Independent Third Party Review
Application
(form RC117).
[6]
On September 20, 2013, the applicant's representative sent an e-mail to the respondent to dispute the dismissal and to describe the applicant's particular circumstances, showing that it was impossible for her to act before September 9, 2013. In this e-mail, the representative stated, among other things, that:
• The applicant received the reply to her grievance while she was on annual leave and that it was impossible to reach her during this period;
• The applicant does not have long-distance access to the CRA's computer network and, therefore, did not have access to the employer's policies and forms;
• The employer's policy on ITPR is ambiguous and does not mention any time limit for filing the ITPR application; only the form contains this information. As for the reply to the applicant's grievance, she was silent as to the possibility of filing an ITPR application and the applicable time limit;
• When she returned to work on September 9, 2013, the applicant met with her union representative so as to fill out an ITPR application;
• It was impossible for the applicant to act before September 9 and the fact that the applicant submitted her application on September 10 shows that she acted diligently.
(Applicant's Record, at p 9).
[7]
On September 24, 2013, the respondent rejected the dispute of the applicant's representative and upheld its decision of September 19, 2013.
IV.
Impugned decision
[8]
The decision subject to this judicial review is the dismissal of the applicant's ITPR application by reason of lateness, dated September 19 and 24, 2013.
[9]
The letter dismissing the ITPR application of September 19, 2013, is reproduced below:
[translation]
Following your application for Independent Third Party Review (ITPR) regarding your demotion, which does not result from a disciplinary action, the National Conflict Resolution Office regrets to inform you that your application cannot be processed for the following reason:
According to
Form RC117, Independent Third Party Review (ITPR) Application
, this form must be completed by the applicant and received at the National Conflict Resolution Office within nine calendar days following the date of notification or event engaging the applicant's right to access the ITPR recourse mechanism.
As indicated on the reply form of your fourth level grievance (final level), you signed this form on August 23, 2013. Your application was received at the National Conflict Resolution Office on September 10, 2013, i.e. 18 calendar days after the date of signing the reply form to your final level grievance.
For this reason your ITPR application is ineligible
.
(Applicant's Record, at p 8)
[Emphasis added.]
[10]
Following the e-mail sent by the applicant's representative, explaining the reasons for which it was impossible for the applicant to act before September 9, 2013, the respondent replied on September 24, 2013:
[translation]
We regret that our decision relating to Ms. Lussier's application was not what you had hoped for.
The role of the National Conflict Resolution Office (NCRO) is to administer the recourse mechanism of the Independent Third Party Review (ITPR). The NCRO determines the eligibility of applications received and ensures that all parties involved respect the roles and responsibilities described in the directives and the ITPR form. Although we acknowledge the difficulties that Ms. Lussier encountered in the process,
we cannot do anything other than respect the time limit stated on the form
. [Emphasis added.]
The NCRO, as the administrator in the ITPR process, must apply the directive as it exists and the time limits resulting from it; these time limits are identified on the ITPR form included in the directive. The application was received
after
the time limit of nine (9) days, and is thus ineligible for the ITPR process. Unfortunately, we cannot change our decision regarding this case. [Emphasis in the original.]
(Applicant's Record, at p 11)
V.
Issue
[11]
The application raises the following issue: Is the respondent's decision to dismiss the applicant's ITPR application on the ground that it was time-barred reasonable?
VI.
Parties' position
a) The applicant' position
[12]
First, the applicant argues that the respondent's categorical dismissal of her ITPR application was decided without regard for the applicant's particular circumstances and is thus unreasonable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
[13]
Then, the applicant alleges that the respondent unduly restricted its discretion by strictly applying the not mandatory time limit referred to by the CRA's
ITPR Processing Directive
(the Directive) (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[14]
Further, the applicant argues that by refusing to consider the applicant's individual circumstances surrounding the time-barred filing of her ITPR application, the respondent violated the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Ching-Chu
);
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
b) The respondent's position
[15]
Furthermore, the respondent argued that the dismissal of the applicant's late ITPR application is reasonable. In support of its claim, the respondent argued that there was no reason explaining the delay accompanying the applicant's original ITPR application dated September 10, 2013. The respondent alleged that the reasons of its decision suggest that the respondent read the explanations communicated by the applicant's representative, by indicating that it recognized [translation] "the difficulties encountered by Ms. Lussier in processing her ITPR application" (Applicant's Record, at p 11).
[16]
Moreover, the respondent alleged that the adequacy of reasons cannot, in itself, justify the Court's setting aside of an administrative body's decision (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, above, at para 12).
VII.
Standard of review
[17]
The respondent's decision to dismiss the ITPR application for being time-barred raises a question of mixed fact and law that must be reviewed on the reasonableness standard ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 10).
[18]
So as to determine whether the decision falls within the parameters of reasonableness, the Court must analyze the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47). Furthermore, the Court cannot substitute its own reasons for those of the respondent, but may, if it considers it necessary, examine the file to assess the reasonableness of the decision under review (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, above at para 15;
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[19]
Finally, the Court must also examine the context in which the decision was made ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 45).
VIII.
Analysis
[20]
The applicant's ITPR application was dismissed for the reason that it was filed beyond the time limit of nine days provided in form RC117.
[21]
At the outset, it is timely to give an overview of the ITPR application procedure so as to analyze the reasonableness of the respondent's exercise of discretion, in light of its mandate.
[22]
The ITPR procedure, which was initiated by filing form RC117 with the NCRO, is a dispute resolution mechanism established by the CRA for employees who wish to dispute the rejection of a grievance and who do not have access to arbitration provided by the
Public Service Labour Relations Act
, SC 2003, c 22, s. 2 (PSLRA).
[23]
The ITPR procedure was established under paragraph 51(1)(
g
) of the
Canada Revenue Agency Act
, SC 1999, c 17 (CRAA), below, which gives a wide grant of authorities to the CRA with respect to the development of the ITPR's parameters, including the question of applicable time limits. It should be noted that neither the CRAA nor the PSLRA imposes a limitation period with respect to the ITPR procedure.
51
. (1) The Agency may, in the exercise of its responsibilities in relation to human resources management,
[...]
(
g
) provide for the termination of employment or the demotion to a position at a lower maximum rate of pay, for reasons other than breaches of discipline or misconduct, of persons employed by the Agency and establish the circumstances and manner in which and the authority by which or by whom those measures may be taken or may be varied or rescinded in whole or in part;
51
. (1) L'Agence peut, dans l'exercice de ses attributions en matière de gestion des ressources humaines:
[...]
g
) prévoir, pour des motifs autres qu'un manquement à la discipline ou une inconduite, le licenciement ou la rétrogradation à un poste situé dans une échelle de traitement comportant un plafond inférieur et préciser dans quelles circonstances, de quelle manière, par qui et en vertu de quels pouvoirs ces mesures peuvent être appliquées, modifiées ou annulées, en tout ou en partie;
[24]
Case law suggests that the directives and soft law from administrative agencies are used to define the policies that in turn help structure the decision-makers' exercise of discretion and to guide the interpretation of their enabling legislation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 56;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). However, without minimizing the importance of the directives and soft law, which ensure some consistency and efficiency in the decision-making process, the administrative decision-makers must examine the circumstances and particular facts in each case (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Federal Court of Appeal set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 62:
[62] Nonetheless, while agencies may issue guidelines or policy statements to structure the exercise of statutory discretion in order to enhance consistency, administrative decision makers may not apply them as if they were law. Thus, a decision made solely by reference to the mandatory prescription of a guideline, despite a request to deviate from it in the light of the particular facts, may be set aside, on the ground that the decision maker's exercise of discretion was unlawfully fettered: see, for example, Maple Lodge Farms, at page 7. ...
[25]
In the context of a request for an extension of time to a visa officer, the Court set out the importance of administrative decision-makers showing flexibility and discernment in the exercise of their discretion, as appropriate (
Ching- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ):
[25] The visa officer fettered his discretion by categorically stating he never grants extensions of time to file additional information.
If the officer had considered the request for an extension, exercised his discretion, and then concluded that no extension will be granted for the following reason, then this decision would be legal. But by fettering his discretion, the visa officer is refusing to consider exercising his discretion, which is illegal
.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) per Jerome A.C.J. at page 739:
The importance of flexibility in the adoption of policy or guidelines as a means of structuring discretion
is highlighted by D.P. Jones and A.S. de Villars in
Principles of Administrative Law
, where the difference between "general" and "inflexible" policy is described at page 137:
... the existence of discretion implies the absence of a rule dictating the result in each case; the essence of discretion is that it can be exercised differently in different cases.
Each case must be looked at individually, on its own merits. Anything, therefore, which requires a delegate to exercise his discretion in a particular way may illegally limit the ambit of his power. A delegate who thus fetters his discretion commits a jurisdictional error which is capable of judicial review
.
[Emphasis added.]
[26]
It follows from this logic that in the absence of a mandatory limitation period provided by law, the respondent had the discretion to relieve the applicant of the application of the time limit it had created, based on the particular circumstances of the ITPR application. However, in articulating its decision, the respondent interpreted the time limit provided in form RC117 as mandatory, without weighing the explanations and particular circumstances of the applicant, as provided by her representative.
[27]
Specifically, the respondent narrowly assessed the scope of its discretion, by concluding that it could not [translation] "do otherwise but to respect the time limit indicated on the form" despite the fact that its mandate does not pose a risk to its discretion in accepting a late application, as appropriate. The respondent also stated in its reasons that [translation] "the NCRO, as administrator of the ITPR process, must apply the directive as it exists and the time limits that result from it" (Applicant's Record, at p 11). [Emphasis added.]
[28]
Furthermore, the harm caused to the applicant and the absence of harm caused to the respondent are factors that must be considered in assessing the reasonableness of the respondent's decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 20). In this view, it is important to point out that in this case, the strict application of the short time limit of nine days provided by form RC117 deprives the applicant of the only remedy granted to her in relation to her grievance.
[29]
The Court considers that the respondent erred by neglecting to interpret the limitation period provided in form RC117 in a manner that allows it to reach its objective and by neglecting to consider the explanations provided by the applicant regarding her particular circumstances ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 18).
IX.
Conclusion
[30]
Given the reasons above, the respondent's decision is unreasonable.
[31]
Costs are awarded on a party-and-party basis, under subsection 400(4) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106 (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
JUDGMENT
[32]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
1. The application for judicial review is allowed;
2. The decision of the Canada Revenue Agency's National Conflict Resolution Office is set aside;
3. The application of the applicant's Independent Third Party Review be reconsidered by the National Conflict Resolution Office in accordance with these reasons;
4. Costs are awarded to the applicant.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  des organismes administratifs suppose souvent un juste équilibre entre des règles d'application générale et l'exercice d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire dans les cas appropriés ou, autrement dit, entre les avantages de la certitude et de la cohérence, d'une part, et ceux de la flexibilité et des solutions adaptées à la situation, d'autre part. Certains instruments législatifs (notamment les documents qui ne sont pas obligatoires en droit, comme les énoncés de politique, directives, manuels et guides) peuvent aider les membres du public à prévoir la façon dont un organisme est susceptible d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire et à organiser leurs affaires en conséquence; ces instruments peuvent aussi permettre aux organismes de régler l'ensemble d'un problème de manière proactive, plutôt que de l'aborder de manière partielle et réactive, au cas par cas.

II. Introduction
[1]
Le juge Shore
: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire en vertu des alinéas 18.1(4)
c
) et
d
) de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  conflits [BNRC] de l'Agence du revenu du Canada [ARC ou la défenderesse], selon laquelle la demande de Révision par un tiers indépendant [RTI] de la demanderesse a été rejetée au motif qu'elle a été présentée hors délai.
III. Faits
[2]
La demanderesse est employée à l'ARC depuis 1988. En 2010, la demanderesse a accédé au poste de vérificatrice, classé au niveau AU-01. Suite à une évaluation de rendement, la demanderesse a été affectée à un poste d'agente des programmes d'observation, d'un niveau inférieur (SP-04). N'ayant pas rencontré les exigences de ce poste, la demanderesse a été rétrogradée au poste de commis de bureau, classé au niveau inférieur SP-02.
[3]
Le 23 août 2013, le grief de la demanderesse à l'égard de sa rétrogradation a été rejeté, alors que la demanderesse était en congé annuel.
[4]
Suite à ce rejet, après avoir été informée par un agent des relations de travail de l'Institut professionnel de la Fonction publique du Canada [le représentant de la demanderesse] de la possibilité de son recours en RTI, la demanderesse a présenté à la défenderesse, dès son retour au travail le 10 septembre 2013, une demande de RTI.
[5]
Le 19 septembre 2013, la défenderesse a rejeté la demande de RTI de la demanderesse au motif qu'elle avait été présentée neuf jours après l'expiration du délai prévu au
Formulaire RC117, Demande de révision par un tiers indépendant
[formulaire RC117].
[6]
Le 20 septembre 2013, le représentant de la demanderesse a transmis un courriel à la défenderesse afin de contester le refus et de faire état des circonstances particulières de la demanderesse, démontrant qu'elle était dans l'impossibilité d'agir avant le 9 septembre 2013. Dans ce courriel, le représentant indique notamment que:
• La demanderesse a reçu la réponse à son grief alors qu'elle était en congé annuel et qu'elle était impossible à joindre durant cette période;
• La demanderesse ne possède aucun accès à distance au réseau informatique de l'ARC et n'avait donc pas accès aux politiques et aux formulaires de l'employeur;
• La politique de l'employeur relative à la RTI est ambiguë et ne fait mention d'aucun délai quant au dépôt de la demande de RTI; seul le formulaire contient cette information. Quant à la réponse au grief de la demanderesse, elle est silencieuse quant à la possibilité de déposer une demande de RTI et du délai applicable;
• Dès son retour au travail, le 9 septembre 2013, la demanderesse a rencontré son représentant syndical afin de remplir une demande de RTI;
• La demanderesse était dans l'impossibilité d'agir avant le 9 septembre et le fait que la demanderesse ait soumis sa demande le 10 septembre démontre qu'elle a agi avec diligence.
(Dossier de la demanderesse, à la p 9).
[7]
Le 24 septembre 2013, la défenderesse a rejeté la contestation du représentant de la demanderesse et a maintenu sa décision du 19 septembre 2013.
IV. Décision contestée
[8]
La décision assujettie au présent contrôle judiciaire est le rejet de la demande de RTI de la demanderesse pour cause de tardivité, datée des 19 et 24 septembre 2013.
[9]
La lettre de refus de la demande de RTI du 19 septembre 2013 est reproduite ci-dessous:
Suite à votre demande de révision par un tiers indépendant (RTI) concernant votre rétrogradation ne découlant pas d'une mesure disciplinaire, le Bureau national de résolution de conflits a le regret de vous informer que votre demande ne pourra être traitée pour la raison suivante:
Selon le
Formulaire RC117, Demande de révision par un tiers indépendant (RTI)
, ce formulaire doit être complété par le demandeur et reçu au Bureau national de résolution de conflits dans les neuf jours civils suivant la date de notification ou événement entrainant le droit du demandeur d'accéder au mécanisme de recours de la RTI.
Tel qu'indiqué sur le formulaire de réponse à votre grief au 4e palier (palier final), vous avez signé ce formulaire le 23 août 2013. Votre demande a été reçue au Bureau national de résolution de conflits le 10 septembre 2013, soit 18 jours civils après la date de signature du formulaire de réponse à votre grief au palier final.
Pour cette raison votre demande de RTI n'est pas éligible
.
(Dossier de la demanderesse, à la p 8)
[Je souligne.]
[10]
Suite au courriel transmis par le représentant de la demanderesse, expliquant les motifs pour lesquels la demanderesse était dans l'impossibilité d'agir avant le 9 septembre 2013, la défenderesse a répondu, le 24 septembre 2013:
Nous regrettons que notre décision par rapport à la demande de Mme Lussier ne fût pas celle que vous auriez espérée.
Le rôle du Bureau national de résolution de conflits (BNRC) est d'administrer le mécanisme de recours de Révision par un tiers indépendant (RTI). Le BNRC détermine l'admissibilité des demandes reçues et s'assure que toutes les parties impliquées respectent les rôles et responsabilités décrits dans les directives et le formulaire RTI. Quoique nous reconnaissons les difficultés rencontrées par Mme Lussier dans le processus,
nous ne pouvons faire autrement que de respecter le délai indiqué sur le formulaire
. [Je souligne.]
Le BNRC en tant qu'administrateur du processus de RTI doit appliquer la directive telle qu'elle existe ainsi que les délais qui s'en suivent; ces délais sont identifiés sur le formulaire de RTI inclus dans la directive. La demande a été reçue
après
le délai de neuf (9) jours, donc n'est pas admissible au processus de RTI. Malheureusement nous ne pouvons pas modifier notre décision concernant ce cas. [Souligné dans l'original.]
(Dossier de la demanderesse, à la p 11)
V. Question en litige
[11]
La demande soulève la question en litige suivante: La décision de la défenderesse de rejeter la demande de RTI de la demanderesse pour le motif qu'elle a été présentée hors délai est-elle raisonnable?
VI. Position des parties
a) La position de la demanderesse
[12]
D'une part, la demanderesse soutient que le rejet catégorique par la défenderesse de sa demande de RTI a été décidé sans égard aux circonstances particulières de la demanderesse et est donc déraisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[13]
Ensuite, la demanderesse allègue que la défenderesse a indûment restreint son pouvoir discrétionnaire en appliquant strictement le délai non-obligatoire auquel renvoie la
Directive de l'ARC sur le traitement des demandes de RTI
[la Directive] (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 39;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[14]
De plus, la demanderesse soutient qu'en refusant de considérer les circonstances individuelles de la demanderesse entourant le dépôt tardif de sa demande de RTI, la défenderesse a enfreint les principes de justice naturelle et d'équité procédurale (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Ching-Chu
];
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22 [
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 129 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
b) La position de la défenderesse
[15]
D'autre part, la défenderesse soutient que le rejet de la demande de RTI tardive de la demanderesse est raisonnable. Au soutien de sa prétention, la défenderesse soutient qu'aucun motif expliquant le retard n'accompagnait la demande de RTI initiale de la demanderesse datée du 10 septembre 2013. La défenderesse allègue qu'il se dégage des motifs de sa décision que la défenderesse a pris connaissance des explications communiquées par le représentant de la demanderesse, en indiquant avoir reconnu « les difficultés rencontrées par Mme Lussier dans le processus de sa demande RTI » (Dossier de la demanderesse, à la p 11).
[16]
De plus, la défenderesse allègue qu'une insuffisance de motifs ne peut, en soi, justifier l'annulation par la Cour d'une décision d'un organisme administratif (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, ci-dessus au para 12).
VII. Norme de contrôle
[17]
La décision de la défenderesse de rejeter la demande de RTI pour cause d'avoir été déposée hors délai soulève une question mixte de fait et de droit devant être contrôlée selon la norme de la décision raisonnable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 10).
[18]
Afin de déterminer si la décision tombe dans les paramètres de la raisonnabilité, la Cour doit procéder à l'analyse de la justification de la décision, de la transparence et de l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi que de l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 47). De plus, la Cour ne peut substituer ses propres motifs à ceux de la défenderesse, mais peut toutefois, si elle le juge nécessaire, examiner le dossier pour apprécier le caractère raisonnable de la décision révisée (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, ci-dessus au para 15;
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[19]
Finalement, la Cour doit également examiner le contexte dans lequel la décision a été rendue ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 18;
Canada (Procureur général) c Abraham
, 2012 CAF 266 aux para 42 à 45).
VIII. Analyse
[20]
La demande de RTI de la demanderesse a été rejetée pour le motif qu'elle a été présentée en dehors du délai de neuf jours prescrit par le formulaire RC117.
[21]
D'emblée, il est opportun d'exposer sommairement la procédure de demande de RTI afin d'analyser la raisonnabilité de l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire de la défenderesse, à la lumière de son mandat.
[22]
La procédure de RTI, qui est initiée par la présentation au BNRC du formulaire RC117, est un mécanisme de résolution de litiges établi par l'ARC pour les employés souhaitant contester le rejet d'un grief et qui n'ont pas accès au recours en arbitrage prévu par la
Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique
, LC 2003, c 22, art 2 [LRTFP].
[23]
La procédure de RTI a été établie en vertu de l'alinéa 51(1)
g
) de la
Loi sur l'Agence du revenu du Canada
, LC 1999, c 17 [LARC], ci-dessous, qui accorde une large attribution des pouvoirs à l'ARC quant à l'élaboration des paramètres de la RTI, incluant la question des délais applicables. Il est à noter que ni la LARC, ni la LRTFP n'impose un délai de prescription à l'égard de la procédure en RTI.
51
. (1) L'Agence peut, dans l'exercice de ses attributions en matière de gestion des ressources humaines:
[...]
g) prévoir, pour des motifs autres qu'un manquement à la discipline ou une inconduite, le licenciement ou la rétrogradation à un poste situé dans une échelle de traitement comportant un plafond inférieur et préciser dans quelles circonstances, de quelle manière, par qui et en vertu de quels pouvoirs ces mesures peuvent être appliquées, modifiées ou annulées, en tout ou en partie;
51
. (1) The Agency may, in the exercise of its responsibilities in relation to human resources management,
[...]
(
g
) provide for the termination of employment or the demotion to a position at a lower maximum rate of pay, for reasons other than breaches of discipline or misconduct, of persons employed by the Agency and establish the circumstances and manner in which and the authority by which or by whom those measures may be taken or may be varied or rescinded in whole or in part;
[24]
Il se dégage de la jurisprudence que les directives et les règles non-contraignantes des organismes administratifs servent à définir les politiques qui permettent à leur tour de structurer l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire des décideurs, ainsi que de guider l'interprétation de leurs lois habilitantes ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 56;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Sans minimiser l'importance des directives et des règles non-contraignantes, qui assurent une certaine cohérence et efficacité au sein du processus décisionnel, les décideurs administratifs doivent toutefois examiner les circonstances et les faits particuliers dans chaque affaire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La Cour d'appel fédérale a énoncé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 62:
[62] Néanmoins, si les organismes sont libres de donner des directives ou de formuler des énoncés de politique visant à coordonner l'exercice d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire conféré par la loi afin de favoriser la cohérence, les décideurs administratifs ne peuvent pas appliquer ces directives et politiques comme si elles constituaient le droit. Aussi une décision fondée uniquement sur les consignes impératives d'une directive malgré une demande pour qu'il y soit fait exception en raison d'une situation particulière, pourra-t-elle être annulée au motif que le décideur a illicitement entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire: voir, par exemple, l'arrêt
Maple Lodge Farms
, à la page 7.
[25]
Dans le contexte d'une demande de prorogation de délai auprès d'un agent de visa, la Cour énonce l'importance pour les décideurs administratifs de faire preuve de flexibilité et de discernement dans l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire, selon le cas (
Ching-Chu
, ci-dessus):
[25] L'agent des visas a restreint indûment son pouvoir discrétionnaire en déclarant, de manière catégorique, qu'il n'accorde jamais de prorogation de délai aux fins du dépôt de renseignements supplémentaires.
Si l'agent avait examiné la demande de prorogation de délai et s'il avait exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire puis conclu qu'aucune prorogation ne devait être accordée pour un motif précis, sa décision aurait alors été valide. Cependant, en restreignant indûment son pouvoir discrétionnaire, l'agent des visas refuse d'étudier l'opportunité d'exercer ce pouvoir, ce qui est contraire à la loi.

L'importance de la flexibilité dans l'adoption d'une politique ou de lignes directrices en tant que moyen de structurer le pouvoir discrétionnaire
est mise en lumière par D. P. Jones et A. S. de Villars dans leur ouvrage
Principles of Administrative Law

[TRADUCTION] [...] l'existence du pouvoir discrétionnaire implique l'absence d'une règle dictant le résultat dans chaque cas; le pouvoir discrétionnaire réside essentiellement dans le fait que son exercice varie selon les cas.
Et chaque cas est un cas d'espèce. En conséquence, tout ce qui exige d'un délégué qu'il exerce son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'une manière particulière peut illégalement restreindre la portée de son pouvoir. Un délégué qui entrave ainsi son pouvoir discrétionnaire excède sa compétence et peut faire l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire.
[Je souligne.]
[26]
Il découle de cette logique qu'en l'absence d'un délai de prescription obligatoire prévu par une loi, la défenderesse avait le pouvoir discrétionnaire de soustraire la demanderesse à l'application du délai qu'elle a elle-même créé, selon les circonstances particulières de la demande de RTI. Cependant, dans l'articulation de sa décision, la défenderesse interprète le délai prévu au formulaire RC117 de façon impérative, sans toutefois pondérer les explications et les circonstances particulières de la demanderesse, telles que fournies par son représentant.
[27]
Plus précisément, la défenderesse a apprécié la portée de son pouvoir discrétionnaire de façon étroite, en concluant ne pas pouvoir « faire autrement que de respecter le délai indiqué sur le formulaire » malgré que son mandat ne pose pas d'entrave à son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'accepter une demande tardive, selon le cas. La défenderesse indique également dans ses motifs que « le BNRC, en tant qu'administrateur du processus de RTI
doit appliquer la directive telle qu'elle existe
ainsi que les délais qui s'en suivent » (Dossier de la demanderesse, à la p 11). [Je souligne.]
[28]
De plus, le préjudice causé à la demanderesse et l'absence de préjudice causé à la défenderesse sont des facteurs devant être considérés dans l'appréciation du caractère raisonnable de la décision de la défenderesse ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 20). Dans cette vue, il importe de souligner qu'en l'espèce, l'application stricte du court délai de neuf jours prévu par le formulaire RC117 prive la demanderesse du seul recours qui lui est accordé relativement à son grief.
[29]
La Cour considère que la défenderesse a erré en omettant d'interpréter le délai de prescription prévu au formulaire RC117 d'une manière qui permette de réaliser son objet et en omettant de considérer les explications fournies par la demanderesse concernant ses circonstances particulières ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 18).
IX. Conclusion
[30]
Compte tenu des motifs qui précèdent, la décision de la défenderesse est déraisonnable.
[31]
Les dépens sont accordés sur la base de frais entre parties, en vertu du paragraphe 400(4) des
Règles des Cours fédérales
, DORS/98-106 (
