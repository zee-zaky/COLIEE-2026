McNair, J.
: This is an appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trademarks refusing the appellant's application for registration of the trademark "Just Workwear" for use in association with certain items of work clothing on grounds of the likelihood of confusion with the second respondent's trade name and lack of distinctiveness.
[2]
The appellant, a company incorporated under the laws of Canada and carrying on the business of manufacturing work clothing since 1983, filed on October 17, 1984, an application to register the trademark "Just Workwear" for use in association with coveralls, overalls, shirts, pants, vests, shop coats, work jackets and ponchos. The appellant claimed use of the trademark in Canada in association with these wares since September 17, 1984, and disclaimed the right to exclusive use of the word "workwear" apart from the trademark. The application was advertised for opposition purposes on June 12, 1985.
[3]
The first respondent, Work Wear Corporation Inc., a United States corporation having its principal office in Cleveland, Ohio, has carried on the business of manufacturing and retailing garments, especially employee uniforms, in both the United States and Canada since 1971. The first respondent is the holder of Canadian trademark and design registration No. 211,215 for "The World of Work Wear" since January 9, 1976, for use in association with blazers, slacks and jackets and the furnishing of employee clothing on a periodic basis. The words "work wear" were disclaimed, apart from the trademark. The second respondent, Work Wear Corporation of Canada Ltd., was formed on March 30, 1975, through the amalgamation of a number of Canadian companies owned by the first respondent, and since that date has been in the business of renting, leasing, cleaning and repairing and, more recently, also selling industrial garments such as uniforms and linens. The second respondent is a registered user of the first respondent's trademark.
[4]
On November 12, 1985, the two respondents jointly filed a statement of opposition to the appellant's registration of the trademark "Just Workwear". The grounds of opposition included, inter alia, the following:
"2. The applicant is not the person entitled to registration of the mark having regard to the provisions of ss. 37(2)(c) and 16(1) of the Trade Marks Act and the following facts:
. . . . .
(c) At the date on which the applicant allegedly first used the mark 'Just Workwear' in Canada, such mark was confusing with the trade name of Work Wear Corporation of Canada Ltd., previously and continuously used in Canada in the conduct of its business since at least as early as March 1975, including the activities set out in subparagraph (a) hereof. Work Wear Corporation of Canada Ltd. continues to carry on business under this trade name in Canada.
"3. The trademark of application No. 530,482 is not distinctive having regard to the provisions of s. 37(2)(d) of the Trade Marks Act, since it does not actually distinguish the wares of the applicant from the wares and business of Work Wear Corporation of Canada Ltd., nor is it adapted to so distinguish, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 above."
[5]
On December 23, 1985, the appellant filed and served a counter-statement. The only evidence adduced by the appellant in the opposition proceedings was the affidavit of Donna Harris, a trademark searcher, deposing to state of the register searches conducted on January 26, 1987. The respondents filed as their evidence-in-chief the affidavit of William A. Wharton, Vice-President, Administration, and Corporate Secretary of the second respondent, Work Wear Corporation of Canada Ltd. There was no cross-examination on these affidavits, and no reply evidence was filed by the respondents. Only the appellant filed a written argument and no oral hearing was conducted. The Registrar's decision was rendered on June 30, 1988, by Opposition Board member, David J. Martin. Essentially, he found that the appellant's trademark was confusing with the second respondent's trade name which had been extensively used in Canada, and that the appellant had failed to satisfy the onus of establishing that its trademark was distinctive.
[6]
On appeal, the appellant adduced new evidence in the form of an affidavit of Harvey Goffman, its Secretary-Treasurer, as well as two affidavits directed to supporting its salient proposition that the words "work wear" or "workwear" were in fact generic and common to the trade. The evidence adduced by the respondents consisted of the affidavit of Arthur H. Hughes, Chief Financial Officer and present Corporate Secretary of Work Wear Corporation of Canada Ltd., as supplementary to the previously filed Wharton affidavit, and also the affidavit of their trademark searcher, Lynda Doxsee, regarding computer data searches for trademarks featuring the element "Just" for use in association with certain items of clothing and services related thereto.
[7]
In concluding that the appellant had failed to evidence the distinctiveness of its trademark, the Registrar confined himself to determining the issue of confusion between the appellant's mark and the second respondent's trade name. He did not consider, nor indeed even mention, the likelihood of confusion between the appellant's mark and the first respondent's trademark "The World of Work Wear", notwithstanding that this was specifically alleged in the statement of opposition. Under the circumstances, I feel obliged to restrict the issues bearing on confusion to the same area of controversy that featured the Registrar, namely, the appellant's mark versus the second respondent's trade name.
[8]
The Registrar applied the provisions of ss. 6(3) and 6(5) of the Trade Marks Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10, in reaching his conclusion that the appellant's trademark lacked distinctiveness. Seemingly, he did so because he thought it "useful to consider the issue of confusion between the applicant's mark and the second opponent's trade name" in assessing the ground of nondistinctiveness. Clearly, he was of the view that the material time for considering this ground was the date of filing of the opposition.
[9]
Counsel for the appellant drew a parallel between the present case and that of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 454 (F.C.T.D.), inasmuch as the essential grounds of opposition in both cases were based on the issue of confusion. He argued, therefore, that the material date for determining the confusion issue in this case was the date of the appellant's first use of the trademark on September 17, 1984. In his submission, the second respondent's sales activities at that time were dissimilar to those of the appellant, being devoted primarily to the "business of renting, leasing, cleaning and repairing industrial garments, such as uniforms and linens".
[10]
While I agree that the essential issue raised by the opposition was the likelihood of confusion between the appellant's mark and the second respondent's trade name, it is not without significance that the Registrar addressed and determined that issue in the overall context of lack of distinctiveness. The material time for considering that ground of opposition, according to the preponderance of authority, is the date of the filing of the opposition: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), per Cattanach, J., at p. 52. In my opinion, the Registrar did not commit any palpable error in the present case by considering evidence bearing on the issue of confusion as of that date.
[11]
Counsel for the appellant also stressed that there was a great deal of uncertainty as to the exact nature of the second respondent's trade name, pointing out that there were a number of varying references to that name in the supporting documentation. According to the Wharton affidavit, the words "Work Wear" are emphasized in the second respondent's business forms and in plasticized equipment labels, as well as being prominently displayed on the side panels of delivery trucks and featuring graphically in all of the second respondent's advertisements. Mr. Wharton deposed in paragraph 4 of his affidavit that the words "Work Wear" constituted the second respondent's trade name. The supplementary affidavit of Arthur H. Hughes, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary of the second respondent, averred that "Work Wear" was the company's "main trade name". Invariably, the words "Work Wear" appearing in association with the above-mentioned items are not depicted in splendid isolation, but rather are shown as part of a design logo in which, next to a design pattern, the words "Work Wear" are shown in large bold letters above the words "Corporation of Canada Ltd." in much smaller and lighter print, and are thus. represented:
[Graph omitted. See original source.]
[12]
At the hearing of the appeal, respondent's counsel sought to clarify the fact that the trade name is actually "Work Wear Corporation of Canada Ltd." and that the references to the trade name "Work Wear" are simply the result of a natural tendency on the part of both the company and the public to abbreviate such a lengthy name. The tendency of the public to abbreviate is, of course, a factor to be considered in determining the likelihood of confusion: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 71.
[13]
By virtue of s. 6(3) of the Trade Marks Act, it seems to me that the key issue is whether the concurrent use of the appellant's mark "Just Workwear" and the second respondent's trade name in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares associated with the trademark and those associated with the business carried on under the trade name were manufactured, sold or leased by the same person. In determining the issue of confusion, regard must be had to all the surrounding circumstances, including the criteria specifically enumerated in s. 6(5) of the Act which reads:
"6(5) In determining whether trademarks or trade names are confusing, the court or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks or trade names and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trademarks or trade names have been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or trade names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them."
[14]
The onus rests on the appellant throughout to establish that there is no likelihood of any reasonable prospect of confusion between its trademark and the trade name of the second respondent. Confusion is a question of fact and courts are generally reluctant to reverse the factual findings of a Registrar unless clearly satisfied that he came to a wrong conclusion thereon or unless further evidence is introduced on appeal that might so significantly change the factual situation before the Registrar as to indicate the necessity of reaching a different result: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.), per Davis, J., at p. 172.
[15]
I turn now to a review of the five criteria prescribed by s. 6(5), both as to the manner in which they were applied by the Registrar and in light of the new evidence adduced on the appeal.
A. Inherent Distinctiveness
[16]
The Registrar found that the second respondent's trade name was inherently weak by reason that the words "work wear" were descriptive of the nature of its business. He concluded, however, that the "extensive sales effected by the second opponent in association with its trade name" had made that name well-known in Canada. As for the appellant's mark, the Registrar also found it to be inherently weak on the ground that the entire trademark "Just Workwear" was "arguably descriptive of the applied for wares". In the absence of evidence of use, he concluded that the appellant's mark "had not become known at all in Canada as of the material time".
[17]
Appellant's counsel filed new evidence on the appeal to support his submission that the term "work wear", whether written singly as one word or separately as two, was generic and common to the trade. The Registrar was unable to find on the basis of the evidence before him that there had been common adoption and use of the words "work wear" or "workwear" for clothing items.
[18]
Counsel for the appellant submits that any lack of evidence in this regard has been remedied on the appeal. Appellant's counsel relies strongly on the cases of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 16, to support his submission that the second respondent should not be permitted to unfairly monopolize words of such common usage as "work wear" in association with items of apparel.
[19]
Respondents' counsel submits that the tests in both of these cases were quite different from the present situation, pointing out that the General Motors case involved expungement proceedings and the case of S.C. Johnson was an infringement action. In her submission, the Registrar's finding that the second respondent's trade name had become well-known through extensive sales was uncontradicted.
[20]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.L.), said (at p. 691 S.C.R., p. 116 C.P.R.):
"It comes in the end, I think, to no more than this, that where a trader adopts words in common use for his trade name, some risk of confusion is inevitable. But that risk must be run unless the first user is allowed unfairly to monopolize the words. The court will accept comparatively small differences as sufficient to avert confusion. A greater degree of discrimination may fairly be expected from the public where a trade name consists wholly or in part of words descriptive of the articles to be sold or the services to be rendered."
[21]
Fox, The Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition (3rd Ed.), makes the following statement at p. 175:
"... When the application reaches the opposition stage the fact that elements of the mark offered for registration are common to the trade falls to be decided upon the basis of proved user."
[22]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. 40, Ritchie, J., said at p. 138 (S.C.R.) (p. 40 (C.P.R.)):
"... I am, as I have stated, of opinion that the essential question to be determined is whether the use of the word 'Smoothies' by the respondent would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares associated with that word and those associated with the registered trademarks of the appellant were produced or marketed by the same company and I do not think that this necessarily involves a resemblance between the dictionary meaning of the word used in the trademark applied for and those used in the registered trademarks. It is enough, in my view, if the words used in the registered and unregistered trademarks are likely to suggest the idea that the wares with which they are associated were produced or marketed by the same person. This is the approach which appears to me to have been adopted by the Registrar of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  138 C.P.R.:
"... I reiterate that the trademarks of the respondent are in no way on trial here. Nor is the respondent suing the applicant for infringement of the former's registered trademarks. What the chairman had to decide on behalf of the registrar, and what I have to decide, is whether the appellant has demonstrated that there is no likelihood of confusion between its proposed trademarks and the proposed trademarks of the respondent referred to in its opposition."
[23]
Taking the date of filing of the statement of opposition on November 12, 1985, as the material time, the state of the register evidence shows, in addition to registration of the first respondent's mark, a registration for "Woodward's Seven Star Workwear" dated 1948 as well as six registrations by Mark's Work Wearhouse Ltd. of the trademark "Mark's Work Wearhouse" and various design marks exhibiting these words. Further affidavit evidence filed in the appeal showed the use of the word "workwear" as an indexing term in the 1983 and 1984 editions of Fraser's Canadian Trade Directory and the similar use of the same word in both Eaton's and Sears catalogues for 1985 and prior years. Clearly, the evidence would seem to indicate that the expression "workwear" is a dictionary word commonly used to describe work clothing or apparel. By the same token, the affidavit of Lynda Doxsee establishes with respect to the prefix "Just" that there were prior to 1985, 22 Canadian registrations of trademarks featuring the modifier "Just" for use in association with sundry items of wearing apparel.
[24]
The Registrar's finding that the second respondent's "extensive sales" had made its trade name well-known in Canada was predicated, to some degree at least, on his taking the date of filing of the opposition as the material time. As previously indicated, I see no error here. The Registrar found the second respondent's total sales for the period 1979 to 1985 to be in excess of $425 million, based on the annual sales figures set out in the Wharton affidavit. Evidence on the appeal establishes that the appellant's sales in the first year of use of its trademark in Canada were approximately $1.5 million, whereas the second respondent's sales during the same period were in excess of $75 million. Considering the evidence in its entirety, especially in reference to proven user, I am unable to conclude that the Registrar went seriously astray in determining that the appellant's mark had not become sufficiently known in Canada at the material time to actually distinguish its wares and services from those of the second respondent.
B. Length Of Time In Use
[25]
The appellant's use of its trademark "Just Workwear" commenced on September 17, 1984. According to paragraph 3 of the Wharton affidavit, the second respondent commenced use of its trade name "Work Wear" in Canada in association with its business of renting, cleaning and repairing industrial garments in 1975. Paragraph 11 of the same affidavit makes reference to the second respondent's product range since September 1984, in terms both of sale and rental. Alluding to the criterion of s. 6(5)(b) of the Act, Fox, Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition (3rd Ed.), says at p. 153:
"If a trademark is newly adopted or has been on the register for only a short time it may generally be presumed that it cannot have received wide acceptance in the eyes of the public. On the other hand, if a trademark has been on the register for many years it is probable that it has been used for a comparable period and that it will have acquired the sort of reputation and goodwill that the section is designed to protect."
The Registrar found that s. 6(5)(b) clearly favoured the opponent. Counsel for the appellant acknowledged that the second respondent's trade name may have been in use for a long time, but argued that such use was limited to the rental of industrial garments and did not comprehend the sale of work wear. There is ample evidence that the second respondent's trade name was in use in association with rentals of industrial garments since at least 1975 and in association with the sale of these wares to industrial customers since September of 1984. To my mind, the Registrar simply found that the length of time in use vis-à-vis the appellant's trademark and the second respondent's trade name clearly favoured the latter, and I see nothing wrong in that.
C. The Nature Of The Wares, Etc.
[26]
The wares of the second respondent and those of the appellant are virtually identical. With the exception of ponchos, the second respondent manufactures and distributes all of the wares listed in the appellant's application. The product line of the second respondent also extends to wares not supplied by the appellant, such as linens and dust control products.
D. The Nature Of The Trade
[27]
Appellant's counsel argues with respect to this criterion that the trades are dissimilar. In his submission, any lack of evidence before the Registrar has been remedied on the appeal. Referring to the appellant's submission regarding dissimilarity of trades, the Registrar found as follows:
"... However, the second opponent not only rents work clothes but also sells them. In any event, the applicant has not evidenced the nature of its trade nor has it restricted its statement of wares to more clearly define its trade. Thus, I must conclude that it could also be in the business of renting the wares listed in its application."
In reaching this result, he found earlier that the second respondent was "in the business of renting (and more recently, selling) the very wares for which the applicant seeks registration". In my view, there was sufficient evidence to support the Registrar's finding of similarity of trade channels with respect to the competing wares, and the likely potentiality of overlap in the area of rental.
[28]
The supplementary affidavit of Arthur H. Hughes filed on the appeal evidences the fact that the second respondent has been engaged since 1975 in the business of the manufacture, rental and sale of "employee garments", defined as including employee uniforms and protective clothing of all sorts, for use in the industrial sector and not the retail consumer market. The concluding portion of paragraph 6 of the Hughes affidavit describes the nature of the trade as follows:
"6. ... Work Wear (Canada) offers such employee garments for retail to its industrial clientele, and also offers a rental service in respect of these garments, the latter generally including a weekly or bi-weekly pick up for cleaning. In addition to garments, Work Wear (Canada) also offers other fabric items on a similar basis, such as cloth towelling for use in washroom dispensers."
Mr. Hughes deposed in paragraph 7 of his affidavit as follows:
"7. I have read and reviewed the Affidavit of Harvey Goffman, particularly the list of clients of the appellant, Triple G. Manufacturing Inc. set out in paragraph 6 of Mr. Goffman's Affidavit. From company records, I have ascertained that at least six of these businesses are also customers of Work Wear (Canada) through its Montreal division, McEwen Sainthill, namely:
Metropolitan Jobbing
Greenberg
Claudette Croteau Inc.
Surplus Du Nord
Magasin Latulippe
Les Surplus Langlais"
As I see it, this additional evidence takes matters beyond the mere probability of overlapping channels of trade and affirms that the respective wares are being sold in similar channels of trade to the same type of customer. Moreover, as has been frequently pointed out, evidence of actual confusion is unnecessary since the issue is not whether there has ben confusion, but whether confusion was likely to occur: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 15. In my opinion, the new evidence on appeal confirms the correctness of the Registrar's decision with respect to the similarity of trades.
E. The Degree Of Resemblance
[29]
The Registrar found a high degree of resemblance between the appellant's mark and the second respondent's name in all respects. According to his perception, the format used by the second respondent emphasized the words "work wear" and the dominant portion of the appellant's mark was the word "workwear".
[30]
Respondents' counsel agreed, of course, with this finding. In her submission, it was simply the result of considering the similarities between the trademark and the trade name rather than focusing on the differences. Appellant's counsel argued that the Registrar's finding on the degree of resemblance represented an improper dissection of the trademark and trade name by placing emphasis on the dominant features thereof rather than viewing them in their totality.
[31]
It is a well-established principle that, in determining the likelihood of confusion, trademarks are not to be dissected into separate compartments and viewed for similarity, but rather are to be looked at in their totality: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.), per Thorson, P., at p. 136. The principle was affirmed by Heald, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 29 (F.C.A.), when he said at p. 35 C.P.R.:
"... the issue of similarity must be determined on the effect of the marks when taken as a whole or in totality. Marks should not be laid side by side for the purpose of analysis as to similarities and differences ..."
However, the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  did not appear to be unduly concerned with the trial judge's concentration on the words "Style" and "Hy*Style" as the dominant features on which the issue of likelihood of confusion should be resolved in an expungement proceeding. This had been a main point of the appellant's argument on appeal. Laskin, J., commented on this at p. 979 as follows:
"The trial judge recognized that on the question of resemblance 'the whole of the design or get-up must be looked at' in respect of each of the competing marks. Although he selected the words 'Style' and 'Hy Style' as the dominant features, he also found that 'the other indicia in [the respondent's] trademark in relation to the indicia in the get-up of the unregistered trademark of the applicant other than the word "Style" in it are not things which are or were likely to cause confusion in the minds of the public'. I agree with this finding, and I think that it reinforces the result at which the trial judge arrived."
[32]
Appellant's counsel alludes to the statement of Rand, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appearance of the words. But in determining that we must take into account the entire circumstances of the trade, including the prices, the class of people purchasing, and the ordinary manner in which they do that."
He utilizes this to make the point that the parties' clientele are the purchasing managers of corporations and not the ordinary consumer in the retail marketplace. It follows, in his submission, that the persons responsible for purchasing the parties' wares would have no difficulty in distinguishing between them. With respect, I am unable to agree.
[33]
Considering the appellant's trademark and the second respondent's trade name in totality as regards the degree of resemblance in appearance or sound or suggestive ideas, it seems to me that what impacts on the senses, as a matter of first impression, are the words "work wear" and that the prefix modifier "just" does nothing to lessen this impression. I am satisfied on the evidence in its entirety that the words of the appellant's trademark "Just Workwear", for which registration was sought, and those of the second respondent's trade name Work Wear, with or without the addition of the words Corporation of Canada Ltd., would be likely, to paraphrase Ritchie, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  produced or marketed by the same person".
Conclusion
[34]
In the result, I am of the opinion that the Registrar rightly refused the appellant's application to register the trademark "Just Workwear" on the grounds of the likelihood of confusion and lack of distinctiveness. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
