Roy, J.
July 28, 2014.

Camille Audain, for the respondent.
Solicitors of Record:
William F. Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Edmonton, Alberta, for the respondent.
Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2014] F.T.R. TBEd. JL.063.
[1]
Roy, J.
: Fiona Jane Edwards, the applicant, seeks to appeal, pursuant to subsection 14(5) of the
Citizenship Act
, RSC, 1985, c C-29 [the Act], the decision of a Citizenship Judge, on September 3, 2013, to refuse her Canadian citizenship application.
[2]
The facts of the case are simple and undisputed. The applicant is a citizen of the United Kingdom. She immigrated to Canada on March 3, 2003. Mrs Edwards is the mother of a child born on June 1, 2002. The daughter is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Canada. The applicant acquired permanent resident status on March 15, 2005. The application for citizenship was made on May 15, 2009. Given her frequent absences from Canada for work and vacations, the applicant had accumulated 892 days of physical presence in Canada.
[3]
Section 5 of the Act provides for the conditions under which citizenship shall be granted. It is paragraph 5(1)(c) that is relevant for our purposes:
Grant of citizenship
5. (1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who
...
(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:
(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and
(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;
Attribution de la citoyenneté
5. (1) Le ministre attribue la citoyenneté à toute personne qui, à la fois:
...
c) est un résident permanent au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés et a, dans les quatre ans qui ont précédé la date de sa demande, résidé au Canada pendant au moins trois ans en tout, la durée de sa résidence étant calculée de la manière suivante:
(i) un demi-jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada avant son admission à titre de résident permanent,
(ii) un jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada après son admission à titre de résident permanent;
[4]
In her decision, the Citizenship Judge concluded that the relevant period in order to assess the residence requirements was May 15, 2005 to May 15, 2009, the day she made her application. Given that permanent residence was acquired some two months before the application to become a citizen was made, Mrs Edward showed an early interest in being awarded the Canadian citizenship.
[5]
However, by making her application so early after becoming a permanent resident, the applicant fell short of the number of days of residence found in paragraph 5(1)(c). Out of the 1460 days during that period, between May 15, 2005 and May 15, 2009, it is not disputed that the applicant was 203 days short as the Act seems to require at least 1095 days out of 1460 days. At 892 days, the applicant was in Canada 61% of 4 years. Indeed, the shortfall of 203 days is close to 20% short of the target.
[6]
In the case at hand, the Citizenship Judge considered the availability of three accepted tests for residency and chose the one requiring the physical presence for 1095 days out of 1460 days. There was no ambiguity in the choice that was made. The Citizenship Judge also specifically declined to make favourable recommendations to waive some requirements under subsection 5(3) and for a discretionary grant of citizenship under subsection 5(4) in special circumstances, concluding that there was no evidence to justify such a recommendation.
[7]
The applicant takes issue with the choice made by the Citizenship Judge to pick a test, one dubbed "physical presence", which resulted in the decision to dismiss her application for citizenship. She claims that the use of the criteria found in
Re Koo
, [1993] 1 FC 286 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], another test that is available and has been used by some judges in some circumstances, should have produced a different result in view of her circumstances and justification for not meeting the threshold of 1095 days.
[8]
It will not be necessary to examine what standard of review should apply and whether or not the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria could have been satisfied in this case because I have concluded that the Citizenship Judge was entitled to decide to rely on the "physical presence" test as she did.
[9]
Mrs Edwards does a remarkable job of presenting the views of some of my colleagues who have lamented the availability of different tests to Citizenship Judges. That has made some conclude that the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test ought to prevail. With great respect, I disagree.
[10]
In spite of what would appear to many to be the intent of Parliament that a person be physically present, Thurlow ACJ ruled in
Re Papadogiorgakis
, [1978] 2 FC 208 [
Papadogiorgakis
], that it would be possible to consider a different period of time because the word "residence" is not defined in the Act. Residence does not require physical presence as long as the person has centralized her mode of living somewhere in Canada.
[11]
I would have thought that Parliament's intent could rather easily be deciphered. I find it difficult to accept that deemed residence is possible where a non-permanent resident is allowed, through a formula, one-half day of residence for every day that person is residing in Canada. Parliament's intent, surely, is that the non-permanent resident be in Canada for that residence to count as half for the purpose of being granted citizenship. The alternative would lead to an absurdity: a non-permanent resident could be credited on half-day of residence for residing outside of Canada. The purposive examination of the provision would lead me to conclude that Parliament intended physical presence to be the test. It is difficult to see how a complete absence from Canada can count when Parliament has expressed itself so clearly by even providing for a formula in certain circumstances. If for non-permanent residents only physical presence in Canada can satisfy the formula, I would have thought that the same physical presence would have applied to permanent residents: one cannot require physical presence for one class of applicants (non-permanent residents) and not for another (permanent residents).
[12]
Actually the use of the word "shall" in the chapeau of subsection 5(1), which commands an imperative (
Interpretation Act
, RSC, 1985, c I-21, section 11), suggests that Parliament did not intend to confer a broad discretion to Citizenship Judges, as the
Papadogiorgakis
decision allows and the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, decision suggests to a lesser extent. To my way of thinking, a construction put on paragraph 5(1)(c) which would allow someone to spend barely 79 days in Canada, like in
Papadogiorgakis
,
supra
, hardly conforms to a statute that speaks in terms of "for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence".
[13]
Indeed, Reed J in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, seems to have recognized that the amendments to the Act in 1978 did not show an intent that physical presence for the whole three-year period was not required. She writes at page 292:
I have read the Parliamentary debates and committee proceedings of that period and can find nothing to substantiate that conclusion. Indeed, quite the contrary seems to be the case. The requirement of three-year residence within a four-year period seems to have been designed to allow for one year's physical absence during the four-year period. Certainly, the debates of the period suggest that physical presence in Canada for 1,095 days was contemplated as a minimum. In any event, as has been noted above, the jurisprudence which is now firmly entrenched does not require physical presence for the whole 1,095 days.
[14]
Without further analysis, Reed J leaves the issue hanging and rather concludes that the jurisprudence "is now firmly entrenched" and it "does not require physical presence for the whole 1,095 days." She then proceeds to suggest a series of questions in order to assist in the determination of "whether Canada is the country in which he or she has centralized his or her mode of existence." (page 293)
[15]
I note in passing that Reed J relies on the physical presence significantly in many of the questions that should be considered under the test she devised. Question 4 puts the issue squarely: "What is the extent of the physical absences -- if an applicant is only a few days short of the 1,095-day total it is easier to find deemed residence than if those absences are extensive?"
[16]
I find myself in general agreement with Muldoon J in
Re Pourghasemi
, [1993] 62 FTR 122, a decision which came after
Papadogiorgakis
,
supra
, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, and considered both. After commenting that
Papadogiorgakis
,
supra
, "stretches the meaning of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the present
Citizenship Act
almost beyond recognition" (para 5), Muldoon J, in his colourful way, proposes the following rationale for his reading of the section that Parliament meant an accumulation of three years of residence:
6 So those who would throw in their lot with Canadians by becoming citizens must first throw in their lot with Canadians by residing among Canadians, in Canada, during three of the preceding four years, in order to Canadianize themselves. It is not something one can do while abroad, for Canadian life and society exist only in Canada and nowhere else.
[17]
I share the view of Muldoon J that the reference in subsection 5(1) of "at least three years of residence in Canada" signals that Parliament meant physical presence. He said:
3 It is clear that the purpose of paragraph 5(1)(c) is to insure that everyone who is granted precious Canadian citizenship has become, or at least has been compulsorily presented with the everyday opportunity to become, "Canadianized".
[18]
It is not overly surprising that the debate, involving three different ways to interpret the test of residence in the Act, has remained unresolved. Now that Bill C-24,
An Act to amend the Citizenship Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts
, 2nd Sess, 41st Parl, 2014 (assented to 19 June 2014), SC 2014, c 22 (short title being
Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act
), has received Royal Assent, one hopes that the uncertainty has disappeared (see clause 3 of the
Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act
which replaces paragraph 5(1)(c)).
[19]
What is a Citizenship Judge to do in those circumstances? Justice Lutfy, before he became Chief Justice of this Court, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ruled that Citizenship Judges may apply any of the three tests. Lutfy J was followed by Pelletier J, as he then was, in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[20]
There have been some views expressed in the last few years proposing that the Court depart from the position expressed in 1999 that it is for the Citizenship Judge to decide on the approach to be chosen. As put aptly by Pelletier J, "[t]he function of the judge sitting in appeal is to verify that the Citizenship Judge has properly applied the test of his or her choosing." ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , para 9)
[21]
Starting perhaps with
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, Mainville J, as he then was, wrote:
[47] Although I am of the view that the test of physical presence for three years maintained by the first jurisprudential school is consistent with the wording of the Act, it appears to me preferable to promote a uniform approach to the interpretation and application of the statutory provision in question. I arrive at this conclusion in an attempt to standardize the applicable law. It is incongruous that the outcome of a citizenship application is determined based on analyses and tests that differ from one judge to the next. To the extent possible, coherence in administrative decision making must be fostered, as Mr. Justice Gonthier properly indicated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 327:
It is obvious that coherence in administrative decision making must be fostered. The outcome of disputes should not depend on the identity of the persons sitting on the panel for this result would be "[TRANSLATION] difficult to reconcile with the notion of equality before the law, which is one of the main corollaries of the rule of law, and perhaps also the most intelligible one": Morissette,
Le contrôle de la compétence d'attribution: thèse, antithèse and synthèse
(1986), 16
R.D.U.S
. 591, at p. 632.
[22]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Phelan J had, the year before, found that the "strict physical presence test has become of limited, if any, use and would (if it were the appropriate test) hardly require the involvement of a citizenship judge in the mathematical calculation of physical presence." (para 24) Harrington J, in
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  found that if the threshold of 1095 days of residence in Canada has not been met, the judge had to consider the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test. Similarly, Barnes J in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  expressed the view that he preferred the line of cases following <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, although he reckoned that "there will continue to be two lines of divergent authority on this issue and others may be quite properly disposed to follow Lam, above." (para 16)
[23]
Scott J, as he then was, followed the approach advocated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, in his decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There has also been some variation on that theme. Mactavish J, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  recognized that there are three approved residency tests. It would seem that the choice of tests is not as free as the
Lam
case proposes: "If the underlying rationale for the application of a particular test is not present on the facts of the case, then the application of the test simply does not make sense. That is, it is not reasonable." (para 18)
[24]
With great respect, I cannot follow this line of cases. I find it impossible to relegate what I believe is the clear language of section 5 in order to apply the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test. I would have thought that the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test is useful in cases where the applicant is very close to the 1095-day threshold and the Citizenship Judge does not want to rely on a recommendation to the executive branch of Government, in accordance with subsection 5(4) of the Act (subsection 5(4) gives discretion to the Governor in Council for citizenship to be granted without meeting the conditions precedent; the new subsection 5(4), once Bill C-24 has been proclaimed into law, grants that same discretion in the Minister.) It is ironic that the preference for the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test would be based on the need to standardize the applicable law as the uncertainty comes from judge-made-law created in spite of what, to some, would appear to be an unambiguous legislative pronouncement. Even the author of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test recognized that Parliament's intent may well be the physical presence test.
[25]
Part of the rationale for espousing the Koo test was that the uncertainty in the law was seen as becoming permanent (see
Tackla
,
supra
, at para 46). With the passage of Bill C-24, a temporary situation would appear to have been finally remedied.
[26]
I cannot find any reason to do away with the physical presence test (
Pourghasemi
,
supra
). The existence of some case law to a different effect does not change the clear wording of para 5(1)(c) of the Act(see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Chief Justice of this Court reviewed carefully our jurisprudence in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . He concluded:
[24] What is clear from the foregoing is that the jurisprudence pertaining to the test(s) for citizenship remains divided and somewhat unsettled.
[25] In this context, it is particularly appropriate that deference be accorded to a citizenship judge's decision to apply any of the three tests that have a long and rich heritage in this Court's jurisprudence.
[27]
In my view, once the Citizenship Judge has settled on the test to be applied, the role of a judge of this Court is limited to ensuring that the test has been properly applied. "Blending" is not appropriate (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[28]
The initial decision to rely on one test is however one that the Citizenship Judge could make. I share the view of Rennie J expressed at paragraph 53 of the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[53] It is my opinion that
Re Pourghasemi
is the interpretation that reflects the true meaning, intent and spirit of subsection 5(1)(c) of the Act:
Rizzo
, paras 22 and 41. For this reason it cannot be said that the Citizenship Judge erred in applying the
Re Pourghasemi
test. Furthermore, the Citizenship Judge correctly applied the
Re Pourghasemi
test in determining that a shortfall of 771 days prevented a finding that 1,095 days of physical presence in Canada had been accumulated.
[29]
As a result, the appeal must fail. There is no order as to costs.
JUDGMENT
[30]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the appeal is dismissed, without costs.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Jane Edwards, la demanderesse, interjette appel, en vertu du paragraphe 14(5) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, LRC 1985, c C-29 (la Loi), de la décision d'une juge de la citoyenneté, rendue le 3 septembre 2013, de refuser sa demande de citoyenneté canadienne.
[2]
Les faits à l'origine de cette affaire sont simples et ne sont pas contestés. La demanderesse est citoyenne britannique. Elle a immigré au Canada le 3 mars 2003. Elle est la mère d'un enfant né le 1er juin 2002. Sa fille est citoyenne britannique et canadienne. La demanderesse a acquis le statut de résidente permanente le 15 mars 2005. Elle a présenté sa demande de citoyenneté le 15 mai 2009. Vu ses absences fréquentes du Canada pour des raisons professionnelles et des raisons de vacances, la demanderesse avait accumulé 892 jours de présence physique au Canada.
[3]
L'article 5 de la Loi énonce les conditions auxquelles la citoyenneté est attribuée. C'est l'alinéa 5(1)
c
) qui nous intéresse ici:
Attribution de la citoyenneté
5. (1) Le ministre attribue la citoyenneté à toute personne qui, à la fois:
[...]
c) est un résident permanent au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
et a, dans les quatre ans qui ont précédé la date de sa demande, résidé au Canada pendant au moins trois ans en tout, la durée de sa résidence étant calculée de la manière suivante:
(i) un demi-jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada avant son admission à titre de résident permanent,
(ii) un jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada après son admission à titre de résident permanent;
Grant of citizenship
5. (1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who
...
(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:
(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and
(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;
[4]
Dans sa décision, la juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que la période à retenir pour l'examen des conditions de résidence allait du 15 mai 2005 au 15 mai 2009, date du dépôt de la demande de citoyenneté. Le statut de résidente permanente avait été acquis par la demanderesse environ deux mois avant qu'elle ne présente sa demande de citoyenneté, montrant par là un vif intérêt pour l'acquisition de la citoyenneté canadienne.
[5]
Cependant, en présentant sa demande de citoyenneté si peu de temps après être devenue résidente permanente, la demanderesse ne pouvait justifier du nombre de jours de résidence prévu par l'alinéa 5(1)
c
). Sur les 1 460 jours écoulés durant cette période, à savoir entre le 15 mai 2005 et le 15 mai 2009, il n'est pas contesté qu'il lui manquait 203 jours, puisque la Loi semble exiger au moins 1 095 jours de présence physique sur ce total de 1 460 jours. Avec 892 jours, la présence physique de la demanderesse au Canada représentait 61 p. 100 de la période de quatre ans. En fait, le déficit de 203 jours représente près de 20 p. 100 du nombre minimum de jours requis.
[6]
En l'espèce, la juge de la citoyenneté a pris note des trois critères reconnus de résidence, pour finalement retenir celui qui exige une présence physique durant 1 095 jours sur un total de 1 460 jours. Il n'y avait aucune ambiguïté dans le choix qu'elle a fait. La juge de la citoyenneté a aussi refusé expressément de faire une recommandation de dispense d'application de certaines conditions selon le paragraphe 5(3), ou d'attribution discrétionnaire de la citoyenneté au titre de circonstances particulières selon le paragraphe 5(4), après avoir conclu que rien ne justifiait une telle recommandation.
[7]
La demanderesse conteste le critère retenu par la juge de la citoyenneté, celui de la « présence physique », qui a conduit au rejet de sa demande de citoyenneté. Selon elle, l'application du critère énoncé dans la décision
Re Koo
, [1993] 1 CF 286 (la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), un autre critère possible, qui a été appliqué par certains juges dans d'autres cas, aurait produit un résultat différent compte tenu de sa situation et des raisons qu'elle avait de n'avoir pu atteindre le seuil des 1 095 jours.
[8]
Il ne sera pas nécessaire d'examiner quelle norme de contrôle devrait s'appliquer, ni de se demander si le critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> aurait ou non pu être rempli en l'espèce, car, selon moi, la juge de la citoyenneté avait le droit de se fonder sur le critère de la « présence physique », comme elle l'a fait.
[9]
La demanderesse expose avec talent les vues de certains de mes collègues qui ont regretté le fait que les juges de la citoyenneté soient à même d'appliquer une variété de critères. Certains sont donc arrivés à la conclusion que le critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> devrait l'emporter. Malheureusement, je ne partage pas cette opinion.
[10]
En dépit du fait que, pour beaucoup, l'intention du législateur est qu'un candidat à la citoyenneté doit justifier d'une présence physique, le juge en chef adjoint Thurlow écrivait, dans la décision
Re Papadogiorgakis
, [1978] 2 CF 208 (la décision
Papadogiorgakis
), qu'il serait possible de considérer une autre période de temps, étant donné que le mot « résidence » n'est pas défini dans la Loi. La résidence ne requiert pas une présence physique si l'intéressé a centralisé son mode de vie quelque part au Canada.
[11]
J'incline à penser que l'intention du législateur peut assez aisément être déchiffrée. Je trouve difficile d'admettre qu'une résidence présumée est possible lorsqu'est accordé à un résident non permanent, au moyen d'une formule, un demi-jour de résidence pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada. À coup sûr, l'intention du législateur est que le résident non permanent doit résider au Canada pour que cette résidence puisse compter pour moitié pour les besoins de l'attribution de la citoyenneté. Conclure autrement conduirait à une absurdité: un résident non permanent pourrait se voir reconnaître un demi-jour de résidence tout en résidant en dehors du pays. L'interprétation téléologique de la disposition me conduirait à conclure que le législateur voulait que la présence physique serve de critère. Il est difficile de voir comment une absence complète du Canada pourrait compter quand le législateur s'est exprimé aussi clairement, allant même jusqu'à énoncer une formule dans certains cas. Si, pour les résidents non permanents, seule la présence physique au Canada peut satisfaire à la formule, alors j'incline à penser que la même présence physique s'applique aux résidents permanents: on ne saurait exiger la présence physique pour une catégorie de candidats (les résidents non permanents) et non pour une autre (les résidents permanents).
[12]
En réalité, l'emploi du présent de l'indicatif du verbe « attribuer », dans les mots introductifs du paragraphe 5(1), un temps de verbe qui exprime une obligation (
Loi d'interprétation
, LRC 1985, c I-21, article 11), donne à penser que le législateur n'entendait pas conférer un large pouvoir discrétionnaire aux juges de la citoyenneté, contrairement à ce que semble admettre la décision
Papadogiorgakis
, et à ce que donne à penser, dans une moindre mesure, la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . À mon avis, une interprétation de l'alinéa 5(1)
c
) qui autoriserait une personne à passer à peine 79 jours au Canada, comme dans l'affaire
Papadogiorgakis
, ne cadre pas précisément avec un texte législatif qui établit explicitement la durée de la résidence de la manière suivante: « un demi-jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada avant son admission à titre de résident permanent ».
[13]
Du reste, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la juge Reed semble avoir reconnu que les modifications apportées à la Loi en 1978 ne signalaient pas une intention du législateur selon laquelle une présence physique durant la période totale de trois ans n'était pas requise. Elle s'exprime ainsi, à la page 292:
J'ai lu les débats parlementaires et les délibérations des comités de l'époque et je n'y vois rien qui justifie une telle conclusion. En fait, il semble que ce soit tout le contraire. La condition de trois ans de résidence dans une période de quatre ans semble avoir été conçue pour permettre une absence physique d'une durée d'un an pendant les quatre ans prescrits. Certes, les débats tenus à l'époque donnent à penser que l'on envisageait comme durée minimale une présence physique au Canada de 1 095 jours. Quoi qu'il en soit, comme je l'ai signalé plus tôt, la jurisprudence qui est aujourd'hui fermement établie n'exige pas que la personne en question soit physiquement présente pendant toute la période de 1 095 jours.
[14]
Sans autre analyse, la juge Reed laisse la question en suspens pour plutôt conclure que la jurisprudence « est aujourd'hui fermement établie » et qu'elle « n'exige pas que la personne en question soit physiquement présente pendant toute la période de 1 095 jours ». Elle propose ensuite une série de questions censées permettre de déterminer si le Canada est « le pays où le requérant a centralisé son mode d'existence » (page 293).
[15]
J'observe en passant que la juge Reed se fonde pour une large part sur la présence physique dans bon nombre des questions qui devraient être examinées selon le critère qu'elle proposait. La question 4 pose le problème sans détour: « Quelle est l'étendue des absences physiques (lorsqu'il ne manque à un requérant que quelques jours pour atteindre le nombre total de 1 095 jours, il est plus facile de conclure à une résidence réputée que lorsque les absences en question sont considérables)? »
[16]
Je souscris pour l'essentiel aux observations formulées par le juge Muldoon dans la décision
Re Pourghasemi
, [1993] 62 FTR 122, une décision qui était postérieure à la décision
Papadogiorgakis
, précitée, et à la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, et qui passait en revue ces deux précédents. Affirmant d'abord que la décision
Papadogiorgakis
, précitée, « a forcé le sens de l'alinéa 5(1)
c
) de l'actuelle loi sur la citoyenneté au point de le rendre presque méconnaissable » (paragraphe 5), le juge Muldoon propose, dans le langage coloré qui le caractérise, le raisonnement suivant pour appuyer l'interprétation qu'il donne de cette disposition, à savoir que, selon lui, le législateur voulait que soient accumulés trois ans de résidence:
6 Ainsi, ceux qui entendent partager volontairement le sort des Canadiens en devenant citoyens du pays doivent le faire en vivant parmi les Canadiens, au Canada, durant trois des quatre années précédant la demande, afin de se canadianiser. Ce n'est pas quelque chose que l'on peut faire à l'étranger, car la vie canadienne et la société canadienne n'existent qu'au Canada, nulle part ailleurs
[17]
Je partage l'opinion du juge Muldoon selon laquelle la mention au paragraphe 5(1) d'« au moins trois ans [de résidence au Canada] en tout » montre que le législateur entendait par là une présence physique. Il a fait observer ce qui suit:
3 Il est évident que l'alinéa 5(1)
c
) vise à garantir que quiconque aspire au don précieux de la citoyenneté canadienne ait acquis, ou se soit vu obligé d'acquérir, au préalable la possibilité quotidienne de « se canadianiser ».
[18]
Il n'est guère surprenant que le débat, qui porte sur trois manières différentes d'interpréter le critère de résidence dont parle la Loi, soit demeuré non résolu. Maintenant que le projet de loi C-24,
Loi modifiant la Loi sur la citoyenneté et d'autres lois en conséquence
, 2e session, 41e législature, 2014 (sanctionnée le 19 juin 2014), LC 2014, c 22 (titre abrégé:
Loi renforçant la citoyenneté canadienne
), a reçu la sanction royale, espérons que l'incertitude s'est dissipée (voir l'article 3 de la
Loi renforçant la citoyenneté canadienne
, qui remplace l'alinéa 5(1)
c
)).
[19]
Que doit faire un juge de la citoyenneté dans ces conditions? Avant de devenir juge en chef de la Cour, le juge Lutfy avait estimé, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , que les juges de la citoyenneté pouvaient appliquer n'importe lequel des trois critères. Il fut suivi en cela par le juge Pelletier, tel était alors son titre, dans la décision
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
Au cours des années récentes, plusieurs points de vue ont été exprimés, où l'on propose que la Cour s'écarte de la position énoncée en 1999 selon laquelle c'est au juge de la citoyenneté qu'il appartient de choisir le critère à appliquer. Comme l'écrivait avec à propos le juge Pelletier, « [l]e rôle du juge qui entend l'appel consiste à vérifier si le juge de la citoyenneté a correctement appliqué le critère qu'il a choisi » (décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 9).
[21]
Avec sans doute pour point de départ la décision
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur qui devrait être appliqué, une certaine jurisprudence s'est développée, suivant laquelle le critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> doit être privilégié. Ce point de vue a pris corps dans la décision
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Le juge Mainville, tel était alors son titre, a écrit ce qui suit:
[47] Quoique je sois d'avis que le critère de la présence physique pendant trois ans soutenu par la première école jurisprudentielle est conforme au texte de la loi, il m'apparaît préférable de favoriser une approche uniforme à l'interprétation et à l'application de la disposition législative en cause. J'arrive à cette conclusion dans un effort d'uniformisation du droit applicable. En effet, il n'est pas cohérent que le sort d'une demande de citoyenneté soit déterminé selon des grilles d'analyse et des critères qui divergent d'un juge à un autre. Dans la mesure du possible, il faut favoriser la cohérence des décisions des tribunaux administratifs, comme le signalait à juste titre le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 327:
Il est évident qu'il faut favoriser la cohérence des décisions rendues en matière administrative. L'issue des litiges ne devrait pas dépendre de l'identité des personnes qui composent le banc puisque ce résultat serait « difficile à concilier avec la notion d'égalité devant la loi, l'un des principaux corollaires de la primauté du droit, et peut-être aussi le plus intelligible »: Morissette, Le contrôle de la compétence d'attribution: thèse, antithèse et synthèse (1986), 16 R.D.U.S. 591, à la p. 632.
[22]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Phelan avait estimé, l'année précédente, que « [l]a condition d'une présence strictement physique n'a plus beaucoup d'utilité, si elle en a encore une, et elle n'exigerait pas vraiment (si elle était la condition appropriée) l'intervention du juge de la citoyenneté dans le calcul mathématique de la période de présence physique » (paragraphe 24). Dans la décision
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Harrington a conclu que, si le seuil de 1 095 jours de résidence au Canada n'était pas atteint, alors le juge devait appliquer le critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Pareillement, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Barnes affirmait pencher pour la jurisprudence suivant la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, encore qu'il eût admis qu'« il y aura toujours deux courants jurisprudentiels divergents sur cette question et d'autres seront à juste titre disposés à suivre
Lam
, précitée » (paragraphe 16).
[23]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Scott, tel était alors son titre, a suivi l'approche préconisée dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. Il y a aussi eu des fluctuations sur ce thème. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Mactavish a reconnu qu'il existait trois critères officiels de résidence. Il semblerait que le choix de tel ou tel critère n'est pas aussi libre que le donne à penser la décision
Lam
: « Si la raison d'être de l'application d'un critère en particulier n'est pas présente dans les faits de l'affaire, alors l'appliquer n'a simplement aucun sens. Autrement dit, c'est déraisonnable » (paragraphe 18).
[24]
L'on me permettra de m'écarter de cette jurisprudence. Je crois qu'il est impossible de faire abstraction de ce qui me semble être le libellé très clair de l'article 5 pour appliquer le critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . À mon avis, le critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> est utile dans les cas où le demandeur a presque atteint le seuil de 1 095 jours et où le juge de la citoyenneté se refuse à présenter une recommandation à l'exécutif selon le paragraphe 5(4) de la Loi (le paragraphe 5(4) confère au gouverneur en conseil le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'ordonner au ministre d'attribuer la citoyenneté sans que soient remplies les conditions préalables; le nouveau paragraphe 5(4), une fois le projet de loi C-24 entré en vigueur, confère le même pouvoir discrétionnaire au ministre.) Il est ironique de constater que la préférence accordée au critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> procède de la nécessité d'uniformiser le droit applicable quand l'incertitude découle d'une jurisprudence qui s'est formée en dépit de ce qui semblerait à certains être une déclaration on ne peut plus clair du législateur. L'initiateur lui-même du critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> reconnaissait que l'intention du législateur pouvait bien être le critère de la présence physique.
[25]
La préférence pour le critère de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s'expliquait en partie par le fait que l'incertitude juridique était vue comme une situation devenue permanente (voir la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 46). Avec l'adoption du projet de loi C-24, une situation temporaire semblerait avoir été finalement corrigée.
[26]
Je ne vois aucune raison d'écarter le critère de la présence physique (décision
Pourghasemi
, précitée). L'existence d'une jurisprudence contraire ne modifie en rien le libellé précis de l'alinéa 5(1)
c
) de la Loi (voir aussi la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le juge en chef de la Cour, après examen approfondi de notre jurisprudence, a conclu ce qui suit dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[23] Il ressort de ce qui précède que la jurisprudence relative au(x) critère(s) de la citoyenneté demeure partagée et plutôt flottante.
[24] Dans ces conditions, il convient tout particulièrement de faire preuve de déférence envers la décision du juge de la citoyenneté d'appliquer l'un ou l'autre des trois critères qui sont reconnus depuis si longtemps dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour.
[27]
À mon avis, une fois que le choix du juge de la citoyenneté s'est fixé sur le critère à appliquer, un juge de la Cour doit se limiter à s'assurer que le critère a été correctement appliqué. Il faut se garder de « fusionner » les critères (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[28]
La décision initiale de s'en remettre à un critère en particulier est toutefois une décision que la juge de la citoyenneté pouvait prendre. Je partage l'avis exprimé par le juge Rennie au paragraphe 53 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[53] J'estime que l'interprétation faite dans Pourghasemi est celle qui est conforme au sens, à l'objet et à l'esprit véritables de l'alinéa 5(1)c) de la Loi (Rizzo, paragraphes 22 et 41). On ne peut donc dire que le juge de la citoyenneté a commis une erreur en appliquant le critère énoncé dans Pourghasemi. Le juge de la citoyenneté a en outre correctement appliqué ce critère en statuant qu'une absence de 771 jours empêchait de conclure qu'il y avait eu une présence physique de 1 095 jours en tout au Canada.
[29]
Pour ces motifs, l'appel est rejeté. Aucuns dépens ne sont adjugés.
