Introduction
[1]
Noël, J.
: This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], of a decision by Lina Ly, a Citizenship and Immigration Canada Officer [CIC Officer], dated February 15, 2013, denying the Applicants' request for permanent residency based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations [H&C Application] under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA.
II.
Facts
[2]
Fito Alcin [Principal Applicant] and his wife Rosianie Alcime are Haitien citizens and have three children who are American citizens, Frisnel Alcin, born on June 6, 2002, Najika Alcin, born on July 17, 2003, and Owenslay Alcin, born on June 16, 2005 [together, the Applicants].
[3]
The Principal Applicant and his wife fled Haiti in 2002 for the United States of America [US] where their children were born.
[4]
The Applicants arrived in Canada on July 2, 2008 and claimed refugee status, which was denied on June 25, 2010.
[5]
The Applicants submitted their H&C Application on October 25, 2010.
[6]
The Applicants are the subject of a removal order, but a Temporary Suspension of Removals [TSR] for Haiti is in effect in Canada until further notice.
III.
Decision under review
[7]
The CIC Officer was satisfied as to the identity and citizenship of each Applicant.
[8]
At the outset of the decision, the CIC Officer described the exceptional nature of the H&C Application and stated that the onus was on the Applicants to demonstrate that they would suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they were to present their Application for permanent residence in the normal manner, meaning from outside Canada.
[9]
The present H&C Application was based on three grounds, namely the degree of establishment in Canada, the best interest of the children and conditions in the country of origin. These grounds, either taken individually or taken together, do not justify an exemption for humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
[10]
First, regarding the level of establishment in Canada, the CIC Officer examined the Principal Applicant's and his wife's employment status and history, both in Canada and in the US, and found that they did not adequately show why they would not be able to find work should they return in Haiti, given the experience they both possess. Moreover, they failed to demonstrate their financial independence and the way in which losing their employment here as a result of having to present their permanent residence application from outside Canada would lead to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
[11]
The CIC Officer also considered other arguments put forward by the Applicants with respect to their establishment in Canada, specifically the poor employment prospects in Haiti and the fact that the Applicants financially support family members in Haiti who have suffered the devastations of the 2010 earthquake. Nevertheless, the CIC Officer noted that a TSR is in effect as a result of the current instability across Haiti, which means that the Applicants could remain and work in Canada, for the time being, and continue to support their family until the TSR is lifted. Ultimately, the CIC Officer found that the Applicants failed to sufficiently show the adequate level of establishment and integration in Canada and the way in which severing ties with Canada would result in unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship should they be required to present their permanent residence application from outside Canada.
[12]
Second, the CIC Officer examined the issue of the best interest of the children and started by noting that all three children are American citizens. The CIC Officer reviewed a letter from the organization
La Maisonnée, services d'aide et de liaison pour immigrants
, which highlighted the difficult situation in Haiti and asserted the children's establishment in Canada. Noting that this letter was the only piece of evidence produced with respect to the best interest of the children, the CIC Officer came to the conclusion that the Applicants, who had the onus of providing sufficient evidence, failed to show that their children are well established and integrated in Canada.
[13]
The CIC Officer also found that the family unit would not be compromised if the Applicants are to return to Haiti to present their permanent residence application. The Applicants having failed to prove that they would not be in a position to work in their country of origin, the CIC Officer found that they also failed to show that their children could not adapt well and would be deprived of the emotional, physical and material support of their parents in Haiti. The CIC Officer also noted that despite the onus bearing on them, the Applicants did not provide any piece of documentary evidence pertaining to their allegation that the education system in Haiti is of a lesser quality. That being said, the CIC Officer consulted public and objective documentation related to the current difficult situation of the Haitian educational system but still found that, until the TSR for Haiti is lifted, the Applicants could remain in Canada and the children could still benefit from the Canadian education system. While she declared herself receptive and alert to the best interest of the child, the CIC Officer maintained that this factor is not more important than the other interests in a way that it entails a
prima facie
presumption that it should always prevail. The Applicants simply did not put forward sufficient evidence in support of their claims.
[14]
Third, as for the conditions in the country of origins, the CIC Officer reminded that according to new legislation the Minister "may not consider the factors that are taken into account in the determination of whether a person is a Convention refugee under section 96 or a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) but must consider elements related to the hardships that affect the foreign national."
[15]
According to the CIC Officer, the Applicants did not provide any objective documentary evidence as to the generally difficult conditions in their country of origin except for a number of unsigned letters from members of their family. The CIC Officer nonetheless took it upon herself to examine public and objective evidence and acknowledged that the situation in Haiti is indeed difficult especially after the 2010 earthquake. She noted, however, that this difficult situation and these precarious living conditions affect the entire Haitian population and not only the Applicants. The CIC Officer referred to the TSR in effect for Haiti, added that this measure is a direct result of a generalized risk and not of a personalized risk, and noted that notwithstanding the TSR, the Applicants had failed to discharge the burden of proving that, in their particular situation, they would suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they were to present their Application for permanent residence from outside Canada once the TSR is lifted.
[16]
The CIC Officer concluded by stating the Applicants, who still benefit from the TSR, could continue their integration in Canada and eventually submit another H&C Application.
IV.
Applicants' submissions
[17]
The Applicants argue that the CIC Officer wrongly concluded that they were exposed to a generalized risk in Haiti and that this determination vitiated the rest of the decision. They submit three principal arguments: (1) the CIC Officer made a reviewable error in her appreciation of the unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship when she concluded that the current situation in Haiti constituted a generalized risk as opposed to a personalized risk, (2) the CIC Officer wrongfully relied her reasoning on the existence of a TSR for Haiti, and (3) the CIC Officer minimized the best interest of the children.
[18]
The Applicants first put forward the argument that the CIC Officer made a reviewable error in her appreciation of the unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship when she concluded that the current situation in Haiti amounted to a generalized risk. Indeed, they claim that, in doing so, the CIC Officer misapprehended the applicable criteria and applied a standard that was too strict - the Applicants were expected to prove being exposed to a personalized risk. This Court has recently granted an application for judicial review, finding that the officer committed an error when it based its analysis on the risk and not the prejudice. Also, as confirmed by this Court on numerous occasions, the reasons should have concentrated on the unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship suffered by the Applicants and not on the future risks, which are applicable to a refugee claim or a pre-removal risk assessment.
[19]
What is more, the CIC Officer refers to a decision rendered prior to the coming into force of the new legislation which rejected sections 96 and 97 from the determination of an H&C Application. Under this new legislative regime, the
IP 5 - Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds
guide [IP 5 Guide] was amended to explicitly command CIC Officers to steer away from the criteria applicable under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA and to concentrate on the "hardships that affect the foreign national," including "adverse country conditions that have a direct negative impact on the applicant." To the contrary of this direction, however, the CIC Officer in the case at bar applied the criteria which would fall under section 97, when she stated that the current situation in Haiti affected the entire population and therefore constituted a generalized risk and not a personalized risk. However, the Applicants had submitted evidence of the "direct negative impact" suffered, and the CIC Officer herself identified in documentary evidence several elements that show adverse conditions in the general situation in Haiti.
[20]
As a second argument, the Applicants claim that the CIC Officer wrongfully relied her reasoning on the existence of a TSR for Haiti. While it is true that the existence of a TSR for a specific country would not justify a positive outcome for every H&C Application submitted with regard to this country, it most certainly cannot lead systematically to a negative outcome. According to the previously cited IP 5 Guide, the presence of a TSR can be taken into consideration in appreciating the establishment of an applicant in Canada. On many occasions in the present case, however, the CIC Officer simply filled the gaps in her analysis by stating that, regardless of the outcome of her decision, the Applicants would remain in Canada.
[21]
The third and last argument brought forth by the Applicants relates to the CIC Officer's appreciation of the best interest of the children. They submit that the CIC Officer minimized the existing evidence in this regard. According to case law and the IP 5 Guide, officers must "always be alert and sensitive to the interests of children." In the present case, the CIC Officer concluded to the absence of proof regarding the children's integration in Canada after rejecting the letter from the organization
La Maisonnée, service d'aide et de liaison pour les immigrants
, but she failed to explain why she rejected this letter. Furthermore, the CIC Officer never addressed the fact that the children are American citizens and have no relation with Haiti. However, the Applicants argue having submitted in their affidavit a series of elements which indicate that the children are in a far better position in Canada than they would ever be in Haiti.
[22]
Moreover, although the Applicants did not present a vast amount of evidence, the CIC Officer nevertheless examined the documentation and recognized the existence of adverse conditions in this country as it concerns the children but stated that the presence of a TSR somewhat protected the Applicants. Once again, the CIC Officer filled the gaps in her analysis by relying on the existence of the TSR. Lastly, the Applicants submit that the CIC Officer's process for the analysis of the best interest of the children failed to follow recent teachings of this Court.
[23]
Therefore, because the CIC Officer applied the incorrect criteria in her appreciation of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate, afforded too much importance to the existence of a TSR for Haiti and minimized the best interest of the children, the CIC Officer's decision cannot stand.
V.
Respondent's submissions
[24]
The Respondent argues that the CIC Officer's decision was reasonable and should be upheld, mainly because the Officer based her decision on the fact that the Applicants failed to provide sufficient objective evidence and because the decision is highly discretionary and results from a purely factual assessment of the case.
[25]
First, the Respondent claims that the CIC Officer did not make a reviewable error in her appreciation of the unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship by concluding that the current situation in Haiti constituted a generalized risk as opposed to a personalized risk. As a matter of fact, the Applicants submitted no objective evidence on the current situation in the country and practically no allegations of their possible future situation in Haiti, and although the CIC Officer indeed stated that the Applicants would be in the same situation as the rest of the Haitian population, she clearly articulated that they did not demonstrate how this situation would lead to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship for them. This burden was on the Applicants. The Principal Applicant did produce an affidavit describing the difficulties which his family would face in Haiti, but this affidavit was not before the CIC Officer and the information therein should not be considered for the purposes of this judicial review.
[26]
Moreover, on the issue of the current situation in Haiti, the Respondent claims that the general difficult situation across Haiti does not suffice to issue an exemption under humanitarian grounds.
[27]
Second, with regard to the Applicants' argument that the CIC Officer wrongfully relied on the existence of a TSR for Haiti, the Respondent reminds this Court that a TSR does not automatically warrant a successful H&C Application. Although the Officer did consider the fact that the Applicants will remain in Canada until this TSR is lifted, this element in no way constituted the basis for the decision, it was merely an additional comment, as the CIC Officer's decision is based on the fact the Applicants failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of their claims.
[28]
What is more, with respect to the Applicants' establishment in Canada, the CIC Officer considered the circumstances of the case and found that the Applicants' establishment in Canada did not constitute a sufficient ground. This decision was reasonable, as the Applicants had the onus of establishing their claims and failed to do so. The Respondent further submits that the issue of integration in Canada alone is not sufficient to prove the unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship that a party could suffer if they were required to present the permanent residence application from outside Canada.
[29]
Third, as for the superior interest of the children, the Applicants once again simply did not produce sufficient documentary evidence related, in particular, to the children's integration in Canada, to the reasons why they could not benefit from their parents' support in Haiti, and to their allegations that the children could not prevail themselves from a similar quality of education as they do in Canada. They presented practically no evidence that the children's best interest would be compromised should they relocate to Haiti. In fact, the CIC Officer considered the little evidence submitted by the Applicants - and explicitly acknowledged the letter in question from
La Maisonnée, services d'aide et de liaison pour immigrants
- and once more took it upon herself to examine the general documentation. Ultimately, she reasonably concluded that the best interest of the children did not warrant an exemption under humanitarian grounds. In no way did the CIC Officer minimize the best interest of the children: the appreciation of this issue is to be conducted in the more general consideration of whether, in regard to all circumstances, including the best interest of the children, the Applicants would suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship were they to present their Application for permanent residence from outside Canada.
[30]
The Respondent also submits that the Applicants ask this Court to reexamine the evidence that was before the CIC Officer with respect to the best interest of the children because they are not satisfied with the decision she reasonably took. However, the appreciation of the evidence was the task of the CIC Officer and not that of the Court.
VI.
Applicants' reply
[31]
In their reply, the Applicants answer to the Respondent's arguments by referring to specific paragraphs of their original submissions, and thus submit no other argument.
[32]
They do, however, encourage this Court to consider new case law which further clarifies the nature of hardship suffered and the importance of resorting to an analysis of hardship rather than an assessment of personalized risk for the purposes of an H&C Application.
VII.
Issues
[33]
The case at bar raises the following two issues:
1. Did the CIC Officer apply the proper legal criteria under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA as it relates to the appreciation of the current situation in Haiti for the determination of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship?
2. Did the CIC Officer adequately assess the H&C considerations under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA, in particular as it relates to the appreciation of the current situation in Haiti for the determination of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship, to the mentioning of the TSR in effect for Haiti and to the consideration of the best interest of the children?
VIII.
Standard of review
[34]
The Supreme Court of Canada set out at para 62 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] SCJ No 9 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] a two-step standard of review analysis in order to determine the applicable standard for a particular case. The first step of this analysis is to "ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question."
[35]
With respect to the first issue, on the applicable legal criteria, Justice Gleason, of this Court, has recently stated "that the correctness standard is applicable to review the officer's enunciation of the test to be employed when determining whether H&C consideration is warranted." (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada established that the standard of review applicable to judicial reviews of H&C Application is reasonableness. This standard of review has been confirmed post- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] FCJ No 713 and followed in more recent decisions emanating from this Court (see, for example
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 259;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1005).
[37]
Therefore, on this second issue, this Court must consider "whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47) and shall afford great deference to the decision of the CIC Officer (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] SCJ No 3).
IX.
Analysis
A.
Did the CIC Officer apply the proper legal criteria under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA as it relates to the appreciation of the current situation in Haiti for the determination of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship?
[38]
This first issue deals with identifying the criteria which the CIC Officer applied in determining H&C considerations under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA in the present matter. Did she consider the factors taken into consideration in the determination of applications under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA? Or did she examine the elements related to the hardships that affect the foreign national?
[39]
The Applicants argue the CIC Officer made an error in her appreciation of the unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship in the current circumstances in Haiti, when she concluded that the situation in Haiti amounted to a generalized risk, which would fall under the factors considered pursuant to section 97. However, I find that the CIC Officer applied the proper criteria, namely the one related to the hardships, and thus this Court's intervention is not warranted on this issue.
[40]
At the outset, I must acknowledge that the Applicants' factual arguments are somewhat valid in that the CIC Officer indeed referred on a number of occasions to the general situation in Haiti and found that they would not be in conditions different from that of the entire Haitian population. As rightfully submitted by the Applicants and duly noted by the CIC Officer in her decision, following the amendment of subsection 25(1.3) of the IRPA by the
Balanced Refugee Reform Act
, SC 2010, c 8, the evidence submitted  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Applications is no longer to be examined in the light of the factors pertinent to applications presented under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, which would include the generalized versus personalized risk factor relevant under section 97 (see for example
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 1291).
[41]
This amendment was reflected in the IP 5 Guide which now states that "[...] [w]hile A96 and A97 factors may not be considered, the decision-maker must take into account elements related to the hardships that affect the foreign national," which may include "adverse country conditions that have a direct negative impact on the applicant." In this regard, the CIC Officer's conduct shows that she considered the 96 and 97 factors as well as the newly established criteria stated in the IP Guide 5, i.e. the hardship suffered by the Applicants should they return. However, when reading the decision as a whole, I find that the CIC Officer effectively applied the proper legal criteria. In addition, but also more importantly, there was clearly a lack of evidence presented by the Applicants even though they bore the burden to do so. All in all, there may have been an appearance of confusion in applying the proper legal criteria but, in the end, when considering the decision in its entirety the proper legal test was applied.
B
. Did the CIC Officer adequately assess the H&C considerations under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA, in particular as it relates to the appreciation of the current situation in Haiti for the determination of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship, to the mentioning of the TSR in effect for Haiti and to the consideration of the best interest of the children?
[42]
This Court finds that the decision rendered by the CIC Officer, albeit imperfect, is still reasonable, mainly because the Applicants failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of their claims.
[43]
Indeed, with regard to all three factors, I find that the Applicants are merely asking this Court to re-weigh what little evidence they had presented to the CIC Officer in their H&C Application. However, the appreciation and weighing of this evidence is the responsibility of the decision-maker and not of this Court, as this Court stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 1670:
[7] It is well established that the decision made by a ministerial delegate to accept an H&C application is an exceptional and discretionary decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Furthermore, the ministerial delegate deciding the H&C application has the responsibility of assessing the evidence and assigning it the proper weight: this is not the reviewing Court's role ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Applications, the Applicants have the burden of providing evidence in support of their claims:
[5] [...] Moreover, an applicant has the burden of adducing proof of any claim on which the H & C application relies. Hence, if an applicant provides no evidence to support the claim, the officer may conclude that it is baseless. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2004] FCJ No 158 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
As a matter of fact, the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated this statement in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] FCJ No 713 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], by finding that "[i]t cannot be disputed that the appellants had the burden of proving the claims made in their H&C application." As a result, at all times, the Applicants must prove that they would suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship should they have to present their Application for permanent residence from outside Canada.
[45]
For the reasons set out below, this Court finds that, independently of the analysis she undertook for each claim, the CIC Officer primarily rejected the Applicants' H&C Application because they failed to discharge their evidentiary burden, thus rendering the decision under review reasonable.
1.
The Current Situation in Haiti
[46]
As previously stated, although the CIC Officer does refer to the fact that the Applicants would be in the same difficult situation as the rest of the Haitian population, I find that she did not base her refusal solely on this reasoning. This Court finds the CIC Officer had first and foremost rejected the H&C Application because the Applicants failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of their claims. As a matter of fact, they provided very little to the CIC Officer with which to work: their H&C Application only contained allegations which were supported by unsigned letters from family members or acquaintances living in Haiti. They provided absolutely no objective documentary evidence reflecting the difficulties they would face in Haiti, or as the CIC Officer put it "[translation] the Applicants, however, submitted no objective documentary evidence related to the general situation in Haiti." The little evidence produced by the Applicants was actually assessed and addressed by the CIC Officer in the decision as not being sufficient, and this was enough to reject the H&C Application because the burden was on the Applicants. It is not up to this Court to re-weigh this evidence.
[47]
What is more, after concluding that she had been presented with no evidence that could help the Applicants, the CIC Officer took it upon herself to examine public and objective documentary evidence, even though she did not have to do it. Had she not done so, the CIC Officer would have had nothing to examine regarding the general situation in Haiti and, considering her above-quoted finding, the H&C Application would surely have been rejected simply because the Applicants provided practically no evidence to back their submissions. Whether this evidence was interpreted in the light of personalized risk for the Applicants or a generalized risk for the entire population in Haiti matters very little - given that the Applicants presented virtually no evidence on the issue of the current situation in Haiti and that this was enough to reject their Application, the CIC Officer surely cannot be faulted for her appreciation of the evidence she had to adduce herself!
[48]
Building on this reasonable finding and considering the undeniable lack of evidence in the present matter with regard to the current situation in Haiti, sending the matter back to the CIC Officer on this issue alone would be a moot exercise.
[49]
Therefore, despite the fact that the CIC Officer's decision is not perfect, this Court finds that the CIC Officer did not commit a reviewable error in her appreciation of the unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship that would be suffered by the Applicants, as the Applicants did not submit any objective evidence of such difficulties despite having the burden of convincing the CIC Officer as to the merits of their claims.
2.
The Best Interest of the Children
[50]
As for the Applicants' argument that the CIC Officer minimized the best interest of the children, this Court's reasoning will greatly resemble that which it applied to the Applicants' first argument.
[51]
Here again, the Applicants simply failed to provide sufficient evidence. In fact, they provided one letter from the organization
La Maisonnée, services d'aide et de liaison pour immigrants
, which the CIC Officer considered and explicitly acknowledged in her decision but reasonably found to be insufficient proof of the children's integration in Canada. As mentioned earlier, the Applicants had the burden of producing sufficient evidence in support of their claims. On a number of occasions, the CIC Officer indicates that they did not submit any sufficient evidence that shows the difficult situation which the children could face in Haiti and the fact that the children could not benefit from the emotional, physical and material support of their parents in Haiti.
[52]
Once again, confronted with a great lack of evidence, the CIC Officer decided on her own initiative to examine public and objective documents related to the situation of children in the country. Just as it was the case for the Applicants' first argument, as stated above, this lack of evidence would have been sufficient to reject the H&C Application because, had she not examined further documents, she would have had practically nothing to assess the best interest of the children.
[53]
However, the CIC Officer did somewhat assess the best interest of the children, and as mentioned earlier, she cannot be faulted for her appreciation of the evidence she herself put forward as a result of the Applicants' failure to do so. Given that the Applicants provided virtually no evidence in support of their claims, the only way she could possibly have considered the best interest of the children was through the examination of documentary evidence which she adduced on her own initiative. Thus, this argument does not warrant this Court's intervention.
3.
The Mention of the TSR in Effect in Haiti
[54]
Lastly, the Applicants argue that the CIC Officer wrongfully relied her reasoning on the existence of a TSR for Haiti in order to fill the various gaps in her decision. I find that this argument does not warrant the intervention of this Court.
[55]
For greater clarification, I shall start by specifying that a Temporary Suspension of Removals is a governmental measure that is symptomatic of a generalized risk for the population in a specific country and that, in the context of an H&C Application, the existence of a TSR with regard to a specific country cannot automatically lead to specific outcome, whether positive or negative. As such, the fact that a TSR is in effect in Haiti did not preclude the CIC Officer from rejecting the H&C Application (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2007] FCJ No 449).
[56]
Similar to the conclusion for the Applicants' first argument, this Court finds that the CIC Officer did not base her reasoning solely on the TSR but primarily on the fact that the Applicants had not provided sufficient evidence in support of all their claims. As previously stated, the Applicants had the burden of proving that they would suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they were to present their Application for permanent residence from outside Canada.
[57]
This Court has already concluded that the Applicants have in fact failed to produce sufficient evidence with regard to the current situation in Haiti and the best interest of children, which leaves only the analysis of the evidence presented regarding the other claim in the H&C Application: the Applicants' establishment in Canada.
[58]
The Applicants claim that the CIC Officer relies on the existence of a TSR in Haiti in order to fill the gaps in her analysis of their establishment in Canada and the superior interest of the children. In her analysis of the Applicants' establishment in Canada, the CIC Officer considered the little evidence submitted by the Applicants, and this appreciation of the evidence lies within her expertise and jurisdiction. She took into account their employment history and added that they had "[translation] submitted no further documents attesting to their financial independence." The Applicants further claimed that the employment situation is difficult in Haiti, but as mentioned above, the Applicants submitted no objective evidence related to the conditions in the country. The Applicants also put forward the argument that they provide financial support to family members in Haiti, but they did not produce documentary evidence to prove it, such as a bank deposit slip.
[59]
What is more, after considering and weighing the evidence, the CIC Officer reasonably concluded that the Applicants' establishment in Canada is not a sufficient ground to grant an H&C Application, as this Court stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] FCJ No 795:
[43] According to the jurisprudence, the degree of establishment in Canada is not decisive on an application based on H&C considerations. Similarly, the hardship inherent in being required to leave after having spent several years in Canada is normally not sufficient to warrant an exception. Again, s. 25 of the IRPA is intended to provide an exceptional relief for unusual, undeserved and disproportionate hardship (Singh, above at paras. 51-52; Wazid, above at paras. 14-16;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 556 at paras. 18-20;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 161 at para. 2;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 111 at paras. 9-10 and 36-40).
[60]
As previously stated, it is not the role of this Court to re-weigh the evidence considered by the CIC Officer.
[61]
As such, although the CIC Officer did mention on numerous occasions that the Applicants, adults as well as children, could remain in Canada as a result of the TSR in effect for Haiti and therefore continue benefiting from the advantages of living in Canada, this Court finds that these mentions of the TSR are simple remarks on behalf of the CIC Officer, which does not make them objectionable. As stated earlier, they were not used to decide on the outcome. Rather, the lack of evidence was the determinant factor.
4.
Conclusion
[62]
All in all, I find that as rightly noted by the CIC Officer, the Applicants failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of their claims despite having the burden of proving that they would suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship should they present their Application for permanent residence from outside Canada. I also find that the CIC Officer reasonably appreciated the little evidence with which she was presented and even went further than what was expected of her by seeking public and objective documentation on her own initiative. Although the decision under review is far from flawless, considering that the absolute lack of evidence submitted by the Applicants is sufficient to reject the H&C Application, the CIC Officer's decision undeniably falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law and must therefore be upheld.

The parties were invited to submit questions for certification but none were proposed.

Les demandeurs sont arrivés au Canada le 2 juillet 2008 et ont présenté une demande d'asile qui a été rejetée le 25 juin 2010.
[5]
Le 25 octobre 2010, les demandeurs ont présenté leur demande CH.
[6]
Les demandeurs font l'objet d'une mesure de renvoi, mais une suspension temporaire des renvois (la STR) vers Haïti est en vigueur au Canada jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
III.
Décision soumise au contrôle
[7]
L'agente de CIC a été convaincue de l'identité et de la citoyenneté de chacun des demandeurs.
[8]
Dès le début de la décision, l'agente de CIC a décrit le caractère exceptionnel de la demande CH et a déclaré qu'il incombait aux demandeurs d'établir qu'ils feraient face à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives s'ils devaient présenter leur demande de résidence permanente par la voie normale, c'est-à-dire de l'étranger.
[9]
La demande CH était fondée sur trois motifs, à savoir: le degré d'établissement au Canada, l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et la situation dans le pays d'origine. Que ces trois motifs soient pris séparément ou ensemble, ils ne justifient pas une dispense fondée sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire.
[10]
Premièrement, en ce qui a trait au niveau d'établissement au Canada, l'agente de CIC a examiné la situation d'emploi ainsi que les antécédents d'emploi du demandeur principal et de son épouse, tant au Canada qu'aux É.-U., et a conclu qu'ils n'avaient pas établi de façon adéquate la raison pour laquelle ils ne seraient pas en mesure de trouver du travail en Haïti s'ils devaient y retourner, étant donné leurs expériences professionnelles. En outre, ils n'ont pas démontré leur autonomie financière et la façon dont le fait de perdre leur emploi ici, en raison de l'obligation de présenter leur demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger, mènerait à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives.
[11]
L'agente de CIC a aussi pris en compte d'autres arguments avancés par les demandeurs relativement à leur établissement au Canada, en particulier les piètres perspectives d'emploi en Haïti et le fait que les demandeurs apportent du soutien financier aux membres de leur famille en Haïti, lesquels ont subi les dévastations du tremblement de terre de 2010. Néanmoins, l'agente de CIC a noté qu'une STR était en vigueur en raison de l'instabilité actuelle en Haïti, ce qui signifie que les demandeurs pouvaient demeurer et travailler au Canada entre-temps, et continuer à soutenir leur famille jusqu'à ce que la STR soit levée. Enfin, l'agente de CIC a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas suffisamment démontré le caractère adéquat du niveau de leur établissement et de leur intégration au Canada et la façon dont la rupture des liens avec le Canada résulterait en des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, s'ils devaient présenter leur demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger.
[12]
Deuxièmement, l'agente de CIC a examiné l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et a commencé par l'observation que les trois enfants sont des citoyens américains. L'agente de CIC a examiné une lettre d'une organisation dénommée
La Maisonnée, services d'aide et de liaison pour immigrants
, dans laquelle il était souligné que la situation en Haïti était difficile et que les enfants étaient établis au Canada. L'agente de CIC a relevé que cette lettre était le seul élément de preuve produit relativement à l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et elle a conclu que les demandeurs, auxquels incombait de fournir une preuve suffisante, n'avaient pas démontré que leurs enfants étaient bien établis et intégrés au Canada.
[13]
L'agente de CIC a aussi conclu que l'unité familiale ne serait pas compromise si les demandeurs devaient retourner en Haïti pour présenter leur demande de résidence permanente. Étant donné que les demandeurs n'avaient pas prouvé qu'ils ne seraient pas en mesure de travailler dans leur pays d'origine, l'agente de CIC a conclu qu'ils n'avaient pas non plus établi que leurs enfants ne pouvaient pas bien s'y adapter et qu'ils seraient privés du soutien émotionnel, physique et matériel de leurs parents en Haïti. L'agente de CIC a aussi relevé que, malgré le fait que le fardeau de la preuve pesait sur eux, les demandeurs n'ont fourni aucun élément de preuve documentaire relativement à leur allégation selon laquelle le système d'éducation en Haïti était d'une qualité moindre. Cela étant dit, l'agente de CIC a consulté la documentation objective et publique relative à la situation difficile actuelle du système d'éducation haïtien, mais elle a néanmoins conclu que, jusqu'à ce que la STR pour Haïti soit levée, les demandeurs pouvaient demeurer au Canada et leurs enfants pouvaient continuer à bénéficier du système d'éducation canadien. Bien qu'elle se soit déclarée sensible et réceptive aux intérêts supérieurs de l'enfant, l'agente de CIC a maintenu que ce facteur n'était pas plus important que les autres intérêts au point d'entraîner une présomption
prima facie
selon laquelle il devrait toujours prévaloir. Les demandeurs n'ont simplement pas avancé de preuve suffisante à l'appui de leurs allégations.
[14]
Troisièmement, en ce qui concerne la situation dans le pays d'origine, l'agente de CIC a rappelé que sous le régime de la nouvelle loi, le ministre « ne tient compte d'aucun des facteurs servant à établir la qualité de réfugié - au sens de la Convention - aux termes de l'article 96 ou de personne à protéger au titre du paragraphe 97(1); il tient compte, toutefois, des difficultés auxquelles l'étranger fait face ».
[15]
Selon l'agente de CIC, les demandeurs n'ont fourni aucune preuve documentaire objective relative à la situation généralement difficile dans leur pays d'origine, à l'exception d'un certain nombre de lettres non signées de membres de leur famille. L'agente de CIC a néanmoins de sa propre initiative entrepris d'examiner la preuve objective et publique, et elle a reconnu que la situation en Haïti était en réalité difficile, en particulier depuis le tremblement de terre de 2010. Toutefois, elle a noté que cette situation difficile et ces conditions de vie précaires touchaient l'ensemble de la population haïtienne, et non pas seulement les demandeurs. L'agente de CIC a fait référence à la STR en vigueur pour Haïti, elle a ajouté que cette mesure est une conséquence directe d'un risque généralisé et non pas d'un risque personnalisé, et elle a relevé que, malgré la STR, les demandeurs ne s'étaient pas déchargés du fardeau de prouver que, dans leur situation précise, ils feraient face à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives s'ils devaient présenter leur demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger, une fois que la STR serait levée.
[16]
L'agente de CIC a conclu par la déclaration selon laquelle les demandeurs qui bénéficient encore de la STR pouvaient continuer leur intégration au Canada et présenter ultérieurement une autre demande CH.
IV.
Observations des demandeurs
[17]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agente de CIC a conclu de façon erronée qu'ils feraient face à un risque généralisé en Haïti, et que cette conclusion viciait le reste de la décision. Ils présentent trois arguments principaux: 1) l'agente de CIC a commis des erreurs susceptibles de contrôle dans son appréciation des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, lorsqu'elle a conclu que la situation actuelle en Haïti présentait un risque généralisé et non pas un risque personnalisé, 2) l'agente de CIC a erronément fondé son raisonnement sur l'existence d'une STR pour Haïti, 3) l'agente de CIC a minimisé l'intérêt supérieur des enfants.
[18]
Les demandeurs avancent en premier lieu l'argument selon lequel l'agente de CIC a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle dans son appréciation des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, lorsqu'elle a conclu que la situation actuelle en Haïti s'élevait au niveau d'un risque généralisé. En fait, ils allèguent que ce faisant, l'agente de CIC a mal compris le critère applicable et a appliqué une norme trop stricte - on s'attendait à ce que les demandeurs prouvent qu'ils étaient exposés à un risque personnalisé. La Cour a récemment accueilli une demande de contrôle judiciaire dans laquelle elle a conclu que l'agent avait commis une erreur quand il a fondé son analyse sur le risque et non pas sur le préjudice. Aussi, comme la Cour l'a confirmé à maintes reprises, les motifs auraient dû être centrés sur les difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives auxquelles les demandeurs étaient exposés et non pas sur les risques futurs, lesquels sont applicables à une demande d'asile ou à un examen des risques avant renvoi.
[19]
De plus, l'agente de CIC a fait référence à une décision rendue avant l'entrée en vigueur de la nouvelle loi, laquelle a écarté l'application des articles 96 et 97 dans la décision relative à une demande CH. Dans le nouveau régime législatif, le guide IP 5 -
Demande présentée par des immigrants au Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire
(le guide IP 5) a été modifié pour donner l'ordre explicite aux agents de CIC de ne pas tenir compte des critères applicables au titre des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR, et de se concentrer sur les « difficultés auxquelles l'étranger fait face » notamment, les « conditions défavorables dans le pays qui ont une incidence néfaste directe sur le demandeur ». Toutefois, en l'espèce et contrairement à cette directive, l'agente de CIC a appliqué le critère qui faisait partie de l'article 97, lorsqu'elle a déclaré que la situation actuelle en Haïti touchait l'ensemble de la population et constituait donc un risque généralisé et non pas un risque personnalisé. Toutefois, les demandeurs avaient présenté la preuve de « l'incidence néfaste directe » subie et l'agente de CIC a elle-même identifié dans la preuve documentaire plusieurs éléments qui établissaient des conditions défavorables dans la situation générale en Haïti.
[20]
En guise de deuxième argument, les demandeurs allèguent que l'agente de CIC a erronément fondé son raisonnement sur l'existence d'une STR pour Haïti. Bien qu'il soit vrai que l'existence d'une STR pour un pays particulier ne justifierait pas une issue favorable pour toute demande CH présentée relativement à ce pays, elle ne peut très certainement pas systématiquement mener à une issue défavorable. Selon le guide IP 5, précité, l'existence d'une STR peut être prise en compte dans l'appréciation de l'établissement d'un demandeur au Canada. Toutefois, à de nombreuses occasions dans la présente affaire, l'agente de CIC a simplement comblé les lacunes de son analyse par la déclaration selon laquelle, quelle que soit l'issue de sa décision, les demandeurs demeureraient au Canada.
[21]
Le troisième et dernier argument avancé par les demandeurs a trait à l'appréciation faite par l'agente de CIC de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants. Ils avancent que l'agente de CIC a minimisé la preuve existant à cet égard. Selon la jurisprudence et le guide IP 5, l'agent doit « toujours être vigilant et sensible à l'égard de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant ». En l'espèce, l'agente de CIC a conclu à l'absence de preuve quant à l'intégration des enfants au Canada, après avoir rejeté la lettre de l'organisation
La Maisonnée, service d'aide et de liaison pour les immigrants
, mais elle n'a pas expliqué pourquoi elle a rejeté cette lettre. En outre, l'agente de CIC n'a jamais examiné le fait que les enfants sont des citoyens américains et qu'ils n'ont aucun lien avec Haïti. Toutefois, les demandeurs soutiennent que, dans leur affidavit, ils ont présenté une série d'éléments qui indiquent que les enfants sont dans une bien meilleure position au Canada qu'ils ne le seraient jamais en Haïti.
[22]
En outre, bien que les demandeurs n'aient pas présenté un large éventail de preuves, l'agente de CIC a néanmoins examiné la documentation et a reconnu l'existence de conditions défavorables dans ce pays en ce qui a trait aux enfants, mais elle a déclaré que l'existence d'une STR protégeait en quelque sorte les demandeurs. Une fois de plus, l'agente de CIC a comblé les lacunes de son analyse en se fondant sur l'existence de la STR. Enfin, les demandeurs soutiennent que le processus adopté par l'agente de CIC pour l'analyse de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants ne prenait pas en compte les décisions récentes de la Cour.
[23]
Par conséquent, parce que l'agente de CIC a appliqué le mauvais critère dans son appréciation des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, parce qu'elle a accordé trop d'importance à l'existence d'une STR pour Haïti et parce qu'elle a minimisé l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, sa décision ne peut pas être maintenue.
V.
Observations du défendeur
[24]
Le défendeur soutient que la décision de l'agente de CIC était raisonnable et devrait être maintenue principalement parce qu'elle a fondé sa décision sur le fait que les demandeurs n'avaient pas fourni de preuves objectives suffisantes, et parce que la décision était hautement discrétionnaire et résultait d'une appréciation purement factuelle de l'affaire.
[25]
Premièrement, le défendeur allègue que l'agente de CIC n'a pas commis d'erreur susceptible de contrôle dans son appréciation des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, lorsqu'elle a conclu que la situation actuelle en Haïti présentait un risque généralisé par opposition à un risque personnalisé. En fait, les demandeurs n'ont présenté aucune preuve objective de la situation actuelle dans le pays, et ils n'ont pratiquement avancé aucune allégation quant à leur possible situation future en Haïti. De plus, bien que l'agente de CIC ait en fait déclaré que les demandeurs seraient dans la même situation que le reste de la population haïtienne, elle a clairement énoncé qu'ils n'avaient pas démontré comment cette situation mènerait à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives pour eux. Ce fardeau incombait aux demandeurs. Le demandeur principal a produit un affidavit décrivant les difficultés auxquelles sa famille serait exposée en Haïti, mais cet affidavit n'a pas été soumis à l'agente de CIC et les renseignements qui y étaient contenus ne devraient pas être pris en compte dans le cadre du présent contrôle judiciaire.
[26]
En outre, en ce qui a trait à la situation actuelle en Haïti, le défendeur soutient que la situation difficile générale dans ce pays ne suffit pas à octroyer une dispense pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire.
[27]
Deuxièmement, en ce qui a trait à l'argument des demandeurs selon lequel l'agente de CIC s'est erronément fondée sur l'existence d'une STR pour Haïti, le défendeur rappelle à la Cour que l'existence d'une STR ne justifie pas automatiquement de faire droit à une demande CH. Bien que l'agente de CIC ait tenu compte du fait que les demandeurs demeureront au Canada jusqu'à ce que la STR soit levée, cet élément ne constituait en rien le fondement de la décision, il s'agissait simplement d'un commentaire supplémentaire, étant donné que la décision de l'agente de CIC était fondée sur le fait que les demandeurs n'avaient pas fourni de preuves suffisantes à l'appui de leurs allégations.
[28]
De plus, en ce qui concerne l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada, l'agente de CIC a tenu compte des circonstances de l'affaire et a conclu que l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada ne constituait pas un motif suffisant. Cette décision était raisonnable puisqu'il incombait aux demandeurs de prouver leurs allégations et ils ne l'ont pas fait. Le défendeur soutient en outre que la question de l'intégration au Canada n'est pas en soi suffisante pour prouver l'existence de difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives auxquelles une partie pourrait faire face, si on lui demandait de présenter sa demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger.
[29]
Troisièmement, en ce qui concerne l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, une fois de plus les demandeurs n'ont simplement pas produit de preuve documentaire suffisante relative en particulier à l'intégration des enfants au Canada, aux raisons pour lesquelles ils ne pouvaient pas bénéficier du soutien de leurs parents en Haïti, et aux allégations selon lesquelles les enfants ne pouvaient pas se prévaloir d'une éducation d'une qualité similaire à celle qu'ils ont au Canada. Ils n'ont pratiquement présenté aucune preuve selon laquelle l'intérêt des enfants serait compromis, s'ils étaient déplacés en Haïti. En fait, l'agente de CIC a tenu compte du peu de preuve présentée par les demandeurs - et a explicitement reconnu la lettre en cause de
La Maisonnée, services d'aide et de liaison pour immigrants -
et, une fois de plus, elle a de sa propre initiative entrepris d'examiner la documentation générale. En définitive, elle a raisonnablement conclu que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants ne justifiait pas une dispense pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. L'agente de CIC n'a en rien minimisé l'intérêt supérieur des enfants: l'appréciation de cette question doit être faite dans la prise en compte plus générale quant à savoir si, eu égard à toutes les circonstances, notamment l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, les demandeurs feraient face à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, s'ils devaient présenter leur demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger.
[30]
Le défendeur soutient aussi que les demandeurs sollicitent de la Cour qu'elle réexamine la preuve qui était soumise à l'agente de CIC relativement à l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, parce qu'ils ne sont pas satisfaits de la décision que l'agente de CIC a raisonnablement rendue. Toutefois, l'appréciation de la preuve était tâche de l'agente de CIC et non pas celle de la Cour.
VI.
Réponse des demandeurs
[31]
Dans leur réponse aux arguments du défendeur, les demandeurs font référence à des paragraphes précis de leurs observations originales, et ainsi, ils ne présentent aucun autre argument.
[32]
Toutefois, ils invitent la Cour à prendre en compte la nouvelle jurisprudence qui clarifie davantage la nature des difficultés subies et l'importance de s'en tenir à une analyse des difficultés dans le cadre d'une demande CH, plutôt que de procéder à une appréciation du risque personnalisé.
VII.
Questions en litige
[33]
Le présent litige soulève les deux questions suivantes:
1. L'agente de CIC a-t-elle appliqué le bon critère juridique au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR comme il est lié à l'appréciation de la situation actuelle en Haïti pour déterminer l'existence de difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives?
2. L'agente de CIC a-t-elle adéquatement apprécié les considérations d'ordre humanitaire au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR, plus précisément en ce qu'elles ont trait à l'appréciation de la situation actuelle en Haïti pour déterminer l'existence de difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, à la mention de la STR en vigueur en Haïti et à la prise en compte de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants?
VIII.
Norme de contrôle
[34]
La Cour suprême du Canada a énoncé au paragraphe 62 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACS no 9 (
Dunsmuir)
, qu'une analyse à deux étapes de la norme de contrôle est nécessaire afin de déterminer la norme applicable à une cause précise. La première étape de cette analyse est que la cour saisie « vérifie si la jurisprudence établit déjà de manière satisfaisante le degré de déférence correspondant à une catégorie de questions en particulier ».
[35]
En ce qui concerne la première question, celle relative au critère juridique applicable, la juge Gleason de la Cour a récemment déclaré que: « il convient, selon la jurisprudence, d'appliquer la norme de la décision correcte dans l'examen de l'énoncé du critère à employer pour savoir si une demande CH est ou non recevable » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF no 124, au paragraphe 25).
[36]
En ce qui concerne la deuxième question, celle relative à l'appréciation de la preuve présentée, au paragraphe 62 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a établi que la norme de contrôle applicable dans le cadre des contrôles judiciaires des décisions relatives aux demandes CH est la décision raisonnable. Cette norme de contrôle a été confirmée, après l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 713, au paragraphe 18, et suivie dans les décisions récentes de la Cour (voir par exemple la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 259;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1005, au paragraphe 12).
[37]
Par conséquent, en ce qui concerne la deuxième question, la Cour doit se demander « si la décision appar[tient] aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47) et doit faire preuve d'une grande retenue eu égard à la décision de l'agente de CIC (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] ACS no 3).
IX.
Analyse
A.
L'agente de CIC a-t-elle appliqué le bon critère juridique au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR comme il est lié à l'appréciation de la situation actuelle en Haïti pour déterminer l'existence de difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives?
[38]
La première question traite de l'identification du critère que l'agente de CIC a appliqué lorsqu'elle a établi quelles étaient les considérations d'ordre humanitaire au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR en l'espèce. A-t-elle examiné les facteurs pris en compte pour statuer sur les demandes présentées au titre de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR? A-t-elle plutôt examiné les éléments liés aux difficultés auxquelles l'étranger fait face?
[39]
Selon les demandeurs, l'agente de CIC a commis une erreur dans son appréciation des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives de la situation actuelle en Haïti, lorsqu'elle a conclu que la situation en Haïti s'élevait au niveau d'un risque généralisé, ce qui fait partie des facteurs pris en compte en application de l'article 97. Toutefois, je conclus que l'agente de CIC a appliqué le bon critère, à savoir, celui lié aux difficultés et ainsi, l'intervention de la Cour n'est pas justifiée quant à cette question.
[40]
Tout d'abord, je dois reconnaître que les arguments factuels des demandeurs sont d'une certaine façon valides, parce que l'agente de CIC a en réalité fait référence, à de nombreuses reprises, à la situation générale en Haïti et a conclu qu'ils ne seraient pas exposés à des conditions différentes de celles auxquelles l'ensemble de la population haïtienne est exposée. Comme les demandeurs l'ont soutenu à bon droit, et comme l'agente de CIC l'a dûment relevé dans sa décision, à la suite de la modification du paragraphe 25(1.3) de la LIPR par la
Loi sur des mesures de réforme équitables concernant les réfugiés
, LC 2010, c 8, la preuve présentée dans les demandes CH ne doit plus être appréciée à la lumière des facteurs pertinents aux demandes présentées au titre de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR, lesquels comprenaient une distinction entre le risque généralisé et le risque personnalisé, facteur pertinent au titre de l'article 97 (voir par exemple le paragraphe 26 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 1291).
[41]
Cette modification s'est reflétée dans le guide IP 5, lequel est maintenant rédigé de la façon suivante: [...] « [b]ien qu'il ne puisse tenir compte des facteurs visés aux L96 et L97, le décideur doit tenir compte des éléments liés aux difficultés auxquelles l'étranger fait face », lesquels peuvent inclure « des conditions défavorables dans le pays qui ont une incidence néfaste directe sur le demandeur ». À cet égard, la conduite de l'agente de CIC montre qu'elle a pris en compte les facteurs visés aux articles 96 et 97, de même que les nouveaux critères établis et énoncés dans le guide IP 5, c'est-à-dire les difficultés auxquelles les demandeurs feraient face, s'ils devaient retourner dans leur pays d'origine. Toutefois, lorsque je lis la décision dans son ensemble, je conclus que l'agente de CIC a effectivement appliqué le bon critère juridique. De plus, même si les demandeurs avaient le fardeau d'avancer des éléments de preuve, ils ont clairement manqué à leur obligation et cela est significatif. Somme toute, il peut y avoir une apparence de confusion dans l'application du bon critère juridique, mais en définitive, lorsque la décision est prise dans son ensemble, le bon critère juridique a été appliqué.
B
. L'agente de CIC a-t-elle adéquatement apprécié les considérations d'ordre humanitaire au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR, plus précisément en ce qu'elles ont trait à l'appréciation de la situation actuelle en Haïti pour déterminer l'existence de difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, à la mention de la STR en vigueur en Haïti, et à la prise en compte de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants?
[42]
La Cour conclut que la décision rendue par l'agente de CIC, bien qu'elle soit imparfaite, est néanmoins raisonnable, principalement parce que les demandeurs n'ont pas produit de preuve suffisante à l'appui de leurs allégations.
[43]
En fait, eu égard aux trois facteurs, je conclus que les demandeurs sollicitent simplement de la Cour qu'elle soupèse à nouveau le peu de preuve qu'ils avaient présentée à l'agente de CIC dans leur demande CH. Toutefois, la tâche d'apprécier et de soupeser cette preuve ressort de la responsabilité du décideur et non pas de celle de la Cour, étant donné que la Cour a déclaré ce qui suit au paragraphe 7 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). De plus, le délégué du ministre qui est saisi d'une demande CH a la responsabilité d'examiner la preuve et de lui accorder le poids approprié: ce n'est pas le rôle du tribunal d'instance supérieure (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandes CH, il incombe aux demandeurs de fournir les preuves à l'appui de leurs allégations:
[5] [...] De surcroît, le demandeur a le fardeau de prouver toute allégation sur laquelle il fonde sa demande pour des raisons humanitaires. Par voie de conséquence, si un demandeur ne soumet aucune preuve à l'appui de son allégation, l'agent est en droit de conclure qu'elle n'est pas fondée. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2004] ACF no 158 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
En fait, la Cour d'appel fédérale a réitéré cette déclaration au paragraphe 35 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 713 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), lorsqu'elle a conclu ainsi: « Il est incontestable qu'il incombait aux appelants d'établir le bien-fondé des allégations contenues dans leur demande fondée sur des raisons d'ordre humanitaire ». Par conséquent, les demandeurs doivent toujours prouver qu'ils feraient face à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, s'ils devaient présenter leur demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger.
[45]
Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessus, la Cour conclut que, en dehors de l'analyse qu'elle a entreprise pour chacune des allégations, l'agente de CIC a principalement rejeté la demande CH des demandeurs parce qu'ils ne se sont pas déchargés du fardeau de la preuve, ce qui rend donc la décision soumise au contrôle raisonnable.
1.
Situation actuelle en Haïti
[46]
Comme énoncé précédemment, bien que l'agente de CIC fasse référence au fait que les demandeurs auraient été dans la même situation difficile que le reste de la population haïtienne, je conclus qu'elle n'a pas fondé son refus uniquement sur ce raisonnement. La Cour conclut que l'agente de CIC a d'abord et avant tout rejeté la demande CH parce que les demandeurs n'ont pas fourni de preuves suffisantes à l'appui de leurs allégations. En fait, ils ont fourni très peu d'éléments à l'agente de CIC pour que celle-ci puisse faire son travail: leur demande CH contenait seulement des allégations étayées par des lettres non signées de membres de leur famille ou de leurs connaissances vivant en Haïti. Ils n'ont fourni absolument aucune preuve documentaire objective reflétant les difficultés auxquelles ils feraient face en Haïti, ou comme l'agente de CIC l'a déclaré « les demandeurs n'ont toutefois pas soumis de preuves documentaires objectives sur la situation générale dans le pays ». Dans la décision, l'agente de CIC a estimé que le peu d'éléments de preuve produits par les demandeurs, qu'elle a réellement examinés et appréciés, n'étaient pas suffisants. Cela suffisait à rejeter la demande CH parce que le fardeau pesait sur les demandeurs. Il n'appartient pas à la Cour de soupeser à nouveau cette preuve.
[47]
De plus, après avoir conclu qu'on ne lui avait pas présenté de preuve pouvant aider les demandeurs, l'agente de CIC a de sa propre initiative entrepris d'examiner la preuve documentaire publique et objective, même si elle n'avait pas à le faire. Si elle ne l'avait pas fait, l'agente de CIC n'aurait rien eu à examiner relativement à la situation générale en Haïti, et, compte tenu de sa conclusion précitée, la demande CH aurait certainement été rejetée, simplement parce que les demandeurs n'ont pratiquement fourni aucune preuve à l'appui de leurs observations. La question de savoir si cette preuve a été interprétée eu égard au risque personnalisé pour les demandeurs ou eu égard à un risque généralisé pour l'ensemble de la population haïtienne importe peu - étant donné que les demandeurs n'ont pour ainsi dire présenté aucune preuve relative à la situation actuelle en Haïti et que cela suffit à rejeter leur demande, l'agente de CIC ne peut certainement pas être prise en défaut pour son appréciation de la preuve qu'elle a dû produire elle-même!
[48]
À partir de cette conclusion raisonnable, et compte tenu de l'indubitable manque de preuve dans la présente affaire en ce qui concerne la situation actuelle en Haïti, le fait de renvoyer l'affaire à l'agente de CIC sur cette seule question serait un exercice théorique.
[49]
Par conséquent, bien que la décision de l'agente de CIC ne soit pas parfaite, la Cour conclut que l'agente de CIC n'a pas commis d'erreur susceptible de contrôle dans son appréciation des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives auxquelles les demandeurs feraient face, puisqu'ils n'ont produit aucune preuve objective de telles difficultés malgré le fait qu'il leur incombait de convaincre l'agente de CIC du bien-fondé de leurs allégations.
2.
Intérêt supérieur des enfants
[50]
En ce qui concerne l'argument des demandeurs selon lequel l'agente de CIC a minimisé l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, le raisonnement de la Cour sera très semblable à celui appliqué au premier argument des demandeurs.
[51]
Ici, encore une fois, les demandeurs n'ont simplement pas fourni de preuve suffisante. En fait, ils ont produit une lettre de l'organisation
La Maisonnée, services d'aide et de liaison pour immigrants
, lettre que l'agente de CIC a prise en compte et qu'elle a explicitement admise dans sa décision, mais elle a raisonnablement conclu qu'il s'agissait d'une preuve insuffisante pour établir l'intégration des enfants au Canada. Comme mentionné ci-dessus, il incombait aux demandeurs de produire des éléments de preuve suffisants à l'appui de leurs allégations. À de nombreuses occasions, l'agente de CIC a expliqué qu'ils n'ont pas présenté de preuve suffisante établissant la situation difficile à laquelle les enfants feraient face en Haïti ni le fait que les enfants ne pourraient bénéficier du soutien émotionnel, physique et matériel de leurs parents en Haïti.
[52]
Une fois de plus, en présence d'un grand manque de preuve, l'agente de CIC a décidé, de sa propre initiative, d'examiner les documents publics et objectifs relatifs à la situation des enfants dans le pays d'origine. Comme cela était le cas pour le premier argument des demandeurs et comme énoncé ci-dessus, ce manque de preuve aurait été suffisant pour rejeter la demande CH, parce que si l'agente n'avait pas examiné d'autres documents, elle n'aurait pratiquement rien eu pour évaluer l'intérêt supérieur des enfants.
[53]
Toutefois, l'agente de CIC a en quelque sorte évalué l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et, comme mentionné ci-dessus, elle ne peut pas être prise en défaut pour son appréciation de la preuve qu'elle a elle-même avancée, en raison du défaut des demandeurs de le faire. Étant donné que les demandeurs n'ont pour ainsi dire pas présenté de preuve à l'appui de leurs allégations, la seule façon selon laquelle l'agente de CIC pouvait prendre en compte l'intérêt supérieur des enfants était au moyen de l'examen de la preuve documentaire qu'elle avait produit de sa propre initiative. Ainsi, cet argument ne justifie pas l'intervention de la Cour.

Mention de la STR en vigueur pour Haïti
[54]
Enfin, les demandeurs allèguent que l'agente de CIC a erronément fondé son raisonnement sur l'existence d'une STR pour Haïti, afin de combler les nombreuses lacunes de sa décision. Je conclus que cet argument ne justifie pas l'intervention de la Cour.
[55]
Pour plus de clarté, je dois commencer par préciser qu'une suspension temporaire des renvois est une mesure gouvernementale symptomatique d'un risque généralisé pour la population dans un pays précis et que, dans le contexte d'une demande CH, l'existence d'une STR relativement à un pays particulier ne peut pas automatiquement mener à une issue précise, qu'elle soit favorable ou défavorable. Ainsi, le fait qu'une STR soit en vigueur pour Haïti n'interdisait pas à l'agente de CIC de rejeter la demande CH (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 449, au paragraphe 17).
[56]
De manière similaire à la conclusion relative au premier argument des demandeurs, la Cour conclut que l'agente de CIC n'a pas fondé son raisonnement uniquement sur la STR, mais principalement sur le fait que les demandeurs n'ont pas fourni de preuve suffisante à l'appui de toutes leurs allégations. Comme énoncé précédemment, il incombait aux demandeurs de prouver qu'ils feraient face à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, s'ils devaient présenter leur demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger.
[57]
La Cour a déjà conclu qu'en réalité, les demandeurs n'avaient pas produit de preuve suffisante en ce qui a trait à la situation actuelle en Haïti et à l'intérêt supérieur des enfants. Il ne reste donc que l'analyse de la preuve présentée relativement à l'autre allégation contenue dans la demande CH: l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada.
[58]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agente de CIC s'est fondée sur l'existence d'une STR pour Haïti afin de combler les lacunes de son analyse portant sur leur établissement au Canada et sur l'intérêt supérieur des enfants. Dans son analyse de l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada, l'agente de CIC a tenu compte du peu d'éléments de preuve présentés par les demandeurs, et cette appréciation de la preuve repose sur son expertise et sa compétence. Elle a pris en compte leurs antécédents d'emploi et a ajouté que: « [...] aucun autre document n'a été déposé au dossier afin de démontrer leur autonomie financière [...] ». Les demandeurs avancent en outre que la situation de l'emploi est difficile en Haïti, mais comme mentionné ci-dessus, ils n'ont présenté aucune preuve objective de la situation dans le pays. Les demandeurs avancent aussi l'argument selon lequel ils apportent du soutien financier aux membres de leur famille en Haïti, mais ils n'ont pas produit de preuve documentaire pour l'établir, comme un relevé de dépôt bancaire.
[59]
De plus, après avoir pris en compte et soupesé la preuve, l'agente de CIC a raisonnablement conclu que l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada n'est pas un motif suffisant pour faire droit à une demande CH, comme la Cour l'a déclaré au paragraphe 43 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 795:
[43] Selon la jurisprudence, le niveau d'établissement au Canada n'est pas déterminant à l'égard d'une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. De même, les difficultés inhérentes à l'obligation de partir après avoir passé plusieurs années au Canada ne sont habituellement pas suffisantes pour justifier une dispense. Encore une fois, l'article 25 de la LIPR est destiné à offrir une dispense exceptionnelle en présence de difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées et excessives (

, précitée, aux paragraphes 51 et 52;
Wazid
, précitée, aux paragraphes 14 et 16;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 556, aux paragraphes 18 à 20;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 161, au paragraphe 2;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 111, aux paragraphes 9 et 10 et 36 à 40).
[60]
Comme énoncé précédemment, le rôle de la Cour n'est pas de soupeser à nouveau la preuve appréciée par l'agente de CIC.
[61]
Ainsi, bien que l'agente de CIC ait mentionné à de nombreuses reprises que les demandeurs, tant les adultes que les enfants, pouvaient rester au Canada en raison de la STR en vigueur pour Haïti, et donc continuer à bénéficier des avantages dus au fait de vivre au Canada, la Cour conclut que ces mentions de la STR sont de simples remarques de l'agente de CIC, ce qui ne les rend pas inadmissibles. Comme énoncé précédemment, elles n'ont pas été utilisées pour décider de l'issue de la cause. Au contraire, le facteur déterminant était le manque de preuve.
4.
Conclusion
[62]
En fait, je conclus que, comme l'agente de CIC l'a justement relevé, les demandeurs n'ont pas produit de preuve suffisante à l'appui de leurs allégations, malgré le fait qu'ils avaient le fardeau de prouver qu'ils feraient face à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, s'ils devaient présenter leur demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger. Je conclus aussi que l'agente de CIC a raisonnablement apprécié le peu de preuve qui lui a été soumise et elle est même allée plus loin que ce qui était attendu d'elle, lorsqu'elle a consulté de sa propre initiative des documents publics et objectifs. Bien que la décision soumise au contrôle soit loin d'être irréprochable, compte tenu du fait que le manque absolu de preuve présenté par les demandeurs suffit à rejeter la demande CH, la décision de l'agente de CIC appartient indubitablement aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit, et elle doit donc être maintenue.
