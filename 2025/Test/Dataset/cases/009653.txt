Muldoon, J.
: This application, brought pursuant to rule 324, is identical with motions on behalf of the defendants in the sequentially subsequent actions, above designated, in which James Workman and Glen Kane are respectively plaintiffs. These reasons, therefore, will serve for all three actions and copies hereof are to be lodged in all three files.
[2]
Although the defendants' solicitors' respective letters to the Registry as provided in rule 324(1) purport to have been forwarded in copy form to the plaintiffs' solicitors, yet the files disclose no formal response whatever by them opposing the application. In memoranda to file it appears that one of the court's registrars contacted the plaintiffs' solicitor and she indicated, on February 9, 1989, that she was encountering some difficulty in contacting the plaintiffs, and she sought then a further two weeks in which to respond. The extension was accorded by the defendants' solicitors.
[3]
The defendants' application in each action is for an order that:
"1. Leave be granted to these defendants to file a conditional appearance for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of this court over the defendants, pursuant to rule 401(c);
"2. The statement of claim does not disclose any reasonable cause of action falling within the court's jurisdiction as against the defendants, pursuant to rule 419(1)(a) and 401(c);
"3. Costs."
[4]
The defendants' solicitors move to strike out the respective statements of claim, invoking the following jurisprudence:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  S.C.R.
[5]
The defendants' solicitors, in their written submissions then argue, thus:
"A fortori [sic], where the tort complained of is essentially an assault and as a corollary, a Charter breach then there is no reasonable cause of action falling within, the jurisdiction of the court as against
any
of the defendants."
[6]
This argument fails to take account of s. 3 of the Crown Liability Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-38 (now R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50). The provision in force at the time the actions were commenced on April 20, 1988, was this:
"3(1) The Crown is liable
in tort
for the damages for which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be liable
(a) in respect of a
tort
committed by a servant of the Crown ..." (Emphasis not in original text)
Section 4(2) of that statute is also germane, and it provides:
"4(2) No proceedings lie against the Crown by virtue of paragraph 3(1)(a) in respect of any act or omission of a servant of the Crown
unless
the act or omission would apart from the provisions of this Act have given rise to a cause of action
in tort
against that servant or his personal representative." (Emphasis not in original text)
[7]
It is apparent that members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are indeed servants of the Crown. Section 38 of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, asserts it. It is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs' respective actions sound in tort, that is to say "assault and battery" and "wrongful imprisonment", although such torts ought better to be specifically alleged prior to the statement of claim's prayer for relief, as well as in it. Section 15(1) of the recently proclaimed Crown Liability Act confers on the Federal Court, subject to certain nonpertinent considerations "exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine every claim for damages under this Act". Thus, it is evident that the three criteria enunciated in the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , affirmed by the Appeal Division of this court (1975), 12 N.R. 477; 61 D.L.R.(3d) 130, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Appeal Division unanimously sustained an action for the torts of false arrest and imprisonment personally against two members of the National Parole Board who are appointees of the Governor-in-Council, while striking out the same action brought against the Board itself and two public servants. The court there also invoked  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  damages resulting from their commission are recoverable in the Trial Division. ... [T]he claims are provided for in 'the laws of Canada' or 'federal law'."
[10]
In the instant case it could be said that the alleged torts depend for their existence on federal law, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-10, for the individual defendants derived their police authority and powers by reason of their being each "a member of the Force" pursuant to the definition thereof in s. 2 of the Act. It is alleged in paragraph 13 of the statement of claim T-774-88, as an incident of the alleged torts that the defendants Geiger and Berry locked the plaintiff Workman in a cell. In action T-773-88, it is alleged, in paragraph 11, that all three individual defendants "locked the Plaintiff [Bradasch] in a cell at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment". In action T-775-88, it is alleged, in paragraph 11, that the defendant Berry "forced the Plaintiff [Kane] into a motor vehicle and took him to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment in ...", and in paragraph 13, that the defendant Geiger "locked the Plaintiff in a cell ...". It seems that the individual defendants could hardly have committed the specified alleged torts if they had not been invested with the authority, duties and powers conferred upon them each as "a member of the Force" pursuant to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, an authentic law of Canada.
[11]
Here is what the Appeal Division said in the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  case, at p. 522:
"The only remaining question is whether there is here a 'statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament' to satisfy the first requirement. In my view, such a grant of jurisdiction is found in paragraph 17(4)(b) of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10:
'17(4) The Trial Division has concurrent original jurisdiction
. . . . .
(b) in proceedings in which relief is sought against any person for anything done or omitted to be done in the performance of his duties as an officer of the Crown.'
"While the word 'officer' is not defined by that Act, the definition of 'public officer' in section 2 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23 is relief upon:
'2(1) ...
"public officer" includes any person in the public service of Canada
(a) who is authorized by or under an enactment to do or enforce the doing of an act or thing or to exercise a power, or
(b) upon whom a duty is imposed by or under an enactment.'
"I do not think it necessary to deal in any definitive way with the point, there being no evidence before us that establishes the duties and responsibilities of the two individual respondents. In view of this lack of evidence the parties are content that each of the respondents be considered an 'officer' of the National Parole Board for purposes of this appeal. On that basis, I am satisfied that paragraph 17(4)(b) of the Federal Court Act does confer jurisdiction on the Trial Division to hear and determine the claims made against the individual respondents in the action. I see no reason for giving the language of that paragraph a narrower construction."
[12]
The individual defendants here are certainly "public officers". So ought they to be retained as defendants in accordance with paragraph 17(4)(b) of the Federal Court Act as it was interpreted by the Appeal Division in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  having to defend themselves in this court.
[13]
The court harbours doubts about the correctness of the Oag decision, but ought loyally and lawfully to follow it. Applying the Appeal Division's interpretation of paragraph 17(4)(b) of the Federal Court Act, the court, hesitantly in light of the abundant earlier jurisprudence, declines to strike out the statement of claim in regard to the three individual defendant police officers in their capacities as officers or servants of the Crown. The Crown is properly impleaded here.
[14]
The application to strike out the statement of claim is, therefore, dismissed. The plaintiffs are awarded no costs in view of the fact that their solicitors did not participate in these proceedings. The individual defendants may, in light of the abundant earlier jurisprudence, wish to lodge an appeal. Therefore, if the said defendants do lodge an appeal neither they nor the Crown shall be obliged to file statements of defence until after the judgment on appeal, so long as they diligently prosecute their appeals. If they do not, the plaintiffs may move to require the filing of the statements of defence. Pursuant to the provisions of s. 27(2) of the Act the time hereby fixed for filing the defendants' notices of appeal is extended to, and shall expire on, close of business in the Whitehorse registry on Thursday, March 16, 1989. If the defendants elect not to appeal, their statements of defence are to be filed by, and not later than, the said time on March 16, 1989, unless the plaintiffs before that time, or later, relent.
Application dismissed.
