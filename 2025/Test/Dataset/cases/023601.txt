Introduction
[1]
Annis, J.
: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to section 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of an August 24, 2012 decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.
[2]
For the reasons which follow, the application is dismissed.
Factual background
[3]
The applicant was born in Poland in 1958. The applicant married in 1979 and had three children from this marriage. It ended in 1988, at which point the applicant formed a new relationship with a common law partner Tadeusz Poniewierski, with whom she had three additional children. The relationship with Mr. Poniewierski was abusive. However the applicant remained with him until 2006, notwithstanding physical injuries including a broken nose, broken arms and legs and problems with one of her ears.
[4]
The applicant called the police many times but they just told her to resolve her own marital problems. Her second partner shared a pigeon-breeding hobby with the chief of the village police force and drank with other police officers. He was once arrested after assaulting her, but was released on probation. She finally broke up with him, but he did not move away. He continued to come by her house frequently to harass her.
[5]
Ms. Czesak visited Canada from September 2005 to March 2006. When she returned to Poland, her ex-partner met her at the Warsaw airport, forced his way into the car and came back to her house with her. There, he broke the door and windows, punched her son, and pushed her down the stairs, knocking her out.
[6]
She flew to Canada in July 2006 on another visitor's six-month visa and never left. She was initially granted a six-month visa extension, but she says that her family discouraged her from applying for a further extension and told her to just stay on illegally. They did not meet the financial criteria to sponsor her.
[7]
The applicant did not discover that it was possible to apply for asylum until she was stopped by the police, apparently for jaywalking, and sent to immigration detention. Her family did not pay bail, despite promising to do so. She remained in detention for three months until the Toronto Bail Program assisted her. While she was there the Refugee Law Office provided her advice and she submitted an application for refugee status on October 7, 2009.
[8]
She has not seen her ex-partner since 2006 but was advised that he called her mother in Canada in May or June 2009 looking for her. He continues to visit her house in Poland and threaten her relatives there. She collected some documentation of the problems, but her ex-partner stole those papers from her house. She asked her children still in Poland and her youngest child's guardian to obtain records but they could not. She provided evidence of a Family Court decision from 2009 terminating her and Mr. Poniewierski's parental rights over their children. Her counsel sent at least four requests to Poland, in English and translated into Polish, with signed consent forms, which did not result in further documentation being provided.
[9]
Ms Czesak now lives in difficult circumstances in Toronto and has been assessed by a social worker with the Barbara Schlifer Clinic as withdrawn and possibly traumatized. Doctors' assessments note that she suffers from back pain, post-traumatic headaches, memory loss, blackouts, depression and probably alcohol dependency.
Contested decision
[10]
At the hearing, the panel member accepted that Ms. Czesak had been "abused over a lengthy period of her second marriage" and noted that she had taken into account the
Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution
guidelines issued by the Chairperson [the "Gender Guidelines"] and the medical reports in making allowances for memory lapses and lack of focus. The determinative issues were delay in claiming, state protection, and internal flight alternative (IFA).
[11]
The panel member found that the delay in claiming asylum was inconsistent with a person living in fear of persecution to fail to seek asylum as soon as possible. The claimant's family may have provided her with poor, and moreover unscrupulous, advice, but she was aware of her illegal status and took no steps to regularize it. The panel drew an adverse inference and found that her credibility was undermined. However, I do not find that the rejection of refugee status is based on delay or the applicant's general credibility.
[12]
The panel member reviewed the law and the applicant's evidence on state protection. It found that there was insufficient clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption that Poland was incapable of protecting its citizens. The panel carried out an extensive review of the evidence on lack of state protection, noting that Poland was making serious efforts to protect women, particularly since joining the European Union, and that there was clear and convincing evidence that these efforts were adequate. Poland had adopted an Act on Counteracting Violence in the Family on November 5, 2005. Prosecutions were being brought against persons convicted of domestic violence who could be sentenced to a maximum five years in prison, although sentences tended to be more lenient. The number of victims' claims was increasing every year. For the latest statistics in 2007, it was reported that police conducted 81,403 interventions related to domestic violence. Of that number the justice ministry stated that 15,404 were convicted and that at year's end 4,500 individuals were serving jail sentences for domestic violence crimes, demonstrating that the country acts to combat crime.
[13]
Police misconduct was a problem, but was also being addressed. The panel referred to documentary evidence acknowledging that the police could be reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes and that protection for women in abusive situations was sometimes insufficient. However, Poland was making efforts to improve police responsiveness, and although counsel had submitted material from Amnesty International, Freedom House, the European Police Action Centre on Violence Against Women, and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, this documentation was five to seven years old. The panel found that the claimant had provided no persuasive evidence that her ex-partner had connections with the police which could prevent her from accessing state protection.
[14]
The panel did not accept the applicant's explanation of why she had delayed requesting police documents until just prior to the hearing, or her explanation that some reports could not be provided because officers were changing jobs, or her claim that Mr. Poniewierski had stolen documents from her house when he realized she wanted to remain in Canada. The panel similarly found unreasonable her waiting until two weeks prior to the hearing to obtain medical documents, when she had filed her claim for asylum in 2009.
[15]
The panel next considered the city of Warsaw, 300-400 kilometres from Ms. Czesak's former place of residence in Poland, as an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). The panel again reviewed the extensive jurisprudence governing IFAs, including the insufficiency of arguments that claimants had no friends or family in the region, or could not find suitable work there, or might be better off in Canada economically, physically, or emotionally than they would be in their own country. The claimant testified that her persecutor had family in Warsaw and knew the city well, as he used to work there. However, there was no evidence of a special relationship between Tadeusz and the police in Warsaw that would suggest she would not be accorded police protection if this was requested from Warsaw authorities. The panel concluded that the claimant had not proven that she was at risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment due to inadequate state protection in the potential IFA area. Accordingly, the panel found that under the circumstances it would not be objectively unreasonable for her to relocate to Warsaw.
[16]
The panel member then examined a "compelling reasons" submission of the applicant under section 108 of IRPA. She noted that subparagraph (1)(
e
) applied to cases in which a person would have been a refugee but the country conditions originally causing this no longer existed.. On that point, the panel concluded that there was no persuasive evidence that conditions in Poland had changed such that the "compelling reasons" exception should apply. The panel nonetheless examined the nature of the claimant's experiences. It determined that "atrocious" and "appalling" were terms defined in jurisprudence as "extremely savage or wicked" and "shocking, unpleasant". It decided that the facts in case at hand were not of the same order as the brutal circumstances related in jurisprudence which courts had found constituted a compelling exception.
[17]
The panel found that Ms. Czesak was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.
Issues
[18]
The applicant cited no less than six issues for the court to determine as follows:
(1) Did the panel err by failing to follow the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines?
(2) Did the panel err in determining that the applicant's delay in making the claim was a determinative issue, in light of the medical and psychological evidence?
(3) Did the panel err in finding that there is state protection for victims of domestic violence in Poland?
(4) Did the panel err in its IFA analysis?
(5) Did the panel err in finding section 108(4) to be not applicable?
(6) Did the panel err in failing to analyze the section 97 risk to the applicant?
Standard of review
[19]
The standard of review for all six issues is that of reasonableness. This denotes a deferential standard towards the decision-maker. The decision will be reasonable where the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 47).
Analysis
[20]
I find there to be only one serious issue of contention, relating to whether the IFA in Warsaw is reasonable in light of the applicant's particular circumstances and her very difficult medical condition.
[21]
With respect to the other submissions, firstly I reject the submission that the RPD ignored the Gender Guidelines. Specific reference was made to them and in the context of this case I am satisfied that the panel was sensitive to the factors which influence the testimony of the applicant who was a victim of persecution. The panel accepted that she was a victim of abuse and took that into full consideration. It was entitled nevertheless to make credibility findings, but in any event I do not conclude that these played a role in the decision. By and large, the particular circumstances of the claimant relate to her medical condition, which is determined by doctors' reports and the past living conditions of the claimant.
[22]
I also reject the applicant's contention that the panel erred in its analysis of state protection and IFA in its generalized aspect, apart from the remaining issue of its reasonableness given the applicant's medical condition. As noted, the panel carried out a careful analysis of the law and evidence on these issues. There was ample evidence to support its conclusions that state protection was available in Poland generally and that a reasonable IFA was available to the applicant in Warsaw in respect of her protection from persecution.
[23]
Similarly, I reject the applicant's arguments with respect to the applicability of subsection 108(4). There was no evidence of a change in country conditions. Additionally, the applicant's circumstances failed to meet the exceptional level of compelling reasons required for this provision. Similarly, the argument relating to the absence of a separate section 97 analysis is rejected. The panel's finding that the objective element of section 96 had not been met disposed of the section 97 issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Reasonableness of the IFA Given the Personal Circumstances of the Applicant
[24]
The applicant's counsel argues that it would be particularly unreasonable to remove Ms. Czesak to Warsaw in light of her precarious mental state as described by her doctors. This apprehension is related to concerns about a serious possibility of the applicant being persecuted no matter where she lived in Poland. The applicant argues that given her personal circumstances, it would be unreasonable for her to seek refuge in a place outside of the village where she had previously lived while residing in Poland.
[25]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Snider reiterated that domestic violence engages the Gender Guidelines and that an analysis needs to take into account the applicant's age, gender and personal circumstances in considering the reasonableness of an IFA.
[26]
Regarding state protection and an IFA in Warsaw, the panel concluded that state protection would be reasonably forthcoming, which as indicated I find an acceptable conclusion in the circumstances.
[27]
The panel also noted that the claimant had previously received social assistance and presumably could obtain the same in Warsaw. The applicant did not know whether she could find work to replace her income from summer farm work in her village, but she did not indicate that she could not work. In terms of support, the panel noted that the applicant was able to come to a foreign country and had little or no support from her family here. Given the freedom of movement within the country and her past mobility, the panel found that it would not be objectively unreasonable for her to relocate to another city, particularly Warsaw. I find this conclusion to be reasonable on the basis of the evidence before the panel.
[28]
However, the applicant takes particular exception to the panel's conclusion that the applicant's mental state as described by her doctors, did not make it unreasonable for her to relocate to Warsaw.
[29]
In its reasons, the panel accepted that the claimant was abused, but noted that psychological intervention could be accessed in Warsaw. Similarly, the panel expressly stated that it considered counsel's submissions, as well as the medical report of Dr. Durish, which it described as inconclusive, including with respect to a diagnosis of the applicant suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
[30]
The applicant claims that the panel was not transparent on this issue in that it relied upon one line of Dr. Durish's report while ignoring the totality of the report. Moreover, the panel's review of the medical evidence was limited to Dr. Durish's report. Significantly, it failed to mention or consider other medical reports, particularly that of Dr. Maria Koczorowska, a medical psychiatrist.
[31]
With regard to these allegations, I am satisfied that Dr. Durish's report may be described as inconclusive in respect of the applicant's psychological state in many regards, and not just in relation to her PTSD symptoms. The report speaks to concerns about significant substance abuse, and notes that the applicant somaticizes her trauma symptoms to a significant degree, as well as finding it very difficult to assess her intellectual functioning. It is noted that Dr. Durish's area of clinical expertise is in the assessment and treatment of trauma, for which she has received considerable postgraduate and professional training.
[32]
In relation to Dr. Koczorowska's report, it states that the applicant was initially seen commencing April 19, 2012. I find that the two-page report is considerably more categorical in its conclusions than Dr. Durish's report. Dr. Koczorowska describes the applicant as suffering from a severe psychomotor retardation with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder associated with general medical condition and psychological factors linked to post-concussion syndrome.
[33]
Moreover, Dr. Koczorowska specifically opines on the very issue of the applicant's removal to Poland, stating "I believe that she cannot return to Poland because it will
for sure
cause deterioration in his (sic) condition. ... Therefore
I fully support
her request to be granted permanent residence in Canada on humanitarian basis." [Emphasis added]
[34]
Medical reports from Dr. Stachula were also introduced into evidence. He initially treated the applicant in 2008 when she was involved in a motor vehicle accident. In his summary report of March 21, 2011, he noted that the applicant complained of low back pain and migraine headaches. He advised her to reduce her alcohol consumption because of headaches. He concluded that the patient definitely suffered from a grief reaction after her mother's death. His view was that her posttraumatic headaches related to her head injury. He states that she apparently was in good health before the accident, but after it took pain and anxiety medication regularly. No mention is made in his report of domestic violence, or domestic violence having contributed to her head injury issues.
[35]
It is to be noted that Dr. Koczorowska also indicated that the applicant was doing well until detained by immigration authorities and that her symptoms got worse after her mother died, since which time she had been struggling.
[36]
In light of the foregoing evidence, including that of Dr. Koczorowska, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for the panel to conclude that the evidence regarding the applicant's medical condition was inconclusive.
[37]
Moreover, I am of the view that decision-makers should be wary of reliance upon forensic expert evidence obtained for the purpose of litigation, unless it is subject to some form of validation. This remark would apply to the report of Dr. Koczorowska which went as far as to advocate on the applicant's behalf in the guise of an opinion on the very issue before the panel.
[38]
Our legal system has a long experience in dealing with forensic experts testifying on matters relating to technical evidence for the purpose of assisting courts in their determinations. From that experience, the courts have developed what I would describe as a guarded and cautionary view on conclusions of forensic experts which have not undergone a rigorous validation process under court procedures.
[39]
Some of these procedures intended to validate expert opinions include the early exchange of reports, by which I mean that normally there is a rebuttal report as a first line of validation. The parties are normally entitled to obtain extensive background information on the drafting of the reports, including production of correspondence between lawyers and experts and knowing whether there are other reports in existence not being relied upon. These procedures are further enhanced by the right to question opposing parties in discovery in relation to issues raised in reports. Most importantly, courts are provided the opportunity to assess the reliability of the expert opinions under cross-examination by competent lawyers, often under the direction of their own experts. In some cases, decision-makers will even involve neutral experts to assist resolution of more controversial points of opposing forensic experts.
[40]
This is not to say that every expert report prepared for litigation should be dismissed as having no, or little, weight. But what the court's experience with forensic experts does suggest in relation to these reports being proffered before administrative tribunals where there exists no defined procedure to allow for their validation, is that caution should be exercised in accepting them at face value, particularly when they propose to settle important issues to be decided by the tribunal. In my view therefore, unless there is some means to corroborate either the neutrality or lack of self interest of the expert in relation to the litigation process, they generally should be accorded little weight.
[41]
In this matter, the reports of Drs. Durish and Stachula I would think exhibit more of the required imprimatur of reliability, by the circumstances of the timing and of their involvement with the applicant and their more neutral and objective relation of conditions and guarded opinions that suggest reasonable limits on their diagnoses and prognoses of the applicant's condition.
[42]
I see no basis therefore, to uphold the applicant's complaint that the panel was selective or erred in failing to consider medical reports in reliance upon its conclusion that "it would not be unreasonable considering all the circumstances including those particular to the claimant for her to seek refuge in another city in Poland, particularly Warsaw".
[43]
Accordingly, the application is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[44]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application is dismissed, and no serious question of general importance is certified.

[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (LIPR) d'une décision rendue le 24 août 2012 par la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié, qui lui a refusé la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention et celle de personne à protéger en application des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande est rejetée.
Contexte factuel
[3]
La demanderesse est née en Pologne en 1958. La demanderesse s'est mariée en 1979 et trois enfants sont nés de cette union, qui a pris fin en 1988. La demanderesse a alors amorcé une relation avec Tadeusz Poniewierski, son conjoint de fait, avec qui elle a eu trois autres enfants. La relation avec M. Poniewierski était marquée par la violence. La demanderesse est toutefois demeurée avec lui jusqu'en 2006, malgré des blessures physiques, dont une fracture au nez, aux bras et aux jambes, ainsi que des problèmes avec une de ses oreilles.
[4]
La demanderesse a téléphoné à la police à de nombreuses reprises, mais les policiers lui ont seulement dit de régler elle-même ses problèmes conjugaux. Son deuxième conjoint élevait des pigeons avec le chef de police du village dans ses temps libres et buvait avec les autres policiers. Il a été arrêté une fois après l'avoir agressée, mais a été mis en liberté, celle-ci étant assortie d'une période de probation. La demanderesse a finalement mis fin à la relation avec lui, mais il est demeuré à proximité. Il a continué de faire de fréquentes visites à son domicile pour la harceler.
[5]
Mme Czesak a effectué une visite au Canada de septembre 2005 à mars 2006. Lorsqu'elle est rentrée en Pologne, son ex-conjoint l'a rejointe à l'aéroport de Varsovie, s'est introduit de force dans sa voiture et s'est rendu avec elle à son domicile. Il a donné des coups de poing dans la porte et les fenêtres, il a frappé son fils et il a poussé la demanderesse dans l'escalier, ce qui lui a fait perdre connaissance.
[6]
La demanderesse a pris l'avion pour le Canada en juillet 2006 au moyen d'un autre visa de visiteur de six mois et elle n'a plus quitté le pays. Elle a d'abord obtenu une prorogation de son visa pour une autre période de six mois, mais elle affirme que sa famille l'a dissuadée de faire une autre demande de prorogation et lui a dit de rester illégalement au Canada. Sa famille ne satisfaisait pas aux critères financiers pour la parrainer.
[7]
La demanderesse n'a appris qu'elle pouvait faire une demande d'asile qu'après avoir été arrêtée par la police, apparemment pour avoir traversé illégalement la chaussée, et mise en détention par les autorités de l'immigration. Sa famille n'a pas versé un cautionnement, même si elle avait promis de le faire. La demanderesse est restée en détention pendant trois mois, jusqu'à ce que l'unité de cautionnement à Toronto finisse par l'aider. Tandis qu'elle se trouvait en détention, le Bureau du droit des réfugiés lui a donné des conseils et elle a présenté une demande d'asile le 7 octobre 2009.
[8]
Elle n'avait pas vu son ex-conjoint depuis 2006, mais elle a appris qu'il avait appelé sa mère au Canada en mai ou en juin 2009, car il la cherchait. Il continue de se rendre à son domicile en Pologne et menace les membres de sa famille qui s'y trouvent. Elle a rassemblé certains documents témoignant des problèmes, mais son ex-conjoint les a volés dans la maison. Elle a demandé à ses enfants toujours en Pologne et au tuteur de son plus jeune enfant de mettre la main sur les documents, mais ils n'ont pas réussi. Elle a présenté des éléments de preuve relatifs à une décision du tribunal de la famille rendue en 2009 qui mettait fin aux droits parentaux de M. Poniewierski et de la demanderesse à l'égard de leurs enfants. La conseil de la demanderesse a envoyé au moins quatre demandes en Pologne, en anglais et traduites en polonais, ainsi que des formulaires de consentement signés, qui n'ont pas donné lieu à l'envoi d'autres documents.
[9]
Mme Czesak se trouve maintenant dans une situation difficile à Toronto, et un travailleur social qui l'a évaluée à la clinique Barbara Schlifer a conclu qu'elle était renfermée et possiblement traumatisée. Les évaluations des médecins font état de maux au dos, de maux de tête post-traumatiques, de pertes de mémoire, de pertes de connaissance, de dépression et d'une possible dépendance à l'alcool.
Décision contestée
[10]
À l'audience, le tribunal a admis que Mme Czesak avait été « maltraitée sur une longue période pendant son second mariage » et a souligné qu'il avait tenu compte des directives intitulées
Revendicatrices du statut de réfugié craignant d'être persécutées en raison de leur sexe
données par le président (les directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe), ainsi que des rapports médicaux, pour prendre en considération les trous de mémoire et l'incapacité de se concentrer. Les questions déterminantes étaient la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile, la protection de l'État et la possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI).
[11]
Le tribunal a conclu que la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile ne correspondait pas à la situation d'une personne qui vit dans la crainte de subir de la persécution dans son pays, de laquelle on s'attendrait à ce qu'elle demande l'asile le plus tôt possible. La famille de la demanderesse a donné à celle-ci un mauvais conseil sans aucun scrupule, mais la demanderesse était cependant consciente de sa situation illégale et elle n'a rien fait pour régulariser sa situation. Le tribunal a tiré une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse. Il ne m'apparaît toutefois pas que le refus du statut de réfugié est fondé sur la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile ou sur la crédibilité de la demanderesse en général.
[12]
Le tribunal a examiné les dispositions législatives et les éléments de preuve soumis par la demanderesse au sujet de la protection de l'État. Il a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants pour réfuter la présomption selon laquelle la Pologne était incapable d'assurer la protection des citoyens. Le tribunal a fait un examen approfondi de la preuve portant sur le manque de protection de l'État, constatant que la Pologne déployait des efforts importants afin de protéger les femmes, particulièrement depuis qu'elle s'était jointe à l'Union européenne, et que des éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants montraient que ces efforts étaient adéquats. La Pologne a adopté une loi visant à lutter contre la violence familiale (
Act on Counteracting Violence in the Family
) le 5 novembre 2005. Des poursuites ont été intentées contre des personnes accusées de violence conjugale qui pouvaient être condamnées à une peine d'emprisonnement maximale de cinq ans, même si les sentences étaient généralement moins lourdes. Le nombre de demandes déposées par les victimes augmentait chaque année. Selon les dernières données statistiques de 2007, la police aurait procédé à 81 403 interventions liées à la violence familiale. Le ministère de la Justice a affirmé que, de ce nombre, 15 404 personnes ont été reconnues coupables, et, à la fin de l'année, 4 500 personnes purgeaient des peines d'emprisonnement pour des crimes relatifs à la violence familiale, ce qui montre que le pays pose des gestes pour combattre la criminalité.
[13]
L'inconduite policière était un problème, mais des mesures étaient aussi prises pour y remédier. Le tribunal a fait référence à des preuves documentaires selon lesquelles les policiers semblaient parfois réticents à intervenir dans les incidents de violence familiale et que la protection offerte aux femmes victimes de mauvais traitements était parfois insuffisante. Toutefois, la Pologne s'efforçait d'améliorer la capacité d'intervention de la police, et même si la conseil avait présenté des comptes rendus publiés par Amnesty International, Freedom House, le centre d'action policière de l'Europe contre la violence faite aux femmes et le Comité pour l'élimination de la discrimination à l'égard des femmes des Nations unies, ces documents dataient de cinq à sept ans. Le tribunal a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait fourni aucun élément de preuve convaincant montrant que son ex-conjoint avait des relations parmi les policiers qui auraient pu empêcher la demanderesse de se prévaloir de la protection de l'État.
[14]
Le tribunal n'a pas admis l'explication que la demanderesse a donnée au fait qu'elle avait attendu juste avant le début de l'audience pour demander des copies de documents de la police, ou son explication selon laquelle certains rapports ne pouvaient être fournis parce que les policiers changeaient d'emploi, ou son allégation selon laquelle M. Poniewierski avait volé des documents qui se trouvaient dans la maison quand il s'était rendu compte qu'elle voulait rester au Canada. Le tribunal a également conclu qu'il n'était pas raisonnable que la demanderesse ait attendu jusqu'à deux semaines avant l'audience pour obtenir des documents médicaux, lorsqu'elle avait déposé sa demande d'asile en 2009.
[15]
Le tribunal a ensuite considéré la ville de Varsovie, située de 300 à 400 kilomètres de l'ancien lieu de résidence de Mme Czesak en Pologne, comme une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI). Le tribunal a encore une fois passé en revue l'abondante jurisprudence en matière de PRI, et souligné entre autres le caractère insuffisant des arguments selon lesquels les demandeurs n'avaient pas d'amis ou de parenté dans la région, ou pourraient ne pas y trouver de travail qui leur convienne, ou pourraient se trouver mieux au Canada que dans leur propre pays sur les plans économique, physique ou affectif. La demanderesse a déclaré dans son témoignage que l'homme qui la persécutait avait de la famille à Varsovie et connaissait très bien la ville étant donné qu'il y avait travaillé. Cependant, aucun élément de preuve ne montrait qu'il existait une relation spéciale entre Tadeusz et la police à Varsovie qui aurait laissé croire que la demanderesse ne pourrait se prévaloir de la protection de la police si les autorités de Varsovie le demandaient. Le tribunal a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas prouvé qu'elle serait exposée à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités en raison de la protection de l'État insuffisante dans la région désignée comme PRI. Le tribunal a donc conclu que, dans les circonstances, il ne serait pas objectivement déraisonnable que la demanderesse déménage à Varsovie.
[16]
Le tribunal a ensuite examiné les observations au sujet des « raisons impérieuses » présentées par la demanderesse en application de l'article 108 de la LIPR. Il a constaté que l'alinéa (1)
e
) s'appliquait aux situations où une personne aurait pu avoir qualité de réfugié, mais où les conditions ayant mené à cette conclusion n'existaient plus. Sur ce point, le tribunal a conclu qu'il n'existait aucun élément de preuve convaincant montrant que les conditions en Pologne avaient changé à tel point qu'il était justifié d'invoquer des « raisons impérieuses ». Le tribunal a néanmoins examiné la nature des expériences de la demanderesse. Il a conclu que les qualificatifs « atroce » et « épouvantable » se rapportaient dans la jurisprudence à la persécution étant « extrêmement sauvage ou pernicieuse » et « choquante et troublante ». Selon le tribunal, les faits de l'espèce n'étaient pas du même ordre que les circonstances brutales décrites dans la jurisprudence qui étaient considérées comme une exception impérieuse selon les tribunaux.
[17]
Le tribunal a conclu que Mme Czesak n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger.
Questions en litige
[18]
La demanderesse a cité pas moins de six questions que la Cour devrait trancher, soit les suivantes:
(1) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur en ne suivant pas les directives du président concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe?
(2) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur en concluant que la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile par la demanderesse était une question déterminante, à la lumière des éléments de preuve d'ordre médical et psychologique?
(3) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur en concluant que la protection de l'État est offerte aux victimes de violence familiale en Pologne?
(4) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur dans sa manière d'analyser la PRI?
(5) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur en concluant que le paragraphe 108(4) n'était pas applicable?
(6) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur en omettant d'analyser le risque prévu à l'article 97 pour la demanderesse?
Norme de contrôle
[19]
La norme de contrôle applicable aux six questions est celle de la décision raisonnable. Il s'agit d'une norme déférente à l'égard du décideur. La décision sera considérée comme raisonnable si elle appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47).
Analyse
[20]
Je conclus qu'il n'y a qu'un point litigieux important, qui a trait à la question de savoir si la PRI à Varsovie est raisonnable à la lumière de la situation particulière de la demanderesse et de ses graves problèmes de santé.
[21]
En ce qui concerne les autres observations, tout d'abord, je rejette celle selon laquelle la SPR n'a pas tenu compte des directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe. Des références précises y ont été faites et, dans le contexte de la présente affaire, je suis convaincu que le tribunal a été sensible aux facteurs qui influent sur le témoignage de la demanderesse qui a été victime de persécution. Le tribunal a accepté qu'elle était victime de maltraitance et il a pleinement tenu compte de ce fait. Il lui était cependant loisible de tirer des conclusions quant à la crédibilité, mais je ne conclus toutefois pas que celles-ci ont joué un rôle dans la décision. De façon générale, les circonstances particulières de la demanderesse se rapportent à ses problèmes de santé, qui ont été établis par les rapports des médecins et qui découlent des conditions dans lesquelles la demanderesse a vécu dans le passé.
[22]
Je rejette également l'allégation de la demanderesse selon laquelle le tribunal a commis une erreur dans sa manière d'analyser la protection de l'État et la PRI de façon générale, indépendamment de la question de son caractère raisonnable qui demeure étant donné les problèmes de santé de la demanderesse. Comme il a été mentionné, le tribunal a effectué une analyse minutieuse de la jurisprudence et des éléments de preuve sur ces questions. De nombreux éléments de preuve appuyaient ses conclusions selon lesquelles la protection de l'État était généralement offerte en Pologne et qu'une PRI raisonnable était offerte à la demanderesse à Varsovie, où elle serait protégée de la persécution.
[23]
De même, je rejette les arguments de la demanderesse portant sur l'applicabilité du paragraphe 108(4). Aucun élément de preuve ne permettait de penser que la situation dans le pays avait changé. De plus, la situation de la demanderesse ne revêtait pas le caractère exceptionnel permettant d'invoquer des raisons impérieuses requis pour cette disposition. Dans un même ordre d'idées, l'argument relatif à l'absence d'une analyse distincte fondée sur l'article 97 est rejeté. La conclusion du tribunal selon laquelle l'élément objectif de l'article 96 n'avait pas été satisfait a permis de régler la question relative à l'article 97.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Caractère raisonnable de la PRI eu égard à la situation personnelle de la demanderesse
[24]
La conseil de la demanderesse fait valoir qu'il serait particulièrement déraisonnable de renvoyer Mme Czesak à Varsovie compte tenu de son état mental précaire, tel que décrit par ses médecins, notamment en raison de la possibilité sérieuse que la demanderesse soit persécutée où qu'elle vive en Pologne. La demanderesse allègue que, compte tenu de sa situation personnelle, il serait déraisonnable pour elle de chercher refuge ailleurs que dans le village où elle avait auparavant vécu lorsqu'elle habitait la Pologne.
[25]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Snider a réitéré que la violence familiale fait intervenir les directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe et qu'une analyse portant sur le caractère raisonnable d'une PRI doit tenir compte de l'âge, du sexe et de la situation personnelle du demandeur.
[26]
En ce qui concerne la protection de l'État et une PRI à Varsovie, le tribunal a conclu que la protection de l'État serait raisonnablement offerte, ce qui, comme je l'ai affirmé, m'apparaît être une conclusion raisonnable dans les circonstances.
[27]
Le tribunal a également constaté que la demanderesse avait déjà reçu des prestations d'aide sociale et qu'elle pourrait probablement recevoir des prestations de même nature à Varsovie. La demanderesse ne savait pas si elle pourrait trouver dans son village un emploi qui lui permettrait d'obtenir un revenu équivalent à celui qu'elle gagnait en travaillant à des fermes pendant l'été, mais elle n'a pas précisé qu'elle ne pourrait pas travailler. En ce qui concerne le soutien, le tribunal a fait remarquer que la demanderesse pouvait se rendre dans un pays étranger et qu'elle avait peu de soutien de sa famille ici ou qu'elle n'en avait aucun. Étant donné la liberté de circulation au sein du pays et les déplacements antérieurs de la demanderesse, le tribunal a conclu qu'il ne serait pas objectivement déraisonnable pour elle de s'installer dans une autre ville, particulièrement à Varsovie. J'estime que cette conclusion est raisonnable compte tenu de la preuve dont le tribunal disposait.
[28]
Cependant, la demanderesse conteste particulièrement la conclusion du tribunal selon laquelle il n'était pas déraisonnable qu'elle se réinstalle à Varsovie malgré son état mental, tel que décrit par ses médecins.
[29]
Dans ses motifs, le tribunal a admis que la demanderesse avait été maltraitée, mais qu'elle pourrait obtenir de l'aide psychologique à Varsovie. De même, le tribunal a expressément affirmé qu'il avait tenu compte des observations de la conseil, ainsi que du rapport médical de la Dre Durish, qu'il avait jugé non concluant, notamment parce qu'il ne permettait pas de poser un diagnostic d'état de stress post-traumatique (ESPT) chez la demanderesse.
[30]
La demanderesse affirme que le tribunal n'a pas fait preuve de transparence sur cette question, car il a fait abstraction de la totalité du rapport pour se fonder sur une seule phrase de celui-ci. De plus, le tribunal a limité son examen de la preuve d'ordre médical au rapport de la Dre Durish. Fait à noter, elle n'a pas mentionné ou tenu compte d'autres rapports médicaux, notamment celui de la Dre Maria Koczorowska, une psychiatre.
[31]
En ce qui concerne ces allégations, je suis convaincu que le rapport de la Dre Durish pourrait être jugé non concluant sur la question de l'état psychologique de la demanderesse à de nombreux égards, et non uniquement en ce qui a trait à ses symptômes d'ESPT. Le rapport fait état de préoccupations relatives à une consommation importante de substances, précise que la demanderesse somatise les symptômes de son traumatisme dans une large mesure et indique qu'il est très difficile d'évaluer son fonctionnement intellectuel. Il y est observé que les domaines d'expertise clinique de la Dre Durish sont l'évaluation et le traitement des traumatismes, dans lesquels elle a effectué des études supérieures et une formation professionnelle poussées.
[32]
Quant au rapport de la Dre Koczorowska, il y est écrit que la première consultation avec la demanderesse remonte au 19 avril 2012. J'estime que le rapport de deux pages renferme des conclusions autrement plus catégoriques que le rapport de la Dre Durish. La Dre Koczorowska explique dans son rapport que la demanderesse souffre d'un retard psychomoteur grave et pose un diagnostic de trouble dépressif majeur et d'état de stress post-traumatique associé à un état pathologique général, et relie certains facteurs psychologiques à un syndrome post-commotion cérébrale.
[33]
En outre, la Dre Koczorowska s'exprime sur la question précise du renvoi de la demanderesse en Pologne, affirmant ce qui suit: [traduction] « Je crois qu'elle ne peut pas retourner en Pologne, parce que ce retour entraînerait
assurément
la détérioration de son état ... Par conséquent,
j'appuie entièrement
sa demande de résidence permanente au Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. » [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[34]
Les rapports médicaux du Dr Stachula ont également été présentés en preuve. Celui-ci a d'abord traité la demanderesse en 2008 lorsqu'elle a été impliquée dans un accident d'automobile. Dans son rapport sommaire du 21 mars 2011, il a noté que la demanderesse se plaignait de douleur au bas du dos et de migraines. Il lui a conseillé de réduire sa consommation d'alcool pour atténuer ses migraines. Il a conclu que la patiente vivait incontestablement un deuil à la suite du décès de sa mère. Selon lui, ses céphalées post-traumatiques étaient liées à son traumatisme crânien. Il affirme qu'elle était apparemment en bonne santé avant l'accident, mais qu'elle s'était mise à prendre des analgésiques et des anxiolytiques régulièrement après coup. Son rapport ne fait aucunement état de violence familiale ou de la possibilité que la violence familiale ait pu jouer un rôle dans son problème de traumatisme crânien.
[35]
Il convient de noter que la Dre Koczorowska a également indiqué que la demanderesse se portait bien avant d'être détenue par les autorités de l'immigration et que ses symptômes s'étaient aggravés après le décès de sa mère, depuis lequel elle éprouvait des problèmes.
[36]
À la lumière des éléments de preuve qui précèdent, dont ceux de la Dre Koczorowska, je suis convaincu qu'il était raisonnable pour le tribunal de conclure que la preuve relative aux problèmes de santé de la demanderesse n'était pas concluante.
[37]
De plus, j'estime que les décideurs ne devraient se fier qu'avec prudence aux éléments de preuve des experts judiciaires obtenus aux fins du litige, sauf s'ils font l'objet d'une certaine forme de validation. Cette remarque vise le rapport de la Dre Koczorowska, qui est allée jusqu'à intervenir en la faveur de la demanderesse en formulant un avis sur la question précisément débattue devant le tribunal.
[38]
Notre système juridique a une longue expérience des relations avec les experts judiciaires qui témoignent sur des questions relatives à des éléments de preuve techniques pour aider les tribunaux à rendre leurs décisions. Forts de cette expérience, les tribunaux ont, me semble-t-il, appris à jauger avec prudence et circonspection les conclusions des experts judiciaires qui n'ont pas fait l'objet d'un processus de validation rigoureux dans le cadre de procédures judiciaires.
[39]
Les procédures de validation des opinions d'experts peuvent comprendre l'échange de rapports tôt dans le processus, un rapport étant normalement présenté en contre-preuve aux fins de la validation initiale. En règle générale, les parties ont le droit d'obtenir des renseignements détaillés sur le contexte factuel de la rédaction des rapports, relatifs entre autres à la production de la correspondance entre les avocats et les experts, et elles ont le droit de savoir s'il existe d'autres rapports qui ne sont pas pris en compte. À cela s'ajoute le droit d'interroger les parties adverses lors de l'interrogatoire préalable au sujet des questions soulevées dans les rapports. Plus important encore, les tribunaux ont la possibilité de faire évaluer la fiabilité des opinions des experts obtenues en contre-interrogatoire par des avocats compétents, souvent sous la direction de leurs propres experts. Dans certains cas, les décideurs font même intervenir des experts neutres pour aider à trancher des questions plus controversées opposant les experts judiciaires des deux parties.
[40]
Il ne s'ensuit pas que tout rapport d'expert rédigé aux fins du litige doive être rejeté au motif qu'il n'aurait pas beaucoup de poids, sinon aucun. Ce que la Cour a plutôt retenu de son expérience avec les experts judiciaires, relativement à la production de rapports devant des tribunaux administratifs en l'absence de procédure de validation définie, est la nécessité d'exercer une grande prudence avant d'accepter les rapports sans réserve, particulièrement lorsqu'ils seraient de nature à trancher des questions importantes en litige devant la Cour. Par conséquent, selon moi, à moins qu'il ne soit possible de garantir la neutralité ou l'absence d'intérêt personnel de l'expert dans le cadre du litige, il convient généralement de leur accorder peu de poids.
[41]
En l'espèce, les rapports de la Dre Durish et du Dr Stachula me semblent répondre au critère de fiabilité requis, compte tenu du moment où ils ont été rédigés et de l'interaction de leurs auteurs avec la demanderesse, et parce que l'état de santé de la demanderesse y est dépeint avec une neutralité et une objectivité plus grandes et que les diagnostics et pronostics sont empreints d'une réserve raisonnable.
[42]
Il me semble donc que la demanderesse n'était aucunement fondée à affirmer que le tribunal a été sélectif à l'égard de la preuve ou a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte des rapports médicaux pour tirer sa conclusion selon laquelle « il ne serait pas déraisonnable pour la [demanderesse], compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances, y compris celles qui lui sont propres, de chercher refuge dans une autre ville de la Pologne, particulièrement à Varsovie ».
[43]
Par conséquent, la demande est rejetée.
