Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Mactavish, J.
: Abdul Khalil Aleaf and his family applied for permanent residence in Canada as privately-sponsored members of the Convention Refugee Class or Country of Asylum Class. Their application was refused because a visa officer at the Canadian High Commission in Pakistan found Mr. Aleaf not to be credible, with the result that he had not established that he and his family would be at risk in Afghanistan. The officer made no finding that Mr. Aleaf was inadmissible to Canada on security grounds.
[2]
The applicants seek judicial review of the visa officer's decision, asserting that they were treated unfairly in the visa process because Mr. Aleaf was not provided with copies of Canada Border Services Agency and Canadian Security Intelligence Service memos from 2006, nor was he given a copy of a "poison pen" letter that had been sent to the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad in 2005.
[3]
The applicants also say that it was unreasonable for the officer to find that Mr. Aleaf's story was not credible, and that the visa officer further erred by failing to consider the gender-based persecution that Mr. Aleaf's wife and daughter would face in Afghanistan. Finally, the applicants contend that there are "special circumstances" in this case (including the inordinate delay in the processing of their visa application) that justify an order of costs in their favour.
[4]
I have not been persuaded that the applicants were treated unfairly in this matter. I am also satisfied that it was reasonable for the visa officer to find that Mr. Aleaf's explanation regarding his whereabouts in the late 1990s was not credible. No gender-based claim was advanced by or on behalf of Mr. Aleaf's wife and daughter, and consequently there was no obligation on the visa officer to address this issue. Finally, while there was undoubtedly a lengthy and ultimately unexplained delay in the processing of the applicants' visa application, I am not persuaded that this constitutes "special circumstances" justifying an award of costs in their favour.
I.
Background
[5]
Mr. Aleaf's family comes from a village in Logar province in Afghanistan. Mr. Aleaf says that sometime around 1992, the family became embroiled in a property dispute with cousins, who had laid claim to the family's property. The cousins allegedly had ties to the Taliban, and threatened to kill the family if they did not give up their claim to the property.
[6]
In 1995, the family was living in Kabul when Mr. Aleaf's parents' house was destroyed by a rocket attack. Mr. Aleaf was not at home at the time, although other family members were in the house. Most of the family escaped the blast, after which they returned to live in their village. The family asked village elders to help them reacquire their land, but their relatives resorted to violent threats and the family was unable to recover their property.
[7]
Mr. Aleaf's parents and five of his siblings fled to Pakistan in 1997, and came to Canada in 2000 as privately-sponsored refugees. Mr. Aleaf says that he stayed in Afghanistan until 1998, and then moved to Pakistan where he remains to this day. The visa officer did not find Mr. Aleaf's account of his whereabouts between 1995 and 1998 to be credible.
[8]
Although there was a suggestion that Mr. Aleaf may have originally been part of his parents' application for refugee protection, he was not included in the decision granting permanent residence to his family. Mr. Aleaf filed his own application for permanent residence in 2004. He was interviewed in 2005, following which a visa officer made a positive selection decision. The Canadian High Commission in Pakistan then received adverse information regarding Mr. Aleaf, including CBSA and CSIS reports indicating that Mr. Aleaf had admitted to lying about his whereabouts in his application for permanent residence.
[9]
Mr. Aleaf had stated in his immigration application that he had lived in Kabul until 1998. However, the reports received by the High Commission stated that Mr. Aleaf had admitted in an interview that he had in fact been living in a series of refugee camps in Pakistan between 1996 and 1998, at least one of which was run by the Hizb-i-Islami Gulbuddin (HIG) as a refuge for their militants, supporters and families. The HIG is a highly volatile group that has been involved in attacks on the government of Afghanistan.
[10]
Mr. Aleaf amended his permanent residence application after getting married. He updated his immigration forms again in 2012 to include the couple's two children - a son and a daughter. Mr. Aleaf continued to assert in these updated forms that he was living in Kabul between 1995 and 1998.
[11]
It is unclear why the processing of the Aleaf family's application took so long, but we do know that the High Commission decided to interview Mr. Aleaf again in 2013. The High Commission was reassessing his case because of the length of time since the 2005 eligibility decision, and because many Afghans who had been living in Pakistan were now returning home.
[12]
Before reviewing the visa officer's record of the May 6, 2013 interview with Mr. Aleaf, it is important to note that Mr. Aleaf has not filed an affidavit in this proceeding. As a consequence, there is no evidence before me that would call into question the accuracy of the visa officer's record of what was said during the interview. Mr. Aleaf did provide an unsworn "statement" in which he takes issue with the officer's interpretation of the events discussed during the interview. He does not, however, point to any inaccuracies in the officer's notes.
II.
The 2013 Interview
[13]
Mr. Aleaf told the visa officer that he had a brother named Abdul Samay, who was "not a normal person", in that he was paralysed, blind, deaf and "dumb". This brother was allegedly in the family home in Kabul at the time of the rocket attack in 1995 and could not be found after the attack, which had totally destroyed the house.
[14]
Mr. Aleaf says that he and his family returned to their village in Logar after the rocket attack, where they lived for the next year, a claim that was not consistent with the address information that Mr. Aleaf had provided in his immigration forms.
[15]
The visa officer questioned the family's decision to return to their village, given that this was the location where the family's alleged agents of persecution were located. The officer also suggested to Mr. Aleaf that if his cousins were intent on harming the family, they would have done so in the year that the family spent in Logar. Mr. Aleaf did not provide a coherent response to this concern, leading the officer to question the story of the land dispute.
[16]
Mr. Aleaf told the visa officer that after spending a year in the village, he spent the next two years looking for his missing brother in various locations all over Afghanistan. The officer had difficulty with this claim, given that the family had not returned to Kabul to search for Abdul Samay's body in the ruins of their house, the place that he would more likely have been found. The officer could not understand why Mr. Aleaf thought that a severely disabled individual would have been able to survive a rocket attack, and then move to another part of Afghanistan.
[17]
Mr. Aleaf says that he did not accompany his family when they moved to Pakistan in 1997, claiming to have stayed behind in Afghanistan to continue searching for Abdul Samay. Given the indications that Abdul Samay had died in the 1995 rocket attack, the officer did not find Mr. Aleaf's claim to have spent years searching for his brother in Afghanistan to be plausible.
[18]
After moving to Pakistan in 1998, Mr. Aleaf says that he got a job at a plumber's shop in Peshawar, where he worked for the next 12 years. Mr. Aleaf could not, however, remember the name of the shop, and had no documentation to support his claim of long-term employment. Mr. Aleaf also stated that he lost his job in 2012 because the owner was "not good with Afghans". As the visa officer noted, it did not make sense that the owner would suddenly fire Mr. Aleaf after 12 years of employment because he was "not good with Afghans".
[19]
These concerns led the visa officer to make a general finding that Mr. Aleaf was simply not credible. The officer was not satisfied that Mr. Aleaf would be at risk in Afghanistan, and found that he could live safely in Kabul.
III.
Was Mr. Aleaf Treated Unfairly in the Visa Process?
[20]
Mr. Aleaf's first argument is that he was treated unfairly in the visa process because he was not provided with copies of the CBSA and CSIS memos from 2006, or with the "poison pen" letter received by the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad in 2005.
[21]
Where an issue of procedural fairness arises, the Court's task is to determine whether the process followed by the decision-maker satisfied the level of fairness required in all of the circumstances: see
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
As I noted in my decision declining to appoint a special advocate to represent Mr. Aleaf's interests in section 87 proceedings brought in this matter, I accept that this matter is undoubtedly of great importance to Mr. Aleaf and his family, given that they were seeking permission enter to Canada as refugees. I have not, however, been persuaded that the family was treated unfairly, in all of the circumstances.
[23]
Insofar as the two government memos are concerned, Mr. Aleaf argues that there is no record of an interview in the Certified Tribunal Record in which he admitted to lying about his whereabouts in his application for permanent residence. The difficulty with this submission is that Mr. Aleaf has not denied making the statement attributed to him.
[24]
As noted earlier, Mr. Aleaf did not file an affidavit in support of his application for judicial review, and his unsworn statement does not address this issue. Consequently, there is no evidence before me that Mr. Aleaf did not make the statement that was attributed to him. Nor is there evidence that Mr. Aleaf was unaware of the contents of the memos, or that he was prejudiced in any way by their non-disclosure. He has, moreover, not identified any evidence that he could have produced to counter the information contained in the reports, had he been aware of their existence.
[25]
There is also no indication in the visa officer's reasons that any weight was attributed to the information contained in the memos. The officer's decision was based on the inherent implausibility of Mr. Aleaf's story of his multi-year search for his missing brother in various regions of Afghanistan during a period that he had claimed to have been living in Kabul.
[26]
Insofar as the poison pen letter is concerned, the jurisprudence of this Court has commented on the inherent unreliability of such communications:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 15, 321 F.T.R. 315. There is, however, nothing in the visa officer's decision to indicate that the officer was aware of the contents of the 2005 letter, or that any consideration was given to the letter by the officer. Indeed, the officer's notes specifically state that "adverse information" that had been received in 2005 regarding Mr. Aleaf was "not on the file, or outlined in CAIPS". The decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 61, relied upon by the applicants is therefore distinguishable: see paras. 30-32.
[27]
The visa officer's notes of the 2013 interview confirm that the officer explicitly told Mr. Aleaf that she was concerned about Mr. Aleaf's whereabouts between 1995 and 1998, and gave Mr. Aleaf ample opportunity to respond to those concerns. No breach of procedural fairness has thus been established in this case.
IV.
The Reasonableness of the Officer's Credibility Findings
[28]
The applicants submit that the officer's credibility findings were unreasonable, as the officer failed to appreciate that Mr. Aleaf had
two
disabled brothers, Abdul Samay and Tawab. According to Mr. Aleaf's unsworn statement and the affidavit of his father, Tawab was killed in the rocket attack in 1995, but Abdul Samay survived the attack and went missing.
[29]
The difficulty with this argument is that there is no evidence before me to indicate that the officer was ever made aware of this claim. Mr. Aleaf's father was not in attendance at the interview with the visa officer, and is thus not in a position to comment on what transpired at the interview. While Mr. Aleaf asserts in his statement that the officer did not seem to understand that he had two disabled brothers, nowhere in his statement does he indicate that he informed the officer of this fact.
[30]
The story that Mr. Aleaf told to the visa officer as to where he was in the years between 1995 and 1998 was confusing, convoluted and improbable. The officer's finding that Mr. Aleaf was not credible is amply supported by the record and no basis has been shown for this Court to intervene.
V.
The Basis of Claim
[31]
The applicants also say that the visa officer erred by failing to attach sufficient weight to the fact that Canadian immigration authorities had accepted Mr. Aleaf's parents and siblings as refugees in 2000, and that a positive selection decision had been made in relation to Mr. Aleaf himself in 2005.
[32]
It is, however, apparent from the visa officer's reasons that she was well aware of the history of the family's refugee claims, including the fact that Canadian immigration authorities had accepted the story of the land dispute in 2000. However, each refugee claim has to be determined on its own merits.
[33]
We do not know what evidence was before the visa officer deciding the family's claim in 2000, nor do we know how the evidence adduced in support of the applicants' claims differed from that in Mr. Aleaf's parents and siblings' claim. We do know that the visa officer in this case found that the Aleaf family's decision to return to their village in 1995 after the destruction of their house in Kabul was inconsistent with them having a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of their relatives in Logar province. That was a finding that was reasonably open to the officer on the record before her.
[34]
Moreover, the applicants' refugee claim was assessed in 2013, when conditions in Afghanistan were quite different than they were in 2000.
[35]
Unlike the situation that confronted the Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 1556, the visa officer clearly explained why she did not accept Mr. Aleaf's claim to be at risk in Afghanistan. Mr. Aleaf has thus established no basis for this Court's intervention on this ground.
VI.
The Failure to Consider a Gender-Based Claim
[36]
The applicants' final argument is that the visa officer erred by failing to consider the gender-based persecution that Mr. Aleaf's wife and daughter would face in Afghanistan. The difficulty with this argument is that no such claim was asserted by the family in their application for permanent residence. The claims of Mr. Aleaf's wife and children were entirely dependant on his claim, which was based on the alleged land dispute.
[37]
It is true that in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court confirmed that the Board must consider
all of the grounds
for making a claim to refugee status, even if the grounds are not raised during a hearing by a claimant, and that it is not the duty of a claimant to identify the reasons for their persecution: see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 6. This assessment must, however, be made on the facts as asserted by the claimants.
[38]
The applicant in
Ward
had claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Ireland as a result of a particular series of events. Although the claim was originally based on the applicant's membership in a particular social group, the Supreme Court concluded that the events in issue actually gave rise to a claim based upon political opinion, and should be considered no that basis.
[39]
In this case, the only events that were alleged to give rise to a subjective fear of persecution in Afghanistan on the part of the applicants, including Mr. Aleaf's wife and daughter, were the events relating to the land dispute. There was no suggestion that this dispute related in any way to the gender of Mr. Aleaf's wife and daughter, and the officer thus did not err in failing to address a gender-based claim:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 25, [2008] F.C.J. No. 986;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 11, [2009] F.C.J. No. 847.
[40]
The fact that country condition information indicates that violence against women is a serious problem in Afghanistan is not an adequate basis for a positive determination of a refugee claim:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 17, 413 F.T.R. 122.
[41]
The applicants cite three other cases as support for their contention that the visa officer had a duty to consider a gender-based claim, even though no such claim had been advanced by the applicants. These cases do not, however, support the applicants' position. In both
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 320 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 4 and 34, [2014] F.C.J. No. 736, refugee decisions were set aside because of a failure to consider an independent claim that had been
expressly asserted
by the spouse of the principal applicant.
[42]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 271, the Court noted that overseas refugee claimants have no right to an interview, but that there may be cases where it is necessary to interview a co-applicant, where, for example, the credibility of the principal applicant is in issue. There is, however, no suggestion that Mr. Aleaf's wife had any first-hand knowledge of the alleged land dispute. Nor is there any suggestion that she had any first-hand knowledge of Mr. Aleaf's whereabouts between 1995 and 1998, a period that pre-dated their marriage by several years. She has not filed an affidavit in this matter, and there is nothing before me to indicate that she could have shed any light on the situation.
VII.
Costs
[43]
The applicants also submit that there are "special circumstances" in this case (including the inordinate delay in the processing of their visa application) that would justify an order of costs in their favour.
[44]
Costs are not ordinarily awarded in immigration proceedings in this Court. Rule 22 of the
Federal Courts
Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules
, SOR/93-22 provides that "No costs shall be awarded to or payable by any party in respect of an application for leave, an application for judicial review or an appeal under these Rules unless the Court, for special reasons, so orders".
[45]
The threshold for establishing the existence of "special reasons" is high, and each case will turn on its own particular circumstances:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 8, 68 Imm. L.R. (3d) 43. The applicants have not persuaded me that "special reasons" exist in this case that would justify an order of costs, and I decline to make such an order.
VIII.
Conclusion
[46]
For these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed. I agree with the parties that the case does not raise a question for certification.
JUDGMENT
[47]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. This application for judicial review is dismissed.
.........................
Abdul Khalil Aleaf, Raihana Aleaf, Tayeba Aleaf et Abdul Saboor Aleaf (représentés par leur tuteur à l'instance,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Abdul Khalil Aleaf et sa famille ont présenté une demande de résidence permanente au Canada au titre du parrainage privé dans la catégorie des réfugiés au sens de la Convention ou la catégorie des personnes de pays d'accueil. Leur demande a été rejetée parce qu'une agente des visas au haut-commissariat du Canada au Pakistan a conclu que M. Aleaf n'était pas crédible, et qu'il n'avait donc pas établi que sa famille et lui seraient exposés au risque en Afghanistan. L'agente n'a pas conclu que M. Aleaf était interdit de territoire au Canada pour des motifs liés à la sécurité.
[2]
Les demandeurs sollicitent le contrôle judiciaire de la décision de l'agente des visas, ils affirment qu'ils ont été traités de manière inéquitable dans le processus de demande de visa parce que M. Aleaf n'a pas obtenu de copies des notes de service de 2006 de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l'ASFC) et du Service canadien du renseignement de sécurité (le SCRS) et il n'a pas non plus reçu de copie d'une lettre de dénonciation qui avait été envoyée au haut-commissariat du Canada à Islamabad en 2005.
[3]
Les demandeurs affirment aussi qu'il était déraisonnable que l'agente conclue que le récit de M. Aleaf n'était pas crédible, et que l'agente des visas a commis une autre erreur en omettant de tenir compte de la persécution fondée sur le sexe à laquelle l'épouse et la fille de M. Aleaf seraient exposées en Afghanistan. Enfin, les demandeurs soutiennent qu'il y a des [traduction] « circonstances spéciales » en l'espèce (notamment le délai anormalement long de traitement de leur demande de visa) qui justifient qu'une ordonnance leur adjugeant les dépens soit rendue.
[4]
La Cour n'a pas été convaincue que les demandeurs ont été traités de manière inéquitable en l'espèce. La Cour est aussi d'avis qu'il était raisonnable que l'agente des visas conclue que l'explication de M. Aleaf quant à savoir où il se trouvait à la fin des années 1990 n'était pas crédible. Aucune revendication fondée sur le sexe n'a été formulée par l'épouse et la fille de M. Aleaf ni pour leur compte, et par conséquent, l'agente des visas n'avait pas l'obligation de traiter de cette question. Enfin, bien que le délai de traitement de la demande de visa des demandeurs ait indubitablement été long et n'ait jamais été expliqué, la Cour n'est pas d'avis que cela constitue des [traduction] « circonstances spéciales » justifiant une adjudication de dépens en leur faveur.
I.
Le contexte
[5]
La famille de M. Aleaf vient d'un village de la province de Logar en Afghanistan. M. Aleaf dit que vers 1992, la famille a été entraînée dans un différend foncier avec des cousins, qui revendiquaient des droits sur la propriété de la famille. Les cousins auraient eu des liens avec les talibans, et ils auraient menacé de tuer la famille si celle-ci ne renonçait pas à ses droits sur la propriété.
[6]
En 1995, la famille vivait à Kaboul lorsque la maison des parents de M. Aleaf a été détruite par une attaque à la roquette. M. Aleaf n'était pas à la maison à ce moment-là, mais d'autres membres de la famille s'y trouvaient. La plupart des membres de la famille ont échappé à l'explosion, après cela, ils sont retournés vivre dans leur village. La famille a demandé aux aînés du village de les aider à reprendre leur terre, mais leurs parents ont proféré de violentes menaces à leur endroit, et la famille n'a pas été en mesure de récupérer sa propriété.
[7]
Les parents de M. Aleaf et cinq de ses frères et sœurs ont fui au Pakistan en 1997, et ils sont venus au Canada en 2000 au titre du parrainage privé des réfugiés. M. Aleaf affirme qu'il est resté en Afghanistan jusqu'en 1998, et ensuite, il a déménagé au Pakistan, où il est demeuré jusqu'à présent. L'agente des visas a estimé que le récit de M. Aleaf quant à savoir où il était entre 1995 et 1998 n'était pas crédible.
[8]
Bien qu'une hypothèse ait été formulée selon laquelle, M. Aleaf faisait peut-être partie de la demande d'asile originale de ses parents, il n'a pas été inclus dans la décision accordant la résidence permanente à sa famille. M. Aleaf a déposé sa propre demande de résidence permanente en 2004. Il a été interviewé en 2005, ensuite, un agent des visas a rendu une décision favorable quant à la sélection. Le haut-commissariat du Canada au Pakistan a ensuite reçu des renseignements défavorables concernant M. Aleaf, notamment des rapports de l'ASFC et du SCRS dont il ressortait que M. Aleaf avait admis avoir fait de fausses déclarations quant à savoir où il était dans sa demande de résidence permanente.
[9]
Dans sa demande d'immigration, M. Aleaf a affirmé qu'il avait vécu à Kaboul jusqu'en 1998. Toutefois, il ressortait des rapports reçus par le haut-commissariat que M. Aleaf avait admis lors d'une entrevue que, en fait, il avait vécu dans plusieurs camps de réfugiés au Pakistan entre 1996 et 1998, dont au moins l'un était administré par le Hizb-i-Islami Gulbuddin (HIG) comme refuge pour ses militants, ses partisans et leurs familles. Le HIG est un groupe très instable qui a participé à des attaques contre le gouvernement de l'Afghanistan.
[10]
M. Aleaf a modifié sa demande de résidence permanente après s'être marié. Il a de nouveau mis à jour ses formulaires d'immigration en 2012 de manière à inclure ses deux enfants: un fils et une fille. M. Aleaf a continué à affirmer dans ces formulaires mis à jour qu'il avait vécu à Kaboul entre 1995 et 1998.
[11]
Il n'est pas évident de savoir pourquoi le traitement de la demande de la famille Aleaf a pris autant de temps, mais nous savons que le haut-commissariat a décidé d'interviewer à nouveau M. Aleaf en 2013. Le haut-commissariat évaluait à nouveau son cas en raison du temps écoulé depuis la décision d'admissibilité de 2005, et parce que beaucoup d'Afghans qui résidaient au Pakistan rentraient maintenant chez eux.
[12]
Avant d'examiner le dossier de l'agente des visas concernant l'entrevue du 6 mai 2013 avec M. Aleaf, il importe de relever que M. Aleaf n'a pas déposé d'affidavit dans la présente instance. Par conséquent, la Cour ne dispose d'aucun élément de preuve qui remettrait en question l'exactitude du compte rendu de l'agente des visas quant à ce qui a été dit au cours de l'entrevue. M. Aleaf a produit une [traduction] « déclaration » non assermentée dans laquelle il critique l'interprétation que l'agente a faite des événements débattus pendant l'entrevue. Toutefois, il ne signale aucune imprécision dans les notes de l'agente.
II.
L'entrevue de 2013
[13]
M. Aleaf a dit à l'agente des visas qu'il avait un frère nommé Abdul Samay qui [traduction] « n'était pas une personne normale », en ce sens qu'il était paralysé, aveugle, sourd et [traduction] « simple d'esprit ». Ce frère se serait trouvé dans la maison familiale à Kaboul au moment de l'attaque à la roquette en 1995 et n'avait pas pu être retrouvé après l'attaque, qui avait complètement détruit la maison.
[14]
M. Aleaf affirme que sa famille et lui sont retournés dans leur village dans la province de Logar après l'attaque à la roquette, où ils ont vécu pendant l'année qui a suivi, une prétention qui ne concordait pas avec les coordonnées que M. Aleaf a communiquées dans ses formulaires d'immigration.
[15]
L'agente des visas a remis en question la décision de la famille de retourner dans son village, étant donné que c'était le lieu où se trouvaient les prétendus agents de persécution de la famille. L'agente a également soumis à M. Aleaf l'hypothèse que, si ses cousins avaient voulu s'en prendre à la famille, ils l'auraient fait au cours de l'année que la famille a passée dans la province de Logar. M. Aleaf n'a pas fourni d'explication cohérente à cette préoccupation, ce qui a amené l'agente à mettre en doute le récit portant sur le différend foncier.
[16]
M. Aleaf a dit à l'agente des visas qu'après avoir passé un an au village, il a passé les deux années suivantes à chercher son frère disparu dans différents endroits partout en Afghanistan. L'agente a eu du mal à croire cette allégation, étant donné que la famille n'était pas retournée à Kaboul à la recherche du corps d'Abdul Samay dans les décombres de leur maison, l'endroit où il aurait été le plus vraisemblablement été trouvé. L'agente ne comprenait pas pourquoi M. Aleaf pensait qu'un individu gravement handicapé aurait été en mesure de survivre à une attaque à la roquette, et ensuite de déménager dans une autre région de l'Afghanistan.
[17]
M. Aleaf déclare qu'il n'a pas accompagné sa famille lorsque celle-ci a déménagé au Pakistan en 1997, car il devait rester en Afghanistan pour continuer à chercher Abdul Samay. Étant donné les indices selon lesquels Abdul Samay était décédé lors de l'attaque à la roquette en 1995, l'agente a estimé que la prétention de M. Aleaf selon laquelle il aurait passé des années à chercher son frère en Afghanistan n'était pas vraisemblable.
[18]
Après avoir déménagé au Pakistan en 1998, M. Aleaf dit qu'il a obtenu un emploi dans un atelier de plomberie à Peshawar, où il a travaillé pendant les 12 années suivantes. Toutefois, M. Aleaf était incapable de se souvenir du nom de l'atelier, et il n'avait aucun document à l'appui de sa prétention d'emploi à long terme. M. Aleaf a aussi déclaré qu'il a perdu son emploi en 2012 parce que le propriétaire [traduction] « n'était pas bon avec les Afghans ». Comme l'agente des visas l'a relevé, il n'était pas logique que le propriétaire congédie soudainement M. Aleaf après 12 années d'emploi parce qu'il [traduction] « n'était pas bon avec les Afghans ».
[19]
Ces préoccupations ont amené l'agente des visas à tirer une conclusion générale selon laquelle M. Aleaf n'était tout simplement pas crédible. L'agente n'était pas convaincue que M. Aleaf serait exposé au risque en Afghanistan, et elle a conclu qu'il pourrait vivre en sécurité à Kaboul.
III.
M. Aleaf a-t-il été traité de manière inéquitable dans le processus de demande de visa?
[20]
M. Aleaf soutient tout d'abord qu'il a été traité de manière inéquitable dans le processus de demande de visa parce qu'il n'a pas reçu de copies des notes de service de 2006 de l'ASFC et du SCRS, ni de la lettre de dénonciation obtenue par le haut-commissariat du Canada à Islamabad en 2005.
[21]
Lorsqu'une question d'équité procédurale se pose, le rôle de la Cour consiste à déterminer si le processus suivi par le décideur présente le degré d'équité requis compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 43.
[22]
Comme je l'ai fait remarquer dans la décision aux termes de laquelle j'ai refusé de nommer un avocat spécial pour représenter les intérêts de M. Aleaf, dans une instance introduite sur le fondement de l'article 87 dans la présente affaire, j'admets que la présente affaire revêt indubitablement une grande importance pour M. Aleaf et sa famille, étant donné qu'ils sollicitaient l'entrée au Canada à titre de réfugiés. Toutefois, je n'ai pas été convaincue que la famille avait été traitée de manière inéquitable, compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances.
[23]
En ce qui concerne les deux notes de service du gouvernement, M. Aleaf soutient que le Dossier certifié du tribunal ne contient aucune trace d'une entrevue au cours de laquelle il a admis avoir fait une fausse déclaration quant à savoir où il se trouvait dans sa demande de résidence permanente. Cette prétention est problématique parce que M. Aleaf n'a pas nié avoir fait la déclaration qui lui est attribuée.
[24]
Tel qu'il a été indiqué précédemment, M. Aleaf n'a pas déposé d'affidavit à l'appui de sa demande de contrôle judiciaire, et sa déclaration non assermentée ne traite pas de cette question. Par conséquent, la Cour ne dispose d'aucun élément de preuve indiquant que M. Aleaf n'était pas au courant du contenu des notes de service, ou que leur défaut de divulgation lui a causé quelque préjudice que ce soit. En outre, il n'a signalé aucun élément de preuve qu'il aurait pu présenter pour réfuter les renseignements contenus dans les rapports s'il avait été au courant de leur existence.
[25]
De plus, les motifs de l'agente des visas ne comportent aucune indication selon laquelle un poids quelconque a été attribué aux renseignements contenus dans les notes de service. La décision de l'agente était fondée sur l'invraisemblance inhérente du récit de M. Aleaf selon lequel il avait passé plusieurs années à la recherche de son frère disparu dans différentes régions de l'Afghanistan pendant une période où il avait prétendu avoir vécu à Kaboul.
[26]
En ce qui concerne la lettre de dénonciation, selon la jurisprudence de la Cour, ces lettres sont intrinsèquement peu fiables:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 315, au paragraphe 15. Toutefois, la décision de l'agente des visas ne révèle nullement que l'agente était au courant du contenu de la lettre de 2005, ou qu'elle en aurait tenu compte d'une manière ou d'une autre. En fait, les notes de l'agente indiquent précisément que les [traduction] « renseignements défavorables » qui avaient été reçus en 2005 concernant M. Aleaf [traduction] « n'étaient pas au dossier, ni décrits dans le STIDI [Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration] ». La décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 61, invoquée par les demandeurs, est donc distincte: voir les paragraphes 30 et 32.
[27]
Les notes de l'agent des visas relatives à l'entrevue de 2013 confirment que celui-ci a expressément dit à M. Aleaf que l'agent était préoccupé quant à savoir où M. Aleaf était entre 1995 et 1998, et l'agent a amplement donné la possibilité à M. Aleaf de répondre à ces préoccupations. Aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale n'a donc été établi en l'espèce.
IV.
Le caractère raisonnable des conclusions de l'agente concernant la crédibilité
[28]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que les conclusions de l'agente portant sur la crédibilité étaient déraisonnables, parce que l'agente a omis de tenir compte du fait que M. Aleaf avait
deux
frères handicapés, Abdul Samay et Tawab. Selon la déclaration non assermentée de M. Aleaf et l'affidavit de son père, Tawab a été tué lors de l'attaque à la roquette en 1995, mais Abdul Samay a survécu à l'attaque et a disparu.
[29]
Cet argument est problématique parce que la Cour ne dispose d'aucun élément de preuve selon lequel l'agente a été mise au courant de cette allégation. Le père de M. Aleaf n'a pas assisté à l'entrevue avec l'agente des visas, et il n'est donc pas en mesure d'émettre des commentaires sur ce qui s'est dit lors de cette entrevue. Bien que M. Aleaf affirme dans sa déclaration que l'agente ne semblait pas comprendre qu'il avait deux frères handicapés, il n'indique nulle part dans sa déclaration qu'il a informé l'agente de ce fait.
[30]
Le récit fait par M. Aleaf à l'agente des visas quant à savoir où il était pendant les années entre 1995 et 1998 prêtait à confusion, était alambiqué et improbable. La conclusion de l'agente selon laquelle M. Aleaf n'était pas crédible est amplement étayée par le dossier, et aucun motif justifiant l'intervention de la Cour n'a été établi.
V.
Le fondement de la demande
[31]
Les demandeurs affirment aussi que l'agente des visas a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a omis d'accorder suffisamment de poids au fait que les autorités canadiennes de l'immigration avaient accepté les parents et les frères et sœurs de M. Aleaf comme réfugiés en 2000 et que M. Aleaf lui-même avait fait l'objet d'une décision favorable de sélection en 2005.
[32]
Toutefois, il ressort à l'évidence des motifs de l'agente des visas que celle-ci était bien au courant des antécédents de demandes d'asile de la famille, notamment du fait que les autorités canadiennes de l'immigration avaient accepté le récit du différend foncier en 2000. Toutefois, il doit être statué sur chaque demande d'asile en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres.
[33]
Nous ne savons pas de quels éléments de preuve disposait l'agent des visas qui a statué sur la demande d'asile de la famille en 2000, et nous ne savons pas non plus en quoi les éléments de preuve produits à l'appui des demandes d'asile des demandeurs différaient de ceux qui avaient été présentés à l'appui de la demande d'asile des parents et des frères et sœurs de M. Aleaf. Nous savons que l'agente des visas en l'espèce a conclu que la décision de la famille Aleaf de retourner dans son village en 1995 après la destruction de leur maison à Kaboul était incohérente avec leur crainte avec raison d'être persécutés par leurs parents dans la province de Logar. Il s'agissait d'une conclusion qu'il était raisonnablement loisible à l'agente de tirer compte tenu du dossier dont elle disposait.
[34]
En outre, les demandes d'asile des demandeurs ont été évaluées en 2013, lorsque les conditions en Afghanistan étaient assez différentes de celles qui existaient en 2000.
[35]
Contrairement à la situation que la Cour a eue à trancher dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] ACF no 1556, l'agente des visas a clairement expliqué pourquoi elle n'a pas accepté l'allégation de M. Aleaf selon laquelle il serait exposé au risque en Afghanistan. M. Aleaf n'a donc établi aucun fondement à l'intervention de la Cour sur ce motif.
VI.
Le défaut d'examiner une demande fondée sur le sexe
[36]
Le dernier argument des demandeurs est que l'agente des visas a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle n'a pas examiné la persécution fondée sur le sexe à laquelle l'épouse et la fille de M. Aleaf seraient exposées en Afghanistan. Cet argument est problématique, car la famille n'a formulé aucune allégation de cette nature dans sa demande de résidence permanente. Les demandes d'asile de l'épouse et des enfants de M. Aleaf dépendaient entièrement de la demande de celui-ci, laquelle était fondée sur le prétendu différend foncier.
[37]
Il est vrai qu'aux pages 745 et 746 de l'arrêt
Canada (Procureur général) c Ward
, [1993] ACS no 74, la Cour suprême a confirmé que la Commission doit examiner tous
les motifs
de la demande d'asile, même si les motifs n'ont pas été soulevés par le demandeur pendant l'audience, et que le demandeur n'a pas l'obligation de préciser les motifs pour lesquels il serait persécuté: voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Cette évaluation doit toutefois être faite en fonction des faits allégués par les demandeurs.
[38]
Dans l'arrêt
Ward
, le demandeur a affirmé avoir une crainte avec raison d'être persécuté en Irlande à la suite de plusieurs faits. Bien que la demande d'asile fût fondée à l'origine sur l'appartenance du demandeur à un groupe social, la Cour suprême a conclu que les faits en cause donnaient en fait lieu à une demande fondée sur des opinions politiques, et que la demande devrait être examinée sur ce fondement.
[39]
En l'espèce, les seuls faits dont il est dit qu'ils ont donné naissance à une crainte subjective de persécution en Afghanistan de la part des demandeurs, notamment l'épouse et la fille de M. Aleaf, étaient les faits liés au différend foncier. Personne n'a donné à penser que ce différend était relié de quelque façon que ce soit au sexe de l'épouse et de la fille de M. Aleaf, et l'agente n'a donc pas commis d'erreur en omettant d'examiner une demande fondée sur le sexe:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 986, au paragraphe 25;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 847, au paragraphe 11.
[40]
Le fait que les renseignements sur la situation dans le pays révèlent que la violence contre les femmes est un grave fléau en Afghanistan ne constitue pas un motif suffisant pour trancher de manière favorable une demande d'asile:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 122, au paragraphe 17.
[41]
Les demandeurs citent trois autres décisions à l'appui de leur allégation selon laquelle l'agente des visas avait l'obligation d'examiner une demande fondée sur le sexe, même si les demandeurs n'avaient formulé aucune demande en ce sens. Toutefois, ces décisions n'étayent pas la position des demandeurs. Dans les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] ACF no 320 et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2014] ACF no 736, aux paragraphes 4 et 34, des décisions statuant sur des demandes d'asile furent annulées en raison du défaut d'examiner un motif qui avait été
expressément allégué
par l'épouse du demandeur principal.
[42]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 271, la Cour a souligné que les demandeurs d'asile à l'étranger n'ont aucun droit à une entrevue, mais qu'il peut y avoir des cas où il est nécessaire d'interviewer un codemandeur, lorsque, par exemple, la crédibilité du demandeur principal est en cause. Toutefois, rien ne donne à penser que l'épouse de M. Aleaf avait une connaissance directe du prétendu différend foncier. Rien non plus ne donne à entendre qu'elle avait une connaissance directe des endroits où M. Aleaf était entre 1995 et 1998, une période antérieure de plusieurs années à leur mariage. Elle n'a pas déposé d'affidavit dans la présente affaire, et la Cour ne dispose d'aucun élément de preuve qui indique qu'elle aurait pu apporter des éclaircissements sur la situation.
VII.
Les dépens
[43]
Les demandeurs soutiennent aussi qu'il existe des « circonstances spéciales » en l'espèce (notamment le délai anormalement long de traitement de leur demande de visa) qui justifieraient qu'une ordonnance leur adjugeant les dépens soit rendue.
[44]
Les dépens ne sont généralement pas adjugés dans les procédures en matière d'immigration à la Cour. L'article 22 des
Règles des cours fédérales en matière de citoyenneté, d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés
, DORS/93-22 dispose que: « Sauf ordonnance contraire rendue par un juge pour des raisons spéciales, la demande d'autorisation, la demande de contrôle judiciaire ou l'appel introduit en application des présentes règles ne donnent pas lieu à des dépens. »
[45]
Le critère des « raisons spéciales » est rigoureux, et chaque décision devait reposer sur les faits dont est saisie la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 43, au paragraphe 8. Les demandeurs ne m'ont pas convaincue qu'il existe des « raisons spéciales » en l'espèce qui justifieraient qu'une ordonnance leur adjugeant les dépens soit rendue, et je refuse de rendre une telle ordonnance.
VIII.
Dispositif
[46]
Pour les motifs susmentionnés, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Je conviens avec les parties que la présente affaire ne soulève pas de question à certifier.
JUGEMENT
[47]
LA COUR STATUE que
:
1. La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
