Introduction and facts
[1]
Lemieux, J.
[Translation]: In Montréal, on
October 26, 2009
, after having heard the parties, I dismissed Mr. Azouz's appeal, filed under section 30 of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, 2000, c. 17 (the Act). The following reasons are in support of my decision. The only issue before the Court was whether Mr. Azouz had contravened subsection 12(1) of the Act.
[2]
I set out in the annex to these reasons the relevant provisions of the Act and of the associated Regulations-the
Cross-border Currency and Monetary Instruments Reporting Regulations
, SOR/2002-412 (the Regulations).
[3]
Mr. Azouz's appeal, by way of an action, concerned the decision of the Minister's delegate, rendered under section 27 of the Act on
November 14, 2007
, in which she found that the plaintiff had contravened subsection 12(1) of the Act with respect to the currency in his possession seized on
June 6, 2007,
at the Trudeau International Airport.
[4]
The circumstances surrounding this seizure of the currency and its return were established in a statement of agreed facts and admissions filed further to Prothonotary Morneau's order of April 1, 2009. This statement read as follows:
[TRANSLATION]
1. On June 6, 2007, the plaintiff and his spouse were about to leave the country and go to Paris from the Montréal-Trudeau International Airport.
2. Once the plaintiff and his spouse had passed the pre-boarding checkpoint, they were approached by a senior customs officer.
3. The senior customs officer first asked the plaintiff and his spouse the following question:
Do you have any currency or monetary instruments in your possession with a value equal to or greater than 10,000.00 Canadian dollars?
4. The plaintiff and his spouse replied NO.
5. The senior customs officer asked them how much currency or monetary instruments they had in their possession.
6. The plaintiff's spouse told the officer that she had nothing in her possession.
7. The plaintiff answered that he had only a few thousand.
8. At the request of the senior customs officer, the plaintiff specified that he had 7,000 (seven thousand), then specified that he had in his possession 4,000 euros and 2,000 Canadian dollars.
9. The senior customs officer asked the plaintiff and his spouse to follow him so that he could verify their statements, and he led them towards an interview room. Another customs officer who was assisting him followed them at a distance of about 8 feet.
10. During the walk between the pre-boarding checkpoint and the interview room, the plaintiff gave his spouse 700 euros.
11. The senior customs officer asked the plaintiff's spouse to give him the amount her spouse had just given her, which she did.
12. The plaintiff and his spouse then entered the interview room.
13. An examination of the plaintiff's monetary instruments revealed that the plaintiff had in his possession various currencies with a value of
$11,097.78
Canadian distributed as follows:
• 5,000 euros;
• 3,041 US dollars; and
• 700 Canadian dollars.
14. No money was found in the possession of the plaintiff's spouse, Peggy Azouz.
15. The senior customs officer then seized as forfeit this sum of $11,097.78 under subsection 18(1) of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17 (hereafter the Act).
16. The customs officer returned the seized currency to the plaintiff ($11,097.78) upon payment by the plaintiff
of a penalty of $2,500
set out in paragraph 18(
b
) of the
Cross-border Currency and Monetary Instruments Reporting Regulations
, SOR/2002-412.
17. In this regard, the customs officer issued a written notice of the seizure in the name of the plaintiff and his spouse, Peggy Azouz. This notice indicated, in particular, the amount of currency seized, the amount of the imposed penalty as well as the plaintiff's right to appeal.
18.
On June 6, 2007
, the senior customs officer wrote the narrative report set out in section 20 of the Act. The assisting customs officer also wrote a narrative report on this date. These narrative reports were first disclosed to the plaintiff's counsel, Sami Iskandar, on or before
July 3, 2007
.
[5]
Following these events, in accordance with sections 25 and 27 of the Act, Mr. Azouz requested a decision of the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) of the Act had been contravened. The plaintiff's counsel presented his evidence against the seizure. A report written by an officer with the Canada Border Services Agency (the Agency) described the facts and circumstances of the seizure based on the two narrative statements of the senior customs officer and his assistant. The Minister's delegate rendered her decision,
according to section 27 of the Act, on November 14, 2007
.
[6]
The Minister's delegate found the following:
1. There was a contravention of subsection 12(1) of the Act: "as the currency in your possession was of a value greater than $10 000.00 CAD and you failed to declare it to Canada Border Services Agency, a contravention of subsection 12(1) of the Act did occur. The currency was lawfully subject to seizure under subsection 18(1) of this Act."
2. The plaintiff's spouse, Peggy Azouz, did not contravene subsection 12(1) of the Act and her name was withdrawn from the Canada Border Services Agency records.
3. The penalty upon the return of the seized currencies
should have been $250 rather than $2,500
: "because, although the currency was not reported, it was not concealed, a full disclosure of the facts was made upon discovery and you were not subject to a previous seizure under this Act. The prescribed penalty for a Level 1 infraction is $250."
[7]
By means of a letter dated November 28, 2007, Mr. Azouz asked the Minister's delegate if it was possible to withdraw his name from the customs databank so that he would not experience any inconvenience going through customs as a result of the seizure of June 6, 2007.
[8]
On December 24, 2007
, an Agency adjudicator replied to the plaintiff's counsel that the plaintiff's name would stay in the Agency's system for a period of 6 years from the time of the contravention, and that consequently the plaintiff could be the subject of enhanced checks when going through customs in the future.
[9]
In the meantime, on or around November 28, 2007, the plaintiff received a letter from the Agency telling him that his request to participate in the NEXUS system had been refused because of a previous contravention of the customs legislation. This NEXUS program is for Canadian and American business people who travel frequently and aims to facilitate customs procedures during departures and arrivals at the common borders of the two (2) countries.
[10]
On February 12, 2008, the plaintiff filed an action in this case under section 30 of the Act.
Preliminary comments
[11]
As mentioned in his order dated April 1, 2009, regarding the pre-trial conference and the conduct of the action, Prothonotary Morneau ordered that the only issue for determination was whether the plaintiff had contravened subsection 12(1) of the Act. He also ordered that there would be no
expert
witness produced by the parties at trial and, as mentioned, ordered the filing of a statement of agreed facts and admissions, which was to be
as complete as possible
.
[12]
At the beginning of the hearing on October 26, 2009, Mr. Azouz's counsel informed the Court that Mr. and Mrs. Azouz wanted to testify, which took the Court a bit by surprise considering the extent of the facts and admissions in the statement as well as the acknowledged principle that their testimony could not contradict what had been admitted in the statement or argued in the report sought before the Court under section 30 of the Act.
[13]
The Court asked that this situation be clarified and after obtaining two admissions from the Minister, Mr. Azouz's counsel acknowledged that there was no point, and the Court found that it was irrelevant to make his clients testify. The admissions were the following:
1. The Minister admitted for the purposes of this case that 700 of the 5,000 euros Mr. Azouz had in his possession at the time of the seizure was the property of Mrs. Azouz, but it was not admitted that the 700 Canadian dollars in Mr. Azouz's possession was his spouse's property.
2. The Minister also admitted that Mr. Azouz subjectively did not believe that he was in possession of more than 10,000 Canadian dollars in euros, American dollars and Canadian dollars.
[14]
I did not allow Mrs. Azouz to testify that the 700 Canadian dollars was her property. I was of the opinion that testimony in this regard would contradict either the statement or the report filed before this Court when there was never a question that the Canadian dollars belonged to her. In fact, one of the paragraphs of the report sought by Mr. Azouz indicated that the seven hundred Canadian dollars was his property.
[15]
Finally, at the end of the argument, Mr. Azouz asked me if he could address the Court. I upheld the Minister's objection on this point on the ground that counsel representing him was in reply.
[16]
The parties recognized that the appeal procedure before me was not a judicial review but rather a trial
de novo
in which the parties could testify and plead facts not before the Minister.
Analysis
(1)
The Act and the associated Regulations
[17]
Everything concerning the duty to report the importation or exportation of currency is clear and unambiguous in the Act and the Regulations. They state to whom, by whom, when, how, why and in what circumstances a report must be made and the consequences of a contravention. These elements are set out in sections 12 and 18 of the Act and in sections 2, 3 and 11 of the Regulations.
[18]
A person who leaves the country with, in his or her
actual possession
or as part of his or her baggage, currency with a value equal to or greater than $10,000 has a duty to disclose this amount by means of a written report submitted, without delay, to an officer at the customs office located at the place of exportation or, if the office is closed, at the time of exportation, at the nearest customs office that is open.
[19]
Enforcement of the Act is set out in section 18, which provides that if the officer believes on reasonable grounds that subsection 12(1) has been contravened, "the officer
may
seize as forfeit the currency"
but must return the seized currency on payment of a penalty in the prescribed amount to the individual from whom it was seized or to the lawful owner unless
the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the money is proceeds of crime within the meaning of subsection 462.3(1) of the
Criminal
Code
or funds for use in the financing of terrorist activities. The penalties are set out in section 18 of the Regulations. The amount: (1) of $250 is prescribed for a person who has not concealed the currency; (2) of $2,500 is prescribed for a person who has concealed the currency; and (3) of $5,000 is the maximum amount for a person who has concealed the currency by using a false compartment. I note, once again, that the minimum penalty was imposed on the plaintiff following his appeal to the Minister under section 27 of the Act.
[20]
One of the purposes of the Act stated at subparagraph 3(
a
)(ii) is "requiring the reporting of suspicious financial transactions
and
of cross-border movements of currency and monetary instruments".
(2)
Mr. Azouz's argument
[21]
During his argument, Mr. Azouz's counsel admitted that before taking his flight to Paris the evening of June 6, 2007, he (1) had in his possession the equivalent of more than 10,000 Canadian dollars (transcript, page 55), and (2) had not submitted the required written report (transcript, page 148, line 22). He reported it verbally only after going through security and when confronted by an officer.
[22]
In his defence, he argued the following:
(1) Under the circumstances, Mr. Azouz was not required to submit a report to the customs office in accordance with section 11 of the Regulations because he did not believe that he had more than $10,000 on him because a large amount belonged to his spouse; he was convinced that he would have had less than $10,000 in his pockets before boarding the plane as he intended to buy duty-free presents and have a meal in the airport with Mrs. Azouz.
(2) The seizure under section 18 was illegal because, on the one hand, the officer did not believe on reasonable grounds that section 12 of the Act had been contravened and, on the other hand, the officer improperly exercised his discretion under the circumstances given that the purpose of the Act is to target money laundering or the financing of terrorist activities but not [translation] "to nail someone with a few extra dollars" (transcript, page 60, line 14). According to counsel, the officer, by making the seizure, did not recognize that his discretion was to promote these purposes of the Act.
(3) The Minister had to demonstrate that he had in his possession more than $20,000 because his spouse was involved in the proceedings as a "co-offender"; she was included in the seizure.
(4) The officer was verbally violent toward Mr. and Mrs. Azouz, which resulted in the charge against Mr. and Mrs. Azouz and then the seizure. He claimed that the Act is penal legislation and that the officer acted in bad faith.
Conclusions
[23]
I am unable to agree with any of the submissions of Mr. Azouz's counsel. These submissions, on the one hand, go against the scheme of the Act, the case law that has interpreted it and Parliament's related statutes and, on the other hand, are elements cited for the first time in an appeal before this Court. The following judgments are relevant to the interpretation of the Act and associated  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.), upheld in appeal 2007 FCA 186 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
(2)
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ); and
(3)
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
I also cite the Supreme Court of Canada's judgment in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and the decision by this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  rendered under the
Customs Act
.
[25]
The following principles emerge from this case law:
(1) The seizure and forfeiture process in the Act is a
civil
collection mechanism that is not intended to punish the individual; the individual is not an accused; the person is not charged with any criminal, quasi-criminal or regulatory offence (see: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 2007 FCA 186, at paragraphs 42 to 46). I add that section 73.11 of the Act requires, under the conditions applicable to the case, that the amount of the required penalties takes into account that the purpose of the penalties is not to punish but to encourage compliance with this Act and the associated Regulations.
(2) "If you do not declare, the Customs officer is entitled to forfeit that which should have been declared. It is as simple as that." (See the decision by my colleague, Justice Harrington, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 2006 FC 50, at paragraph 56.)
(3) The objectives of the
Customs Act
(CA) are to regulate, oversee and control cross-border movements of people and goods. The attainment of these objectives depends on the effectiveness of the voluntary or self-reporting system. To enforce the CA, Parliament has implemented civil and penal mechanisms (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 26, 27 and 28 and see also <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , decision rendered by Justice Harrington, 2006 FC 50, at paragraph 54).
(4) The purpose of the Act is more than combatting international money laundering. The Act requires the reporting of the importation of currency and monetary instruments. To achieve this purpose, a tracking system is obligatory (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 29).
(5) A traveller's subjective intention when failing to report is irrelevant; strict liability attaches to those who fail to report (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 53).
[26]
Furthermore, in my opinion, for the following reasons there is no merit to the argument raised by the defendant's counsel on the legality of the seizure on the ground that it was a search or a seizure without reasonable grounds or, in any event, that the officer improperly exercised his discretion.
[27]
This issue was not relevant in the context of an appeal under section 30 of the Act of the decision of the Minister's delegate under section 27 of the Act. It was not raised as an issue before Prothonotary Morneau and, on the merits, the officer had reasonable grounds to seize given the responses given by the plaintiff and his spouse. In my opinion, his discretion to seize was completely consistent with the purposes of the Act and was exercised in accordance with the Act and the associated Regulations.
[28]
According to the evidence, it is obvious that one of the principal reasons stated by Mr. Azouz for appealing to this Court was not that a $250 penalty was imposed on him, but that his name was kept on a verification list for the future and because, subjectively, he did not think that he had contravened the Act. With respect to the first reason, it is not relevant in an appeal under section 30 of the Act; if he felt aggrieved on this point, other remedies were available to him; on the second point, his subjective belief, which was not called into question, has no relevance under the Act and the Regulations.
[29]
At the end of the argument, the Minister's counsel informed me that the Minister had made the plaintiff an offer to settle-his abandonment without costs. If the Minister had had the provisions of sections 420 and 421 of the
Federal Court Rules
in mind, I do not believe that the requirement for a compromise in the Minister's offer would have been met (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). I therefore think that the Minister is not entitled to double costs, but being the successful party, is entitled to ordinary costs. I therefore order that Mr. Azouz pay the Minister's costs according to the scale of costs in the tariff of the rules, that is, at level 3.

d) être signée et datée par la personne ou l'entité visée aux alinéas 12(3)a), b), c), d) ou e) de la Loi, selon le case (Je souligne.)
Section 11 of the Regulations prescribes where a report with respect to currency must be submitted and by whom. Section 15 establishes one exception for exported or imported currency:
11.
A report with respect to currency or monetary instruments transported by a person departing from Canada shall be submitted without delay by the person at the customs office located at the place of exportation or, if it is not open for business at the time of exportation, at the nearest customs office that is open for business at that time.
. . .
EXCEPTION APPLICABLE TO THE BANK OF CANADA
15. A person or entity is not required to make a report under subsection 12(1) of the Act with respect to stocks, bonds and debentures imported into Canada by courier or as mail if the importer is a financial entity or a securities dealer as defined in subsection 1(2) of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations or a transfer agent. (emphasis mine.)
11.
La déclaration relative à des espèces ou effets transportés par une personne quittant le Canada doit être présentée sans délai par cette personne au bureau de douane situé au lieu de l'exportation ou, si ce bureau est fermé au moment de l'exportation, au bureau de douane le plus proche qui est ouvert.
...
EXCEPTION RELATIVE À LA BANQUE DU CANADA
15. Les espèces qui sont importées ou exportées par la Banque du Canada ou en son nom en vue de la distribution, du traitement ou de la mise à l'essai de billets de banque destinés à circuler au Canada n'ont pas à être déclarées en application du paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi. (Je souligne.)

Le juge Lemieux
: À Montréal,
le 26 octobre 2009
, après avoir entendu les parties, j'ai rejeté l'appel de Monsieur Azouz, déposé en vertu de l'article 30 de la
Loi sur le recyclage des produits de la criminalité et le financement des activités terroristes
, 2000, ch. 17 (la Loi). Les motifs qui suivent sont à l'appui de ma décision. La seule question devant la Cour était de savoir si Monsieur Azouz a contrevenu au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi.
[2]
Je reproduis en annexe à ces motifs les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi et son Règlement d'application - Le
Règlement sur la déclaration des mouvements transfrontaliers d'espèces et d'effets
, DORS/2002-412 (le Règlement).
[3]
L'appel de Monsieur Azouz, par voie d'action, vise la décision de la déléguée du Ministre rendue, selon l'article 27 de la Loi,
le 14 novembre 2007
, dans laquelle elle a conclu que le demandeur avait contrevenu le paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi à l'égard des devises en sa possession saisies
le 6 juin 2007
à l'Aéroport international Trudeau.
[4]
Les circonstances entourant cette saisie des devises et la remise de celles-ci ont été établies dans un exposé conjoint des faits et des admissions déposé, suite à l'ordonnance du Protonotaire Morneau du 1er avril 2009. Cet exposé se lit:
1. Le 6 juin 2007, le demandeur et son épouse s'apprêtaient à quitter le pays à destination de Paris à l'Aéroport international de Montréal-Trudeau.
2. Dès après que le demandeur et son épouse eurent passé le point de contrôle pré-embarquement, ils ont été approchés par un agent des douanes principal.
3. L'agent des douanes principal a posé au demandeur et à son épouse la première question suivante:
Avez-vous en votre possession des devises ou instruments monétaires d'une valeur égale ou supérieure à 10 000.00 dollars canadiens?
4. Le demandeur et son épouse ont répondu NON.
5. L'agent des douanes principal leur a demandé combien de devises ou instruments monétaires ils avaient en leur possession.
6. L'épouse du demandeur a répondu notamment à l'agent qu'elle n'avait rien en sa possession.
7. Le demandeur a de son côté répondu qu'il avait seulement quelques milliers (
only a few thousands
).
8. À la demande de l'agent des douanes principal, le demandeur a précisé qu'il avait 7 000 (
seven thousands
), puis a précisé qu'il avait en sa possession 4 000 euros et 2 000 dollars canadiens.
9. L'agent des douanes principal a demandé au demandeur et à son épouse de la suivre afin qu'elle puisse vérifier leurs affirmations, et les a précédés en direction d'une salle d'entrevue. Néanmoins, un autre agent des douanes assistant, les suivait à une distance d'environ 8 pieds.
10. Durant la marche entre le point de contrôle pré-embarquement et la salle d'entrevue, le demandeur a remis à son épouse une somme de 700 euros.
11. L'agent des douanes principal a demandé à l'épouse du demandeur de lui remettre la somme que son mari venait tout juste de lui donner, ce qui fut fait.
12. Le demandeur et son épouse sont alors entrés dans la salle d'entrevue.
13. L'examen des effets du demandeur a révélé que le demandeur était en possession de diverses espèces d'une valeur de
11 097.78$
canadiens réparties comme suit:
• 5 000 euros;
• 3 041 dollars US; et,
• 700 dollars canadiens.
14. Aucune somme d'argent ne fut trouvée en possession de l'épouse du demandeur, Madame Peggy Azouz.
15. L'agent des douanes principal a alors saisi à titre de confiscation cette somme de 11 097.78$ en application du paragraphe 18(1) de la
Loi sur le recyclage des produits de
de la criminalité et le financement des activités terroristes
, L.C. 2000, ch. 17, (ci-après « la Loi »).
16. L'agent des douanes a restitué au demandeur les devises saisies (11 097.78$) sur paiement par le demandeur
d'une pénalité de 2 500$
prévue à l'alinéa 18b) du
Règlement sur la déclaration des mouvements transfrontaliers d'espèces ou d'effets
, DORS/2002-412.
17. L'agent des douanes a émis à cet effet un avis écrit de la saisie au nom du demandeur et de son épouse, Madame Peggy Azouz. Cet avis indique notamment le montant des espèces saisies, le montant de la pénalité imposée, ainsi que le droit d'appel du demandeur.
18.
Le 6 juin 2007
, l'agent des douanes principal a rédigé le rapport narratif prévu à l'article 20 de la Loi. L'agent des douanes assistant a également rédigé un rapport narratif à cette date. Ces rapports narratifs ont été communiqués une première fois au procureur du demandeur, Me Sami Iskandar, le ou avant
le 3 juillet 2007
.
[5]
Suite à ces événements, conformément aux articles 25 et 27 de la Loi, Monsieur Azouz a demandé au Ministre de décider s'il y a eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi. Le procureur du demandeur a fait valoir ses moyens de preuve à l'encontre de la saisie. Un rapport rédigé par un agent de l'Agence des Services frontaliers du Canada (l'Agence) décrit les faits et circonstances de la saisie basés sur les deux déclarations narratives de l'agent des douanes principal et son assistant. La déléguée du Ministre a rendu sa décision,
selon l'article 27 de la Loi, le 14 novembre 2007
.
[6]
La déléguée du Ministre conclut:
1. Qu'il y a eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi: "as the currency in your possession was of a value greater than $10 000.00 CAD and you failed to declare it to Canada Border Services Agency, a contravention of subsection 12(1) of the Act did occur. The currency was lawfully subject to seizure under subsection 18(1) of this Act."
2. L'épouse du demandeur, Peggy Azouz, n'a pas commis de contravention au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi et son nom a été retiré des registres de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada.
3. La pénalité pour la mainlevée de la saisie des devises
devait être de 250$ plutôt que 2 500$
: "because, although the currency was not reported, it was not concealed, a full disclosure of the facts was made upon discovery and you were not subject to a previous seizure under this Act. The prescribed penalty for a Level 1 infraction is $250."
[7]
Par lettre du 28 novembre 2007, Monsieur Azouz a demandé à la déléguée du Ministre s'il était possible de retirer le nom du demandeur de la banque de donnés des douanes et ce, afin que le demandeur puisse ne pas subir lors de passages aux douanes les inconvénients résultant de la saisie du 6 juin 2007.
[8]
Le 24 décembre 2007
, une arbitre de l'Agence a répondu au procureur du demandeur que le nom du demandeur demeurait dans le système de l'Agence pour une période de 6 ans à compter de la contravention, et qu'en conséquence le demandeur pourrait être sujet à de plus grandes vérifications lors de ses prochains passages aux douanes.
[9]
Dans l'intervalle, le ou vers le 28 novembre 2007, le demandeur avait reçu une lettre de l'Agence lui indiquant que sa demande de participation au régime NEXUS était refusée en raison d'une contravention antérieure à la législation douanière. Ce programme NEXUS est destiné aux gens d'affaires canadiens et américains qui voyagent fréquemment, et vise à faciliter les procédures douanières lors des départs et arrivées aux frontières communes des deux (2) pays.
[10]
Le 12 février 2008, le demandeur a déposé une action en l'instance en vertu de l'article 30 de la Loi.
Remarques préliminaires
[11]
Tel que mentionné dans son ordonnance du 1er avril 2009 relative à la conférence préparatoire et à la conduite de l'action, le protonotaire Morneau ordonnait que la seule question à trancher était de savoir si le demandeur a contrevenu au paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi. Il a aussi ordonné qu'il n'y aura aucun témoin
expert
produit par les parties à l'instruction et, tel que mentionné, a ordonné le dépôt d'un exposé conjoint de faits et d'admissions
le plus complet possible
.
[12]
Au début de l'audience du 26 octobre 2009, le procureur de Monsieur Azouz a avisé la Cour que Monsieur et Madame Azouz voulaient témoigner ce qui a pris celle-ci un peu par surprise considérant l'ampleur des faits et des admissions dans l'exposé ainsi que le principe reconnu que leurs témoignages ne pourraient contredire ce qui avait été admis dans l'exposé ou plaidé dans la déclaration recherchée devant la Cour sous l'article 30 de la Loi.
[13]
La Cour a demandé que cette situation soit clarifiée et après avoir obtenu deux admissions de la part du Ministre, le procureur de Monsieur Azouz a reconnu qu'il n'y avait aucune utilité et la Cour a conclu à aucune pertinence de faire témoigner ses clients. Les admissions étaient celles-ci:
1. Il est admis par le Ministre pour les fins du dossier que 700 sur les 5 000 euros que Monsieur Azouz possédait au moment de la saisie étaient la propriété de Madame Azouz mais il n'était pas admis que les 700 dollars canadiens en possession de Monsieur Azouz étaient la propriété de son épouse.
2. Il a été aussi admis par le Ministre que Monsieur Azouz subjectivement ne croyait pas qu'il était en possession de plus de 10 000 dollars canadiens en euros, dollars américains et dollars canadiens.
[14]
Je n'ai pas permis à Madame Azouz de témoigner que les 700 dollars canadiens étaient sa propriété. J'étais d'avis qu'un témoignage à cet effet allait contredire soit l'exposé ou soit la déclaration déposée devant cette Cour où il n'avait jamais été question que les dollars canadiens appartenaient à Madame. En effet la déclaration recherchée par Monsieur Azouz indiquait au paragraphe de celle-ci que les sept cents dollars canadiens étaient sa propriété.
[15]
Finalement, à la fin des plaidoiries, Monsieur Azouz m'a demandé s'il pouvait adresser la Cour. J'ai maintenu l'objection du Ministre sur ce point au motif que son procureur qui le représentait était en réplique.
[16]
Les parties ont reconnu que la procédure d'appel devant moi n'était pas un contrôle judiciaire mais un procès
de novo
dans lequel les parties pouvaient témoigner et plaider des faits qui n'étaient pas devant le Ministre.
Analyse
(1)
La Loi et son Règlement
[17]
Tout ce qui concerne l'obligation de déclarer l'importation ou l'exportation des espèces est clair et sans ambiguïté dans la Loi et le Règlement. Elles énoncent à qui, par qui, quand, comment, pourquoi, dans quelles circonstances une déclaration doit être présentée et les conséquences d'une contravention. Ces éléments sont prévus aux articles 12 et 18 de la Loi et aux articles 2, 3 et 11 du Règlement.
[18]
Une personne qui quitte le pays ayant en sa
possession effective
ou parmi ses bagages des espèces d'une valeur égale ou supérieure à 10 000$ est tenue de dévoiler cette somme par moyen d'une déclaration écrite présentée, sans délai, par cette personne à un agent au bureau de douane situé au lieu de l'exportation ou, si ce bureau est fermé, au moment de l'exportation, au bureau de douane le plus proche qui est ouvert.
[19]
L'application de la Loi est visée par l'article 18 qui prévoit que si l'agent a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'il y a eu contravention à l'article 12(1), « l'agent
peut
saisir à titre de confiscation des espèces »
mais doit restituer sur réception de la pénalité réglementaire au saisi ou au propriétaire légitime
les espèces saisies
sauf
s'il soupçonne pour des motifs raisonnables qu'il s'agit de produits de la criminalité au sens du paragraphe 462.3(1) du
Code criminel
ou de fonds destinés au financement des activités terroristes. Les pénalités règlementaires sont prescrites à l'article 18 du Règlement. Le montant: (1) de 250$ est prescrit pour une personne qui n'a pas dissimulé les espèces; (2) de 2 500$ pour celle qui a dissimulé les espèces; et, (3) un montant maximum de 5 000$ pour une personne qui a dissimulé les espèces en se servant de faux compartiments. Je note, encore une fois, que le demandeur a été frappé de la pénalité minimale suite à son appel au Ministre en vertu de l'article 27 de la Loi.
[20]
Un des objectifs de la Loi énoncé à l'article 3a)(ii) est « d'établir un régime de déclaration obligatoire des opérations financières douteuses
et
des mouvements transfrontaliers d'espèces et d'effets. »
(2)
La plaidoirie de Monsieur Azouz
[21]
Durant sa plaidoirie, le procureur de Monsieur Azouz a admis, qu'avant de prendre son envolée vers Paris le soir du 6 juin 2007: il (1) avait en sa possession plus de 10 000 dollars en équivalence canadienne (notes sténographiques, page 55); et, (2) n'avait pas présenté la déclaration écrite requise (notes sténographiques, page 148, ligne 22). Il l'avait déclaré oralement seulement après avoir passé la sécurité lorsque confronté par un agent.
[22]
En défense, il plaide:
(1) que dans les circonstances, Monsieur Azouz n'avait pas l'obligation de présenter une déclaration au bureau de douane en conformité avec l'article 11 du Règlement parce qu'il ne croyait pas qu'il avait plus que 10 000$ sur lui puisqu'une somme importante appartenait à son épouse; il était convaincu qu'il aurait moins de 10 000$ dans ses poches avant de prendre l'avion puisqu'il avait l'intention d'acheter des cadeaux hors taxes et de prendre avec Madame Azouz un repas à l'aéroport.
(2) La saisie sous l'article 18 était illégale, d'une part, parce que l'agent n'avait pas de motifs raisonnables qu'il y avait contravention à l'article 12 de la Loi et, d'autre part, l'agent a mal exercé sa discrétion dans les circonstances vu que l'objectif de la Loi est de viser le blanchissement de l'argent ou le financement du terrorisme mais pas « pour pincer quelqu'un avec quelques dollars de plus » (notes sténographiques, page 60, ligne 14). Selon le procureur, l'agent, en effectuant la saisie, n'a pas reconnu que sa discrétion était de promouvoir ces objectifs de la Loi.
(3) Le Ministre devait démontrer qu'il avait en sa possession plus que 20 000$ parce que son épouse était impliquée dans les procédures comme « co-offender »; on l'a inclus dans la saisie.
(4) Il y a eu violence verbale de la part de l'agent à l'encontre de Monsieur et Madame Azouz ce qui a donné lieu à l'accusation contre Monsieur et Madame Azouz et, comme suite, la saisie. Il prétend que la Loi est une loi à caractère pénal et que l'agent a agi de mauvaise foi.
Conclusions
[23]
Je ne peux souscrire à aucune des prétentions du procureur de Monsieur Azouz. Ses prétentions vont, d'une part, à l'encontre de l'économie de la Loi et la jurisprudence qui a interprété celle-ci et les lois connexes du Parlement et, d'autre part, sont des éléments évoqués pour la première fois en appel devant cette Cour. Les arrêts suivants sont pertinents sur l'interprétation de la Loi et de son règlement d'application:
(1) L'arrêt
Tourki c. le ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile
, 2006 CF 50 (C.F.), maintenu en appel 2007 CAF 186 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
(2) L'arrêt
Zeid c. le Ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile
, 2008 CF 539 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ); et,
(3) L'arrêt
Hoang c. le ministre du Revenu national et
al, 2006 CF 182 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
Je cite aussi le jugement de la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et une décision de cette Cour, dans:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  rendue sous la
Loi sur les douanes
.
[25]
Les principes suivants se dégagent de cette jurisprudence:
(1) Le processus relatif à la saisie et la confiscation dans la Loi est un mécanisme de recouvrement
civil
qui ne vise pas à punir l'individu; la personne visée n'est pas un inculpé; elle n'est accusée d'aucune infraction criminelle, quasi criminelle ou de nature réglementaire (voir: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 2007 CAF 186, aux paragraphes 42 à 46). J'ajoute que l'article 73.11 de la Loi exige, sous les conditions applicables en l'espèce, que le montant des pénalités exigées prennent en considération que leur but n'est pas de punir mais d'encourager le respect de la Loi et de son Règlement.
(2) « Si le voyageur ne fait pas de déclaration, l'agent des douanes peut confisquer ce qui aurait dû être déclaré. C'est aussi simple que cela. » (voir la décision de mon collègue le juge Harrington dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 2006 CF 50, au paragraphe 56.)
(3) La
Loi sur les douanes
(LD) a pour objectifs de régir, d'encadrer et de contrôler la circulation transfrontalière des personnes et des marchandises. La réalisation de ces objectifs dépend de l'efficacité du système d'auto-déclaration ou de déclaration volontaire. Pour assurer le respect de la LD, le législateur a mis en place des mécanismes civils et pénaux (voir: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 26, 27 et 28 et voir aussi: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , décision rendue par le juge Harrington, 2006 CF 50, au paragraphe 54).
(4) L'objet de la Loi vise plus qu'une lutte contre le recyclage de l'argent à l'échelle internationale. La Loi exige la déclaration des importations d'espèces et d'effets. Un système de dépistage est nécessaire à cette fin (voir: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 29).
(5) L'intention subjective du passager qui a omis de faire une déclaration n'est pas un facteur pertinent ..., ceux qui omettent de faire cette déclaration sont assujettis à une responsabilité absolue (voir: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 53).
[26]
Qui plus est, à mon avis, pour les raisons suivantes il n'y a aucun mérite à l'argument soulevé par le procureur du demandeur sur la légalité de la saisie au motif qu'il s'agissait d'une fouille ou une saisie sans motifs raisonnables ou, de toute façon que l'agent a mal exercé sa discrétion.
[27]
Cette question n'était pas pertinente dans le contexte d'un appel sous l'article 30 de la Loi qui est à l'encontre de la décision de la déléguée du Ministre rendue sous l'article 27 de la Loi. Elle n'a pas été soulevée comme question en litige devant le Protonotaire Morneau et, au mérite, l'agent avait des motifs raisonnables de saisir vu les réponses données par le demandeur et son épouse. À mon avis, sa discrétion de saisir était tout à fait conforme aux objectifs de la Loi et a été exercée en conformité avec la Loi et son Règlement.
[28]
Selon la preuve, il est évident qu'un des motifs principaux exprimés par Monsieur Azouz d'en avoir appelé à cette Cour n'était pas parce qu'il a été frappé d'une pénalité de 250$ mais que son nom a été maintenu sur une liste de vérification à l'avenir et au motif que subjectivement, il ne pensait pas d'avoir contrevenu à la loi. Quant au premier motif, il n'est pas pertinent dans un appel sous l'article 30 de la Loi; s'il se croit lésé sur ce point, d'autres moyens de recours sont à sa disposition; sur le second point, sa croyance subjective, qui n'est pas mise en doute, n'a aucune pertinence sous la Loi et le Règlement.
[29]
A la fin de la plaidoirie, le procureur du Ministre m'a informé que le Ministre avait offert au demandeur un règlement - son désistement sans frais. Si le Ministre avait en vue les dispositions des articles 420 et 421 des
Règles de la Cour fédérale
, je ne crois pas que l'exigence qu'il y ait un compromis dans l'offre du Ministre soit rencontrée (voir:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). J'estime donc que le Ministre n'a pas droit à double dépens mais étant de la partie gagnante, il a droit aux dépens ordinaires. J'ordonne donc que Monsieur Azouz paie les dépens du Ministre selon l'échelle des dépens prescrits au tarif des règles, c'est-à-dire au niveau 3.
