Strickland, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated February 15, 2013. The RPD determined that the Applicant is not a convention refugee and not a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97, respectively, of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA). This application is brought pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the IRPA.
Background
[2]
The Applicant is a citizen of Saint Lucia. He claims that in March 2009, he was approached by members of a drug gang and asked to sell drugs on their behalf. He refused. The following day his mother's home, where he resided, was broken into. He reported this to the police who came to the home to investigate.
[3]
In April 2009, he was again stopped by members of the gang who told him that he should start working with them to sell drugs. He again refused. The next day his mother's house was again broken into, and food and appliances were taken. He and his mother made a report at the police station and later followed up, but were advised that the police had nothing to report.
[4]
The Applicant was not approached again until a year later, in April 2010, when members of the same gang picked him up, drove him around in a vehicle and again asked him to sell drugs on their behalf. He refused and was released. He was again approached in September, October and December 2010. In April 2011, six gang members came to his home, tied him and his mother up and threatened their lives if he did not agree to sell drugs on their behalf.
[5]
Following this incident, his mother immediately moved to another town. The Applicant continued his employment but no longer slept at home, instead staying with different family members. The Applicant came to Canada on September 29, 2011 and claimed refugee protection on November 8, 2011.
[6]
By its decision dated February 15, 2013, the RPD found that the Applicant is not a convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1), respectively, of the IRPA (the Decision).
Decision Under Review
[7]
The RPD stated that the Applicant testified in a straightforward manner, and that there were some relevant inconsistencies in his testimony and contradictions between his testimony and other evidence which were not satisfactorily explained. With respect to the threats against him, the Applicant did not submit any affidavits, letters or other supporting documentary evidence other than a letter from his mother. He also failed to produce police reports to corroborate his reporting of the two break-ins, his testimony being that he had tried to obtain them but that they were not provided by the police. The RPD found that the Applicant had failed to provide "sufficient and credible trustworthy evidence" that he had been threatened by gang members.
[8]
The RPD found that the Applicant's fear in this case was not linked to race, religion or nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. He was a victim of crime which did not serve to establish a nexus between his fear of persecution and one of the convention grounds. Accordingly, his section 96 claim failed.
[9]
The RPD next considered whether the harm feared by the Applicant was such that it posed a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment thereby qualifying him as a person in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. The RPD found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Applicant was a victim of unknown gang members and was being threatened with physical harm and perhaps even death but that this is one of the many crimes which occur in Saint Lucia and was not specific to the Applicant.
[10]
The RPD found that the fact that the first time the Applicant was approached by the gang members they called him by his nickname, "Jay", did not make the risk personalized, particularly as the Applicant had testified that he was well-known in the area. The use of his nickname in the first of the nine incidents was alone not sufficient to personalize the risk.
[11]
The RPD referenced case law and concluded that, if the risk of violence or injury or crime is a generalized risk faced by all citizens of Saint Lucia, then the fact that a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently does not mean that they are not subject to a general risk of violence. The fact that they share the same risk as other persons similarly situated does not make the risk a "personalized risk". As the risk faced by the Applicant was generalized rather than personalized, it therefore fell within the subsection 97(1)(b)(ii) exclusion.
[12]
The RPD then considered the question and principles of state protection and found that the Applicant had not rebutted the presumption, with clear and convincing evidence, of Saint Lucia's ability to protect its citizens. The Applicant had reported two incidents to the police, however he did not produce any corroborative evidence of these reports. Based on its review of the national documentation package, the RPD found that on a balance of probabilities Saint Lucia is making serious efforts to protect its citizens and while those efforts may not always be successful, that did not rebut the presumption of state protection. Further, that a claimant must approach the state for protection if such protection might be reasonably forthcoming. The Applicant had not provided a compelling explanation for failing to pursue state protection opportunities as he had approached the Saint Lucia police only once and did not approach them again during the two year period that he was involved in at least nine incidents. He had also not produced any corroborative documentary evidence, such as police reports or affidavits, to support his claim.
Issues
[13]
I would frame the issues as follows:
1. Did the RPD make an erroneous credibility finding?
2. Did the RPD err in its finding on generalized risk?
3. Did the RPD err in finding that the presumption of state protection was not rebutted?
Standard of Review
[14]
An exhaustive analysis is not required in every case to determine the proper standard of review. Courts must first ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded to a decision-maker with regard to a particular category of question (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 57 and 62 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[15]
Prior jurisprudence has established that credibility findings, sometimes described as "the heartland of the Board's jurisdiction", are in essence pure findings of fact that are reviewable on a reasonable standard ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 46;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 34).
[16]
It is well settled that the standard of review of a decision on generalized risk is also reasonableness as it is a question of mixed fact and law (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Issues of state protection and of the weighing, interpretation and assessment of evidence are reviewable on a reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[17]
In reviewing the Board's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it. It is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at para 59).
[18]
Adequacy of reasons is no longer a stand alone ground of review but is subsumed within the reasonable analysis (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 14-16 [
Newfound and Labrador Nurses' Union
]).
[19]
Accordingly, the standard of review applicable to all of the issues arising from this matter is reasonableness.
Analysis
Credibility
[20]
The Applicant submits that it was not clear from the RPD's reasons whether or not it found him to be credible. While the RPD states that the Applicant testified "in a straightforward manner," it also found that there were some relevant inconsistencies in his testimony and contradictions between his testimony and other evidence which were not satisfactorily explained. The Applicant submits that typically, straightforward testimony is consistent testimony and notes that the alleged contradictions and inconsistencies are not identified.
[21]
Further, while in paragraph 10 of its Decision the RPD found that the Applicant had not provided sufficient, critical and trustworthy evidence that he had been threatened by gang members, in paragraph 15, it found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Applicant was a victim of alleged unknown gang members and was threatened with physical harm and perhaps even death states, but that this was one of the many crimes which occurs in Saint Lucia and was not specific to the Applicant. The Applicant submits that these two inconsistent findings on credibility cannot be reconciled thereby rendering the Decision unintelligible and unreasonable. As the finding of whether the Applicant was credible or not goes to the heart of the reasons, the Decision cannot stand (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[22]
The Respondent acknowledges the inconsistency between paragraphs 10 and 15 of the Decision but submits that the RPD stated the basis for its Decision at paragraph 9 which was that the Applicant had failed to provide sufficient and credible trustworthy evidence of the alleged harm or risk and failed to provide an explanation for not having provided affidavits or letters from friends or relatives supporting his claim of threats of harm other than one letter from his mother.
[23]
Further, although the Applicant testified in a straightforward manner, this finding addresses only his manner of presentation. There are reasons to doubt his story, in large part due to a lack of evidence. Further, as the RPD rejected the claim based on an insufficiency of evidence and not on a credibility finding, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, has no application.
[24]
In my view, having regard to the whole of the RPD's reasons, it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not the RPD found the Applicant to be credible.
[25]
The RPD starts its analysis by stating that where a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. While no case law is cited, this principle is in keeping with the Court's decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at page 305.
[26]
Later, the RPD states that the claimant testified in a straightforward manner "and" that there were some relevant inconsistencies in his testimony with contradictions between his testimony and other evidence before it which had not been satisfactorily explained. Yet, the RPD does not identify these inconsistencies or contradictions which leaves open the question of how, or if, they affect the Applicant's credibility.
[27]
The fact that the Applicant testified in a "straightforward manner" may, or may not, speak to credibility. On the one hand, such a manner may suggest that the testimony being given flowed smoothly because it was truthful. On the other hand, it may simply be that an applicant practiced his or her testimony thereby achieving a straightforward manner. The point being that, without more, little can be gleaned from this statement as to the Applicant's credibility.
[28]
However, while the Decision lacks intelligibility with respect to its assessment of the Applicant's credibility, this does not affect the ultimate outcome. That is because regardless of whether the RPD found the Applicant to be credible, or not, it continued to conduct both a section 96 and 97 analysis. The Applicant does not challenge the RPD's finding or its conclusion that he is not a convention refugee as there is no nexus between his alleged fear and a section 96 convention ground.
[29]
As regards to the section 97 analysis, the RPD stated that it found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Applicant was a victim of unknown gang members and was being threatened with physical harm and perhaps even death. Thus, it must be inferred that for the purposes of its section 97 analysis, the RPD found the Applicant to be credible.
Generalized Risk
[30]
The Applicant submits that the RPD's finding of generalized risk was made without proper analysis and was therefore unreasonable.
[31]
Specifically, that the RPD failed to perform, in the manner previously proposed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, an assessment of whether the risk facing the Applicant was personalized and that its reasoning failed to take into account the true nature of the risk.
[32]
The Applicant submits that the risk was personalized as he was targeted because of his particular characterization of being well-known, making him a good candidate to be a drug dealer. The fact that the gang members called him by his nickname, "Jay", when they approached him on the first of nine occasions was an indication that he was being personally targeted. His refusal to cooperate resulted in him being placed at risk.
[33]
Further, the Applicant submits that there was no analysis of how common it is for persons from Saint Lucia to be approached to sell drugs, the repercussions for those who refuse nor was there any basis to support the RPD's view that these situations are prevalent.
[34]
The Respondent submits that the evidence tendered by the Applicant in support of his claim is limited to his testimony, his PIF, two letters from his mother, a statutory declaration concerning domestic abuse situations in Saint Lucia prepared and filed in another matter, and, the general country condition documents. The RPD reasonably found that this evidence was insufficient to support the Applicant's claim that his risk was personalized.
[35]
The Respondent also submits that the RPD did identify the risk and correctly concluded that it was generalized. The Applicant described the risk in his PIF as being threatened by drug dealers because they asked him to sell drugs for them which he refused. This is the same risk described in the RPD's reasons. Further, the RPD reasonably rejected the argument that the Applicant was subjected to heightened or personalized risk because he was called by his name on the first of nine occasions when he was approached to sell drugs. The RPD relied on the documentary evidence which established that crime relating to drug trafficking is prevalent in Saint Lucia, the risk faced by the Applicant is therefore, the same risk faced by the general population.
[36]
Further, the Respondent submits that there is no objective evidence to support the Applicant's position that his risk was personalized due to being targeted by drug dealers because he was well known and therefore would be a good drug dealer himself. This is not alleged in his PIF and his testimony was that it could be a possibility. Nor was there evidence that his refusal placed him at a higher risk.
[37]
In my view, the RPD reasonably found that the Applicant was subject to a generalized risk and, therefore, fell within the subsection 97(1)(b)(ii) exclusion.
[38]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Gleason proposed a framework for the analysis required under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA as follows:
[40] In my view, the essential starting point for the required analysis under section 97 of IRPA is to first appropriately determine the nature of the risk faced by the claimant. This requires an assessment of whether the claimant faces an ongoing or future risk (i.e. whether he or she continues to face a "personalized risk"), what the risk is, whether such risk is one of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and the basis for the risk. Frequently, in many of the recent decisions interpreting section 97 of IRPA, as noted by Justice Zinn in
Guerrero
at paras 27-28, the "... decision-makers fail to actually state the risk altogether" or "use imprecise language" to describe the risk. Many of the cases where the Board's decisions have been overturned involve determinations by this Court that the Board's characterization of the nature of the risk faced by the claimant was unreasonable and that the Board erred in conflating a highly individual reason for heightened risk faced by a claimant with a general risk of criminality faced by all or many others in the country.
[41] The next required step in the analysis under section 97 of IRPA, after the risk has been appropriately characterized, is the comparison of the correctly-described risk faced by the claimant to that faced by a significant group in the country to determine whether the risks are of the same nature and degree. If the risk is not the same, then the claimant will be entitled to protection under section 97 of IRPA. Several of the recent decisions of this Court (in the first of the above-described line of cases) adopt this approach.
[39]
The RPD's characterization of the nature of the risk was reasonable based on the evidence before it. It found that there was no persuasive evidence that the Applicant was targeted for any other reason than that he was approached by an unknown gang of men to sell drugs for them. This is consistent with the Applicant's PIF where he stated, "I have been threatened by drug dealers because they asked me to sell drugs for them and I refused to do that". At his hearing, when asked if he knew why the gang persisted for two years in their efforts to have him join them, his response was, "I'm not sure, but I would say a possible reason could be that they think I know many people". When questioned by his own counsel who asked whether the gang's initial approach in 2009, was "random" or whether he was "specifically approached", the Applicant responded that he was specifically approached because they addressed him by his nickname.
[40]
The RPD found that the Applicant was a victim of unknown gang violence and was being threatened with physical harm or perhaps even death but that this is one of the many crimes which occur in Saint Lucia and is not specific to the Applicant. Further, because he was well known in the area, the fact that he was called "Jay" at the first encounter with the gang did not, alone, constitute personalized risk since he was not called that on the following incidents.
[41]
The jurisprudence cited by the RPD supports its finding that if the risk of violence or injury is a generalized risk faced by all citizens in Saint Lucia, the fact that a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently does not mean that they are not subject to a generalized risk of violence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Innocent
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). The fact that they share the same risk as other persons similarly situated does not make the risk personalized ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 35).
[42]
It is clear that an analysis under subsection 97(1)(b)(ii) is largely contextual and entails a case-by-case determination of the particularized risk faced by a claimant (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Where the general public is subject to a risk of crime, the fact that some individuals are more exposed to the risk than others whether because of perceived wealth (
Innocent
, above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above) or because they live in more dangerous areas (
Innocent,
above) or otherwise does not necessarily make them persons in need of protection under section 97.
[43]
The jurisprudence has also recognized that a generalized risk can become personalized. In that regard, the RPD has a duty to conduct an individual and thorough analysis of the facts presented, examining all aspects of the risk stemming from those facts and determining whether the risk has become personalized even if the claimant was initially a random target.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], which is factually distinct from the present case, Justice Snider states the following:
[12] I acknowledge that, on a basic level, the Applicant is a victim of crime. However, the facts of this case are unusual in that the Applicant claims to have been personally and directly targeted by MS-18. The Board did not question the credibility of this aspect of his claim. In other words, this is not a generalized fear of being targeted by MS-18 just because the Applicant is a citizen or because of his profile as a doctor. The nature of the risk he now faces is not the same as the risk he faced prior to treating the gang member - before he treated the gang member, he was susceptible to extortion or violence, whereas now he is specifically and individually targeted for his perceived actions, unlike the general population.
[13] In virtually all of the cases cited by the Respondent, the applicants were not targeted personally per se. While the gangs may have known their names, their personal information, and may have even threatened them or assaulted them on a number of occasions, the nature of the threat was still generalized. The gang could have gone after anyone with perceived wealth, or any young person who may be recruited into their gang. These people were essentially means to an end for the gang members. I doubt that it really mattered whether person A or person B gave the gang the money for which they were searching, even if both parties were personally threatened. Similarly, I doubt that it really mattered whether person C or person D joined their cause, provided that they continued to increase their membership. The situation before me is fundamentally different. The Applicant presented a story to the Board of being at risk because he was perceived to be a person who "ratted out" an individual gang member.
[44]
The above case clearly reflects a scenario where the Applicant was specifically and individually targeted for his perceived actions, unlike the general population. However, it also establishes that just because gang members may have known a victim's name, personal information, or threatened or assaulted them on numerous occasions, is not for that reason alone sufficient to personalize the risk ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 13;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ])
.
[45]
Here, the RPD considered the only evidence offered by the Applicant as to his personalized risk, being the fact that he was well-known and that when he was initially approached, the gang referred to him by his nickname. In my view, the RPD reasonably found that this alone does not constitute personalized risk. The very fact that he was well-known, by his own evidence, would explain why they called him by his nickname and, in any event, case law has held that reference to a victim's name and personal information is insufficient by itself to render the risk personal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).
[46]
The RPD reasonably based its finding that there was no personalized risk on the lack of evidence to support that claim. As Justice Gagné stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at paras 17-18:
[17] Essentially, our case law indicates that the alleged risk may [be] personalized either because of its targeted or unusual nature (as opposed to a random and systematic risk) or because of its extent. In
Perez
, above, at paragraph 34, the Court mentioned that repetitive nature of the threats against the applicants was a continuation of the extortion and the generalized risk of violence that all citizens of the country face. Similarly in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 12-15, the Court determined that the continual threats and assaults against the applicant over an extended period of time should have been considered by the RPD before it determined that the applicant was not subjected to a risk greater than the risk faced generally by the population at large (see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In
Perez
, above, at paragraph 34, Justice Kelen distinguished Pineda by stating that unlike in that case, "[t]here is no evidence that the maras personally targeted the applicants or that they face a greater risk then other small business owners or persons perceived to be relatively wealthy".
[18] In this case, the RPD took into consideration the fact that there were multiple extortion demands that sometimes included death threats. However, it was reasonable to find that these facts were not enough to place the applicants outside the generalized risk of violence and to demonstrate that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr. Gonzalez had been targeted by a gang or likely would be in the future. The applicants did not raise any fact other than those that were noted by the RPD and have not satisfied me of how, or at what point, their risk became personalized. Given the absence of such facts, I can only find that the RPD's finding does not fall "within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[47]
That is also the situation in this case. This is not a situation where the RPD failed to consider the individual circumstances of the Applicant and, based on the evidence before it, the RPD reasonably found that the Applicant did not face personalized risk of harm but that his risk was generalized and, therefore fell, within the subsection 97(1)(b)(ii) exclusion.
[48]
As the finding on generalized risk alone is sufficient to uphold the RPD's decision, the state protection issue need not be addressed (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[49]
I also find that while the RPD made several minor errors in its Decision, such as referring to the risk as one faced generally by the population of "Hungary", reading the decision as a whole indicates that these were clerical errors insufficient to render the Decision void (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[50]
The Decision was reasonable and as such falls within the range of possible acceptable outcomes and is defensible in respect to the facts and law.
JUDGMENT
[51]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision, datée du 15 février 2013, de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié. La SPR a décidé que le demandeur n'était ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger au sens, respectivement, des articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la LIPR). La présente demande a été présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la LIPR.
Contexte
[2]
Le demandeur est citoyen de Sainte-Lucie. Il allègue qu'en mars 2009, il a été abordé par des membres d'un gang lié au trafic de stupéfiants qui lui ont demandé de vendre de la drogue pour leur compte. Il a refusé. Le lendemain, la maison de sa mère, dans laquelle il résidait, a été vandalisée. Il a signalé l'infraction à la police qui est venue à la résidence faire son enquête.
[3]
En avril 2009, il a de nouveau été arrêté par des membres du gang qui lui ont dit qu'il devrait commencer à vendre de la drogue pour eux. Une fois de plus, il a refusé. Le lendemain, la maison de sa mère a de nouveau été vandalisée, des aliments ainsi que des éléctroménagers ont été volés. Sa mère et lui sont allés faire un signalement au commissariat de police et, plus tard, ils ont effectué un suivi, mais les policiers leur ont dit qu'ils n'avaient rien à rapporter.
[4]
Ce n'est qu'un an plus tard, en avril 2010, que le demandeur a de nouveau été abordé par des membres du même gang qui l'ont embarqué et conduit dans un véhicule et lui ont, encore une fois, demandé de vendre de la drogue pour leur compte. Il a refusé et a été remis en liberté. Par la suite, il a été abordé en septembre, en octobre et en décembre 2010. En avril 2011, six membres du gang se sont présentés chez lui, les ont ligotés, sa mère et lui, et les ont menacé de mort s'il refusait de vendre de la drogue pour eux.
[5]
À la suite de cet incident, sa mère a immédiatement déménagé dans une autre ville. Le demandeur a continué son travail, mais il ne dormait plus chez lui, il séjournait plutôt chez différents membres de sa famille. Le demandeur est arrivé au Canada le 29 septembre 2011 et a demandé l'asile le 8 novembre 2011.
[6]
Dans sa décision datée du 15 février 2013, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'avait ni la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger au sens, respectivement, de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR (la décision).
Décision soumise au contrôle
[7]
Selon la SPR, le demandeur a témoigné avec franchise, et il y avait quelques incohérences d'importance dans son témoignage et des contradictions entre celui-ci et d'autres éléments de preuve qui n'ont pas été expliquées de manière satisfaisante. En ce qui a trait aux menaces contre lui, le demandeur n'a produit aucun affidavit, aucune lettre ni autre preuve documentaire corroborante, sauf une lettre de sa mère. Il n'a pas non plus produit de rapport de police corroborant ses signalements des deux entrées par effraction; selon son témoignage, il a tenté de les obtenir, mais la police ne les lui a pas remis. La SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas produit « suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi » selon lesquels il avait fait l'objet de menaces par les membres du gang.
[8]
La SPR a conclu qu'en l'espèce, la crainte du demandeur n'était pas liée à la race, à la religion, à la nationalité, aux opinions politiques ou à l'appartenance à un groupe social. Il était victime d'actes criminels, ce qui ne permet pas d'établir de lien entre sa crainte de persécution et l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention. Par conséquent, sa demande au titre de l'article 96 a été refusée.
[9]
Ensuite, la SPR a examiné la question de savoir si le préjudice craint par le demandeur était tel qu'il constituait une menace à sa vie, un risque de traitements ou de peines cruels et inusités, ce qui ferait de lui une personne à protéger au sens de l'alinéa 97(1)
b
) de la LIPR. La SPR a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur avait été victime de membres d'un gang inconnu et avait reçu des menaces de blessures, voire de mort, mais qu'il s'agissait d'un crime parmi tant d'autres qui sont perpétrés à Sainte-Lucie, et que le demandeur d'asile n'en était pas une victime particulière.
[10]
La SPR a conclu que le fait que, la première fois où les membres du gang avaient abordé le demandeur, l'un d'entre eux l'avait appelé par son surnom, « Jay », ne rendait pas le risque personnalisé, en particulier parce que, selon le témoignage du demandeur, il était très connu dans le secteur. L'utilisation de son surnom lors du premier des neuf incidents n'était pas en soi suffisante pour personnaliser le risque.
[11]
La SPR a fait référence à la jurisprudence et a conclu que, si le risque de violence, de blessure ou de crime est un risque généralisé auquel sont exposés tous les citoyens de Sainte-Lucie, alors le fait que certaines personnes en particulier puissent être prises pour cibles plus fréquemment ne signifie pas qu'elles ne sont pas exposées à un « risque généralisé » de violence. Le fait qu'elles sont exposées au même risque que d'autres personnes dans une situation semblable ne signifie pas qu'elles sont « personnellement exposées à un risque ». Vu que le risque auquel le demandeur était exposé était généralisé et non pas personnalisé, la SPR a donc conclu que le risque relevait de l'exclusion prévue au sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii).
[12]
La SPR a ensuite examiné la question de la protection de l'État et les principes y afférents, et elle a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas réfuté, à l'aide d'éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants, la présomption selon laquelle Sainte-Lucie était en mesure de protéger ses citoyens. Le demandeur a signalé deux incidents à la police, toutefois, il n'a produit aucun élément de preuve corroborant ces signalements. Sur la foi de son appréciation du contenu du cartable national de documentation, la SPR a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, Sainte-Lucie faisait de sérieux efforts pour protéger ses citoyens, et que, bien que ces efforts ne soient pas toujours couronnés de succès, cela ne suffisait pas à réfuter la présomption de la protection de l'État. En outre, un demandeur doit s'adresser à l'État pour obtenir sa protection dans les cas où cette protection pourrait raisonnablement être assurée. Le demandeur n'a pas fourni d'explication impérieuse pour ne pas avoir sollicité la protection de l'État, étant donné qu'il avait abordé la police de Sainte-Lucie seulement une fois, et qu'il ne l'avait pas refait au cours de la période de deux ans où il avait été mêlé à au moins neuf incidents. Aussi, il n'avait fourni aucune preuve documentaire corroborante, telle que des rapports de police ou des affidavits à l'appui de sa demande.
Questions en litige
[13]
Je formulerais les questions en litige de la façon suivante:
1. La SPR a-t-elle erronément tiré une conclusion relative à la crédibilité?
2. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans sa conclusion relative au risque généralisé?
3. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que la présomption de la protection de l'État n'avait pas été réfutée?
Norme de contrôle
[14]
Il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de se livrer à une analyse exhaustive pour arrêter la bonne norme de contrôle. La cour de révision vérifie d'abord si la jurisprudence établit déjà de manière satisfaisante le degré de déférence qui doit être accordée à un décideur et qui correspond à une catégorie de questions en particulier (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 57 et 62 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53, [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[15]
La jurisprudence antérieure a établi que les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité, parfois décrites comme étant [traduction] « l'essentiel de la compétence de la Commission », sont par nature de pures conclusions de fait susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 46;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[16]
Il est bien établi que la norme de contrôle d'une décision portant sur le risque généralisé est aussi la décision raisonnable, étant donné qu'il s'agit d'une question mixte de fait et de droit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
De Jesus Aleman Aguilar
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Les questions qui concernent la protection de l'État et la pondération, l'interprétation et l'appréciation de la preuve commandent la norme de la décision raisonnable(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[17]
Lorsqu'elle contrôle la décision rendue par la Commission selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la Commission est arrivée à une conclusion qui n'est pas transparente, justifiable et intelligible et qui n'appartient pas aux issues acceptables au vu de la preuve qui lui était soumise. La cour de révision ne peut substituer à l'issue qui a été retenue celle qui serait à son avis préférable; il ne rentre pas non plus dans ses attributions de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 59).
[18]
Le caractère adéquat des motifs n'est plus un motif de contrôle isolé, mais il est inclus dans l'analyse de la décision raisonnable (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 14 à 16, [
Newfound and Labrador Nurses' Union
]).
[19]
Par conséquent, la norme de contrôle applicable à toutes les questions en litige soulevées en l'espèce est la décision raisonnable.
Analyse
Crédibilité
[20]
Le demandeur soutient que les motifs de la SPR n'étaient pas clairs quant à savoir si elle avait conclu qu'il était crédible ou non. Bien que la SPR ait déclaré que le demandeur avait témoigné « avec franchise », elle a aussi conclu qu'il y avait quelques incohérences d'importance dans son témoignage et des contradictions entre celui-ci et d'autres éléments de preuve qui n'ont pas été expliquées de façon raisonnable. Selon le demandeur, en général un témoignage donné avec franchise est un témoignage cohérent et il souligne que les contradictions alléguées et les incohérences ne sont pas décrites.
[21]
En outre, bien qu'au paragraphe 10 de sa décision, la SPR ait conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas fourni suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi à l'appui de ses allégations selon lesquelles il faisait l'objet de menaces de la part des membres du gang, au paragraphe 15, elle a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur avait été une victime des présumés membres d'un gang inconnu et avait reçu des menaces de blessure, voire même de mort, mais qu'il s'agissait d'un crime parmi tant d'autres qui sont perpétrés à Sainte-Lucie, et que le demandeur n'en était pas une victime particulière. Le demandeur soutient que ces deux conclusions incohérentes relatives à sa crédibilité ne peuvent pas être conciliées, ce qui rend donc la décision inintelligible et déraisonnable. Étant donné que la conclusion portant sur la question de savoir si le demandeur était crédible ou non est au cœur même des motifs, la décision ne peut pas être maintenue (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[22]
Le défendeur reconnaît l'existence d'incohérences entre les paragraphes 10 et 15 de la décision, mais il soutient que la SPR a exposé le bien-fondé de sa décision au paragraphe 9, duquel il ressort que le demandeur n'avait pas produit suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi relativement au préjudice allégué ou aux menaces, et qu'il n'avait pas fourni d'explication de la raison pour laquelle il n'avait pas donné d'affidavits, ou de lettres d'amis ou de membres de sa famille à l'appui de son allégation de menaces de préjudice, sauf une lettre de sa mère.
[23]
En outre, bien que le demandeur ait témoigné avec franchise, cette conclusion a seulement trait à sa façon de se présenter. Il y a des raisons de douter de son récit, en grande partie en raison du manque de preuve. En outre, la SPR a rejeté la demande pour insuffisance de preuve, et non pas en raison d'une conclusion relative à la crédibilité, la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, ne s'applique pas.
[24]
Selon moi, lorsqu'on tient compte des motifs de la SPR dans leur ensemble, il n'est pas possible de déterminer avec certitude si la SPR a conclu que le demandeur était crédible ou non.
[25]
La SPR a commencé son analyse par une déclaration selon laquelle, lorsqu'un demandeur d'asile jure que certaines allégations sont vraies, cela crée une présomption qu'elles le sont, à moins qu'il n'existe des raisons d'en douter. Bien qu'aucune jurisprudence ne soit citée, ce principe concorde avec la décision de la Cour dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, à la page 305.
[26]
Plus bas, la SPR déclare que le demandeur a témoigné avec franchise « et » qu'il y avait quelques incohérences d'importance dans son témoignage et des contradictions entre celui-ci et d'autres éléments de preuve dont elle disposait et qui n'ont pas été expliquées de façon raisonnable. Pourtant, la SPR ne décrit pas ces incohérences ou contradictions, ce qui laisse la voie ouverte à la question de savoir comment, ou si, elles ont nui à la crédibilité du demandeur.
[27]
Le fait que le demandeur ait témoigné « avec franchise » peut ou peut ne pas illustrer la crédibilité. D'une part, une telle manière peut donner à penser que le témoignage donné s'enchaînait bien parce qu'il était honnête. D'autre part, il se pourrait simplement qu'un demandeur ait pratiqué son témoignage parvenant ainsi à témoigner avec franchise. Il en ressort que, sans renseignements supplémentaires, cette déclaration éclaire peu en ce qui concerne la crédibilité du demandeur.
[28]
Toutefois, bien que la décision manque d'intelligibilité en ce qui a trait à l'appréciation de la crédibilité du demandeur, cela n'a pas de conséquence sur l'issue finale. Il en est ainsi parce que, peu importe si la SPR avait conclu que le demandeur était crédible ou non, elle a continué à effectuer son analyse tant pour l'article 96 que pour l'article 97. Le demandeur ne conteste ni la conclusion de la SPR ni sa décision selon lesquelles il n'est pas un réfugié au sens de la Convention, parce qu'il n'y avait pas de lien entre sa crainte alléguée et l'un des motifs de la Convention mentionnés à l'article 96.
[29]
En ce qui a trait à l'analyse relative à l'article 97, la SPR a déclaré qu'elle concluait que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur avait été victime de membres d'un gang inconnu et avait reçu des menaces de blessures, voire de mort. Ainsi, on doit tirer l'inférence que, pour son analyse relative à l'article 97, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur était crédible.
Risque généralisé
[30]
Le demandeur soutient que la conclusion de la SPR relative au risque généralisé a été tirée sans analyse adéquate, et qu'elle était donc déraisonnable.
[31]
En particulier, la SPR n'a pas effectué, de la façon proposée antérieurement dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, une appréciation de la question de savoir si le risque auquel le demandeur était exposé était personnalisé, et son raisonnement n'a pas pris en compte la véritable nature du risque.
[32]
Le demandeur soutient que le risque était personnalisé, étant donné qu'il était pris pour cible en raison de sa qualification de personne bien connue, ce qui faisait de lui un bon candidat pour le trafic de stupéfiants. Le fait que les membres du gang l'ont appelé par son surnom « Jay », lorsqu'ils l'ont abordé la première des neuf fois, était une indication qu'il était pris pour cible personnellement. Son refus de coopérer a entraîné son exposition au risque.
[33]
En outre, le demandeur soutient qu'il n'y avait pas d'analyse du caractère courant pour les résidants de Sainte-Lucie d'être abordés pour vendre des stupéfiants, des répercussions sur les personnes qui refusent, ni de fondement à l'appui du point de vue de la SPR selon lequel ces situations étaient courantes.
[34]
Le défendeur soutient que la preuve produite par le demandeur à l'appui de sa demande est limitée à son témoignage, son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP), deux lettres de sa mère, une déclaration solennelle concernant des situations de violence conjugale à Sainte-Lucie, préparée et déposée dans une autre affaire, et des documents généraux sur la situation dans le pays. La SPR a raisonnablement conclu que cette preuve était insuffisante pour étayer l'allégation du demandeur selon laquelle son risque était personnalisé.
[35]
Le défendeur soutient aussi que la SPR a décrit le risque, et correctement conclu qu'il était généralisé. Dans son FRP, le demandeur a décrit le risque comme étant des menaces par des trafiquants de drogue, parce qu'ils lui avaient demandé de vendre des stupéfiants pour leur compte et qu'il avait refusé. C'est le même risque que celui qui est décrit dans les motifs de la SPR. En outre, la SPR a raisonnablement rejeté l'argument selon lequel le demandeur faisait l'objet d'un risque élevé ou personnalisé, parce qu'il avait été appelé par son nom la première des neuf fois au cours desquelles il avait été abordé pour vendre des stupéfiants. La SPR s'est fondée sur la preuve documentaire, laquelle établissait que les crimes liés au trafic de drogue étaient prédominants à Sainte-Lucie, le risque auquel était exposé le demandeur était donc le même risque que celui auquel était exposée la population en général.
[36]
En outre, le défendeur soutient qu'il n'y a pas de preuve objective à l'appui de la position du demandeur selon laquelle son risque était personnalisé, car il était pris pour cible par les trafiquants de drogue parce qu'il était une personne bien connue, et, par conséquent, il serait un bon trafiquant de stupéfiants. Cette allégation ne ressort pas de son FRP, et selon son témoignage, cela pouvait être une possibilité. Il n'y avait pas non plus de preuve que son refus l'exposait à un risque très élevé.
[37]
Selon moi, la SPR a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur était exposé à un risque généralisé et, par conséquent, qu'il était visé par l'exclusion prévue au sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii).
[38]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la juge Gleason a proposé le cadre suivant pour l'analyse requise en vertu du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR de la façon suivante:
[40] À mon avis, le point de départ essentiel de l'analyse relative à l'article 97 de la LIPR consiste à définir correctement la nature du risque auquel le demandeur est exposé. Pour ce faire, il faut déterminer si le demandeur est exposé à un risque persistant ou à venir (c.-à-d. s'il continue à être exposé à un « risque personnalisé »), quel est le risque en question et s'il consiste à être exposé à des traitements ou à des peines cruels et inusités et, enfin, le fondement de ce risque. Fréquemment, dans plusieurs décisions récentes dans lesquelles notre Cour a interprété l'article 97 de la LIPR, ainsi que le juge Zinn le fait observer dans le jugement
Guerrero
, aux paragraphes 27 et 28, « [...] trop de décideurs omettent totalement d'énoncer [le] risque » auquel le demandeur est exposé ou « [...] restent [...] souvent vagues à cet égard ». Dans bon nombre des affaires dans lesquelles elle a annulé la décision de la Commission, notre Cour a estimé que la façon dont celle-ci avait qualifié la nature du risque auquel était exposé le demandeur d'asile était déraisonnable et que la Commission avait commis une erreur en confondant un risque plus élevé lié à une raison très personnelle avec un risque général de criminalité auquel l'ensemble ou une bonne partie de la population était exposée dans un pays déterminé.
[41] L'étape suivante à franchir dans le cadre de l'analyse prévue à l'article 97 de la LIPR, une fois que le risque a été correctement qualifié, consiste à comparer le risque qui a été correctement décrit et auquel le demandeur d'asile est exposé, avec celui auquel est exposée une partie importante de la population de son pays pour déterminer si ces risques sont similaires de par leur nature et leur gravité. Si le risque qu'il court est différent, le demandeur d'asile a alors le droit de se réclamer de la protection de l'article 97 de la LIPR. Plusieurs des décisions récentes de notre Cour - s'inscrivant dans le premier courant jurisprudentiel susmentionné- ont retenu cette approche.
[39]
Sur la foi de la preuve dont elle disposait, la façon dont la SPR a qualifié la nature du risque était raisonnable. Elle a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve convaincante que le demandeur était pris pour cible pour toute autre raison que le fait qu'il avait été abordé par des hommes d'un gang inconnu pour vendre des stupéfiants pour leur compte. Cela est cohérent avec le FRP du demandeur, dans lequel il a déclaré [traduction] « J'ai été menacé par des trafiquants de stupéfiants parce qu'ils m'ont demandé de vendre de la drogue pour leur compte et que j'ai refusé de le faire ». À l'audience, lorsqu'on lui a demandé s'il savait pourquoi le gang a persisté pendant deux années dans ses efforts de le voir se joindre à eux, sa réponse fut [traduction] « Je ne suis pas sûr, mais je dirais qu'une raison possible peut être le fait qu'ils croyaient que je connaissais beaucoup de monde ». Lorsque son conseil l'a interrogé afin de savoir si la première fois que le gang l'avait abordé en 2009 était le fait du [traduction] « hasard » ou s'il avait été [traduction] « abordé en particulier », le demandeur a répondu qu'il avait été abordé en particulier parce qu'ils s'étaient adressés à lui par son surnom.
[40]
La SPR a conclu que le demandeur avait été victime de la violence des membres d'un gang inconnu et avait reçu des menaces de blessures, voire de mort, mais qu'il s'agissait d'un crime parmi tant d'autres qui sont perpétrés à Sainte-Lucie, et que le demandeur n'en était pas une victime particulière. En outre, parce qu'il était bien connu dans le secteur, le fait qu'il avait été appelé « Jay » à la première rencontre avec le gang ne constituait pas, en soi, un risque personnalisé, étant donné qu'il n'avait pas été appelé ainsi lors des incidents suivants.
[41]
La jurisprudence citée par la SPR étaye sa conclusion selon laquelle le risque de violence ou de blessure est un risque généralisé auquel sont exposés tous les citoyens à Sainte-Lucie, le fait qu'un nombre précis de personnes puissent plus fréquemment être prises pour cibles ne signifie pas qu'elles ne font pas l'objet d'un risque généralisé de violence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Innocent
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Le fait que ces personnes partagent le même risque que d'autres personnes dans des situations semblables ne rend pas ce risque personnalisé ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 35).
[42]
Il est clair qu'une analyse, au titre du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii), est grandement contextuelle et qu'elle entraîne des décisions au cas par cas sur le risque personnalisé auquel est exposé un demandeur (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Lorsque le public en général est exposé à un risque de crime, le fait que certaines personnes sont plus exposées au risque que d'autres, que ce soit en raison de leur richesse perçue (
Innocent
, précitée; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée) ou parce qu'elles habitent des quartiers plus dangereux (
Innocent,
précitée) ne rend pas ces personnes nécessairement admissibles au statut de personnes à protéger en vertu de l'article 97.
[43]
La jurisprudence a aussi reconnu qu'un risque généralisé peut devenir personnalisé. À cet égard, la SPR a l'obligation de mener une analyse individuelle et approfondie des faits qui lui sont présentés, elle doit examiner tous les aspects du risque qui prennent racine dans ces faits, et elle doit déterminer si le risque est devenu personnalisé, même si au départ, le demandeur était pris pour cible au hasard. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], dont les faits sont distincts de la présente espèce, la juge Snider a déclaré ce qui suit:
[12] Je reconnais que, fondamentalement, le demandeur est une victime de crime. Toutefois, les faits de l'espèce sont inhabituels en ce que le demandeur prétend avoir été personnellement et directement la cible du MS-18. La Commission n'a pas mis en doute sa crédibilité sur ce point. Dans d'autres termes, il ne s'agit pas ici d'une crainte généralisée d'être la cible du MS-18 du seul fait que le demandeur est un citoyen ou en raison de son profil de médecin. Le risque auquel il est maintenant exposé n'est pas de même nature que celui auquel il faisait face avant d'avoir soigné un membre du gang - avant de traiter le membre du gang, il était exposé à l'extorsion ou la violence, alors qu'il est aujourd'hui spécifiquement et individuellement ciblé en raison de ses agissements perçus, contrairement à la population en général.
[13] Dans pratiquement toutes les affaires citées par le défendeur, les demandeurs n'étaient pas ciblés personnellement. Les gangs connaissaient peut-être leurs noms, des renseignements personnels à leur sujet, et les avaient peut-être menacés ou agressés à un certain nombre de reprises, la nature de la menace n'en demeurait pas moins généralisée. Le gang aurait pu s'en prendre à quiconque avait selon lui une certaine fortune, ou à tout jeune susceptible d'être recruté comme membre. Pour les membres du gang, ces personnes étaient essentiellement un moyen pour atteindre une fin. Que la personne A ou la personne B ait donné l'argent que le gang cherchait, je doute que cela ait eu de l'importance, même si les deux parties avaient personnellement reçu des menaces. Dans le même ordre d'idées, je doute que cela change quelque chose si c'est la personne C ou la personne D qui adhère à la cause, pourvu que l'effectif du gang continue d'augmenter. Dans la présente espèce, la situation est fondamentalement différente. Le demandeur a dit à la Commission qu'il était exposé à un risque parce qu'il était perçu comme quelqu'un qui avait dénoncé un membre du gang.
[44]
La décision ci-dessus reflète clairement le scénario dans lequel le demandeur était particulièrement et individuellement pris pour cible pour ses actions perçues, contrairement à la population en général. Toutefois, cette décision établit aussi que, uniquement parce que les membres d'un gang peuvent connaître le nom d'une victime, des renseignements personnels à son sujet, et l'avaient peut-être menacée ou agressée à un certain nombre de reprises, ce ne sont pas là des raisons suffisantes en soi pour personnaliser le risque ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 13;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ])
.
[45]
En l'espèce, la SPR a pris en compte la seule preuve produite par le demandeur relativement à son risque personnalisé, soit le fait qu'il était très connu, et que lorsqu'il a été abordé la première fois, le gang l'a appelé par son surnom. Selon moi, la SPR a raisonnablement conclu qu'en soi, cela ne constituait pas un risque personnalisé. Le fait même qu'il était très connu, selon sa propre preuve, expliquerait pourquoi ils l'ont appelé par son surnom, et, quoi qu'il en soit, la jurisprudence a décidé que la référence au nom d'une victime et aux renseignements personnels n'est pas suffisante en soi pour personnaliser le risque ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée).
[46]
La SPR a raisonnablement fondé sa conclusion selon laquelle il n'y avait pas de risque personnalisé sur le manque de preuve à l'appui de cette allégation. Comme la juge Gagné l'a déclaré aux paragraphes 17 et 18 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]:
[17] Essentiellement, il ressort de notre jurisprudence que le risque allégué peut être personnalisé soit de par sa nature ciblée et inhabituelle (par opposition à un risque aléatoire et systématique), soit de par son étendue. Dans
Perez
, précitée, au para 34, la Cour a mentionné que le caractère répétitif des menaces dont avait fait l'objet le demandeur constituait plutôt une prolongation de l'extorsion et de la violence généralisée dont tous les habitants de son pays pouvaient faire l'objet. De la même façon dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, aux para 12-15, la Cour a jugé que les menaces insistantes et les agressions dont le demandeur avait été victime pendant une période prolongée devaient être prises en compte par la SPR avant qu'elle décide que le demandeur n'était pas exposé à un risque supérieur à celui auquel était exposée la population en général (voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Dans
Perez
, précitée, au para 34, le juge Kelen a distingué <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> en mentionnant que contrairement à cette dernière, « rien ne donne à penser que les
marahs
avaient ciblé personnellement les demandeurs ou que les demandeurs étaient exposés à un plus grand risque que les autres propriétaires de petites entreprises ou les autres personnes considérées comme étantrelativement riches ».
[18] En l'espèce, la SPR a tenu compte du fait que les demandes d'extorsion étaient multiples et parfois accompagnées de menaces de mort. Cependant, il lui était loisible de conclure que ces faits étaient insuffisants pour situer les demandeurs en dehors du cadre du risque généralisé de violence et pour démontrer que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, M. Gonzalez avait été ciblé par un gang ou risquait de l'être dans le futur. Les demandeurs n'ont soulevé aucun fait autre que ceux qui ont été notés par la SPR et ne m'ont pas convaincue en quoi, ou à partir de quel moment, leur risque serait devenu personnalisé. En l'absence de tels faits, je ne puis conclure que la conclusion de la SPR n'appartient pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[47]
C'est aussi le cas en l'espèce. Nous ne sommes pas en présence d'une situation dans laquelle la SPR n'a pas pris en compte les circonstances individuelles du demandeur; et, sur la foi de la preuve dont elle disposait, elle a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur n'était pas exposé à un risque personnel de préjudice, mais que son risque était généralisé, et, par conséquent, qu'il était visé par l'exclusion prévue au sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii).
[48]
Étant donné que la conclusion relative au risque généralisé est suffisante en soi pour maintenir la décision de la SPR, la question de la protection de l'État n'a pas à être examinée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[49]
Je conclus aussi que bien que la SPR ait commis plusieurs erreurs mineures dans sa décision, telles que le fait de se référer au risque comme étant celui auquel est généralement exposée la population de la « Hongrie », lorsqu'on lit la décision dans son ensemble, il en ressort qu'il s'agit d'erreurs d'écriture qui sont insuffisantes pour entraîner l'annulation de la décision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[50]
La décision était raisonnable, et ainsi, elle appartenait aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
