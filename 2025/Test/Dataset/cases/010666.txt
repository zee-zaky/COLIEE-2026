[1]
O'Keefe, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision by the pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) officer (the officer) dated February 10, 2012, wherein the applicant's PRRA application was refused. The officer's decision was based on the finding that the applicant would not be subject to risk of persecution, danger of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Mexico.
[2]
The applicant requests that the officer's decision be set aside and the application be referred for redetermination by a different officer.
Background
[3]
The applicant is a citizen of Mexico. He was targeted due to a feud between his own family and the Cepeda family. In January 2007, he was abducted and suffered a number of beatings, sexual assaults and a mock execution, which caused him permanent physical injury and severe mental and emotional problems. His brother fled Mexico for the United States. He asked the police for assistance but they appeared to be allied with the Cepeda family. The applicant and his wife fled to Ario de Rosales, but were found by the Cepeda family. They then fled to Tijuana, where they were attacked by gangsters. They then fled in turn to Mexico City for five days before leaving the country.
[4]
The applicant came to Canada on May 6, 2007. He claimed refugee protection on May 14, 2007, but his claim was ultimately abandoned because he did not attend hearings due to a major depressive paranoid episode requiring hospitalization. He fears returning to Mexico due to violence at the hands of the Cepeda family, a threat compounded by his physical and mental health problems and the resulting inability to access social services.
[5]
He made a PRRA application on May 17, 2011.
Officer's PRRA Decision
[6]
In a letter dated February 10, 2012, the officer informed the applicant his application had been rejected.
[7]
The reasons began by summarizing the risks identified by the applicant and his immigration status history. The officer noted the documentary evidence submitted by the applicant, including medical records and the applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative from his refugee claim.
[8]
The officer then turned to the evaluation of the risks alleged by the applicant. The officer described how the applicant feared retribution by the Cepeda family due to failing to pay protection money. The officer concluded the applicant had not demonstrated that this feud was ongoing or that his alleged persecution had a nexus to the Convention grounds under section 96 of the Act, as victims of crime are not a particular social group.
[9]
The officer therefore considered the applicant's claim under section 97 of the Act, noting that risks caused by the inability of Mexico to provide the applicant with adequate health or medical care were excluded from consideration under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv). The officer described how the applicant feared being beaten, raped and killed by the Cepeda family and his claim that he had no internal flight alternative (IFA) in Mexico due to his persecutors being able to find him anywhere in the country. The officer concluded that the applicant's problems were local in nature and he had not demonstrated that his persecutors would still be interested in him as the crimes in question had been committed in January 2007.
[10]
The officer then considered the applicant's flight to Ario de Rosales. The applicant did not explain why he chose to flee to an area where he knew the Cepeda family lived or why the encounter with the Cepedas was a result of the family pursuing him instead of a random encounter. The applicant did not provide detailed information regarding the confrontation, including whether complaints where made to the police.
[11]
The officer considered the applicant's further flight to Tijuana. The officer noted the applicant did not allege the attack by gangsters in that city was linked to the other attacks by the Cepedas and reported no other problems while living in Tijuana. The applicant had not explained why this criminal act resulted in the decision to flee to Mexico City.
[12]
The officer described the applicant's evidence with regard to his wife, who originally came with him to Canada but had since returned to Mexico. The applicant alleged that upon return to Mexico, his wife was threatened by someone who asked about the applicant's whereabouts. The officer concluded the details about this event, such as the date, location and identity of the attacker were lacking. The officer also concluded the applicant's evidence of members of his family being victims of crime were the result of general criminality and not linked to the Cepeda family. The applicant had not provided evidence of his brother's status in the United States or whether he had claimed refugee protection. The officer concluded on a balance of probabilities that the reasons for the applicant's past mistreatment no longer existed. The officer also concluded there was insufficient evidence to conclude that there were police officers among the applicant's attackers during the 2007 attack.
[13]
The officer acknowledged the medical problems that the applicant suffered from but concluded that this would not affect the applicant's ability to access social services in Mexico. The officer noted the applicant had previously received medical treatment in Mexico after the 2007 attack and had relatives in the country to support him. Therefore, the officer rejected the applicant's argument that IFA was not available.
[14]
Finally, the officer noted the country conditions documents pertaining to criminality and corruption in Mexico, but concluded that they did not provide any evidence of the applicant's personal situation or the risks that he would face upon return.
Issues
[15]
The applicant submits the following point at issue:
1. Is the decision reasonable?
[16]
I would rephrase the issues as follows:
1. What is the appropriate standard of review?
2. Did the officer err in denying the application?
Applicant's Written Submissions
[17]
The applicant submits the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness.
[18]
The first error alleged by the applicant is that the officer mischaracterizes the relevance of the applicant's health problems. The applicant had argued that his physical and mental health problems contributed to his inability to access whatever state protection may be available. The officer analyzed the health problems as a source of risk upon return to Mexico, instead of a fact that adversely affected his ability to avoid that risk by state protection or IFA.
[19]
The second error is the officer's misreading of the evidence relating to the Cepeda family's interest in the applicant. The officer focused on the 2007 incident and ignored the applicant's evidence relating to the more significant family feud, including the murder of his uncle for refusing to sell prescription drugs to the Cepedas. The officer's conclusion the Cepeda family no longer threatened the applicant was based on a selective view of the evidence.
[20]
Third, the officer should have considered whether there were compelling reasons arising out of the applicant's previous persecution for him not to return to Mexico. This inquiry applies to a claim under sections 96 or 97 and is not dependant upon nexus. The officer has a duty to consider the compelling reasons exception even if it was not raised by a claimant. The applicant's mental health issues should have been considered as compelling reasons.
[21]
Fourth, the officer was wrong to conclude the applicant faced a generalized risk, given the evidence he had been personally and repeatedly targeted. The fact that a risk arises from criminal activity does not in itself foreclose the possibility of protection under section 97.
[22]
Fifth, the officer was wrong to conclude an IFA was available to the applicant because the extensive health care evidence filed shows that his mental state would have prevented him from having an IFA in Mexico or accessing the necessary support. The officer also ignored the applicant's submission that social and medical services in Mexico would only be available if the applicant were employed, which would not be possible given his medical and mental state. The officer does not identify an IFA locale or the state protection mechanisms available in such an IFA.
[23]
Sixth, the applicant has not claimed protection because he would not get the appropriate health care in Mexico. The applicant never stated that the risk was caused by the lack of health care. Rather, his condition renders him unable to access the care he needs and he is unable to access state protection.
[24]
Finally, the officer failed to address state protection and made no finding on the matter.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[25]
The respondent argues that the applicant has no nexus to the Convention grounds as a victim of crime. The applicant's alleged problem with his persecutors only began after he refused to pay protection money. The application record does not disclose any corroborating evidence of the applicant's allegations of a long-running family feud.
[26]
The respondent argues that past persecution is a relevant factor, but not determinative of a future-looking fear. The applicant did not submit adequate evidence to demonstrate he would still be at risk if he returned to Mexico. The officer found that the events were local in nature and that the extortion incidents indicative of a generalized risk of criminality.
[27]
The officer found that the applicant failed to satisfactorily explain why he chose to flee to an area where he knew the Cepeda family lived and had not established that the incident in Ario de Rosales was not the result of a random encounter. There was no indication the police were contacted. The officer found the criminal attack in Tijuana to be unrelated to the Cepeda family. The applicant submitted no objective evidence showing his family members had been targeted by the Cepeda family, so it was reasonable to conclude they were victims of a generalized risk.
[28]
The respondent points out the applicant failed to rebut the presumption of state protection. The applicant had a higher burden given Mexico's status as a democratic society. In this case, the one time that the applicant claims to have sought police help, the police were not able to conduct a full investigation because the applicant could only identify one of his assailants. The applicant stated a forensic doctor examined him and took notes, but provided no forensic or police report. The officer found the applicant did not establish police were involved in the 2007 attack. There was no indication the applicant took any further steps to seek state protection, including in Ario de Rosales, Tijuana or Mexico City. A failure to pursue state protection in a democracy like Mexico will usually be fatal to a refugee claim. A number of recent Mexican state protection cases have held that it is insufficient for an applicant to solely rely on documentary evidence if he has failed to avail himself of state protection.
[29]
The officer plainly realized that the applicant's medical condition was a secondary factor and not part of the risk being alleged. The officer reasonably concluded that the applicant was able to access medical and social services in Mexico. The officer properly excluded consideration of medical care as required by section 97.
Applicant's Reply Submissions
[30]
The applicant argues the respondent attempts to defend the officer's decision based on a basis other than the decision actually rendered. The respondent argues that the record does not disclose objective evidence of the family feud, but the officer did not find that this history was untrue and did not require such evidence. Sworn testimony is to be believed unless there is good reason not to.
[31]
The applicant argues the respondent's memorandum contains many other arguments made by the respondent based on the record that did not appear in the officer's decision. The officer undertook no state protection analysis.
[32]
The applicant argues the central finding of the officer was that the mistreatment of the applicant was a one-time event which contributed to the finding of generalized risk. While an inter-family blood feud may not give rise to nexus, it was certainly not an isolated occurrence.
Analysis and Decision
Issue 1
What is the appropriate standard of review?
[33]
Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[34]
It is trite law that the standard of review of PRRA decisions is reasonableness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 980 at paragraph 11; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 52 at paragraph 11). Similarly, issues of state protection and of the weighing, interpretation and assessment of evidence are reviewable on a reasonableness standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 924 at paragraph 5; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1286 at paragraph 38).
[35]
In reviewing the officer's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the officer came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47 and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraph 59).
Issue 2
Did the officer err in denying the application?
[36]
The officer is presumed to have considered all of the evidence before him (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ No 411). However, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned, the more willing a court may be to infer from silence that the officer made a finding of fact without regard to the evidence (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 189).
[37]
In this case, the central risk alleged by the applicant was a long running family feud. The officer makes no finding that the feud did not exist or that the applicant's evidence lacked credibility. Instead, the officer notes the applicant had not demonstrated the feud was ongoing or that he had been victimized prior to the incident precipitating his flight from Mexico.
[38]
Despite implicitly accepting the existence of the feud, at least in the past, the officer's risk analysis is only concerned with the individual incident relating to the applicant's failure to provide protection money. The officer notes "[the applicant's] problems in Mexico were local in nature ... [t] he crimes committed in January 2007 are over now" and expresses skepticism that the criminals who kidnapped him would still be interested in him on the basis of failing to pay protection money. The officer's analysis of whether the applicant's persecutors would follow him elsewhere in Mexico also makes no mention of the family feud, so is presumably based only on the protection money incident.
[39]
In considering the applicant's evidence relating to his family members, the officer concluded that they were general victims of crime in Mexico, as the applicant had not provided details such as whether the perpetrators were members of the Cepeda family. This ignores the applicant's PIF narrative which clearly states that the murder of his father and beating of his brother were perpetrated by that family.
[40]
It is not this Court's role to reweigh evidence. It is the officer's role, however, to properly consider the evidence submitted by the applicant. Here, the applicant's evidence that the risk he faced was rooted in a violent family feud. The officer did not consider that evidence when evaluating the likelihood that the applicant would face risks upon returning to Mexico.
[41]
This brings the officer's decision into conflict with the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, values of transparency and justification. For that reason, I would grant the application and remit the matter to a different officer for redetermination.
[42]
Neither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.
JUDGMENT
[43]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred to a different officer for redetermination.

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée conformément au paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), à l'encontre de la décision, datée du 10 février 2012, rendue par un agent (l'agent) chargé de l'examen des risques avant renvoi (l'ERAR), qui a rejeté la demande d'ERAR du demandeur. La décision de l'agent reposait sur la conclusion selon laquelle le demandeur ne serait pas exposé au risque de persécution ou de torture, à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités s'il était renvoyé au Mexique.
[2]
Le demandeur sollicite l'annulation de la décision de l'agent et le renvoi de sa demande à un autre agent pour qu'il statue à nouveau sur celle-ci.
Contexte
[3]
Le demandeur est un citoyen du Mexique. Il a été pris pour cible en raison d'un conflit entre sa famille et la famille Cepeda. En janvier 2007, il a été enlevé, battu plusieurs fois, agressé sexuellement et soumis à un simulacre d'exécution, ce qui lui causé des blessures physiques permanentes et de graves problèmes de santé mentale et émotionnelle. Son frère s'est enfui du Mexique pour les États-Unis. Le demandeur a sollicité l'aide de la police, mais les policiers semblaient être des alliés de la famille Cepeda. Le demandeur et son épouse se sont enfuis à Ario de Rosales, mais la famille Cepeda les a retrouvés. Ensuite, ils se sont enfuis à Tijuana, où ils ont été agressés par des malfaiteurs. Ensuite, ils se sont enfuis à la ville de Mexico, où ils ont séjourné pendant cinq jours avant de quitter le pays.
[4]
Le demandeur est arrivé au Canada le 6 mai 2007. Il a présenté une demande d'asile le 14 mai 2007, mais le désistement de sa demande a été ultimement prononcé, parce qu'il n'a pas assisté aux audiences en raison d'un épisode sévère de paranoïa dépressive nécessitant son hospitalisation. Il craint de retourner au Mexique en raison de la violence de la famille Cepeda, une menace aggravée par ses problèmes de santé physique et mentale, lesquels ont entraîné son incapacité d'avoir accès aux services sociaux.
[5]
Le 17 mai 2011, il a présenté une demande d'ERAR.
La décision de l'agent chargé de l'ERAR
[6]
L'agent a informé le demandeur du rejet de sa demande au moyen d'une lettre datée du 10 février 2012.
[7]
Les motifs commencent par un résumé des risques cernés par le demandeur et l'historique de son statut de l'immigration. L'agent a relevé la preuve documentaire fournie par le demandeur, notamment les rapports médicaux et l'exposé circonstancié du demandeur contenu dans le Formulaire de renseignements personnels (le FRP) de sa demande d'asile.
[8]
L'agent s'est ensuite penché sur l'appréciation des risques avancés par le demandeur. L'agent a décrit comment le demandeur craignait des représailles de la famille Cepeda, en raison du défaut de paiement de l'argent pour sa protection. L'agent a conclu que le demandeur n'avait établi ni que ce conflit continuait d'exister ni que la persécution alléguée avait un lien avec l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention selon l'article 96 de la Loi, étant donné que les victimes de crime ne constituent pas un groupe social.
[9]
Par conséquent, l'agent a examiné la demande du demandeur eu égard à l'article 97 de la Loi; il a noté que les risques causés par l'incapacité du Mexique à fournir au demandeur des soins médicaux ou des soins de santé adéquats ne peuvent pas être pris en considération selon les termes du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(iv). L'agent a décrit comment le demandeur craignait d'être battu, violé et tué par la famille Cepeda et son allégation selon laquelle il n'avait pas de possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) au Mexique, parce que ses persécuteurs étaient en mesure de le trouver quel que soit l'endroit où il était dans ce pays. L'agent a conclu que les problèmes du demandeur étaient de nature locale et qu'il n'avait pas établi que ses persécuteurs continueraient de s'intéresser à lui, étant donné que les infractions criminelles en question avaient été commises en janvier 2007.
[10]
Ensuite, l'agent a examiné la fuite du demandeur à Ario de Rosales. Le demandeur n'a pas expliqué pourquoi il avait choisi de s'enfuir vers une région où il savait que la famille Cepeda vivait, ni pourquoi la rencontre avec la famille Cepeda était due au fait que cette famille le poursuivait, et non au fait d'une rencontre fortuite. Le demandeur n'a pas fourni de renseignements sur la confrontation, notamment sur la question de savoir si des plaintes avaient été déposées à la police.
[11]
L'agent a examiné l'autre fuite du demandeur à Tijuana. Il a relevé que le demandeur n'a pas prétendu que l'agression commise par les malfaiteurs dans cette ville était liée aux autres agressions commises par la famille Cepeda et que le demandeur n'avait pas signalé d'autres problèmes pendant qu'il vivait à Tijuana. Le demandeur n'a pas expliqué pourquoi cet acte criminel l'avait amené à prendre la décision de s'enfuir à la ville de Mexico.
[12]
L'agent a décrit les éléments de preuve fournis par le demandeur relativement à son épouse qui, à l'origine, est venue avec lui au Canada, mais qui est depuis retournée au Mexique. Le demandeur a soutenu qu'à son retour au Mexique, son épouse a été menacée par quelqu'un qui lui a demandé où le demandeur se trouvait. L'agent a conclu que les renseignements relatifs à ce fait, tels que la date, le lieu et l'identité du malfaiteur, faisaient défaut. L'agent a aussi conclu que les éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur relativement aux membres de sa famille victimes de crimes étaient le résultat d'une criminalité généralisée et n'avaient pas de lien avec la famille Cepeda. Le demandeur n'avait ni fourni de preuve du statut de son frère aux États-Unis ni établi si son frère avait demandé l'asile. L'agent a conclu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que les motifs des mauvais traitements du demandeur dans le passé n'existaient plus. L'agent a aussi jugé que la preuve était insuffisante pour conclure qu'il y avait des policiers parmi les malfaiteurs qui avaient agressé le demandeur en 2007.
[13]
L'agent a admis l'existence des problèmes de santé dont souffrait le demandeur, mais il a conclu que ceux-ci n'affecteraient pas la possibilité pour le demandeur d'avoir accès aux services sociaux au Mexique. L'agent a noté que le demandeur avait précédemment reçu des traitements médicaux au Mexique après l'agression de 2007, et qu'il bénéficiait du soutien de sa famille dans ce pays. Par conséquent, l'agent a rejeté l'argument du demandeur selon lequel il ne disposait pas d'une PRI.
[14]
Enfin, l'agent a relevé les documents sur la situation du pays portant sur la criminalité et la corruption au Mexique, mais il a conclu que ces documents ne fournissaient aucune preuve de la situation personnelle du demandeur ni des risques auxquels le demandeur serait exposé s'il y retournait.
Questions en litige
[15]
Le demandeur a soulevé la question en litige suivante:
1. La décision est-elle raisonnable?
[16]
Je reformulerais les questions en litige de la façon suivante:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
2. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur lorsqu'il a rejeté la demande?
Observations écrites du demandeur
[17]
Le demandeur soutient que la norme de contrôle applicable est la décision raisonnable.
[18]
Selon le demandeur, la première erreur commise par l'agent est qu'il a mal qualifié le caractère pertinent des problèmes de santé du demandeur. Selon le demandeur, ses problèmes de santé physique et mentale avaient contribué à son incapacité à avoir accès à quelque protection de l'État que ce soit qui lui était offerte. L'agent a apprécié les problèmes de santé comme source de risque en cas de retour au Mexique, au lieu de les apprécier comme un état nuisant à la capacité du demandeur de pallier le risque par la protection de l'État ou une PRI.
[19]
La deuxième erreur est la mauvaise interprétation que l'agent a faite des éléments de preuve relatifs à l'intérêt de la famille Cepeda envers le demandeur. L'agent s'est concentré sur l'incident de 2007, et il n'a pas tenu compte de la preuve fournie par le demandeur relativement au très important conflit familial, notamment le meurtre de son oncle parce qu'il avait refusé de vendre des médicaments sous ordonnance aux membres de la famille Cepeda. La conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle la famille Cepeda ne menaçait plus le demandeur était fondée sur une appréciation sélective des éléments de preuve.
[20]
Troisièmement, l'agent aurait dû prendre en compte la question de savoir s'il y avait des raisons impérieuses soulevées par la persécution antérieure du demandeur pour que ce dernier ne retourne pas au Mexique. Une telle enquête s'applique à la demande présentée au titre des articles 96 ou 97, et elle ne repose pas sur un lien. L'agent a l'obligation de tenir compte de l'exception fondée sur des raisons impérieuses, même si elle n'a pas été soulevée par le demandeur. Les problèmes de santé mentale du demandeur auraient dû être pris en compte comme étant des raisons impérieuses.
[21]
Quatrièmement, l'agent a conclu de façon erronée que le demandeur était exposé à un risque généralisé, vu la preuve selon laquelle il avait été pris pour cible personnellement, et ce de façon répétée. Le fait qu'un risque est soulevé en raison d'activités criminelles n'est pas à lui seul un motif d'exclusion de la possibilité de protection en application de l'article 97.
[22]
Cinquièmement, l'agent a conclu de façon erronée que le demandeur disposait d'une PRI parce que la preuve considérable relative aux soins de santé qui a été déposée établissait que l'état mental du demandeur l'aurait empêché d'obtenir une PRI au Mexique ou d'avoir accès au soutien nécessaire. L'agent a aussi omis de tenir compte de l'observation du demandeur selon laquelle les services médicaux et sociaux au Mexique lui auraient été offerts seulement s'il travaillait, ce qui n'était pas possible, étant donné sa santé mentale et médicale. L'agent n'a décrit ni l'existence d'une PRI locale ni l'existence de mécanismes de protection de l'État offerts dans une telle PRI.
[23]
Sixièmement, le demandeur n'a pas demandé l'asile parce qu'il n'aurait pas obtenu les soins de santé adéquats au Mexique. Le demandeur n'a jamais déclaré que les risques étaient causés par le manque de soins de santé. Au contraire, son état de santé le rend incapable d'avoir accès aux soins dont il a besoin, et il n'est pas en mesure d'avoir accès à la protection de l'État.
[24]
Enfin, l'agent a omis d'examiner la question de la protection de l'État, et il n'a tiré aucune conclusion à cet égard.
Observations écrites du défendeur
[25]
Le défendeur soutient que le demandeur n'a pas de lien avec l'un des motifs de la Convention parce qu'il est une victime de crime. Les problèmes prétendus du demandeur avec ses persécuteurs ont commencé seulement après qu'il eut refusé de payer de l'argent pour sa protection. Le dossier de demande ne révèle aucune preuve corroborante des allégations du demandeur sur l'existence d'un conflit familial de longue date.
[26]
Le défendeur soutient qu'une persécution passée est un facteur pertinent, mais non déterminant d'une crainte axée sur l'avenir. Le demandeur n'a pas fourni de preuve adéquate établissant qu'il serait toujours exposé à un risque s'il retournait au Mexique. L'agent a conclu que les faits étaient de nature locale, et que les incidents relatifs à l'extorsion révélaient l'existence d'un risque de criminalité généralisée.
[27]
L'agent a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas expliqué de façon satisfaisante la raison pour laquelle il avait choisi de s'enfuir vers une région où il savait que la famille Cepeda vivait et qu'il n'avait pas établi que l'incident d'Ario de Rosales ne résultait pas d'une rencontre fortuite. Il n'y avait pas de preuve que la police avait été contactée. L'agent a conclu que les agressions criminelles à Tijuana n'étaient pas liées à la famille Cepeda. Le demandeur n'a fourni aucune preuve objective établissant que les membres de sa famille avaient été pris pour cibles par la famille Cepeda, de sorte qu'il était raisonnable de conclure qu'ils étaient victimes d'un risque généralisé.
[28]
Le défendeur fait valoir que le demandeur n'a pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État. Le fardeau qui pesait sur le demandeur était très lourd, étant donné que le Mexique a un statut de société démocratique. En l'espèce, la seule fois où le demandeur dit avoir sollicité l'aide de la police, cette dernière n'a pas été en mesure de mener une enquête complète, parce que le demandeur n'a pu identifier que l'un de ses assaillants. Le demandeur a déclaré qu'un médecin légiste l'avait examiné et avait pris des notes, mais il n'a fourni aucun rapport médico-légal ni rapport de police. L'agent a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas établi que la police était intervenue relativement à l'agression de 2007. Il n'y avait pas d'indication que le demandeur avait entrepris d'autres démarches pour solliciter la protection de l'État, y compris à Ario de Rosales, à Tijuana ou à la ville de Mexico. L'omission de solliciter la protection de l'État dans une démocratie comme le Mexique sera généralement fatale à la demande d'asile. Dans beaucoup de décisions récentes relatives à la question de la protection de l'État au Mexique, il a été décidé qu'il n'était pas suffisant qu'un demandeur se fonde uniquement sur la preuve documentaire, s'il a omis de se prévaloir de la protection de l'État.
[29]
L'agent a manifestement saisi que l'état de santé du demandeur était un facteur secondaire et qu'il ne faisait pas partie du risque allégué. L'agent a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur était capable d'avoir accès aux services médicaux et sociaux au Mexique. L'agent a correctement exclu la prise en compte des soins médicaux, comme l'exige l'article 97.
Observations du demandeur en réplique
[30]
Le demandeur allègue que le défendeur tente de défendre la décision de l'agent avec des motifs autres que ceux contenus dans la décision rendue. Le défendeur avance que le dossier ne révèle pas de preuve objective du conflit familial, mais l'agent n'a pas conclu que ce récit n'était pas vrai et il n'a pas demandé une telle preuve. Un témoignage assermenté doit être cru à moins qu'il n'y ait une bonne raison de ne pas le croire.
[31]
Le demandeur allègue que le mémoire du défendeur contient beaucoup d'autres arguments avancés par ce dernier et basés sur le dossier qui ne ressortent pas de la décision de l'agent. L'agent n'a mené aucune analyse relative à la protection de l'État.
[32]
Le demandeur allègue que la conclusion centrale de l'agent était que le mauvais traitement du demandeur était un fait qui avait eu lieu une seule fois, ce qui a contribué à la conclusion tirée relativement au risque généralisé. Bien qu'un conflit sanguin entre des familles ne puisse pas donner lieu à l'existence d'un lien, ce n'était certainement pas un fait isolé.
Analyse et décision
Première question
Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
[33]
Lorsque la jurisprudence a établi la norme de contrôle applicable à une question donnée, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 57).
[34]
Il est constant en droit que la norme de contrôle applicable à une décision faisant suite à une demande d'ERAR est en général la décision raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 980, au paragraphe 11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 52, au paragraphe 11). De la même façon, les questions relatives à la protection de l'État ainsi qu'à la pondération, à l'interprétation et à l'appréciation de la preuve sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 924, au paragraphe 5;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 1286, au paragraphe 38).
[35]
Lorsqu'elle effectue le contrôle de la décision de l'agent selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour ne devrait pas intervenir, à moins que l'agent n'ait tiré une conclusion qui n'est pas transparente, justifiée et intelligible et qui n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables eu égard à la preuve dont il disposait (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 59). Comme la Cour suprême l'a décidé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la cour de révision ne peut substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable ni soupeser à nouveau la preuve (au paragraphe 59).
Deuxième question
L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur lorsqu'il a rejeté la demande?
[36]
L'agent est présumé avoir examiné toutes les preuves dont il était saisi (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 411), au paragraphe 33). Toutefois, plus la preuve qui n'a pas été mentionnée est importante et plus une cour de justice sera disposée à inférer de ce silence que l'agent a tiré une conclusion de faits erronée sans tenir compte des éléments de preuve dont il disposait (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 189, au paragraphe 35).
[37]
En l'espèce, le risque principal allégué par le demandeur était un conflit familial de longue date. L'agent n'a pas tiré de conclusion selon laquelle le conflit n'existait pas ou que la preuve du demandeur manquait de crédibilité. Au contraire, l'agent a relevé que le demandeur n'avait ni établi que le conflit continuait toujours, ni qu'il en avait été victime avant l'incident qui avait précipité sa fuite du Mexique.
[38]
Malgré qu'il ait implicitement accepté l'existence du conflit, du moins dans le passé, l'agent a fait une analyse des risques qui s'est uniquement concentrée sur l'incident individuel relatif à l'omission [du demandeur] de payer l'argent de la protection. L'agent relève que [traduction] « les problèmes du demandeur au Mexique étaient de nature locale [...] [l] es infractions criminelles commises en janvier 2007 sont maintenant choses du passé », et il fait preuve de scepticisme en ce qui a trait au fait que les malfaiteurs qui ont kidnappé le demandeur s'intéresseraient toujours à lui au motif qu'il n'a pas payé l'argent de la protection. L'analyse de l'agent relative à la question de savoir si les persécuteurs du demandeur le suivraient ailleurs au Mexique ne fait aucune mention du conflit familial; ainsi, elle repose sans doute uniquement sur l'incident relatif à l'argent de la protection.
[39]
Lorsqu'il a pris en compte la preuve du demandeur relative aux membres de sa famille, l'agent a conclu qu'ils étaient des victimes de crimes au Mexique en général, vu que le demandeur n'a pas fourni de précisions, par exemple si les persécuteurs étaient des membres de la famille Cepeda. Cela ne prend pas en compte l'exposé circonstancié du demandeur dans son FRP, dans lequel il déclare clairement que le meurtre de son père et les coups reçus par son frère ont été perpétrés par cette famille.
[40]
Le rôle de la Cour n'est pas de soupeser à nouveau la preuve. Toutefois, le rôle de l'agent est de prendre en compte, de façon appropriée, les éléments de preuve fournis par le demandeur. En l'espèce, la preuve du demandeur établissait que le risque auquel il était exposé trouvait son origine dans un violent conflit familial. L'agent n'a pas pris en compte cette preuve lorsqu'il a apprécié la possibilité que le demandeur puisse être exposé à des risques s'il retournait au Mexique.
[41]
Cela met la décision de l'agent en conflit avec les valeurs de transparence et de justification de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité. Pour ce motif, je suis d'avis d'accueillir la demande et de renvoyer l'affaire à un autre agent pour qu'il statue à nouveau sur la demande.
[42]
Aucune des parties n'a souhaité proposer de question sérieuse de portée générale pour que je la certifie.
JUGEMENT
[43]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie et que l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent pour qu'il statue à nouveau sur celle-ci.
