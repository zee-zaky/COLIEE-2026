Reasons For Judgment
[1]
Dubé, J.
[Original]: This action in patent infringement was commenced on May 15, 1989, and was finally heard in Montréal, Québec, from September 5 to September 15, 1995. The first plaintiff ("Risi Stone") is an Ontario company with head office at Gormley, Ontario. The second plaintiff ("UPL") is a Québec company with head office at St-Luc, Québec. The defendant ("Permacon") is a Québec company with head office at Ville d'Anjou, Québec. All three companies are engaged in the manufacturing and selling of precast concrete building blocks for use in constructing retaining walls.
1- The Action In Patent Infringement
[2]
Risi Stone is the owner by assignment of the invention disclosed and claimed in Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,182,295 ("patent 295") entitled "Retaining Wall System", issued on February 12, 1985, to Angelo Risi and Antonio Risi. Risi Stone claims that since August 11, 1980, it has been engaged in the manufacture and sale in Ontario of retaining wall systems derived from precast concrete blocks embodying the invention covered by patent 295 under and in association with its trademark "Pisa Stone" which, upon introduction into the Canadian market place, met with immediate acceptance by municipalities, architectural and landscaping firms in Ontario. In addition, commencing at least as early as October 1982, Risi Stone arranged for the preparation and first publication in Canada of trade circulars illustrating and describing its Pisa Stone product. As a result, a very substantial reputation and goodwill in relation to such business has accrued to Risi Stone which has enjoyed considerable commercial success.
[3]
By instrument in writing dated November 1, 1985, Risi Stone granted to UPL an exclusive nontransferable licence for patent 295 to manufacture and sell throughout a territory defined as the province of Québec and the Ottawa Valley of the province of Ontario. Thereafter, UPL has been engaged in the manufacture, distribution, advertising and sale of the retaining wall systems derived from such blocks in that territory.
[4]
The plaintiffs claim that Permacon, without the consent or authority of Risi Stone, at least as early as March 1989, began to reproduce or have reproduced and sell in Ontario and Québec precast concrete interlocking blocks for the construction of retaining walls having the characteristics of the interlocking blocks and retaining wall systems of Risi Stone. Permacon, at least as early as March 1989, published a trade circular wherein said blocks and retaining wall systems have been both illustrated and described with the trade names "Minitalus", "Group Permacon Inc.", and "Permacon - Montco": thus Permacon has infringed Risi Stone's patent 295, and more particularly claims 1, 3, 8 and 9 of the patent.
[5]
The plaintiffs therefore launched this action under the
Copyright Act
[see footnote 1], the
Trade-marks Act
[see footnote 2] and the
Patent Act
[see footnote 3].
2- The Application For Interlocutory
Injunction
[6]
The plaintiffs sought an interlocutory injunction to prevent Permacon from manufacturing and selling its "Minitalus" precast concrete interlocking blocks. Their application was heard by my colleague Madam Justice Reed in the course of a full-fledged three day hearing in December 1989. She denied the application and outlined her reasons for doing so in a very comprehensive sixteen page judgment.
[7]
She properly noted that it is not the function of a judge on an interlocutory injunction application to determine the merits of the case in any final way and what was required from her was an assessment of the strength of the plaintiffs' case by way of a summary review of the evidence placed before her. She did make an assessment of the strength of the plaintiffs' case with respect to both the patent infringement claim and the claim under s. 7(b) of the
Trade-marks Act
.
[8]
Under the heading "Ambiguity", she found that there seemed "little doubt that claim 1 does not distinctly set out in explicit terms the invention which is claimed as new" and that all the other claims were dependent on claim 1. She also found that "there is a very good argument that claim 1 of both patents is broader than the invention made". (On December 5, 1994, the plaintiffs dropped their action based on Patent No. 1,204,296 ("patent 296"), a sister patent to the instant patent 295).
[9]
As to the infringement proper, she noted that even if the patent was valid "it is clear there is no textual infringement" and, moreover, that "a comparison of the defendant's block with the text of the claims in issue makes it clear that it will be very difficult for the plaintiffs to demonstrate a substantial taking of the invention". With reference to the action under the
Trade-marks Act
, she held that "in the present case, there is simply no convincing evidence that any confusion in the mind of the public would arise such as to make people think that the defendant's product is the plaintiffs' product".
3- The Field Of Invention
[10]
As mentioned in the first paragraph of the patent, the invention relates to improvements in retaining wall systems and cribbing and particularly to improved interlocking precast concrete stretchers and headers. It is important to note at this early stage that a crib is generally in the form of a box or a cage with four sides or walls, whereas a retaining wall is a single wall and that "stretchers" are individual interlocking building blocks, whereas "headers" are blocks placed at right angles to the stretchers to consolidate the wall and are used mainly for larger industrial cribbing structures. Thus, the field of invention includes single, conventional retaining walls as well as larger cribbing structures.
4- Background To The Invention
[11]
Before the advent of precast concrete blocks, retaining walls were constructed from concrete mix poured into requisite forms mounted on footings. The operation was time-consuming and costly as it required skilled labour and heavy commercial equipment.
[12]
It is common practice (at the time of the invention) to construct a retaining wall from precast concrete slabs mounted upon suitably prepared footings and anchored together with mortar, which structure is also expensive and time-consuming.
[13]
Interlocking precast concrete blocks have been produced and used without mortar to build a retaining wall or a crib, which does not require skilled labour on the site but only at the plant and is less expensive.
5- Objects Of The Invention
[14]
Patent 295 outlines five objects of the invention which may be reduced as follows:
"1. To provide concrete stretchers or 'log-like' blocks which interlock with each other giving rise to the creation of a stable retaining wall or cribbing structure automatically inclined to the vertical at a predetermined requisite angle.
"2. To provide interlocking precast concrete stretchers or headers which can be assembled together to form crib structures at a predetermined requisite inclination with the supporting and anchoring headers and stretchers buried under suitable backfill.
"3. To provide such blocks as would offer attractive architectural alternatives (for example, stairways).
"4. To provide such interlocking blocks which would pose no special hazard so far as the exposed facings are concerned to merit recommendation for public structures.
"5. A very important object is to provide a retaining wall system or cribbing structure that would be competitive with other proposals available in the marketplace."
6- Features Of The Invention
[15]
One principal feature resides in providing a stretcher (or "log-like" member) mounted in interlocking relation upon a lower stretcher so that the superior stretcher is disposed slightly inwardly from the facings of the inferior stretcher and towards the embankment to provide a predetermined inclination. Thus, the stretcher is provided with a projection (or plurality of projections) extending upwardly from the upper surface thereof and includes a matching recess formation opening to the lower surface thereof spaced from the exposed facing of the stretcher at a selected distance greater than its matching recess formation. In other words, the spacing between the projection and the recess from the vertical provides the desired inclination.
[16]
The matching recess is in the form of an open ended longitudinally extending channel of substantially uniform configuration throughout its extent allowing the matching stretcher to slide therein and so allow for the staggering of the stretchers. However, whereas the matching recess formation may extend from end to end, the projection or projections may be confined or limited to only a portion of the longitudinal extent which may allow for a corner to be readily incorporated into the structure.
[17]
Another feature of the invention resides in providing a precast or reinforced tie back or concrete header to securely tie the exposed retaining outer wall to the embankment, with the exposed facing of such header having a configuration matching the facings of the stretchers.
[18]
It is noted under the preferred embodiments of the invention that a number of alternative retaining wall systems or crib structures can be derived from the several modules or components illustrated and described. Where the height is low the tie backs or headers need not be anchored within the embankment upon interior wall formations but can be placed to extend rearwardly from the exposed front stretchers directly into the compacted backfill.
7- The Relevant Claims
[19]
Claims 1, 3, 8 and 9 of the patent are reproduced in toto:
"1. In an interlocking block for a retaining wall structure wherein like blocks are laid in horizontal courses one upon the other in end to end relation with the upper blocks interlocking with the lower blocks and displaceable therealong in sliding fit and therebeyond to overlap the adjacent ends of the lower blocks and to extend upwardly as such wall structure is erected at a selected uniform inclination to the vertical said block having an axis terminating in spaced apart end walls and bounded by generally flat top and bottom walls arranged in parallel relation to said axis and to each other and by front and rear facings extending from end wall to end wall and so separated as to provide a substantially uniform cross-section throughout the axial extent of same, projecting means upstanding from said top wall and extending axially of said block between said end walls and spaced inwardly from said front facing to present an uninterrupted flat top wall portion therebetween said bottom wall having recess means therein likewise spaced inwardly from said front facing and extending axially of said block between said end walls said projecting means and said recess means having a configuration and extent so as to matingly interlock in sliding fit when such blocks are disposed in horizontal courses one upon the other and in overlapping relation to present said projecting means upwardly, said projecting means being spaced rearwardly in relation to said axis a selected extent exceeding that of said recess means whereby each overlying horizontal course is automatically uniformly set back from the next below horizontal course so as to define a uniformly inclined wall structure at a selected angle to the vertical.
"3. A block according to claims 1 or 2 wherein said recess means and projecting means have a generally trapezoidal configuration in cross-section.
"8. A block according to claims 1, 2 or 5 wherein said projecting means comprises a plurality of spaced-apart like projections.
"9. A block according to claims 1, 2 or 5 wherein said front facing includes a first region lowermost and a second region uppermost, said second region being inclined to said first region and extending upwardly and rearwardly thereof."
[20]
Thus, claim 1 is one long phrase containing 281 words separated by two commas. Under s. 36(2) of the
Patent Act
, then in force, a claim must state "distinctly and in explicit terms the things or combinations that the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property privilege". Obviously, at first reading, claim 1 does not appear to be a model of concision and limpidity. It is not a literary masterpiece. Very few patent claims are. They are not meant to be read and enjoyed by avid novel readers and even less so by sophisticated authors. Claims are drafted to be understood by people with practical knowledge and experience in the specific field of the invention. As Lord Diplock said in the well-known <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case [see footnote 4]:
"... A patent specification should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it a kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by the training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience with the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand ..."
[21]
The plaintiffs' expert, Michael B. Bernardi, a senior geotechnical engineer, understood claim 1 and described it as follows in paragraphs 44 and 45 of his affidavit:
"44. I wish now to discuss how the combination of the features of the i) offset effect, ii) the sliding fit, and, iii) the use of projections and matching recesses, are actually achieved since these are to me, essential to this patent; as such, I will discuss how the invention, as claimed in claims 1, 3, 8 and 9, actually works, and I shall commence with claim 1;
"45. Claim 1 contains more than one essential element of the patent. In effect, the claim describes interlocking building blocks for retaining wall structures which when fitted one upon the other horizontally, obtain an offset effect. Secondly, it is clear from the claim that the offset effect and the overall strength of the resulting structure which uses such interlocking blocks is achieved as a result of the use of recess means and projecting means. Thirdly, the recess means, as mentioned earlier, is an open ended longitudinally extending channel and as such, when the projecting means and recess means mate, they interlock in a sliding fit. The fact that the interlocking blocks are displaceable along the inferior block in sliding fit is essential to this claim basically for the following reasons:
i) the structure, which is made up of the said blocks, is considered to be flexible, able to withstand considerable differential settlement, without jeopardizing the stability of the wall. Without this ability to slide with respect to each other, the blocks would not be able to tolerate any movement, thus resulting in either a skewed-looking retaining wall or damaged interlocking mechanisms, which may lead to instability in the structure.
ii) the block, which is mass-produced by means of form work, may have imperfections such as burrs upon completion. The sliding fit helps to eliminate these imperfections and results in a constant and level block-to-block interface.
iii) the block is easier to handle."
[22]
In his oral evidence Mr. Bernardi stated that there are three central elements to patent 295. First, interlocking building blocks which produce an offset effect (the inclination). Secondly, the offset is produced by the result of recess means and projecting means spaced properly. Thirdly, the sliding fit produced by the open ended recess means.
[23]
[Translation] Like his colleague Bernardi, the defendant's expert, Guy Lefebvre, a doctor in civil engineering (geotechnics), recognized that three elements are claimed as the invention in claim 1. He described them as follows in paragraph 49 of his affidavit:
[Translation]
"(1) a system of blocks anchored one on top of another with a sliding fit along the length of the blocks, permitting the construction of an inclined structure by means of blocks laid horizontally.
"(2) a block with a uniform section and flat top and bottom walls that is capable of interlocking upon another block through a system of continuous projecting means and recess means along the entire length of the block.
"(3) an automatic offset of the blocks when placed one on top of another because of the spacing between the projecting means and the recess means, making it possible to build a structure having a certain inclination."
[24]
Of course, the two experts did not agree on all the other points, as we will see below.

9- Infringement
[30]
Permacon admits that it has produced and still does produce blocks known under the name of "Minitalus" as well as several other blocks, but denies that its products violate a substantial element of patent 295. Several blocks from both parties were filed as exhibits and in display in the courtroom for discussions throughout the trial. Of course, the relevant comparison does not lie between the blocks of the parties but the proper question to be resolved is whether or not defendant's blocks violate any of the claims of plaintiffs' patent 295.
[31]
According to Mr. Bernardi, the "Minitalus" is a block which allows the user to erect a retaining wall with the offset effect through the use of projecting means and recess means. Furthermore, the projecting means and recess means are arranged so as to mate in an interlocking sliding fit. The defendant's position, as pleaded in its statement of defence, is that there is no sliding fit feature in its block since the sliding fit of the "Minitalus" is normally limited to approximately 2.5 centimetres. However, according to Mr. Bernardi, it is clear that the "Minitalus" is not intended to be simply based on a "peg and socket" method of interlock. There are "Minitalus" blocks which do contain recess means that open to one end of the block. Mr. Bernardi's position is well-defined in paragraphs 56, 57 and 58 of his affidavit:
"56. As mentioned previously, claim 1 of 295 patent calls for the bottom wall of the block to have 'recess means therein likewise spaced inwardly from said front facing and extending axially of said blocks between said end walls'. This quoted passage does
not
specify that the recess means 'is continuous
and
opens to each of the end walls of the blocks'. As mentioned above, this interpretation is confirmed by claim 4 of the patent, which, like any subclaim, is supposed to add an additional feature to the main claim and recites that: 'said recess means opens to each of said end walls thereof'. In my opinion, the fact of this feature being recited in a subclaim makes it clear that it was in the inventor's mind that the 'recess means', that is, the groove in the bottom of the block, could have one or two closed ends.
"57. I do not believe that claim 1 means that every upper block can necessarily slide over the full length or row of lower blocks. In fact, there is no need for the block to slide all the way, and in some cases this would even defeat the purpose of the invention. On this question the claim merely means that the upper block is provided with the
possibility
of sliding to a given extent, even minimally, with respect to a lower block on which it is mounted, to come into contact with another lateral block and ensure, for example, that the adjacent blocks may be joined.
"58. This sliding fit feature can definitely be found in the Minitalus block. It is clear from a simple visual review of the block that the pegs projecting on top of the Minitalus blocks can slide to a certain extent, even in the close ended grooves made in the lower blocks."
[32]
[Translation] However, the defendant's expert witness, Guy Lefebvre, saw the situation in an entirely different light. According to him, the "Minitalus" block is delivered to the building site in slabs that are 3" thick, 32" long and 24" wide. As shown in figure 1 reproduced below, grooves Y and Z create lines of weakness in the slab, allowing it to be broken easily into three "Minitalus" blocks. Each of the three blocks obtained in this way has a broken or burst facing that resembles natural stone.
[see printed version]
[33]
According to this expert witness the "Minitalus" blocks fit into one another through a system of male and female elements. The male elements are made up of four circular disk-shaped projections arranged in a single row along the 32-inch length. The female element is made up of a single recess means that stops two inches from the ends of the blocks. The recess means therefore cannot be seen on the visible walls at the ends of the blocks. These blocks are not meant to be used in building retaining walls with headers interlocking in the wall (such as the headers covered by patent 295). They are used solely to build low retaining walls by stacking the blocks one on top of another. These low retaining walls are rarely built on a perfectly vertical line but rather incline slightly inwards, that is, toward the earth being supported. These low walls do not require headers, unlike retaining walls made up of stretchers and headers forming a cage that is usually called a crib, as provided for in patent 295.
[34]
According to Mr. Lefebvre all the elements of the description of the invention in patent 295 relate to a retaining system made up of stretchers and headers, not a low retaining wall made up of blocks that are simply placed one on top of another. The prior art cited in this patent, namely seven patents issued between 1930 and 1981, refers only to retaining structures made up of stretchers and headers. The objects of the invention listed in the description of patent 295 relate both to an improved concrete stretcher or log-like block producing an automatic offset and an inclined structure and to an assembly of stretchers and headers forming various retaining structures. According to him, the fact that the invention relates to an assembly of concrete stretchers and headers is clearly illustrated by all of the sketches included with the patent.
[35]
It seemed obvious to this expert witness that the "Minitalus" block is not meant to be used in a retaining system involving headers or in a crib-type assembly. He noted that the term "retaining wall", which is normally used to designate a simple wall to retain earth, is never used as such in the claims of patent 295, but is always qualified by the term "structure" or "system", just like in the description of the invention. In the patent claims, the terms "retaining wall structure" and "retaining wall system" are used to designate an assembly of stretchers and headers, not a simple wall.
[36]
According to this expert witness the female interlocking element covered by patent 295 is trapezoidal in section, extends across the entire length and is visible at the ends of the stretchers, as shown in figure 3 of the patent. In the "Minitalus" block, the female element is also made up of a recess means that is trapezoidal in section, but it does not extend to the end of the block, with the result that the ends of the block are complete in section and have no apparent recess means, as illustrated in figures 15(b) and 16 of Mr. Lefebvre's affidavit.
[see printed version]
[37]
Mr. Lefebvre further explained that the male interlocking element of the "Minitalus" is clearly different from that covered by patent 295. The latter is made up of a projecting means along the length of the stretcher that may be discontinued and not extend to the end. This projecting means is trapezoidal in shape, that is, its section is defined by four straight-line segments, two of which are parallel. Moreover, when seen in plane this projecting means or these projecting means segments always have four edges made up of right angles and the section of the projecting means is uniform all along its length. In contrast, in the "Minitalus" block the male elements are made up of projections that are not trapezoidal in section. Two of the sides that define the section of these projections are curved. As well, the section of these projections varies at all points and, when seen in plane, these projections have no edges and are circular in shape.
[38]
According to Mr. Lefebvre it is impossible to interlock two side blocks or stretchers to form a 90
o
angle, as illustrated in figure 3 of patent 295. The completely open recess means at the end of the block cannot fit into any male element of a lower block placed perpendicular to the first. In contrast, the "Minitalus" block, because its recess means is closed at one end of the block, is designed to fit into a lower block placed perpendicular thereto, as shown in figure 16. The corners are therefore made up of two perpendicular facings that fit into one another.
[39]
First of all, I do not agree with the expert witness Lefebvre that the invention described in patent 295 is limited to a retaining system made up of stretchers and headers. As mentioned in the first paragraph of the patent, the invention relates to improvements in retaining walls and cribbing. The stretchers relate to the retaining wall and the headers are part of the cribbing. The objects of the invention clearly establish that it primarily concerns stretchers or log-like blocks for the creation of a stable retaining wall or cribbing structure.
[40]
The claims of patent 295 relate to a block and not a wall. The first ten claims refer directly to a block. The first claim begins with the words "In an interlocking block ..." The following eight claims begin with the words "A block according to ... ." The tenth claims begins with the words "In a block ..." The other claims refer to a "retaining wall system". Furthermore, as mentioned above, the first five figures reproduce a wall made up of blocks in a crib while the other seven figures illustrate blocks alone. The heart of the invention is therefore a block, and since this is a combination invention the block has three distinctive essential elements: the interlocking of the projecting means and the recess means, the sliding fit via the recess means and the resulting automatic offset that creates an inclination from the vertical.
[41]
The natural stone effect produced by breaking the block is therefore irrelevant to the case at bar. The size of the blocks produced by the defendant is also irrelevant. A small block in a low retaining wall may violate patent 295 as much as a larger block in a larger wall. Although the defendant's "Minitalus" block cannot be used in a retaining system with headers or in a crib-type assembly, it does include the three essential elements protected by the patent and therefore constitutes an infringement.
[42]
To borrow the terminology used by Mr. Lefebvre in paragraph 49 of his affidavit with respect to the three elements claimed in the first claim of the patent, there is no doubt that the defendant's "Minitalus" block may be anchored with other similar blocks in an interlocking manner to build an inclined structure. It is true that some of the blocks produced by the defendant allow for very little sliding since the recess means is not much larger than the projecting means. However, the "Minitalus" in question has a continuous recess means across almost the entire length of the block, which allows for the requisite sliding. The "Minitalus" block has top and bottom walls that can interlock one on top of another via the projecting means and recess means. Finally, an automatic offset of the blocks occurs when they are placed one on top of another because of the spacing between the projecting means and the recess means; this makes it possible to build a structure with the desired inclination from the vertical.
[43]
The projecting means covered by patent 295 need not necessarily be continuous. Claim 8 specifically provides that the projecting means in question may comprise a plurality of spaced-apart projections and figure 8 illustrates such a projecting means made up of four small projections rather than a continuous projection.
[44]
The expert witness Lefebvre described the projecting means on the "Minitalus" as being composed of circular disk-shaped projections arranged in a single row. He noted that these blocks are not intended to be used in building a retaining wall with headers but, again, patent 295 protects types of blocks that may be interlocked in either type of wall. The mere fact that the disks are spaced apart and therefore do not constitute a continuous projecting means is of little importance. They are in a line and produce the same result as the discontinuous projecting means illustrated in figure 9 of patent 295.
[45]
It therefore remains to be determined whether the circular disk takes the concept of a discontinuous projecting means. It is true that claim 3 states that the projecting means and the recess means may be generally trapezoidal in shape, but claim 1 does not make such a qualification. Claim 1 provides only that the projecting means and the recess means must be configured so as to allow for mating of the two means. Some "Minitalus" blocks have a trapezoidal recess means and a projecting means made up of a line of disks. So as to justify the presence of claim 3, it must follow that claim 1 does not require the projecting means and the recess means to always be trapezoidal in shape.
[46]
The court therefore finds that Permacon's product takes the substance of patent 295, which constitutes an infringement.
10- Validity Of Patent 295
[47]
In its counterclaim the defendant Permacon alleged that patent 295 is invalid on the grounds of ambiguity, prior art, anticipation and obviousness to a person skilled in the art. In support of these allegations, counsel for Permacon submitted that to be valid an invention must have the following characteristics: (i) being useful; (ii) being new (not being anticipated); (iii) being inventive (not being obvious to a person skilled in the art at the time it was made); and (iv) the patent application must be complete and understandable.
10(a) - Ambiguity
[48]
I have already stated that, under s. 36(2) of the
Patent Act
[see footnote 5] then in force ("the
Act
"), the claims of a patent must state distinctly and in explicit terms the things or combinations in which the patent applicant claims an exclusive property or privilege. Under the preceding s. 36(1), the specifications must correctly and fully describe the invention in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains to make or use it. In the specifications, the patent applicant must particularly indicate and distinctly claim the part, improvement or combination which he or she claims as his or her invention. In the case at bar, it is a combination patent made of three essential elements, as mentioned earlier.
[49]
I have already noted that claim 1, although not elegantly worded, can be understood by any person skilled in the art of building walls and blocks. The two parties' experts argued at length about the meaning of certain words and expressions, but they both clearly understood the meaning of the claim and the three essential elements that it protects. No other witness skilled in the art testified that he or she could not make, construct, compound or use the object of the invention after reading patent 295. As for claims 3, 8 and 9, their clarity was not question.
[50]
I am strongly inclined to add that it is not easy for the defendant to show that a patent is ambiguous while also arguing that the invention is obvious [see footnote 6].
[51]
The wording of the specifications is clear and precise. Permacon, and more particularly the expert witness Lefebvre, argue that the specifications describe a crib-type retaining wall whereas Risi Stone is claiming the invention of a block for use in building a conventional retaining wall. In my view, as explained above, the specifications describe both types of retaining wall as well as the blocks to be used to build these walls, while the claims describe -- in understandable terms, at least to a person skilled in the art -- the blocks to be used to build these walls.
[52]
The defendant Permacon argued that the plaintiff Risi Stone had to make its election before addressing the issues of utility, anticipation and obviousness. It had a choice: it could argue either that the invention relates essentially to the system of stretchers and headers used in building a crib (thus the "Minitalus" blocks would not be covered by patent 295), or that the invention relates to the principle of automatic offset via spacing, an interlocking system involving projecting means and recess means (to cover the "Minitalus"). By relying on this second alternative it would throw the door wide open to the relevant prior art. According to the defendant it would be a classic case of the Gillette-type defence [see footnote 7]. Risi Stone chose the second alternative.
10(b) - Utility Of Patent 295
[53]
The utility of patent 295 was never seriously in question. This invention was implemented by both parties with a phenomenal success recognized by all the interested parties. In this regard, Permacon is asking the court to find that the invention protected by the patent cannot operate without headers; in other words, that a wall built of the blocks described in the patent would collapse if it did not contain both headers and stretchers. There is no evidence to this effect. On the contrary, the expert witness Bernardi testified that he himself put up a 13-foot high wall with Pisa Stone blocks without headers. It must also be added that if the defendant had considered patent 295 useless it would not have tried to obtain a licence from the inventor, Risi.
10(c) - Anticipation
[54]
Under s. 28(1)(c) of the
Act
the inventor of an invention cannot file a patent application if the invention was in public use or on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to the filing of the application. Section 28(1) reads as follows:
"28(1) Subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, any inventor or legal representative of an inventor of an invention that was
(a) not known or used by any other person before he invented it,
(b) not described in any patent or in any publication printed in Canada or in any other country more than two years before presentation of the petition hereunder mentioned, and
(c) not in public use or on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to his application in Canada,
may, on presentation to the Commissioner of a petition setting forth the facts (in this Act termed the filing of the application) and on compliance with all other requirements of this Act, obtain a patent granting to him an exclusive property in such invention."
[55]
Under s. 28(1)(c) any sale or public use in Canada for more than two years before the patent application was filed invalidates the patent because it is then considered to have been anticipated since the information contained in the patent is already in the public domain. The well-known author Harold Fox wrote the following on this subject in
Canadian Patent Law and Practice
[see footnote 8]:
"[Original] Where an article would show its method of manufacture by means of dissection or examination, the making and selling of such an article would amount to anticipation. This point is of some importance, involving the principle that it is sufficient publication if, on analysis, the composition of an article can be ascertained, and prior use is established by sale under these circumstances. It is not necessary that the composition or construction of a prior use should have been established by analysis or examination in order to show that there was public knowledge."
[56]
In paragraph 21 of its counterclaim Permacon argued the following in this regard:
[Translation]
"21(v) the so-called invention that is the subject of patent, 1,182,295 was in public use and offered for sale in Canada more than two years before the application that resulted in the patent was filed, in particular (a) by the offer to sell and the sale of blocks in July 1980 or earlier for a Beamish Construction project; (b) by the manufacturing and installation of moulds in 1979; and (c) by the offer to sell blocks similar to those described in Canadian patent 1,116,422;"
[57]
During the hearing Permacon tried to show, particularly by cross-examining the inventor and the inventor's expert witness, that they had publicly disclosed the essential elements of the invention in conversation with a Beamish Construction employee, by providing designs for the manufacturing of moulds or by selling blocks similar to those described in patent 295 more than two years before the patent application. These allegations were vigorously denied by the two witnesses and there is no reason to doubt their credibility. To prove anticipation, Permacon would have had to call a disinterested witness or at least to adduce more convincing evidence. Under s. 45 of the
Act
, a patent is presumed to be valid.
10(d) - Obviousness
[58]
The defendant alleged that the so-called invention is obvious to a person skilled in the art given the general knowledge available to the public, including patents and other documents.
[59]
In this regard the defendant argued that patent 295 does not disclose an invention but merely describes a workshop improvement. As Thorson, J., stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that the invention in question is not the result of an inventive idea but is merely "an obvious workshop improvement".
[60]
The first questions that arise in this respect are purely empirical. If the invention was so obvious, why had no one built a retaining wall containing blocks with the three essential elements before? Why did Permacon try to obtain a licence authorizing it to make Pisa Stone blocks? Why have Pisa Stone and "Minitalus" blocks and other derivatives been such a massive success (several hundred million dollars)?
[61]
To assess obviousness, it is necessary to consider all the patents that existed at the time, even those that were partially anticipatory, to determine the state of science and knowledge at the birth of the invention. According to jurisprudence, the question that must be asked with respect to obviousness is whether, on the date of the invention, an experienced but uninventive technician would, in light of the general knowledge at the time, have come without difficulty to the invention [see footnote 10].
[62]
It must be remembered that in a combination patent the novelty results from the idea of putting together different essential elements, even if these elements can be found separately elsewhere. The prior art, which will be discussed below, reveals that over the years several patents taught some of the essential elements of patent 295 but not all three in the same invention.
[63]
The expert Bernardi described in detail the type of retaining walls and blocks that existed before. However, none of them included the three essential elements of patent 295. He also reviewed the blocks on the Canadian markets at the time. He explained why the new blocks built pursuant to patent 295 have left the others behind and been so commercially successful. Even Permacon's expert witness, Mr. Lefebvre, did not testify that any experienced but unimaginative technician could have developed the invention of patent 295. What he argued was that other inventors (presumably having a certain imagination) obtained patents teaching the essential elements of patent 295; his invalidity argument thus relied on prior art and not obviousness.
[64]
It should be noted that the only two patents in which Mr. Lefebvre found the three elements of patent 295, namely the KUBO (US 3,488,964) and Warhendoff (US 4,193,718) patents, relate to a block used to build a wall without headers and not a cribbing, even though this expert asserted that patent 295 applies only to cribbing.
10(e) - Prior Art
[65]
According to the expert witness Lefebvre the concept of automatic offset incorporated into a system of interlocking blocks placed one on top of another in order to build an inclined wall is found in the prior art at least since 1943 (US Patent 2,323,363 issued March 9, 1943). As for the system of blocks that interlock one on top of another by means of trapezoid-shaped projecting means and recess means, whether single or multiple, it existed in the prior art well before 1980. He referred to the following patents:
(a) US 4,067,166;
(b) US 3,488,964;
(c) US 1,248,070;
(d) US 468, 838;
(e) CA 941,626;
(f) DE 2,926,836; and
(g) GB 1,396,088.
[66]
According to him, the spacing between the male element and the female element of the interlocking block system to create an automatic offset has existed in the prior art at least since 1970, for example in US patents 3,488,964 and 4,193,718. After being asked many questions on cross-examination, the expert witness Lefebvre finally agreed that the three essential elements taught by patent 295 are found only in the US KUBO patent 3,488,964 issued on January 13, 1970 and the US Warhendoff patent 4,193,718 issued on March 18, 1980.
[67]
[Original] The KUBO patent relates to a concrete block for use in a wall embankment for dissipating the waves of a body of water. One of its primary objects is to provide an improved concrete block for an embankment and a revetment capable of dissipating the greater part of the waves thereby preventing destruction of an embankment and a revetment due to said wave. The expert Bernardi in his rebuttal affidavit describes it as follows:
"19. U.S. patent number 3,844,964 (KUBO) describes a marine wave energy dissipating block. The specifications clearly demonstrate that it was not intended as a landscaping retaining structure. It seems to have been designed for concurrent use in revetment protection and wave dissipation. In any event, the actual configuration of the block is quite different. The Kubo block is substantially square to the rear of the block at the interface with the soil as compared to the long rectangular shape of the Risi block. It would appear to me that this Kubo block would be a nightmare to manufacture in fabricated moulds that have to be disassembled with every pour. This would be contrary to the situation which prevails in the case of the manufacture of both plaintiffs' and defendant's blocks in this case. It does not appear to be a block that can be mass produced on machinery normally intended for concrete products. Finally, I have researched the use of this particular patent and I have not uncovered any manufacture or use of this complicated product in the market. As such, I am of the opinion that the invention patented under this patent has not been put into practice. Finally, there is no sliding fit foreseen by the patent;"
[68]
A model block reflecting the Kubo patent was filed by the defendant at the hearing and became the object of much discussion. At first blush, the shape of this model is very different from traditional retaining wall building blocks. Its appearance is so outlandish that no one would seriously consider it to be useful in the construction of a wall the purpose of which is to retain land. The Kubo patent teaches some of the elements which may be found in patent 295, although it is intended for a different purpose but, according to Mr. Bernardi, there is no sliding fit foreseen by it and the patent has never been put into practice. Moreover, the Kubo patent does not provide for a plurality of projections and for corner blocks, whereas patent 295 does. Although the Kubo patent, dating back to 1970, has expired, there is no evidence that anyone, including the defendant, has ever used it.
[69]
The Wahrendoff patent is more recent having been issued on March 18, 1980. It deals with chevron-shaped concrete blocks connected together to form a retaining wall. This type of block has been in use by the defendant from time to time. The invention is formed from moulded blocks the upper side of which is of protruding roof-shaped convex configuration and the under side of which is of correspondingly roof-shaped reflected in a concave configuration. The expert Bernardi describes that patent as follows in paragraph 18 of his reply affidavit:
"18. U.S. patent number 4,193,718 describes a retaining wall system of vertically stacked chevron-shaped concrete blocks. The stacking element of this system relies on the roof shaped configuration of the blocks as opposed to the use of projections and recesses. In fact the question of a preset inclination is not even discussed in the objects of the patent. I am aware of the use of these blocks in the past and I may confirm that their use has been completely surpassed by the 295 block commercialized by the plaintiff Risi and its licensees. Another major difference in the system is that the offset is created by a base block. Such offset is determined by the shape and placement of the special base block. This system therefore requires a foundation of cast-in-place concrete. This was exactly one of the
disadvantages
of the prior art that the 295 patent sought to address. This patent system was therefore more complicated to manufacture and install than the 295 patented block and required much more skilled labour. Furthermore, this block does not even compare to the 295 patented block in terms of
adaptability
as it concerns for example corners and curves; Finally, I wish to point out that a man skilled in the field, knows that these particular blocks should not be placed directly on the ground, given their particular configuration."
[70]
It is quite apparent from the above comments that the essential criteria taught in patent 295 are not all present in the Wahrendoff patent. The more striking difference, in my view, is that the projecting and recess means are not really projections and recesses but the convex and concave configurations of the Wahrendoff blocks. As mentioned by Mr. Bernardi, these chevron-shaped blocks have been totally eclipsed by the arrival of patent 295.
[71]
My conclusion, therefore, is that patent 295 has not been invalidated by prior art.
11- Allegations Under The Copyright
Act And The Trade-marks Act
[72]
As mentioned at the outset of these reasons for judgment, the plaintiffs alleged in their statement of claim that the defendant's activities in this matter violated several sections of the
Trade-marks Act
and the
Copyright Act
. No evidence was introduced by the plaintiffs to that effect and for all intents and purposes they are deemed to have dropped those allegations.
12- Validity Of Patent 296
[73]
[Translation] In its original action Risi Stone alleged that Permacon had infringed patent 1,204,296 (patent 296), but it thereafter dropped this allegation. In its original counterclaim Permacon argued that patent 296 was invalid. In February 1995 Risi Stone asked that the defendant's counterclaim with respect to patent 296 be struck out or withdrawn on the ground that Risi Stone had dropped patent 296 from its action and that therefore the infringement action was now based only on patent 295. On February 16, 1995 I dismissed Risi Stone's application for the reasons outlined in my decision. Accordingly, Permacon was allowed to challenge the validity of patent 296 in the proceedings.
[74]
In its counterclaim Permacon alleged that patent 296 is invalid because the so-called invention is the same as that described in patent 295 and that two patents cannot be issued to protected the same invention; because the claims of patent 296 are ambiguous, are broader in scope than the invention and have been used by other persons; because the invention was described in prior patents; because it had been in public use and on sale in Canada for more than two years before the patent application was filed; and because the invention is obvious. In short, it made the same arguments as against patent 295.
[75]
As I explained in my reasons for the above order, patents 295 and 296 result from the division imposed by the Patent Office after a single patent application was filed by Risi Stone. The two patents describe a concrete block intended to be incorporated into a retaining wall system.
[76]
Patent 296 teaches the same invention as patent 295, with the following added characteristic: reversing the blocks in every other row (the front facing the back) makes it possible to build a smooth and vertical wall. Consequently, all the discussions and arguments about patent 295 apply equally to patent 296, with one exception, and therefore lead to the same result.
[77]
The exception in question is that Permacon claims that patent 296 is invalid because it is not useful since a vertically built wall will tend to fall or at least to give the impression of falling. The expert witness Lefebvre wrote the following on this subject in paragraph 71 of his affidavit:
[Translation]
"In the case of a simple low wall without headers, built solely by interlocking blocks one on top of another and eliminating the automatic offset by alternating nonreversed blocks with reversed blocks, the play of the recess means and the projecting means will necessarily be taken up by the outward movement of the upper blocks vis-à-vis the lower blocks as a result of the pushing of the earth, meaning that the resulting wall will not be perfectly vertical but will necessarily incline outwards. Such an outward inclination is totally unacceptable in building a low retaining wall (see arts. 24 and 25)."
[78]
In this regard, it must be remembered that before patent 295 the desired inclination was produced through a base inclined in the appropriate direction and at the appropriate angle. Patent 296 therefore teaches how to build a smooth, vertical wall with the blocks described in patent 295. If the inclination of the wall toward the earth is desired, the base must be prepared accordingly. As regards the special characteristic that patent 296 adds to patent 295, namely alternately reversing the blocks to produce a vertical structure, there is no evidence that this characteristic is invalid.
[79]
As a result, patent 296 is not invalid on the ground of non-utility or on any other ground.
[80]
Accordingly, the plaintiffs' action is allowed and the defendant's counterclaim is dismissed. The whole with costs [see footnote 11].
Action allowed;
counterclaim dismissed.
