Brown, J.
: This is an application for judicial review by Sivashankar Navaratnam [the Applicant] under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 of a decision by an immigration officer [the Officer] of Citizenship and Immigration Canada, dated August 28, 2013, wherein the Officer refused the Applicant's pre-removal risk assessment application [PRRA] and determined that he was not a Convention Refugee or a person in need of protection.
[2]
This application is granted for the following reasons:
[3]
The Applicant was born on June 23, 1979 in Sri Lanka (Jaffna), and raised in Mannar, which is situated in the north of the country. He is a Citizen of Sri Lanka of Tamil ethnicity and Hindu faith. He came to Canada on September 6, 2010 and claimed refugee protection on September 8, 2010. His claim was refused by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] on August 4, 2011. The Applicant applied for judicial review of the RPD's decision, but leave was dismissed November 30, 2011 (IMM-6071-11). The Applicant made an application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds [H&C]. His H&C application was refused by Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC] on March 23, 2013. He applied for a PRRA which was rejected (by the same CIC Officer) on August 23, 2013. The Applicant filed an application for leave and judicial review of the PRRA on November 20, 2013, subsequent to which this Court ordered a stay of the Applicant's removal on December 10, 2013 pending the outcome of this application. On November 21, 2014 the Court granted leave to apply for judicial review.
[4]
I mention these facts to emphasize that the PRRA Officer's decision of August, 2013 was given some 18 months ago, and that the decision on the underlying refugee claim of August 2011 to which the PRRA Officer referred, was rendered 44 months ago.
[5]
As to the standard of review, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Supreme Court of Canada held that a standard of review analysis is unnecessary where "the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question." The question of whether the PRRA Officer applied the right legal test is a question of law that should be reviewed on the correctness standard of review:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 50, the Supreme Court of Canada explained what is required of a court reviewing on the correctness standard of review:
When applying the correctness standard, a reviewing court will not show deference to the decision maker's reasoning process; it will rather undertake its own analysis of the question. The analysis will bring the court to decide whether it agrees with the determination of the decision maker; if not, the court will substitute its own view and provide the correct answer. From the outset, the court must ask whether the tribunal's decision was correct.
[6]
The question as to whether or not the PRRA decision is reasonable is a question of mixed fact and law and should be reviewed on the reasonableness standard:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47, the Supreme Court of Canada explained what is required of a court reviewing on the reasonableness standard of review:
A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[7]
The Applicant submitted in his PRRA application that he was at risk of persecution or harm in Sri Lanka from the Sri Lankan army, government and paramilitary groups associated with the government for the following reasons: (1) he is a Tamil from the North of Sri Lanka; (2) he will be perceived to be a supporter or a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE]; (3) his age profile as a young Tamil male from Jaffna; (4) past allegations and persecution he experience; (5) he will be returning as a failed asylum claimant. I emphasize that the Applicant identified, and the Officer acknowledged as a ground for his PRRA, that the Applicant would be returning as a failed asylum claimant if his PRRA was rejected.
[8]
After surveying key findings of the 2011 RPD decision, the PRRA Officer said that the Applicant had simply restated his case without addressing the credibility concerns raised by the RPD. In substance, the Officer said, the risks identified by the Applicant in his PRRA application were the same as those heard by the RPD. The Officer explained that a PRRA application is not an appeal of the RPD decision, which is final "subject only to new, different or additional risk developments that could not have been contemplated by the RPD". The PRRA Officer also found that the Applicant's past treatment, in and of itself, did not warrant a granting of protection which finding is not controversial.
[9]
However, the Officer found that the new evidence filed by the Applicant for the PRRA, namely a police report and a letter by the Applicant's father regarding threats following his departure for Canada, did not lead to a different conclusion than that of the RPD. The Officer rejected and thereafter ignored both the father's letter and the police report from Sri Lanka. The Officer gave three reasons for rejecting both the father's letter and the police report. The Court's comments follow each:
(1) the letter was rejected because of several matters the Officer wanted information on, including police progress in the matter, no threatening visits since the date of the letter, why other than not paying ransom the perpetrators of the threatening visits are interested in the Applicant, lack of corroboration of the visits, the letter's failure to specifically identify the perpetrators, and an explanation of how the perpetrators would kill the Applicant if they did not know where he was;
Court comment
: Several errors are made in the assessment of the letter and police report. It is well established that a demand for documentary corroboration is not warranted without valid grounds to do so, which were absent in this case:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It is an error to focus exclusively on what is not submitted in documents and fail to undertake any meaningful analysis of written testimony, as happened here:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and cases cited therein. It is an error to dismiss evidence (as the Officer appears to have done) based on the fact that other evidence would have been more desirable: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In asking the father to "identify" the extortionists, the Officer demanded too much; few if any criminals identify themselves to their victims. To ask how they would kill the Applicant is to show how unreasonable that line of complaint is - extortionists operate on fear and it is obvious they can only carry out their threat if they had the Applicant's whereabouts. And it is unclear what additional reasons the panel expected the extortionists to have for seeking the Applicant, and equally unclear why the absence of additional reasons is relevant. It is clear that the extortionists wanted to be paid.
(2) The letters were copies and missing original envelopes;
Court comment
: this finding is reasonable. Counsel for the Applicant advised that counsel routinely send copies and keep the originals on file, suggesting some sort of fairness procedure was warranted before the Officer rejected this new evidence on this ground. I am not prepared to rule against this finding or on the alleged practice of filing copies and not originals. I note the duty of counsel to put their best foot forward and to comply with the applicable rules regarding documents. I recognize that lawyers tend to keep originals on file and perhaps they should tell the PRRA Officer the originals are in their files where there is a concern that critical originals might go missing if the originals are filed. Perhaps parties must change their practice and give the originals to the RPD if that is indeed the RPD's practice, but I make no ruling in this regard.
(3) The two documents predated the H&C but had not been submitted at that time the Officer conducted the previous H&C;
Court comment
: Counsel noted
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the position that Officers considering both an H&C and PRRA must consider the totality of the evidence in both determination in making the decision in each, a proposition with which I might agree, but it does not appear that these decisions were made at the same time albeit they were made by the same Officer. That said, I know of no rule that renders inadmissible or allows an Officer to ignore new evidence, on the basis that it could have been but was not filed previously, and I am not prepared to adopt such a rule in this case.
[10]
Overall and read as a whole, the Officer acted unreasonably in rejecting the father's letter and the police report because one cannot discern which of the three stated reasons was determinative, although likely the first ground disposed of both documents. In my view, the PRRA Officer improperly excluded relevant new evidence, and therefore the decision must be set aside.
[11]
Additional concerns were raised by the Applicant which reinforce the decision to order a redetermination, the principal one being the Officer's failure to deal with the Applicant's profile as a failed asylum seeker. The Officer identified this as a ground of review. However other than mentioning this ground at the outset, the PRRA Officer does not assess or even mention that the Applicant is a failed asylum seeker anywhere else in the decision. Therefore this case is similar to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] in which the RPD failed to assess the implications of returning Tamils from the north who are failed asylum seekers, notwithstanding there was evidence on the record, as there is in the case at bar, that failed asylum seekers are at material risk. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 50-51 I ruled:
[50] On review of the record before the RPD there was evidence that failed refugee claimants returning to Sri Lanka have been both detained and tortured (
Freedom from Torture Report
at 7; UNHCR Guidelines at 8;
Risk of failed asylum seekers of Tamil ethnicity upon return to Sri Lanka
,). The RPD did not refer to this issue not to any specific documents in this regard. Nor does it address the specific concern of a returning failed refugee claimant. In my respectful view, the RPD had a duty to consider whether there is a serious possibility of persecution of the applicant as a failed refugee returnee.
[51] As a result, I find the RPD's conclusion does not meet the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, requirements of "justification, transparency and intelligibility" (at para 47). Given the seriousness of the potential consequences and the absence of both consideration and reasoning on this point, in my view the RPD's decision is unreasonable and must be set aside.
[12]
There is a further reason to set aside the decision below. In assessing persecution, the Officer ruled that "the evidence before me does not support that the applicant faces a personalized risk of harm there as a result". This was the wrong test. The Federal Court of Appeal rejected "personalized risk of harm" as the legal test some time ago, stating "the applicant does not have to show that he had himself been persecuted in the past or would himself be persecuted in the future ..." It is sufficient, and the Federal Court of Appeal stated, that persecution is established if it is "committed or likely to be committed against members of a group to which he belonged":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA). Applying the wrong legal test requires the decision to be set aside.
[13]
I raised with both parties at the hearing the Court's concern about relying on outdated decisions in deciding this judicial review. I appreciate the general rule is that judicial review is conducted on the record subject to the filing of admissible new evidence. And while the RPD makes a comprehensive assessment under sections 96 and 97, the PRRA Officer on his or her subsequent review must also assess risk. But it is well known that the situation in Sri Lanka is changing. The original RPD decision was made in what might be called the after-glow of the peace. On December 17, 2010 the PRD identified a persuasive decision relaxing its position concerning the return to Sri Lanka of Tamil males from the North. However, this early optimism was misplaced as evidenced by Canadian and other refugee authorities. In December 2012 the UNHCR replaced its 2010 Guidelines for Tamils returning to Sri Lanka because the circumstances for Tamils returning to Sri Lanka had deteriorated. In the case at bar, the RPD's 2011 decision relied on the 2010 UNHCR Guidelines which while then current, are now no longer current.
[14]
The PRRA Officer also relied on the 2010 UNHCR Guidelines to the extent he relied on the earlier RPD country condition findings, although by then they no longer applied. I must add that the PRRA Officer was under a duty to consult up to date country condition documents. The fact that the PRRA Officer failed to identify, assess or even mention the 2012 UNCHR Guidelines requires that this decision, made as it was in August 2013, be set aside.
[15]
Since the change in the UNHCR Guidelines, the situation for Tamils returning to Sri Lanka appears to have deteriorated further. In April, 2013 the Prime Minister of Canada's special envoy to Sri Lanka, after his investigation, reported that what was happening to Tamils in Sri Lanka was "soft ethnic cleansing". In October 2013, the Prime Minister of Canada boycotted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting hosted by Sri Lanka because of Sri Lanka's human rights issues including treatment of Tamils. The Swiss ceased removals to Sri Lanka in later 2013. In terms of the position adopted by Canadian refugee authorities, I find it very noteworthy that on November 7, 2014 the RPD revoked its 2010 Tamil-related persuasive decision: see
Policy Note: Notice of Revocation of Persuasive Decision VA9-02166
. These are all matters of public record.
[16]
I appreciate that all these new developments were not before the PRRA Officer. However, a major point of a PRRA is to make sure Canada has got its risk assessment right before a claimant is deported. The PRRA Officer is the last line of risk assessment, subject to the removal officer's limited decision. There is no point in having a PRRA if it is to proceed on information known to be incorrect. Given this and the fluid situation in Sri Lanka concerning Tamils generally and returning failed asylum seekers specifically, in remitting the matter for redetermination by a different PRRA officer, in my view it is appropriate that new evidence be filed.
[17]
Neither party proposed a question for certification, and I see no question to certify.
JUDGMENT
[18]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is granted, the decision of the PRRA Officer is set aside and remanded to a different officer for redetermination, the Applicant is at liberty to file new evidence on the redetermination by the new PRRA Officer, no question is certified and there is no order as to costs.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire qu'a présentée Sivashankar Navaratnam [le demandeur] en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27, relativement à une décision datée du 28 août 2013 par laquelle un agent d'immigration [l'agent] de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada a rejeté sa demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi [ERAR] et conclu qu'il n'avait ni la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger.
[2]
La demande est accueillie, pour les motifs qui suivent.
[3]
Le demandeur est né le 23 juin 1979 au Sri Lanka (Jaffna) et a grandi à Mannar, une ville située dans le nord du pays. Il est un citoyen du Sri Lanka d'origine tamoule et de religion hindoue. Il est arrivé au Canada le 6 septembre 2010 et a demandé l'asile le 8 septembre 2010. Sa demande d'asile a été refusée par la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] le 4 août 2011. Il a présenté une demande de contrôle judiciaire concernant la décision de la SPR, mais l'autorisation lui a été refusée le 30 novembre 2011 (IMM-6071-11). Il a présenté une demande de résidence permanente pour motifs d'ordre humanitaire [CH]. Sa demande CH a été refusée par Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada [CIC] le 23 mars 2013. Il a présenté une demande d'ERAR qui a été refusée (par le même agent de CIC) le 23 août 2013. Il a présenté une demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire concernant l'ERAR le 20 novembre 2013, après quoi la Cour a ordonné que l'on sursoie à son renvoi le 10 décembre 2013, en attendant l'issue de la présente demande. Le 21 novembre 2014, la Cour a accordé l'autorisation de présenter une demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[4]
Si je mentionne ces faits c'est pour souligner que la décision de l'agent d'ERAR datée d'août 2013 a été rendue il y a dix-mois environ et que la décision relative à la demande d'asile sous-jacente d'août 2011 à laquelle l'agent d'ERAR a fait référence a été rendue il y a quarante-quatre mois de cela.
[5]
Pour ce qui est de la norme de contrôle applicable, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 62 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu qu'il est inutile de procéder à une analyse de la norme de contrôle applicable si « la jurisprudence établit déjà de manière satisfaisante le degré de déférence correspondant à une catégorie de questions en particulier ». La question de savoir si l'agent d'ERAR a appliqué le bon critère juridique est une question de droit qu'il convient de contrôler selon la norme de la décision correcte:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 50, la Cour suprême du Canada a expliqué ce que l'on attend d'un tribunal qui procède à un contrôle en se fondant sur la norme de la décision correcte:
La cour de révision qui applique la norme de la décision correcte n'acquiesce pas au raisonnement du décideur; elle entreprend plutôt sa propre analyse au terme de laquelle elle décide si elle est d'accord ou non avec la conclusion du décideur. En cas de désaccord, elle substitue sa propre conclusion et rend la décision qui s'impose. La cour de révision doit se demander dès le départ si la décision du tribunal administratif était la bonne.
[6]
La question de savoir si la décision rendue à la suite de l'ERAR est raisonnable ou non est une question mixte de fait et de droit qu'il convient de contrôler selon la norme de la raisonnabilité:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47, la Cour suprême du Canada a expliqué ce que l'on attend d'un tribunal qui procède à un contrôle en se fondant sur la norme de la raisonnabilité:
Il est loisible au tribunal administratif d'opter pour l'une ou l'autre des différentes solutions rationnelles acceptables. La cour de révision se demande dès lors si la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité. Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[7]
Dans sa demande d'ERAR, le demandeur a fait valoir qu'il risquait d'être victime de persécution ou de mauvais traitements au Sri Lanka de la part de l'armée nationale, du gouvernement et de groupes paramilitaires associés au gouvernement, et ce, pour les raisons suivantes: 1) il est un Tamoul originaire du nord du Sri Lanka, 2) il sera considéré comme un partisan ou un membre des Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul [TLET], 3) son profil d'âge en tant que jeune Tamoul de sexe masculin originaire de Jaffna, 4) les allégations et la persécution dont il a été victime dans le passé, 5) il sera renvoyé en tant que demandeur d'asile débouté. Je souligne que le demandeur a mentionné - et l'agent a reconnu ce fait en tant que motif de son ERAR - qu'il serait renvoyé en tant que demandeur d'asile débouté en cas de rejet de sa demande d'ERAR.
[8]
Après avoir passé en revue les principales conclusions énoncées dans la décision de la SPR de 2011, l'agent d'ERAR a déclaré que le demandeur n'avait fait que réitérer ses arguments sans traiter des réserves évoquées par la SPR quant à sa crédibilité. En substance, a dit l'agent, les risques dont le demandeur a fait état dans sa demande d'ERAR étaient les mêmes que ceux que la SPR avait entendus. Il a expliqué qu'une demande d'ERAR n'est pas un appel de la décision de la SPR, laquelle est définitive [traduction] « sous réserve uniquement d'éléments de risque nouveaux, différents ou supplémentaires que la SPR n'aurait pas pu envisager ». Il a également conclu que le traitement que le demandeur avait subi dans le passé ne justifiait pas en soi l'octroi d'une protection; il s'agit là d'une conclusion non controversée.
[9]
L'agent a toutefois conclu que les nouveaux éléments de preuve que le demandeur a produits pour l'ERAR, soit un rapport de police et une lettre de son père au sujet de menaces proférées à la suite de son départ pour le Canada, ne menaient pas à une conclusion différente de celle de la SPR. Il a rejeté à la fois la lettre du père et le rapport de police du Sri Lanka et en a ensuite fait abstraction. Il a donné trois raisons pour rejeter ces deux documents. Les commentaires de la Cour suivent chacune de ces raisons:
1) La lettre a été rejetée à cause de plusieurs questions à propos desquelles l'agent voulait obtenir des informations, dont les progrès de la police dans l'affaire, l'absence de visites menaçantes depuis la date de la lettre, la raison pour laquelle, hormis le fait de ne pas avoir payé une rançon, les responsables des visites menaçantes s'intéressent au demandeur, l'absence de corroboration des visites en question, le fait que la lettre n'identifie pas expressément les responsables, de même qu'une explication de ce que les auteurs des menaces auraient pu faire pour tuer le demandeur s'ils ignoraient où il se trouvait.
Commentaires de la Cour
: Plusieurs erreurs ont été commises dans l'évaluation de la lettre et du rapport de police. Il est bien établi qu'une demande de corroboration documentaire n'est pas justifiée s'il n'y a pas de motifs valables pour le faire, lesquels sont absents en l'espèce:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Il est erroné de mettre exclusivement l'accent sur ce qui n'est pas présenté dans des documents et de ne pas analyser de manière sérieuse un témoignage écrit, comme cela s'est passé ici:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], ainsi que les décisions qui y sont citées. Il est également erroné d'écarter une preuve (comme l'agent semble l'avoir fait) en s'appuyant sur le fait que d'autres éléments auraient été plus souhaitables: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . En demandant que le père [traduction] « identifie » les extorqueurs, l'agent en a trop exigé; rares sont les criminels, sinon aucun, qui s'identifient auprès de leurs victimes. Demander comment ils pourraient faire pour tuer le demandeur, c'est montrer à quel point ce type de reproche est déraisonnable - les extorqueurs exploitent la peur qu'ils suscitent, et il est évident qu'ils ne pouvaient mettre à exécution leur menace que s'ils savaient où le demandeur se trouvait. De plus, on ne voit pas clairement quels autres raisons les extorqueurs auraient dû avoir, selon le tribunal, pour être à la recherche du demandeur et, également, pourquoi l'absence d'autres raisons est pertinente. Il est clair que les extorqueurs voulaient qu'on les paie.
2) Les lettres étaient des copies et il manquait les enveloppes originales.
Commentaires de la Cour
: Cette conclusion est raisonnable. L'avocate du demandeur a affirmé que les avocats envoient systématiquement des copies et conservent les originaux dans le dossier, ce qui donne à penser qu'une sorte de procédure en matière d'équité était de mise avant que l'agent rejette ce nouvel élément de preuve pour ce motif. Je ne suis pas disposé à me prononcer contre cette conclusion ou sur la prétendue pratique consistant à produire des copies et non des originaux. Je signale que les avocats sont tenus de présenter leur cause sous son meilleur jour et de se conformer aux règles qui régissent la production de documents. Je suis conscient que les avocats ont tendance à conserver les originaux dans les dossiers, et il faudrait peut-être qu'ils le disent à l'agent d'ERAR pour éviter que l'on puisse considérer que des originaux d'une importance cruciale sont manquants. Il serait peut-être bon que les parties changent de méthode et remettent les originaux à la SPR s'il s'agit effectivement de la façon de faire de la SPR, mais je ne me prononcerai pas sur ce point.
3) Les deux documents dataient d'avant la demande CH mais ils n'avaient pas été produits au moment où l'agent a effectué l'analyse CH antérieure.
Commentaires de la Cour
: L'avocate a invoqué la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  à l'appui de la thèse selon laquelle les agents qui examinent à la fois une demande CH et une demande d'ERAR doivent prendre en compte la totalité des éléments de preuve pour se prononcer sur chacune; il s'agit là d'une thèse à laquelle je souscrirais, mais il ne semble pas que ces décisions aient été rendues en même temps, même si elles l'ont été par le même agent. Cela dit, je ne connais aucune règle qui rend irrecevables de nouveaux éléments de preuve ou qui permet à un agent d'en faire abstraction parce qu'ils auraient pu être produits mais ne l'ont pas été antérieurement, et je ne suis pas disposé à adopter une telle règle en l'espèce.
[10]
Dans l'ensemble et en examinant la situation globalement, l'agent a agi de manière déraisonnable en rejetant la lettre du père et le rapport de police car on ne peut distinguer laquelle des trois raisons mentionnées était déterminante, même si, vraisemblablement, le premier motif a réglé le cas des deux documents. À mon avis, l'agent d'ERAR a exclu à tort de nouveaux éléments de preuve pertinents et, de ce fait, il y a lieu d'infirmer la décision.
[11]
Le demandeur a exprimé d'autres préoccupations qui renforcent la décision d'ordonner une nouvelle décision, la principale étant que l'agent n'a pas traité du profil du demandeur en tant que demandeur d'asile débouté. Il a affirmé qu'il s'agissait là d'un motif de contrôle. Cependant, à part le fait de mentionner ce motif au début, l'agent d'ERAR n'a pas évalué, ni même mentionné, ailleurs dans la décision le fait que le demandeur est un demandeur d'asile débouté. La présente espèce ressemble donc à l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], dans laquelle la SPR n'avait pas évalué les répercussions auxquelles s'exposent à leur retour les Tamouls du Nord qui sont des demandeurs d'asile déboutés, et ce, même s'il y avait une preuve dans le dossier, comme c'est le cas en l'espèce, que le demandeur d'asile débouté s'exposait à un risque important. Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 50 et 51, j'ai décrété ce qui suit:
[50] L'examen du dossier présenté à la SPR a démontré que des demandeurs d'asile déboutés et rapatriés au Sri Lanka avaient été détenus et torturés (
Freedom from Torture Report
au par. 7; principes directeurs du HCR au par. 8;
risque auquel sont exposés les demandeurs d'asile d'origine ethnique tamoule déboutés qui sont rapatriés au Sri Lanka
). La SPR n'a fait référence à aucun document particulier à cet égard. De plus, elle n'a pas répondu à la préoccupation particulière d'un demandeur d'asile débouté qui est ensuite rapatrié. En toute déférence, la SPR était tenue de déterminer s'il y avait un risque grave de persécution du demandeur en qualité de demandeur d'asile débouté et rapatrié.
[51] Par conséquent, j'arrive à la conclusion que la décision de la SPR ne satisfait pas au critère établi dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, selon lequel: « le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel » (au par. 47). Compte tenu de la gravité des conséquences éventuelles et de l'absence d'examen et de raisonnement sur cette question, je suis d'avis que la décision de la SPR est déraisonnable et doit être annulée.
[12]
Il y a une autre raison pour infirmer la décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle. Au moment d'évaluer la persécution, l'agent a jugé que [traduction] « la preuve qui m'est soumise ne confirme pas que le demandeur s'expose de ce fait à un risque personnel de préjudice ». Il s'agissait du mauvais critère. La Cour d'appel fédérale a rejeté le « risque personnel de préjudice » en tant que critère juridique il y a quelque temps de cela, en disant: « le requérant n'[avait] pas à prouver qu'il avait été persécuté lui-même dans le passé ou qu'il serait lui-même persécuté à l'avenir [...] ». Cela est suffisant et, comme la Cour d'appel fédérale l'a déclaré, les actes de persécution sont établis s'ils sont « commis ou susceptibles d'être commis à l'égard des membres d'un groupe auquel [le demandeur] appartenait »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF). Le fait d'avoir appliqué le mauvais critère juridique oblige à infirmer la décision.
[13]
À l'audience, j'ai fait part aux deux parties du souci de la Cour quant au fait de se fonder sur des décisions désuètes dans le cadre du présent contrôle judiciaire. Je suis conscient de la règle générale selon laquelle un contrôle judiciaire est fondé sur le dossier, sous réserve du dépôt de nouveaux éléments de preuve recevables. Et même si la SPR procède à une évaluation exhaustive en vertu des articles 96 et 97, lors de son examen ultérieur l'agent d'ERAR doit évaluer lui aussi les risques. Mais il est bien connu qu'au Sri Lanka la situation est en train de changer. La décision initiale de la SPR a été rendue dans ce que l'on pourrait appeler les dernières lueurs de la paix. Le 17 décembre 2010, la SPR a mentionné une décision convaincante qui lui a permis d'assouplir sa position au sujet du retour au Sri Lanka de Tamouls de sexe masculin originaires du Nord. Cependant, ce premier élan d'optimisme n'était pas fondé, comme l'ont démontré des instances canadiennes et d'autres instances en matière de réfugiés. En décembre 2012, le HCR a remplacé ses Lignes directrices de 2010 concernant les Tamouls retournant au Sri Lanka parce que la situation de ces derniers s'était détériorée. En l'espèce, la décision que la SPR a rendue en 2011 reposait sur les Lignes directrices du HCR de 2010 qui, si elles étaient en vigueur à l'époque, ne le sont plus aujourd'hui.
[14]
L'agent d'ERAR s'est également fondé sur les Lignes directrices du HCR de 2010 dans la mesure où il s'est appuyé sur les conclusions antérieures de la SPR à propos de la situation dans le pays, même si, à ce moment-là, elles ne s'appliquaient plus. Il me faut ajouter que l'agent d'ERAR était tenu de consulter des documents à jour sur la situation dans le pays. Le fait d'avoir omis d'évaluer, voire de mentionner les Lignes directrices du HCR de 2012 exige que cette décision, rendue en août 2013, soit infirmée.
[15]
Depuis le changement apporté aux Lignes directrices du HCR, la situation des Tamouls retournant au Sri Lanka semble s'être détériorée encore plus. En avril 2013, l'envoyé spécial du premier ministre du Canada au Sri Lanka a signalé, après son enquête, que ce que les Tamouls du Sri Lanka vivaient était une « épuration ethnique douce ». En octobre 2013, le premier ministre du Canada a boycotté la Réunion des chefs de gouvernement des pays du Commonwealth organisée par le Sri Lanka à cause des problèmes de ce pays sur le plan des droits de la personne, et le traitement des Tamouls en faisait partie. Les Suisses ont cessé de renvoyer des Sri-Lankais dans leur pays à la fin de 2013. Pour ce qui est de la position adoptée par les autorités canadiennes en matière de réfugiés, il vaut vraiment la peine de signaler, selon moi, que le 7 novembre 2014 la SPR a révoqué sa décision à caractère persuasif de 2010 concernant les Tamouls: voir l'
Avis de révocation d'une décision à caractère persuasif VA9-02166
. Il s'agit toutes là de questions de notoriété publique.

Je suis conscient que tous ces faits nouveaux n'ont pas été soumis à l'agent d'ERAR. Cependant, un ERAR a pour objet important de veiller à ce que le Canada évalue bien les risques avant que l'on expulse un demandeur. L'agent d'ERAR représente la dernière ligne de l'examen des risques, sous réserve de la décision d'une portée limitée de l'agent chargé du renvoi. Rien ne sert d'effectuer un ERAR s'il est fondé sur des informations que l'on sait inexactes. Compte tenu de ce fait et de l'instabilité de la situation au Sri Lanka pour ce qui est des Tamouls en général et, plus précisément, des demandeurs d'asile déboutés qui sont de retour, je suis d'avis qu'en renvoyant l'affaire à un agent d'ERAR différent en vue d'une nouvelle décision, il serait utile que l'on dépose de nouveaux éléments de preuve.

Ni l'une ni l'autre des parties n'ont proposé une question à certifier, et je n'en vois aucune à certifier.
JUGEMENT
[18]
