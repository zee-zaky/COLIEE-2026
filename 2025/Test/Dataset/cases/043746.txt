[1]
Near, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board), dated August 5, 2011. The Board found that the Applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27.
[2]
For the reasons set out below, the application is dismissed.
I.
Facts
[3]
The Principal Applicant, Raghuja Ranjani Mallampally, and her adult son, Sam Manohar Embeti (or the Associate Applicant) are citizens of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (St. Vincent). Having Indian nationality and race, they form part of a small minority on the island. The Principal Applicant was also the only single female doctor living in St. Vincent and was often referred to by a racially derogatory name.
[4]
She nonetheless became an expert witness and testified against the accused in several rape and murder trials. As a result, she started receiving verbal threats from convicted criminals, sometimes in person but mostly by telephone. She also experienced break-ins at her home.
[5]
The Principal Applicant and Associate Applicant arrived in Canada on December 6, 2009 and October 4, 2009 respectively. The Principal Applicant claimed her decision to leave was precipitated by an incident involving the killing of her dog and leaving of a knife outside the home.
[6]
Fearful of having to return to St. Vincent because of the previous threats and incidents, they brought claims for refugee protection on April 21, 2010 (by the Principal Applicant) and June 9, 2010 (by the Associate Applicant).
II.
Decision Under Review
[7]
At the outset, the Board faulted the Applicants for not providing a satisfactory explanation as to why they delayed in making refugee claims, particularly since as a medical doctor the Principal Applicant has a relatively high degree of sophistication compared to other refugee claimants.
[8]
While the Board accepted that the Applicants were subject to some degree of discrimination and harassment in St. Vincent over the years, it was not satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the Applicants left St. Vincent, or chose to stay and claim refugee status in Canada, because of a well-founded fear of persecution or a risk to their lives, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in St. Vincent.
[9]
The Applicants had not provided credible evidence that the critical incident, involving the killing of their dog and a knife being left behind as a warning, actually occurred. It was not articulated consistently and there was no police corroboration of the presence of the knife.
[10]
The Board acknowledged that the Applicants might be experiencing some or all of the symptoms set out by the psychologist but found it had not been established that the material elements of the claims caused or contributed to those symptoms or that any historic mistreatment they sustained in St. Vincent, had a substantially prejudicial effect, morally or physically, that would make it unreasonable for them to return to St. Vincent.
III.
Issues
[11]
This application raises the following issues:
(a) Did the Board err in its credibility findings?
(b) Did the Board err in finding that the harm suffered by the Applicants did not meet the criteria of serious and persistent harm or rise to the level of persecution?
(c) Did the Board err by not conducting an analysis under section 96?
(d) Did the Board err by determining that the Principal Applicant's delay in claiming refugee protection affected her credibility?
(e) Did the Board err in failing to consider the issue of state protection?
IV.
Standard of Review
[12]
Questions of fact, discretion and policy as well as questions where the legal issues cannot be easily separated from the factual issues generally attract a standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 51). In particular, credibility findings are reviewed according to this standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ no 732 at para 14).
[13]
Reasonableness refers to "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility" as well as "whether the decision falls with the range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47).
V.
Analysis
A.
Did the Board Err in its Credibility Findings?
[14]
The Applicants contest the Board's adverse credibility findings for a failure to properly consider the evidence before it and provide reasons that explain why it preferred certain pieces of evidence over others.
[15]
More specifically, they insist the Board ignored the preponderance of evidence regarding the profile of the Principal Applicant as a single, foreign-born doctor who testified in criminal court and that led to her family being targeted. Instead, the Board conducted a microscopic analysis and focused on the statement of the Associate Applicant at the Port of Entry (POE) suggesting that the knife was left in the backyard when he was not physically present in St. Vincent at the time. The sworn testimony of the Principal Applicant regarding the knife was rejected in favour of the police report, despite her efforts to ensure that accurate evidence could be provided to the Board.
[16]
By contrast, the Respondent maintains that the Applicants are asking the Court to reweigh the evidence. Two clear credibility findings were made regarding the police report and Associate Applicant's erroneous recitation of the location of the knife. The reasons identify the basis on which the decision was reached as the Board accepted the allegations of discrimination and harassment but found that in conjunction with the delay and credibility issues, the persecution claim was not established.
[17]
Where the Board makes a negative credibility finding, it must provide reasons in "clear and unmistakable terms" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA)). The Board met this requirement in its assessment of the Applicants' claims by citing an inconsistency regarding the location of the knife and failure to provide corroboration through the police report. Since the Principal Applicant considered this a critical incident in precipitating her decision to come to Canada, it was not unreasonable for the Board to place the emphasis it did on this issue.
[18]
Contrary to the Applicants' submissions, the Board provided a specific evidentiary basis for its finding, considered credibility in light of the totality of evidence before it (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), and addressed contradictory evidence (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ no 625 at para 28).
[19]
While the Board highlighted inconsistencies regarding the incident involving the knife and dog, it also acknowledged that the Applicants experienced some degree of discrimination and harassment over the years in St. Vincent and they might experience some or all of the symptoms as set out by the psychologist. Albeit rather brief in its assessment, the Board recognizes the Applicants' personal and professional circumstances.
[20]
The reasons provided for the adverse credibility findings are sufficient to allow this Court "to understand why the tribunal made its decision" and determine that the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes (see
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] SCJ 62 at para 16).
B.
Did the Board Err in Finding that the Harm Suffered by the Applicants did not Meet the Criteria of Serious and Persistent Harm or Rise to the Level of Persecution?
[21]
The Applicants submit that the Board was dismissive of their evidence of racial and other forms of persecution. Without proper analysis, the Board disposed of the issue simply by stating that it did not amount to serious harm.
[22]
The Respondent maintains that the Board was not dismissive of the treatment suffered by the Applicant but found that it did not cumulatively rise to the level of persecution. This demonstrates that it was aware of the relevant legal tests.
[23]
The Applicants have highlighted the recent decision of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ no 468 at para 7 where Justice Russel Zinn canvassed determinations on the meaning of persecution. He makes reference to a definition first considered in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  generally define persecution as a serious interference with a basic human right.
[24]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Federal Court of Appeal determined that incidents of discrimination in that case were "not serious or systematic enough to be characterized as persecution." At paragraph 3, the Court stressed:
[3] It is true that the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in the refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is true also that the identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination or harassment is not purely a question of fact but a mixed question of law and fact, legal concepts being involved. It remains, however, that, in all cases, it is for the Board to draw the conclusion in a particular factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein, and the intervention of this Court is not warranted unless the conclusion reached appears to be capricious or unreasonable.
[25]
Based on this passage in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Applicants emphasize that discrimination and harassment can amount to persecution and therefore their evidence should not have been dismissed quite so easily.
[26]
While I acknowledge that the Board could have more explicitly stated the legal test being employed, the conclusion reached is reasonable and in accordance with <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above.
[27]
The Board recognized that the Applicants had been "subject to some degree of discrimination and harassment", but still found that it had not been "established on the balance of probabilities that these forms of mistreatment and abuse, even when viewed cumulatively, would meet the criteria of serious and persistent harm or persecution." The discrimination and harassment experienced was simply not serious or persistent enough to amount to persecution, either singularly or cumulatively. The Board considered the factual context and conducted a balancing of various elements of the evidence that was neither capricious nor unreasonable.
[28]
The Board's conclusion is brief but as required by
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, above, makes clear why the decision was made. This Court must bear in mind the quoted passage referred to in that decision that states "[r]easons are not to be reviewed in a vacuum - the result is to be looked at in the context of the evidence, the parties' submissions and the process. Reasons do not have to be perfect. They do not have to be comprehensive" (para 18).
[29]
I therefore find that the Board reasonably concluded the treatment the Applicants experienced did not amount to persecution.
C.
Did the Board Err by not Conducting an Analysis Under Section 96?
[30]
For similar reasons, the Applicants insist that the Board is silent on any principled analysis of the Applicants' claims under section 96. As individuals of Indian descent, they are part of a small minority in St. Vincent and have been subjected to racial discrimination. The Principal Applicant's status as the only single female doctor on the island further exacerbates their feelings of vulnerability and fear.
[31]
However, I agree with the Respondent that there is nothing to suggest that the Board did not consider the basis of the Applicants' claim under section 96. At paragraph 2 of its reasons, the Board acknowledges the Principal Applicant's professional, gender and personal profile as a "wealthy Indian woman living alone and having provided expert evidence for the prosecution in other criminal cases as a medical doctor."
[32]
As noted above, the Board simply found that the discrimination experienced in St. Vincent did not reach the level required to advance a claim of persecution under section 96. It was reasonable for the Board to weigh the evidence before it in this manner.
D.
Did the Board Err by Determining that the Principal Applicant's Delay in Claiming Refugee Protection Affected her Credibility?
[33]
The Principal Applicant takes issue with the Board's finding that the delay in making a claim negatively affected her credibility. She explains that having entered the country as a visitor, she initiated a refugee claim before the six months expired. During her time in Canada, she continued to worry about returning to St. Vincent and attempted to inform herself of the various options available to foreign nationals who wished to immigrate. Moreover, the Board erroneously suggested that as a medical doctor she was more sophisticated and should have known about the refugee process, when she had a different image in her mind of who would be considered a refugee.
[34]
However, I am satisfied by the submissions of the Respondent that the Board's assessment of the Principal Applicant's delay in making a claim was reasonable.
[35]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Federal Court of Appeal determined that while a "delay in making a claim to refugee status is not a decisive factor in itself", it represents "a relevant element which the tribunal may take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant."
[36]
The Board considered the Principal Applicant's explanation for her delay but found this was "not satisfactory." Although in the country legally as a visitor at the time, it is reasonable to expect that the Principal Applicant would make a claim at the first possible opportunity and to determine that a failure to do so further undermines her subjective fear and credibility (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ no 965 at para 15). As the Respondent points out, the fact that she did not attempt to inform herself about the options available until her visitor's visa was about to expire supports the Board's conclusion.
[37]
In addition, the Board's reference to the Principal Applicant's sophistication as a medical doctor in not pursuing a refugee claim does not amount to an error. The Principal Applicant may have preferred that the Board give greater weight to her argument that she had a different image of refugees when initially learning about her options, it does not necessarily follow that the Board's approach is unreasonable. As the Respondent makes clear, it is within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes to expect that an educated and sophisticated individual who feared for her life to have some idea what her plans would be on arrival in Canada.
[38]
As a consequence, the Board did not commit any reviewable error in considering the delay in making a refugee claim and its impact on the Principal Applicant's credibility.
E.
Did the Board Err in Failing to Consider the Issue of State Protection?
[39]
As their final argument, the Applicants dispute the Board's lack of analysis on state protection, given extensive evidence provided in relation to state protection, including admissions by the police to the Principal Applicant. According to the Respondent, however, this argument does not account for the Board's finding that the Applicant lacked a subjective fear of persecution.
[40]
Having found issues associated with the Applicants' credibility based on a critical incident and that any discrimination or harassment experienced did not amount to persecution; I agree that it was unnecessary for the Board to analyze the issue of state protection and an error was not committed by failing to do so.
VI.
Conclusion
[41]
However briefly articulated, the Board's credibility findings, determination that the discrimination and harassment experienced did not rise to the level of persecution and analysis under section 96 were reasonable. Given these conclusions, the Board was also not required to conduct an analysis of state protection.
[42]
As a result, I dismiss this application for judicial review.
JUDGMENT
[43]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed.
.........................
Raghuja Ranjani  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire d'une décision, en date du 5 août 2011, par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) a refusé de reconnaître aux demandeurs la qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ou celle de personnes à protéger selon les articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande est rejetée.
I.
Les faits
[3]
La demanderesse principale, Raghuja Ranjani Mallampally, et son fils adulte, Sam Manohar Embeti (le codemandeur), sont des citoyens de Saint-Vincent-et-les Grenadines (Saint-Vincent). Comme ils sont de nationalité et de race indiennes, ils font partie d'une petite minorité vivant dans cette île. La demanderesse principale est par ailleurs la seule femme médecin célibataire à Saint-Vincent et elle se faisait souvent appeler par un qualificatif désobligeant à caractère raciste.
[4]
Elle est néanmoins devenue un témoin expert et a témoigné contre des accusés dans plusieurs procès pour viol et pour meurtre. De ce fait, elle a commencé à recevoir des menaces verbales d'individus reconnus coupables de crimes, parfois en personne, mais la plupart du temps par téléphone. Son domicile a également fait l'objet d'introductions par effraction.
[5]
La demanderesse principale et le codemandeur sont arrivés au Canada respectivement le 6 décembre 2009 et le 4 octobre 2009. La demanderesse principale affirme que sa décision de quitter Saint-Vincent avait été précipitée par un incident au cours duquel son chien avait été tué et un couteau avait été laissé sur place devant son domicile.
[6]
Craignant devoir retourner à Saint-Vincent en raison des menaces déjà proférées et d'incidents passés, les demandeurs ont présenté leurs demandes d'asile le 21 avril 2010 (dans le cas de la demanderesse principale) et le 9 juin 2010 (dans le cas du codemandeur).
II.
La décision contrôlée
[7]
D'entrée de jeu, la Commission a reproché aux demandeurs de ne pas avoir donné d'explications satisfaisantes au sujet de la raison pour laquelle ils avaient tardé à demander l'asile, d'autant plus qu'en tant que médecin, la demanderesse principale était une personne qui possédait un niveau d'éducation relativement élevé par comparaison avec les autres demandeurs d'asile.
[8]
Tout en acceptant que les demandeurs avaient fait l'objet d'un certain degré de discrimination et de harcèlement à Saint-Vincent au fil des ans, la Commission n'a pas estimé qu'il avait été établi, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'ils avaient quitté Saint-Vincent ou décidé de rester au Canada et d'y demander l'asile parce qu'ils craignaient avec raison d'être persécutés, d'être exposés à une menace à leur vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités, ou au risque de torture à Saint-Vincent.
[9]
Les demandeurs n'ont pas établi, au moyen d'éléments de preuve crédibles, que l'incident au cours duquel leur chien avait été tué et un couteau avait été laissé sur place en signe d'avertissement avait effectivement eu lieu. Le récit de cet incident n'a pas été exposé de façon cohérente et il n'y avait aucune corroboration policière au sujet de la présence du couteau.
[10]
La Commission a acceptéque les demandeurs étaient atteints d'une partie ou de la totalité des symptômes mentionnés par la psychologue, mais a estimé qu'il n'avait pas été établi que les éléments importants des demandes d'asile avaient causé ces symptômes ou avaient contribué à leur apparition, ou qu'un mauvais traitement que les demandeurs avaient pu subir par le passé à Saint-Vincent avait eu un effet substantiellement préjudiciable sur eux, sur le plan moral ou physique, d'une façon qui rendrait déraisonnable leur retour à Saint-Vincent.
III.
Questions en litige
[11]
La présente demande soulève les questions suivantes:
a) La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en tirant ses conclusions au sujet de la crédibilité?
b) La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le préjudice subi par les demandeurs ne satisfaisait pas aux critères permettant de conclure à l'existence de difficultés graves et persistantes ou n'était pas suffisamment grave pour être assimilé à de la persécution?
c) La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur ne procédant pas à une analyse en vertu de l'article 96?
d) La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en estimant que le temps que la demanderesse principale avait laissé s'écouler avant de présenter sa demande d'asile minait sa crédibilité?
e) La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte de la question de la protection de l'État?
IV.
Norme de contrôle
[12]
En présence d'une question touchant aux faits, au pouvoir discrétionnaire ou à la politique, et lorsque le droit et les faits ne peuvent être aisément dissociés, la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique généralement (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 51). En particulier, c'est cette norme qui s'applique à l'égard des conclusions tirées au sujet de la crédibilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 732, au paragraphe 14).
[13]
Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47).
V.
Analyse
A.
La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en tirant ses conclusions au sujet de la crédibilité?
[14]
Les demandeurs contestent les conclusions négatives que la Commission a tirées au sujet de leur crédibilité au motif qu'elle n'a pas tenu dûment compte des éléments de preuve dont elle disposait et qu'elle n'a pas exposé de motifs pour expliquer pourquoi elle préférait certains éléments de preuve à d'autres.
[15]
Plus précisément, les demandeurs insistent pour dire que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte de la prépondérance de la preuve en ce qui concerne le profil de la demanderesse principale qui, en tant que médecin célibataire née à l'étranger appelée à témoigner en matière criminelle devant les tribunaux, était ciblée de même que sa famille. La Commission s'est plutôt livrée à une analyse microscopique et s'est concentrée sur la déclaration que le codemandeur avait faite au point d'entrée suivant laquelle le couteau avait été laissé dans la cour alors qu'il n'était pas physiquement présent à Saint-Vincent. Le témoignage que la demanderesse principale a donné sous serment au sujet du couteau a été écarté au profit du rapport de police malgré les efforts déployés par la demanderesse principale pour s'assurer que des éléments de preuve exacts soient soumis à la Commission.
[16]
Pour sa part, le défendeur maintient que les demandeurs demandent à la Cour de procéder à une nouvelle appréciation de la preuve. La Commission a tiré deux conclusions claires au sujet de la crédibilité en ce qui concerne le rapport de police et l'affirmation inexacte faite par le codemandeur au sujet de l'emplacement du couteau. Dans ses motifs, la Commission précise sur quelle base repose sa décision puisqu'elle accepte les allégations de discrimination et de harcèlement, mais estime que, compte tenu du temps écoulé et de ses réserves en ce qui concerne la crédibilité, l'allégation de persécution n'avait pas été établie.
[17]
La Commission a l'obligation de formuler sa conclusion défavorable au sujet de la crédibilité « en des termes clairs et explicites » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF)). La Commission a satisfait à cette exigence lorsqu'elle a analysé les allégations des demandeurs en relevant une contradiction au sujet de l'emplacement du couteau et le fait que les allégations en question n'étaient pas corroborées par un rapport de police. Comme la demanderesse principale estimait qu'il s'agissait d'un incident critique qui avait précipité sa décision d'immigrer au Canada, il n'était pas déraisonnable de la part de la Commission d'insister sur cet aspect.
[18]
Contrairement à ce que prétendent les demandeurs, la Commission s'est fondée sur des éléments de preuve clairs et précis pour justifier sa conclusion, a examiné la question de la crédibilité à la lumière de l'ensemble de la preuve dont elle disposait (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), et a abordé les éléments de preuve contradictoires (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 625, au paragraphe 28).
[19]
Tout en relevant des contradictions en ce qui concerne l'incident du couteau et du chien, la Commission a également reconnu que les demandeurs avaient fait l'objet d'un certain degré de discrimination et de harcèlement à Saint-Vincent au fil des ans et qu'ils étaient atteints d'une partie ou de la totalité des symptômes décrits par la psychologue. Malgré le fait que son analyse est plutôt brève, la Commission a tenu compte de la situation personnelle et professionnelle des demandeurs.
[20]
Les raisons invoquées pour justifier les conclusions négatives tirées au sujet de la crédibilité sont suffisantes pour permettre à notre Cour de « comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal » et de déterminer si cette conclusion faisait partie des issues possibles acceptables (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACS 62, au paragraphe 16).
B.
La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le préjudice subi par les demandeurs ne satisfaisait pas aux critères permettant de conclure à l'existence de difficultés graves et persistantes ou n'était pas suffisamment grave pour être assimilé à de la persécution?
[21]
Les demandeurs affirment que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte de leurs témoignages au sujet de la persécution raciale et des autres formes de persécution. La Commission a, sans avoir procédé à l'analyse qui s'imposait, tranché la question en se contentant d'affirmer que le traitement subi par les demandeurs n'équivalait pas à un préjudice grave.
[22]
Le défendeur maintient que la Commission n'a pas ignoré le traitement subi par les demandeurs, mais a conclu que, cumulativement, les faits allégués ne pouvaient être assimilés à de la persécution. Cette conclusion démontre que la Commission était consciente des critères juridiques applicables.
[23]
Les demandeurs insistent sur la décision récente
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 468, au paragraphe 7, dans laquelle le juge Russel Zinn passe en revue la jurisprudence relative au sens du terme « persécution ». Le juge Zinn cite la définition qui a été examinée pour la première fois dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  suivant laquelle le mot « persécuter » signifie [traduction] « harceler ou tourmenter sans relâche par des traitements cruels ou vexatoires; tourmenter sans répit ». Le juge Zinn signale également que les arrêts
Canada (Procureur général) c Ward
, [1993] 2 RCS 689, [1993] 2 ACS 74, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  définissent de façon générale la persécution comme s'entendant habituellement d'une atteinte grave à un droit fondamental de la personne.
[24]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour d'appel fédérale a estimé que la discrimination dont il était question dans cette affaire n'était pas « suffisamment sérieuse ou systématiquepour être qualifiée de persécution ». Au paragraphe 3, la Cour souligne ce qui suit:
[3] Il est vrai que la ligne de démarcation entre la persécution et la discrimination ou le harcèlement est difficile à tracer, d'autant plus que, dans le contexte du droit des réfugiés, il a été conclu que la discrimination peut fort bien être considérée comme équivalant à la persécution. Il est également vrai que la question de l'existence de la persécution dans les cas de discrimination ou de harcèlement n'est pas simplement une question de fait, mais aussi une question mixte de droit et de fait, et que des notions juridiques sont en cause. Toutefois, il reste que, dans tous les cas, il incombe à la Section du statut de réfugié de tirer sa conclusion dans le contexte factuel particulier, en effectuant une analyse minutieuse de la preuve présentée et en soupesant comme il convient les divers éléments de la preuve, et que l'intervention de cette Cour n'est pas justifiée à moins que la conclusion tirée ne semble arbitraire ou déraisonnable.
[25]
Se fondant sur cet extrait de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, les demandeurs soulignent que la discrimination et le harcèlement peuvent être assimilés à de la persécution et que la Commission n'aurait pas dû écarter aussi aisément leur témoignage.
[26]
Bien que je reconnaisse que la Commission aurait pu expliquer de façon plus explicite le critère juridique qu'elle appliquait, j'estime que la conclusion à laquelle elle est arrivée était raisonnable et qu'elle est conforme à l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité.
[27]
La Commission a reconnu que les demandeurs avaient « fait l'objet d'un certain degré de discrimination et de harcèlement », mais a quand même conclu qu'il n'avait « pas été établi, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que ces formes de mauvais traitements et de violence, même prises ensemble, satisferaient au critère du préjudice grave et persistant qui équivaut à de la persécution ». La discrimination et le harcèlement subis par les demandeurs n'étaient tout simplement pas suffisamment graves et persistants pour être assimilables à de la persécution, que ces incidents soient envisagés isolément ou cumulativement. La Commission a examiné le contexte factuel et a procédé à une pondération des divers éléments de preuve qui n'était ni arbitraire ni déraisonnable.
[28]
La conclusion de la Commission est brève, mais, comme l'exige l'arrêt
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, précité, elle indique clairement le fondement de la décision. La Cour doit tenir compte du passage cité dans cette décision suivant lequel [traduction] « [i]l ne faut pas examiner les motifs dans l'abstrait; il faut examiner le résultat dans le contexte de la preuve, des arguments des parties et du processus. Il n'est pas nécessaire que les motifs soient parfaits ou exhaustifs » (au paragraphe 18).
[29]
Je conclus par conséquent que c'est de façon raisonnable que la Commission a conclu que le traitement subi par les demandeurs en l'espèce n'était pas assimilable à de la persécution.
C.
La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur ne procédant pas à une analyse en vertu de l'article 96?
[30]
Pour des motifs semblables, les demandeurs insistent pour dire que la Commission a omis de procéder à une analyse raisonnée des allégations des demandeurs en vertu de l'article 96. En tant que personnes d'origine ethnique indienne, les demandeurs font partie d'une petite minorité à Saint-Vincent et ont été victimes de discrimination raciale. La situation de la demanderesse principale, en tant que seule femme médecin célibataire de l'île, exacerbe encore plus leur sentiment de vulnérabilité et de peur.
[31]
Je suis toutefois d'accord avec le défendeur pour dire qu'il n'y a rien qui permette de penser que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte des motifs invoqués par les demandeurs à l'appui de leurs arguments fondés sur l'article 96. Au paragraphe 2 de ses motifs, la Commission prend acte du profil professionnel, sexuel et personnel de la demanderesse principale en tant qu' « Indienne aisée vivant seule et ayant fourni des témoignages d'expert dans d'autres affaires pénales en tant que médecin. »
[32]
Comme nous l'avons déjà signalé, la Commission a simplement conclu que la discrimination que les demandeurs avaient subie à Saint-Vincent n'avait pas atteint le degré exigé pour leur permettre de présenter une demande fondée sur la persécution au sens de l'article 96. Il était raisonnable de la part de la Commission d'évaluer ainsi les éléments de preuve portés à sa connaissance.
D.
La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en estimant que le temps que la demanderesse principale avait laissé s'écouler avant de présenter sa demande d'asile minait sa crédibilité?
[33]
La demanderesse principale s'oppose à la conclusion de la Commission suivant laquelle le délai qu'elle a laissé s'écouler avant de présenter sa demande d'asile a eu une incidence négative sur sa crédibilité. Elle explique qu'après être entrée au Canada comme visiteuse, elle a présenté sa demande d'asile avant l'expiration du délai de six mois. Après son arrivée au Canada, elle a continué à être préoccupée par un éventuel retour à Saint-Vincent et a tenté de s'informer des diverses options qui s'offraient aux ressortissants étrangers souhaitant immigrer. De plus, la Commission a affirmé à tort qu'en tant que médecin, elle était davantage informée et qu'elle aurait dû être au courant du processus canadien de demande d'asile alors que, dans son esprit, elle avait une perception différente des personnes pouvant être considérées comme des réfugiés.
[34]
Les arguments du défendeur m'ont toutefois convaincu que la conclusion tirée par la Commission concernant le temps que la demanderesse principale avait laissé s'écouler avant de demander l'asile était raisonnable.
[35]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour d'appel fédérale a expliqué que « le retard à formuler une demande de statut de réfugié n'est pas un facteur déterminant en soi » et qu'il s'agit d'un « élément pertinent dont le tribunal peut tenir compte pour apprécier les dires ainsi que les faits et gestes d'un revendicateur ».
[36]
La Commission a examiné l'explication fournie par la demanderesse principale pour justifier son retard à agir, mais a estimé que cette explication n'était « pas satisfaisant[e] ». Même si elle se trouvait au Canada légalement comme visiteuse à ce moment-là, on pouvait raisonnablement s'attendre à ce que la demanderesse principale présente une demande d'asile à la première occasion, et son omission de le faire mine sa crédibilité et permet de douter de sa crainte subjective (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 965, au paragraphe 15). Ainsi que le défendeur le souligne, le fait que la demanderesse principale a attendu que son visa de visiteuse soit sur le point d'expirer avant de tenter de s'informer des options qui s'offraient à elle appuie la conclusion de la Commission.
[37]
De plus, le fait que la Commission mentionne qu'en tant que médecin, la demanderesse principale était instruite, mais qu'elle n'avait pas présenté de demande d'asile plus tôt ne constitue pas une erreur. La demanderesse principale aurait peut-être préféré que la Commission accorde une plus grande importante à son argument qu'elle avait une perception différente des réfugiés lorsqu'elle a été informée pour la première fois des options qui s'offraient à elle, mais il ne s'ensuit pas pour autant que le raisonnement suivi par la Commission est nécessairement déraisonnable. Ainsi que le défendeur l'indique clairement, il appartient aux issues possibles acceptables de s'attendre à ce qu'une personne instruite et avertie qui craint pour sa vie ait une idée de ce qu'elle entend faire une fois admise au Canada.
[38]
Par conséquent, la Commission n'a pas commis d'erreur susceptible de contrôle en tenant compte du délai que la demanderesse principale a laissé s'écouler avant de présenter sa demande d'asile et en tirant une conclusion à cet égard relativement à la crédibilité de la demanderesse principale.
E.
La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en n'examinant pas la question de la protection de l'État?
[39]
Comme argument final, les demandeurs reprochent à la Commission de ne pas avoir analysé la question de la protection de l'État, compte tenu de la preuve abondante qu'ils avaient soumise à ce sujet, y compris les admissions des policiers dont a fait part la demanderesse principale. Suivant le défendeur, ces arguments ne tiennent cependant pas compte de la conclusion de la Commission suivant laquelle la demanderesse n'avait pas de crainte subjective de persécution.
[40]
Comme elle s'était prononcée sur les questions liées à la crédibilité des demandeurs en se fondant sur un incident critique et qu'elle avait conclu que la discrimination et le harcèlement dont les demandeurs avaient été victimes n'étaient pas assimilables à de la persécution, je suis d'accord pour dire qu'il n'était pas nécessaire que la Commission analyse la question de la protection de l'État, et j'estime qu'elle n'a commis aucune erreur en ne le faisant pas.
VI.
Conclusion
[41]
Malgré leur brièveté, les conclusions tirées par la Commission au sujet de la crédibilité, sa conclusion que la discrimination et le harcèlement subis par les demandeurs n'étaient pas assimilables à de la persécution, et l'analyse à laquelle elle a procédé en vertu de l'article 96 étaient toutes raisonnables. Vu ces conclusions, la Commission n'était pas tenue de procéder à une analyse de la protection de l'État.
[42]
Par conséquent, je rejette la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire.
