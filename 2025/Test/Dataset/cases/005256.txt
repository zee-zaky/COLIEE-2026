MacKay, J.
: The plaintiff seeks summary judgment pursuant to the Court's rules 432.1 et seq. in an action commenced by Statement of Claim filed January 11, 1995 to which a Defence was filed on behalf of both defendants, Deepak Kumar Stokes, now of Eureka, California who is the owner of the defendant ship, and the defendant ship WINCHESTER.
[2]
The plaintiff's claim is for costs alleged to have been incurred but which remain unpaid by the defendant owner for wharfage, security, shore power, necessary maintenance provided to the vessel and for storage of certain refrigeration equipment intended for the vessel, all supplied by the plaintiff. Shelburne Marine Limited operates a marine repair facility  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Nova Scotia. The services and supplies were provided to and for the vessel from the time she was moored at the plaintiff's wharf on June 22, 1993 until and after the time of the filing of the Statement of Claim and the simultaneous arrest of the vessel at the plaintiff's wharf, in January 1995. It is pleaded that the work was ordered by the defendant Stokes.
[3]
By its Statement of Claim the plaintiff seeks relief by judgment against the defendant in the amount of $140,560.76 together with interest at a rate determined as just by the court, and in default of payment, an Order for appraisement and sale of the defendant vessel, costs, and such other relief as the nature of the case may require. In a draft order presented by the plaintiff with the motion for summary judgment, some modification of the proposed relief appears, including a different amount, $149,758.57, for the total debt owing to January 13, 1995; with a claim for interest at the rate of 24.48% per annum commencing January 13, 1995 until judgment; and provision for the debt to be now enforced by sale of the vessel upon application by the plaintiff by ex parte motion for directions as to the sale.
[4]
The background of the claim is a story of failed or unfulfilled expectations on both sides that substantial refit and repair of the ship WINCHESTER would be undertaken at the plaintiff's repair yard. The Defence filed does not specifically deny that the services and storage referred to by the plaintiff were supplied to the vessel at the owner's request, as alleged, though a general denial of all allegations contained in the Statement of Claim is made as if they were set out and traversed seriatim. The Defence does then set out as follows:
"4. To the knowledge of the plaintiff, this defendant acquired the defendant vessel with the intention of refitting her for employment in the commercial fishery in India or elsewhere in southern Asia. In consideration of this defendant's promising to the plaintiff a right of first refusal to undertake the refit contract, the plaintiff agreed that this defendant would be permitted to moor the defendant vessel at the plaintiff's facility  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Nova Scotia, pending preparation of technical specifications for the refit contract, this defendant's securing appropriate financing with which to undertake the refit itself, and preparation for and conduct of tendering of the refit contract. Pursuant to and in reliance upon that agreement, this defendant has caused the defendant vessel to be moored at the plaintiff's said facility.
"5. The plaintiff agreed with this defendant that moorage charges with respect to the defendant vessel were to be negotiated at such time at such time [sic] as the refit contract were awarded by this defendant, which event has not occurred as at the date hereof.
"6. This defendant states that the right of the plaintiff to make claim for moorage charges has not yet accrued, by reason that the refit contract is not yet ready to be awarded and in fact has not been so awarded.
"7. In the alternative, this defendant states that the charges claimed by the plaintiff are unreasonable, excessive and not in accordance with prevailing industry standards in rural Nova Scotia (or elsewhere), and in particular have not at any time been agreed to by this defendant or by anyone on his behalf.
"8. This defendant disputes the amount of the plaintiff's claim herein, and denies that he is liable to the plaintiff in the amount which has been claimed herein."
[5]
On the pleadings, at first glance, the defendant disputes that there was any contract for the supplies and services as the plaintiff claims, and on what the terms of the contract, if any, were. On the basis of affidavits filed there are different recollections of events and perceptions of their significance. In the alternative the defendant claims the charges of the plaintiff are unreasonable and denies he is liable in the amount claimed.
[6]
A first issue requiring disposition is whether this is an appropriate case at this stage for summary judgment under the
Rules
. Resolution of this issue depends upon consideration of the
Rules
and review of the evidence provided, at this stage by affidavits filed in support of the motion, and an affidavit and cross-examination thereon of the defendant Stokes. I turn first to the
Rules
and relevant jurisprudence then to an assessment of the circumstances in this case.
The Rules Concerning Summary
Judgment And Related Jurisprudence
[7]
The court's
Rules
on summary judgment are relatively new, coming into force January 13, 1994. They provide, in part, as follows.
"432.1(1) A plaintiff may, after the defendant has filed a defence, or earlier with leave of the court, and at any time prior to the fixing of the time and date for trial, make a motion to a judge, with supporting affidavit material or other evidence, for summary judgment on all or part of the claim in the statement of claim.
. . . . .
"432.2(1) In response to affidavit material or other evidence supporting a motion for summary judgment, a responding party may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of the party's pleadings, but must set out, in affidavit material or other evidence, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
. . . . .
"432.3(1) Where a judge is satisfied that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or defence, the judge shall grant summary judgment accordingly.
"432.3(2) Where a judge is satisfied that the only genuine issue is the amount to which the moving party is entitled, the judge may order a trial of that issue or grant summary judgment with a reference to determine the amount.
"432.3(3) Where a judge is satisfied that the only genuine issue is a question of law, the judge may determine the question and grant summary judgment accordingly.
"432.3(4) Where a judge decides that there is a genuine issue with respect to a claim or defence, the judge may nevertheless grant summary judgment in favour of any party, either upon an issue or generally, unless
(a) the judge is unable on the whole of the evidence to find the facts necessary to decide the questions of fact or law; or
(b) the judge considers that it would be unjust to decide the issues on the motion for summary judgment.
"432.3(5) Where a motion for summary judgment is dismissed, either in whole or in part, a judge may order the action, or the issues in the action not disposed of by summary judgment, to proceed to trial in the usual way, but upon the request of any party, a judge may order an expedited trial under rule 327.1.
. . . . .
"432.5 Where summary judgment is refused or is granted only in part, the judge may make an order specifying what material facts are not in dispute and defining the issue to be tried, and may give such directions or impose such terms as the judge deems just, including an order
(a) for payment into court of all or part of the claim;
(b) for security for costs; and
(c) limiting the nature and scope of discovery, if any, to matters not covered by the affidavits filed on the motion for summary judgment and any cross-examination on them, and providing for the use of the affidavits and cross-examination at the trial in the same manner as an examination for discovery."
[8]
There are relatively few decisions in this court concerning these new rules. In
Old Fish Market Restaurants Ltd.
v.
1000357 Ontario Inc. et al.
(1994), 58 C.P.R.(3d) 221, at p. 222 (F.C.T.D.), the Associate Chief Justice said:
"The purpose of these provisions is to allow the court to summarily dispense with those cases which it considers ought not to proceed to trial because there is no genuine issue with respect to the claim or defence. It is a decision to be made on the particular circumstances of each case and on the law and the facts submitted in support of the claim or defence."
In that case, Jerome, A.C.J., dismissed an application for summary judgment where the defence raised a genuine issue concerning validity of the trademarks which the plaintiff sought to protect by relief against alleged infringement.
[9]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) Madame Justice Reed dismissed two motions for summary judgment, one seeking dismissal of the action as against an individual defendant in his personal capacity which motion was found not to be supported on the evidence, and the other, seeking judgment on one of several monetary claims by the plaintiff, was dismissed when it was not clearly established how that claim was interrelated with the other claims the plaintiff proposed to pursue. Her Ladyship notes in that case (at pp. 103, 105):
"In my view, rules 432.1 and following should be interpreted by reference to their own textual framework. Rule 432.3(4) provides that summary judgment should not be granted on an issue which (1) on the whole of the evidence the judge cannot find the necessary facts or (2) it would be unjust to do so. These are the criteria which must be considered ...
. . . . .
"... I do not think I can conclude that there is no genuine dispute with respect to the particular claim. Thus, this is not an appropriate situation in which to give summary judgment."
[10]
On the other hand, where he found no genuine issue for trial set out by the defendants' defence, Mr. Justice Strayer granted summary judgment pursuant to rule 432.2(1): see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).
[11]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) Mr. Justice Stone, for the Court of Appeal, allowed an appeal from an order which had allowed summary judgment on the basis that there were "no genuine issues of fact", because the conflicting evidence of the parties as to whether the owners of the vessel had ordered the necessaries as claimed presented a genuine issue of fact for trial, which fact was the essential basis for the claim in rem upon which summary judgment was sought. In regard to that issue Stone, J.A., commented, "Credibility is very much involved in that determination, which cannot be made by a motions judge or by this court" He also makes reference to cases dealing with similar rules in Ontario and comments:
"In my view the new process available under rules 432.1 - 432.7 should not be construed as to prevent a motions judge from doing that which it surely envisages - allowing a summary judgment to be rendered in a proper case with consequent savings in time and expense that a trial would otherwise entail. The intention appears to be that claims or defences clearly without foundation should not take up the time and incur the costs of a trial."
[12]
Whether there is a "genuine issue for trial" or whether "claims or defences [are] clearly without foundation [and] should not take up the time and incur the costs of a trial", in the words of Mr. Justice Stone, is a matter for determination in each case. Merely because facts may be in issue on the face of affidavits or other evidence offered to the court at this stage, does not completely resolve the issue.
[13]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.)) Mr. Justice Chilcott granted summary judgment in an action for damages for professional negligence where there was conflicting affidavit evidence on behalf of the parties about professional practice standards applicable for solicitors involved in real property transactions. Chilcott, J., dealing with plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, concluded that having taken "a hard look at the merits of the action" he was of opinion there was no genuine issue for trial as to liability or damages and he proceeded to assess damages against the defendant whom he found liable. On appeal, only the amount of damages assessed was varied while the court agreed that there was no genuine issue with respect to the solicitor's liability in the circumstances.
[14]
In that case, Mr. Justice Chilcott referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Gen. Div.) where Mr. Justice Henry reviewed the developing jurisprudence in relation to the Ontario
Rules
concerning summary judgment and set out a number of principles from "the seminal decisions of the court on rule 20", as follows, at p. 238:
"Rule 20 contemplates a radically new attitude to motions for judgment; the objective is to screen out claims that in the opinion of the court, based on evidence furnished as directed by the rule, ought not to proceed to trial because they cannot survive the 'good hard look'.
"There is no arbitrary or fixed criterion that the motions judge must apply. It is a case by case decision to be made on the law and on the facts that he is able to find on the evidence submitted to him in support of the claim or defence, whether the plaintiff has laid a proper foundation in its affidavit and other evidence to sustain the claims made.
"It is not sufficient for the responding party to say that more and better evidence will (or may) be available at trial. The occasion is now. The respondent must set out specific facts and coherent evidence organized to show that there is a genuine issue for trial.
"Apparent factual conflict in evidence does not end the inquiry.
"The court may, on a common sense basis, draw inferences from the evidence.
"The court may look at the overall credibility of the plaintiff's action, i.e., does the plaintiff's case have the ring of truth about it such that it would justify consideration by the trier of fact?
"Matters of credibility requiring resolution in a case of conflicting evidence ought to go to trial; however, that depends upon the circumstances of the case; the court in taking the 'hard look' at the merits must decide if any conflict is more apparent than real, i.e., whether there is really an issue of credibility that must be resolved in order to adjudicate on the merits."
The Circumstances In This Case
[15]
The evidence of the plaintiff by affidavit of Brian Flemming, Chairman and President of the Shelburne Marine and Wayne Livingstone, General Manager of the company's operations, is that the latter was initially contacted in February 1993 by the defendant Stokes, who advised that he was arranging to purchase the MV Winchester which would require extensive refit for conversion from a wet fish trawler to a freezer processing trawler for use in tropical waters off the coast of India. In March at the request of Stokes, Livingstone met with Stokes' representatives in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, where they viewed the Winchester. Both parties were aware at the time that the plans of Stokes to refit the vessel were dependant upon his ability to arrange financing for the project.
[16]
Livingstone's evidence is that he then informed Stokes that if the Winchester was to be moored  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Marine's yard there would be fees payable for wharfage and charges for shore power, security services and any necessary maintenance required on the vessel. Further, Stokes was informed that if the refit work was carried out by the plaintiff on the scale initially outlined by Stokes, which was estimated in July 1993 by Shelburne Marine on a preliminary basis, without detailed plans, to be in an amount in excess of $1.5 million, then there would likely be a reduction in wharfage charges but that costs of security services, shore power, and any essential maintenance would have to be paid by Stokes in any event. Thereafter Stokes advised the vessel would be moved, to be moored  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Marine's yard. She was so moved on June 22, 1993 and on arrival representatives of Stokes requested that shore power and security be provided to the Winchester.
[17]
The arrangements, said by Livingstone to have been set out in advance were not reduced to writing until a later date, after the Winchester had been moored at the plaintiff's facilities for some months with little or no progress made in the arrangements for financing the refit, or in arranging for the work to be done.
[18]
Mr. Flemming's evidence in part is:
"7. THAT to complement and facilitate its business as a repair facility, the established practice of Shelburne Marine is to charge wharfage fees based on the economic benefit that the particular vessel brings to the yard. If, for instance, a vessel requires a large amount of work, Shelburne Marine will often provide a substantial reduction in wharfage fees in exchange for the benefits involved in performing the work on the vessel.
. . . . .
"9. THAT I am informed by Wayne Livingstone ('Livingstone'), vice president and general manager of Shelburne Marine, and do verily believe, that well in advance of the arrival of the Winchester at the Shelburne Marine yard, Livingstone advised the defendant Stokes that the fees associated with wharfage of the Winchester would be $128 per day. I am further informed by Livingstone, and do verily believe, that at the same time he advised the defendant Stokes that the charge for the provision of shore power would be $13.16 per day and that the charge for the provision of security services would be $63 per day.
"10. THAT I am advised by Livingstone, and do verily believe, that well in advance of the arrival of the Winchester at the Shelburne Marine yard, Livingstone clearly explained to the defendant Stokes Shelburne Marine's practice (as outlined above in paragraph seven) of charging wharfage fees based on the amount of eventual work completed by Shelburne Marine, and that the full charges for provision of shore power and security services would have to be paid by the defendant Stokes in any event.
"11. THAT Shelburne Marine has charged similar per diem rates to other vessels docked at the Shelburne Marine yard and these amounts have been paid by the owners of those vessels."
[19]
There was correspondence between the parties after the vessel's arrival  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . I summarize that insofar as it was concerned with the general arrangements between the parties, and in particular the arrangements for services for the vessel. In July the plaintiff sent a preliminary estimate of total costs anticipated for the refit work, without the benefit of any detailed plans. In September 1993 Flemming wrote to Stokes noting the vessel had been moored  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for up to four months and refrigeration equipment for the vessel had been stored by the plaintiff for longer, and indicating that the work could be expected to take up to 14 weeks if it were possible to commence by November 1.
[20]
On November 15, 1993 Flemming again wrote to Stokes and for the first time made reference to services provided to the ship. The letter emphasized the plaintiff's continuing interest in the work proposed for which, apparently, bids had been invited, and it then stated:
"I expect Mr. Ward also told you that we believe that we have a unique position in the bidding process because of our assistance to you and your company, our storage of your refrigeration equipment for many months, our wharfing and security services for the ship, our supplying power and heat to the ship when needed and the use of our offices for various meetings.
"Most times, our practice is to render monthly accounts for these various services. Normally, our wharfing and storage charges are based on a sliding scale which depends on the amount of work which we receive from a customer: the more work, the lower the charge; if work is substantial, there is frequently no charge for wharfing and storage, only for out of pocket expenses.
"When you make your decision on which company is to convert the 'WINCHESTER', we would like you to have before you our figures on our normal charges so that these numbers can be taken into account as you make your decision. We are, of course, hoping that these numbers plus our general help thoughout [sic] the project will give us a 'competitive advantage' over other yards. In what we hope will be the unlikely event that we are not awarded the job we would expect that our normal charges would be paid before the ship and the stored refrigeration equipment left our premises."
[21]
On December 20, 1993 Flemming wrote again after learning that the proposed work would be further delayed. With the work delayed, and no contact let, he advised Stokes that he was enclosing an invoice for services rendered to the vessel up to November 30, and that thereafter an invoice would be sent on a monthly basis with a usual 1% discount for payment in 10 days, a period extended to January 10, 1994 in the case of the first invoice. That account, for service to the M.V. Winchester from June 22 to November 30, 1993 was in an amount of $55,285.76, payable on receipt with interest stated to be at "2 percent per month, compounded monthly (24.48% per annum)".
[22]
On January 5, 1994 Stokes responded to Flemming and for the first time set out the oral agreement he says was made with Livingstone before the Winchester was moved to the plaintiff's yard. He describes the arrangement in the following terms:
"The agreement was that Shelburne Marine, would have the first right of refusal to the conversion work on the WINCHESTER contingent upon all the following conditions:
1. Shelburne Marine had the lowest bid to perform the conversion work. If Shelburne Marine did not have the lowest bid, then Shelburne Marine would be given the opportunity to modify their bid.
2. The work proceeding on the WINCHESTER would be contingent upon financing the conversion work through the Canadian Export Development Authority. For this to occur, CEDA would require proof of fishing permits for the Indian EEZ. Mr. Fleming had stated that financial guaranties by the Government of India was [sic] not required.
3. Shelburne Marine would not charge any storage fees for the refrigeration equipment and for tieing up the WINCHESTER at the Shelburne Marine Yard."
In this letter Stokes also expressed surprise at the invoices sent to him in December which he considered arbitrary and capricious. He then added "Should Shelburne Marine no longer be interested in performing the work, we would be glad to pay you reasonable costs for mooring the WINCHESTER and storage of the refrigeration equipment".
[23]
On January 27, 1994 Stokes wrote to Livingstone describing the arrangements somewhat differently:
"At this time we are concerned about our agreement on the dockage of F/V WINCHESTER and storage of the refrigeration equipment at your shipyard. You and I had a verbal agreement over the phone that your shipyard would not charge any moorage or storage fees, and in return you would be given the first right of refusal to do the refit work on the boat, provided you were the lowest bidder or were given the right to resubmit your bid if it wasn't the lowest bid and also provided we got the financing through the Canadian government. Mr. Brian Flemming had indicated that he could get us the financing through EDC. Wayne you had confirmed that this was our original verbal agreement when we had talked over the phone a couple of weeks ago.
"My concern at this stage is what happens if the financing does not go through? We originally were going to put the refrigeration equipment on the boat and moor the boat at a government dock. In all fairness to both parties I think North American Fish Company should pay the same fee to Shelburne Marine as we would have payed the Canadian government. We should not have to pay for the storage of the refrigeration equipment since we would have stored it on the boat. We are willing to pay Shelburne Marine c$750 a month, beginning July 1st, 1993. This will be credited to us should the financing come through
"Should this be satisfactory to you, please confirm in writing to North American Fish Company, otherwise we will be moving the boat to a government dock. Please discuss this Mr. Brian Flemming, President, Shelburne Marine."
[24]
On February 1, 1994 Flemming wrote to Stokes expressing discouragement at lack of progress on the refit project, and in the course of that letter he did say:
"There is no doubt ... that if we get the work on the 'WINCHESTER' at the levels at which we have been talking then there will be no charge whatsoever for the wharfage, storage, security, power etc. We make this arrangement from time to time with customers and only once has it caused a disagreement with the customer ... I very much appreciate the offer of payment contained in your last FAX ..."
However, on March 31, 1994 Flemming again wrote to Stokes, a long letter with a metaphorical story to illustrate the plaintiff's dilemma. He enclosed invoices for January and February, which appear to be the first setting out per diem charges: for wharfage at $128/day; for shore power at $13.16/day; for security at $100/day; and for storage at $75/day. These invoices include reference to terms including interest at 2% per month compounded monthly (24.48% per annum).
[25]
On April 4, 1994 Stokes responded to Flemming, affirming the oral agreement he had made with Livingstone in the following terms:
"... our oral agreement had been that I should bring the vessel to Shelburne Marine Yard and that there would be no dockage fee for F/V Winchester nor any storage fee for the refrigeration equipment ... We had agreed that should the dockage space be required for another vessel we would move our vessel to a government dock. I originally planned to store the refrigeration equipment on the vessel but on Mr. Livingston's suggestion kept it in your yard. He had stated that the space was not being utilized.
"Mr. Livingston and I had agreed that should there be any direct expenses then after mutual agreement the work would be done and we would pay for it. ...
"In return for the above service Mr. Livingston and we had agreed to give Shelburne Marine Ltd. the first right of refusal to do the work and if its bid was not the lowest it would have the chance to resubmit its bid."
Stokes also reaffirmed willingness to pay the plaintiff at the rate of $750 per month from July 1, 1993 which would be credited to the defendant when financing was secured. If that arrangement were not acceptable the defendant would move the vessel to a government dock.
[26]
On May 26, 1994 Flemming wrote to Stokes apparently anticipating a call from the latter to discuss the first part of the work on the vessel. On June 6, 1994 Livingstone wrote to Stokes indicating that if the plaintiff were to get the contract to do the work, the defendant's outstanding account for services would be credited with amounts of 5% of the total phase contract values, to be credited in relation to wharfage and storage fees assessed. On commencement of the first phase only charges for shore power and security would continue.
[27]
On September 2, 1994 Livingstone wrote to Stokes advising that the plaintiff's interest in the project was ended, that the defendant should pay all outstanding accounts as invoiced and remove the vessel and equipment from the plaintiff's yard. Otherwise the plaintiff would take action to secure its rights against the defendant's property, with legal proceedings to be initiated on September 12 if outstanding accounts were not then paid.
[28]
In January the plaintiff initiated this action and arrested the ship, which remains moored at the plaintiff's yard  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[29]
The plaintiff's evidence of the contract between the parties for services supplied to the vessel at the defendant Stoke's request is clear: that from June 22, 1993 services were to be provided at the per diem rates generally assessed by the plaintiff, subject to reduction or write off of charges for wharfage depending upon the value of refit work contracted with the plaintiff, but with no reduction in charges for shore power, security or necessary maintenance. No refit work was contracted and the plaintiff's claim is for the full value of services invoiced to the defendant together with interest as provided on the invoices. I note that on those invoices the charges for security are stated as $100 per day.
[30]
The defendant's evidence of the arrangements is very different. As outlined in his letter of January 5, 1994 he considered it an agreement whereby the plaintiff would have a first right of refusal, contingent upon all of three conditions, at least two of which were not fulfilled. The plaintiff argues that literally construed this would mean there was no agreement between the parties. By later correspondence, by his affidavit and on cross-examination Stokes sets out that the agreement between the parties, made by telephone with Livingstone, which the latter denies, were that the vessel would be berthed at the plaintiff's yard without charge, provided the plaintiff had a right of first refusal on any contract for refit of the vessel. That is subsequently qualified by the provision that the plaintiff's right of refusal was a right to the job if Shelburne Marine's bid was the lowest and if not the plaintiff would be given an opportunity to submit a lower bid. At the hearing counsel for the defendant urged that the evidence could support a finding of an agreement by the plaintiff to provide free wharfage and services on speculation that by so doing it would ultimately obtain the contract for refit of the vessel.
[31]
Counsel for the defendant urges that in light of the different views there are genuine issues for trial concerning the terms of the agreement, if any, and those in turn depend upon findings of credibility, a matter not assessable on a motion for summary judgment.
[32]
In my opinion, there is no genuine issue concerning credibility in regard to the issue of liability when consideration is given to the general credibility of the claim and the defence. In retrospect it seems both parties might have served their respective interests by an exchange of correspondence setting out in writing the basic terms for services to be provided to the vessel pending negotiation of a contract for the refit project, but nevertheless both parties in my opinion can be presumed to have acted in accord with normal business and commercial relations. In my opinion, the contract arrangements underlying the claim of the plaintiff are consistent with typical business practice. On the other hand, I do not accept Stokes' evidence of the arrangements, essentially that there would be no charge for services provided to the vessel either at any time, or prior to his negotiation of a contract with the plaintiff for the refit project which negotiation had not yet occurred. That latter view of the arrangements simply is not credible in my opinion.
[33]
Stokes knew from discussions with the plaintiff's Livingstone before the vessel was moved to Shelburne what the general policy of the company was in relation to wharfage charges and charges for shore power and security and I am prepared to accept that. Stokes also knew from Flemming's letter of November 15, 1993 what the company's regular policy and charges were. He was billed for those with accounts forwarded with Flemming's letter of December 20, 1993 and by monthly invoices sent from early in 1994. Stokes implicitly recognized some liability for the services, offering twice to pay at a rate of $750 per month from July 1, 1993. If this were not acceptable he threatened to move the vessel, in January and in April, and in his letter of January 4, 1994 to Flemming he stated if the plaintiff were no longer interested in the project then reasonable costs for wharfage and for storage of equipment would be paid. Finally, Stokes continued to receive the benefit of the services provided to the vessel long after he could claim ignorance of the plaintiff's reliance on contract arrangements to pay for the services. Whether there was ever a bilateral contract between the parties, it is clear in my opinion that there was a unilateral contract with the plaintiff providing services to the vessel at the request made by Stokes or on his behalf when he was aware of the general terms on which those services would be provided. Having then had the benefit of the services he cannot avoid liability to pay for them. See generally,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) per Rouleau, J., affirmed on appeal, (1995), A-25-94 (F.C.A.).
[34]
If there is no genuine issue for trial on the question of liability, as I find is the case, the same cannot be said about the measure of debt or damages owed by the defendant. It is true that the plaintiff sent to the defendant Stokes invoices for services rendered on account of the vessel for the period of June 22, 1993 to January 11, 1995. The total of those invoices is said variously to be $140,560.76 in the plaintiff's statement of claim, to be $149,758.57 including interest in the affidavit of Flemming, and $146,896.73 in the affidavit of Skinner, the controller of the plaintiff company, as the total of invoices provided up to January 31, 1995 concerning the debt owing at January 13. That last figure is the amount included in the plaintiff's request for relief in its memorandum of fact and law. Whatever the total of the amount invoiced, the evidence does not permit a finding in regard to three aspects of the plaintiff's claim, the charges for storage of equipment, charges for security, and interest claimed.
[35]
As appears on individual invoices, part of the total is made up of charges for storage, of refrigeration equipment, at the plaintiff's premises at a rate of $75 per day. It is not clear from the affidavit evidence provided, when the charges for storage were initiated. It appears that the equipment was stored by the plaintiff for a period longer than the vessel was moored at the yard. No reference to charges for storage is made in the affidavits of Livingstone and Stokes about the arrangements originally made for services to the vessel. On the record before me those charges first appear as an item in the invoices forwarded to Stokes for January and February, 1994 by Flemming's letter of March 31, 1994. The evidence before me does not warrant a finding that the plaintiff is entitled to recover storage charges at the rate invoiced, but it is entitled to recover charges for that storage at a reasonable commercial rate, say the lesser of $75 per day and any charge for commercial storage of similar equipment elsewhere  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , or along the south shore of Nova Scotia, plus costs of removal to, and retrieval from, storage of the equipment.
[36]
Security charges appear from the affidavit of Flemming as advised to Stokes in advance of the vessel berthing  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as $63 per day. In later detailed invoices these charges are $100 per day. Livingstone, who made initial arrangements with Stokes does not specify in his affidavit what those arrangements provided for in the amounts of particular charges. I accept Flemming's affidavit specifying the rate initially fixed in the amount of $63 per day for security; later this was increased to $100 per day, an amount that should not be effective as against Stokes, absent any evidence of a promise on his part to pay, until 60 days after the first notification to him of an increase in the security charges.
[37]
Finally, on the matter of interest, the plaintiff claims interest by its statement of claim on the total account then outstanding at such rate as to the court seems just; by the affidavit of Flemming interest is claimed at the rate of 2% per month as set out in invoices sent to Stokes, and that rate is also specified in the affidavit of Skinner, the plaintiff's controller. Finally interest at the rate of 24.48% per annum on the balance outstanding as of January 13, 1995 until the date of judgment is requested, as part of the relief sought, in the plaintiff's written submissions on the motion. The last rate is equivalent, so the invoices indicate, to a rate of 2% per month compounded monthly.
[38]
There is no evidence of any agreement, express or implied, with regard to a particular interest rate. A rate at 2% per month or 24.48% per annum would be unconscionable for the court to impose, in my view. The appropriate rate would be that prevailing from time to time both as to pre-judgment and post-judgment interest under the rules and practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in accord with ss. 36 and 37 of the
Federal Court Act
.
[39]
In my view all of the matters awaiting determination relating to the plaintiff's claim concern only the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled. Those matters can best be determined by a referee at this stage, with the least delay to the parties. In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, where I find the only genuine issue concerns the amount owed by the defendant Stokes to the plaintiff on account of services provided to the defendant ship, the interests of justice, and in my view the interests of the parties, are served by summary judgment on the question of liability with a reference to determine the amount to be paid, as provided by rule 432.3(2).
[40]
For the reasons set out, the plaintiff's application for summary judgment is allowed in part and the defendant is adjudged in default and liable for payment to the plaintiff of all reasonable charges for services provided for the M.V. WINCHESTER at the plaintiff's marine yard  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[41]
The amount owing to the plaintiff, and interest thereon, unless the parties can agree on an amount within 30 days of the judgment herein, will be determined by a Referee to be appointed by the Administrator of the court upon application which may be made without delay by either of the parties. The Referee's determination shall be made as directed by the Order in terms consistent with these Reasons.
[42]
The Order also provides, as the plaintiff requests, that when the amount owed by the defendant is determined the plaintiff shall be at liberty to move, ex parte, for confirmation of that amount by judgment and for directions as to form and manner of the sale of the defendant vessel, with sale proceeds, subject to any priorities of other creditors as may be established, to be paid to the plaintiff to satisfy any debt then owed to the plaintiff by the defendant Stokes.
[43]
The plaintiff is entitled to costs of the action to date and to costs of any proceedings of the Referee.
Application allowed in part.
