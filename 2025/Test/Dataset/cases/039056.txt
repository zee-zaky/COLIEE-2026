Introduction
[1]
Hugessen, J.
: This is a motion brought by certain persons who have filed claims to entitlement in the proceeds of the judgment of this court rendered herein March 2, 1998, to have that judgment set aside in accordance with the provisions of rule 399.
Background
[2]
The case has a long and involved history. I shall attempt to set out here in summary form only such highlights as are essential to an understanding of the present Reasons.
[3]
The action was brought in September 1978, by the then chiefs of the Blueberry and Doig River Bands against the Crown for breach of fiduciary duty in respect of IR172 which had been set aside for the Beaver Band to which the Blueberry and Doig Bands were the successors. The action was brought on behalf of the members of the two Bands as well as of the "present descendants" of the former Band. The action was ultimately successful in the Supreme Court of Canada which in December 1995 remitted the matter to this court for the assessment of damages [see 190 N.R. 89].
[4]
The plaintiffs and the defendant negotiated a settlement of the damage claim in a total amount of $147 million. The settlement was approved and incorporated into a judgment of this court delivered 2 March 1998. The judgment ordered the payment of $147 million to the Bands but directed that $12 million beheld in trust pending determination of the question of the entitlement, if any, of persons who are not members of the two successor Bands but are "present descendants" of the former Beaver Band.
[5]
Provision was made for the publication of notices to such persons and a procedure established for the determination of their claims. It was specifically ordered that the question of entitlement of such persons remained open. Some 490 persons filed claims as "present descendants". The plaintiffs then moved under rule 220 for the preliminary determination of the question of law, namely whether any claimants who were "present descendants" but not members of the Blueberry or Doig Bands had any entitlement. After a two day hearing in which counsel for the claimants argued, inter alia, that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada was res judicata in their favour on that question, the court, on April 7, 1999 found against the claimants and declared that "present descendants" who were not now members of the Bands had no entitlement [see 171 F.T.R. 91]. That Order has been appealed to the Court of Appeal. The motion presently before me attacks not the April 1999 Order, but the earlier judgment of March 19998, which approved the settlement and under which the claimants have filed claims.
The Motion
[6]
As indicated, the motion is based on rule 399. That rule reads as follows:
"399(1) On motion, the court may set aside or vary an order that was made
(a) ex parte; or
(b) in the absence of a party who failed to appear by accident or mistake or by reason of insufficient notice of the proceeding, if the party against whom the order is made discloses a prima facie case why the order should not have been made.
"(2) On motion, the court may set aside or vary an order
(a) by reason of a matter that arose or was discovered subsequent to the making of the order; or
(b) where the order was obtained by fraud.
"(3) Unless the court orders otherwise, the setting aside or variance of an order under subsection (1) or (2) does not affect the validity or character of anything done or not done before the order was set aside or varied."
"399(1) La cour peut, sur requête, annuler ou modifier l'une des ordonnances suivantes, si la partie contre laquelle elle a été rendue présente une preuve prima facie démontrant pourquoi elle n'aurait pas dû être rendue:
(a) toute ordonnance rendue sur requête ex parte;
(b) toute ordonnance rendue en 'absence d'une partie qui n'a pas comparu par suite d'un événement fortuit ou d'une erreur ou à cause d'un avis insuffisant de l'instance.
"(2) La cour peut, sur requête, annuler ou modifier une ordonnance dans l'un ou l'autre des cas suivants:
(a) des faits nouveaux sont survenus ou ont été découverts après que l'ordonnance a été rendue;
(b) l'ordonnance a été obtenue par fraude.
"(3) Sauf ordonnance contraire de a cour, l'annulation ou la modification d'une ordonnance en vertu des paragraphes (1) ou (2) ne porte pas atteinte à la valadité ou à la nature des actes ou omissions antérieurs à cette annulation ou modification."
I shall deal with each of the grounds raised.
Ex Parte
[7]
The claimants argue that the Order of March 1998 was made ex parte because, they say, they were not present or represented at the hearing that led to that Order, nor did they have notice of it. This is arrant nonsense. While claiming under the judgment they seek to set it aside; they both approbate and reprobate. If they were not represented at that hearing they were equally not represented at the time the Statement of Claim was issued, nor at the time the Supreme Court pronounced judgment in their favour. If they have not been represented throughout these proceedings by the named plaintiffs and the latter's counsel, they are not and have never been parties to this action and can claim no benefit of the judgment. The simple fact is that the claimants are parties, and have been represented from the beginning by the plaintiffs and by the latter's very competent counsel. The real gravamen of their complaint is that they don't like the result of what was done prior to and since March 1998. That is a very different matter and cannot be said by any stretch of the imagination to have made those proceedings ex parte.
Fraud
[8]
The claimants then say that the March 1998 Order was obtained by fraud. By this they mean "equitable fraud" in that, they say, counsel for the plaintiffs did not fairly represent their interests when the latter turned out to be adverse to or at least different from those of the named plaintiffs. Claimants do not assert that counsel did other than a splendid job in obtaining a favourable judgment from the Supreme Court of Canada and concede that he subsequently negotiated a very good settlement for the amount of the damages. But, they say, he should not have invited the court to draw distinctions between two cases of plaintiffs which have now resulted in an outcome which is unfavourable to them.
[9]
I disagree. It is difficult to know how counsel could have acted other than he did. Up to and including the negotiation of the final settlement amount he had represented the claimants fairly and well. At that point it had become apparent to counsel that the ambiguity in the description of the class of represented plaintiffs (which, be it said, was not of his doing) had created a conflict of interest between those who were instructing him and some of those whom they represented. He then laid before the court, in the fullest and fairest manner, all the facts that were then known about the class of "present descendants". The claimants admit this to be the case, and I confirm it.
[10]
It then fell to the court to craft, with the help of both counsel, an Order that would allow the plaintiffs to have the benefit of their 20 years of litigation, protect whatever rights the claimants might arguably have, and provide a method of notifying the "present descendants" and inviting them to come before the court and make out their claims. That has now been done, those claims have been found to be invalid, and have been dismissed. Even if an appeal of that Order is successful and the claimants are found to have some sort of individual right against the collective or communal asset which is the judgment proceeds, that right is secured by a very substantial sum of money which is being held in trust. If the claimants thought that the sum was not great enough they have kept that thought to themselves and at no time have they moved to have it increased. I accordingly find that the facts simply do not support any kind of claim of equitable fraud.
[11]
Before leaving this subject, I may say that I have considerable doubt that rule 399 was ever intended to cover anything but fraud in the traditional sense of dishonest or deceitful dealing committed upon the court or upon an adversary. In the light of the finding I have just made, however, it is not necessary to express any final opinion on this question.
New Matter
[12]
The claimants also assert that they are entitled to have the judgment set aside by reason of "new matter" supervening since March 1998. That "matter" is said to be the fact that whereas in the material placed before the court at that time it was suggested in the evidence of an anthropologist that there were at best about 39 persons in the class of "present descendants", there have now been some 490 claims filed. There are two answers to that argument. In the first place, there is nothing to indicate that any of those 490 claims are valid and all of them which are based on the claimants being "present descendants" but not present members have now been dismissed as invalid. Secondly, if the mere number of claims is material to anything it is solely to the amount of the security which was ordered to be held in trust. The proper remedy for that was surely for the claimants to move to vary that amount and not to set aside the whole of the Order, thereby throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
Delay
[13]
Overarching all of the above considerations is the question of the wholly unconscionable delay by the claimants in bringing the present motion. On any reading of the uncontested facts, the claimants have had actual knowledge of all the facts that they now rely upon (I shall deal later with the one alleged exception) since at least June 1998. This motion was filed September 20, 1999. That is a delay of over 14 months.
[14]
It is of course the case that rule 399 does not fix any time limit for bringing a motion of this sort. That is because the circumstances which can give rise to such a motion are so varied and so fact-dependant that it was thought wiser and fairer to leave some latitude for judicial discretion and appreciation. But that is not to say that rule 399 establishes an endless open season for attacks upon judgments. Quite the contrary. The public interest in the stability and finality of the judicial process, an interest which is reflected in other provisions in the Statutes and the rules which set strict and short time limits for the filing of an appeal and in the injunction of rule 3 to seek expeditious solutions to problems of interpretation, all lend weight to the case law which holds that motions of this sort must be brought with reasonable diligence. [see footnote 1] One might also refer by analogy to the great body of jurisprudence imposing the same constraint on motions to lead new evidence in appeal. [see footnote 2] The time taken by these claimants is far beyond anything approaching reasonable.
[15]
The claimants, however, say that one new fact came to their knowledge only in April 1999, with the release of the Court's Reasons supporting the Answer to the Question of Law. Then only, they say, did they learn that the Order of March 1998 would have the effect of res judicata on their argument that their entitlement to a share of the judgment proceeds had been settled by the Supreme Court of Canada. Even if the claimants were right the delay of over five months in bringing this motion would be fatal.
[16]
But they are not right. The question of res judicata is not a new fact. It is not a fact at all. It is, right or wrong, an argument based on the wording of the March 1998 order and was there for anybody to see from the date of that Order. Of course the claimants do not agree with that argument and if they are right they will no doubt find that out in due course and succeed in having the April 1999 Order reversed on that ground. But if they are wrong they have simply been mistaken as to the law, and that has never been a ground for having a judgment set aside.
[17]
The claimants also invoke the authority of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  limitation period for a motion to set aside a judgment that was "wrong" because not supportable on the pleadings. With respect, I find it very hard to understand this decision and impossible to reconcile it with the case law on our rule 399 and its predecessor. Of course any judgment which a court decides to set aside is "wrong" else it would not be set aside. And the ground invoked, incompatibility with the pleadings, seems to me to be one that might, depending on the circumstances, fit into several of the rubrics of rule 399. The court does not even mention the question of the importance of maintaining stability of judgments. In my view the case, if it is to be followed at all, must be restricted to its own particular facts.
Conclusion - Costs
[18]
For all the foregoing reasons I conclude that the Motion must be dismissed. The plaintiffs have asked for costs. At previous stages I have not ordered costs since I felt that potential claimants, even if proved wrong, should not be penalized for responding to the court's invitation to present their claims. This motion is another matter, however. The claimants have had their answer from the court and now seek to attack, long out of time, the judgment which is the very reason they were given notice and invited to submit their claims in the first place. Their written materials also contain a veiled suggestion of misconduct on the part of plaintiffs' counsel (which, I should add, claimants' counsel graciously and unreservedly negated at the hearing). The motion was also filed at the last possible moment to alow it to be heard at the sittings scheduled for Edmonton on September 24, 1999. All these facts must have imposed a considerable strain on plaintiffs' counsel who nonetheless managed to file in timely manner lengthy written submissions and authorities. (They also imposed a burden on the court, but that is not important). In my view plaintiffs are entitled to their costs of the motion which I fix in the sum of $5,000.
Motion dismissed.
