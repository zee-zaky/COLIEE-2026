I.
Nature of the Matters and Background
[1]
Boswell, J.
: Pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the
Act
], Mr. Evans [the Applicant] applies for judicial review of two decisions by the same immigration officer [the Officer]: one, denying his application for permanent residence because he was inadmissible and refusing to grant the exemptions requested by the Applicant under subsection 25(1) of the
Act
; and the other, refusing to issue him a temporary resident permit [TRP] under subsection 24(1) of the
Act
. These two applications for judicial review were heard together pursuant to the orders of the Court dated October 15, 2014, granting leave to apply for judicial review.
[2]
The Applicant asks the Court to set aside both decisions and return these matters to a different officer for re-determination. These reasons for judgment determine both applications for judicial review. Accordingly, I direct that a copy of this judgment and reasons be placed in each of Court files IMM-2916-13 & IMM-2918-13.
[3]
The Applicant is a 35 year-old citizen of Saint Lucia who entered Canada on October 5, 2003. In September, 2010, after his refugee claim was denied and his application for a pre-removal risk assessment was refused, the Applicant attempted to regularize his status by applying for permanent residence as a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class.
[4]
However, on December 18, 2012, the Applicant was convicted of trafficking in cocaine and of obstructing a peace officer. The Officer sent him a letter two days later, advising that his application may have to be refused as it appeared that he was inadmissible to Canada under paragraphs 36(1)(a) and 36(2)(a) of the
Act
. The Applicant responded by a letter dated January 31, 2013, wherein he accepted that he was inadmissible but claimed that there were humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds to let him stay in Canada. He asked for either a TRP or an exemption from the provisions of the
Act
that rendered him inadmissible.
II.
The Decisions under Review
A.
The Spousal Sponsorship Decision [the Sponsorship Decision]
[5]
By letter dated April 9, 2013, the Officer refused the application for permanent residence, finding that the conviction for trafficking rendered the Applicant inadmissible for serious criminality under paragraph 36(1)(a) of the
Act
, and that the conviction for obstruction of a peace officer made him inadmissible for ordinary criminality under paragraph 36(2)(a) of the
Act
.
[6]
Although the Officer accepted that the Applicant's relationship with his sponsor was genuine, she concluded that the H&C grounds cited by the Applicant were insufficient to overcome his inadmissibility. With respect to establishment, the Officer noted that the Applicant had been continuously employed as a barber in Saint Lucia for four years before coming to Canada, and so rejected his submission that he would not be able to find a job if he was deported to Saint Lucia.
[7]
The Officer recognized that the Applicant had four minor children whose interests were affected: Misha and Inika, who were born in Saint Lucia and still live there; Malachi, who was born in Canada but returned to Saint Lucia with his mother when she was removed from Canada; and Amai, who was born in Canada and who is the daughter of the Applicant and the partner who is trying to sponsor him. The sponsor also has two other daughters who view the Applicant as their father.
[8]
The Applicant had argued that his children in Saint Lucia would be disadvantaged by his removal and consequent loss of income. However, the Applicant supplied insufficient proof that he supported those children financially, and the Officer was not satisfied that he would be unemployed in Saint Lucia. As for Malachi, the Officer noted that he has a language disorder that requires a speech therapist. A medical letter submitted by the Applicant stated there were no permanent speech therapists in Saint Lucia and an appropriate school is difficult to find, but the Officer found that this letter did not say whether there were any temporary therapists or that a school would be impossible to find. As there was no other evidence on this issue, the Officer said that she could not determine what resources were available to Malachi in Saint Lucia. Moreover, the Applicant had not explained the reason why Malachi's mother was removed or whether there was any possibility that she could return to Canada.
[9]
The Officer did consider the impact of the Applicant's removal on Amai to be a significant and compelling positive factor, but noted nonetheless that there was little information to show that the Applicant could neither support her financially from Saint Lucia nor bring her with him if he is removed. The Applicant's removal would also negatively affect his partner, but the Officer noted that she was at least partially aware that the Applicant had no status when she began a relationship with him. There was also no proof that she could not visit him in Saint Lucia.
[10]
The Officer also accepted that his partner's other two children, Cheyelle (now 22 years old) and Chamaul (now 19 years old), both view the Applicant as their father. However, there was no reason to believe that he supported them financially or that he could not maintain a relationship with them if he was removed.
[11]
Finally, the Officer weighed the positive factors against the gravity of the crime and the court's decision to confine him to his residence for six months as punishment. These were his first convictions, but the Officer noted that the Applicant had been charged with crimes before. Despite expressing remorse and an intention to improve, the Applicant had not attended any rehabilitation program. Ultimately, the Officer decided that the hardships in this case were not unusual and undeserved or disproportionate, and added that "the gravity of the PA's [Applicant's] crime does
not
outweigh the positive factors" (emphasis added).
B.
Temporary Resident Permit Decision [the TRP Decision]
[12]
In separate reasons also dated April 9, 2013, the Officer refused to issue a TRP to the Applicant (although the letter communicating this decision to him is incorrectly dated October 3, 2012). In refusing the TRP, the Officer gave essentially the same reasons with respect to the H&C considerations as she did in the Sponsorship Decision.
[13]
The only significant difference in this decision was in how the Officer treated the circumstances surrounding the Applicant's convictions. To her earlier observations, the Officer added that the fact that the Applicant served his sentence in the community was a positive factor insofar as it showed that the court did not consider the Applicant to be a danger to society. Nevertheless, the Officer noted that the Applicant's conduct was still tightly restricted by the court and that his alleged interest in rehabilitation programs seemed self-serving. Similar to the Sponsorship Decision, the Officer concluded that "the grave nature of the PA's [Applicant's] crime does
not
outweigh the humanitarian and compassionate factors put forth by the PA. He has not provided sufficient evidence of his remorse nor that he will not reoffend" (emphasis added).
III.
The Parties' Arguments
A.
The Applicant's Arguments
[14]
The Applicant argues that the Officer failed to consider probative evidence when rendering her decision on his establishment in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) at para 17, 157 FTR 35 (TD)). The Applicant says that the Officer's decision was unreasonable because it failed to properly consider his evidence that he had to abandon his barbershop in Saint Lucia because of threats from drug dealers. Furthermore, he says that the Officer ignored the high rate of unemployment in Saint Lucia as evidenced by the fact that his brothers had been unemployed in Saint Lucia ever since they returned, and failed to properly consider other indicia of establishment such as the family support that he has in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 261.
[15]
As to the best interests of the children, the Applicant says the Officer's finding was ambiguous since she said that he did not financially support his family and yet found there was no evidence he could not
continue
to support his family from Saint Lucia. As for Malachi, the Applicant says that the Officer drew unwarranted inferences from the doctor's letter, and that there was no basis for the Officer to find that Malachi's mother might be able to return to Canada.
[16]
The Applicant also contends that the Officer did not fulfill her duty to explain her findings about the gravity of his crime in clear and unmistakable terms (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (2d) 199 (CA)). The Applicant argues that the Officer's conclusion with respect to his criminality is ambiguous, as she states in both decisions that the gravity of his crime did "not outweigh" the positive factors but nevertheless refused the applications. According to the Applicant, this is not necessarily just a typographical error.
[17]
With respect to the TRP decision, the Applicant repeats many of his arguments with respect to the Sponsorship Decision, but also argues that it was unreasonable for the Officer to dismiss his interest in rehabilitation as self-serving; he had the obligation to establish his case and the Officer would have likely found his chances of rehabilitation to be minimal had he not shown interest in such programs. In this regard, the Applicant relies upon the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
B.
The Respondent's Arguments
[18]
The Respondent emphasizes that decisions with respect to both the TRP and the H&C application deserve deference as they are exceptional and highly discretionary, and require a balancing of various factors by the Officer. The Respondent argues that the Officer adequately considered all of the positive factors but was entitled to give more weight to the Applicant's criminality. The Respondent argues that this Court should not reweigh evidence before the Officer.
[19]
According to the Respondent, the Applicant could return to Saint Lucia and work as a barber and possibly other positions since he now has additional experience here in Canada. The fact that better employment opportunities may be available to the Applicant here in Canada is not sufficient reason to grant an exemption from the
Act
or a TRP.
[20]
The Respondent argues that the best interests of the children is not a determinative factor, and the Applicant's disagreement with the weight that factor was assigned does not disclose an error. The Respondent says that the letter from the Applicant's mother is insufficient evidence as to the Applicant's support of his children in Saint Lucia. The Applicant did not provide any corroborative evidence in this regard.
[21]
As to the doctor's letter concerning Malachi, the Respondent says that the Officer's conclusion that there may be temporary services is plausible. The letter upon which the Applicant relied did not conclude that such services would be impossible to obtain but, rather, only implied that they may be difficult to obtain for the Applicant's son.
[22]
The Respondent says that when one reads the Officer's decisions as a whole, it is clear that she made a typographical error when she said that the gravity of the Applicant's crime did "not" outweigh the positive factors. The Respondent says that such an error should not attract relief, since it is clear from the rest of the decision that the Officer meant the opposite (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Respondent also points out that the quality of the Officer's reasons is not an independent ground of review (citing
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
As to the TRP, the Respondent repeats some of the same arguments with respect to the Sponsorship Decision and emphasizes that the Applicant's interest in rehabilitation is self-serving and supported by nothing but the Applicant's say-so; there is no corroboration such as a letter from the John Howard Society.
IV.
Issues and Analysis
A.
Standard of Review
[24]
The parties agree in their written memoranda that the standard of review for both decisions is reasonableness, so the only issues in these applications are whether the Officer's decisions were reasonable.
[25]
The appropriate standard of review for an H&C decision is that of reasonableness since it involves questions of mixed fact and law: see, e.g.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada stated that, when reviewing an H&C decision, "considerable deference should be accorded to immigration officers exercising the powers conferred by the legislation, given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, its role within the statutory scheme as an exception, the fact that the decision-maker is the Minister, and the considerable discretion evidenced by the statutory language."
[26]
Issuance of a TRP under subsection 24(1) of the
Act
is also a highly discretionary decision, and it too attracts the reasonableness standard of review (see: e.g.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 258;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 808 (QL); and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 53).
[27]
Accordingly, the Court should not interfere if each of the Officer's decisions is intelligible, transparent, and justifiable and falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law. It is not up to this Court to reweigh the evidence that was before the Officer, and it is not the function of this Court upon judicial review to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
B.
Were the Officer's Decisions Reasonable?
(1) The Sponsorship Decision
[28]
The Officer in this case did not ignore the evidence before her or otherwise err in finding that the Applicant had not proven that he would be unable to find employment in Saint Lucia. It was reasonable for the Officer to conclude that the Applicant could return to Saint Lucia and work as a barber. The fact that the Applicant's brothers had apparently remained unemployed in Saint Lucia following their removal from Canada was reasonably found by the Officer to be insufficient evidence as to his inability to be employed upon return.
[29]
Also, it cannot be said that the Officer here was not alert and sensitive to the best interests of each of the Applicant's several children as well as his sponsor's two children. For example, the Officer specifically noted that the emotional and financial impact upon his biological child in Canada was a compelling positive factor to forestall the Applicant's removal. However, there was little evidence to show that the Applicant could not support this child from Saint Lucia or that he could not live with her there. In this regard, the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , deserves note, where the Court stated that: "... an applicant has the burden of adducing proof of any claim on which the H & C application relies. Hence, if an applicant provides no evidence to support the claim, the officer may conclude that it is baseless."
[30]
I agree with the Respondent that when one reads the Officer's Sponsorship Decision as a whole, and in view of her reasons as to the Applicant's establishment and the best interests of the children affected by the Applicant's removal, it is clear that the word "not" in the last paragraph of this decision, with reference to the gravity of the Applicant's crime, is a typographical error. Such an error does not negate the rest of the Officer's analysis and reasons for her decision. It is clear from her reasons as well as the decision letter itself that the Officer intended to state that the Applicant's criminality "does" outweigh the positive factors, and this sort of error should not attract relief.
[31]
For example, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Lu
], Mr. Justice Simon Noël dealt with a situation where a word had been inserted in the officer's decision letter. Justice Noël stated:
[29] ... The fact that Officer Tsang wrote in her letter to the Applicant that "you are therefore criminally inadmissible to Canada" is in my opinion an error which can be associated to a typographical error and it is not of a conclusive nature. ... Officer Tsang, although she makes reference to the "inadmissibility" provisions of IRPA, did not conclude that the Applicant was inadmissible due to criminality under section 36 of the Act.
[30] Justice Russell in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  addressed the implications of a typographical error in a decision's makers reasons under review by the Court. At paragraph 51 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Russell writes:
When a mistake is typographical in nature, the Court should not interfere with the decision, especially if the error does not appear to have been a misunderstanding of the evidence
. Nadon J. in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the record that the Refugee Division did not misunderstand the situation regarding the visit of two men noted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff testified that two men visited Pritam Singh's room. He did not testify that those individuals visited him, and I feel sure that the word "claimant" contained in the sentence:
The claimant told the police that on two occasions he saw two individuals whom he could not identify visiting the claimant in his room...
is a typographical mistake. In any case, if there is an error it is not a conclusive error and certainly could not justify intervention by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
In my view, there is no reason why the error made by Officer Tsang should result in the Court intervening in the case at bar. There is no indication in Officer Tsang's letter that she misunderstood the evidence ... [Emphasis in
Lu
]
[32]
In view of the foregoing, therefore, I find that the Officer's Sponsorship Decision is understandable and justifiable and, also, falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law.
(2) The TRP Decision
[33]
The objectives and exceptional nature of an exemption under subsection 24(1) of the
Act
have been described in detail by my colleague Justice Shore in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 54 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]:
[22] The objective of section 24 of IRPA is to soften the sometimes harsh consequences of the strict application of IRPA which surfaces in cases where there may be "compelling reasons" to allow a foreign national to enter or remain in Canada despite inadmissibility or non-compliance with IRPA. Basically, the TRPs allow officers to respond to exceptional circumstances while meeting Canada's social, humanitarian, and economic commitments. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL).)
[23] Before a TRP is issued, consideration must be given to the fact that TRPs grant their bearer more privileges than do visitor, student or work permits. Like the foreign nationals from those two categories, a TRP bearer becomes a temporary resident after being examined upon his entry to Canada, but may also be eligible for health or social services and can apply for a work or student permit from Canada. Furthermore, he may obtain, without discretion, permanent resident status if he resides in Canada throughout the validity period and does not become inadmissible on other grounds than those for which the TRP was granted. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  recommended and issued cautiously. Parliament was aware of the exceptional nature of TRPs and has retained a supervisory function in their regard; thus the Minister includes in the annual report to Parliament the number of TRPs granted under s. 24 of IRPA, "categorized according to grounds of inadmissibility, if any." ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of IRPA.)
[34]
Furthermore, although an officer is not expressly compelled to look at the best interests of any children affected in a TRP application ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 36), the Officer here did so anyway. The Officer's assessments in this regard show that she was alive and attentive to the Applicant's whole situation.
[35]
In refusing the TRP application, the Officer provided essentially the same reasons as she had with respect to the Sponsorship Decision. The only significant difference in the TRP Decision was in how the Officer treated the circumstances surrounding the Applicant's criminal convictions. The Officer added to her earlier observations that the fact the Applicant had served his sentence in the community was a positive factor insofar as it showed that the court did not consider the Applicant to be a danger to society. However, the Applicant's inquiries into rehabilitation courses were found by the Officer to be self-serving, and she noted that he had not actually attended or completed any rehabilitation of his own volition. In light of that, it was reasonable for the Officer to determine that the Applicant had provided insufficient evidence of his remorse or as to whether he would not reoffend.
[36]
It is implicit in the TRP Decision that the Officer refused the Applicant's request for a TRP since she was not "of the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances" (
Act
, s 24(1)), nor were there sufficiently "compelling reasons" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 22). The Officer considered the negative and positive factors as presented by the Applicant. Her reasoning was understandable and justifiable and, also, her decision falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law.
[37]
The best interests of the Applicant's children were undoubtedly positive considerations, but ultimately those were outweighed by the seriousness of the Applicant's crimes and lack of rehabilitative efforts. It is not for this Court to engage in an exercise of reweighing those factors. While a different decision could have been made, it has not been established that the decision made was not available to the Officer under the law or lacks a proper factual foundation so as to be unreasonable.
V.
Conclusion
[38]
In the result, therefore, the Applicant's applications for judicial review should be and are hereby dismissed. Neither party suggested a question for certification; so, no such question is certified.
JUDGMENT
[39]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. the application for judicial review in each of Court files IMM-2916-13 and IMM-2918-13 is dismissed;
2. no question is certified; and
3. a copy of this judgment and reasons shall be placed in each of Court files IMM-2916-13 and IMM-2918-13.

Le juge Boswell
[Traduction]: En application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), M. Evans (le demandeur) demande le contrôle judiciaire de deux décisions rendues par une même agente d'immigration (l'agente): dans la première décision, l'agente a rejeté sa demande de résidence permanente pour cause d'interdiction de territoire et a refusé de lui accorder les dispenses demandées sur le fondement du paragraphe 25(1) de la Loi; dans la deuxième, elle a refusé de lui délivrer un permis de séjour temporaire (PST) en vertu du paragraphe 24(1) de la Loi. Les deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire ont été entendues ensemble conformément aux ordonnances, en date du 15 octobre 2014, par lesquelles la Cour a accordé l'autorisation d'exercer un recours en contrôle judiciaire.
[2]
Le demandeur demande à la Cour d'annuler ces deux décisions et de renvoyer les affaires à un autre agent pour qu'il statue à nouveau sur les demandes. Par les présents motifs de jugement, la Cour statue sur les deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire. J'ordonne donc qu'un exemplaire du présent jugement et motifs soit versé dans chacun des dossiers IMM-2916-13 et IMM-2918-13.
[3]
Le demandeur est un citoyen de Sainte-Lucie, âgé de 35 ans, qui est arrivé au Canada le 5 octobre 2003. En septembre 2010, à la suite du rejet à la fois de sa demande d'asile et de sa demande d'évaluation des risques avant renvoi, le demandeur s'est efforcé de régulariser sa situation en présentant une demande de résidence permanente au titre de la catégorie des époux ou conjoints de fait au Canada.
[4]
Le 18 décembre 2012, toutefois, le demandeur a été reconnu coupable de trafic de cocaïne et d'entrave à un agent de la paix. Le surlendemain, l'agente lui a envoyé une lettre l'informant que sa demande pouvait être refusée, puisqu'il était apparemment interdit de territoire au Canada en vertu des alinéas 36(1)
a
) et 36(2)
a
) de la Loi. Le demandeur a répondu par une lettre, datée du 31 janvier 2013, dans laquelle il admettait qu'il était interdit de territoire, mais affirmait qu'il existait des motifs d'ordre humanitaire (CH) lui permettant de rester au Canada. Il a demandé qu'on lui délivre un PST ou qu'on le dispense de l'application des dispositions de la Loi selon lesquelles il était interdit de territoire.
II.
Décisions faisant l'objet du contrôle
A.
La décision relative au parrainage conjugal (la décision relative au parrainage)
[5]
Dans une lettre datée du 9 avril 2013, l'agente a refusé la demande de résidence permanente du demandeur, estimant qu'en raison de sa condamnation pour trafic de drogues, il était interdit de territoire pour grande criminalité en vertu de l'alinéa 36(1)
a
), et qu'en raison de sa condamnation pour entrave à un agent de la paix, il était interdit de territoire pour criminalité en vertu de l'alinéa 36(2)
a
).
[6]
Bien qu'elle ait reconnu le caractère véritable de la relation du demandeur avec son répondant, l'agente a conclu que les motifs d'ordre humanitaire invoqués par le demandeur n'étaient pas suffisants pour l'emporter sur l'interdiction de territoire. Sur la question de l'établissement, l'agente a noté que le demandeur avait travaillé pendant quatre ans -- sans interruption -- comme coiffeur à Sainte-Lucie avant son arrivée au Canada, et a donc rejeté sa prétention qu'il lui serait impossible de trouver un emploi s'il était renvoyé à Sainte-Lucie.
[7]
L'agente a reconnu que le demandeur a quatre enfants mineurs dont les intérêts sont touchés: Misha et Inika, qui sont nées à Sainte-Lucie et y résident encore; Malachi, qui est né au Canada, mais qui a accompagné sa mère à Sainte-Lucie lorsque celle-ci a été renvoyée du Canada; Amai, née au Canada et fille du demandeur et de sa conjointe, qui cherche à le parrainer. Cette dernière a aussi deux autres filles qui considèrent le demandeur comme leur père.
[8]
Le demandeur avait soutenu que son renvoi, et la perte conséquente de revenus, porteraient préjudice à ses enfants à Sainte-Lucie. Or, le demandeur n'a pas établi de façon suffisante qu'il subvenait aux besoins de ces enfants, et l'agente a jugé qu'il ne se retrouverait pas au chômage à Sainte-Lucie. S'agissant de Malachi, l'agente a noté qu'il souffre d'un trouble du langage nécessitant le recours à un orthophoniste. Dans une lettre présentée par le demandeur, un médecin affirmait qu'il n'y avait pas d'orthophoniste permanent à Sainte-Lucie et qu'il est difficile d'y trouver une école adaptée, mais l'agente a conclu que cette lettre ne précisait pas s'il y avait des orthophonistes à temps partiel, ou qu'il serait impossible de trouver une école. N'ayant été saisie d'aucun autre élément de preuve sur cette question, l'agente a dit qu'elle ne pouvait pas déterminer les ressources qui s'offriraient à Malachi à Sainte-Lucie. De plus, le demandeur n'avait ni fourni le motif du renvoi de la mère de Malachi, ni indiqué s'il existait pour elle une possibilité de retour au Canada.
[9]
L'agente a jugé que les incidences du renvoi du demandeur sur Amai étaient un facteur positif important et déterminant, mais elle a toutefois mentionné qu'il existait peu d'éléments démontrant que le demandeur ne pourrait ni subvenir à ses besoins depuis Sainte-Lucie, ni l'emmener advenant qu'il soit renvoyé du pays. Le renvoi du demandeur toucherait aussi sa conjointe, mais l'agente a observé que celle-ci savait au moins dans une certaine mesure, quand elle a entamé une relation avec lui, que le demandeur n'avait pas de statut. Rien ne prouvait non plus qu'elle ne pourrait pas lui rendre visite à Sainte-Lucie.
[10]
L'agente a aussi reconnu que les deux autres enfants de sa conjointe, Cheyelle (qui a maintenant 22 ans) et Chamaul (qui a maintenant 19 ans), considèrent tous deux le demandeur comme un père. Cependant, rien ne permettait de croire qu'il les soutenait financièrement ou qu'il lui serait impossible d'entretenir une relation avec elles s'il était renvoyé.
[11]
Enfin, l'agente a soupesé les éléments favorables en fonction de la gravité du crime et de la décision par la cour de l'assigner à résidence pendant six mois, à titre de sanction. Il s'agissait de ses premières condamnations, mais l'agente a observé que le demandeur avait été déjà été accusé de crimes. Bien qu'il ait manifesté des remords et fait part de sa volonté de s'améliorer, le demandeur n'avait suivi aucun programme de réadaptation. L'agente a fini par conclure que, en l'espèce, les difficultés n'étaient pas inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, ajoutant que [traduction] « la gravité du crime du demandeur
ne
l'emporte
pas
sur les facteurs favorables » (non souligné dans l'original).
B.
Décision relative au permis de séjour temporaire (décision relative au PST)
[12]
Dans des motifs distincts également datés du 9 avril 2013, l'agente a refusé de délivrer un PST au demandeur (bien que la lettre lui signifiant la décision porte la date incorrecte du 3 octobre 2012), invoquant essentiellement les mêmes motifs, relativement aux considérations d'ordre humanitaire, que pour sa décision relative au parrainage.
[13]
La seule différence notable dans cette décision était le traitement par l'agente des circonstances entourant les condamnations du demandeur. L'agente a ajouté à ses observations précédentes que le fait que le demandeur a purgé sa peine dans la communauté était un élément en sa faveur, dans la mesure où cela démontrait que la cour estimait que le demandeur ne constituait pas un danger pour la société. L'agente a cependant noté que le comportement du demandeur faisait quand même l'objet d'un contrôle très serré par la cour et que son prétendu intérêt dans les programmes de réadaptation semblait plutôt intéressé. Comme pour la décision relative au parrainage, l'agente a conclu que [traduction] « la gravité du crime du demandeur ne l'emporte pas sur les facteurs d'ordre humanitaire invoqués par le demandeur. Ce dernier n'a pas démontré de façon suffisante qu'il avait du remord ou qu'il ne récidiverait pas » (non souligné dans l'original).
III.
Arguments des parties
A.
Arguments du demandeur
[14]
Le demandeur soutient que l'agente a omis de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve probants dans sa décision sur son établissement au  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 17, 157 FTR 35 (1re inst.)). Le demandeur affirme que la décision de l'agente était déraisonnable en ce qu'elle ne tenait pas dûment compte de la preuve selon laquelle il avait dû fermer son salon de coiffure à Sainte-Lucie parce qu'il avait reçu des menaces de trafiquants de drogue. Il ajoute que l'agente n'a tenu aucun compte du fort taux de chômage qui sévit à Sainte-Lucie, comme en témoigne le fait que ses frères étaient sans emploi depuis leur retour à Sainte-Lucie, et qu'elle n'a pas dûment examiné les autres indices d'établissement, comme le soutien familial dont il jouit au  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 261.
[15]
Concernant l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, le demandeur déclare que les conclusions de l'agente sont ambigües en ce sens que celle-ci a affirmé que le demandeur ne soutenait pas financièrement sa famille, tout en concluant que rien ne prouvait qu'il ne pourrait pas
continuer
de subvenir aux besoins de sa famille depuis Sainte-Lucie. Quant à Malachi, le demandeur affirme que l'agente a tiré des inférences injustifiées de la lettre du médecin, et qu'elle n'avait aucune raison de conclure que la mère de Malachi pourrait peut-être retourner au Canada.
[16]
Le demandeur soutient aussi que l'agente ne s'est pas acquittée de son obligation d'expliquer en termes clairs et non équivoques sa conclusion concernant la gravité de son crime (citant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (2d) 199 (CA)). Le demandeur soutient que la conclusion de l'agente sur la question de la criminalité est ambigüe en ce que l'agente a indiqué, dans les deux décisions, que la gravité de son crime [traduction] « ne l'emporte pas sur les facteurs favorables », mais a néanmoins rejeté les demandes. Selon le demandeur, il ne s'agit pas nécessairement d'une simple erreur typographique.
[17]
Quant à la décision relative au PST, le demandeur reprend plusieurs des arguments invoqués à l'égard de la décision relative au parrainage, mais soutient aussi qu'il était déraisonnable pour l'agente de ne pas tenir compte de son intérêt pour la réadaptation, qu'elle a qualifié d'intéressé; il lui incombait d'établir le bien-fondé de ses prétentions, et l'agente aurait probablement conclu qu'il avait très peu de chance de réadaptation s'il n'avait manifesté aucun intérêt dans de tels programmes. À cet égard, le demandeur s'appuie sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
B.
Arguments du défendeur
[18]
Le défendeur souligne que la retenue judiciaire s'impose à l'égard des décisions sur la demande de PST et sur la demande fondée sur des considérations humanitaires puisqu'elles sont de nature exceptionnelle et hautement discrétionnaire et qu'elles obligent l'agente à soupeser différents éléments. Le défendeur soutient que l'agente a tenu compte de manière adéquate de tous les éléments favorables, mais qu'elle pouvait accorder plus de poids aux antécédents du demandeur en matière de criminalité. Le défendeur affirme que la Cour doit s'abstenir d'apprécier à nouveau la preuve dont disposait l'agente.
[19]
Selon le défendeur, le demandeur pourrait retourner à Sainte-Lucie et travailler comme coiffeur ou exercer peut-être un autre emploi, puisqu'il a acquis de l'expérience ici même au Canada. La possibilité que le demandeur ait accès à de meilleurs emplois au Canada n'est pas un motif suffisant pour le dispenser de l'application de la Loi ou lui accorder un PST.
[20]
Le défendeur soutient que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants n'est pas un facteur déterminant, et que ce n'est pas parce que le demandeur n'est pas d'accord avec l'agente quant au poids accordé à ce facteur qu'il y a erreur. Le défendeur déclare que la lettre de la mère du demandeur ne permet pas de conclure que ce dernier pourrait subvenir aux besoins de ses enfants à Sainte-Lucie. Le demandeur n'a produit aucun élément corroborant à cet égard.
[21]
S'agissant de la lettre du médecin au sujet de Malachi, le défendeur déclare que la conclusion de l'agente, à savoir qu'il existe peut-être des services temporaires, est plausible. La lettre sur laquelle se fonde le demandeur n'indique pas qu'il est impossible de bénéficier de tels services, mais laisse plutôt entendre qu'il serait peut-être difficile pour son fils d'y avoir accès.
[22]
Le défendeur déclare qu'à la lecture de l'ensemble des décisions de l'agente, il est manifeste qu'elle a commis une erreur typographique quand elle a dit que la gravité du crime du demandeur [traduction] « ne l'emporte pas » sur les facteurs favorables. Le défendeur affirme qu'une telle erreur ne doit pas donner lieu à réparation, puisqu'il ressort clairement du reste de la décision que l'agente voulait dire le contraire (citant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le défendeur signale aussi que la qualité des motifs de l'agente n'est pas un motif de contrôle indépendant (citant
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
Quant aux PST, le défendeur reprend certains des arguments invoqués à l'égard de la décision relative au parrainage et souligne que l'intérêt manifesté par le demandeur pour la réadaptation est intéressé, et n'est étayé par rien d'autre que les dires du demandeur; il n'existe aucun élément corroborant, par exemple une lettre de la John Howard Society.
IV.
Questions et analyse
A.
Norme de contrôle
[24]
Les parties ont convenu dans leur mémoire écrit que la norme de contrôle applicable aux deux décisions est celle de la décision raisonnable; ainsi, les seules questions à trancher en l'espèce concernent le caractère raisonnable des décisions de l'agente.
[25]
La norme de contrôle applicable à une décision relative à une demande fondée sur des considérations humanitaires est celle de la décision raisonnable, puisqu'elle porte sur des questions mixtes de faits et de droit: voir, par exemple,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Dunsmuir)
. Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu, à l'égard de l'examen d'une décision fondée sur des considérations humanitaires, « qu'on devrait faire preuve d'une retenue considérable envers les décisions d'agents d'immigration exerçant les pouvoirs conférés par la loi, compte tenu de la nature factuelle de l'analyse, de son rôle d'exception au sein du régime législatif, du fait que le décideur est le ministre, et de la large discrétion accordée par le libellé de la loi ».
[26]
La délivrance d'un PST en vertu du paragraphe 24(1) de la Loi est de même une décision fortement discrétionnaire, qui elle aussi commande l'application de la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable (voir par exemple
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 258;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF No 808 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53).
[27]
En conséquence, la Cour ne doit pas intervenir si chacune des décisions de l'agente est intelligible, transparente et justifiable, et qu'elle appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Il n'appartient pas à la Cour de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve présentés à l'agente, ni de substituer à la décision, à l'occasion d'un contrôle judiciaire, l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
B.
Les décisions de l'agente étaient-elles raisonnables?
(1) La décision relative au parrainage
[28]
L'agente en l'espèce n'a pas fait abstraction de la preuve dont elle disposait ou commis une erreur quand elle a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas établi qu'il lui serait impossible de trouver un emploi à Sainte-Lucie. L'agente a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur pouvait retourner à Sainte-Lucie et y travailler comme coiffeur et que le fait que les frères du demandeur se soient apparemment retrouvés sans emploi à Sainte-Lucie à la suite de leur renvoi du Canada n'établissait pas de façon suffisante que le demandeur ne pourrait pas se trouver un emploi à son retour.
[29]
De plus, on ne saurait dire que l'agente en l'espèce n'a pas été réceptive et sensible à l'intérêt supérieur de chacun des enfants du demandeur, de même que des deux enfants de son répondant. Par exemple, l'agente a mentionné expressément que les incidences émotionnelles et financières sur son enfant naturelle au Canada est un élément convaincant et favorable, s'agissant d'empêcher le renvoi du demandeur. Toutefois, il y avait peu d'éléments de preuve que le demandeur ne pourrait pas subvenir aux besoins de cette enfant depuis Sainte-Lucie, ou qu'il ne pourrait pas y vivre avec elle. À cet égard, la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , est digne de mention; la Cour d'appel fédérale déclarait que « ... le demandeur a le fardeau de prouver toute allégation sur laquelle il fonde sa demande pour des raisons humanitaires. Par voie de conséquence, si un demandeur ne soumet aucune preuve à l'appui de son allégation, l'agent est en droit de conclure qu'elle n'est pas fondée ».
[30]
Je suis d'accord avec le défendeur qu'à la lecture de l'ensemble de la décision de l'agente relative au parrainage, et au vu de ses motifs quant à l'établissement du demandeur et à l'intérêt supérieur des enfants touchés par son renvoi, il est manifeste que le terme [traduction] « ne [...] pas » au dernier paragraphe de cette décision, renvoyant à la gravité du crime du demandeur, est une erreur typographique. Une telle erreur n'invalide pas le reste de l'analyse faite par l'agente et les motifs de sa décision. Il ressort clairement de ses motifs aussi bien que de la lettre de décision même que l'agente voulait dire que les actes criminels du demandeur l'emportent en fait sur les facteurs favorables. Une erreur de cette nature ne devrait pas donner lieu à réparation.
[31]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Lu)
, le juge Simon Noël était saisi d'une affaire où un mot avait été inséré dans la lettre de décision de l'agente. Le juge Noël s'est exprimé en ces termes:
[29] ... Le fait que l'agente Tsang a écrit dans sa lettre au demandeur qu'il était « [...] donc interdit de territoire au Canada [...] » représente, à mon avis, une erreur qui peut être associée à une erreur typographique et qui n'est pas de nature décisive [...] l'agente Tsang n'a pas conclu que le demandeur était interdit de territoire pour criminalité en vertu de l'article 36 de la Loi, même si elle fait mention des dispositions sur l'« interdiction de territoire » de la LIPR.
[30] Le juge Russell, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a traité des répercussions d'une erreur typographique sur les motifs d'un décideur qui sont revus par la Cour. Au paragraphe 51 de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, le juge Russell écrit:
Lorsqu'une erreur est de nature typographique, la Cour ne doit pas modifier la décision, surtout si l'erreur ne semble pas être le résultat d'une incompréhension de la preuve
. Dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  décision contestée:
... Il est clair, à la lecture du dossier, que la Section du statut ne s'est pas méprise quant à la visite de deux hommes qu'aurait remarquée le demandeur. Le demandeur a témoigné que deux hommes auraient visité la chambre de Pritam Singh. Il n'a pas témoigné que ces individus l'ont visité, et je suis convaincu que le mot « claimant » que l'on retrouve dans la phrase:
The claimant told the police that on two occasions he saw two individuals whom he could not identify visiting the claimant in his room [...]
est une erreur typographique. De toute façon, s'il y a erreur, cette erreur n'est pas déterminante et ne peut certainement pas justifier une intervention de ma part.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
Selon moi, rien ne justifie que l'erreur commise par l'agente Tsang se traduise par une intervention de la Cour en l'espèce. Rien n'indique, dans la lettre de l'agente Tsang, qu'elle a mal compris la preuve ... (Souligné dans
Lu
)
[32]
Compte tenu de ce qui précède, je conclus que la décision de l'agente relative au parrainage est intelligible et justifiable, et aussi qu'elle appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
(2) La décision sur le PST
[33]
Les objectifs et le caractère exceptionnel de la dispense prévue au paragraphe 24(1) de la Loi ont été décrits en détail par mon collègue le juge Shore dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 54 (
Farhat)
:
[22] On vise avec l'article 24 de la LIPR à rendre moins sévères les conséquences qu'entraîne dans certains cas la stricte application de la LIPR, lorsqu'il existe des « raisons impérieuses » pour qu'il soit permis à un étranger d'entrer ou de demeurer au Canada malgré l'interdiction de territoire ou l'inobservation de la LIPR. Fondamentalement, le permis de séjour temporaire permet aux agents d'intervenir dans des circonstances exceptionnelles tout en remplissant les engagements sociaux, humanitaires et économiques du Canada. (Guide de l'immigration, ch. OP 20, section 2; pièce B de l'affidavit d'Alexander Lukie;
Canada (Ministre de la Main-d'œuvre et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL).)
[23] Avant qu'un PST ne soit délivré, l'on doit tenir compte du fait que ce permis octroie à son titulaire des privilèges plus importants que ceux qui sont accordés aux visiteurs, aux étudiants et aux travailleurs. Comme l'étranger de ces deux catégories, le titulaire d'un PST devient résident temporaire après un examen à son entrée au Canada, mais il peut en outre avoir accès aux services sociaux ou de santé et demander un permis de travail ou d'études à partir du Canada. N'est en outre assujetti à aucun pouvoir discrétionnaire l'octroi de la résidence permanente aux personnes qui résident au Canada pendant toute la période de validité du permis et ne deviennent pas interdites de territoire pour d'autres motifs que ceux ayant justifié l'octroi du PST. (Guide de l'immigration, ch. OP 20, section 5.7; pièce B de l'affidavit d'Alexander Lukie.
[24] C'est donc avec circonspection que l'on doit recommander la délivrance d'un PST et y procéder. Le législateur avait bien conscience de la nature exceptionnelle des PST et il s'est réservé un rôle de surveillance à cet égard; le ministre fait ainsi état dans son rapport annuel au Parlement du nombre de PST délivrés en application de l'article 24 de la LIPR, les « données [étant] réparties selon les motifs d'interdiction de territoire ». (Guide de l'immigration, ch. OP 20, sections 5.2 (paragraphe 2) et 5.22; pièce B de l'affidavit d'Alexander Lukie; paragraphe 94(2) de la LIPR.)
[34]
De plus, même si l'agent n'a pas l'obligation expresse de prendre en compte l'intérêt supérieur des enfants touchés par une demande de PST ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 36), il demeure que l'agente l'a fait en l'espèce. Les examens que l'agente a faits à cet égard témoignent qu'elle était réceptive, attentive et sensible à l'ensemble de la situation du demandeur.
[35]
En refusant la demande de PST, l'agente a fourni essentiellement les mêmes motifs que dans sa décision relative au parrainage. La seule différence notable dans la décision relative au PST est la façon dont l'agente traite des circonstances entourant les condamnations au criminel du demandeur. L'agente a ajouté à ses observations précédentes que le fait que le demandeur a purgé sa peine dans la communauté était un élément en sa faveur, dans la mesure où cela démontrait que, pour la cour, le demandeur ne constituait pas un danger pour la société. Elle a toutefois jugé que les questions du demandeur concernant le programme de réadaptation étaient plutôt intéressées, précisant qu'il n'avait, de son propre gré, participé à aucun programme ni suivi aucun programme jusqu'au bout. Compte tenu de ce qui précède, l'agente pouvait raisonnablement décider que les éléments de preuve fournis par le demandeur ne permettaient pas de conclure qu'il avait des remords ou qu'il ne récidiverait pas.
[36]
Il ressort implicitement de la décision relative au PST que l'agente a refusé la demande de PST du demandeur parce qu'elle n'estimait pas « que les circonstances le justifient » (Loi, paragraphe 24(1)), et qu'il n'existait pas non plus de « raisons impérieuses » suffisantes ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 22). L'agente a examiné les éléments défavorables et favorables présentés par le demandeur. Son raisonnement était intelligible et justifiable, et de plus sa décision fait partie des issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[37]
Il ne fait pas de doute que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants du demandeur était une considération favorable, mais la gravité des crimes du demandeur et le manque d'efforts de réadaptation ont fini par l'emporter. Il n'appartient pas à la Cour de soupeser à nouveau ces facteurs. Quoiqu'une décision différente eût pu être rendue, il n'a pas été démontré que la décision de l'agente n'était pas fondée en droit ou qu'elle était déraisonnable faute d'un fondement factuel valable.
