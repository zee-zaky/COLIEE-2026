I.
Preliminary
[S]ection 97 must not be interpreted in a manner that strips it of any content or meaning. If any risk created by "criminal activity" is always considered a general risk, it is hard to fathom a scenario in which the requirements of section 97 would ever be met. Instead of focusing on whether the risk is created by criminal activity, the Board must direct its attention to the question before it: whether the claimant would face a personal risk to his or her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and whether that risk is one not faced generally by other individuals in or from the country. Because the Board failed to properly undertake this inquiry in this case, the decision must be set aside.
(As explained by Justice Donald J. Rennie in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ))
II.
Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
[Translation]: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA) against a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) refusing the applicant's refugee claim under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.
III.
Facts
[2]
The applicant is a merchant and citizen of Honduras.
[3]
Since February 2015, the applicant operated a cell phone repair store in the city of Sigualtepeque, Honduras.
[4]
Between March 10 and 22, 2014, the applicant was a victim of death threats and extortion of a [translation] "war tax" by members of the Maras 18.
[5]
On March 21, 2014, the applicant discussed with merchants from his neighbourhood so as to form an association to resist the Maras 18. As a result of these discussions, the applicant presented himself at the police station accompanied by another member of the merchants' association, so as to file a complaint against the Maras 18.
[6]
On April 9, 2014, a group of the Maras 18 went to the applicant's store looking to kill him. The applicant was not there at the time.
[7]
Fearing for his life, the applicant left Honduras on April 20, 2014, and presented a refugee claim at the Canada-USA border on July 3, 2014.
[8]
A hearing was held before the RPD on September 3, 2014.
IV.
Decision under review
[9]
In a decision dated September 19, 2014, the RPD found that the applicant is not a "person in need of protection" under subparagraph 97(1)(
b
)(ii) of the IRPA because of the lack of credibility and the generalized nature of risk to which he is exposed.
A.
Applicant's credibility
[10]
The RPD agreed that the applicant operated a cell phone repair store between February 2014 and April 2014 and that he was a victim of extortion on three occasions by the Maras 18 between March 10 and 22, 2014.
[11]
However, the RPD rejected the applicant's claim that he would be exposed to a personalized risk provided in section 97 of the IRPA for creating a merchants' association against the Maras 18.
[12]
Specifically, the RPD determined that:
[translation]
As the applicant was confronted with questions, he invented answers and dug himself deeper into contradictions. The panel does not believe that the Maras 18 came to get him on April 9, 2014, because they became aware that he had proposed to create an association to bring together merchants against the Maras 18 by seeking out police protection.
(RPD's decision at para 13)
B.
Generalized risk
[13]
The RPD determined that the applicant was personally exposed to a prospective risk of extortion. Moreover, the RPD found that it was a generalized risk, which is similar to the same risk as that to which Honduran merchants are generally exposed.
V.
Statutory provisions
[14]
The following sections of the IRPA apply to the determination of the applicant's refugee status:
Convention refugee
96
. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(
b
) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97
. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(
a
) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
Définition de « réfugié »
96
. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a)
soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b)
soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
Personne à protéger
97
. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a)
soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b)
soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
VI.
Issues
[15]
This application presents the following issues:
a) Are the RPD's credibility findings reasonable?
b) Are the RPD's findings on generalized risk reasonable?
VII.
Parties' arguments
A.
Applicant's arguments
[16]
The applicant argued that the RPD made unreasonable findings by conducting a microscopic examination of issues peripheral to the applicant's refugee claim (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[17]
According to the applicant, the RPD's findings are not supported by the evidence in the record. In particular, the RPD erred in finding that the applicant provided contradictory testimony regarding the creation of a merchants' association against the Maras 18.
[18]
Then, the applicant claimed that it is unreasonable for the RPD to agree, on the one hand, that the applicant was personally targeted by the Maras 18 as a merchant and to conclude, on the other hand, that the risk he is exposed to is a generalized risk.
[19]
Further, the applicant alleges that the RPD neglected to consider the impact of his opposition to the Maras 18 in light of the documentary evidence, which shows that the members of the Maras 18 retaliate violently against those who dispute their authority.
[20]
Finally, the applicant argued that the personal threat to the applicant's life was not reasonably assessed by the RPD.
B.
Respondent's arguments
[21]
First, the respondent argued that the RPD's finding that the applicant is not credible with respect to his alleged prospective risk is reasonable, given the contradictions in the applicant's evidence.
[22]
Furthermore, the respondent claims that it was open to the RPD not to accept the explanations provided by the applicant in his testimony.
[23]
Then, the respondent argued that it is well established that individuals who fear being the victims of extortion are not Convention refugees. It was reasonable for the RPD to find that the risk alleged by the applicant, i.e. that he was threatened, attacked and extorted by criminalized groups, is part of the generalized risk to which most citizens of Honduras are exposed and specifically business owners or merchants.
VIII.
Standard of review
[24]
It is well-established case law that issues relating to credibility, and those relating to generalized risk, are questions of fact or questions of mixed fact and law, which are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[25]
Therefore, the Court must limit its review of the RPD's decision to "justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process and also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47).
IX.
Analysis
A.
Are the RPD's credibility findings reasonable?
[26]
The assessment of the applicant's credibility is at the heart of the RPD's jurisdiction, who is in the best position to weigh the testimony and the evidence, as a whole (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). From this perspective, it is not the role of this Court to substitute its opinion for the RPD's credibility findings (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 59).
[27]
Then, the minor or secondary inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence should not induce the RPD to find that the applicant had a general lack of credibility if the documentary evidence confirms the plausibility of his story (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
[28]
In this case, the RPD found that the applicant is not credible with respect to his fear of personally being the target of retaliation by the Maras 18 for attempting to form a merchants' association (RPD's decision at para 6 to 13).
[29]
First, the RPD rejects the applicant's testimony relating to the date of formation and the composition of the merchants' association. According to the RPD, the applicant testified inconsistently with respect to the exact time when the decision to form the association and file a complaint with the police was made. Furthermore, the RPD seems to draw a negative inference from the fact that ultimately, four of the merchants never showed up to accompany the applicant to file a complaint with the police.
[30]
Second, the RPD raised doubts as to the circumstances surrounding the complaint filed with the police by the applicant. In particular, the RPD observed that, initially, the applicant claimed that he did not file a complaint with the police for the reason that the person in charge was absent but that, further, the applicant indicated at question 2(c) of his Claim for Refugee Protection Form (CRPF) that he did not complain of the extortion against him, because the police was not able to protect him.
[31]
These findings led the RPD to conclude that the applicant was inventing answers as he was confronted with questions, thus undermining his credibility.
[32]
Following a careful reading of the file brought before the RPD and the transcript of the hearing, the Court noted that the RPD's negative findings on the applicant's credibility are problematic in some ways.
[33]
From the transcript of the hearing before the RPD, it emerges that the applicant provided explanations addressing each of the deficiencies and inconsistencies perceived by the RPD. In particular, the applicant testified the following:
• Following discussions with other merchants from his neighbourhood on the threats and the extortion against him by the Maras 18, he attempted to form a merchants' association;
• He testified that he alone was explicitly targeted by the Maras 18 in the group, but that he had nevertheless succeeded in convincing the other merchants to unite since they were all at risk of being threatened by the Maras 18;
• In the beginning, five or six merchants were ready to commit with the applicant. Their objective was to go to the police station together three days later to report the Maras 18. The applicant explained that the merchants were afraid and that, in the end, when the time came for the association to meet, it was only the applicant and another merchant who came to the police station to file a report;
• The applicant explained that once he came to the police station, the police officer refused to accept his report since the person in charge was absent and that it was for that reason that he indicated at question 2(c) of his CRPF that he did not file a complaint with the police and that the police was not able to protect him;
• In response to this same question, the applicant also indicated that his friend Eleyo was killed by members of the Maras 18 after his report to the police.
[34]
The RPD is obligated to consider the explanations provided by the applicant which are not obviously implausible and to provide reasons "in clear and unmistakeable terms" so as to reject these explanations with respect to the whole of the evidence before it ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 9 and 20;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[35]
With respect to its reasons, the RPD did not support in clear and precise terms the basis of its rejection of the explanations provided by the applicant. Furthermore, the Court is of the view that the RPD's credibility findings are not anchored in the evidence in the record.
B.
Generalized risk
[36]
For the purposes of the analysis under section 97 of the IRPA, the applicant must establish that he is personally exposed to a risk that those living in the applicant's same country of origin or ordinary residence are not generally exposed to, independent of the fact that this personalized risk is shared by many (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[37]
Case law establishes a two-step analysis for the interpretation of paragraph 97(1)(
b
) of the IRPA. First, the RPD must characterize and describe the nature of the risk to which the applicant was exposed, then compare the nature and seriousness of the risk with that which a significant part of the population of the country is exposed. If the applicant's risk is distinct, he will then have the right to claim the protection of section 97 of the IRPA (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
[38]
According to the RPD file, the risk alleged by the applicant is the prospective risk of retaliation and threats to his life to which he is exposed because of the knowledge of the Maras 18 of the applicant's attempt to form a merchants' association in March 2014. At the hearing, the applicant testified that he was the only one among the merchants in the association who had been threatened and extorted, which places him plausibly outside the generalized risk to which are exposed the other merchants in his neighbourhood (RPD transcript, Tribunal Record, at p 210).
[39]
Moreover, in its reasons, the RPD characterized the risk to which the applicant is personally exposed as the risk of falling victim to extortion. This characterization led the RPD to find that the applicant is exposed to a generalized risk, similarly encountered by other Honduran merchants, thus excluding him from the definition of "person in need of protection" under paragraph 97(1)(
b
)(ii).
[40]
Therefore, while recognizing that the RPD's characterization of risk implicitly flows from previous credibility findings, the Court finds that the heart of the applicant's characterization of risk and of his claim are not reasonably analyzed by the RPD. In coming to a finding of generalized nature of risk feared by the applicant, the RPD unduly minimized the nature of the risk to which the refugee claimant was exposed.
[41]
According to case law, an individual who has been expressly targeted cannot then be considered to be exposed to a general risk ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 40).
[42]
In this case, there is an incongruity between the recognition by the RPD of the personalized nature of the risk experienced by the applicant and the conclusion that it is a generalized risk.
[43]
In this respect, the Court adopted the reasoning adopted by Justice Donald J. Rennie and by Justice Mary J. L. Gleason in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision at para 42:
[42] For example,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Rennie set aside the RPD's decision for being unreasonable because the RPD inappropriately characterized the nature of the risk faced by the claimant as the risk of gang violence. On the facts, the applicant and his family members were victims of extortion by the MS, one of his uncles had been killed by them, and the applicant received threats that his family would be killed should he fall short in making the extortion payments. Justice Rennie noted at para 13 that the evidence demonstrated that "the MS was specifically targeting the applicant to an extent beyond that experienced by the population at large." He continued at para 14:
[S]ection 97 must not be interpreted in a manner that strips it of any content or meaning. If any risk created by "criminal activity" is always considered a general risk, it is hard to fathom a scenario in which the requirements of section 97 would ever be met.
Instead of focusing on whether the risk is created by criminal activity, the Board must direct its attention to the question before it: whether the claimant would face a personal risk to his or her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and whether that risk is one not faced generally by other individuals in or from the country. Because the Board failed to properly undertake this inquiry in this case, the decision must be set aside
.
[Emphasis added.]
[44]
While recognizing that in case law the term "generally" may apply to a sub-group of the population (such as Honduran merchants), the Court adopts the reasoning made by Justice Gleason in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
It is simply untenable for the two statements of the Board to coexist: if an individual is subject to a
personal
risk to his life or risks cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, then that risk is no longer general. If the Board's reasoning is correct, it is unlikely that there would ever be a situation in which this section would provide protection for crime-related risks.
( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 36; see also:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
[45]
As expressed by Justice Russell Zinn in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : "where a person is specifically and personally targeted for death by a gang in circumstances where others are generally not, then he or she is entitled to protection under s. 97 of the Act if the other statutory requirements are met".
[46]
The tension between a personalized risk and a generalized risk was also expressed by Justice James Russell in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
While a full consensus has yet to emerge, I think that there is now a preponderance of authority from this Court that personal targeting, at least in many instances, distinguishes an individualized risk from a generalized risk, resulting in protection under s. 97(1)(b). Since "personal targeting" is not a precise term, and each case has its own unique facts, it may still be the case that "in some cases, personal targeting can ground protection, and in some it cannot" (
Rodriguez
, above, quoted with approval in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (2012)].
However, in my view there is an emerging consensus that it is not permissible to dismiss personal targeting as "merely an extension of," "implicit in" or "consequential harm resulting from" a generalized risk
. That is the main error committed by the RPD in this case, and it makes the Decision unreasonable.
[Emphasis added.]
[47]
Section 97 must not be interpreted in a manner that strips it of any content or meaning ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[48]
The Court found that with respect to its analysis under section 97 of the IRPA, the RPD did not reasonably weigh the evidence in support of the applicant's claim that he would be perceived by the Maras 18 as a threat to their authority for having created the merchants' association.
[49]
The
Response to Information Requests
HND104464.FE, contained in the RPD's national documentation package (NDP) (March 24, 2014), described the risk of retribution experienced by those who are perceived by Maras 18 as threats to their authority, including the merchants:
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that, following the imposition of a curfew by the maras in an area of Tegucigalpa, there were no complaints regarding threats from maras, and that the chief of police stated that "people may be keeping quiet out of fear" (4 Feb. 2013). La Prensa quotes a carrier from San Pedro Sula who stated that [translation]
"we are not filing reports because we do not know if the person whom we will report is an extortionist or a murderer" (La Prensa 7 May 2013). La Prensa also refers to the case of a merchant who was allegedly murdered by the maras less than 24 hours after reporting that he had been a victim of extortion (ibid.). The merchant's family stated that the gangs returned a few days after the funeral for the purposes of extortion, after having threatened to kill them (ibid.).
[Emphasis added.]
(Honduras: Areas where gangs operate (2012-June 2013), Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Ottawa, June 18, 2013, Tribunal Record at p 131)
[50]
Furthermore, the
Response to Information Requests
under HND103940.E of the NDP describes the retribution by the members of the Maras toward those who they consider are challenging their authority:
According to an article published by Agence France-Presse (AFP), the maras have divided Honduran cities into [translation] "zones or 'territories'" that are then disputed between M-18 and MS-13 (12 June 2011). Gutiérrez Rivera, writing in the
Bulletin of Latin American Research
in 2010, says that, in disputes over territory (also known as
rifa del barrio
), gangs "exercise and test territorial authority upon others," usually with violence, and retaliate to perceived challenges to their authority (2010, 499).
She explained that these territorial disputes are largely associated with the collection of [translation] "resources," such as the "war tax" on public transportation providers, kidnappings, threats and theft (25 Jan. 2012) from individuals and businesses
(Wilkinson 2010, 393). For example, Juan J. Fogelbach, a researcher at the US Office of Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations, indicates that, in recent years, there has been an increase in the burning of buses and the killing of bus drivers (2011, 438). He notes that the violence has been reported to be the means by which gangs "compel bus owners to make extortion payments" (Fogelbach 2011, 438). Additionally, Gutiérrez Rivera points out that gangs use violence to "impose local order" or "street level politics" (2010, 495).

X.
Conclusion
[51]
In light of the above, the Court finds that the RPD's decision that the applicant is not a person in need of protection is unreasonable.
[52]
The application is allowed and the matter is referred back to a differently constituted panel for a new hearing.
JUDGMENT
[53]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
this application for judicial review is allowed and that the file is referred back for re-determination by a differently constituted panel. No question is certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pas être interprété d'une manière qui le vide de son sens. Si un risque créé par une « activité criminelle » est toujours considéré comme un risque général, il est difficile de voir comment les exigences prévues à l'article 97 pourraient être satisfaites. Au lieu de mettre l'accent sur la question de savoir si le risque est créé par une activité criminelle, la Commission doit concentrer son attention sur la question dont elle est saisie: le demandeur serait-il exposé à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de subir des traitements et peines cruels et inusités à laquelle ou auquel les autres personnes qui vivent dans le pays ou qui sont originaires du pays ne sont pas exposées? Comme en l'espèce, la Commission ne s'est pas bien penchée sur cette question, la décision doit être annulée.

Introduction
[1]
Le juge Shore
: La Cour est saisie d'une demande en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, SC 2001, c 27 [LIPR] à l'encontre d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] rejetant la demande de statut de réfugié du demandeur en vertu des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR.
III.
Faits
[2]
Le demandeur est un commerçant et citoyen du Honduras.
[3]
Depuis le mois de février 2015, le demandeur exploitait un magasin de services de réparation de téléphones cellulaires dans la ville de Sigualtepeque, au Honduras.
[4]
Entre le 10 et le 22 mars 2014, le demandeur a été victime de menaces de mort et d'extorsion d'un « impôt de guerre » par des membres des Maras 18.
[5]
Le 21 mars 2014, le demandeur a discuté avec des commerçants de son quartier afin de former une association dans le but de résister aux Maras 18. À l'issue de ces discussions, le demandeur s'est présenté au poste de police accompagné d'un autre membre de l'association des commerçants, afin de porter plainte contre les Maras 18.
[6]
Le 9 avril 2014, un groupe des Maras 18 se sont présentés au magasin du demandeur cherchant à le tuer. Le demandeur était alors absent.
[7]
Craignant pour sa vie, le demandeur a quitté le Honduras le 20 avril 2014 et a présenté une demande d'asile à la frontière américano-canadienne le 3 juillet 2014.
[8]
Une audience a été tenue devant la SPR le 3 septembre 2014.
IV.
Décision contrôlée
[9]
Dans une décision datée du 19 septembre 2014, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'est pas une « personne à protéger » aux termes du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii) de la LIPR en raison de son manque de crédibilité et de la nature généralisée du risque auquel il est exposé.
A.
Crédibilité du demandeur
[10]
La SPR accepte que le demandeur exploitait un magasin de réparation de téléphones cellulaires entre février 2014 et avril 2014 et qu'il a été extorqué à trois reprises par les Maras 18 entre les 10 et 22 mars 2014.
[11]
Toutefois, la SPR rejette la prétention du demandeur selon laquelle il serait exposé à un risque personnalisé prévu à l'article 97 de la LIPR pour avoir créé une association de commerçants contre les Maras 18.
[12]
Plus précisément, la SPR détermine que:
[A]u fur et à mesure que le demandeur était confronté avec des questions, il inventait des réponses et s'enlisait davantage dans des contradictions. Le tribunal ne croit donc pas que les Maras 18 sont venus le chercher le 9 avril 2014 parce qu'ils se sont rendu compte qu'il avait proposé de créer une association afin de regrouper des commerçants contre les Maras 18 en allant chercher la protection policière.
(Décision de la SPR, au para 13)
B.
Risque généralisé
[13]
La SPR détermine que le demandeur est personnellement exposé à un risque prospectif d'extorsion. Or, la SPR conclut qu'il s'agit d'un risque généralisé qui s'apparente au même risque que celui auquel sont généralement exposés les commerçants honduriens.
V.
Provisions législatives
[14]
Les articles suivants de la LIPR s'appliquent à la détermination du statut de réfugié du demandeur:

(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
Convention refugee
96
. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(

Questions en litige
[15]
La demande présente les questions suivantes en litige:
a) Est-ce que les conclusions de crédibilité de la SPR sont raisonnables?
b) Est-ce que les conclusions de la SPR concernant le risque généralisé sont raisonnables?
VII.
Arguments des parties
A.
Arguments du demandeur
[16]
Le demandeur soutient que la SPR a tiré des conclusions déraisonnables en procédant à un examen microscopique de questions périphériques à la demande d'asile du demandeur (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[17]
Selon le demandeur, les conclusions de la SPR ne sont pas étayées par la preuve au dossier. Notamment, la SPR a erré en concluant que le demandeur a fourni un témoignage contradictoire quant à la création d'une association de commerçants contre les Maras 18.
[18]
Ensuite, le demandeur prétend qu'il est déraisonnable pour la SPR d'accepter, d'une part, que le demandeur soit personnellement ciblé par les Maras 18 en tant que commerçant et de conclure, d'autre part, que le risque auquel il est exposé soit un risque généralisé.
[19]
De plus, le demandeur reproche à la SPR d'avoir omis de considérer l'impact de son opposition aux Maras 18 à la lumière de la preuve documentaire, qui démontrent que les membres du Maras 18 ripostent violemment contre ceux qui contestent leur autorité.
[20]
Finalement, le demandeur soutient que la menace personnelle à la vie du demandeur n'a pas été raisonnablement examinée par la SPR.
B.
Arguments du défendeur
[21]
D'abord, le défendeur soutient que la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le demandeur n'est pas crédible quant à son risque prospectif allégué est raisonnable, compte tenu des contradictions dans la preuve du demandeur.
[22]
De plus, le défendeur prétend qu'il était loisible à la SPR de ne pas retenir les explications fournies par le demandeur lors de son témoignage.
[23]
Ensuite, le défendeur fait valoir qu'il est bien établi que les individus craignant d'être victimes d'extorsion ne sont pas des réfugiés au sens de la Convention. Il était raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que le risque allégué par le demandeur, c'est-à-dire d'être menacé, agressé et extorqué par des groupes criminalisés, s'insère dans le risque généralisé auquel sont exposés la plupart des citoyens du Honduras et plus particulièrement les propriétaires d'entreprises ou les commerçants.
VIII.
Norme de contrôle
[24]
Il est de jurisprudence constante que les questions relatives à la crédibilité, ainsi que celles relatives au risque généralisé, sont des questions de fait ou mixtes de fait et de droit assujetties à la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[25]
En conséquence, la Cour doit limiter son examen de la décision de la SPR à « la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 47).
IX.
Analyse
A.
Est-ce que les conclusions de crédibilité de la SPR sont raisonnables?
[26]
L'évaluation de la crédibilité du demandeur est au cœur de la compétence de la SPR, qui est la mieux placée pour apprécier les témoignages et la preuve, dans leur ensemble (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Dans cette vue, il n'appartient pas à la Cour de substituer son opinion pour les conclusions de crédibilité de la SPR (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 59).
[27]
Ensuite, les incohérences mineures ou secondaires contenues dans la preuve du demandeur ne devraient pas inciter la SPR à conclure à une absence générale de crédibilité du demandeur si la preuve documentaire confirme la vraisemblance de son récit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[28]
En l'espèce, la SPR conclut que le demandeur n'est pas crédible relativement à sa crainte d'être personnellement visé de représailles par les Maras 18 pour avoir tenté de former une association de commerçants (décision de la SPR, aux para 6 à 13).
[29]
Premièrement, la SPR rejette le témoignage du demandeur relativement à la date de formation et à la composition de l'association des commerçants. Selon la SPR, le demandeur a témoigné de façon incohérente quant au moment exact où la décision de former l'association et de porter plainte à la police a été prise. De plus, la SPR semble tirer une inférence négative du fait qu'ultimement, quatre des commerçants ne se sont jamais présentés pour accompagner le demandeur afin de soumettre une plainte à la police.
[30]
Deuxièmement, la SPR soulève des doutes quant aux circonstances entourant la dénonciation présentée à la police par le demandeur. Notamment, la SPR observe que, d'une part, le demandeur a prétendu ne pas avoir déposé une dénonciation à la police pour le motif que la personne responsable était absente mais que, d'autre part, le demandeur a indiqué à la question 2c) de son Formulaire de demande d'asile [FDA] qu'il n'a pas dénoncé l'extorsion dont il a été victime, car la police n'était pas en mesure de le protéger.
[31]
Ces constats mènent la SPR à conclure que le demandeur inventait des réponses au fur et à mesure qu'il était confronté à des questions, minant ainsi sa crédibilité.
[32]
Suite à une lecture approfondie du dossier ayant été porté devant la SPR et du procès-verbal d'audience, la Cour constate que les conclusions défavorables concernant la crédibilité du demandeur de la SPR sont problématiques à certains égards.
[33]
Il se dégage du procès-verbal d'audience devant la SPR que le demandeur a fourni des explications adressant chacune des lacunes et des incohérences perçues par la SPR. Notamment, le demandeur a témoigné ce qui suit:
• Suite à des discussions avec d'autres commerçants de son quartier relativement aux menaces et à l'extorsion dont il a été victime par les Maras 18, il a tenté de former une association de commerçants;
• Il a témoigné que lui seul était explicitement visé par les Maras 18 dans le groupe, mais qu'il avait néanmoins réussi à convaincre les autres commerçants de s'unir puisqu'ils étaient tous à risque d'être menacés par les Maras 18;
• Au départ, cinq ou six commerçants étaient prêts à s'engager avec le demandeur. Leur objectif était de se présenter ensemble au poste de police trois jours plus tard afin de dénoncer les Maras 18. le demandeur a expliqué que les commerçants ont eu peur et qu'ultimement, lorsque le moment est venu pour l'association de se rencontrer, ce n'est que le demandeur et un autre commerçant qui se sont présentés au poste de police afin de déposer une dénonciation;
• Le demandeur a expliqué qu'une fois rendu au poste de police, le policier a refusé d'accepter sa dénonciation puisque la personne responsable était absente et que c'est pour cette raison qu'il a indiqué, à la question 2c) de son FDA qu'il n'avait pas soumis de plainte à la police et que la police n'était pas en mesure de le protéger;
• En réponse à cette même question, le demandeur a également indiqué que son ami Eleyo avait été assassiné par des membres des Maras 18 suite à son acte de dénonciation à la police.
[34]
La SPR a l'obligation de considérer les explications fournies par le demandeur qui ne sont pas manifestement invraisemblables et de formuler des motifs « en termes clairs et explicites » afin de rejeter ces explications au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve dont elle dispose ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus aux para 9 et 20;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[35]
Au regard de ses motifs, la SPR n'a pas étayé en termes clairs et précis le fondement de son rejet des explications fournies par le demandeur. De plus, la Cour est d'avis que les conclusions de crédibilité de la SPR ne sont pas ancrées dans la preuve au dossier.
B.
Risque généralisé
[36]
Aux fins de l'analyse en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR, le demandeur doit établir qu'il est personnellement exposé à un risque auquel ne sont généralement pas exposés ceux vivant dans le même pays d'origine ou de résidence régulière du demandeur, et ce, indépendamment du fait que ce risque personnalisé soit partagé par plusieurs (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[37]
La jurisprudence établit une analyse en deux étapes aux fins d'interprétation de l'alinéa 97(1)
b
) de la LIPR. D'abord, la SPR doit qualifier et décrire la nature du risque auquel est exposé le demandeur, pour ensuite comparer la nature et la gravité du risque avec celui auquel est exposée une partie importante de la population du même pays. Si le risque auquel est exposé le demandeur est distinct, il aura alors le droit de se réclamer de la protection de l'article 97 de la LIPR (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[38]
Il se dégage du dossier de la SPR que le risque allégué par le demandeur est le risque prospectif de représailles et de menace à sa vie auquel il est exposé en raison de la prise de connaissance des Maras 18 de la tentative du demandeur de former une association de commerçants en mars 2014. À l'audience, le demandeur a témoigné qu'il était le seul d'entre les commerçants de l'association qui avait été menacé et extorqué, ce qui le place vraisemblablement en dehors du risque généralisé auquel sont exposés les autres commerçants de son quartier (procès-verbal de la SPR, Dossier du Tribunal, à la p 210).
[39]
Or, dans ses motifs, la SPR qualifie le risque auquel est personnellement exposé le demandeur comme étant le risque d'être victime d'extorsion. Cette qualification mène la SPR à conclure que le demandeur est exposé à un risque généralisé, similairement encouru par les autres commerçants honduriens, l'excluant ainsi de la définition de « personne à protéger » sous le sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii).
[40]
Par conséquent, tout en reconnaissant que la qualification du risque par la SPR découle implicitement de ses conclusions de crédibilité antérieures, la Cour estime que le nœud de la qualification du risque du demandeur ainsi que le nœud de sa revendication n'ont pas été raisonnablement analysés par la SPR. Afin de conclure à la nature généralisée du risque appréhendé par le demandeur, la SPR a indûment minimisé la nature du risque auquel le demandeur d'asile était exposé.
[41]
Il se dégage de la jurisprudence qu'un individu ayant été expressément ciblé ne peut être ensuite considéré comme étant exposé à un risque général ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au para 40).
[42]
En l'espèce, il y a une incongruité entre la reconnaissance par la SPR du caractère personnalisé du risque encouru par le demandeur et la conclusion selon laquelle il s'agit d'un risque généralisé.
[43]
À cet égard, la Cour adopte le raisonnement adopté par le juge Donald J. Rennie, et par la juge Mary J. L. Gleason dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au para 42:
[42] Par exemple, dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Rennie a annulé la décision de la SPR au motif qu'elle était déraisonnable étant donné que la SPR avait mal qualifié le risque auquel le demandeur était exposé en concluant que le demandeur était exposé à la violence des gangs. Or, il ressortait des faits que le demandeur et les membres de sa famille avaient été victimes d'extorsion de la part de la MS, qu'un de ses oncles avait été tué par la MS et que ce gang avait menacé de tuer les membres de sa famille s'il refusait d'obtempérer aux demandes d'argent. Le juge Rennie a fait observer, au paragraphe 13, qu'il ressortait de la preuve que « la MS visait le demandeur dans une mesure plus importante que la population en général ». Il a poursuivi en écrivant, au paragraphe 14:
Comme il a été souligné dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'article 97 ne doit pas être interprété d'une manière qui le vide de son sens. Si un risque créé par une « activité criminelle » est toujours considéré comme un risque général, il est difficile de voir comment les exigences prévues à l' article 97 pourraient être satisfaites.
Au lieu de mettre l'accent sur la question de savoir si le risque est créé par une activité criminelle, la Commission doit concentrer son attention sur la question dont elle est saisie: le demandeur serait-il exposé à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de subir des traitements et peines cruels et inusités à laquelle ou auquel les autres personnes qui vivent dans le pays ou qui sont originaires du pays ne sont pas exposées? Comme en l'espèce, la Commission ne s'est pas bien penchée sur cette question, la décision doit être annulée.
[Je souligne.]
[44]
Tout en reconnaissant que dans la jurisprudence le terme « généralement » peut s'appliquer à un sous-groupe de la population (tel que les commerçants honduriens), la Cour souscrit au raisonnement suivi par la juge Gleason dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , selon lequel:
Les deux affirmations que la Commission fait sont tout simplement incompatibles: si une personne est exposée à une menace
personnelle
à sa vie ou au risque de subir des peines ou traitements cruels et inusités, ce risque n'est plus un risque général. Si le raisonnement de la Commission est juste, il est peu probable qu'il existe des situations dans lesquelles cet article permettrait à quiconque d'être protégé des risques liés à la criminalité.
( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 36; voir également:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
[45]
Tel qu'exprimé par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « lorsqu'une personne risque expressément et personnellement d'être tuée par un gang dans des circonstances où d'autres personnes ne sont généralement pas exposées à ce risque, elle a droit à la protection de l'article 97 de la Loi si les autres exigences légales sont remplies ».
[46]
La tension entre un risque personnalisé et un risque généralisé a également été exprimée par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Bien qu'un consensus ne se soit pas encore dégagé, j'estime que, suivant la jurisprudence dominante de notre Cour, le fait d'avoir personnellement été pris pour cible permet, du moins dans de nombreux cas, de dégager l'existence d'un risque individualisé plutôt qu'un risque généralisé, donnant lieu à la protection prévue à l'alinéa 97(1)
b)
. Étant donné que « pris personnellement pour cible » est une notion qui demeure imprécise et que chaque cas est un cas d'espèce, il est encore possible que « dans certains cas, il y [ait] lieu d'accorder une protection lorsque quelqu'un est pris pour cible, dans d'autres, non » (
Rodriguez
, précitée, cité avec approbation dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (2012)].
Toutefois, à mon avis, il existe un consensus de plus en plus généralisé voulant qu'il ne soit pas permis d'écarter le cas où le demandeur a été pris personnellement pour cible au motif qu'il s'agit du « simple prolongement », d'une « composante implicite », ou d'un « préjudice résultant » d'un risque généralisé.
C'est la principale erreur qu'a commise la SPR dans le cas qui nous occupe et cette erreur rend sa décision déraisonnable.
[Je souligne.]
[47]
L'article 97 ne doit pas être interprété d'une manière qui le vide de son sens ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus au para 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[48]
La Cour conclut qu'au regard de son analyse en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR, la SPR n'a pas raisonnablement soupesé la preuve au soutien de la prétention du demandeur selon laquelle il serait perçu par les Maras 18 comme étant une menace à leur autorité pour avoir créé l'association des commerçants.
[49]
La
Réponse aux demandes d'information
HND104464.F, figurant dans le cartable de documentation nationale de la SPR [CND] (24 mars 2014), décrit le risque de représailles encouru par ceux qui sont perçus par le Maras 18 comme des menaces à leur autorité, incluant les commerçants:
L'Agence France-Presse (AFP) signale qu'à la suite de l'imposition par les maras d'un couvre-feu dans une zone de Tegucigalpa, il n'y a pas eu de plaintes concernant les menaces des maras, et que le chef de la police a affirmé que [traduction] « peut-être que les habitants demeurent silencieux parce qu'ils ont peur » (4 fév. 2013).
La Prensa
cite un transporteur de San Pedro Sulaqui dit que [traduction]
« "[o]n ne dénonce pas parce qu'on ne sait pas si la personne qu'on va dénoncer fait de l'extorsion ou commet des meurtres" » (
La Prensa
7 mai 2013).
La Prensa
cite également le cas d'un commerçant qui aurait été assassiné par les maras moins de 24 heures après avoir dénoncé le fait qu'il était victime d'extorsion (ibid.). La famille du commerçant a affirmé que les gangs sont revenus quelques jours après les obsèques pour les extorquer après leur avoir fait des menaces de mort (ibid.).

[50]
De plus, la
Réponse aux demandes d'information
sous la cote HND103940.EF du CND décrit les ripostes exercées par les membres des Maras envers ceux qu'ils considèrent être des contestations à leur autorité:
D'après un article publié par l'Agence France-Presse (AFP), les maras ont divisé les villes du Honduras en [traduction] « zones ou "territoires" » pour lesquels s'affrontent ensuite la M-18 et la MS-13 (12 juin 2011). En 2010, Mme Gutiérrez Rivera a écrit dans le
Bulletin of Latin American Research
que, lors de conflits territoriaux (aussi connus sous le nom de
rifa del barrio
), les gangs [traduction] « exercent et mesurent leur autorité territoriale sur les autres », habituellement avec violence, en plus de riposter à ce qu'ils considèrent être des contestations de leur autorité (2010, 499).
Elle a expliqué que ces conflits territoriaux sont grandement associés à la perception de [traduction] « ressources », comme la « "taxe de guerre" » auprès des fournisseurs de transport public, ainsi qu'à des enlèvements, des menaces et des vols (25 janv. 2012) visant des particuliers et des entreprises
(Wilkinson 2010, 393). Juan J. Fogelbach, chercheur à la Direction des réfugiés, de l'asile et des opérations internationales (Office of Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations) des États-Unis affirme d'ailleurs qu'au cours des dernières années, il y a eu une augmentation du nombre d'incendies d'autobus et de meurtres de chauffeurs (2011, 438). Il souligne que les gangs auraient recours à la violence pour [traduction] « forc[er] les propriétaires d'autobus à leur verser de l'argent » (Fogelbach 2011, 438). Mme Gutiérrez Rivera fait remarquer qu'ils usent de violence pour [traduction] « imposer un ordre local [ou] des politiques de rue » (2010, 495).
