I.
The nature of the matter
[1]
Locke, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, dated August 2, 2013, rejecting the applicants' claim for refugee protection and determining that they were neither "Convention refugees" nor "persons in need of protection". The applicants submit that the RPD assessed their credibility in an unreasonable manner.
[2]
For the reasons set out in the analysis which follows, the application for judicial review is dismissed.
II.
The facts
[3]
Aline Ngendankazi (the female applicant) is a citizen of Burundi and a survivor of the conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in 1993 during which many Tutsis were persecuted and killed. According to her testimony, she was also an activist for the AC-Génocide association until 2010.
[4]
The evidence adduced shows that inter-ethnic tensions remain very present in Burundi. The army and police, comprised of both Hutus and Tutsis, instill less fear that before, but they do not inspire the people's confidence. Moreover, the Service national de renseignement (SNR) [National Intelligence Service] continues to sow fear throughout the country, as it is considered corrupt and ineffective.
[5]
On January 27, 2013, a violent fire tore through the central market in Bujumbura. It was widely rumoured that the fire had been deliberately set. In the aftermath of the fire, a commission of inquiry was held, whose report was made public. The commission determined that the fire was caused by human error rather than arson. The cause of the fire remains nebulous and the report's validity has been questioned. One of the theories rejected by the commission involved the use of fire-accelerant powder.
[6]
On January 30, 2013, the female applicant went to a shop owned by her friend, Ali Somji. While she was there, he confided in her that he had sold some flammable powder used to destroy expired medication to an SNR officer. Mr. Somji purportedly told the female applicant that he believed the powder had been used in the fire and that, after the incident, SNR officers stopped returning his calls.
[7]
On February 3, 2013, M. Somji was found murdered in his shop. On the premises, the female applicant encountered officers from the SNR. Two days later, the female applicant was questioned about her friend's death and then released.
[8]
On February 7, 2013, the female applicant allegedly received an anonymous call threatening her sons with death in the event she was to do anything to destabilise those in power.
[9]
On February 15, 2013, the tires of the female applicant's car were slashed.
[10]
On February 28, 2013, some SNR officers reportedly went to the female applicant's home to question her maid about the family's daily routine.
[11]
On March 14, 2013, the female applicant and her two sons (the male applicants) claim that they were nearly struck by an SNR pickup truck. Following that, the female applicant's sons stayed with their grandfather temporarily for their safety. As for herself, the female applicant found temporary refuge in three different places, namely: Ngagara, Mutanga-Sud and Nyakabiga.
[12]
Later, the female applicant, fearing for her life, obtained a visa from the United States. On April 30, 2013, the applicants arrived in the United States. On May 12, 2013, they arrived in Canada and claimed refugee protection.
[13]
The applicants fear being killed by the regime in power if they were to return to Burundi; this is based on information the female applicant has regarding the fire in the market.
III.
The RPD decision
[14]
The RPD rejected the refugee protection claim by reason of the applicants' credibility. The RPD submits, in particular, that the applicants had not adequately discharged their burden of establishing that there was a serious risk of persecution or that they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to their country.
[15]
The RPD's decision is based entirely on the lack of credibility of the female applicant's testimony. The RPD drew negative inferences based on the following:
1. The female applicant hesitated when she was asked about the family of Mr. Somji, a man whom she described as a long-time friend. The female applicant hesitated when the RPD asked her what the name of her friend's spouse was before finally stating that her name was Assina. Furthermore, the female applicant did not know either the names or ages of her friend's children. She had never met Mr. Somji's family.
2. While in her written testimony the female applicant characterized Mr. Somji as a long-time friend, during her examination she stated that she had maintained a business relationship with him.
3. The female applicant indicated having met Mr. Somji's cousins and brothers on February 4, 2013. When the RPD asked her how she knew they were his cousins and brothers, she replied that she had met them before, thus adjusting her testimony.
4. The female applicant did not provide any documentary evidence of her relationship with Mr. Somji.
5. The female applicant was unable to say how the SNR had learned of the revelations that had been made to her by Mr. Somji. She mentioned that she had not revealed the contents of the conversation to the SNR but in her Basis of Claim form she stated that she [translation] "had alluded to Mr. Somji's concerns". The female applicant has not clearly established that the authorities are aware of what Mr. Somji reportedly told her. In addition, the RPD did not believe the female applicant when she indicated that [translation] "alluding" to his concerns in the presence of the SNR officers meant that she had been thinking about his concerns without mentioning them.
6. Information that a white powder may have been used as an accelerant and that Mr. Somji may have been murdered as a result of the provenance of the powder was widely known. Accordingly, the female applicant's explanation that she would be in danger due to this information, which had already been made public, was not accepted by the RPD.
7. Counsel for the female applicant submitted that it was not known whether members of Mr. Somji's family had had problems with the authorities. Given the media exposure of the matter, the RPD found that it would be reasonable to expect that if the family had been killed, the documentary evidence in the record would include some reference to it. Thus, in the RPD's view, it is surprising that the female applicant would be in danger when there was nothing to indicate that Mr. Somji's family was at risk.
8. The female applicant wrote in her Personal Information Form that the authorities were searching for anyone who had contact with Ali Somji before his death. When asked about this assertion, the female applicant explained that she was referring to herself.
9. The female applicant was hesitant during her testimony with respect to what measures she had taken to protect her children. The female applicant mentioned that she had taken them to their grandfather's, a five-minute drive from the applicants' residence, which is surprising in light of her fear of the SNR. The female applicant did not change her telephone number. In that regard she claims that she wanted to show that she had nothing to hide. The RPD relied on the conduct of the female applicant to make adverse findings as to the validity of her fear.
10. The female applicant testified that from January 2006 to January 2010 she had had problems with the authorities due to her involvement with AC-Génocide. Her counsel submits that this fact is indicative of the authorities wanting to go after her in relation to allegations made about the fire at Bujumbura's market. However, the female applicant testified that she had ceased participating in that association in 2010. There had been no conflict between her and the authorities from 2010 to 2013.
11. The female applicant told border services officers that she would return to Burundi once she had her Canadian papers, which is inconsistent with the conduct of someone whose life is in danger.
12. The female applicant's spouse continues to live and work in the places that were visited by the SNR, the same entity that had allegedly threatened and tried to kill his wife and children.
IV.
Issues
[16]
Numerous issues were raised in the female applicant's memorandum; these may be summarized as follows:
1. Did the RPD err in its assessment of the female applicant's credibility?
2. Did the RPD err in its assessment of the objective fear of persecution?
For the purposes of this decision, the analysis of these two issues may be grouped under a single analysis, namely, that of credibility.
3. Did the RPD properly consider the cumulative effect of the incidents?
V.
Analysis
A.
Applicable standard of review
[17]
A standard of reasonableness is applicable to the assessment of credibility and of well founded objective fear of persecution (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Su
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[18]
The issue of whether the RPD ought to have considered the cumulative effect of the incidents is reviewable on a correctness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
B.
Credibility analysis
[19]
The role of the Court is limited with respect to findings of credibility "because the tribunal had the advantage of hearing the witnesses testify, observed their demeanor and is alive to all the factual nuances and contradictions in the evidence" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[20]
First, the RPD's decision to draw a negative inference from the female applicant's difficulty describing the nature of her relationship with Mr. Somji and providing details about his children is reasonable.
[21]
In her written testimony justifying her claim for refugee protection, the female applicant stated: [translation] "I was called by a long-time friend of Indian origin named Ali Somji". Questioned by the RPD, the female applicant added that he was [translation] "really more of a business friend". The female applicant did not know the names of Mr. Somji's children and, according to the RPD, hesitated as to the name of his wife. The RPD is entitled to take into account a witnesses' demeanour, including hesitations, vagueness and changing or elaborating on their versions of events. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 45).
[22]
It is true that the female applicant's testimony as a whole shows that she knew Mr. Somji's business habits, the date of his funeral, the customs that were practised at the funeral, the frequency of their meetings, his nationality and the approximate ages of his children. However, even if I were to acknowledge the existence of a business relationship between the female applicant and Mr. Somji, and that the credibility of her testimony was affected by cultural components, as counsel for the female applicant submits, I am of the view that it is reasonable to believe that the nature of this relationship does not support a finding that she was a privileged confidante of Mr. Somji, a man whose life was in danger.
[23]
The female applicant's testimony leaves no doubt that she had a solid relationship with Mr. Somji, but it is not enough to undermine the overall reasonableness of the RPD's findings. The RPD was not satisfied that there was enough evidence to support a conclusion that the female applicant and Mr. Somji had been close enough for Mr. Somji to reveal sensitive information to her. In my opinion, the RPD's findings in this regard are reasonable.
[24]
Second, I am of the view that the RPD reasonably found the female applicant's testimony with regard to the persecution she was allegedly the victim of to be contradictory and inconsistent.
[25]
It is reasonable to draw a negative inference from the fact that the female applicant was unable to provide a clear explanation of the reasons for her persecution. She asserted that she could be persecuted on the basis of her past as an activist. However, when asked about this by the RPD, she stated that since September 2010 she had not had [translation] "any further problems [because she had] ceased participating in the activities of AC-Génocide". The female applicant affirmed that she could be persecuted because she had witnessed the fire firsthand and had been a close confidante of Mr. Somji's. However, the possibility that a chemical powder had contributed to the spread of the fire was common knowledge. The female applicant cannot be a privileged witness as even Mr. Somji did not have privileged information regarding the fact that the powder he had sold might have been used in the fire in the Bujumbura market. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to the effect that the SNR suspected the female applicant of having privileged information.
[26]
The female applicant claims to be persecuted and that she cannot find refuge anywhere in the country, yet her husband remains there and works in the same places that were visited by the SNR, even after she had shared Mr. Somji's secret suspicions with him.
[27]
In addition, there is no indication that the family of Mr. Somji has been persecuted. Yet it would be reasonable to suppose that the female applicant, upon seeing her life threatened, would have at least tried to find out if the family of her long-time friend had also been persecuted.
[28]
The jurisprudence of this Court has established that discrepancies between various versions of events afforded by a claimant provide a solid basis for adverse credibility findings (
Su
at paragraph 8; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 43). Drawing a negative inference from the aforementioned factual contradictions does not strike me as unreasonable.
[29]
Lastly, the female applicant mentioned that she would return to Burundi once she had received her papers from Canada, but that she did not intend to return there for now. Overall, it seems reasonable to me to conclude that an individual seeking to flee certain death would not suggest to a border services officer that they were considering returning to their country once under Canada's protection. Even taking into account that she merely wished to indicate her desire to return to Burundi one day, the fact that she would consider this option barely one month after leaving the country of persecution does not weigh in her favour.
[30]
Counsel for the female applicant submits that the RPD failed to consider Burundi's political context. First, the case law has established that it does not matter "if the RPD's reasons are not perfect or even if the Court agrees with the conclusion, let alone each step of the RPD's credibility analysis" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 60). For example, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 34, the Honourable Justice Shore noted that the RPD's credibility findings ought to have considered the context of the country condition evidence, but nonetheless determined that RPD had reasonably found it implausible that the applicant would have kissed another man in a heterosexual nightclub knowing he could be imprisoned or executed for it. Second, all of the evidence in the record shows that the RPD made sure it understood the female applicant's explanations, questioning her several times about the political motive that might be behind the persecution of which she claimed to be a victim, but she was unable to provide a satisfactory answer.
C.
Cumulative effect of the incidents
[31]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 42, the Federal Court of Appeal provides guidance on the cumulative effect of incidents:
These authorities make clear that the Board is duty bound to consider all of the events which may have an impact on a claimant's claim that he or she has a well founded fear of persecution, including those events which, if taken individually, do not amount to persecution, but if taken together, may justify a claim to a well founded fear of persecution.
[32]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 25, Justice Teitelbaum explains the application of the standard determined by the Federal Court of Appeal:
I am mindful of the high standard established by the Federal Court of Appeal with regard to the Board's analysis of the cumulative effects of refugee claimants' experiences: it must be more than a reasonable assessment of the circumstances - it must be correct. In this case, I am satisfied that the Board was, in fact, mindful of all aspects of the Applicants' various claims, how they had impacted them, and how they might affect the Applicants should they return to Mexico. The Board's failure to couch the analysis in terms of a "cumulative" approach does not betray an incorrect analysis. The Board clearly considered all of the events described by the Applicants, both individually and as a group. I can see no basis, therefore, for overturning the Board's decision on these grounds.
[33]
The female applicant argues that the cumulative effects of the acts of which she was a victim must be taken into consideration, namely, her detention for four days in 2006 by reason of her activism, the slashed tires of her car, the SNR's alleged attempt to run over her children with a pickup truck and her overall dealings with the SNR. However, after having read the record in its entirety, it appears to me that the RPD questioned the female applicant about all of the instances in which she claimed to have been persecuted and attempted to reconcile the various parts of her testimony. The following passage from the hearing transcript shows that the RPD tied various parts of her testimony together:
[translation]
Q: You were arrested in 2006, according to your ...the information you provided in your BoC. Following the arrest in 2006, did you have any further problems with the authorities prior to the issue about the fire?
A: I had no further problems because, well, since September 2010, I had ceased all participation in AC-Génocide activities.
Q: Do you have any proof, or evidence of your business connections or your friendship with Ali Somji?
A: I do not.
[34]
The fact that the RPD drew negative inferences about the female applicant's credibility does not mean that her allegations were not considered cumulatively.
[35]
In conclusion, the female applicant has not succeeded in demonstrating that the RPD's decision was unreasonable. Although the RPD's decision is imperfect, the fact remains that its findings with respect to the credibility of the female applicant are reasonable. Moreover, the record and the decision indicate that all of the incidents were taken into consideration.

1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
2. There is no serious question of general importance to certify.

Aline Ngendankazi, O'Neal Nesta  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Locke
: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, en vertu du paragraphe 72 (1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, SC 2001, c 27 (
LIPR
), de la décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada, rendue le 2 août 2013, rejetant la demande d'asile des demandeurs et concluant que ceux-ci n'ont pas la qualité de « réfugié[e] s au sens de la Convention » ni celle de « personne à protéger ». Les demandeurs soutiennent que la SPR a évalué leur crédibilité de manière déraisonnable.
[2]
En raison de l'analyse qui suit, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
II.
Les faits
[3]
Aline Ngendankazi (la demanderesse) est une citoyenne du Burundi et une survivante du conflit entre Hutus et Tutsis de 1993 au cours duquel de nombreux de Tutsis ont été persécutés et ont perdu la vie. Selon son témoignage, celle-ci a également été une militante pour l'association AC-Génocide jusqu'en 2010.
[4]
La preuve soumise démontre que les tensions interethniques sont toujours très présentes au Burundi. L'armée et la police, constituées à la fois de Hutus et de Tutsis, suscitent moins la crainte qu'auparavant, mais n'inspirent pas la confiance de la population. De plus, le Service national de renseignement (SNR) continue de générer de la peur au sein du pays, celui-ci étant considéré comme corrompu et inefficace.
[5]
Le 27 janvier 2013, le marché central de Bujumbura a été proie à un violent incendie. Il circulait dans l'opinion publique que cet incendie était d'origine criminelle. Suite à l'incendie, une commission d'enquête s'est tenue, dont le rapport est public. Cette commission a privilégié l'hypothèse d'un incendie causé par une cause humaine fortuite et non criminelle. La cause de cet incendie reste nébuleuse et la validité du rapport est contestée. L'une des théories avancée, mais rejetée par la commission d'enquête concerne l'utilisation d'une poudre ayant accéléré l'incendie.
[6]
Le 30 janvier 2013, la demanderesse s'est rendue au commerce de son ami, Ali Somji. Une fois sur place, celui-ci lui aurait confié qu'il avait vendu une poudre inflammable destinée à détruire des médicaments périmés à un agent du SNR. M. Somji aurait confié à la demanderesse qu'il croyait que la poudre avait été utilisée dans l'incendie et que, suite à cet événement, les agents du SNR ont cessé de répondre à ses appels.
[7]
Le 3 février 2013, M. Somji a été retrouvé assassiné dans son commerce. Sur les lieux, la demanderesse a rencontré des agents du SNR. Deux jours plus tard, la demanderesse a été questionnée relativement à la mort de son ami, puis elle a été relâchée.
[8]
Le 7 février 2013, la demanderesse aurait reçu un appel anonyme menaçant ses fils de mort dans l'éventualité où elle poserait un acte de déstabilisation du pouvoir.
[9]
Le 15 février 2013, les pneus de la voiture de la demanderesse ont été crevés.
[10]
Le 28 février 2013, des agents du SNR seraient venus à la maison de la demanderesse afin de questionner le domestique de celle-ci sur la routine familiale.
[11]
Le 14 mars 2013, la demanderesse et ses deux fils (les demandeurs) affirment avoir été presque renversés par une camionnette du SNR. Par la suite, les fils de la demanderesse ont vécu temporairement chez leur grand-père afin d'assurer leur sécurité. Quant à elle, la demanderesse s'est réfugiée temporairement à trois différents endroits soit: Ngagara, Mutanga-sud et Nyakabiga.
[12]
Par la suite, la demanderesse, craignant pour sa vie, a obtenu un visa des États-Unis. Le 30 avril 2013, les demandeurs sont arrivés aux États-Unis. Le 12 mai 2013, ils arrivèrent au Canada et présentèrent une demande d'asile.
[13]
Les demandeurs craignent d'être tués par le régime au pouvoir dans l'éventualité de leur retour au Burundi et cela en raison des informations que détient la demanderesse sur l'incendie du marché.
III.
La décision de la SPR
[14]
La SPR a rejeté la demande en raison du manque de crédibilité des demandeurs. La SPR soutient notamment que les demandeurs ne se sont pas adéquatement déchargés du fardeau qui leur incombait d'établir une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ou qu'ils seraient personnellement exposés à un risque de torture, à une menace à leur vie ou à de traitements cruels et inusités, s'ils retournaient dans leur pays.
[15]
La décision de la SPR repose entièrement sur l'absence de crédibilité du témoignage de la demanderesse. La SPR a tiré des inférences négatives des éléments suivants:
1. La demanderesse a hésité lorsqu'elle a été questionnée sur la famille de M. Somji, un homme qu'elle qualifie d'ami de longue date. La demanderesse a hésité lorsque la SPR l'a questionné sur le nom de l'épouse de son ami avant de finalement dire qu'elle se nommait Assina. De plus, la demanderesse ne connaissait ni le nom ni l'âge des enfants de son ami. Elle n'a jamais rencontré la famille de M. Somji.
2. Alors que dans son témoignage écrit la demanderesse a présenté M. Somji comme étant son ami de longue date, celle-ci a mentionné qu'elle entretenait une relation d'affaires avec lui lors de son interrogatoire.
3. La demanderesse a indiqué qu'elle avait rencontré des cousins et des frères de M. Somji le 4 février 2013. Lorsque la SPR lui a demandé comment elle avait su qu'il s'agissait de ses cousins et ses frères, elle a répondu qu'elle les avait rencontrés auparavant, rajustant ainsi son témoignage.
4. La demanderesse n'a pas fourni de preuve documentaire de sa relation avec M. Somji.
5. La demanderesse ne pouvait indiquer de quelle façon le SNR a été mis au courant des révélations qui lui avaient été faites par M. Somji. Celle-ci a mentionné qu'elle n'a pas révélé le contenu de sa conversation aux agents du SNR alors qu'elle avait mentionné dans son formulaire de fondement de la demande d'asile qu'elle « avait fait allusion aux inquiétudes de M. Somji ». La demanderesse n'a pas établi de façon claire que les autorités sont au courant de ce que M. Somji lui aurait dit. De plus, la SPR n'a pas cru la demanderesse quand elle a indiqué que « faire allusion » à ses inquiétudes devant les agents du SNR veut dire qu'elle pensait à ses inquiétudes sans les avoir mentionnées.
6. L'information voulant qu'une poudre blanche a peut-être été utilisée pour propager l'incendie et que M. Somji a peut-être été assassiné en raison de l'origine de la poudre était de notoriété publique. En conséquence, l'explication de la demanderesse voulant qu'elle soit en danger en raison de cette information déjà rendue publique n'a pas été retenue par la SPR.
7. L'avocat de la demanderesse a fait valoir qu'on ne savait pas si les membres de la famille de M. Somji ont eu des problèmes avec les autorités. Compte tenu de l'aspect médiatique de l'affaire, la SPR juge qu'il est raisonnable de penser que si la famille avait été tuée, la preuve documentaire au dossier en ferait mention. Ainsi, selon la SPR, il est étonnant que la demanderesse soit en danger alors que rien n'indique que la famille de M. Somji ne le soit.
8. La demanderesse a écrit dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels que les autorités sont à la recherche de tous les contacts qu'Ali Somji aurait eus avant sa mort. Questionnée au sujet de cette affirmation, la demanderesse précisa qu'il s'agissait d'elle-même.
9. La demanderesse a été hésitante lors de son témoignage quant aux mesures qu'elle a prises pour protéger ses enfants. La demanderesse a mentionné qu'elle avait caché ses enfants chez leur grand-père à cinq minutes en voiture de la résidence des demandeurs, ce qui est étonnant considérant sa crainte du SNR. La demanderesse n'a pas changé de numéro de téléphone. Elle allègue à ce sujet qu'elle voulait démontrer qu'elle n'avait rien à cacher. La SPR s'appuie sur le comportement de la demanderesse pour en tirer des conclusions défavorables quant à la validité de sa crainte.
10. La demanderesse a témoigné que de janvier 2006 à janvier 2010 elle avait eu des problèmes avec les autorités en raison de son implication dans AC-Génocide. Son avocat soutient que ce fait indique que les autorités veulent s'en prendre à elle relativement aux allégations présentées en lien avec l'incendie du marché de Bujumbura. Cependant, la demanderesse a témoigné qu'elle a cessé sa participation dans cette association en 2010. Elle n'a pas eu de conflit avec les autorités de 2010 à 2013.
11. La demanderesse a déclaré aux agents des services frontaliers qu'elle retournerait au Burundi lorsqu'elle aura les ses papiers canadiens, ce qui est incompatible avec le comportement d'un individu dont la vie est en danger.
12. Le mari de la demanderesse continue de demeurer et de travailler dans les lieux qui ont été visités par le SNR, la même entité qui aurait menacé et tenté de tuer sa femme et ses enfants.
IV.
Les questions en litige
[16]
De nombreuses questions sont posées dans le mémoire de la demanderesse, mais celles-ci peuvent se résumer comme suit:
1. La SPR a-t-elle erré dans l'évaluation de la crédibilité de la demanderesse?
2. La SPR a-t-elle erré dans l'évaluation de la crainte objective de persécution?
Aux fins de cette décision, l'analyse de ces deux questions peut être regroupée sous une seule analyse soit celle de la crédibilité.
3. La SPR a-t-elle adéquatement considéré l'effet cumulatif des événements?
V.
L'analyse
A.
La norme de contrôle applicable
[17]
La norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique à l'appréciation de la crédibilité et de la crainte objectivement bien fondée de persécution (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Su
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[18]
La question à savoir si la SPR devait tenir compte de l'effet cumulatif des incidents s'évalue selon la norme de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
B.
L'analyse de la crédibilité
[19]
Le rôle de la Cour est limité quant aux conclusions relatives à la crédibilité « étant donné que le tribunal a eu l'occasion d'entendre les témoins, d'observer leur comportement et de relever toutes les nuances et conditions factuelles contenues dans la preuve » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au paragr-aphe 42 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[20]
Premièrement, la décision de la SPR de tirer une inférence négative des difficultés de la demanderesse de décrire la nature de sa relation avec M. Somji et de fournir des détails sur les enfants de celui-ci est raisonnable.
[21]
Dans son témoignage écrit justifiant sa demande d'asile, la demanderesse mentionne: « j'ai été appelé par un ami de longue date d'origine indienne du nom d'Ali Somji ». Questionnée par la SPR, la demanderesse ajoute que c'était « vraiment un ami d'affaires ». La demanderesse ne connaissait pas le nom des enfants de M. Somji et, selon la SPR, a hésité quant au nom de l'épouse de ce dernier. La SPR peut tenir compte du comportement du témoin, y compris de ses hésitations, du manque de précision de ses propos ou du fait qu'il modifie ou étoffe sa version des faits ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au paragraphe 45).
[22]
Il est vrai que l'ensemble du témoignage de la demanderesse révèle qu'elle avait connaissance des habitudes d'affaires de M. Somji, de la date de son enterrement, des coutumes qui prévalaient à son enterrement, de la fréquence à laquelle elle le rencontrait, de sa nationalité et de l'âge approximatif de ses enfants. Cependant, même si je reconnais l'existence de la relation d'affaires entre la demanderesse et Monsieur Somji, et que la crédibilité de son témoignage a été affectée par des composantes culturelles, tel que le soulève l'avocat de la demanderesse, je suis d'avis qu'il est raisonnable de croire que la nature cette relation ne permet pas de conclure qu'elle a été la confidente privilégiée de M. Somji, un homme dont la vie était en danger.
[23]
Le témoignage de la demanderesse ne permet pas de douter qu'il existât une relation durable entre elle et M. Somji, mais cela ne suffit pas à entacher la raisonnabilité générale des conclusions de la SPR. La SPR n'est pas satisfaite de la suffisance de la preuve permettant de conclure que la demanderesse et M. Somji étaient suffisamment proches pour que M. Somji communique de l'information sensible à la demanderesse. Selon moi, les conclusions de la SPR à cet égard sont raisonnables.
[24]
Deuxièmement, je suis d'avis que la SPR a raisonnablement conclu que le témoignage de la demanderesse relativement à la persécution dont elle allègue être la victime est contradictoire et incohérent.

Il est raisonnable de tirer une inférence négative du fait que la demanderesse ne peut expliquer de façon claire les motifs de la persécution dont elle est victime. Celle-ci affirme qu'elle pourrait être persécutée en raison de son passé de militante. Or, questionnée par la SPR à ce sujet, elle mentionne que depuis septembre 2010 elle n'a « plus eu de problèmes [parce qu'elle a] arrêté toute participation aux activités de AC-Génocide ». La demanderesse affirme qu'elle pourrait être persécutée parce qu'elle a été un témoin privilégié de l'incendie et une confidente directe de M. Somji. Or, la possibilité qu'une poudre chimique a contribué à la propagation de l'incendie est de notoriété publique. La demanderesse ne peut être un témoin privilégié puisque même M. Somji n'avait pas d'information privilégiée concernant le fait que la poudre qu'il a vendue aurait pu être utilisée aux fins de l'incendie du marché du Bujumbura. Qui plus est, il n'existe aucune preuve au dossier à l'effet que le SNR soupçonnait la demanderesse de posséder de l'information privilégiée.
[26]
La demanderesse affirme être persécuté et ne pouvoir trouver refuge nulle part, mais son mari est toujours là et travaille dans les lieux visités par le SNR, même après que la demanderesse eût partagé avec lui les confidences de M. Somji.
[27]
De plus, rien n'indique que la famille de M. Somji a été victime de persécution. Pourtant, il est raisonnable de supposer que la demanderesse, lorsqu'elle a vu sa vie menacée, aurait au moins cherché à savoir si la famille de son ami de longue date était également persécutée.
[28]
La jurisprudence de notre Cour établit que les incohérences entre diverses versions des faits d'un demandeur constituent un fondement solide aux décisions défavorables relatives à la crédibilité (
Su
au paragraphe 8; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au paragraphe 43). Tirer une inférence négative des contradictions factuelles mentionnées plus haut ne me semble pas déraisonnable.
[29]
Finalement, la demanderesse a mentionné qu'elle retournerait au Burundi lorsqu'elle aura les papiers du Canada, mais qu'elle n'a pas l'intention d'y retourner pour l'instant. De façon générale, il me semble raisonnable de conclure qu'un individu qui souhaite fuir une mort certaine ne suggère pas à un agent des services frontaliers qu'il considère retourner dans son pays une fois protégé par le Canada. Même en considérant qu'elle ne souhaitait qu'indiquer son désir de retourner un jour au Burundi, le fait de considérer cette option à peine un mois après avoir quitté le lieu des persécutions ne milite pas en sa faveur.
[30]
L'avocat de la demanderesse soulève que la SPR a omis de considérer le contexte politique au Burundi. D'une part, la jurisprudence établit qu'il importe peu « que les motifs de la SPR ne soient pas parfaits ou même que la Cour soit en accord avec la conclusion, ou encore avec chaque étape du processus d'analyse de la crédibilité suivi par la SPR » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au paragraphe 60). À titre d'exemple, dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au paragraphe 34, l'honorable juge Shore souligne que la décision de la SPR concernant la crédibilité du demandeur aurait dû tenir compte du contexte des éléments de preuve relatifs à la situation du pays, mais conclut néanmoins que la SPR avait raisonnablement jugé qu'il était invraisemblable que le demandeur ait embrassé un homme dans une boîte de nuit hétérosexuelle en sachant qu'il pourrait être emprisonné ou exécuté. D'autre part, l'ensemble du dossier révèle que la SPR s'est assurée de comprendre les explications de la demanderesse, la questionnant à maintes reprises sur les motifs politiques pouvant expliquer la persécution dont elle allègue être la victime, mais celle-ci n'a fourni aucune réponse satisfaisante.

L'effet cumulatif des événements
[31]
Dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 42, la Cour d'appel fédérale nous éclaire sur la prise en compte de l'effet cumulatif des événements:
Il ressort de ces précédents que la Commission a l'obligation de tenir compte de tous les faits qui peuvent avoir une incidence sur l'affirmation du demandeur d'asile suivant laquelle il craint avec raison d'être persécuté, y compris des incidents qui, pris isolément, ne constitueraient pas de la persécution, mais qui, pris globalement, pourraient justifier une allégation de crainte fondée de persécution.
[32]
Dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au paragraphe 25, le juge Teitelbaum précise l'application du standard déterminé par la Cour d'appel fédérale:
J'ai à l'esprit la norme exigeante établie par la Cour d'appel fédérale relativement à l'analyse de la Commission sur l'effet cumulatif des épreuves des demandeurs d'asile. Cette analyse doit être plus qu'une évaluation raisonnable des circonstances, elle doit être correcte. En l'espèce, je suis convaincu que la Commission avait en fait à l'esprit tous les aspects des diverses allégations des demandeurs, leurs effets sur eux, et quels effets ils pourraient avoir sur les demandeurs s'ils étaient renvoyés au Mexique. Le fait que dans son analyse, la Commission ne s'est pas exprimée en utilisant les termes d'une méthode « cumulative » n'est pas le signe d'une analyse incorrecte. Il est clair que la Commission a examiné tous les incidents décrits par les demandeurs, à la fois de façon individuelle et en tant que groupe. Par conséquent, je ne trouve aucune base pour infirmer la décision de la Commission pour ces motifs.
[33]
La demanderesse argumente que l'effet cumulatif des actes dont elle a été victime doit être pris en considération, soit: son emprisonnement durant quatre jours en 2006 en raison de son militantisme, les pneus crevés de sa voiture, la tentative alléguée du SNR de renverser ses enfants à l'aide d'une camionnette et, de façon générale, l'ensemble de ses contacts avec le SNR. Or, suite à la lecture de l'ensemble du dossier, il m'appert que la SPR a questionné la demanderesse sur l'ensemble des persécutions dont elle allègue avoir été victime et a tenté de concilier les différents éléments de son témoignage. Le passage suivant du procès-verbal illustre que la SPR a tissé des liens entre les différents éléments du témoignage:
Q: Vous avez été arrêté en 2006, d'après ce que vous ...l'information que vous fournissez dans votre FDA. Suite à cette arrestation de 2006, est-ce que vous avez eu d'autres problèmes avec les autorités avant la question de l'incendie?
R: Je n'ai plus eu de problèmes parce que, quand même, depuis septembre 2010, j'ai arrêté toute participation aux activités AC-Génocide.
Q: Est-ce que vous avez des preuves, des éléments preuve relativement à vos liens d'affaires ou à vos liens d'amitié avec monsieur Ali Somji?
R: Je n'en ai pas.
[34]
Le fait que la SPR ait tiré des conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse ne signifie pas que ses allégations n'ont pas été considérées cumulativement.
[35]
En conclusion, la demanderesse n'est pas parvenue à démontrer que la décision de la SPR était déraisonnable. Bien que la décision de la SPR soit imparfaite, il n'en demeure pas moins que ses conclusions quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse sont raisonnables. De plus, le dossier et la décision indiquent que l'ensemble des événements a été considéré.
