Introduction et Background
[1]
Boswell, J.:
This is an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board.
[2]
The Applicant is a 36-year-old citizen of Turkey who claims to fear that he will be persecuted in that country for being an Armenian Orthodox Christian. He was a seafarer who left Turkey on a job in July 2013, but he abandoned his employment once his ship arrived in the United States of America in September, 2013. After spending some time in New York City, he entered Canada illegally and made an inland claim for refugee protection in October, 2013.
[3]
On February 7, 2014, the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] determined that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The RPD found that much of the Applicant's story was not credible. It doubted that the Applicant was a practicing Christian while he lived in Turkey, as his Turkish identity card stated his religion was Islam. Although the Applicant said his parents had declared that was his religion to protect him from discrimination and he was a "hidden Armenian," the RPD found this did not make sense since the Applicant also claimed that it would be obvious from his last name that he was Armenian, and Armenians were generally presumed to be Christian. Moreover, the Applicant had submitted a letter from an evangelist at a church in Toronto who said the Applicant "expressed his desire to study about Christianity with a view to becoming a Christian," and was only baptized in Canada on November 6, 2013. Other letters submitted to support the Applicant's claims were unconvincing. The RPD therefore found that the Applicant "was not a fully practicing Christian before coming to Canada and pursued officially becoming one in Canada only as a means to bolster his refugee protection claim."
[4]
The RPD gave a number of reasons for doubting other aspects of the Applicant's claim:
• The Applicant claimed he never personally applied for a visa to the United States and was in the United States on September 6, 2013, but a biometrics report showed he applied for a United States visa from Istanbul on September 19, 2013, and his application was denied.
• The Applicant said he fled his home town in 1998 because he was threatened, yet later said he and his entire family returned to their home town for half a year, every year.
• Some of the Applicant's central allegations were that he talked to some Christian missionaries who his captain invited aboard the ship he worked on, that he was beaten up by his fellow shipmates after they found a bible in his room, and that he was mistreated by the police and charged with "talking negatively about Turkey." However, some details of these incidents were omitted from his narrative and he never pointed to any particular law that he was accused of violating. The RPD found it was implausible that the police would apprehend the Applicant for "missionary activities" when the ship's captain specifically invited missionaries on board and the maximum number of people he could influence was 24.
• The Applicant did not supply corroborating documents which the RPD expected to see, such as copies of court documents relating to his alleged arrest or any materials from the ship documenting the incident that allegedly occurred on board. Other documentary evidence that was supplied was not convincing.
• The Applicant never made any asylum claim in the United States, which undermined his claim of subjective fear.
[5]
The RPD then assessed the likelihood of future persecution, and it found the Applicant was exaggerating when he claimed that, as an Armenian Christian, he would never be able to work again. He had previously worked on his family's farm, in a mall selling t-shirts, and on a ship whose captain regularly invited Christian missionaries on board. The RPD said there was no reason he could not find similar employment, even living openly as a Christian, in Turkey. The RPD next recited some of the documentary evidence and concluded that "there is some societal discrimination against Christians but overall they are able to practice their religion freely as the claimant alleges he did before he left Turkey - he stated that he attended Church every Sunday." The RPD therefore dismissed the Applicant's claim as he had not established that "he would face harm rising to the level of persecution should he return to Turkey on account of his ethnicity and or [
sic
] religion."
[6]
The Applicant appealed the RPD's decision, but the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] of the IRB dismissed the appeal on June 10, 2014, and confirmed that the Applicant was not entitled to protection under either section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
Act
]. The Applicant now seeks judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Act
, asking the Court to set aside the RAD's decision and order a different panel of the RAD to re-determine his appeal.
II.
Issues
[7]
This application raises the following issues:
1. What standard of review should this Court apply to the RAD's decision?
2. Did the RAD apply an appropriate standard of review to the RPD's decision?
3. Did the RAD err by upholding the RPD's decision that the Applicant was not a practicing Christian in Turkey?
4. Having found that the RPD erred by expecting documentary evidence that was not reasonably available, was it an error for the RAD to still dismiss the appeal?
III.
The RAD Decision
[8]
The RAD began its reasons by rejecting the new evidence presented by the Applicant: i.e., a freedom of information request he made in the United States looking for anything relating to his alleged visa applications, and another letter from an evangelist at his church. Although the freedom of information request was made after the RPD decision, the RAD noted that subsection 110(4) was very similar to paragraph 113(a), the provision which governs the introduction of new evidence for pre-removal risk assessments. It therefore applied the factors set out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 675, and decided that the request for information was irrelevant; only the results of that request could be expected to disturb the RPD's evaluation of the evidence, and those had not been presented. As for the letter from his church, the RAD determined it was not really new evidence; it was identical to the letter which had been submitted to the RPD and only the date had been changed.
[9]
The RAD then considered how it should review decisions of the RPD, basing its analysis on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Admin LR (5th) 181 [
Newton
]. It concluded that the correctness standard should apply for questions of law, but reasonableness was the appropriate standard of review for questions of fact and mixed fact and law.
[10]
As for the substance of the appeal, the Applicant had alleged that the RPD erred in five ways: (1) by applying too high a test for the likelihood of persecution; (2) by failing to analyze the section 97 claim; (3) by failing to justify its findings about the Applicant's religious identity; (4) by expecting the Applicant to supply documents that were not reasonably available; and (5) by finding that he would not be perceived as an activist for his faith.
[11]
The first objection was based on the RPD's statement that the Applicant had not proven that "he would face harm rising to the level of persecution should he return to Turkey on account of his ethnicity and or [
sic
] religion." The RAD agreed with the Applicant that, taken alone, that statement could be an error since it did not set out a test for the likelihood of persecution. However, the RAD determined that the RPD had earlier stated the correct test by noting that the Applicant needed to show a serious possibility of persecution, and it was clear from the rest of the RPD's decision that the correct test was applied.
[12]
As for the absence of a full section 97 analysis, the RAD found there was no credible evidence to support a section 97 claim once the RPD had rejected the Applicant's story, and there was therefore no need to analyze it separately (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[13]
The RAD then endorsed the RPD's reasons for finding that the Applicant, although an Armenian Orthodox Christian, had not "vigorously practiced his faith in Turkey or ... suffered discrimination or persecution because of his religion." The RAD also determined it was reasonable for the RPD to draw a negative inference from the fact that the biometric information from the United States' authorities was inconsistent with the Applicant's story.
[14]
The RAD did find that some of the RPD's findings were unreasonable though. Specifically, the RAD said it was unreasonable to expect to see court documents since the Applicant had allegedly been subject to extra-judicial treatment, and it was also unreasonable to expect documents from his former employer since the Applicant allegedly left the ship without notice and owed the company money. However, the RAD found that these errors were not fatal because the RPD's other grounds for not believing the Applicant's story were reasonable and sufficient to justify the negative decision. The RAD thus dismissed the Applicant's appeal.
IV.
Analysis
A.
What standard of review should this Court apply to the RAD's decision?
[15]
The standard by which this Court should review the RAD's determination about the scope of its review of RPD decisions is not settled. As noted by Mr. Justice Simon Noël in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Yin
], the case law diverges on this subject. Some decisions state that the correctness standard applies, either because the issue is one of central importance to the legal system and outside of the RAD's expertise, or because it affects the jurisdictional lines between the RPD and the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Other decisions disagree and state that it is no more than a question of interpreting the RAD's home statute, which presumptively attracts the reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Questions on this issue have been certified in several of these cases, so this division in the case law will soon be considered by the Federal Court of Appeal.
[16]
In the meantime, I agree with Mr. Justice Luc Martineau's pragmatic approach to the issue in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. As he notes and as I summarize below, the case law is also divided on the scope of review that the RAD should apply. This creates a problem similar to one this Court once faced with respect to the residency test for citizenship (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). If the correctness standard is applied by every judge of this Court, the RAD could diligently follow one line of cases only to see its decisions set aside whenever they are reviewed by a judge who favours the other line of cases. The law requires more certainty than that. As the Federal Court of Appeal observed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 201 [
Wilson
], "the meaning of a law should not differ according to the identity of the decision-maker." The Federal Court cannot fix the problem at the RAD level so long as the judges of this Court disagree on the solution, and applying the correctness standard in this situation would undermine the rule of law even more than if the dispute was just at the RAD level (
Wilson
at paragraph 52). For similar reasons, Justice Martineau concluded in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that decisions of the RAD should be upheld so long as either of the two approaches currently accepted by the Court is applied by the RAD.
[17]
Adopting such an approach in this case, I find that the RAD's decision should be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness. This standard also applies to the RAD's factual findings and its assessment of the evidence before it is entitled to deference (see: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 53;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
Yin
at paragraph 34; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 27;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The RAD's decision should therefore not be disturbed so long as it is justifiable, intelligible, transparent, and defensible in respect of the facts and the law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47). Those criteria are met if "the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes" (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
B.
Did the RAD apply an appropriate standard of review to the RPD's decision?
[18]
The Applicant contends that the RAD was wrong to apply the reasonableness standard when reviewing the RPD's factual findings, and that it was at least required to independently reassess the evidence (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 43, 54-55). In his view, judicial standards of review are inappropriate because they were developed to negotiate a relationship between the judicial and executive branches of government, and no such concerns are engaged here. Rather, the Applicant says the RAD "should just do what the statute tells it to do" (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NSR (2d) 361).
[19]
The Applicant further contends that the broad remedial powers granted to the RAD by subsection 111(1) of the
Act
indicate that it should not defer to any findings of the RPD, and that interpretation is supported by the objectives of saving lives, bringing finality to the refugee determination system, and discouraging applications to this Court.
[20]
The Respondent defends the RAD's decision to adopt the reasonableness standard of review, since finding the facts is a job for which the RPD is much better suited to perform than the RAD. Unlike the RAD, the RPD must hold hearings and has a key role in questioning witnesses and building the evidentiary record (citing
Act
, ss 110(3), 110(4), 110(6), 170;
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, SOR/2012-256, s 33). The RPD's expertise in this regard cannot be doubted, since there are many claims that will never even go to the RAD (
Act
, s 110(2)). The Respondent further contends that it would be wasteful and inefficient for the RAD to completely reassess all the evidence, and its function is instead to supply a "true appeal" (citing e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[21]
As mentioned above, judges of this Court disagree about how the RAD should review the RPD's findings of fact and mixed fact and law. One line of cases concludes that the RAD should review the RPD's findings of fact for palpable and overriding errors (see e.g.:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 14-46; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Another line of cases concludes that the RAD must independently come to a decision and is not limited to intervening on the standard of palpable and overriding error, although it can "recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 55;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 39; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
In this case, the RAD applied
Newton
to determine that the reasonableness standard applied to the factual findings of the RPD, and concluded as follows:
[33] The
Newton
factors are better authority than those in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> for the purpose of determining the appropriate standard of review in this appeal, as they address a situation which is more similar to the context of the RAD and the RPD. There remains the matter of the interpretation of the legislation as a whole, and the conclusion that intended finality might lead the RAD to consider the refugee claim on its merits, showing little or no deference to the findings of the RPD. However, this is outweighed by other factors which favour a more deferential approach on questions of fact. The RAD is restricted in ways that the RPD is not, specifically in admitting evidence and holding oral hearings. Some questions here are ones of fact, and the Courts have consistently held that triers of fact are better situated to make findings of fact at first instance. The RPD has the opportunity to see and question the refugee claimant, while the RAD may not. Failure to defer to the RPD on matters of fact and credibility would be singularly inefficient, would undermine the integrity of the RPD process, and would do nothing to limit the length and cost of appeals to the RAD, as the RPD's proceedings would be reduced to little more than preliminary inquiries.
[34] For these reasons, the RAD concludes that, in considering this appeal, it must show deference to the factual and credibility findings of the RPD. The notion of deference to administrative tribunal decision-making requires a respectful attention to the reasons offered or which could be offered in support of the decision made. Even if the reasons given do not seem wholly adequate to support the decision, the RAD must first seek to supplement them before it substitutes its own decision.
[35] The appropriate standard of review for questions of fact raised in this appeal is one of reasonableness. Reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency, and intelligibility within the RPD's decision-making process, but also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law. [Footnotes omitted]
[23]
Both lines of cases noted above have condemned this approach by the RAD (see e.g. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 17-18, 39 and 46; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 45 and 54; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 12-13, 19-25 and 32-38; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 37; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 32-34;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The RAD has an appellate function, and it cannot limit its analysis merely to whether the RPD acted reasonably and reached a decision that fell within the range of acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law. Applying the reasonableness standard when reviewing RPD decisions, as the RAD did in this case, is typically an unreasonable error of law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 23).
[24]
However, that need not always end the matter (see e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Judicial review is discretionary, and relief can be withheld even in the face of such an error (see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 567). The issue thus reduces to this question: might the RAD have reached a different result had it selected an appropriate standard of review?
[25]
In this case, the Applicant mainly criticizes the RAD for deferring to the RPD's credibility findings. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , however, Mr. Justice Michael Phelan opined (at paragraph 55) that the RAD "can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion." Following that approach, this Court has sometimes declined to set aside deferential decisions of the RAD where the central issue was whether the Applicant was credible (see e.g.
Yin
at paragraph 36; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 8-9).
[26]
However, the RAD must still analyze the case independently, and the level of deference owed to the RPD by the RAD may not be as high as that which is demanded by the reasonableness standard (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 13; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Not every judge agrees entirely with that approach (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). But the point is that the RAD must assume its role as an appellate body. If the RAD instead judicially reviews the RPD's decision and, by reason of the reasonableness standard, unduly defers to the RPD's findings, it is not assuming its responsibility as an appellate body.
[27]
In this case, it was neither justifiable nor reasonable for the RAD not to make its own assessment of the case in clear terms. It articulated and adopted the reasonableness standard and focused unduly upon the RPD's reasons in its analysis at paragraphs 50-62 of its decision. As in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the RAD here did not make its own independent analysis of the Applicant's claim; it simply reviewed the RPD's determinations and judged them reasonable. Throughout its decision, the RAD used judicial review language and stated "the RPD found", "it [the RPD] gave little weight", "the panel concluded", "the RPD wrote", "the RPD reasonably noted", "the RPD concluded", "the RPD considered", "it was reasonable for the RPD to make". As noted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> "[i]n the face of the RAD's unequivocal assertions of deference it would be unsafe to assume that it fully carried out the kind of independent review of the evidence that is required."
[28]
Accordingly, the RAD's decision cannot be justified as an acceptable outcome defensible in respect of the facts and the law. The matter must be returned to the RAD for redetermination by another panel member. The Applicant is entitled to an appeal before the RAD, not just a recitation of the facts found by the RPD.
[29]
In view of this conclusion, there is no need to address the other two issues as stated above.
V.
Certified Question
[30]
The Applicant proposes that the following question should be certified in this case:
What is the scope of the review conducted by the Refugee Appeal Division when it considers an appeal of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division?
[31]
The Respondent submits that no question of general importance should be certified. The issue is already on its way to the Federal Court of Appeal, and certifying the same question over and over again does not facilitate timely interventions (citing e.g. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 57).
[32]
Pursuant to paragraph 74(d) of the
Act
, "an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal may be made only if, in rendering judgment, the judge certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question." Such a question "must (i) be dispositive of the appeal and (ii) transcend the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation, as well as contemplate issues of broad significance or general importance" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[33]
The proposed question was dispositive of this matter. The second criterion in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is also satisfied in this case, and many cases have already certified the question proposed by the Applicant or ones similar to it (see e.g. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 62; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 48; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 53; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[34]
However, the test in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> only sets out the threshold requirements for certifying a question. Nothing in the statute obligates the Court to certify a question whenever those criteria are met. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Martineau declined (at paragraphs 56-57) to certify the same question because there is already an appeal progressing and it would not facilitate timely intervention. The same reasoning was followed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (at paragraph 24).
[35]
On the other hand, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Madam Justice Jocelyne Gagné (at paragraph 51) certified a question because she did not want the applicant to lose his "right to propose a question for certification." Similarly, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 74, duplicative questions were certified on the basis that it would be unfair for an applicant to lose the benefits of appellate guidance on an issue solely because the Court failed to preserve his appeal rights.
[36]
I favour the view in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Certifying duplicative questions can be useful in some circumstances, since there is no guarantee that an appeal will proceed or that the Court of Appeal will even answer the question certified. However, the appeal in
Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Federal Court of Appeal will address the question.
[37]
In these circumstances, it is contrary to the purpose of paragraph 74(d) to certify a question. An appeal is denied to most applicants because Parliament has decided that the need for timely intervention outweighs the need to have an additional error-correction mechanism (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ); and that bar is lifted only because the "general importance of the question, that is, its applicability to numerous future cases, warrants the review by a court of justice" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Once that objective is satisfied by allowing a case which raises the issue to proceed to the Court of Appeal, I see no reason to flood the Court of Appeal with every case that raises the same issue in the interim. While it may seem unfair to deny someone the chance to have an alleged error corrected only because their case was not the first one to raise the question of general importance, it is no more unfair than denying somebody the chance to have an alleged error corrected only because the issue is not generally important. In other words, it is exactly as fair or unfair as Parliament intended paragraph 74(d) to be.
VI.
Conclusion
[38]
In view of the foregoing reasons, the Applicant's application for judicial review is granted, the RAD's decision is set aside and the matter returned to the RAD for a new determination.
[39]
No question of general importance is certified.
JUDGMENT
[40]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that:
the application for judicial review is allowed; the matter is returned to the Refugee Appeal Division for redetermination by a different panel member; and no question of general importance is certified.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Boswell
[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire d'une décision rendue par la Section d'appel des réfugiés (la SAR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la CISR).
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen de la Turquie, âgé de 36 ans, qui allègue craindre d'être persécuté dans ce pays parce qu'il est un Arménien de foi chrétienne orthodoxe. Il travaillait comme marin quand il est parti de la Turquie en juillet 2013, mais il a ensuite abandonné son emploi quand son navire est arrivé aux États-Unis d'Amérique en septembre 2013. Après avoir passé quelque temps à New York, il est entré illégalement au Canada et a présenté une demande d'asile dans un bureau intérieur en octobre 2013.
[3]
Le 7 février 2014, la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la CISR a décidé que le demandeur n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger. La SPR a conclu qu'une grande partie du récit du demandeur n'était pas crédible. Elle avait des réserves quant au fait que le demandeur était un chrétien pratiquant pendant qu'il vivait en Turquie, puisque sa carte d'identité turque indiquait que sa religion était l'islam. Bien que le demandeur ait affirmé que ses parents avaient déclaré que c'était sa religion afin de le protéger contre la discrimination, et qu'il était un [traduction] « Arménien clandestin », la SPR a conclu que cela était insensé, puisque le demandeur avait également affirmé qu'il était évident qu'il était Arménien d'après son nom de famille, et que les Arméniens étaient habituellement présumés être des chrétiens. De plus, le demandeur a présenté une lettre rédigée par un évangéliste d'une église de Toronto, qui a déclaré que le demandeur [traduction] « a[vait] exprimé le désir d'étudier le christianisme dans le but de devenir chrétien » et qu'il avait seulement été baptisé le 6 novembre 2013 au Canada. D'autres lettres présentées à l'appui des allégations du demandeur n'étaient pas convaincantes. La SPR a donc conclu que le demandeur [traduction] « ne pratiquait pas pleinement le christianisme avant de venir au Canada et [qu'] il a[vait] décidé de devenir officiellement chrétien au Canada seulement pour étayer sa demande d'asile ».
[4]
Voici les motifs de la SPR visant à expliquer ses réserves relativement à d'autres aspects de la demande d'asile du demandeur:
• Le demandeur a affirmé qu'il n'avait jamais personnellement présenté de demande de visa aux États-Unis et qu'il se trouvait aux États-Unis le 6 septembre 2013, alors qu'un rapport biométrique révèle qu'il avait présenté une demande de visa aux États-Unis depuis Istanbul le 19 septembre 2013, et que sa demande avait été rejetée.
• Le demandeur a affirmé qu'il avait fui sa ville natale en 1998 parce qu'il avait reçu des menaces, mais il a ensuite dit que lui et sa famille au grand complet retournaient séjourner dans leur ville natale pendant six mois tous les ans.
• Selon certaines des allégations principales du demandeur, il avait parlé à des missionnaires chrétiens, invités par son capitaine à bord du navire où il travaillait, qu'il avait été battu par des membres de l'équipage après que ceux-ci avaient découvert une bible dans sa cabine, et qu'il avait fait l'objet de mauvais traitements par la police et avait été accusé [traduction] « d'avoir parlé en mal de la Turquie ». Toutefois, certains détails de ces incidents ne figuraient pas dans son exposé circonstancié et il n'a jamais invoqué de loi particulière qu'il était accusé d'avoir enfreinte. La SPR a conclu qu'il était invraisemblable que la police ait arrêté le demandeur pour des [traduction] « activités missionnaires », alors que le capitaine du navire avait expressément invité à bord des missionnaires et qu'il ne pouvait influencer qu'un maximum de 24 personnes.
• Le demandeur n'a pas fourni les documents justificatifs que la SPR s'attendait à voir, tels que des copies de documents judiciaires concernant son arrestation alléguée, ou des documents provenant du navire décrivant l'incident qui se serait produit à bord. D'autres éléments de preuve documentaire présentés n'étaient pas convaincants.
• Le demandeur n'a jamais présenté de demande d'asile aux États-Unis, ce qui a miné son allégation de crainte subjective.
[5]
La SPR a ensuite évalué le risque de persécution future, et elle a conclu que le demandeur exagérait quand il prétendait que, à titre de chrétien arménien, il ne pourrait plus jamais travailler. Il avait déjà travaillé sur la ferme familiale, dans un centre commercial à vendre des t-shirts, et sur un navire dont le capitaine invitait régulièrement à bord des missionnaires chrétiens. La SPR a affirmé qu'il n'y avait aucune raison pour laquelle il ne pourrait pas trouver un emploi similaire, même s'il vivait ouvertement en tant que chrétien, en Turquie. La SPR a ensuite fait référence à une partie de la preuve documentaire pour conclure que [traduction] « il existe une certaine discrimination sociétale envers les chrétiens, mais ils sont généralement capables de pratiquer librement leur religion comme le demandeur d'asile allègue l'avoir fait avant de quitter la Turquie - il a affirmé qu'il allait à l'église tous les dimanches ». La SPR a donc rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur puisqu'il n'avait pas démontré que [traduction] « il serait exposé à un préjudice équivalant à de la persécution, s'il devait retourner en Turquie, du fait de son origine ethnique ou de sa religion ».
[6]
Le demandeur a interjeté appel de la décision de la SPR, mais la SAR de la CISR a rejeté l'appel le 10 juin 2014, et a confirmé que le demandeur n'avait pas droit à la protection au titre de l'article 96 ou du paragraphe 97(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi). Le demandeur sollicite maintenant le contrôle judiciaire en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la Loi; il demande à la Cour d'annuler la décision de la SAR et d'ordonner à un tribunal différemment constitué de la SAR de statuer à nouveau sur son appel.
II.
Les questions en litige
[7]
La présente demande soulève les questions suivantes:
1. Quelle norme de contrôle la Cour doit-elle appliquer à la décision de la SAR?
2. La SAR a-t-elle appliqué une norme de contrôle appropriée à la décision de la SPR?
3. La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur en confirmant la décision de la SPR selon laquelle le demandeur n'était pas un chrétien pratiquant en Turquie?
4. Ayant conclu que la SPR avait commis une erreur en s'attendant à recevoir des éléments de preuve documentaire qui n'étaient pas raisonnablement accessibles, la SAR a-t-elle fait erreur en rejetant l'appel malgré tout?
III.
La décision de la SAR
[8]
Dans ses motifs, la SAR a d'abord rejeté la nouvelle preuve présentée par le demandeur, à savoir une demande d'accès à l'information qu'il avait présentée aux États-Unis, à la recherche de renseignements concernant ses demandes de visa alléguées, ainsi qu'une autre lettre rédigée par un évangéliste membre de son église. Bien que la demande d'accès à l'information ait été faite après que la SPR a rendu sa décision, la SAR a souligné que le paragraphe 110(4) était très similaire à l'alinéa 113
a
), la disposition qui régit la présentation de nouveaux éléments de preuve aux fins des examens des risques avant renvoi. Elle a donc appliqué les facteurs énoncés au paragraphe 13 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 675, et elle a conclu que la demande d'accès à l'information n'était pas pertinente; seuls les résultats de cette demande pouvaient être susceptibles de modifier l'appréciation de la preuve par la SPR, et ces résultats n'avaient pas été présentés. Quant à la lettre de son église, la SAR a conclu qu'il ne s'agissait pas réellement d'un nouvel élément de preuve; elle était identique à celle qui avait été présentée à la SPR et seule la date avait été changée.
[9]
La SAR a ensuite examiné l'approche qu'elle devrait utiliser lors de l'examen de décisions rendues par la SPR, en fondant son analyse sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Admin LR (5th) 181 (
Newton
). Elle a conclu que la norme de la décision correcte devait s'appliquer aux questions de droit, mais que la norme de la décision raisonnable était la norme de contrôle appropriée applicable aux questions de fait et aux questions mixtes de fait et de droit.
[10]
En ce qui concerne le fond de l'appel, le demandeur a allégué que la SPR avait commis des erreurs relativement à cinq aspects: (1) en appliquant un critère trop exigeant relativement au risque de persécution; (2) en omettant d'analyser l'allégation fondée sur l'article 97; (3) en ne justifiant pas ses conclusions au sujet de l'identité religieuse du demandeur; (4) en s'attendant à ce que le demandeur fournisse des documents qui n'étaient pas raisonnablement accessibles; (5) en concluant qu'il ne serait pas perçu comme un activiste en raison de sa religion.
[11]
La première objection était fondée sur la déclaration de la SPR selon laquelle le demandeur n'avait pas prouvé que [traduction] « il serait exposé à un préjudice équivalant à de la persécution, s'il devait retourner en Turquie, du fait de son origine ethnique ou de sa religion ». La SAR a souscrit à l'avis du demandeur selon lequel cet énoncé, pris isolément, pouvait constituer une erreur, puisqu'il n'énonçait pas de critère relatif au risque de persécution. Cependant, la SAR a décidé que la SPR avait énoncé plus tôt le bon critère en soulignant que le demandeur devait démontrer une possibilité sérieuse de persécution, et il ressortait clairement du reste de la décision de la SPR que le bon critère avait été appliqué.
[12]
Pour ce qui est de l'absence d'une analyse intégrale relativement à l'article 97, la SAR a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucun élément de preuve crédible pour étayer une allégation fondée sur l'article 97 une fois le récit du demandeur rejeté par la SPR, et que, par conséquent, une analyse distincte n'était pas nécessaire (citant la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 13).
[13]
La SAR a ensuite approuvé les motifs de la SPR pour ce qui est d'avoir conclu que le demandeur, bien que chrétien orthodoxe arménien, n'avait pas [traduction] « pratiqu[é] activement sa foi en Turquie ou [...] souffert de discrimination ou de persécution en raison de sa religion ». La SAR a décidé, en outre, qu'il était raisonnable que la SPR tire une incidence défavorable du fait que les renseignements biométriques provenant des autorités aux États-Unis ne cadraient pas avec le récit du demandeur.
[14]
La SAR a cependant bel et bien jugé que certaines conclusions de la SPR étaient déraisonnables. En particulier, elle a déclaré qu'il était déraisonnable de s'attendre à voir des documents judiciaires, puisque le demandeur aurait fait l'objet d'un traitement extrajudiciaire, et qu'il était également déraisonnable de s'attendre à des documents de son ancien employeur, puisque le demandeur aurait quitté le navire sans préavis, alors qu'il devait de l'argent à la société. La SAR a toutefois conclu que ces erreurs n'étaient pas fatales, parce que les autres motifs donnés par la SPR pour ne pas croire le récit du demandeur étaient raisonnables et suffisants pour justifier la décision défavorable. La SAR a donc rejeté l'appel interjeté par le demandeur.
IV.
Analyse
A.
Quelle norme de contrôle la Cour doit-elle appliquer à la décision de la SAR?
[15]
La norme de contrôle que la Cour doit appliquer à la question de la portée de l'examen fait par la SAR des décisions de la SPR n'est pas établie. Comme l'a souligné M. le juge Simon Noël dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Yin
), au paragraphe 32, la jurisprudence est partagée sur cette question. Certains précédents énoncent que la norme de la décision correcte s'applique, soit parce qu'il s'agit d'une question d'une importance capitale pour le système juridique et étrangère au domaine d'expertise de la SAR, ou parce qu'elle touche les compétences respectives de la SPR et de la SAR (p. ex.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 25 à 34;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 60 et 61). D'autres précédents soutiennent le contraire et énoncent qu'il s'agit simplement d'une question d'interprétation de la loi constitutive de la SAR, qui est présumée appeler l'application de la norme de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 16 à 26;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 26 à 33). Des questions sur cet aspect ont été certifiées dans plusieurs de ces précédents. Cette division présente dans la jurisprudence sera donc bientôt examinée par la Cour d'appel fédérale.
[16]
Entre-temps, je souscris à l'approche pragmatique adoptée par M. le juge Luc Martineau à l'égard de la question dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 46 à 52. Comme il le fait remarquer et comme je le résume ci-dessous, la jurisprudence est également divisée en ce qui a trait à ce que devrait être la portée de l'examen fait par la SAR. Cela engendre un problème similaire à celui auquel la Cour s'est retrouvée confrontée en ce qui concerne le critère de résidence appliqué en matière d'attribution de la citoyenneté (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 1, 24 et 25). Si tous les juges de la Cour appliquaient la norme de la décision correcte, la SAR pourrait suivre avec diligence un courant jurisprudentiel et voir ses décisions annulées uniquement lorsqu'elles font l'objet d'un examen par un juge qui privilégie le courant jurisprudentiel contraire. Le droit requiert un plus haut degré de certitude. Comme la Cour d'appel fédérale l'a fait observer au paragraphe 52 de l'arrêt
Wilson c Énergie atomique du Canada limitée
, 2015 CAF 17, 467 NR 201 (
Wilson
), « le sens d'une loi ne devrait pas varier selon l'identité du décideur ». La Cour fédérale ne peut résoudre le problème au niveau de la SAR tant que les juges de la Cour demeurent en désaccord au sujet de la solution, et le fait d'appliquer la norme de la décision correcte dans la présente situation porterait encore plus atteinte au principe de la primauté du droit que si le différend existait uniquement au niveau de la SAR (
Wilson
, au paragraphe 52). Pour des motifs similaires, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Martineau a conclu qu'il y avait lieu de confirmer les décisions de la SAR tant que cette dernière appliquait l'une des deux approches actuellement acceptées par la Cour.
[17]
Adoptant une telle approche en l'espèce, je conclus que la décision de la SAR devrait être examinée selon la norme de la décision raisonnable. Cette norme s'applique en outre aux conclusions de fait de la SAR, et il faut faire preuve de retenue à l'égard de son appréciation de la preuve (voir: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 20;
Yin
, au paragraphe 34; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 27;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 14). La décision de la SAR ne devrait donc pas être modifiée dans la mesure où elle respecte les principes de justification, d'intelligibilité, de transparence et qu'elle peut se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47). Ces critères sont respectés si « les motifs [...] permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables » (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 16).
B.
La SAR a-t-elle appliqué une norme de contrôle appropriée à la décision de la SPR?
[18]
Le demandeur prétend que la SAR a erronément appliqué la norme de la décision raisonnable au moment d'examiner les conclusions de fait de la SPR et que la SAR était tenue, à tout le moins, d'effectuer une nouvelle appréciation indépendante de la preuve (citant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 43, 54 et 55). À son avis, les normes de contrôle judiciaire sont inadéquates parce qu'elles ont été élaborées en vue de convenir d'une relation entre les tribunaux et le pouvoir exécutif et qu'aucune considération de ce genre n'est en cause en l'espèce. Le demandeur affirme plutôt que la SAR [traduction] « devrait seulement faire ce que la loi lui dicte » (citant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NSR (2d) 361, au paragraphe 23).
[19]
Le demandeur prétend en outre que, selon le vaste pouvoir de redressement conféré à la SAR par le paragraphe 111(1) de la Loi, elle ne doit pas s'en remettre aux conclusion de la SPR et que cette interprétation est soutenue par les objectifs visant à sauver des vies, à assurer un caractère définitif au système d'octroi de l'asile et à décourager la présentation de demandes à la Cour.
[20]
Le défendeur défend la décision de la SAR d'avoir adopté la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable, puisque la tâche consistant à tirer des conclusions de fait en est une dont la SPR peut bien mieux s'acquitter que la SAR. Contrairement à la SAR, la SPR doit tenir des audiences et elle joue un rôle clé dans l'interrogatoire des témoins et la constitution du dossier de preuve (citant les paragraphes 110(3), 110(4) et 110(6), ainsi que l'article 170 de la Loi; l'article 33 des
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2012-256). L'expertise de la SPR à cet égard ne fait nul doute, puisque bon nombre des demandes ne se rendront même pas en appel à la SAR (paragraphe 110(2) de la Loi). Le défendeur soutient par ailleurs que le fait pour la SAR d'apprécier à nouveau l'ensemble de la preuve constituerait du gaspillage et serait inefficace, et que son rôle consiste plutôt à assurer un [traduction] « appel véritable » (citant, p. ex.,
Canada (Procureur général) c Bedford
, 2013 CSC 72, [2013] 3 RCS 1101, aux paragraphes 49, 51, 55 et 56;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47).
[21]
Comme il a déjà été mentionné, les juges de la Cour ne s'entendent pas au sujet de la façon dont la SAR devrait examiner les conclusions de fait et les conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit de la SPR. D'un côté, nous avons un courant jurisprudentiel voulant que la SAR examine les conclusions de fait de la SPR seulement en cas d'erreur manifeste et dominante (voir, p. ex.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 34; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 14 à 46;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 27 et 28). De l'autre côté, nous avons un courant jurisprudentiel voulant que la SAR soit tenue de rendre une décision indépendante et qu'elle ne soit pas obligée d'intervenir selon la norme de l'erreur manifeste et dominante, bien qu'elle puisse « reconnaître et respecter la conclusion de la SPR sur des questions comme la crédibilité et/ou lorsque la SPR jouit d'un avantage particulier pour tirer une conclusion » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 55;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 16 à 20; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 39;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
En l'espèce, la SAR a appliqué l'arrêt
Newton
pour établir que la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable s'appliquait aux conclusions de fait de la SPR, et elle a ainsi conclu:
[33] Pour déterminer la norme de contrôle qui s'applique au présent appel, les facteurs établis dans
Newton
font davantage autorité que les facteurs énoncés dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , parce que la situation à laquelle ils se rapportent ressemble davantage au contexte de la SAR et de la SPR. Il subsiste la question de l'interprétation de la loi dans son ensemble, et la conclusion selon laquelle le caractère définitif visé pourrait amener la SAR à examiner la demande d'asile selon son bien-fondé, en faisant preuve de peu de déférence, voire aucune, à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR. Cependant, d'autres facteurs qui exigent une approche davantage empreinte de déférence en ce qui concerne les questions de fait l'emportent sur ces considérations. La SAR est assujettie à des restrictions auxquelles la SPR n'est pas soumise, particulièrement en ce qui concerne l'admission d'éléments de preuve et la tenue d'audiences. Certaines questions à trancher en l'espèce sont des questions de fait, et les tribunaux ont toujours soutenu que les juges des faits sont mieux placés pour tirer des conclusions de fait en première instance. La SPR a la possibilité de voir et de questionner le demandeur d'asile, ce qui n'est pas toujours le cas de la SAR. Le défaut de s'en remettre à la SPR pour les questions de fait et de crédibilité serait particulièrement inefficace, minerait l'intégrité du processus de la SPR et ne limiterait en rien la durée et le coût des appels interjetés à la SAR, car les audiences à la SPR ne seraient guère plus que des enquêtes préliminaires.
[34] Pour ces motifs, la SAR conclut que, pour statuer sur le présent appel, elle doit faire preuve de déférence à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR relatives aux faits et à la crédibilité. La notion de déférence à l'égard du processus décisionnel d'un tribunal administratif exige que soit portée une attention respectueuse aux motifs donnés ou qui pourraient être donnés à l'appui de la décision rendue. Même si les motifs qui ont été donnés ne semblent pas tout à fait convenables pour étayer la décision, la SAR doit d'abord chercher à les compléter avant de substituer sa propre décision à celle qui a été rendue.
[35] La norme de contrôle applicable pour les questions de fait soulevées en l'espèce est celle de la décision raisonnable. Le caractère raisonnable d'une décision tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel de la SPR, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. [Notes de bas de page omises.]
[23]
Les deux courants jurisprudentiels susmentionnés ont condamné cette approche adoptée par la SAR (voir, p. ex., <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 17, 18, 39 et 46; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 45 et 54; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 12, 13, 19 à 25 ainsi que 32 à 38;
Djossou,
au paragraphe 37; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 32 à 34;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 50;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 16). La SAR exerce une fonction d'appel et elle ne peut pas limiter son analyse à la question de savoir si la SPR a agi de façon raisonnable et est parvenue à une décision appartenant aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Appliquer la norme de la décision raisonnable aux décisions de la SPR, comme la SAR l'a fait en l'espèce, constitue habituellement une erreur de droit déraisonnable (
Siliya,
au paragraphe 23).
[24]
Toutefois, cela ne signifie pas toujours que l'affaire s'arrête là (voir, p. ex.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 13 et 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 8 et 9). Un contrôle judiciaire est discrétionnaire, et une mesure de réparation peut être refusée même en présence d'une erreur de ce genre (voir:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 567, au paragraphe 38). La question se résume donc à ceci: la SAR serait-elle parvenue à un autre résultat si elle avait choisi la norme de contrôle appropriée?
[25]
En l'espèce, le demandeur reproche surtout à la SAR de s'en être remise aux conclusions de la SPR quant à la crédibilité. Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , M. le juge Michael Phelan était toutefois d'avis (au paragraphe 55) que la SAR « [pouvait] reconnaître et respecter la conclusion de la SPR sur des questions comme la crédibilité et/ou lorsque la SPR joui[ssait] d'un avantage particulier pour tirer une conclusion ». Conformément à cette approche, la Cour s'est parfois abstenue d'annuler des décisions de la SAR qui commandent la retenue quand la question centrale était celle de la crédibilité du demandeur (voir, p. ex.,
Yin
, au paragraphe 36;
Ali,
aux paragraphes 8 et 9).
[26]
Toutefois, la SAR est toujours tenue d'effectuer sa propre analyse du dossier, et le degré de déférence dont elle doit faire preuve à l'égard de la SPR peut ne pas être aussi élevé que celui exigé par la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir
Pataraia,
au paragraphe 13;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 31 à 33). Les juges ne sont pas tous entièrement d'accord avec cette approche (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 38). Mais il reste que la SAR est tenue d'assumer son rôle en qualité d'organisme d'appel. Si la SAR effectue plutôt le contrôle judiciaire de la décision de la SPR et, qu'elle s'en remet indûment aux conclusions de la SPR, en raison de la norme de la décision raisonnable, elle n'assume pas sa responsabilité à titre d'organisme d'appel.
[27]
En l'espèce, il n'était ni justifiable ni raisonnable pour la SAR de ne pas effectuer sa propre analyse du dossier en termes clairs. Elle a énoncé et adopté la norme de la décision raisonnable et s'est indûment concentrée sur les motifs de la SPR dans le cadre de son analyse présentée aux paragraphes 50 à 62 de sa décision. Tout comme dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la SAR n'a pas effectué en l'espèce sa propre analyse de la demande d'asile du demandeur; elle s'est limitée à examiner les conclusions tirées par la SPR et les a jugées raisonnables. Partout dans sa décision, la SAR a employé des termes classiques utilisés lors d'un contrôle judiciaire et a déclaré: « la SPR a conclu »; « elle [la SPR] a accordé peu de poids »; « le tribunal a conclu »; « la SPR a écrit »; « la SPR a raisonnablement souligné »; « la SPR a conclu »; « la SPR a examiné »; « il était raisonnable de la part de la SPR de tirer ». Comme il est souligné au paragraphe 8 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  « [c]ompte tenu des affirmations sans équivoque de déférence de la SAR, il serait imprudent de présumer qu'elle a procédé, dans son intégralité, au type d'examen indépendant nécessaire des éléments de preuve ».
[28]
Par conséquent, la décision de la SAR ne saurait se justifier en tant qu'issue possible acceptable au regard des faits et du droit. L'affaire doit être renvoyée à un autre commissaire de la SAR pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision. Le demandeur a droit à un appel devant la SAR, et non seulement à un exposé des faits constatés par la SPR.
[29]
À la lumière de cette conclusion, il n'est pas nécessaire d'aborder les deux autres questions susmentionnées.
V.
La question en vue de la certification
[30]
Le demandeur propose que la question suivante soit certifiée en l'espèce:
[traduction]
Quelle est la portée de l'examen effectué par la Section d'appel de l'immigration lorsqu'elle se penche sur un appel d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés?
[31]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il n'y a aucune question de portée générale à certifier. La question est déjà en voie d'être examinée à la Cour d'appel fédérale, et le fait de certifier sans cesse la même question ne permet pas des interventions en temps opportun (citant p. ex. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 57).
[32]
Conformément à l'alinéa 74
d
) de la Loi, « le jugement consécutif au contrôle judiciaire n'est susceptible d'appel en Cour d'appel fédérale que si le juge certifie que l'affaire soulève une question grave de portée générale et énonce celle-ci ». La question « doit i) être déterminante quant à l'issue de l'appel, ii) transcender les intérêts des parties au litige et porter sur des questions ayant des conséquences importantes ou qui sont de portée générale » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 9).
[33]
La question proposée était déterminante quant à l'issue de l'affaire. Le second critère énoncé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> est également satisfait en l'espèce, et la question proposée par le demandeur ou des questions similaires ont déjà été certifiées dans bon nombre de décisions (voir, p. ex.,
Huruglica,
au paragraphe 62;
Spasoja,
au paragraphe 48; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 13).
[34]
Toutefois, les critères dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne font qu'énoncer le seuil exigé aux fins de la certification d'une question. Rien dans la loi n'oblige la Cour à certifier une question quand les critères sont respectés. Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Martineau a décidé de ne pas certifier (aux paragraphes 56 et 57) la même question parce qu'il y avait déjà un appel en cours et que cela ne permettrait pas des interventions en temps opportun. Le même raisonnement a été suivi dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (au paragraphe 24).
[35]
Par contre, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , madame la juge Jocelyne Gagné (au paragraphe 51) a certifié une question parce qu'elle ne voulait pas que le demandeur perde son « droit de proposer une question aux fins de certification ». Dans un même ordre d'idées, au paragraphe 27 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 74, des questions répétitives ont été certifiées au motif qu'il serait injuste que le demandeur perde les avantages pouvant résulter de l'arrêt que la Cour d'appel fédérale prononcerait à cet égard, simplement parce que la Cour n'aurait pas préservé les droits d'appel du demandeur.
[36]
Je préfère le point de vue énoncé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Il peut être utile dans certaines circonstances de certifier des questions répétitives, puisqu'il n'existe nulle garantie qu'il y aura poursuite de l'instance en appel ou que la Cour d'appel répondra à la question certifiée. Cependant, l'appel interjeté dans l'affaire
Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  année, et la Cour d'appel fédérale se penchera sur la question.
[37]
En ces circonstances, le fait de certifier une question va à l'encontre de l'objet de l'alinéa 74
d
). La plupart des demandeurs se voient refuser un appel parce que le législateur a décidé que le besoin d'une intervention en temps opportun surpassait le besoin de disposer d'un autre mécanisme pour corriger les erreurs (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 27); et la barre est relevée uniquement en raison du fait que la « portée générale de la question, c'est-à-dire son applicabilité à un grand nombre de cas dans le futur, justifie son examen par une cour de justice » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 43). Une fois que cet objectif est satisfait, en accueillant une demande dans laquelle est soulevée la question d'un examen ultérieur à la Cour d'appel fédérale, je ne vois aucune raison dans l'intervalle de submerger la Cour d'appel avec chaque cas où la même question est soulevée. Bien qu'il puisse sembler injuste de refuser à une personne la possibilité de corriger une erreur alléguée, uniquement parce que son cas n'est pas le premier à soulever une question de portée générale, cela n'est pas plus injuste que de refuser à une personne la possibilité de corriger une erreur alléguée, uniquement en raison du fait qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une question de portée générale. Autrement dit, c'est aussi juste ou injuste que ce que le législateur avait envisagé à l'alinéa 74
d
).
VI.

[38]
Compte tenu des motifs exposés ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur sera accueillie, la décision de la SAR sera annulée et l'affaire sera renvoyée à la SAR pour qu'elle rende une nouvelle décision.
[39]
Aucune question de portée générale n'est certifiée.
