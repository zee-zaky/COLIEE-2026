Jerome, A.C.J.
: This matter came on for hearing on July 15, 1993, in Calgary, Alberta. The defendants seek an order pursuant to s. 27(2)(a) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, extending the time within which to file an appeal from the interlocutory injunction granted by my brother MacKay, J. on June 25, 1993. The plaintiff also makes application for an order, pursuant to rule 355(4) of the
Federal Court Rules
, that the defendants be required to show cause why they should not be adjudged guilty of contempt of this court. At the hearing of this matter, I granted the plaintiff's application for the following reasons.
[2]
The law is clear that even where an appeal has been launched in a timely manner, in the absence of a stay, the appellant must obey the Order.
[3]
The affidavit evidence submitted by the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of wilful and contumacious conduct on the part of the defendants. A party in contempt of court is not entitled to the benefit of the court's discretion.
[4]
Furthermore, the additional question raised by the defendants with respect to the court's jurisdiction in this matter may be advanced at the hearing initiated by the show cause order.
[5]
Therefore, as a matter of priority, the contempt proceeding takes precedence over the defendant's application for an extension of time within which to appeal.
[6]
For these reasons, the plaintiff's application for an order requiring the defendant to show cause why they should not be adjudged guilty of contempt of this court, is granted.
Order accordingly.
