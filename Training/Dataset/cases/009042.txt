Noël, J.
: This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] finding that Dondre Calbert Henry is neither a "refugee" within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA nor a "person in need of protection" under section 97 of the IRPA.
I.
Facts
[2]
Dondre Calbert Henry [the Applicant] is a citizen of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines [Saint Vincent], where he was born on October 23, 2000.
[3]
The Applicant's mother, Michelle Hooper, was appointed designated representative of her minor son.
[4]
The Applicant's mother left Saint Vincent in December 2007 to flee her abusive father. She was unable to bring the Applicant with her for financial reasons. While his mother was in Canada, the Applicant remained with his mother's friend, where he was mistreated to the extent that a hospital wanted to put him under the care of Child Welfare Services. At the request of his mother, the Applicant later moved in with his mother's parents, where he was also abused. He was put under the care of his mother's sister, who took care of him for several months until his arrival in Canada.
[5]
In May 2009, two years after arriving in Canada, the Applicant's mother sought asylum claiming that she was abused by her father, who did not want to support her financially. Her claim was denied in February 2011 for lack of fear of persecution. She filed an application for the judicial review of this decision, but the application was rejected.
[6]
The Applicant's mother claims that she cannot seek permanent residency on the basis of humanitarian and compassionate grounds [H&C application] as the costs involved in such an application exceed her financial capabilities. However, during the judicial review hearing, counsel for the Applicant informed that the mother and her son had filed an H&C Application.
[7]
The Applicant visited his mother in Canada for two months in July 2010 but returned to his grand-parents' house. The Applicant returned to Canada in July 2011 and claimed asylum.
[8]
The Applicant's mother was advised that her removal from Canada would take place no later than on July 12, 2012. However, she requested the deferral of her removal, which was granted after arguing that her son, the Applicant, was suffering from severe separation anxiety, that he should not be separated from his mother and that, as a result, her removal should be postponed pending the outcome of the Applicant's claim for refugee protection.
II.
Decision under review
[9]
The RPD was satisfied with the evidence submitted as to the Applicant's identity.
[10]
It ultimately found that the Applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution should he return to Saint Vincent accompanied by his mother, nor would he be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.
[11]
After laying out the facts on which it relied its decision, the RPD explained that it was considering the Applicant's claim in the context of the fact that his mother's claim for refugee protection had been rejected, that she had decided not to file an H&C application and that her deportation was imminent.
[12]
The RPD explained that it would first examine the veracity of the allegations made with regard to the Applicant and, if these were found to be truthful, it would examine the consequences of his return to his home country.
[13]
On one hand, the RPD was satisfied, based on the evidence submitted, that the Applicant was indeed a victim of abuse and mistreatment tantamount to persecution in Saint Vincent, but on the other hand it concluded that there was not a serious possibility that he would be persecuted or that he would be subjected, in all probability, to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to his home country.
[14]
The RPD based this finding on a doctor's report according to which the Applicant greatly fears being separated from his mother again and has some friends in Saint Vincent whom he misses. The RPD insisted on the importance for the Applicant not to be separated from his mother and determined that, from a prospective point of view, the Applicant's mother will have to leave Canada. It therefore concluded to a significant change in circumstances with respect to what will happen to the Applicant should he return to Saint Vincent. He would no longer be placed in the care of his grandparents, but he would be with his mother. In consequence, the RPD found the Applicant did not have a fear of persecution.
[15]
The RPD then discussed the decision previously rendered with respect to the Applicant's mother's refugee protection claim and more specifically to the difficulties she experienced with her father. According to this decision, while the Applicant's grandfather is an abusive man and made the Applicant's mother's life unbearable, the threats were made by the man because he did not want to assume economic responsibility for his grown daughter. It seemed that he had not harmed any of his other children in recent years. Ultimately this decision found that there is not a serious possibility that the Applicant's mother would be harmed if she returned to Saint Vincent and does not return to the family home.
[16]
The RPD also considered the Applicant's mother's testimony, which states that while her son was living with her sister, several villages away from her parents' house, he still had to walk by his grandparents' house and was yelled at by his grandfather. The RPD found this part of the testimony to be not credible, as its previous decision concerning the Applicant's mother was to the effect that the Applicant's grandfather was not looking for revenge but simply did not want to support his daughter economically.
[17]
The RPD concluded that, should the Applicant return to Saint Vincent with his mother, they would not have to live close to her parents. The most important element was for the Applicant not to be separated from his mother.
[18]
The RPD then turned to the issue of the availability of psychiatric care in Saint Vincent, which falls under section 97 of the Act. It found that while the Applicant is receiving excellent treatment in Canada, the absence of the same quality of psychiatric care in Saint Vincent does not constitute persecutorial motives, given that this risk flows from legitimate financial priority reasons on the part of the country for denying the care and not from an illegitimate reason.
[19]
The RPD also considered several pieces of evidence put forward by counsel for the Applicant (e.g. a country report on corporal punishment, a study on child vulnerability, and a document addressing the treatment and support for victims with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and mental health issues) and concluded that these were not relevant to the case at bar or that they do not give rise to persecutorial reasons for denying care.
[20]
Lastly, the RPD concludes that neither the issue of state protection nor the question of internal flight alternatives is relevant in the present matter.
III.
Applicant's submission
[21]
The Applicant brings forward the following four issues which, in his opinion, render the RPD's decision unreasonable: (1) the RPD improperly applied the test for "change of circumstances" pursuant to paragraph 108(1)(
e
) of the IRPA or, alternatively, (2) it erred in determining that there was no compelling reasons to accept the Applicant's refugee claim pursuant to subsection 108(4) of the IRPA, (3) the RPD erred in finding that the Applicant would not have a fear of persecution should he return to Saint Vincent with his mother, and (4) the RPD failed to consider the Applicant's claim on its own merit.
[22]
The Applicant first submits that the RPD did not properly apply the test for "change of circumstances" pursuant to paragraph 108(1)(
e
) of the IRPA. The RPD was satisfied that the Applicant had been the victim of abuse tantamount to persecution, and despite this finding concluded that he did not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, on a balance of probabilities, should he return to Saint Vincent because of a change of circumstances - he would be with his mother. The RPD found that the Applicant's mother was going back to Saint Vincent because her removal had only been deferred and she had not filed an H&C application. While it wanted to refrain from speculating as to what could happen in the future, the RPD did just that. The fact of the matter is, at the time the decision was rendered by the RPD, the Applicant's mother was still in Canada and there were no change of circumstances to speak of.
[23]
The Applicant further argues that the test for the determination of whether there was a "change of circumstances" is set out in section 108(1)(
e
) of the IRPA. Pursuant to the wording of this provision, change needs to have already occurred.
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27
Rejection
108. (1)
A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:
[...]
(e) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
LC 2001, ch 27
Rejet
108. (1)
Est rejetée la demande d'asile et le demandeur n'a pas qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger dans tel des cas suivants:
[...]
e) les raisons qui lui ont fait demander l'asile n'existent plus.
[24]
Furthermore, the case law has established that the rejection of a claim on the basis of "change of circumstances" requires a significant change in the political or social situation in the country, which is not the case in the present matter. The Plaintiff is therefore of the opinion that the RPD improperly applied the test for "change of circumstances" and that there were no such changes in the case at bar.
[25]
Second, the Applicant submits that notwithstanding the improper application of this test, the RPD also erred in determining that there were no compelling reasons to accept the Applicant's refugee claim pursuant to subsection 108(4) of the IRPA, which the RPD was obligated to consider, as it had been found that the Applicant has been a victim of abuse tantamount to persecution. The provision reads as follows:
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27
Exception
108. (4)
Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
LC 2001, ch 27
Exception
108. (4)
L'alinéa (1)e) ne s'applique pas si le demandeur prouve qu'il y a des raisons impérieuses, tenant à des persécutions, à la torture ou à des traitements ou peines antérieurs, de refuser de se réclamer de la protection du pays qu'il a quitté ou hors duquel il est demeuré.
[26]
The Applicant submits that he still suffers from the abuse despite now living with his mother and that returning to his country of origin would be detrimental to his psychological health given his age, the trauma suffered, his continued mental and emotional anguish, etc. In concluding otherwise, the RPD either ignored the documentary evidence submitted or disingenuously dismissed the suffering endured by the Applicant. This error renders the RPD's decision unreasonable.
[27]
As a third argument, the Applicant submits that it was unreasonable for the RPD to find that the Applicant will not have a subjective fear of persecution, should he return to Saint Vincent with his mother, while having found that he was the victim of abuse tantamount to persecution. The RPD insisted on the importance for the Applicant to remain with his mother. The Applicant argues that the abuse suffered by the Applicant is being minimized by the fact that he misses his friends and does not want to be separated from his mother, both of which are reasonable expressions coming from a child in these circumstances. The Applicant adds that the decision fails to consider the special vulnerabilities of children and the
Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants
[
Guideline 3
] for the determination of the subjective fear of a child.
[28]
Lastly, the Applicant submits that the RPD failed to consider the application on its own merit and undertake an analysis of state protection. He submits that the RPD engaged in an analysis of the risks associated with the return of the mother to Saint Vincent and not of the Applicant himself, and that it concluded that mother and son will be unharmed in the future because they will be reunited in Saint Vincent. The Applicant has trouble understanding why the RPD could, on one hand, state that the Applicant suffered abuse tantamount to persecution and, on the other hand, that state protection is not relevant in the present matter. Documentation submitted clearly shows that child abuse remains a prevalent problem in Saint Vincent because of "woefully outdated" legislation and a lack of shelter for such children. The RPD focused on the Applicant's mother's claim and did not consider the application on its own merits. Given the fact that the RPD accepted the Applicant's allegation, a proper analysis of his claim was warranted.
IV. Respondent's submission
[29]
The Respondent argues that it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the Applicant would not be persecuted or abused should he return to Saint Vincent with his mother because he would be with his mother and no longer with his grandfather, i.e. a lack of prospective fear. The Respondent also adds that the RPD did not err by concluding that the Applicant had not established the existence of compelling reasons under subsection 108(4) of the IRPA.
[30]
With regard to the lack of prospective fear, the Respondent claims that the Applicant was only abused because he temporarily had to live with his grandparents. He and his mother were in the same situation - the abuse would stop if they left the grandfather's house. Also, all the evidence submitted was to the effect that the Applicant's mother's removal was only delayed pending the outcome of the Applicant's refugee protection claim. Her removal was imminent, and considering how vital this fact is to the Applicant's claim, the RPD had no other choice but to acknowledge the fact that the mother was leaving the country, as this meant that mother and child would be reunited.
[31]
The Applicant failed to establish the existence of an actual and prospective risk of return. What is more, if he is able to make a reasonable choice in order to avoid being persecuted in his country, the Applicant must pursue this option. This is the case in the present matter because the Applicant and his mother could simply decide to reside anywhere but with their abusers.
[32]
With respect to the absence of compelling reasons under section 108(4) of the IRPA, the Respondent claims that the Applicant has failed to meet the burden of establishing that he at one point satisfied the definition of refugee or person in need of protection. Indeed, the RPD found that his fear was not well founded. The Applicant had to establish a prospective risk of return, which he did not do. Furthermore, the Applicant in any event failed to demonstrate the existence of compelling reasons arising out of his persecution. Indeed, as established by his own evidence, the Applicant's psychological issues and his anxiety are all linked to the fact that is or could be separated from him mother, and not to the possibility of going back to his country.
[33]
The Respondent further submits that, to the contrary of the Applicant's submission, the RPD did consider the Applicant's case on its own merits. It actually reviewed all of the evidence submitted and considered the trauma suffered by the Applicant. In fact, the RPD was satisfied that the Applicant was a victim of abuse tantamount to persecution based on medical evidence submitted by the evidences and two psychological reports related to the Applicant's health. Given the extensive evidence which lead the RPD to determine that the Applicant's first concern was to remain with his mother, the RPD's decision was reasonable The abuse suffered will not continue if the Applicant returns to Saint Vincent because he will not live with his grandparents.
[34]
Also, on the subject of the
Guideline
3
mentioned by the Applicant, the Respondent claims that the
Guideline
was quite obviously taken into consideration and that the RPD had no obligation to mention it in its decision. In fact, the RPD went to great lengths to ensure due consideration of the Applicant's best interest.
[35]
As for the issue of state protection, the Respondent argues that the RPD was in no way obligated to determine the existence of such protection, because it was of the view that he would not be subjected to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Saint Vincent.
V.
Issues
[36]
Did the RPD err in rejecting the Applicant's claims under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA?
VI.
Standard of review
[37]
The RPD's findings with regard to the Applicant's claims under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA shall be reviewed under the standard of reasonableness as they constitute a question of mixed fact and law (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). This Court must afford deference to the RPD's findings and its intervention shall only be warranted if these findings fall outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47)
VII.
Analysis
[38]
Prior to undertaking its analysis of the issue, this Court cares to address the Applicant's argument according to which the RPD improperly applied the test for change of circumstances pursuant to paragraph 108(1)(
e
) of the IRPA, as previously cited at paragraph 23.
[39]
The Applicant's argument surely relies on paragraph 18 of the RPD's reasons which states the following:
[18] To reiterate, the tribunal believes that there is a
change of circumstances
in the sense that previously, Dondre was living without his mother and, therefore, relied upon the shelter and protection of his grandparents where he was abused. [...] [Emphasis added.]
[40]
While the Applicant's understanding of the paragraph 108(1)(
e
) test is quite correct - this provision indeed requires a significant change in the political or social situation in the country - I do not believe the RPD ever intended to base its reasoning on this test. In fact, there is no mention of paragraph 108(1)(
e
) in the decision. In my view, the RPD simply refers to a new element arising out of the Applicant's mother's claim being rejected which affects, in its opinion, the outcome of the Applicant's claim. The RPD's wording may be the same as that of the test on which the Applicant's argument relies, but I find this to be purely coincidental. The Applicant fruitlessly grasped unto the RPD's choice of words in the hope of finding an irregularity in the decision. This argument is deprived of any relevance.
[41]
As a consequence, while I recognize that the RPD referred to the issue of "compelling reasons" in its decision, I find there is no need to address the Applicant's question relating to the RPD's appreciation of "compelling reasons" pursuant to subsection 108(4) of the IRPA, as this obligation could only have been triggered had the RPD based its rejection on paragraph 108(1)(
e
) of the IRPA, which it did not. As this Court previously stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2006] FCJ No 421 [
Contreras Martinez
]:
It is clear from the wording of sub. 108(4) that it is not aimed at creating a broad obligation for the RPD to assess the existence of "compelling reasons" in every refugee claim. If a refugee claimant is neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection because the conditions of the general definition of section 96 and 97 of the IRPA are not met, then no "compelling reasons" assessment need be performed by the RPD. It is only necessary where the rejection of the claim is based on 108(1)(
e
).
[42]
Moreover, as rightly submitted by the Respondent, a 1992 Federal Court of Appeal decision,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  147 NR 317 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], regarding subsections 2(2) and 2(3) of the former
Immigration Act
, RSC 1985, c I-2, states that in order to invoke the assessment of compelling reasons, one must at some point have been considered a refugee or a person in need of protection:
It is clear, as the appellant suggests, that subsections 2(2) and 2(3) of the Immigration Act speak to the loss of status as a Convention refugee because of, inter alia, a change in material circumstance in a refugee's home nation. But those provisions in no way alter the test used to initially determine a claimant's status. It is trite law that to establish status as a Convention refugee within the meaning of the Immigration Act, one has to meet both a subjective and objective threshold. One must have a "well-founded fear of persecution".
One cannot get to the point of possibly losing one's status as a Convention refugee, i.e. subsections 2(2) and 2(3) cannot be applicable, unless one first falls within the statutory definition contained in subsection 2(1)
. [Emphasis added.]
[43]
Although <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> relates to the former version of the IRPA, this principle was reiterated by the courts following the enactment of the new IRPA (see
Contreras Martinez
, above at para 20 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2004] FCJ No 771).
[44]
In this regard, while the RPD did recognize that the Applicant has been victim of abuse tantamount to persecution, never at any point did it consider the Applicant to be a refugee or a person in need of protection. In fact, that the RPD found that the Applicant's fear was not well founded as he failed to demonstrate the existence of a prospective risk. As a matter of fact, the RPD rejected the Applicant's claim because he did not satisfy the necessary conditions in order to be considered a refugee or a person in need of protection. As such, the exception enacted in paragraph 108(1)(
e
) was not applicable and, consequently, the RPD was in no way obligated to undertake a "compelling reasons" assessment under subsection 108(4) of the IRPA.
[45]
Therefore, the only relevant issue in the present matter is whether or not it was reasonable for the RPD to reject the Applicant's claims and to find that he is neither a "refugee" within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA nor a "person in need of protection" under section 97 of the IRPA. I find that these conclusions were reasonable for the following reasons.
[46]
Regarding the RPD's finding under section 96, it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the Applicant would not have a well-founded fear of persecution, should he return to Saint- Vincent with his mother.
[47]
The Applicant's mother claims that no real change has occurred in the circumstances surrounding the Applicant and that the RPD's decision is based on speculation. However, the RPD did not speculate in rendering its decision, but rather adopted a prospective approach, which is the approach mandated by case law, as recently stated by this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (TD) emphasized the prospective nature of the "well-founded fear of persecution" pointed to by section 96 of the IRPA. At paragraph 17, he indicated:
Before turning to the cases themselves, I would observe that a Convention refugee claimant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in the future to support a Convention refugee claim. In making a claim for Convention refugee status, an individual will often advance evidence of past persecution. This evidence may demonstrate that he/she has been subjected to a pattern of persecution in his/her country of origin in the past. But this is insufficient of itself. The test for Convention refugee status is prospective, not retrospective: for example, see Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at page 215. The relevance of evidence of past persecution is that it may support a well-founded fear of persecution in the future. However, it is a finding that there is a well-founded fear of persecution in the future that is critical. [Emphasis added.]
[48]
It is a fact that at the time of the hearing all the evidence submitted was to the effect the Applicant's mother was scheduled to leave Canada in direction of Saint Vincent. Indeed, her removal has only been postponed pending the outcome of the Applicant's claim, which is imminent. The fact that the Applicant's mother is scheduled to be in Saint Vincent is crucial to the determination of this issue, as the Applicant has suffered abuse when he was separated from his mother but never while living with her. Contrary to what the Applicant suggests, this Court finds that this major paradigm shift constitutes an important change in the circumstances surrounding the Applicant's return in Saint Vincent, albeit not a change in circumstances for the purposes of paragraph 108(1)(
e
).
[49]
Moreover, as we now know the H&C Application has been made and without predicting the future, the mother and her son will be together at least for the time being.
[50]
Furthermore, the Applicant claims that the RPD fails to consider the
Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants.
However, as stated by Justice Beaudry in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 649, "[t]his argument cannot succeed as there is no obligation for the Board to mention the guidelines in its decision and the reasons show that the Board properly considered the [...] Applicant's claim". This decision relates to the Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, but this Court sees no difference as to the application of this principle to Guideline 3. What is more, the Guideline 3 requires the decision-maker to give primary consideration to the best interest of the child and, in fact, the RPD stated on numerous occasions that the main concern in the case at bar was for the Applicant to remain with his mother and to avoid future separation. Therefore, this Court finds that the RPD did not fail to consider the Guideline 3 as the reasons show that it did.
[51]
As for the RPD's finding that the Applicant is not a "person in need of protection," thereby rejecting his claim under section 97 of the IRPA, the Applicant's mother claims that the RPD failed to conduct an analysis of the state protection issue. The RPD indeed stated in its decision that state protection was not an issue in the present matter, but it did so after considering the evidence and reasonably concluding to the absence of cogent evidence that the Applicant and his mother would be subject to aggressions by the Applicant's grandfather should they return to Saint Vincent. In any event, it was certainly open to the RPD to come to such a conclusion - state protection is not a relevant matter given that there is no risk of persecution from which the state could protect the Applicant.
[52]
Moreover, about section 97, a Federal Court of Appeal decision,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] FCJ No 336, states at paras 15 and 16 that the Applicant had the burden of establishing the existence of a real and prospective risk resulting from the return and that if the Applicant has the possibility of making reasonable choices in order to free himself of harm he must do so:
[15] As such, a determination of whether a claimant is in need of protection requires an objective assessment of risk, rather than a subjective evaluation of the claimant's concerns.
Evidence of past persecution may be a relevant factor in assessing whether or not a claimant would be a risk of harm if returned to his or her country, but it is not determinative of the matter. Subsection 97(1) is an objective test to be administered in the context of a present or prospective risk for the claimant.
[16] In assessing the existence of a prospective risk, the applications judge analogized the appellants' situation to one where there is an internal flight alternative (IFA) and held that "Canada cannot and should not be a substitute refuge for those who have the option of choosing a safe haven in their home countries" (paragraph 18). Without importing the IFA test into subsection 97(1), I believe the underlying purpose of the IFA test is helpful in assessing a risk of harm. As noted by this Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at paragraph 12, "
if there is a safe haven for claimants in their own country, where they would be free of persecution, they are expected to avail themselves of it unless they can show that it is objectively unreasonable for them to do so." Similarly, claimants who are able to make reasonable choices and thereby free themselves of a risk of harm must be expected to pursue those options
. [Emphasis added.]
In the present matter, such a reasonable choice was available to the Applicant and his mother; they could avoid all persecutions by opting to reside away from the Applicant's grandfather's house. They do have a "safe haven" to "free themselves of a risk of harm." Thus it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the Applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution should he return to Saint Vincent.
[53]
The Applicant's mother also argues that the RPD's decision generally failed to consider the Applicant's claim on its own merits and focused its analysis on her case and history. Quite to the contrary, this Court finds that the RPD did consider the case on its merits. In fact, the RPD reviewed and referred to evidence submitted, including medical reports, and examined the trauma suffered by the Applicant. While it is true that the RPD gives some importance to the Applicant's mother in its decision, it was nonetheless reasonable to do so considering that, as it had reasonably been found that mother and child should not be separated, she is the reason why the Applicant would no longer be subject to persecution in Saint Vincent. This however does not amount to the RPD failing to consider the Applicant's claim on its own merits.
[54]
The Applicant's mother also puts forward the argument that the abuse suffered by her son is being minimized by the fact that he misses his friends and that he does not want to be separated from his mother. This Court finds it difficult to reconcile this affirmation with the fact that the RPD ultimately came to the conclusion, upon consideration of the evidence submitted, that the Applicant was a victim of abuse tantamount to persecution. Stating that a person is in reality a victim of abuse which amounts to persecution is quite the opposite of minimizing the problems suffered by said person.
[55]
For the aforementioned reasons, I find that the RPD's decision, as it concerns section 96 as well as section 97, was reasonable and falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law, and that this Court's intervention is not warranted.
[56]
The parties were invited to submit a question for certification but none were proposed.
JUDGMENT
[57]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed. No question is certified.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR], de la décision par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] a déterminé que Dondre Calbert Henry n'avait pas qualité de « réfugié » au sens de l'article 96 de la LIPR ni celle de « personne à protéger » au sens de l'article 97 de la LIPR.
I.
Les faits
[2]
Dondre Calbert Henry [le demandeur] est un citoyen de Saint-Vincent-et-les Grenadines [Saint-Vincent], où il est né le 23 octobre 2000.
[3]
La mère du demandeur, Michelle Hooper, a été nommée représentante désignée de son fils mineur.
[4]
Pour échapper à son propre père qui était violent, la mère du demandeur a quitté Saint-Vincent en décembre 2007. Faute de moyens financiers, elle n'a pu emmener le demandeur. Pendant que sa mère était au Canada, ce dernier est demeuré chez l'ami de sa mère, où il a été maltraité à tel point qu'un hôpital a voulu le placer sous la garde des services d'aide à l'enfance. À la demande de sa mère, le demandeur a plus tard déménagé chez les parents de celle-ci, où il a aussi été maltraité. Puis il a été confié à la sœur de sa mère, qui en a eu la garde pendant plusieurs mois, jusqu'à son arrivée au Canada.
[5]
En mai 2009, deux ans après son arrivée au Canada, la mère du demandeur a demandé l'asile au motif qu'elle était maltraitée par son propre père, qui refusait de subvenir à ses besoins financiers. Sa demande a été rejetée en février 2011 pour absence de crainte de persécution. Elle a présenté une demande de contrôle judiciaire de cette décision, mais la demande a été rejetée.
[6]
La mère du demandeur affirme être dans l'impossibilité de présenter une demande de résidence permanente pour des considérations d'ordre humanitaire [demande CH], car les coûts associés à une telle demande dépassent ses moyens financiers. Pourtant, durant l'audition du contrôle judiciaire, l'avocat du demandeur a indiqué que la mère et son fils avaient déposé une demande CH.
[7]
En juillet 2010, le demandeur a rendu visite à sa mère au Canada et y a séjourné deux mois, mais il est retourné à la résidence de ses grands-parents. Le demandeur est revenu au Canada en juillet 2011 et a demandé l'asile.
[8]
La mère du demandeur a été avisée que son renvoi du Canada aurait lieu au plus tard le 12 juillet 2012. Toutefois, elle a demandé le report de son renvoi, ce qui lui a été accordé après qu'elle eut fait valoir que son fils, le demandeur, souffrait d'anxiété causée par la séparation, qu'il ne devrait pas être séparé de sa mère et que son renvoi devait donc être reporté en attendant le résultat de la demande d'asile du demandeur.
II.
La décision contrôlée
[9]
La SPR s'est dite convaincue de l'identité du demandeur au vu des éléments de preuve présentés.
[10]
En dernière analyse, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas de crainte fondée de persécution dans l'éventualité de son retour à Saint-Vincent accompagné de sa mère et que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, il n'y serait pas personnellement exposé à une menace à sa vie ou à un risque de traitement ou de peine cruels et inusités.
[11]
Après avoir exposé les faits sur lesquels repose sa décision, la SPR a précisé qu'elle entendait tenir compte du fait que la demande d'asile de sa mère avait été rejetée, que celle-ci avait décidé de ne pas présenter une demande pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire et que son renvoi était imminent dans l'examen de la demande d'asile du demandeur.
[12]
La SPR a d'abord expliqué qu'elle déterminerait si les allégations formulées à l'égard du demandeur étaient dignes de foi et, le cas échéant, elle entendait évaluer les conséquences du retour du demandeur dans son pays d'origine.
[13]
D'une part, la SPR a conclu, sur la foi des preuves présentées, que le demandeur avait effectivement été victime de violence et de maltraitance équivalant à de la persécution à Saint-Vincent, mais d'autre part, qu'il n'existait pas de possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit persécuté ou exposé, selon toutes probabilités, à un risque pour sa vie ou à un risque de traitement ou de peine cruels et inusités s'il retournait dans son pays d'origine.
[14]
La SPR a fondé sa conclusion sur le rapport d'un médecin dans lequel il est indiqué que le demandeur craint énormément d'être séparé à nouveau de sa mère et qu'il a des amis à Saint-Vincent qui lui manquent. La SPR a insisté sur l'importance de ne pas séparer le demandeur de sa mère et a relevé que dans un avenir proche, la mère du demandeur devrait quitter le Canada. La SPR a donc conclu que les circonstances seraient très différentes si le demandeur devait retourner à Saint-Vincent. Il ne serait plus pris en charge par ses grands-parents; il serait avec sa mère. En conséquence, la SPR a jugé que le demandeur n'avait pas une crainte de persécution.
[15]
La SPR a ensuite traité de la décision rendue à l'égard de la demande d'asile de la mère du demandeur et plus particulièrement des difficultés que celle-ci a éprouvées avec son propre père. D'après cette décision, bien que le grand-père du demandeur soit un homme violent et qu'il ait rendu la vie de sa mère insupportable, il lui faisait subir des menaces parce qu'il ne voulait pas assumer la responsabilité économique de sa fille, une femme adulte. Il semble qu'il n'ait agressé aucun de ses autres enfants au cours des dernières années. Toujours d'après cette décision, il n'y aurait pas au bout du compte de possibilités sérieuses que la mère du demandeur soit agressée si elle retournait à Saint-Vincent et se gardait de retourner chez ses parents.
[16]
La SPR a aussi tenu compte du témoignage de la mère du demandeur, à savoir que lorsque son fils habitait chez la sœur de sa mère, à plusieurs villages de distance de la résidence des grands-parents du demandeur, il devait quand même passer devant cette résidence et son grand-père lui criait après. La SPR a jugé que cette partie du témoignage n'était pas crédible, puisque sa décision antérieure concernant la mère du demandeur indiquait que le grand-père de ce dernier ne cherchait pas à se venger, mais qu'il refusait simplement de soutenir sa fille financièrement.
[17]
La SPR a conclu que si le demandeur retournait à Saint-Vincent avec sa mère, lui et sa mère n'auraient pas à résider à proximité des parents de celle-ci. L'élément le plus important était d'éviter que le demandeur soit séparé de sa mère.
[18]
La SPR a ensuite abordé la question de la disponibilité de soins psychiatriques à Saint-Vincent, question qui relève de l'article 97 de la Loi. Elle a estimé que même si le demandeur reçoit d'excellents traitements au Canada, le fait que des soins psychiatriques de même qualité ne soient pas disponibles à Saint-Vincent ne constitue pas un motif de persécution, étant donné que ce risque découle de priorités financières légitimes, qui déterminent le choix de ce pays de ne pas fournir de tels soins, et non de motifs illégitimes.
[19]
De plus, la SPR a tenu compte de plusieurs éléments de preuve mis de l'avant par l'avocat du demandeur (entre autres, un rapport sur les châtiments corporels à Saint-Vincent, une étude sur la vulnérabilité de l'enfant, et un document sur les traitements et le soutien accordés aux personnes souffrant d'un état de stress post-traumatique et de problèmes de santé mentale). La SPR a conclu que ces éléments n'étaient pas pertinents en l'espèce ou qu'il s'agissait d'un refus de fournir des soins constituant de la persécution.
[20]
Enfin, la SPR a conclu que ni la question de la protection de l'État, ni la question des possibilités de refuge intérieur ne sont pertinentes dans la présente affaire.
III.
Les observations du demandeur
[21]
Le demandeur met de l'avant les quatre points suivants qui, selon lui, rendent la décision de la SPR déraisonnable: 1) la SPR a appliqué de façon inappropriée le critère du « changement de circonstances » prévu à l'alinéa 108(1)
e
) de la LIPR; 2) elle a eu tort de statuer qu'il n'y avait pas de raisons impérieuses d'accepter la demande d'asile du demandeur par application du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR; 3) la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant que le demandeur n'aurait pas à craindre la persécution s'il retournait à Saint-Vincent avec sa mère; 4) la SPR ne s'est pas prononcée sur le fond de la demande d'asile du demandeur.
[22]
Le demandeur fait d'abord valoir que la SPR n'a pas appliqué de façon appropriée le critère du « changement de circonstances » prévu à l'alinéa 108(1)
e
) de la LIPR. La SPR a reconnu que le demandeur a été victime de violences équivalant à de la persécution; toutefois, malgré cette reconnaissance, elle a conclu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il n'était pas exposé à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ou à un risque de traitement ou de peine cruels et inusités s'il retournait à Saint-Vincent, en raison d'un changement de circonstances, à savoir qu'il serait avec sa mère. La SPR a constaté que la mère du demandeur devait retourner à Saint-Vincent parce que son renvoi n'avait été que reporté et qu'elle n'avait pas présenté de demande d'asile pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire. Bien qu'elle ait voulu se garder de spéculer sur ce qui se passerait à l'avenir, c'est exactement ce que la SPR a fait. De fait, au moment où la SPR a rendu sa décision, la mère du demandeur était encore au Canada et il n'y avait pratiquement pas eu de changement de circonstances.
[23]
De plus, le demandeur invoque le critère énoncé à l'alinéa 108(1)
e
) de la LIPR servant à déterminer s'il s'est produit un « changement de circonstances ». Selon le libellé de cette disposition, le changement doit déjà avoir eu lieu.
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
LC 2001, ch. 27
Rejet
108. (1)
Est rejetée la demande d'asile et le demandeur n'a pas qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger dans tel des cas suivants:
[...]
e) les raisons qui lui ont fait demander l'asile n'existent plus.
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27
Rejection
108. (1)
A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:
[...]
(
e
) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.
[24]
Qui plus est, il est établi dans la jurisprudence que le rejet d'une demande sur la base d'un « changement de circonstances » suppose un changement significatif de la situation politique ou sociale dans le pays, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'espèce. Le demandeur est donc d'avis que la SPR a appliqué de façon inappropriée le critère du « changement de circonstances », et qu'il n'y avait pas de changement de ce genre en l'espèce.
[25]
Deuxièmement, le demandeur soutient qu'outre l'application inappropriée de ce critère, la SPR a commis une erreur en déterminant qu'il n'y avait pas de raisons impérieuses d'accepter la demande d'asile du demandeur en application du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR, comme elle y était tenue, puisqu'il était reconnu que le demandeur avait été victime de maltraitance équivalant à de la persécution. La disposition se lit comme suit:
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
LC 2001, ch. 27
Exception
108. (4)
L'alinéa (1)
e
) ne s'applique pas si le demandeur prouve qu'il y a des raisons impérieuses, tenant à des persécutions, à la torture ou à des traitements ou peines antérieurs, de refuser de se réclamer de la protection du pays qu'il a quitté ou hors duquel il est demeuré.
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27
Exception
108. (4)
Paragraph (1)(
e
) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.
[26]
Le demandeur affirme qu'il conserve des séquelles de la maltraitance, même s'il vit maintenant avec sa mère, et qu'un retour dans son pays d'origine compromettrait sa santé psychologique, compte tenu de son âge, du traumatisme subi, de sa souffrance morale et émotionnelle permanente, etc. En arrivant à une conclusion différente, la SPR a soit ignoré la preuve documentaire présentée, soit nié fallacieusement la souffrance subie par le demandeur. Cette erreur rend la décision de la SPR déraisonnable.
[27]
À titre de troisième argument, le demandeur soutient qu'il était déraisonnable pour la SPR de conclure qu'il n'éprouverait pas une crainte subjective de persécution s'il retournait à Saint-Vincent avec sa mère, alors que la SPR a reconnu qu'il avait été victime de violences équivalant à de la persécution. La SPR a insisté sur l'importance que le demandeur reste avec sa mère. Le demandeur prétend que la SPR minimise la violence dont il a été victime au motif que ses amis lui manquent et qu'il ne veut pas être séparé de sa mère, des sentiments qu'il est raisonnable qu'un enfant exprime dans ces circonstances. Il ajoute que dans sa décision, la SPR n'a pas pris en compte les vulnérabilités particulières aux enfants et les
Directives no 3: Les enfants qui revendiquent le statut de réfugié
[
Directives no 3
], qui servent à déterminer la crainte subjective chez un enfant.
[28]
Enfin, le demandeur fait observer que la SPR ne s'est pas prononcée sur le fond de la demande et qu'elle n'a pas procédé à une analyse de la protection de l'État. Il ajoute que la SPR s'est engagée dans une analyse des risques associés au retour de la mère à Saint-Vincent et non à celui du demandeur lui-même, et qu'elle a conclu que la mère et le fils ne subiraient pas de préjudice à l'avenir parce qu'ils seraient réunis à Saint-Vincent. Le demandeur voit mal comment la SPR peut affirmer, d'une part, que le demandeur a souffert de maltraitance équivalant à de la persécution et, d'autre part, que la protection de l'État n'est pas pertinente dans cette affaire. Il ressort clairement de la documentation présentée que la maltraitance des enfants demeure un problème répandu à Saint-Vincent en raison d'une législation [traduction] « tout à fait dépassée » et de l'absence de maisons d'accueil pour les enfants victimes de mauvais traitements. La SPR a surtout prêté attention à la demande d'asile de la mère, sans se prononcer sur le bien-fondé de la demande du demandeur. La SPR ayant reconnu comme avérée l'allégation du demandeur, une analyse en bonne et due forme de sa demande était justifiée.
IV. Les observations du défendeur
[29]
Le défendeur fait valoir qu'il était raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que le demandeur ne serait pas persécuté s'il retournait à Saint-Vincent avec sa mère, parce qu'il serait avec elle et non plus avec son grand-père, ce qui éliminerait la crainte d'être persécuté. Il ajoute que la SPR n'a pas eu tort de conclure que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré l'existence de raisons impérieuses au sens du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR.
[30]
Pour ce qui est de l'absence de crainte d'être persécuté, le défendeur fait observer que le demandeur n'a été maltraité que parce qu'il n'avait d'autre choix que de demeurer temporairement chez ses grands-parents. Lui et sa mère étant dans la même situation, la maltraitance cesserait s'ils quittaient la résidence du grand-père. De plus, tous les éléments de preuve présentés indiquent que le renvoi de la mère du demandeur n'a été reporté qu'en attendant le résultat de la demande d'asile du demandeur. Ce renvoi était imminent et, considérant à quel point ce fait est vital pour la demande du demandeur, la SPR n'avait d'autre choix que de constater que la mère était sur le point de quitter le pays, ce qui signifiait la réunion de la mère et du fils.
[31]
Le demandeur n'a pas réussi à établir l'existence d'un risque réel ou prospectif de persécution s'il retournait au pays. De plus, s'il est en mesure de faire un choix raisonnable pour éviter d'être persécuté dans son pays, le demandeur doit retenir cette option. Or, c'est le cas en l'espèce, puisque le demandeur et sa mère pourraient simplement décider de résider n'importe où ailleurs que chez leurs agresseurs.
[32]
Pour ce qui est de l'absence de raisons impérieuses au sens du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR, le défendeur soutient que le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté du fardeau qui lui incombait d'établir qu'il répondait, au moins sur un point, à la définition de réfugié ou de personne à protéger. De fait, la SPR a estimé que sa crainte d'être persécuté n'était pas fondée. Le demandeur avait l'obligation de démontrer un risque de persécution s'il retournait au pays, ce qu'il n'a pas fait. De toute façon, le demandeur n'a pas démontré l'existence de raisons impérieuses tenant à des persécutions. En fait, comme l'indiquent ses propres éléments de preuve, les problèmes psychologiques du demandeur et son inquiétude sont tous liés à l'éventualité d'être séparé de sa mère, et non à celle de son retour au pays.
[33]
Le défendeur soutient par ailleurs que, contrairement à ce que prétend le demandeur, la SPR s'est bel et bien prononcée sur le bien-fondé de la demande. Elle a effectivement examiné tous les éléments de preuve présentés et tenu compte du traumatisme subi par le demandeur. La SPR croit que le demandeur est réellement une victime de maltraitance équivalant à de la persécution au vu de la preuve médicale versée au dossier et des deux rapports psychologiques relatifs à la santé du demandeur. Compte tenu de la preuve abondante qui a amené la SPR à déterminer que la principale préoccupation du demandeur était de rester avec sa mère, la décision de la SPR était raisonnable. La maltraitance dont le demandeur a souffert ne se poursuivra pas s'il retourne à Saint-Vincent, parce qu'il ne résidera pas chez ses grands-parents.
[34]
De plus, au sujet des
Directives no
3
mentionnées par le demandeur, le défendeur estime qu'à l'évidence ces
Directives
ont été prises en considération et que la SPR n'était aucunement tenue de les mentionner dans sa décision. De fait, la SPR a fait tout ce qui était en son pouvoir pour tenir compte de l'intérêt supérieur du demandeur.
[35]
Quant à la protection de l'État, le défendeur soutient que la SPR n'était nullement tenue de déterminer l'existence d'une telle protection, puisqu'elle estimait que le demandeur ne serait pas exposé à une menace à sa vie ou à un risque de traitement ou de peine cruels et inusités s'il retournait à Saint-Vincent.
V.
La question en litige
[36]
La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur en rejetant la demande d'asile du demandeur fondée sur les articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR?
VI.
La norme de contrôle applicable
[37]
Les conclusions de la SPR au regard de la demande d'asile du demandeur fondée sur les articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR doivent être examinées selon la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable en ce qu'elles constituent une question mixte de fait et de droit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 47). La Cour doit faire preuve de retenue envers les conclusions de la SPR, et son intervention ne peut être justifiée que si ces conclusions n'appartiennent pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47).
VII.
L'analyse
[38]
Avant d'entreprendre l'analyse de la question en litige, la Cour souhaite disposer de l'argument du demandeur à savoir que la SPR a appliqué de façon inappropriée le critère relatif au changement de circonstances énoncé à l'alinéa 108(1)
e
) de la LIPR, reproduit au paragraphe 23.
[39]
L'argument du demandeur repose uniquement sur le passage suivant du paragraphe 18 des motifs de la SPR, qui se lit comme suit:
[18] Le tribunal répète que
les circonstances ont changé
. Auparavant, Dondre vivait à Saint-Vincent-les Grenadines sans sa mère. Il dépendait donc de ses grands-parents pour son gîte et sa protection, mais ceux-ci le maltraitaient. [...] [Je souligne.]
[40]
J'estime que le demandeur interprète correctement le critère de l'alinéa 108(1)
e
) soit - cette disposition suppose de fait un changement important dans la situation politique et sociale au pays -, mais je ne crois pas que la SPR ait voulu fonder son raisonnement sur ce critère. D'ailleurs, la décision ne fait aucune mention de l'alinéa 108(1)
e
). À mon sens, la SPR fait simplement référence à un nouvel élément, tenant au rejet de la demande d'asile de la mère du demandeur, rejet qui, selon la SPR, a une incidence sur la demande d'asile du demandeur. Dans la mesure où la SPR a employé la terminologie du critère sur lequel repose l'argument du demandeur, j'estime qu'il s'agit d'une coïncidence. Le demandeur a en vain relevé les termes choisis par la SPR dans l'espoir de découvrir une irrégularité dans la décision. L'argument en question est dépourvu de toute pertinence.
[41]
En conséquence, bien que je reconnaisse que la SPR a effectivement fait mention de la question des « raisons impérieuses » dans sa décision, je ne vois pas la nécessité de répondre à l'argument du demandeur concernant l'examen par la SPR des « raisons impérieuses » visées au paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR. La SPR aurait été tenue de les examiner uniquement si elle avait fondé son rejet sur l'alinéa 108(1)
e
) de la LIPR, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Comme notre Cour l'a établi dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 421 [
Contreras Martinez
], au paragraphe 21:
Le libellé du paragraphe 108(4) indique clairement qu'il n'a pas pour but d'imposer à la SPR une large obligation d'examiner l'existence de « raisons impérieuses » dans chaque demande d'asile. Lorsqu'un demandeur d'asile n'est ni un réfugié ni une personne à protéger parce que les conditions exposées dans la définition générale figurant aux articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR ne sont pas remplies, la SPR n'est nullement tenue de procéder à un examen des « raisons impérieuses ». Cela n'est nécessaire que lorsque la demande est rejetée aux termes de l'alinéa 108(1)
e
).
[42]
De plus, comme l'a fait justement observer le défendeur, un arrêt de 1992 de la Cour d'appel fédérale,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  147 NR 317 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], concernant les paragraphes 2(2) et 2(3) de l'ancienne
Loi sur l'immigration
, LRC 1985, c I-2, indique que pour invoquer l'évaluation des raisons impérieuses, un justiciable doit à un certain moment avoir eu qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger:
Il est évident, comme le laisse entendre l'appelant, que les paragraphes 2(2) et 2(3) de la
Loi sur l'immigration
traitent de la perte du statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention, en raison notamment du changement d'un fait pertinent survenu dans le pays dont le réfugié a la nationalité. Toutefois, ces dispositions ne changent en rien le critère utilisé pour déterminer initialement le statut d'un revendicateur. Il est de droit constant que pour obtenir le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention au sens accordé à cette expression par la
Loi sur l'immigration
, il faut respecter, à la fois, un critère de subjectivité et d'objectivité. On doit « craindre avec raison d'être persécuté ».
On ne peut en arriver à la possibilité de perdre son statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention, c'est-à-dire que les paragraphes 2(2) et 2(3) ne peuvent s'appliquer, que si l'on est tout d'abord visé par la définition de la loi au paragraphe 2(1)
. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[43]
Bien que l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> renvoie à l'ancienne version de la LIPR, ce principe a été confirmé par les tribunaux après l'adoption de la nouvelle LIPR (voir
Contreras Martinez
, précitée, au paragraphe 20, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] ACF no 771), au paragraphe 5.
[44]
À cet égard, bien que la SPR ait reconnu que le demandeur a été victime de maltraitance équivalant à de la persécution, elle n'a jamais considéré qu'il avait qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger. En fait, la SPR a conclu que la crainte du demandeur n'était pas fondée puisqu'il n'avait pas démontré l'existence d'un risque éventuel. De fait, la SPR a rejeté la demande du demandeur au motif qu'il ne satisfaisait pas aux conditions nécessaires pour être considéré comme un réfugié ou une personne à protéger. L'exception énoncée à l'alinéa 108(1)
e
) n'était pas applicable et la SPR n'était nullement tenue de procéder à une évaluation des « raisons impérieuses » visées au paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR.
[45]
Ainsi donc, la seule question pertinente en l'espèce est de savoir s'il était raisonnable pour la SPR de rejeter les arguments du demandeur et de conclure qu'il n'avait qualité ni de « réfugié » au sens l'article 96 de la LIPR, ni de « personne à protéger » au sens de l'article 97 de la LIPR. Je suis d'avis que ces conclusions étaient raisonnables pour les motifs ci-après.
[46]
Quant à la conclusion de la SPR fondée sur l'article 96, il était raisonnable de juger que le demandeur ne craindrait pas avec raison d'être persécuté s'il retournait à Saint-Vincent avec sa mère.
[47]
La mère du demandeur prétend qu'aucun changement réel n'est survenu dans la situation du demandeur et que la décision de la SPR se fonde sur des conjectures. Or, tel n'est pas le cas; la SPR a plutôt adopté une approche prospective, l'approche retenue dans la jurisprudence, et notamment par notre Cour dans la récente décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1re inst.), a souligné la nature prospective du critère servant à déterminer si une personne craint « avec raison d'être persécutée », mis en avant par l'article 96 de la LIPR. Au paragraphe 17, il a mentionné:
Avant d'examiner cette jurisprudence, je tiens à rappeler que toute personne revendiquant le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention doit démontrer, à l'appui de sa demande, qu'elle craint avec raison d'être persécutée à l'avenir. Les preuves ainsi produites peuvent établir que la personne en cause a, dans le passé, fait l'objet de persécutions systématiques, dans son pays d'origine. Mais, en soi, cela ne suffit pas. En effet, le critère applicable aux fins du statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention est un critère prospectif et non pas rétrospectif. Voir, par exemple,
Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.), à la page 215. S'il est important de démontrer l'existence de persécutions passées, c'est parce que cela sert de fondement à la crainte d'être persécutée à l'avenir.
Ce qui compte vraiment, cependant, c'est de convaincre qu'on craint avec raison d'être persécuté à l'avenir
. [Je souligne.]
[48]
C'est un fait qu'au moment de l'audience, tous les éléments de preuve indiquaient qu'il était prévu que la mère du demandeur retourne à Saint-Vincent. Effectivement, son renvoi n'a été reporté qu'en attendant le résultat de la demande du demandeur, lequel est imminent. Le fait que le retour de la mère du demandeur à Saint-Vincent soit prévu est crucial pour disposer de l'espèce, puisque le demandeur a souffert de maltraitance lorsqu'il était séparé de sa mère, mais jamais pendant qu'il demeurait avec elle. Contrairement à ce que le demandeur laisse entendre, notre Cour est d'avis que ce changement majeur de paradigme constitue un changement important dans les circonstances entourant le retour du demandeur à Saint-Vincent, mais pas un changement dans les circonstances au sens de l'alinéa 108(1)
e
).
[49]
Cependant, comme nous le savons maintenant, la demande d'asile pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire a été déposée et, sans prétendre prédire l'avenir, on peut conclure que la mère et son fils seront ensemble, du moins pour l'instant.
[50]
De plus, le demandeur soutient que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte des
Directives no 3: Les enfants qui revendiquent le statut de réfugié.
Toutefois, comme l'a indiqué le juge Beaudry dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 649, au paragraphe 14, « [c]et argument ne peut être retenu, puisque la Commission n'a aucune obligation de mentionner les directives dans sa décision et les motifs montrent qu'elle a dûment pris en compte la prétention de la demanderesse ». Cette décision a trait aux Directives no 4: Revendicatrices du statut de réfugié craignant d'être persécutées en raison de leur sexe, mais notre Cour estime que ce principe s'applique tout autant aux Directives no 3. Qui plus est, les Directives no 3 enjoignent le décideur de placer au premier rang l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant et, de fait, la SPR a indiqué à plusieurs occasions que la principale préoccupation en l'espèce était que le demandeur reste avec sa mère et qu'on évite une séparation. Notre Cour est donc d'avis, comme il ressort de ses motifs, que la SPR a bel et bien tenu compte des Directives no 3.
[51]
Quant au fait que la SPR conclut que le demandeur n'est pas une « personne à protéger », rejetant par là son argument fondé sur l'article 97 de la LIPR, la mère du demandeur affirme que la SPR n'a pas procédé à une analyse de la question de la protection de l'État. Effectivement, la SPR a indiqué dans sa décision que la question de la protection de l'État n'était pas en litige en l'espèce, mais elle l'a fait après avoir considéré les éléments de preuve et raisonnablement conclu à l'absence de preuve convaincante démontrant que le demandeur et sa mère seraient agressés par le grand-père du demandeur s'ils retournaient à Saint-Vincent. Quoi qu'il en soit, il était certainement loisible à la SPR d'arriver à une telle conclusion; la protection de l'État n'est pas une question pertinente, étant donné qu'il n'y a pas de risque de persécution contre lequel l'État pourrait protéger le demandeur.
[52]
De plus, pour ce qui est de l'article 97, un arrêt de la Cour d'appel fédérale,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 336, indique aux paragraphes 15 et 16, qu'il incombe au demandeur de démontrer l'existence de risques réels et prospectifs advenant son retour au pays et que si le demandeur peut faire des choix raisonnables et se soustraire aux préjudices, il a l'obligation de le faire:
[15] Pour décider si un demandeur d'asile a qualité de personne à protéger, il faut se fonder sur une évaluation objective des risques et non sur une évaluation subjective des inquiétudes éprouvées par le demandeur d'asile.
Les preuves concernant les persécutions dont il a pu faire l'objet dans le passé peuvent être un facteur pertinent lorsqu'il s'agit de décider si le demandeur d'asile s'exposera à des risques s'il rentre dans son pays, mais ces preuves ne sont pas concluantes. Le paragraphe 97(1) prévoit un critère objectif à appliquer dans le contexte des risques actuels ou prospectifs auxquels serait exposé le demandeur d'asile.
[16] Pour déterminer l'existence d'un risque prospectif, le juge des requêtes a établi un parallèle entre la situation dans laquelle se trouvent les appelants et la situation où il y aurait une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI). Il a estimé que « Le Canada ne peut pas et ne devrait pas servir de refuge substitut aux personnes qui ont la possibilité de se trouver un refuge dans leur pays d'origine » (paragraphe 18). Sans incorporer au paragraphe 97(1) le critère de la PRI, j'estime que la finalité de ce critère aide à évaluer les risques possibles. Comme la Cour l'a révélé dans l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), au paragraphe 12, «
s'il existe dans leur propre pays un refuge sûr où ils ne seraient pas persécutés, les demandeurs de statut sont tenus de s'en prévaloir à moins qu'ils puissent démontrer qu'il est objectivement déraisonnable de leur part de le faire ». De façon analogue, s'agissant de demandeurs d'asile capables d'opérer des choix raisonnables et de se soustraire par là même à certains risques, on peut s'attendre à ce qu'ils optent pour une telle solution.
[Je souligne.]
En l'espèce, un tel choix s'offrait au demandeur et à sa mère; ils pouvaient éviter la persécution en choisissant de résider loin de la résidence du grand-père du demandeur. Ils disposent effectivement d'un « refuge sûr » pour « se soustraire par là même à certains risques ». Il était donc raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que le demandeur ne craindrait pas avec raison d'être persécuté s'il retournait à Saint-Vincent.
[53]
La mère du demandeur soutient aussi que dans sa décision, la SPR n'a pas évalué de façon générale le fond de la demande du demandeur, s'attachant surtout à analyser son cas et ses antécédents à elle. Bien au contraire, notre Cour estime que la SPR a effectivement statué sur le fond de la demande. La SPR a examiné et mentionné les éléments de preuve présentés, notamment les rapports médicaux, et évalué le traumatisme subi par le demandeur. Certes, la SPR a accordé une certaine importance à la mère du demandeur dans sa décision, mais il était raisonnable de le faire étant donné qu'elle avait raisonnablement conclu que la mère et l'enfant ne devaient pas être séparés, et que c'est à cause de la présence de la mère que le demandeur ne ferait plus l'objet de persécutions à Saint-Vincent. Il ne s'ensuit pas que la SPR a omis de se prononcer sur le fond de la demande du demandeur.
[54]
La mère du demandeur fait aussi valoir que la SPR minimise le préjudice subi par son fils du fait que ses amis lui manquent et qu'il ne veut pas être séparé de sa mère. Notre Cour a du mal à concilier cette affirmation avec le fait que la SPR est finalement venue à la conclusion, après examen des éléments de preuve présentés, que le demandeur était une victime de maltraitance équivalant à de la persécution. Le fait d'affirmer qu'une personne est effectivement victime de maltraitance qui équivaut à de la persécution est tout le contraire de minimiser les difficultés éprouvées par cette personne.
[55]
Pour les motifs qui précèdent, je suis d'avis que la décision de la SPR, en ce qui a trait à l'article 96 de même qu'à l'article 97, est raisonnable et qu'elle appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit, et que l'intervention de notre Cour n'est pas justifiée.
