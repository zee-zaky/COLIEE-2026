LeBlanc, J.
: The Applicant (or Mr. Avagyan) seeks judicial review of a decision dated March 6, 2013, by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the RPD) found that he was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
(the Act) respectively.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, Mr. Avagyan's application for judicial review is dismissed.
I. Background
A.
Mr. Avagyan's Refugee Protection Claim
[3]
Mr. Avagyan is a citizen of Armenia. He practiced medicine as an obstetrician starting in 1988 up to a few weeks prior to his departure for Canada in September 2011. In the course of his work he became involved, early in the year 2000, in working to expose corruption in the Ministry of Health and Education (the Ministry). In particular, he became involved with a group known as the Anti-Corruption Participatory Monitoring Methodology for Health and Education Sector Working Group (the Working Group). This group, in concert with non-governmental organisations, prepared documentary material on practices that were corrupt and suggesting ways to monitor and minimize such practices. This was part of the government's Anti-Corruption Strategy adopted in 2003. The Working Group was comprised of fifteen members.
[4]
Mr. Avagyan alleges that, in April 2006, he and his family were threatened in retaliation for his involvement in exposing corruption within the Ministry. This involvement, according to Mr. Avagyan, lead to him being physically assaulted by unknown individuals on two occasions, in May and June 2006. Mr. Avagyan pursued his activities with the Working Group despite these threats and assaults, which necessitated his hospitalization on both occasions,
[5]
Late in 2010 and early 2011, Mr. Avagyan presented to the Minister of Health and Education evidence of unsafe conditions and of corrupted practices at the hospital where he was working. Mr. Avagyan claims that, in March 2011, his home was searched by armed individuals who introduced themselves as national security and that he was brought to a police station where he was held for two days, and at some point, beaten. This, too, required his hospitalization. He alleges that, shortly after that incident, he wrote a letter to the General Prosecutor's Office about what had just happened to him and that he only received an "artificial response".
[6]
Mr Avagyan says that following the incident with the armed individuals, and once released from hospital, he started giving speeches at different medical centers and that he also appeared on a television talk show to address the corruption problem within the Ministry. On June 4, 2011, he gave a speech at a political event and, on that same day, he claims that his home was invaded once again by men unknown to him who beat him and even stabbed him.
[7]
Following his release from hospital thirteen days later, he alleges he hid the best he could and departed for Canada on September 12, 2011 as he feared persecution from government authorities for his anti-corruption work. He applied for refugee protection soon after his arrival in Canada.
B.
The Decision Under Review
[8]
The RPD dismissed Mr. Avagyan's refugee protection claim on credibility and state protection grounds.
(1) Credibility
[9]
Although the RPD accepted that Mr. Avagyan was a doctor involved in exposing corruption within the Ministry, it made adverse credibility findings based on Mr. Avagyan's incoherent choices for someone fearing for his life. The RPD found incongruous that Mr. Avagyan:
a. Continued, without repercussion, to work as a doctor exposing corruption in the government for five years after realizing, in the Spring of 2006, that his life was at risk  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
b. Traveled extensively abroad after the moment he indicated starting to fear for his life, always departing and returning safely to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  work exposing corruption throughout those years as well;
d. Applied for a Canadian Visa in late June, 2011 while, during that time, he would not have been able to do so due to his health condition and his hospitalization for post-operative procedures.
[10]
Furthermore, the RPD did not believe that Mr. Avagyan was attacked by persons affiliated in any way with the government given the lack of credible and satisfactory evidence to that effect and the fact that there was no evidence of any other member of the Working Group being the target of attacks. In particular, it found improbable that Mr. Avagyan would be sought after by government officials or persons affiliated with the government given that he, as a member of the Working Group, was able to produce and publish findings to government officials for their review and possible government implementation and action. Also, it gave no weight to the medical reports provided by Mr. Avagyan to corroborate his evidence that he was beaten by individuals connected to the government in June 2011 as these reports provided no details concerning the manner in which his injuries were sustained.
(2) State Protection
[11]
Assuming his alleged fear of persecution to be credible, the RPD found that Mr. Avagyan was able to seek the assistance of the police and, that based on the evidence provided, the police acted appropriately. The RPD found that the evidence on record showed a good response from the Armenian authorities rather than a lack of thereof. The RPD identified that state protection need not be perfect, and therefore the mere fact that the police could not identify the individuals responsible for the 2006 attacks did not suffice to prove a lack of state protection.
[12]
Furthermore, with regard to the invasion of his residence in March and June of 2011, the RPD found that Mr. Avagyan did not collaborate with the police after submitting a complaint and did not file a court action as recommended by the authorities. Thus, the RPD found that Mr. Avagyan had elected to seek international protection before exhausting his recourses  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , something which, even assuming he had a well-founded fear of persecution upon returning to Armenia, defeated his refugee protection claim.
II. Issue
[13]
The issue to be decided in this case is whether the RPD, in concluding as it did, committed a reviewable error as contemplated by section 18.1(4) of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC, 1985, c F-7.
[14]
Determining whether a foreign national is a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Act or a person in need on protection under section 97 of the Act is a matter of mixed fact and law for which the RPD has expertise. This includes determining whether the foreign national can be protected by his or her home state from the alleged persecution. It is well settled that such determinations are to be reviewed through the lens of the reasonableness standard of review (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 89;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 22).
[15]
It is also well settled that when it comes to the credibility or plausibility of a refugee claimant's story, the RPD's findings are factual in nature and, given it's role as a trier of fact, are owed a significant amount of deference ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 89;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para12).
[16]
This means that the role of the Court is not to reweigh the evidence that was before the RPD and substitute its own findings to those of the RPD. Its role is to review the impugned decision and only interfere with it if it lacks justification, transparency and intelligibility and falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes, defensible in fact and in law (
Dunsmuir,
at para 47).
III. The Applicable Statutory Framework
[17]
In order to qualify as a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Act, the Applicant had to establish that he was a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, was outside his country of nationality and was unable, or owing to that fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.
[18]
With respect to his claim that he was also a person in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 of the Act, he had to establish that his removal to Armenia would subject him either to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture, or to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. In the latter case, he also had to establish,
inter alia
, that:
a. He was unable, or because of that risk, unwilling, to avail himself of the protection of his home state;
b. He would face such risk in every part of his home state; and
c. The risk he fears is not one that is faced generally by other individuals in or from that state.
[19]
Sections 96 and 97 of the Act are reproduced in the Annex to this judgement.
IV. Analysis
[20]
Mr. Avagyan claims that the RPD fatally erred in three ways: first, by applying the wrong legal test in determining whether he qualified as a person in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 of the Act; second by drawing unreasonable adverse credibility inferences as to his fear of persecution; and third, by concluding that he had not exhausted state protection  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  when the state itself was responsible for the March and June attacks.
A.
The Section 97 Test
[21]
Mr. Avagyan contends that section 97 of the Act requires the RPD to determine whether, on a balance of probabilities, there was a danger of torture or a risk of mistreatment upon returning to Armenia, not whether he would be tortured or mistreated. He relies in this regard on the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
According to
Li
, above, the test envisaged by section 97 is whether it is more likely than not that Mr. Avagyan would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he was to be returned to Armenia. The test was framed in these exact terms in the concluding paragraphs of the RPD decision. The fact that he RPD referred in its decision to the trial division judgment in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 261), is of no consequence as this judgment was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal.
[23]
In
Li
, the Federal Court of Appeal underlined the importance of distinguishing the standard of proof and the test to be met under section 97 of the Act. A person claiming protection under that provision is required to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he or she will face the danger or risks described therein. This involves two distinct steps. First, the RPD has to assess the evidence adduced before it for the purposes of making its factual findings. This assessment is to be done on a balance of probabilities, the standard of proof applicable. Then, based on these findings, the RPD is called upon to determine whether it is more likely than not that this person would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk of mistreatment. This is the legal test for determining whether the person is in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 (
Li
, above, at para 29).
[24]
Here, the RPD did not believe, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Avagyan was at risk  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at the hands of government agents due to his anti-corruption activities and further found that, even if he was at risk, he had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection. I see nothing in the RPD's analysis and decision in this case which departs from the approach mandated in
Li
, above.
B.
The Adverse Credibility Inferences
[25]
Mr. Avagyan challenges the reasonableness of the RPD's finding that the attacks on him were not related to his anti-corruption activities and that his fear of persecution was unfounded. In particular, he says it was unreasonable for the RPD to assess the credibility of his fear of persecution on the basis that he had continued to expose corruption for a period of five years following the Spring 2006 assaults
.
In fact, he states that what a politically motivated person should have done in such circumstances is pure speculation coming from the RPD.
[26]
I do not read the RPD's decision the same way. The RPD accepted that Mr. Avagyan was involved in exposing corruption in the Ministry and that he was attacked in 2006 and 2011. However, it found that Mr. Avagyan's fear of being persecuted because of his anti-corruption activities was not credible for two main reasons: first, because he was able to pursue these activities for a period of five years after the 2006 events without repercussion and, second, because of his continued re-availment to Armenia during that period of time.
[27]
Re-availment has been considered by this Court as proper evidence for the RPD to analyze, consider and draw inferences from.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 176, at paras 23 and following, the Court provides a thorough analysis of the case law regarding re-availment and credibility findings. In that case, the fact the refugee claimant had voluntarily return to Uzbekistan made the RPD doubt the truthfulness of her story. The Court, in support of its conclusion that the RPD had not erred in inferring that the claimant's subjective fear of persecution was undermined by the fact that she had voluntarily returned to Uzbekistan, said the following:
I think the applicant's argument does not accurately reflect the Refugee Division's finding. The Division found that it was understandable that the applicant would return to Moscow to help her son, but it noted that she also returned voluntarily to Uzbekistan. I note as well, as is indicated in the preceding recitation of the undisputed facts, that the applicant returned to Tashkent a second time in early December 1999 to pack her bags and say good-bye to her aunt. I am of the opinion that the Refugee Division was justified in casting doubt on the applicant's subjective fear in the face of her return to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Rothstein held that the Refugee Division could find a lack of subjective fear in the fact that the claimant had returned to the country in regard to which he alleged a fear of persecution.
Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer decided likewise in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC), relying on Mr. Justice Rothstein's judgment in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Rothstein J. had concluded, at paragraph 5:
That he re-availed himself of the protection of Turkey on three occasions (counsel agreed that the facts are that he had only returned to Turkey twice) and that this reflects negatively on his alleged fears. The panel stated at p. 89:
In addition, the panel must take note that you did re-avail yourself, and there's no - there appears to be no conflict in your testimony in this area - of the protection of Turkey on no less than three occasions.
You went back on three occasions. And this action itself must reflect negatively upon the voracity [sic] of your alleged fears, in our opinion, of returning now to Turkey
.
In my opinion, it was open to the panel to assess the evidence and conclude that the applicant did not have a credible basis for his claim by reason of his actions or inactions that were inconsistent with having a subjective and objective fear of persecution in Turkey. Such findings are clear and unambiguous. [Emphasis added]
[28]
Mr. Avagyan's re-availment during the period of 2006 to 2010 (of which there were 5), coupled with the fact he could pursue his anti-corruption activities during that period without repercussion, provided, in my view, sufficient grounds to the RPD to reasonably conclude that he had not established, on a balance of probabilities, his alleged fear of persecution due to these activities.
[29]
These findings were based, in my view, on permissible inferences reasonably and logically drawn from a group of facts established by the evidence, not from some speculative process applying subjective imagination (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 135).
[30]
Mr. Avagyan claims these findings are irrelevant because his fear of persecution had not arisen at that time. It only arose, he now contends before this Court, as a result of the June 2011 incident.
[31]
That position fails as it contradicts the evidence he gave before the RPD where he testified that he began fearing for his life following the 2006 incidents. In these circumstances, it was reasonably open to the RPD to find that Mr. Avagyan's re-availment, his continued anti-corruption work and the absence of consequences in the years following these incidents impacted on the overall credibility of his claim.
[32]
Even assuming his fear of persecution arose as a result of the June 2011 incident, the RPD found that there was insufficient evidence linking this incident to some desire on the part of government agents to make arrangements so as to put his life at risk because of his anti-corruption activities. It found improbable in this regard that Mr. Avagyan would be sought after by government officials or persons affiliated with the government given the fact he and his group, the Working Group, were able to produce and publish findings to government officials for their review and possible corrective action
.
[33]
The Respondent concedes that it was ill-advised on the part of the RPD to make a negative credibility finding due to the timing of Mr. Avagyan's application for a Canadian visa at the end of June 2011.
[34]
However, I agree with the Respondent that this finding was not central to the rejection of Mr Avagyan's claim. In fact, the principal ground for the rejection pivots on the evidence adduced which did not establish the crucial fact that the government was targeting him.
[35]
The two medical reports, dated June 20, 2011 and September 8, 2011, do describe the injuries sustained by Mr. Avagyan, the date of his hospitalization (June 4, 2011), and the post-operative care that was needed following his discharge from hospital on June 22, 2011. It was probably too much to ask Mr. Avagyan to produce reports describing the source of his injuries. However, it was open to the RPD, in my view, to find that these reports did not assist Mr. Avagyan in establishing the central foundation of his claim.
[36]
Finally, Mr. Avagyan claims that the RPD, by requiring that it be "convinced" that government officials would be so concerned with his corruption criticisms that they would make arrangements to put his life at risk, imposed on him an excessive burden of proof. I agree with the Respondent that this statement on the part of the RPD was part of the assessment of the facts of the case and not a statement regarding the applicable legal test.
[37]
As I have already indicated, the RPD applied, in my view, the correct legal test in determining whether Mr. Avagyan was a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Act: it assessed, on a balance of probabilities, the evidence adduced by Mr. Avagyan for the purposes of making its factual findings; then it assessed whether these facts placed him at risk of persecution (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 14-15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 11 at para 70;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), the use of the word "convinced", in the context in which it was used, does not suggest that a different legal test has been applied in this case.
[39]
I therefore see no reason to interfere with the RPD's finding that Mr. Avagyan did not establish that it is more likely than not that he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk of mistreatment if he were to return to Armenia. This finding was, in my view, open to the RPD to make based on the evidence adduced before it. Again, the role of this Court is not to reweigh the evidence and to prefer its own finding to that of the RPD. It is rather, to determine whether the RPD's finding is transparent and intelligible and falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes, defensible in fact and in law. I believe it does.
C.
State Protection
[40]
It is worth reminding that international refugee law was developed to serve as a "back-up" to the protection one should expect from one's home state and that it was meant to come into play "only when that protection is unavailable, and then only in certain situations" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the principle that refugee protection is meant to be a form a surrogate protection to be invoked only in situations where the refugee claimant has unsuccessfully sought protections of his home state, must be the starting point of any refugee protection claim assessment ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 41). This is because there has to be an objective basis to a refugee protection claimant's fear of persecution and that in establishing that objective basis, the pivotal step is to assess whether that person can be protected from the alleged persecution by his or her home state ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 42).
[42]
In this regard, international refugee law provides that, absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, nations are presumed capable of protecting their citizens and that to rebut that presumption, "clear and convincing evidence" of the state's inability to protect must be provided by the refugee protection claimant (
Ward
, above, at p. 724-725; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 43-44).
[43]
Here, the RPD, assuming that Mr. Avagyan had established his alleged fear of persecution, found that he had not rebutted the presumption that Armenia would be able and willing to protect him from the alleged fear.
[44]
Mr. Avagyan says that the presumption is rebutted when the alleged persecutor is the state itself. Here, he contends that both the March and June 2011 incidents involved the police and that, as a result, he was not required to exhaust all avenues of protection.
[45]
The Respondent argues that the facts of this case are important as the RPD found that Mr. Avagyan did go to the police and authorities, that the police and authorities appeared willing to act and, in fact, did take action by informing Mr. Avagyan that there were other avenues available to him with respect to his complaint regarding the March 2011 incident and also, by inviting him to provide further details as to the circumstances of the June 2011 incident.
[46]
The Respondent further refers to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, for the proposition that the presumption of state protection applies both where a refugee protection claimant alleges a fear of persecution by a non-state entity and to cases where the state is the alleged persecutor.
[47]
Indeed, there was evidence before the RPD of efforts made by the state authorities to protect Mr. Avagyan, both with respect to the 2006 incidents and 2011 incidents. It is well settled also that state protection need not to be perfect and that failures of local law enforcement do not amount to a lack of state protection (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at para 5;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[48]
The burden of proof that rests on a refugee protection claimant to rebut the presumption of state protection will vary according to the level of democracy in his home state (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
, at p. 534 (FCA)). In reaching that conclusion, I considered the country documentation that was before the RPD and the fact that Armenia is an emerging democracy. I nevertheless find that, viewed through the lens of the reasonableness standard of review, the evidence before the RPD did not establish that Mr. Avagyan exhausted all avenue of state protection  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  before he elected to seek international protection. Again, my task in not to determine whether this finding is right or wrong or well-founded or ill-founded in light of the evidence on record, but whether it is reasonable based on the principles established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. I find that it is.
[49]
No question was proposed for certification by the parties.
JUDGMENT
[50]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
2. No question is certified.

Contexte
A.
Demande d'asile de M. Avagyan
[3]
Monsieur Avagyan est un citoyen de l'Arménie. De 1988 jusqu'à quelques semaines avant son départ pour le Canada en septembre 2011, il a exercé la médecine à titre d'obstétricien. Dans le cadre de son travail il a participé, au début de 2000, à des efforts visant à dénoncer la corruption au sein du ministère de la Santé et de l'Éducation (le ministère). Plus précisément, il s'est associé à un groupe connu sous le nom de Groupe de travail sur les méthodes de suivi participatif de la lutte contre la corruption dans le secteur de la santé et de l'éducation (le groupe de travail). Ce groupe, de concert avec des organisations non gouvernementales, a rédigé des documents traitant des pratiques de corruption et proposant diverses façons de surveiller et de réduire au minimum ces pratiques. Le groupe s'inscrivait dans la stratégie de lutte contre la corruption adoptée en 2003 par le gouvernement. Le groupe de travail comptait quinze membres.
[4]
Monsieur Avagyan allègue qu'en avril 2006, des menaces de représailles ont été proférées contre les membres de sa famille et lui-même en raison du rôle qu'il jouait dans la dénonciation des pratiques de corruption au ministère. Monsieur Avagyan affirme que ce rôle lui a aussi valu d'être agressé à deux reprises, en mai et en juin 2006, par des inconnus. Il aurait continué de participer aux activités du groupe de travail, malgré ces menaces et ces deux agressions, chacune ayant nécessité son hospitalisation.
[5]
À la fin de 2010 et au début de 2011, M. Avagyan a présenté au ministre de la Santé et de l'Éducation des éléments de preuve quant à l'existence de conditions dangereuses et de pratiques de corruption à l'hôpital où il travaillait. Il soutient qu'en mars 2011, des individus armés, disant relever des services de sécurité nationale, ont perquisitionné son domicile, et l'ont conduit au poste de police où il est resté détenu deux jours et, à un certain moment, battu. À la suite de cette agression, il a également dû être hospitalisé. Monsieur Avagyan allègue que peu après cet incident il a envoyé une lettre décrivant les événements survenus au Bureau du Procureur général, et qu'on y avait simplement donné suite au moyen d'une [traduction] « réponse toute faite ».
[6]
Monsieur Avagyan affirme qu'après l'incident causé par les individus armés, puis sa sortie de l'hôpital, il a commencé à prononcer des discours dans différents centres médicaux et il a participé à une émission-débat, où il parlait du problème de corruption sévissant au sein du ministère. Monsieur Avagyan a prononcé un discours lors d'une activité politique le 4 juin 2011 et le même jour, selon ses dires, des inconnus ont à nouveau fait irruption chez lui, l'ont tabassé et l'ont même poignardé.
[7]
Monsieur Avagan affirme qu'après son congé de l'hôpital, quelque treize jours plus tard, il a fait de son mieux pour se cacher puis il est parti à destination du Canada le 12 septembre 2011, vu sa crainte que les autorités gouvernementales ne le persécutent en raison de ses activités de lutte contre la corruption. Il a demandé l'asile peu après son arrivée au Canada.
B.
Décision à l'examen
[8]
La SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile de M. Avagyan pour des motifs liés à la crédibilité et à la protection de l'État.
(1) Crédibilité
[9]
Bien qu'elle ait reconnu que M. Avagyan était un médecin qui participait à des efforts visant à dénoncer la corruption qui sévissait au sein du ministère, la SPR a tiré des conclusions défavorables quant à sa crédibilité, en raison de ses choix qui ne correspondaient pas à ceux d'une personne craignant pour sa vie. La SPR a jugé incongru que M. Avagyan:
a. ait continué à travailler comme médecin tout en dénonçant la corruption au sein du gouvernement, sans subir de répercussions, pendant une période de cinq ans après le printemps 2006, moment où il s'était rendu compte que sa vie était en danger en Arménie;
b. ait fait de nombreux voyages à l'étranger après le moment où il affirmait avoir commencé à craindre pour sa vie, toujours en quittant l'Arménie et en y revenant sans danger;
c. n'ait fait l'objet d'aucune menace ou agression entre 2007 et 2009, bien que pendant cette période il ait aussi dénoncé la corruption;
d. ait demandé la délivrance d'un visa canadien à la fin de juin 2011, à un moment où sa santé et un séjour à l'hôpital pour des procédures postopératoires n'auraient pas dû lui permettre de le faire.
[10]
La SPR n'a pas cru non plus que M. Avagyan avait été agressé par des personnes liées de quelque manière que ce soit au gouvernement, vu l'absence d'éléments de preuve crédibles et suffisants en ce sens et vu l'absence de preuve concernant des agressions qui auraient visé un autre membre du groupe de travail. La SPR a jugé peu probable, en particulier, que des fonctionnaires ou d'autres personnes liées au gouvernement aient pu prendre M. Avagyan pour cible alors que celui-ci, en tant que membre du groupe de travail, avait pu produire et publier des conclusions devant être examinées par les fonctionnaires afin que le gouvernement puisse éventuellement y donner suite et prendre des mesures. La SPR n'a accordé non plus aucun poids aux rapports médicaux fournis par M. Avagyan pour corroborer le fait, avancé lors de son témoignage, que des personnes liées au gouvernement l'avaient battu en juin 2011, puisqu'aucun détail n'était fourni dans ces rapports sur la cause des blessures subies.
(2) Protection de l'État
[11]
En supposant que l'allégation de crainte de persécution de M. Avagyan était crédible, la SPR a conclu qu'il avait pu obtenir l'aide des policiers et, au vu de la preuve présentée, que les policiers avaient alors convenablement agi. Selon la SPR, les éléments de preuve versés au dossier permettent de conclure que les autorités arméniennes, plutôt que de se montrer peu réceptives, avaient bien réagi aux incidents. Estimant que la protection de l'État n'avait pas à être parfaite, la SPR a conclu que le seul défaut pour les policiers de ne pas avoir retrouvé les auteurs des agressions de 2006 ne suffisait pas pour établir l'absence de protection de l'État.
[12]
La SPR a aussi conclu, quant aux intrusions dans la résidence de M. Avagyan en mars et en juin 2011, qu'il ne s'était pas montré coopératif avec les policiers après avoir formulé sa plainte et n'avait pas intenté de recours comme les autorités le lui avaient recommandé. En conséquence, la SPR a conclu que M. Avagyan avait choisi de demander la protection internationale avant d'avoir épuisé tous les recours qui s'offraient à lui en Arménie, ce qui entraîne le rejet de sa demande d'asile, même s'il avait eu une crainte fondée de persécution advenant son retour dans ce pays.
II.
Question en litige
[13]
La question à trancher en l'espèce est celle de savoir si la SPR, en concluant comme elle l'a fait, a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle pour l'un des motifs énoncés au paragraphe 18.1(4) de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC 1985, c F-7.
[14]
Déterminer si un étranger a qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention, suivant l'article 96 de la Loi, ou celle de personne à protéger, suivant l'article 97, est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui relève du domaine de compétence spécialisée de la SPR. Pour répondre à cette question, il faut également se demander si l'État d'origine peut protéger l'étranger de la persécution alléguée. Il est de jurisprudence constante que de telles décisions appellent la norme de contrôle de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 89;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 22, au paragraphe 37).
[15]
Il est également bien établi que la SPR tire, quant à la crédibilité et à la vraisemblance du récit du demandeur d'asile, des conclusions portant sur les faits et compte tenu de son rôle de juge des faits, une grande retenue doit être accordée à ces conclusions ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 89;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[16]
Le rôle de la Cour n'est donc pas d'apprécier de nouveau la preuve présentée à la SPR, ni de substituer ses conclusions à celles de la SPR. Elle est plutôt chargée d'examiner la décision contestée, et de la modifier uniquement si elle ne possède pas les attributs de la justification, de la transparence et de l'intelligibilité, ni n'appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (
Dunsmuir,
au paragraphe 47).
III.
Régime législatif applicable
[17]
Pour se voir reconnaître la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention suivant l'article 96 de la Loi, le demandeur devait démontrer qu'il craignait avec raison d'être persécuté du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de ses opinions politiques ou de son appartenance à un groupe social, qu'il se trouvait hors du pays dont il avait la nationalité et qu'il ne pouvait ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne voulait se réclamer de la protection de ce pays.
[18]
Quant à la qualité de personne à protéger suivant l'article 97 de la Loi, le demandeur devait établir que son renvoi vers l'Arménie l'exposerait au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumis soit à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture, soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités. Dans ce dernier cas, il devait établir entre autres, les éléments suivants:
a. il ne pouvait ou, du fait de ce risque, ne voulait se réclamer de la protection de son pays d'origine,
b. il serait exposé à ce risque en tout lieu de ce pays, et
c. les autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne sont généralement pas exposées à ce risque.
[19]
Les articles 96 et 97 de la Loi sont reproduits en annexe du présent jugement.
IV.
Analyse
[20]
Selon M. Avagyan, la SPR a commis trois erreurs justifiant l'annulation de sa décision: premièrement, parce qu'elle a appliqué le mauvais critère juridique pour juger de sa qualité de personne à protéger au sens de l'article 97 de la Loi; deuxièmement, parce qu'elle a tiré au sujet de sa crainte de persécution des inférences défavorables déraisonnables quant à la crédibilité; et troisièmement, parce qu'elle a conclu qu'il n'avait pas épuisé tous les moyens à sa disposition pour obtenir la protection de l'État en Arménie, alors que l'État lui-même avait été l'auteur des agressions de mars et de juin.
A.
Critère relatif à l'article 97
[21]
Monsieur Avagyan soutient que l'article 97 de la Loi requiert que la SPR examine, selon la prépondérance de la preuve, s'il serait exposé à un risque de torture ou de mauvais traitements dans l'éventualité où il devait retourner en Arménie, et non s'il allait effectivement y être victime de torture ou de mauvais traitements. Il fonde son argument sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , de la Cour d'appel fédérale.
[22]
Suivant l'arrêt
Li
, précité, le critère fondé sur l'article 97 consiste à déterminer si, selon toute probabilité, M. Avagyan sera personnellement exposé à une menace à sa vie ou à un risque de torture ou de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités s'il devait retourner en Arménie. Dans les derniers paragraphes de sa décision, la SPR a repris exactement ces mêmes termes pour formuler le critère. Le fait que la SPR ait renvoyé au jugement rendu en première instance dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 261), importe peu puisque la Cour d'appel fédérale a confirmé ce jugement.
[23]
Dans l'arrêt
Li
, la Cour d'appel fédérale a souligné l'importance de la distinction à faire entre le critère d'applicabilité de l'article 97 et la norme de preuve qu'il requiert. La personne demandant l'asile sur le fondement de cet article doit établir, selon la probabilité des probabilités, qu'elle sera exposée aux risques ou à la menace qui y sont décrits. Le processus se déroule en deux étapes distinctes. La SPR doit en premier lieu évaluer les éléments de preuve qui lui ont été présentés pour en tirer des conclusions de fait. On recourt pour cette évaluation à la norme de preuve applicable: la prépondérance des probabilités. Puis, en fonction des conclusions tirées, la SPR doit décider s'il est plus probable que le contraire que l'intéressé serait personnellement exposé à un risque de torture ou de mauvais traitements. Il s'agit du critère juridique servant à déterminer si l'intéressé a la qualité d'une personne à protéger au sens de l'article 97 (
Li
, précité, au paragraphe 29).
[24]
En l'espèce, la SPR a estimé selon la prépondérance des probabilités que M. Avagyan n'était pas exposé à un risque de persécution par les agents du gouvernement en Arménie, en raison de ses activités de lutte contre la corruption. Elle a aussi conclu que, même si M. Avagyan devait courir un risque, il n'avait pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État. Rien dans l'analyse et la décision de la SPR ne s'écarte à mes yeux de la démarche prescrite dans l'arrêt
Li
, précité.
B.
Inférences défavorables quant à la crédibilité
[25]
Monsieur Avagyan conteste qu'il ait été raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que les agressions à son endroit n'étaient pas liées à ses activités de lutte contre la corruption et que sa crainte de persécution n'était pas fondée. Il précise qu'il était déraisonnable que la SPR évalue la crédibilité de sa crainte de persécution en fonction du fait qu'il avait poursuivi ses activités de lutte contre la corruption pendant cinq ans après les agressions du printemps 2006. En fait, il affirme que la SPR a formulé de pures hypothèses lorsqu'elle a précisé ce qu'une personne politisée aurait dû faire en de telles circonstances.
[26]
Je n'interprète pas la décision de la SPR de cette manière. La SPR a reconnu que M. Avagyan avait participé à des efforts visant à dénoncer la corruption au sein du ministère et qu'il avait été agressé en 2006 et en 2010. Elle a toutefois conclu que sa crainte de persécution en raison d'activités de lutte contre la corruption n'était pas crédible pour deux motifs principaux: premièrement, il avait pu s'adonner à de telles activités pendant cinq ans sans répercussions après les événements de 2006, et deuxièmement, il s'était aussi réclamé à nouveau de la protection de l'Arménie pendant cette période.
[27]
La Cour a déjà dit estimer que le fait de se réclamer de nouveau de la protection de l'État était un élément de preuve duquel la SPR pouvait tirer des inférences et qu'elle pouvait analyser et prendre en considération. Dans le jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 176, aux paragraphes 23 et suivants, la Cour fait une analyse approfondie de la jurisprudence sur les conclusions fondées sur la crédibilité et le fait de se réclamer de nouveau de la protection de l'État. Dans cette affaire, le fait que la demandeure d'asile soit retournée volontairement en Ouzbékistan avait fait douter la SPR de la véracité de son récit. La Cour a étayé comme suit sa conclusion selon laquelle la SPR n'avait pas commis d'erreur en inférant que le fait pour la demandeure d'asile d'être retournée volontairement en Ouzbékistan permettait de douter de sa crainte subjective de persécution:
Je crois que l'argument de la demanderesse ne reflète pas exactement la conclusion de la Section du statut. La Section du statut a constaté qu'il était comprenable que la demanderesse soit retournée à Moscou pour secourir son fils, mais qu'elle soit aussi volontairement retournée en Ouzbékistan. Je note aussi, comme d'ailleurs le reflète la récitation des faits non disputés ci-haut, que la demanderesse est retournée à Tachkent une deuxième fois au début de décembre 1999 pour prendre ses bagages et faire ses adieux à sa tante. Je suis d'avis que la Section du statut était bien fondée de mettre en doute la crainte subjective de la demanderesse face à son retour en Ouzbékistan.
Dans le jugement rendu dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Rothstein a déclaré que la Section du statut pouvait conclure à l'absence de crainte subjective du fait du retour du revendicateur dans le pays à l'égard duquel il alléguait une crainte de persécution.
C'est ce qu'a décidé également madame la juge Tremblay-Lamer dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F.), en se fondant sur le jugement du juge Rothstein dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Ce dernier avait conclu ceci au paragraphe 5:
Il s'est prévalu de nouveau de la protection de la Turquie à trois reprises (les avocats ont convenu qu'il était de fait qu'il était retourné en Turquie seulement deux fois), et cela élimine le fondement des craintes qu'il a alléguées. Le tribunal s'est prononcé en ces termes à la page 89:
[traduction] En outre, le tribunal doit noter que, effectivement, vous vous êtes prévalu de nouveau, et il n'existe pas -- il semble qu'il n'existe pas de conflit à ce sujet -- de la protection de la Turquie à pas moins de trois reprises.
Vous y êtes retourné à trois occasions. Et cet acte lui-même doit nuire à la véracité de vos craintes alléguées, à notre avis, de retourner maintenant en Turquie.
À mon avis, il était loisible au tribunal d'apprécier la preuve pour conclure que la revendication du requérant était dépourvue d'un minimum de fondement en raison de ses actions ou inactions qui ne correspondaient pas au fait pour une personne d'avoir une crainte subjective et objective de persécution en Turquie. Ces conclusions sont claires et sans équivoque. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[28]
Comme M. Avagyan s'est réclamé de nouveau de la protection de l'Arménie entre 2006 et 2010 (à cinq reprises), et qu'il a pu exercer ses activités de lutte contre la corruption pendant cette période, sans répercussions, j'estime que la SPR disposait de motifs suffisants pour qu'il soit raisonnable de conclure que le demandeur n'avait pas établi, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, l'existence d'une crainte de persécution en raison de ces activités.
[29]
Ces conclusions s'appuyaient, à mon avis, sur des inférences admissibles pouvant être tirées de manière raisonnable et logique à partir d'un ensemble de faits établis en preuve, et ne faisaient pas appel, de manière hypothétique, à l'imagination subjective (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 135).
[30]
Monsieur Avagyan soutient que ces conclusions n'importent pas puisque sa crainte d'être persécuté ne s'était pas encore manifestée à l'époque, l'élément déclencheur ayant été, dit-il maintenant à la Cour, l'incident de juin 2011.
[31]
Cet argument ne peut tenir puisqu'il va à l'encontre de son propre témoignage devant la SPR, soit qu'il avait commencé à craindre pour sa vie à compter des incidents de 2006. Il était raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure, dans les circonstances, que le fait que M. Avagyan se soit réclamé de nouveau de la protection de l'État et qu'il ait poursuivi ses activités de dénonciation de la corruption, sans en subir de répercussions, pendant les années ayant suivi ces incidents influait sur la crédibilité générale de sa demande d'asile.
[32]
La SPR a d'ailleurs conclu que, même en supposant que M. Avagyan ait commencé à craindre d'être persécuté à partir de l'incident de juin 2011, il n'y avait pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour lier cet incident à un désir quelconque d'agents du gouvernement de prendre, pour sanctionner ses activités de lutte contre la corruption, des mesures pouvant mettre sa vie en danger. La SPR a jugé peu probable à cet égard que des fonctionnaires ou d'autres personnes liées au gouvernement rechercheraient M. Avagyan étant donné que celui-ci et les membres de son groupe, le groupe de travail, avaient pu produire et publier des conclusions devant être examinées par les fonctionnaires afin qu'ils puissent éventuellement prendre des mesures correctrices.
[33]
Le défendeur concède qu'il avait été inopportun pour la SPR de tirer des conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité fondées sur la date - fin du mois de juin 2011 - à laquelle M. Avagyan avait présenté une demande de visa canadien.
[34]
Toutefois, je suis d'accord avec le défendeur pour dire que cette conclusion n'était pas un élément fondamental de la décision de rejeter la demande d'asile. Le motif principal du rejet était plutôt l'insuffisance de la preuve produite pour établir un fait essentiel, soit que le gouvernement prenait M. Avagyan pour cible.
[35]
Les deux rapports médicaux, datés du 20 juin 2011 et du 8 septembre 2011, décrivent bien les blessures subies par M. Avagyan, la date de son hospitalisation (le 4 juin 2011) ainsi que les soins postopératoires qu'il a dû subir après sa sortie de l'hôpital le 22 juin 2011. C'était sans doute trop demander que de s'attendre à ce que M. Avagyan produise des rapports décrivant la cause de ses blessures. Il était toutefois loisible à la SPR de conclure, à mon avis, que les rapports produits n'établissaient pas l'élément central de la demande d'asile de M. Avagyan.
[36]
Enfin, M. Avagyan fait valoir que la SPR, en exigeant d'être « convaincue » que des fonctionnaires seraient si préoccupés par ses critiques concernant la corruption qu'ils prendraient des mesures pour mettre sa vie en danger, lui a imposé un fardeau de preuve excessif. J'estime à cet égard, comme le défendeur, que la SPR a fait cette déclaration dans le cadre de l'évaluation des faits de l'affaire, et non pour faire état du critère juridique applicable.
[37]
Ainsi que je l'ai déjà dit, j'estime que la SPR a appliqué le bon critère juridique en vue d'établir si M. Avagyan avait la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention, ou celle de personne à protéger, au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi: elle a évalué, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, la preuve produite par M. Avagyan pour en tirer des conclusions de fait, puis elle a évalué si ces faits l'exposaient à un risque de persécution (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 14 et 15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 11, au paragraphe 70;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), l'emploi du mot « convaincue » ne donne pas à croire, en contexte, que la SPR a utilisé en l'espèce un critère juridique différent.
[39]
Je ne vois donc aucune raison de modifier la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle M. Avagyan n'avait pas établi qu'il était plus probable que le contraire qu'il serait personnellement exposé à un risque de torture ou de mauvais traitements s'il devait retourner en Arménie. À mon avis, il était loisible à la SPR de tirer cette conclusion au vu de la preuve qui lui avait été présentée. Je le répète, il n'appartient pas à la Cour d'apprécier de nouveau la preuve et de substituer sa propre conclusion à celle de la SPR. Son rôle consiste plutôt à décider si la conclusion de la SPR est transparente et intelligible et appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. J'estime que la conclusion de la SPR possédait ces attributs en l'espèce.
C.
Protection de l'État
[40]
Il est bon de se rappeler que le droit international des réfugiés s'est élaboré à titre de « régime de réserve » quant à la protection qu'on peut s'attendre d'obtenir de l'État d'origine, et qu'il ne devait s'appliquer « que si la protection ne pouvait être fournie, et même alors, dans certains cas seulement » (
Canada (Procureur général) c Ward
, [1993] 2 RCS 689, à la page 709).
[41]
Ainsi que la Cour d'appel fédérale l'a déclaré dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le point de départ de l'examen de toute demande d'asile est le principe selon lequel l'asile est censé constituer une forme de protection auxiliaire, qui ne doit être invoquée que dans les cas où le demandeur d'asile a tenté en vain d'obtenir la protection de son État d'origine ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 41). Cela vient du fait que la crainte de persécution du demandeur d'asile doit être fondée objectivement, et qu'en vue d'établir ce fondement objectif, l'étape charnière de l'analyse consiste à évaluer si le demandeur peut être protégé de la persécution alléguée par son État d'origine ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 42).
[42]
Le droit international des réfugiés prévoit à cet égard que, sauf dans le cas d'un effondrement complet de l'appareil étatique, il y a lieu de présumer que tout État est capable de protéger ses citoyens et que, pour réfuter cette présomption, le demandeur d'asile doit présenter une « preuve claire et convaincante » de l'incapacité de l'État d'assurer sa protection (
Ward
, précité, aux pages 724 et 725; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 43 et 44).
[43]
La SPR a conclu en l'espèce, tout en supposant que M. Avagyan avait démontré le bien-fondé de sa crainte alléguée de persécution, qu'il n'avait pas réfuté la présomption selon laquelle l'Arménie était apte et disposée à le protéger.
[44]
Monsieur Avagyan affirme que la présomption est écartée lorsque le persécuteur allégué se trouve être l'État lui-même. Il affirme en l'espèce que la police était mêlée tant à l'incident de mars qu'à celui de juin 2011 et, de ce fait, il n'avait pas à épuiser tous les moyens à sa disposition pour obtenir une protection.
[45]
Le défendeur souligne l'importance des faits de l'espèce, qui ont conduit la SPR à conclure que M. Avagyan s'était bien adressé aux policiers et aux autorités, qui avaient semblé disposés à agir et qui avaient effectivement agi, en informant M. Avagyan de l'existence d'autres voies de recours pour sa plainte concernant l'incident de mars 2011 et en l'invitant à donner des précisions sur l'incident de juin 2011.
[46]
Le défendeur invoque également l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, pour faire valoir que la présomption de protection de l'État vaut tout autant lorsque le demandeur d'asile dit craindre d'être persécuté par une entité non étatique que par l'État lui-même.
[47]
Certains éléments de preuve présentés à la SPR permettaient d'ailleurs de constater les efforts consentis par les autorités gouvernementales pour protéger M. Avagyan lorsqu'étaient survenus les incidents tant de 2006 que de 2011. Il est de droit constant que la protection de l'État n'a pas à être parfaite et que les défaillances de la police locale n'équivalent pas à l'absence de protection de l'État (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[48]
Le fardeau de preuve dont le demandeur d'asile doit s'acquitter pour réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État est proportionnel au degré de démocratie atteint dans son État d'origine (
Kadenko,
précité, à la page 534 (CAF)). Pour tirer ma conclusion, j'ai pris en compte les documents sur la situation en Arménie dont la SPR disposait et le fait que ce pays est une démocratie naissante. J'arrive néanmoins à la conclusion que, sous l'angle de la norme de contrôle de la raisonnabilité, la preuve présentée à la SPR ne démontrait pas qu'avant de solliciter la protection internationale, M. Avagyan avait épuisé tous les moyens possibles pour obtenir la protection de l'État en Arménie. Là encore, mon rôle n'est pas de décider si la conclusion tirée est juste ou erronée, ou si elle est bien fondée ou mal fondée au vu de la preuve au dossier, mais bien de décider si elle est raisonnable en fonction des principes énoncés dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité. Elle est raisonnable, à mon avis.
