Richard, J.
[Translation]: This application for judicial review filed under ss. 18 and 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
(R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7), and s. 24(1) of the
Charter
[see footnote 1] seeks to quash a requirement to provide information and documents issued by the Minister of National Revenue through his delegate under s. 231.2(a) of the Canadian
Income Tax Act
(R.S.C. 1985 (5th supp), c. 1 as amended). The requirement, which concerned the applicant, Nick Djokich, was delivered to the Caisse populaire ukrainienne de Montréal (the Caisse) on November 17, 1994.
1. Background
[2]
The applicant is an entrepreneur who owns G & D Foods Inc. (G & D), a Canadian company that buys and sells foodstuffs. For 1990 and 1991, he reported a gross income of $57,200 and $57,950 respectively. According to information obtained by the Minister of National Revenue from the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS) following information exchanges in 1993 and 1994, Mr. Djokich received the sums of $120,954 in 1990 and $222,865 in 1991 from an American company called Colorado Meat Packers Inc. (Colorado). Since the information received from the American tax authorities seemed to indicate that the applicant had failed to report a significant part of his income in 1990 and 1991, the Minister audited his file.
[3]
In his affidavit in support of his motion, the applicant stated the following about what took place when he was confronted with this information:
[Translation] "the DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE'S representatives, Rénald St-Onge and Patrick Décarie, asked me whether I acknowledged receiving the said sums. Without any surprise or hesitation I admitted receiving them ..." (Affidavit of Nick Djokich, at para. 8.)
He argued that these sums should be characterized as a return on capital rather than as income. He also argued that the Minister cannot continue his investigation without first providing a precise audit plan that meets his expectations. For this reason, he has refused to submit his account statements and other vouchers to the Minister. After numerous attempts to obtain the information voluntarily, the Minister presented the Caisse with a requirement on November 17, 1994 requesting all the information it had about the applicant.
[4]
The chronology of events is as follows:
(1) during 1990 and 1991, the applicant did business with Colorado and received sums that he did not report as income;
(2) the information from the IRS does not concern the 1992 and 1993 taxation years, but they are subject to a limited audit in the requirement that the Minister issued to the Caisse;
(3) from January 1994 to February 1995, the Minister's representatives met the applicant and his counsel to ask him to voluntarily provide the requested information, while at the same time trying to provide him with an audit plan that would be acceptable to him; and
(4) negotiations ceased in late February 1995.
2. Issues
[5]
The applicant raised two main issues, which can be summarized as follows:
(1) Did the Minister err in law by issuing a requirement dated September 23 to the Caisse to provide information and documents in that this requirement is invalid and unlawful:
♦ because it does not meet the criteria in s. 231.2 of the
Act
?
♦ because it is an abuse of power and indicates a lack of procedural fairness?
♦ because it is an unreasonable seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the
Charter
?
(2) Is the audit by the Minister unlawful because the applicant has not received an audit plan clearly indicating the period covered, the purpose, the relevance of the information requested and sufficient grounds?
3. General Principles
[6]
It is important to note the context in which the
Income Tax
is situated. Wilson, J., stated the following in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 385; 55 C.C.C.(3d) 530; 68 D.L.R.(4th) 568, at pp. 636-637 S.C.R.:
"A chief source of revenue for the federal government is the collection of income tax. The legislative scheme which has been put in place to regulate the collection of tax is the
Income Tax Act
. The
Act
requires taxpayers to file annual returns and estimate their tax payable as a result of calculations made in these returns. Moreover, the
Act
requires various third parties such as employers, corporations and banks to file information on wages, dividends, interest payments and the like. ... In essence, the system is a self-reporting and self-assessing one which depends upon the honesty and integrity of the taxpayers for its success. ... Nonetheless, it would be naive to think that no one attempts to take advantage of the self-reporting system in order to avoid paying his or her full share of the tax burden by violating the rules set forth in the
Act
."
[7]
Thus, in a context in which taxpayers are responsible for self-assessment, the Minister must have the power to carry out an in-depth audit where there is a valid reason to believe that a taxpayer's entire income was not reported. Tax liability must take into account the relevant information, including all of the taxpayer's income. Accordingly, if the taxpayer does not voluntarily provide all the relevant information, the Minister must obtain it by the other means set out in the
Act
.
4. The Facts
[8]
The correspondence in the case at bar is voluminous, but an overview of it is necessary to determine whether the applicant was sufficiently informed about the review of his file.
[9]
On May 17, 1994, the Assistant Deputy Minister of National Revenue, Taxation, wrote counsel for the applicant to inform him of the following:
[Translation] "... Pursuant to the exchange of information provisions in our tax convention with the United States, we have learned that Nick Djokich, a resident of Canada, received income from the American company Colorado Meat Packers Inc. in 1990 and 1991. The amounts in question, expressed in Canadian funds, are $120,954 in 1990 and $222,865 in 1991; Mr. Djokich reported a gross income of $57,200 and $57,950 for these two years respectively.
"Mr. Djokich's file is now being reviewed in detail. The information received from the American tax authorities seems to indicate that he failed to report a significant part of his income in 1990 and 1991. The purpose of the audit is to determine the exact amount of taxable income without regard to the origin of the money.
"Very few documents have been provided by Mr. Djokich so far to enable us to determine the volume of his sales in Canada, calculate his income and determine the exact nature of the sums received from Colorado Meat Packers Inc. ...
"A letter to Mr. Djokich from Patrick Décarie on March 24, 1994 does not contain any unusual requests. It seeks to obtain the information needed to determine Mr. Djokich's taxable income. In situations where the accounting records are inadequate or the income reported appears inconsistent with the taxpayer's standard of living, the auditor must prepare net worth statements (see para. 24 of I.C. 71-14R3). Accordingly, an audit of an unincorporated company usually involves a review of the bank records of the owner-operator, who often uses accounts interchangeably ..." (Affidavit of Michel Gionet, Exhibit C.)
[10]
On August 15, 1994, the same Assistant Deputy Minister wrote him again in the following terms:
[Translation] "... Sophal Men, the auditor responsible for the file, has already started receiving information from the United States tax authorities. He intends to contact Mr. Djokich very shortly to corroborate this information by examining bank records and personal balance sheets. The assessment proposal should be made very soon after this ..." (Affidavit of Michel Gionet, Exhibit F.)
[11]
On September 12, 1994, the Revenue Canada auditor wrote counsel for the applicant to make the following request:
[Translation] "Further to our telephone conversation today, we would like to ask you to provide us with your client's personal and business bank records for 1990 and 1991.
"A review of these documents is necessary to corroborate the information we have received ..." (Affidavit of Nick Djokich, Exhibit A-12.)
[12]
On September 14, 1994, counsel for the applicant answered the auditor as follows:
[Translation] "... To avoid any misunderstanding, we have taken the liberty of preparing a model audit plan for you, which is enclosed herewith and which you can simply complete on the dotted lines.
"We thus want an
assessment proposal
or a
precise audit plan
. If we have not received either by September 16, 1994 at the latest, we will assume that no assessment will be made and that our client owes the Department nothing ..." (Affidavit of Michel Gionet, Exhibit H.)
[13]
The model plan enclosed with the letter was as follows:
"

[14]
On September 16, 1994, Revenue Canada's Regional Co-ordinator, Audits and Appeals, answered counsel for the applicant as follows:
[Translation] "... in short, the audit plan for Mr. Djokich's file is relatively simple. We wish to audit the income earned by Mr. Djokich in 1990 and 1991. There are many phases to an audit of this item and they normally include a rigorous review of all the documents and vouchers that serve to establish the total income earned by the person being audited, such as sales journals, accounts receivable ledgers, contracts, invoices, delivery slips, bank records, deposit slip duplicates and investment contracts. In situations where these records are inadequate, internal control is nonexistent and vouchers are not available, as with Mr. Djokich's file, we carry out the audit using indirect techniques such as obtaining information from third parties.
"The next audit phase planned by the St-Hubert District Office is to review the Mr. Djokich's business and personal bank statements for the years being audited. These statements will be used to reconcile the information received regarding transactions with Colorado Meat Packers Inc. and to determine whether there are other sources of income. This exercise is an integral part of the audit mandate, is legal and is no way resembles a 'fishing expedition'. Mr. Djokich's co-operation is being requested to explain and to provide supporting documents concerning the unexplained deposits where appropriate ..." (Affidavit of Gilles Nadon, Exhibit C-4.)
[15]
On November 1, 1994, the Deputy Minister of National Revenue gave counsel for the applicant the following explanation:
[Translation] "... Moreover, I would like to point out that the information we obtained indicates that the sums received by Mr. Djokich from the American company Colorado Meat Packers Inc. represent income items that your client failed to include in his tax return for the 1990 and 1991 taxation years.
"Our tax system is based on self-assessment and each taxpayer is responsible for completing an income tax return and ensuring that it contains all the information needed to determine the tax payable for the year in question. For such a system to be fair to everyone, audit and review procedures must exist. Thus, for the reasons mentioned above, it is essential that the Department complete the audit of your client's file. If your client does not co-operate, we will make judicious use of all powers conferred by the
Income Tax Act
to obtain the information we need to complete our audit ..." (Affidavit of Michel Gionet, Exhibit G.)
[16]
On September 12, 1994, the Director -- Taxation issued a "Requirement to Provide Information and Documents" in accordance with ss. 231.2(1)(a) and (b) of the
Income Tax Act
. This requirement was delivered to the Caisse on or about November 17, 1994. It required the Caisse to provide the following documents regarding Mr. Djokich and G & D within 30 days:
"(a) A statement setting out all entries in all accounts at your Branch, that are known to be or to have been operated or controlled by, for, or on behalf of the persons named above or any of them and all joint accounts in the names of any of those persons and another or others and all entries that are known to be or to have been related to the affairs of those persons or any of them, in all other accounts at your Branch including Casual, Manager's Sundry and similar accounts.
"(b) A statement setting out particulars of all transactions, including loans and discounts and collateral thereto, safety deposit box rentals, safekeeping and security dealings at your Branch with, to, for or on behalf of the persons named above or any of them either alone or with another or others, or any person or persons known to be or to have been acting on behalf of those persons or any of them.
"(c) All documents, including authorizations, powers of attorney, mail and telegraphic transfers, accounts, vouchers, letters, contracts, letters of credit and statements that are known to be or to have been related to the entries or transactions set out in the statements required under (a) and (b) above." (Affidavit of Sophal Men, Exhibit A.)
[17]
On November 29, 1994, following a request by the Caisse to extend the 30 day deadline, the auditor agreed to make it simpler for the Caisse to comply with the requirement. He stated the following:
[Translation] "1. The documents mentioned in paragraphs 1(a), (b) and (c) of the said requirement are not required for 1990 and 1991;
"2. for the other years, the detailed account statements of the above-mentioned persons will be acceptable for the time being." (Affidavit of Sophal Men, Exhibit C.)
[18]
On December 21, 1994, the applicant filed an application for judicial review by means of an originating motion with respect to the Minister's decision to issue a requirement to the Caisse.
[19]
On January 18, 1995, counsel for the Department of Justice confirmed a meeting set for January 20 with counsel for the applicant to prepare an audit plan to reassure the applicant. He explained his decision as follows:
[Translation] "... As we told you, such audit plans are normally prepared for large-scale audits and there is usually no need to do so for audit files as simple as your client's. However, since you are convinced that your client is entitled to such a plan, we are prepared to give in to this demand and provide him with what he requests from our client.
"Moreover, as we specified, such an audit plan is not a static or rigid document. Where such plans are used, it frequently happens that they must be changed as the audit progresses, and we want to be certain that you do not see the said plan as being 'set in stone'.
"Of course, since we must apply working documents designed for large-scale files to a file that is relatively limited in scope, we must, along with you, adapt them to the circumstances of this file.
"In practical terms, we hope that it will be possible to find common ground that will enable our client to do the work that is required by the
Income Tax Act
with your client's full co-operation. We can assure you that, if we can work together rather than against each other, this file can be dealt with very quickly ..." (Affidavit of Patrick Jetté, Exhibit A.)
[20]
On January 23, 1995, the same counsel confirmed the following after a meeting with the applicant and his counsel:
"Pursuant to today's meeting with your client, Mr. Gionet and myself, we wish to confirm the following:
"The audit plan will be as follows:
a) The item to be audited is the income of Mr. Djokich and/or G & D Foods for the years 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993;
b) The objective of the audit is to ensure that Mr. Djokich and/or G & D Foods declared all their revenues for the above-mentioned years.
"Should the above be satisfactory, please ask your client to sign and return the present letter to the undersigned at your earliest convenience. Furthermore, could you please contact the undersigned in order to discuss the outcome of your proceedings.
"As discussed during our meeting, it is understood that the preparation of an audit plan is not a standard procedure since the present file does not qualify as an important audit. Accordingly, the present audit plan cannot be construed as being a precedent." (Affidavit of Patrick Jetté, Exhibit B.)
[21]
On February 9, counsel for the Department of Justice gave the applicant the following plan:

[23]

[24]
He then asked counsel for the applicant to agree mutually on a date to obtain information from the Caisse.
[25]
On February 20, 1995, counsel for the applicant answered that his client would provide deposit slips for 1990 and 1991 only and not for 1992 and 1993. He added: [Translation] "There is obviously no question of going to the bank with Sophal Men. (The Revenue Canada auditor.) Your client will therefore have to trust him". (Affidavit of Patrick Jetté, Exhibit H.)
[26]
On February 23, 1995, counsel for the Department of Justice expressed surprise at this response and at his client's about-face. (Affidavit of Patrick Jetté, Exhibit I.)
[27]
The discussions ended at that time. (Different counsel appeared before this court.)
5. The Requirement
(1) Income Tax Act Criteria
[28]
The applicant argued that the requirement should be quashed. It should be noted that s. 231.2(1) of the
Income Tax Act
allows such a requirement to be issued "for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of this Act". This section reads as follows:
"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, subject to subsection (2), for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of this Act, by notice served personally or by registered or certified mail, require that any person provide, within such reasonable time as is stipulated in the notice,
(a) any information or additional information, including a return of income or a supplementary return; or
(b) any document."
[29]
It must therefore be decided whether the requirement was issued for a purpose specified in the
Income Tax Act
. In my opinion, the
Act
clearly makes the Minister responsible for determining taxpayers' tax liability.
[30]
The circumstances in which such a requirement can be issued were described by the Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 622-623 S.C.R., Wilson, J., for the court, stated the following:
"The language of s. 231(3) [now 231.2(1)] of the
Income Tax Act
is unquestionably very broad and on its face would cover any demand for information made to anyone having knowledge of someone else's affairs relevant to that other person's tax liability. It would, in other words, if construed broadly, authorize an exploratory sortie into any taxpayer's affairs and require anyone having anything to contribute to the exploration to participate. It would not be necessary for the Minister to suspect noncompliance with the
Act
, let alone to have reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the
Act
was being violated as required in s. 231(4). Provided the information sought had a bearing (or perhaps even could conceivably have a bearing) on a taxpayer's tax liability it could be called for under the subsection.
"The
Canadian Bank of Commerce
case, however, makes it clear that the subsection is not to be construed that broadly. It establishes through the majority judgment written by Mr. Justice Cartwright (as he then was), that:
(a) the test of whether the Minister is acting for a purpose specified in the
Act
is an objective one and has to be decided on the proper interpretation of the subsection and its application to the circumstances disclosed;
(b) the obtaining of information relevant to the tax liability of some specific person or persons whose liability to tax is under investigation is a purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the
Act
;
(c) it is not necessary that the person from whom the information is sought be one whose liability to tax is under investigation;
(d) the fact that the giving of the information may disclose private transactions involving persons who are not under investigation and may not be liable to tax does not invalidate the requirement."
[31]
In the case at bar, the Minister received information indicating that Mr. Djokich had not reported all his income for 1990 and 1991. In these circumstances, it can be concluded objectively that the Minister acted for a purpose specified in the
Act
by seeking to determine the exact amount of taxable income deriving from all sources. The Minister has also shown that this information related to Mr. Djokich's tax liability. In view of Mr. Djokich's refusal after several meetings and communications to submit the vouchers needed for this purpose himself, a fair interpretation of the subsection allows the Minister to require the information from a third party. According to paragraph (b) above, the determination of his tax liability is a purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the
Act
. Finally, paragraph (d) was not raised in this court. I am therefore of the opinion that the instant case meets the requirements set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> for the application of the Minister's power to require information.
[32]
No information was obtained from the IRS regarding 1992 and 1993. However, according to paragraph (a) above, the purpose of this investigation must be determined in light of the relevant circumstances. The fact that the applicant did not report all his income for 1990 and 1991 must be taken into account. In my view, it was reasonable to conduct a preliminary review for 1992 and 1993 as part of the same audit. Since it was only a preliminary review, the Minister limited the requirement to the applicant's bank records for these two years. (Affidavit of Gilles Nadon, Exhibit C-4.) In these circumstances, I am also of the opinion that the Minister acted in accordance with a purpose specified in the
Act
by issuing a more limited requirement of 1992 and 1993.
[33]
For these reasons, I feel that the requirement was not an abuse of power by the Minister. The criteria set out in the
Income Tax Act
and the case law have been complied with and the Minister had the power to act as he did. No improper purpose was being pursued by the Minister. The Minister has the power and the right to consult all helpful and necessary documents to determine the applicant's taxable income for the years being audited. This information may reveal elements that will serve to make an assessment and, once this is done, the taxpayer may avail himself of all the remedies set out in the
Act
to dispute the assessment. Therefore, I find that the Minister's requirement is valid and well-founded under administrative law.
(2) The Issue Of Unreasonable Seizure
Under The Charter
[34]
The applicant submitted that the Minister's requirement constitutes an unreasonable seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the
Charter
. In
McKinlay Transport
, at 649-650 S.C.R., a majority of the Supreme Court found that s. 231(3), now 231.2(1), did constitute a "seizure". The court noted that the meaning to be given to "unreasonable" would be less strict in the administrative and regulatory context of the
Income Tax Act
. In my view, whether it is called an investigation or an audit, the procedure in the case at bar was conducted in the administrative context in question. In such a context, Wilson, J., stated the following about demands for information:
"In my opinion s. 231(3) [now 231.2(1)] provides the least intrusive means by which effective monitoring of compliance with the
Income Tax Act
can be effected. It involves no invasion of a taxpayer's home or business premises. It simply calls for the production of records which may be relevant to the filing of an income tax return. A taxpayer's privacy interest with regard to these documents ... is protected as much as possible since s. 241 of the
Act
protects the taxpayer from disclosure of his records or the information contained herein to other persons or agencies."
[35]
In the case at bar, the Minister tried numerous times to obtain the information and documents from the applicant. In light of the above evidence, it is clear that the applicant refused or was unable to provide the documents needed for the audit. It was thus reasonable for the Minister to use the next least intrusive method, namely a requirement for information from third parties. As Wilson, J., explained, the applicant's home and business premises were not invaded and his privacy interest is still protected under s. 241, which protects the confidentiality of information obtained.
[36]
For these reasons, I find that the requirement contemplated by s. 231.2(1) of the
Income Tax Act
is reasonable and does not violate the
Charter
.
6. The Audit Plan
[37]
In considering the application for a writ of mandamus to compel the Minister to provide the applicant with an audit plan, it is important to take account of the comments made by the Federal Court of Appeal with respect to this type of remedy in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at 766-769, Robertson, J.A., listed the principles that emerge from the case law on this matter.
[38]
First, there must clearly be a public legal duty to act, and this duty must be owed to the applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 766-767 F.C.) In the case at bar, the applicant alleged that Revenue Canada's
Taxation Operations Manual
(The applicant is referring to Chapter 14(47)), imposes a legal duty on the Minister to provide an audit plan. He claimed that this was supported by the doctrine of legitimate expectations. In my view, the
Manual
is merely a guide for junin audit officers. This document cannot create a public duty to act. Even if I were of the view that the
Manual
gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the Minister would provide an audit plan, it does not prescribe any precise form for such a plan. In the case at bar, the Minister on several occasions provided the applicant with audit plans that he hoped would satisfy him. He even tried twice to complete the forms that the applicant had designed himself. Consequently, although there was no legal duty to do so, the Minister provided the applicant with an audit plan that was sufficient under the circumstances.
[39]
Second, Robertson, J.A., stated some rules relating to the discretionary nature of the decision. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , pp. 767-768 F.C.) He clearly explained that "mandamus is unavailable to compel the exercise of a 'fettered discretion' in a particular way" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , p. 768 F.C.). Mandamus is used to compel the performance of a duty and not to limit the exercise of a discretion. In the instant case, I am of the view that the applicant is seeking to control the investigation by ensuring that the Minister is bound by certain results before all the information has been obtained and reviewed. The applicant is asking the court to assist him in this, which I refuse to do. The Minister's discretion is sufficiently limited by the
Act
; it should not be limited by the unreasonable requirements of a taxpayer seeking to establish his assessment before the investigation has been completed.
[40]
In light of the evidence in the record, the applicant cannot complain that he did not know what the Minister was seeking in his audit. The purpose of the audit and the documents requested was clear. There is therefore no reason to issue a writ of mandamus in the instant case.
7. Conclusions
[41]
For these reasons, the application to set aside the Minister's decision to issue the requirement is dismissed. In the case at bar, the requirement meets the criteria in s. 231.2 of the
Income Tax Act
, does not violate the applicant's rights under s. 8 of the
Charter
and is not an abuse of power. In addition, the application for a writ of mandamus to compel the Minister to provide a more detailed audit plan is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
