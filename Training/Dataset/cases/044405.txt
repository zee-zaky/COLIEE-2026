Introduction
[1]
Kane, J.
: This proceeding is an application for judicial review of the negative decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [the Board] made on February 21, 2012, wherein the Board determined that the applicants were not Convention Refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, [
IRPA
, the Act] nor persons in need of protection pursuant to Section 97 of the Act.
[2]
The applicants seek an Order that the Board's decision be set aside and the matter be referred back to a differently constituted panel for a re-determination of the applicants' refugee claim.
1. Factual Background
[3]
The applicants, Lamer Khan, his wife, Bibi Khan and two sons, Amir Khan and Saeed Khan, entered Canada on December 27, 2012 and claimed refugee protection from Afghanistan based on fear of persecution from the Taliban.
[4]
The principal applicant, Lamer Khan, is an Afghan citizen who fled that country around 1980 to Pakistan. In Pakistan he married Bibi Khan, also from Afghanistan. In 1988, the principal applicant relocated to the United Arab Emirates [UAE] with a work visa and a fraudulent Pakistani passport. His wife and children joined him a few years later, also with fraudulent Pakistani passports. The fraudulent passports were subsequently renewed over the years because the family's information had been entered in the citizenship database in Pakistan. Several more children were born while the family resided in the UAE. As children of Afghan citizens, they are all Afghan citizens, although they obtained Pakistani passports. There are now 11 children in the family. Only two of the children accompanied their father and mother to Canada. The principal applicant indicated that he had sought visas for all family members but only four were issued. The remaining children, ranging in age from approximately 10 to 25, are in the UAE. One of the older sons is married and has three children of his own and is working in the UAE.
[5]
The principal applicant was notified in November 2010 that his work permit in the UAE would not be renewed due to his age. This would result in the family not being able to remain in the UAE. Faced with the prospect of returning to Pakistan or Afghanistan, the four family members, who are the current applicants, sought refugee protection in Canada. The applicants' intention or goal was to be granted refugee status or found to be persons in need of protection and to then seek permanent resident status and to ultimately bring the other family members to Canada.
[6]
The applicants used their Pakistani passports and the visas issued in the UAE to travel to Canada. At the first interview with immigration officials, however, they provided false names and indicated that they were smuggled into Canada and had no identification. They further indicated that they were originally from Afghanistan where they had a farm and that in around 2005 some of their children had been sent to Pakistan to be educated and that this resulted in threats from the Taliban to return the family to Afghanistan. Rather than do so, the family fled to Pakistan where they lived until making arrangements to come to Canada.
[7]
Upon further inquiries, immigration officers noted that a family of the same description, with different names, but with the same birthdates, had arrived in Toronto on December 27, 2012 with Pakistani passports and visas issued in the UAE. After the immigration officers questioned the applicants about this similarity, the applicants provided different information which forms the basis of their claim for refugee status. The account provided at the first interview on January 6, 2011 and at the second interview on January 11, 2011 is recorded in detail in the Point of Entry [POE] notes.
[8]
The information provided by the applicants, set out in each original Personal Information Form [PIF] in February 2011 and in their amended PIF in December 2011, and which was fully considered by the Board, alleges that while in the UAE, around 1996, the principal applicant began to receive calls from the Taliban demanding money. Similar threats were communicated via the principal applicant's uncle who remained in Afghanistan, including a letter sent around 2008, (a scanned copy of which was provided), threatening that the family should return to Afghanistan and join the jihad or be beheaded.
[9]
The principal applicant had indicated in his first PIF that he began receiving threats from the Taliban in 1996. When further questioned about the dates he began to receive the threats, he indicated that in 1996 he did not receive threats directly, but was told from other people that the Taliban knew where he was and did not want him to educate his children. At the hearing before the Board, he indicated that in around 2006 he began receiving direct demands for financial support from the Taliban and death threats to the family, claiming the daughters should be burned because they were educated and the sons were American agents because they could speak English.
[10]
The applicants did not advise authorities in the UAE of these threats, offering the explanation that they continued to feel safe as long as they could remain in the UAE and that they did not wish to draw attention to the fact that they were in the UAE with fraudulent Pakistani passports.
[11]
Although the principal applicant had travelled to the United Kingdom in 2003 and to Canada in 2006, he offered the explanation that he did not claim refugee protection at that time because he had status in the UAE and he held the hope that the Taliban would be defeated in Afghanistan and he could eventually return there safely.
2. The Decision Under Review
[12]
The Board found that the claimants are not Convention refugees under Section 96 as they do not have a well founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan on any of the five Convention grounds. The Panel also found that the claimants are not persons in need of protection under Section 97 as, on a balance of probabilities, their removal to Afghanistan would not subject them personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.
[13]
In summary, the Board found that the claimants were not credible and, as a result, there was insufficient credible evidence to support their claim for refugee protection. The Board clearly stated that it found the claimants untruthful when they alleged that they were threatened by the Taliban in the UAE.
[14]
The Board also assessed whether the applicants were persons in need of protection pursuant to Section 97 and did so without regard to the credibility findings which resulted in the Board's negative determination pursuant to Section 96 of the Act. The Board considered whether the profiles of the applicants would subject them to harm in Afghanistan. The Panel found that there was "not even a serious possibility that such would be the case".
[15]
The Board noted that they regretted that the negative finding meant that the applicants' other family members could not join them in Canada, although, as Afghan citizens, the four applicants would be able to stay in Canada indefinitely since removal is suspended for that country. The Board indicated that if it had humanitarian and compassionate jurisdiction, it would no doubt have exercised that discretion but, in the words of the Board, "its hands are tied".
[16]
It should also be noted that the Board made findings with respect to the citizenship of the applicants which the applicants submitted were illogical. The Board found that the applicants were citizens of Afghanistan by birth and that since coming to Canada had been issued new Afghan passports. However, the Board also noted that, based on the information included in the citizenship database of Pakistan, the applicants were citizens of Pakistan. While such comments appear inconsistent, and the Board clearly acknowledged that the applicants disagreed with this finding, it clearly stated that the claims had been decided on the basis of whether the claimants would be at risk in Afghanistan. The findings with respect to citizenship had no bearing on the Board's assessment of the claim with respect to Section 96 or 97.
3. Standard of Review
[17]
The Supreme Court of Canada, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para. 57, held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Where the standard of review applicable to the particular question before the court is well settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review.
[18]
The jurisprudence post- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> confirms that the appropriate standard of review applicable to credibility and plausibility assessments is that of reasonableness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 13;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 17-20;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 17-20),
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 13-14 [
Lin
].
[19]
The Board's analysis of credibility and plausibility is central to its role as trier of fact and that the Board's findings should be given significant deference:
Lin
at para. 13.
[20]
As noted by O'Keefe J. in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 65 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], " It is well established that credibility findings demand a high level of judicial deference and should only be overturned in the clearest of cases
(see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1633 at paragraph 30). As such, the Court should generally not substitute its opinion unless it finds that the decision was based on erroneous findings of fact made in either a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it (
see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] FCJ No 1869 at paragraph 3)."
[21]
The role of the court in judicial review where the standard of reasonableness applies is not to substitute any decision it would have made but, rather, to determine whether the decision of the Board "falls within 'a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law' (Dunsmuir at para. 47). There might be more than one reasonable outcome. However, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome.":
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Analysis
[22]
The applicants submitted that the credibility findings were not reasonable in that the Board placed too much emphasis on the initial lie which then influenced its determinations of credibility with respect to all other matters.
[23]
The applicants submitted that their explanations for the amendments to the PIF were not inconsistencies, rather additional information, and that the Board misapprehended the responses with respect to the letter sent by the Taliban to the principal applicant's uncle allegedly in 2008. Although the uncle indicated he received the letter in 2008, the applicants were not necessarily aware of it in 2008 and therefore any inferences drawn by the Board about why this letter was not mentioned in the amended PIF are not appropriate and should not impact on credibility.
[24]
The applicants submitted that the Board unreasonably chose to accept some of the information provided while rejecting other information as not credible. They submitted that, where credibility is an issue, the Board has a basic obligation to make a clear and unmistakable finding that the claimant is or is not credible and give real reasons for its finding. The applicants further submitted that doubts about the credibility of some or all of the applicants' testimony do not relieve the Board from the responsibility of determining, based on all the evidence, whether the applicants are refugees.
[25]
With respect to the Section 97 claim, the principal applicant emphasised that he claimed that his family would be at risk if returned to Afghanistan, not that he would be at personal risk, and that the family would indeed be a displaced family, given that the children had never lived in Afghanistan, and could be singled out because they had been well educated (including the daughters) and spoke English.
[26]
The applicants also submitted that the Board's finding that they were not persons in need of protection was illogical given the Board's observation that the applicants would not likely be removed from Canada to Afghanistan due to overall risk.
[27]
The respondent submitted that the decision of the Board was reasonable. The Board had the full opportunity to assess the quality of the evidence and the credibility of the applicants in the written material and at the oral hearing and concluded, based on several factors, that the applicants were not credible.
[28]
The respondent noted that the Board outlined its credibility findings in clear and unmistakable terms and provided many examples of where it found that the applicants were not credible, including the fraudulently obtained Pakistani passports, the change in the timeframe with respect to the undocumented threatening calls from the Taliban from 1996 to 2006, the changing justifications for not making refugee claims during the past trips to the United Kingdom and Canada in 2003 and 2006 respectively, the failure to report the alleged threats to the UAE government even though this government was itself opposed to the Taliban, the late mention and production of an unverifiable copy of an alleged threatening letter from the Taliban received by an uncle in Pakistan around 2008, and the failure to mention allegations relating to the education of the daughters in the original and amended PIF.
[29]
Based on the totality of evidence, the respondent submitted that it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the applicants had not met the burden of providing credible evidence to support their claim for refugee protection- i.e. that they had been threatened by the Taliban - or providing a reasonable explanation for the absence of such documents.
[30]
With respect to the Section 97 claim, the respondent submitted that the Board put aside the credibility issues and objectively assessed whether the applicants were persons in need of protection and reasonably concluded they were not.
[31]
In my view, the Board made clear and unmistakable findings with respect to the credibility of the applicants.
[32]
With respect to the amendments made to the PIF, the jurisprudence has established that a Board may draw negative credibility inferences where important events or information is omitted and revealed only later and a reasonable explanation is not provided for their earlier inclusion: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 69;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] FCJ No 1112 at para 18; and,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1615 at para 18.
[33]
In this case the Board found that the explanations for the principal applicant's failure to indicate why he did not make a refugee claim in 2003 or 2006, the inconsistencies in the dates and the nature of the threats, and his very late mention of the threats by the Taliban directed toward his children, which he only raised at the oral hearing, were not satisfactory. The Board also found that the explanation offered by the principal applicant about why he provided a completely fabricated and "systemic lie" upon entering Canada given his stated desperation to flee to Canada to secure freedom and protection for his family to be "markedly unsatisfactory". The principal applicant had indicated that he was advised by persons in the UAE to provide the false story.
[34]
The Board is entitled to take into account omissions, differences and inconsistencies in the PIFs, Point of Entry [POE] notes and the oral testimony and to draw negative credibility findings: (
Lin
at para. 17).
[35]
This Court has stated on several occasions that over reliance on POE notes in considering a claimant's credibility may constitute a reviewable error:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 51;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 16. The POE notes are not intended to contain all the details of the claim. In this case, the Board relied on all the evidence, including the POE notes, which set out the first account by the applicants and which the board found to be totally fabricated. While the Board did not base its determination on the POE notes, the information provided was a consideration for the Board in assessing credibility which the Board fully acknowledged.
[36]
With respect to the Section 97 claim, adverse credibility findings, which may be determinative of a claim pursuant to Section 96, are not necessarily conclusive of the Section 97 claim. The assessment under Section 97 requires the Board to consider objectively whether the applicants' removal would subject them personally to a risk to their life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 26).
[37]
The Board engaged in a separate and objective assessment of the Section 97 claim, without regard to the credibility concerns, and came to its conclusion based on the information considered that there was not even a reasonable possibility that the applicants, given their profile, would face a risk of harm from the Taliban if hypothetically returned to Afghanistan more than any other Afghans would face.
5. Conclusion
[38]
As noted above, credibility findings of the Board are to be given a high degree of deference. It is not the role of the Court to substitute its view of the outcome.
[39]
The decision of the Board is reasonable in that it falls within "a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law: Dunsmuir at para. 47. The decision reached with respect to the Section 96 claim was based on credibility findings which were justified, transparent and intelligible.
[40]
The Board made significant findings with respect to credibility which were set out in the clearest of terms. The Board noted that the various inconsistencies and omissions on their own may not have led to a finding that the principal applicant was not credible, but the fact that he had told a "totally fabricated" version of his story upon first arriving in Canada "was one huge lie which made such a finding not difficult." The applicant "chose to make his first significant act in Canada a systematic lie to the Government of Canada" and his explanation that he had been advised to do so to improve his chances of remaining in Canada and bringing his remaining family to Canada was "markedly unsatisfactory".
[41]
The Board noted that "because the claimant lied about so many things, the Panel cannot accept that he is telling the truth about the critical issue, that is, whether he was being threatened by the Taliban in the UAE as he said. He had very little persuasive corroborative evidence to back up his claims, but there were many credibility concerns which served to give reason to doubt his claims. Thus
,
the Panel simply does not believe the claimant was threatened as alleged."
[42]
With respect to the Section 97 claim, the Board assessed this objectively, without regard to the credibility concerns, and concluded that there was not even a reasonable possibility that the applicants, given their profile, would face a risk of harm from the Taliban if they were returned to Afghanistan, more than the risk of harm faced by other Afghans.
[43]
While Counsel for the applicant suggested that such a finding is illogical given the Board's observation that the applicants would not likely be removed to Afghanistan due to overall risk, the Board's role was to determine the Section 97 claim, which it did, based on all the information considered.
[44]
The Board noted that the documentation reviewed did not indicate that an ability on the part of the son to speak English would subject him or the family to persecution by the Taliban. The Board noted that the family would not be perceived as aligned with the West given that they had lived in the UAE, which was an Islamic country. Nor would they be perceived as wealthy, despite having lived in the UAE, because the evidence was that the principal applicant was a truck driver with a modest income and a large family to support.
[45]
The Board found that it was hypothetically possible that the Taliban could target anyone in Afghanistan, but that no persuasive evidence had been adduced that would show the applicant to be more of a hypothetical target than any other Afghan. The applicant had not expressed any public opposition to the Taliban. The Board found that he had not been threatened by the Taliban for refusing to support them while in the UAE and therefore that the Taliban would not likely remember his refusal and exact reprisals. While it was hypothetically possible that his sons could be forced into Madrasas (Islamic schools) or his daughters could be barred from school, no evidence had been presented that this was occurring to all or even most Afghan families and there was no evidence that it was "even a reasonable possibility" for the applicant's family if they were to return to Afghanistan.
[46]
The Board's determination was based on the claim made by the principal applicant and his wife and two sons. However, the Board fully appreciated the impact of its negative decision on the whole family. The Board acknowledged that if the current applicants were not removed to Afghanistan, which the Board suggested would be the case regardless of its decision to deny the applicants' claim for refugee protection, the family would not be easily reunited and there would be an impact on the remaining children in the UAE. The Board clearly understood that its decision would impact all family members - those still in the UAE who were not applicants and the four current applicants. The Board indicated that it regretted the outcome and that it did not have humanitarian and compassionate discretion. It appears that the Board understood the sincere desire and motivation of the applicants to seek refugee status in Canada, but despite this understanding the Board could not ignore the several significant credibility concerns it had which resulted in its findings that there was no credible evidence to support their claim for refugee protection, nor could the Board find evidence to support that the applicants would face a risk to their life or of cruel or unusual punishment if returned to Afghanistan. The Board's findings demand a high level of deference and should only be overturned in the clearest of cases. This is not one of those cases. The Board's decision falls within a range of possible outcomes which are defensible in light of the facts and the law.
JUDGMENT
[47]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed; and
2. No serious question of general importance is certified.

Lamer Khan, Bibi Khamida, Saeed Lamir Khan, Amir  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Kane
[Traduction]: La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire vise une décision défavorable rendue par la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la Commission] le 21 février 2012. La Commission a alors déterminé que les demandeurs n'avaient ni la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention visée à l'article 96 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
[la LIPR ou la Loi], ni celle de personne à protéger visée à l'article 97 de la Loi.
[2]
Les demandeurs demandent à la Cour d'ordonner que cette décision soit annulée et que l'affaire soit renvoyée à un tribunal différemment constitué pour qu'une nouvelle décision soit rendue.
1. Le contexte factuel
[3]
Les demandeurs, Lamer Khan, son épouse, Bibi Khan, et deux fils, Amir Khan et Saeed Khan, sont entrés au Canada le 27 décembre 2010 et ont demandé l'asile parce qu'ils craignent d'être persécutés par les talibans en Afghanistan.
[4]
Le demandeur principal, Lamer Khan, est un citoyen afghan qui a fui son pays vers 1980 pour aller au Pakistan. C'est dans ce pays qu'il a épousé Bibi Khan, qui est également originaire de l'Afghanistan. En 1988, il a déménagé aux Émirats arabes unis [les Émirats], avec en main un visa de travail et un faux passeport pakistanais. Son épouse et ses enfants l'ont rejoint quelques années plus tard, grâce aussi à des faux passeports pakistanais. Ces passeports ont ensuite été renouvelés au fil des ans parce que les renseignements sur la famille se trouvaient dans la base de citoyenneté au Pakistan. Plusieurs enfants sont nés pendant que la famille vivait aux Émirats. Comme les parents sont des citoyens afghans, tous les enfants le sont également, bien qu'ils aient obtenu des passeports pakistanais. La famille compte maintenant 11 enfants. Seuls deux d'entre eux ont accompagné leurs parents au Canada. Le demandeur principal a indiqué qu'il avait demandé des visas pour tous les membres de la famille, mais que seulement quatre avaient été délivrés. Les autres enfants, dont l'âge varie de 10 à 25 ans, sont tous aux Émirats. L'un des fils aînés est marié, a trois enfants et travaille aux Émirats.
[5]
Le demandeur principal a été avisé en novembre 2010 que son permis de travail aux Émirats ne serait pas renouvelé à cause de son âge, de sorte que la famille ne pourrait pas demeurer dans ce pays. Confrontés au risque de devoir retourner au Pakistan ou en Afghanistan, les demandeurs ont demandé l'asile au Canada. Ils prévoyaient se voir reconnaître la qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger, puis demander le statut de résident permanent et faire venir les autres membres de la famille au Canada.
[6]
Les demandeurs ont utilisé leurs passeports pakistanais et les visas délivrés aux Émirats pour venir au Canada. Cependant, lors de leur première entrevue avec les agents d'immigration, ils ont donné de faux noms et ont indiqué qu'un passeur les avait aidés à venir au Canada et qu'ils n'avaient pas de pièces d'identité. Ils ont indiqué également qu'ils étaient originaires de l'Afghanistan, où ils possédaient une ferme, que certains de leurs enfants avaient été envoyés au Pakistan pour étudier vers 2005 et que, en conséquence, les talibans avaient menacé la famille de la renvoyer en Afghanistan. La famille s'est plutôt enfuie au Pakistan, où elle est restée jusqu'à ce qu'elle fasse des démarches pour venir au Canada.
[7]
Après avoir fait enquête, les agents d'immigration ont constaté qu'une famille similaire, avec des dates de naissance identiques, mais des noms différents, était arrivée à Toronto le 27 décembre 2010 avec en main des passeports pakistanais et des visas délivrés dans les Émirats. Après avoir été interrogés à ce sujet par les agents d'immigration, les demandeurs ont fourni des renseignements différents sur lesquels est fondée leur demande d'asile. Le récit fait lors de la première entrevue le 6 janvier 2011 et lors de la deuxième entrevue le 11 janvier 2011 est relaté de manière détaillée dans les notes prises au point d'entrée [PDE].
[8]
Dans les renseignements fournis par les demandeurs, qui figurent dans chaque Formulaire de renseignements personnels [FRP] original daté de février 2011 et dans les FRP modifiés en décembre 2011 et qui ont été pris en compte de manière exhaustive par la Commission, il est allégué que le demandeur principal a commencé à recevoir des appels des talibans qui lui réclamaient de l'argent vers 1996, alors qu'il vivait aux Émirats. Son oncle, resté en Afghanistan, l'a informé de menaces semblables qu'il aurait reçues, notamment dans une lettre envoyée vers 2008 (dont une copie numérisée a été produite), où il était indiqué que la famille devait retourner en Afghanistan et se joindre au jihad, sinon ses membres seraient décapités.
[9]
Le demandeur principal avait écrit dans son premier FRP qu'il avait commencé à recevoir des menaces des talibans en 1996. Lorsqu'il a été interrogé au sujet de la date à laquelle les menaces avaient commencé, il a indiqué qu'il n'avait pas reçu de menaces directement en 1996, mais que d'autres personnes lui avaient dit que les talibans savaient où il se trouvait et qu'ils ne voulaient pas qu'il fasse instruire ses enfants. À l'audience devant la Commission, il a indiqué qu'il avait commencé à recevoir des demandes directes d'argent des talibans et des menaces de mort visant sa famille vers 2006. Selon ces menaces, ses filles devaient être brûlées parce qu'elles allaient à l'école et ses fils étaient des agents américains parce qu'ils parlaient anglais.
[10]
Les demandeurs n'ont pas informé les autorités des Émirats de ces menaces parce que, ont-ils dit, ils se sentaient toujours en sécurité dans ce pays et ils ne voulaient pas attirer l'attention sur le fait qu'ils détenaient de faux passeports pakistanais.
[11]
Le demandeur principal a expliqué qu'il n'avait pas demandé l'asile lorsqu'il s'était rendu au Royaume-Uni en 2003 et au Canada en 2006 parce qu'il avait un statut aux Émirats et qu'il espérait que les talibans seraient défaits en Afghanistan et qu'il pourrait un jour retourner dans ce pays en tout sécurité.
2. La décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle
[12]
La Commission a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention visée à l'article 96 car ils ne craignaient pas avec raison d'être persécutés en Afghanistan pour l'un des cinq motifs prévus par la Convention. Elle a conclu également qu'ils n'avaient pas la qualité de personne à protéger visée à l'article 97 car, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, leur renvoi en Afghanistan ne les exposerait pas personnellement à une menace à leur vie, au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités ou au risque d'être soumis à la torture.
[13]
En résumé, la Commission a conclu que les demandeurs n'étaient pas crédibles et que leur demande d'asile n'était pas étayée par une preuve crédible. Elle a affirmé clairement qu'ils mentaient lorsqu'ils alléguaient avoir été menacés par les talibans aux Émirats.
[14]
La Commission a examiné la question de savoir si les demandeurs avaient la qualité de personne à protéger visée à l'article 97, sans tenir compte des conclusions relatives à la crédibilité qui avaient mené à sa décision défavorable concernant l'article 96 de la Loi. Elle s'est demandé si, à cause de leur profil, les demandeurs seraient susceptibles de subir un préjudice en Afghanistan. Elle a conclu qu'il n'existait « même pas une possibilité sérieuse que tel soit le cas ».
[15]
La Commission a souligné qu'elle regrettait que la conclusion défavorable fasse en sorte que les autres membres de la famille des demandeurs ne puissent pas les rejoindre au Canada, mais, en tant que citoyens afghans, les quatre demandeurs pourraient demeurer au Canada indéfiniment puisque les renvois en Afghanistan étaient suspendus. Elle a indiqué que, si elle avait eu compétence pour examiner des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, elle l'aurait assurément exercée, mais, pour reprendre ses termes, elle « a les mains liées ».
[16]
Il faut noter également que la Commission a tiré des conclusions relativement à la citoyenneté des demandeurs que ces derniers jugent illogiques. La Commission a indiqué que les demandeurs étaient des citoyens afghans de naissance et que de nouveaux passeports afghans leur avaient été délivrés depuis leur arrivée au Canada. Elle a toutefois ajouté que, selon l'information contenue dans la base de citoyenneté du Pakistan, ils étaient des citoyens de ce pays. Bien que ces remarques semblent contradictoires, la Commission a mentionné clairement - en reconnaissant que les demandeurs n'étaient pas d'accord avec elle - que la décision relative aux demandes d'asile était fondée sur la question de savoir si les demandeurs seraient en danger en Afghanistan. Les conclusions relatives à la citoyenneté n'ont eu aucune incidence sur l'appréciation que la Commission a faite de la demande d'asile sous le régime des articles 96 et 97.
3. La norme de contrôle
[17]
La Cour suprême du Canada a décidé, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 57, que l'analyse de la norme de contrôle n'a pas besoin d'être effectuée dans tous les cas. Lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à la question particulière soumise à la cour a déjà été établie par les tribunaux, la cour de révision peut l'adopter.
[18]
Les décisions rendues après <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> confirment que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique aux conclusions relatives à la crédibilité et à la vraisemblance est celle de la raisonnabilité:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 20;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 20);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 14 [
Lin
].
[19]
L'analyse de la crédibilité et de la vraisemblance par la Commission est un élément essentiel de son rôle de juge des faits et ses conclusions en la matière devraient bénéficier d'une retenue appréciable:
Lin
, au paragraphe 13.
[20]
Comme le juge O'Keefe l'a souligné dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], « [i] l est bien établi que les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité commandent un degré élevé de déférence judiciaire et qu'elles ne doivent être infirmées que dans les cas les plus évidents (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1633, au paragraphe 30). Cela étant, la Cour ne doit généralement pas substituer son opinion à celle du décideur, à moins qu'elle conclue que la décision a été fondée sur des conclusions de fait erronées, tirées de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle disposait (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] ACF no1869, au paragraphe 3) ».
[21]
Lorsque la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique, le rôle de la Cour ne consiste pas à substituer la décision qu'elle aurait prise à celle faisant l'objet du contrôle judiciaire, mais plutôt à déterminer si la décision « fait partie des "issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par. 47). Il peut exister plus d'une issue raisonnable. Néanmoins, si le processus et l'issue en cause cadrent bien avec les principes de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité, la cour de révision ne peut y substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable »:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . L'analyse
[22]
Les demandeurs soutenaient que les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité n'étaient pas raisonnables parce que la Commission avait accordé une trop grande importance au mensonge fait à leur arrivée au Canada, lequel a ensuite influé sur son appréciation de la crédibilité au regard de toutes les autres questions.
[23]
Les demandeurs soutenaient que leurs explications concernant les modifications apportées aux FRP n'étaient pas incohérentes, mais qu'il s'agissait plutôt de renseignements additionnels. Ils soutenaient également que la Commission avait mal compris les réponses données à la lettre qui aurait été envoyée à l'oncle du demandeur principal par les talibans en 2008. L'oncle a indiqué qu'il avait reçu cette lettre en 2008, mais les demandeurs n'étaient pas nécessairement au courant de celle-ci en 2008. C'est pour cette raison que les conclusions tirées par la Commission relativement à l'omission de cette lettre dans les FRP modifiés ne sont pas appropriées et ne devraient pas avoir une incidence sur la question de la crédibilité.
[24]
Les demandeurs ont fait valoir que la Commission avait déraisonnablement choisi d'accepter certains des renseignements fournis, tout en en rejetant d'autres au motif qu'ils n'étaient pas crédibles. Ils soutenaient que, lorsque la crédibilité est en cause, la Commission a l'obligation fondamentale de conclure clairement et sans équivoque que le demandeur est ou n'est pas crédible et d'exposer les motifs réels de sa conclusion. Les demandeurs soutenaient également que le fait que la Commission avait des doutes au sujet de la crédibilité d'au moins certains de leurs témoignages ne la libérait pas de l'obligation de déterminer, en se fondant sur la preuve, s'ils étaient des réfugiés.
[25]
En ce qui concerne la demande fondée sur l'article 97, le demandeur principal a souligné qu'il soutenait que sa famille serait en danger si elle retournait en Afghanistan, non qu'il serait exposé à un risque personnel, et que sa famille serait une famille déplacée étant donné que les enfants n'avaient jamais vécu en Afghanistan et qu'ils pourraient être stigmatisés parce qu'ils sont instruits (même les filles) et parlent anglais.
[26]
Les demandeurs soutenaient également que la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle ils n'avaient pas la qualité de personne à protéger était illogique puisque la Commission a fait observer qu'ils ne seraient probablement pas renvoyés en Afghanistan en raison de risque général existant dans ce pays.
[27]
Le défendeur a fait valoir que la décision de la Commission était raisonnable. La Commission a eu la possibilité d'apprécier la qualité de la preuve et la crédibilité des demandeurs dans les documents écrits et à l'audience, et elle a conclu, en se fondant sur plusieurs facteurs, que les demandeurs n'étaient pas crédibles.
[28]
Le défendeur a souligné que la Commission avait exposé ses conclusions relatives à la crédibilité en termes clairs et sans équivoque et avait donné de nombreux exemples des aspects sur lesquels la preuve des demandeurs n'était pas crédible, notamment les faux passeports pakistanais, le fait qu'ils avaient dit que les appels de menaces des talibans remontaient à 1996, puis à 2006, le fait que le demandeur principal avait donné deux versions des raisons pour lesquelles il n'avait pas demandé l'asile lors de voyages au Royaume-Uni et au Canada en 2003 et en 2006 respectivement, le fait que les demandeurs n'avaient pas signalé au gouvernement des Émirats les menaces qu'ils auraient reçues même si ce gouvernement était lui-même opposé aux talibans, la mention et la production tardives d'une copie d'une lettre des talibans qu'un oncle au Pakistan aurait reçue vers 2008 et dont l'authenticité ne pouvait pas être vérifiée, et le défaut de faire état des allégations concernant l'instruction des filles dans les FRP originaux et les FRP modifiés.
[29]
S'appuyant sur l'ensemble de la preuve, le défendeur soutenait qu'il était raisonnable pour la Commission de conclure que les demandeurs ne s'étaient pas acquittés du fardeau de produire une preuve crédible à l'appui de leur demande d'asile - une preuve démontrant qu'ils avaient reçu des menaces de la part des talibans - ou une explication raisonnable de l'absence d'une telle preuve.
[30]
En ce qui concerne la demande fondée sur l'article 97, le défendeur soutenait que la Commission avait écarté les problèmes de crédibilité pour déterminer objectivement si les demandeurs avaient la qualité de personne à protéger. La Commission a raisonnablement conclu que ce n'était pas le cas.
[31]
À mon avis, la Commission a tiré des conclusions claires et sans équivoque quant à la crédibilité des demandeurs.
[32]
En ce qui concerne les modifications apportées aux FRP, la jurisprudence indique que la Commission peut tirer des conclusions défavorables relativement à la crédibilité quand des faits ou des renseignements importants qui avaient été omis sont révélés ultérieurement et que leur omission n'est pas expliquée de manière raisonnable: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 66;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] ACF no 1112, au paragraphe 18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1615, au paragraphe 18.
[33]
En l'espèce, la Commission n'a pas jugé satisfaisantes les raisons données par le demandeur principal pour expliquer pourquoi il n'avait pas demandé l'asile en 2003 ou en 2006, les incohérences concernant les dates et la nature des menaces et le fait qu'il avait mentionné très tardivement les menaces des talibans visant directement ses enfants - il en avait parlé seulement à l'audience. De plus, elle a jugé « nettement insatisfaisante » l'explication qu'il avait donnée au sujet des raisons pour lesquelles il avait « ment[i] systématiquement » et avait inventé une histoire à son arrivée au Canada parce qu'il tenait absolument à venir ici afin d'assurer la protection et la liberté de sa famille. Le demandeur principal avait indiqué que des personnes aux Émirats lui avaient conseillé de raconter une fausse histoire.
[34]
La Commission peut tenir compte des omissions, des divergences et des incohérences contenues dans les FRP, les notes prises au PDE et les témoignages et tirer des conclusions défavorables concernant la crédibilité:
Lin
, au paragraphe 17.
[35]
La Cour a affirmé à plusieurs reprises que le fait d'accorder une trop grande importance aux notes prises au PDE dans le cadre de l'appréciation de la crédibilité d'un demandeur peut constituer une erreur susceptible de contrôle:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Les notes prises au PDE ne devraient pas reprendre tous les détails de la demande d'asile. En l'espèce, la Commission s'est appuyée sur tous les éléments de preuve, dont les notes prises au PDE, qui relataient le premier récit qui a été fait par les demandeurs et que la Commission a jugé entièrement inventé. Bien que la Commission n'ait pas fondé sa décision sur ces notes, elle devait prendre en considération l'information fournie pour apprécier la crédibilité, ce qu'elle a fait.
[36]
Les conclusions défavorables relatives à la crédibilité peuvent être déterminantes dans le cas d'une demande fondée sur l'article 96, mais pas nécessairement en ce qui concerne une demande fondée sur l'article 97. Cette disposition exige que la Commission détermine objectivement si le renvoi des demandeurs les exposerait personnellement à une menace à leur vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[37]
La Commission a procédé à une appréciation distincte et objective de la demande fondée sur l'article 97, sans tenir compte des problèmes de crédibilité, et elle a conclu, sur la foi des renseignements dont elle disposait, qu'il n'existait même pas une possibilité raisonnable que, à cause de leur profil, les demandeurs risquent davantage que tout autre Afghan de subir un préjudice de la part des talibans s'ils sont renvoyés en Afghanistan.
5. Conclusion
[38]
Comme il a été mentionné précédemment, les conclusions de la Commission concernant la crédibilité doivent faire l'objet d'une grande retenue. Il n'appartient pas à la Cour de substituer son opinion à la décision de la Commission.
[39]
La décision de la Commission est raisonnable car elle fait partie des « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47. La décision rendue relativement à la demande fondée sur l'article 96 reposait sur des conclusions concernant la crédibilité qui étaient justifiées, transparentes et intelligibles.
[40]
La Commission a tiré, au sujet de la crédibilité, des conclusions importantes qui ont été énoncées de la façon la plus claire possible. Elle a mentionné qu'elle n'aurait peut-être pas conclu que le demandeur principal n'était pas crédible s'il n'y avait eu que les diverses incohérences et omissions, mais, comme le demandeur avait raconté une version« totalement inventée » de son histoire à son arrivée au Canada,« une telle conclusion n'a pas été difficile à prendre en raison d'un grand mensonge ». Le demandeur avait « choisi de poser son premier geste significatif au Canada en mentant systématiquement au gouvernement de ce pays » et son explication selon laquelle on lui avait conseillé de le faire afin d'augmenter ses chances de demeurer au Canada et d'y faire venir les autres membres de sa famille était « nettement insatisfaisante ».
[41]
La Commission a souligné que « parce que le demandeur d'asile a menti sur bien des choses, le tribunal ne peut pas accepter qu'il dise maintenant la vérité sur la question essentielle, qui consiste à déterminer s'il a bien été menacé par les talibans aux Émirats arabes unis, comme il l'a soutenu. Le demandeur d'asile avait très peu d'éléments de preuve corroborants prouvant ses affirmations, mais de nombreuses préoccupations quant à la crédibilité ont fait douter de ses affirmations. Par conséquent, le tribunal ne croit tout simplement pas que le demandeur d'asile a été menacé comme il l'a allégué. »
[42]
En ce qui concerne la demande fondée sur l'article 97, la Commission l'a appréciée objectivement, sans tenir compte des problèmes de crédibilité, et elle a conclu qu'il n'existait même pas une possibilité raisonnable que, à cause de leur profil, les demandeurs risquent davantage que les autres Afghans de subir un préjudice de la part des talibans s'ils sont renvoyés en Afghanistan.
[43]
Bien que l'avocate du demandeur ait laissé entendre qu'une telle conclusion est illogique puisque la Commission a dit que les demandeurs ne seraient probablement pas renvoyés en Afghanistan à cause du risque général existant dans ce pays, le rôle de la Commission consistait à statuer sur la demande fondée sur l'article 97, ce qu'elle a fait, en tenant compte de tous les renseignements dont elle disposait.
[44]
La Commission a souligné que les documents qu'elle avait examinés n'indiquaient pas que le fils risquait d'être persécuté par les talibans parce qu'il parlait anglais ou que la famille courait ce risque pour la même raison. Elle a mentionné que la famille ne serait pas perçue comme partageant les valeurs de l'Occident étant donné qu'elle avait vécu aux Émirats, un pays islamique. Elle ne serait pas perçue non plus comme étant riche, malgré le fait qu'elle avait vécu aux Émirats, parce que, selon la preuve, le demandeur principal était camionneur, gagnait un revenu modeste et avait une famille nombreuse à faire vivre.
[45]
La Commission a conclu qu'il était possible en théorie que les talibans s'en prennent à n'importe qui en Afghanistan, mais qu'aucune preuve convaincante démontrant que le demandeur constituait davantage une cible hypothétique que tout autre Afghan n'a été produite. Le demandeur n'avait pas exprimé publiquement son opposition aux talibans. Selon la Commission, il n'avait pas été menacé par les talibans après avoir refusé de les soutenir pendant qu'il vivait aux Émirats. Les talibans ne se rappelleraient probablement pas ce fait et n'exerceraient probablement pas de représailles. Il était possible en théorie que les fils du demandeur soient forcés de fréquenter une madrasa (école islamique) ou qu'il soit interdit à ses filles d'aller à l'école, mais la preuve ne démontrait pas que cela arrivait à toutes les familles afghanes, ni même à la plupart d'entre elles, et qu'il existait « même une possibilité raisonnable » que cela arrive à la famille du demandeur si elle retournait en Afghanistan.
[46]
La décision de la Commission était fondée sur la demande du demandeur principal, de son épouse et de deux fils. La Commission était cependant pleinement consciente de l'effet de sa décision défavorable sur toute la famille. Elle a reconnu que, si les demandeurs n'étaient pas renvoyés en Afghanistan -ce qui serait le cas selon elle, peu importait qu'elle rejette leur demande d'asile -la famille ne pourrait pas facilement être réunie et il y aurait une incidence sur les enfants restés aux Émirats. La Commission a bien compris que sa décision aurait des répercussions sur tous les membres de la famille, sur ceux demeurés aux Émirats comme sur les quatre demandeurs. Elle a indiqué qu'elle regrettait l'issue de l'affaire et qu'elle n'avait pas le pouvoir discrétionnaire de tenir compte de motifs d'ordre humanitaire. Il semble qu'elle a compris le désir sincère des demandeurs d'obtenir l'asile au Canada et leur motivation à cet égard, mais elle ne pouvait pas faire abstraction des différents problèmes importants de crédibilité qui l'ont amenée à conclure que la demande d'asile des demandeurs n'était pas étayée par une preuve crédible et qu'il n'avait pas été démontré qu'ils seraient exposés au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités s'ils retournaient en Afghanistan. Les conclusions de la Commission appellent une grande retenue et ne devraient être infirmées que dans les cas les plus évidents. Or, il ne s'agit pas d'un de ces cas en l'espèce. La décision de la Commission appartient aux issues possibles acceptables au regard des faits et du droit.
