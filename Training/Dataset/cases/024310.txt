Richard, J.
: The following are my Reasons for Order as delivered orally from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario on October 4, 1994 and as edited.
[2]
The applicant seeks leave to cross-examine Mr. David Lee on his affidavit on behalf of the respondent, which was served on June 1, 1994.
[3]
According to rule 704(6) of the
Federal Court Rules
there can be no cross-examination on affidavits without the leave of the court. The jurisprudence is clear that the onus is on the applicant for leave to cross-examine to show special circumstances why cross-examination is required. In determining whether to grant leave to cross-examine, the following principles apply:
1. Cross-examination should not be permitted in areas that are within the knowledge or capability of knowledge of the examining party;
2. Cross-examination under this rule should not become an examination for discovery;
3. Cross-examination might be permitted in areas of ambiguity; and finally
4. It might be permitted to establish bias of an expert affiant [see footnote 1].
[4]
As was stated by Mr. Justice Teitelbaum in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) at p. 299:
"This clearly indicates that special circumstances must be shown to the court by an applicant to warrant cross-examination of an affiant. Such cross-examinations cause delay. It is insufficient to simply state that an affidavit is ambiguous or confusing. This must be shown to the court before permission to cross-examine an affiant is allowed."
[5]
I am not satisfied, on the material before me, that the applicant has satisfied the requirements of rule 704(6) of the
Federal Court Rules
.
[6]
Accordingly, this application is dismissed, with costs.
Application dismissed.
