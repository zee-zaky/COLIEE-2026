Blais, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the
Act
), for judicial review of a decision of a visa officer, dated May 26, 2006, refusing the applicant's application for a permanent resident visa as a skilled worker.
[2]
For the following reasons, I am satisfied that this application for judicial review should be allowed.
BACKGROUND
[3]
Mr. Singh (the applicant) is a citizen of India whose occupation is that of Sikh priest.
[4]
The applicant first arrived in Canada on a visitor's visa on December 31, 2002. He was also issued a visitor's record allowing him to temporarily perform religious duties in Edmonton, Alberta, and requiring him to depart by June 30, 2005. On October 21, 2004, his application for a permanent resident visa as a skilled worker was received at the Immigration Regional Program Center in Buffalo, New York.
[5]
On May 26, 2006, his application was denied by Nora Egan (the visa officer), on the ground that he did not meet the requirements for immigration to Canada under the skilled worker class.
[6]
Skilled worker applicants are assessed under the criteria set out at subsection 76(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, S.O.R./2002-227 (the
Regulations
) and require a minimum of 67 points to qualify for immigration. The visa officer awarded the applicant 10 out of 10 points on the age factor, 20 out of 25 points for education and 21 out of 21 points for his experience. Only 8 points out of 24 were awarded for official language proficiency, and no points were awarded for either adaptability or arranged employment. With a total of 59 points, the applicant fell short of the required 67 points needed to satisfy the visa officer that he could become economically established in Canada.
ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION
[7]
In this application for judicial review, the following issues must be considered:
a) Should the applicant be permitted to introduce in these proceedings evidence not before the visa officer?
b) Did the visa officer make a reviewable error by denying the applicant's application for a permanent resident visa?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[8]
It is well established in law that the decision of a visa officer whether or not to grant a permanent resident visa is a discretionary decision based essentially on a factual assessment. As the Federal Court of Appeal held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 278 N.R. 172; 2001 FCA 312, at paragraph 12:
"An application to be admitted to Canada as an immigrant gives rise to a discretionary decision on the part of a visa officer, which is required to be made on the basis of specific statutory criteria. Where that statutory discretion has been exercised in good faith and in accordance with the principles of natural justice and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, courts should not interfere (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)."
[9]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 288 F.T.R. 282; 2006 FC 268, Justice Yves de Montigny recognized that patent unreasonableness was the proper standard to review a visa officer's decision on an application for a permanent resident visa under the skilled worker class. He noted at paragraph 15:
"[...] This Court has consistently held that the particular expertise of visa officers dictates a deferential approach when reviewing their decisions. There is no doubt in my mind that the assessment of an Applicant for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class is an exercise of discretion that should be given a high degree of deference. To the extent that this assessment has been done in good faith, in accordance with the principles of natural justice applicable, and without relying on irrelevant or extraneous considerations, the decision of the visa officer should be reviewed on the standard of patent unreasonableness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2003 FCT 251;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2003 FCT 312;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2004 FC 64;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 572 (QL)."
[10]
However, where concerns are raised over an alleged breach of procedural fairness, the proper standard of review is correctness. If this Court determines a breach of procedural fairness occurred, it must return the decision to the first instance decision-maker for a re-determination (
Canadian  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 38).
ANALYSIS
A) Should the applicant be permitted to introduce in these proceedings evidence not before the visa officer?
[11]
Before turning to the merit of the application, I must first address the applicant's attempt to introduce in these proceedings evidence not before the visa officer. More specifically, the applicant seeks to introduce as evidence an email reply allegedly received by a co-worker of the applicant, from the Ministerial Enquiries Division of Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
[12]
It is settled law that, barring exceptional circumstances, evidence that was not before the decision-maker is not admissible before the Court in a judicial review proceeding (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)). As Justice Gilles Létourneau held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 323 N.R. 195; 2004 FCA 186, at paragraph 11:
"Judicial review proceedings are limited in scope. They are not trial de novo proceedings whereby determination of new issues can be made on the basis of freshly adduced evidence. As Rothstein, J.A., said in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). This is the reason why, barring exceptional circumstances such as bias or jurisdictional questions, which may not appear on the record, the reviewing Court is bound by and limited to the record that was before the judge or the Board. Fairness to the parties and the court or tribunal under review dictates such a limitation."
[13]
The question therefore becomes whether there are exceptional circumstances in this case that would permit the introduction of this new evidence. After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the applicant should be allowed to submit this new evidence.
[14]
While the email in question was sent to a third party and does not include the original inquiry, nor refers to the applicant in any way, it discloses information that is highly relevant to this case, as it concerns the interpretation by Citizenship and Immigration Canada of a section of the
Regulations
, which is contrary to that of the visa officer.
[15]
More importantly, the fact that this evidence was not before the decision-maker may not be entirely relevant in this case. While it was the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate that he meets the requirements of the
Act
and the
Regulations
to be awarded a permanent resident visa, it was not the responsibility of the applicant to explain to the visa officer what those requirements entail. In other words, it was not the applicant's responsibility to pass along to the visa officer the reply from the Ministerial Enquiries Division stating that priests are exempt from the requirement to have their job offer validated by the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (now Human Resources and Social Development Canada or "HRSDC") and that they should still be granted points for arranged employment if they can show a properly prepared job offer. If that is indeed the proper interpretation of the
Regulations
, something that I will consider in the next section, then the applicant was entitled to assume that the visa officer would know it and to feel confident that there was no need to submit this email in support of his application.
B) Did the visa officer make a reviewable error by denying the applicant's application for a permanent resident visa?
[16]
Turning now to the substance of the visa officer's decision, the applicant submits that the visa officer failed to properly interpret the
Act
and the
Regulations
in awarding 0 points for arranged employment and 0 points for adaptability. The applicant maintains that he should have received 5 points for adaptability by virtue of his previous employment in Canada, and that he should have been awarded 10 points for arranged employment. The offer of employment submitted to the visa officer should have been sufficient to award these points as religious workers do not require a work permit to be allowed to work in Canada.
[17]
The respondent for his part maintains that while religious workers are temporarily exempt from requiring work permits to perform religious duties in Canada, they are not eligible to receive additional points for arranged employment or adaptability because they do not hold work permits.
[18]
On the first issue of adaptability, subsection 83(4) of the
Regulations
clearly states that 5 points will be awarded in cases where the applicant or accompanying spouse/common law partner engaged in at least one year of full-time work in Canada "under a work permit". On the second issue of arranged employment, section 82 of the
Regulations
sets out a number of scenarios for what may be considered "arranged employment", each requiring that the applicant either hold a valid work permit or, in the situation where the skilled worker does not intend to work in Canada prior to obtaining his permanent resident visa, an offer of employment in Canada that has been validated by HRSDC.
[19]
The applicant is correct in noting that he was exempt from the requirement to obtain a work permit before coming to Canada to work as a Sikh priest as per subsection 186(l) of the
Regulations
. That being said, no further accommodations are made in the
Regulations
that would grant special privileges for workers that meet the requirements of section 186, when applying for a permanent resident visa. Given the various scenarios considered under section 82 of the
Regulations
to be awarded points for arranged employment, had such an exemption been contemplated by the Canadian Government, it could easily have been included in the
Regulations
. The applicant argues that no such accommodations were made because the occupations listed under section 186 have already been determined to have a "neutral or positive effect on the labour market in Canada", as required to issue a work permit under section 203 of the
Regulations
, and thus an exemption is implied from a joint reading of sections 186, 203 and 82 of the
Regulations
. With no evidence submitted to support such an interpretation of the
Regulations
, I find no merit to this argument.
[20]
Furthermore, a cursory look through the occupations listed in section 186 is sufficient to determine that the exemption from the requirement to hold a work permit is meant to accommodate those whose stay in Canada is temporary and dictated by the nature of their work, and does not reflect a desire to establish themselves in Canada. The categories listed in section 186 include business visitors, foreign representatives, students, performing artists, foreign correspondents and athletes taking part in competition held in Canada.
[21]
As it is clear on the face of the record that the applicant possessed neither a work permit nor an offer of employment validated by HRSDC, the decision of the visa officer not to grant the applicant any points for adaptability or arranged employment, and ultimately to refuse the applicant a permanent resident visa, was reasonable, pursuant to the existing
Regulations
.
[22]
That being said, it would appear that, at the time the applicant submitted his application for permanent residence, there was confusion at Citizenship and Immigration Canada concerning the proper awarding of points for arranged employment for priests whose job offers were not validated by HRSDC, as evidenced by the contradiction between the affidavit of the visa officer and the email reply submitted by the applicant, in which the Ministerial Enquiries Division stated that, if you are a priest applying under the skilled worker class:
"You do not need to have your job offer validated by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC). However, you should ensure that you obtain a proper job offer from your employer. Instructions for preparing a proper job offer may be found on the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) Web site [...] Despite the fact that HRSDC validation is not necessary, your employer may wish to have your job offer validated as an assurance that it is a genuine job offer.
"
If you include a properly prepared job offer with your application, you will received [sic] the points for arrange employment.
" (emphasis added)
[23]
This contradiction is sufficient to raise serious concerns that all individuals applying for permanent residence in Canada under circumstances similar to that of the applicant may not be treated alike, a situation contrary to the rules of procedural fairness.
[24]
On this basis alone, the judicial review will be granted and the decision will be sent back to another visa officer for re-determination. While I do believe that the interpretation of the
Regulations
by the visa officer was the correct one, the appearance of unequal treatment that arising from the existence of this email is sufficient to justify that this decision be set aside, in order to protect the applicant's right to procedural fairness.
[25]
Furthermore, I would like to add that I strongly encourage the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada to clarify the guidelines concerning the allocation of points in permanent residence applications, for both arranged employment and adaptability, for individuals who are permitted to work in Canada without a work permit under section 186 and who later seek to become permanent residents under the skilled worker class. As demonstrated by this case, it is important that all visa officers and all other employees of Citizenship and Immigration Canada be given the same instructions concerning the interpretation of the
Act
, so that all applicants under the
Act
may be treated fairly. This is not the first time that the Court has had to deal with this particular issue, which makes the need for clarification from the Minister all the more relevant.
[26]
For the above reasons, this judicial review is granted and the application will be sent back to a different visa officer for re-determination, in light of the reasons provided by this Court.
JUDGMENT
1. The application is allowed;
2. The decision of the visa officer is set aside and the matter is referred back for re-determination;
3. Neither counsel suggested questions for certification.
Application allowed.
