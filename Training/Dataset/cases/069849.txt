Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.

Roy, J.
: Discrimination is a scourge in a society. Any society. Its eradication is a just and noble cause and Canadian courts have enforced the law with a good measure of robustness. However, a simple allegation without more that someone has been discriminated against does not suffice to establish discrimination. Indeed, under the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, RSC 1985, c H-6 (the "Act"), a number of legal requirements must be met before a complaint is proceeded with, including that a complaint is not dealt with unless it constitutes a discriminatory practice according to sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act.
[2]
In this case, the applicants allege discrimination against them on the part of employees of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada and they would want for the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the "Commission") to receive a complaint made pursuant to section 40 of the Act. However, the Commission shall deal with a complaint unless one of the paragraphs found at subsection 41(1) of the Act applies. The subsection reads:
41.
(1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that
(
a
) the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available;
(
b
) the complaint is one that could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, according to a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act;
(
c
) the complaint is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission;
(
d
) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; or
(
e
) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.
41.
(1) Sous réserve de l'article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte don't elle est saisie à moins qu'elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants:
a) la victime présumée de l'acte discriminatoire devrait épuiser d'abord les recours internes ou les procédures d'appel ou de règlement des griefs qui lui sont normalement ouverts;
b) la plainte pourrait avantageusement être instruite, dans un premier temps ou à toutes les étapes, selon des procédures prévues par une autre loi fédérale;
c) la plainte n'est pas de sa compétence;
d) la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entachée de mauvaise foi;
e) la plainte a été déposée après l'expiration d'un délai d'un an après le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fondée, ou de tout délai supérieur que la Commission estime indiqué dans les circonstances.
[3]
This is an application for judicial review arising from a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, dated June 22, 2012, dismissing a complaint against Public Works and Government Services Canada [PWGSC]. It is brought under section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC 1985, c F-7.
[4]
The Commission found that the corporate complainant, Shamar Maintenance Inc., did not have standing. Furthermore, after initially requiring the applicants to comment on the application of paragraph 41(1)(
c
) of the Act, the Commission concluded that paragraph 41(1)(
d
) found application and that it should not consider further the complaint made by the applicants.
[5]
The applicants take issue with the findings and seek judicial review of that decision from this Court. They make two broad allegations. One is that Commission's staff was biased against the applicants in that the manner in which they conducted themselves gave rise not only to a reasonable apprehension of bias, but they actually were biased. Second, the applicants argue that the decision to find their complaint frivolous is an obviously unreasonable exercise of discretion which ought to be reversed by this Court. For the reasons that follow, I have come to the conclusion that neither one of these grounds has been established before this Court.
[6]
There was not, in my estimation, an iota of evidence that there was any bias against the applicants nor, for that matter, an appearance of bias. The difficulty encountered by the applicants was that their complaint did meet the requirements of the Act. As for the reasonableness with respect to the decision to apply paragraph 41(1)(
d
) of the Act, the complaint was seen as frivolous in the sense that it was plain and obvious that the complaint did not have a chance of success. However, and contrary to what the applicants seem to believe, if it is plain and obvious that the complaint does not have a chance of success, it is because the complaint does not disclose a matter that can be dealt with under the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. The Commission did not conclude, as it did not have to do, that the words complained of were not spoken. It sufficed that the complaint did not meet some of the basic requirements of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
.
The complaint
[7]
The source of the conflict between PWGSC and the applicants is a series of contracts between Shamar Maintenance Inc.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and PWGSC for the maintenance of a number of buildings operated by the Government. The applicants, including Mr. Kidane Hagos, allege discrimination and harassment because a number of maintenance service contracts have either been allowed to expire without being renewed or, in the case of one such contract, it has been terminated.
[8]
It is not disputed that Mr. Hagos is the principal behind Shamar Maintenance Inc.; it is not disputed either that the contract is between PWGSC and the company.
[9]
Paragraph 3 of the complaint provides in my view an adequate summary of what this complaint is all about. It reads:
[3] The perpetrators have arbitrarily and systematically withdrawn maintenance service contracts from Mr. Hagos because he dared complain to them of the discriminatory treatment they are subjecting him to, and they even tell Mr. Hagos right in his face behind closed doors that he cannot do anything about it!!! In fact, as with all other arbitrarily and racially motivated terminated contracts, Ms. Lynne Bergeron recently sent another notice by e-mail on September 20, 2011 informing Mr. Hagos that his maintenance contract EK219-093406/001/FK, at the Health Protection Building ("HPB"), number 7, will not be renewed come September 30, 2011.
[10]
The complaint goes on to allege that the dispute between the company and the Government on the non-performance of the maintenance contracts was actually motivated by racism towards Shamar and Mr. Hagos.
[11]
In order to support those allegations of racism, the complainants referred in their complaint to utterances they claim were made over time by PWGSC's employees.
[12]
A careful and fair reading of the complaint can only leave the reader with the conclusion that there was a commercial dispute between the company and PWGSC resulting in seven maintenance contracts not being renewed or terminated. The complainants want to give these non-renewals or terminations a racial overtone.
The decision
[13]
The decision of the Commission in this matter was made on June 22, 2012. The Commission is tasked by law with investigating a complaint and determining whether there is a reasonable basis for it to proceed to the next stage. It concluded that the matter was not to be pursued further. Thus, "the Commission decided, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(
d
) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, not to deal with the complaint." The record of decision states as the reasons for decision:
Corporate entities do not have the requisite standing to file a human rights complaint. While the complaint was filed in the name of the CEO of the Shamar, the termination of the contract by the respondent, regardless of any adverse impact it may have on the complainants' commercial endeavours, does not constitute an act of discrimination has contemplated by the Act. As such, the matter is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission.
[14]
As instructed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
] the adequacy of reasons is not anymore a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision (at paragraph 14). The lack of adequate reasons does not give rise anymore to successful procedural fairness arguments. Rather they have to be considered with the record as a whole in order to decide if the decision is reasonable. In the case at hand, the Court will also have to consider the report made by an officer of the Commission which looked into the complaint made and provided a recommendation which was followed. Indeed, the record of decision reflects
verbatim
the conclusion reached by the officer with the exception that after the quoted words from the reasons for decision, the report added: "Thus, the complaint is frivolous."
[15]
An examination of the report under section 41 of the Act shows clearly that the two complainants were dealt with. Having concluded that the corporation is not an individual who may be the victim of a discriminatory practice, the report goes on to examine more carefully the situation of the other complainant. The central issue of the complaint of Mr. Hagos is considered to be "whether alleged treatment and termination of the contract were due to the complainant's race (Black), national or ethnic origin (Eritrean), or colour (brown)?" The officer goes on to state that "[W]hile the decisions of the respondent terminated one of its contracts with the complainant, this was not appear [
sic
] to have been due to a ground of discrimination listed in section 2 or 3 of the Act but rather as a result of the business relationship with Shamar."
[16]
Accordingly, the officer was of the view that the complaint is frivolous as the notion is understood in our law. It was plain and obvious, in his view, that the complaint could not be successful because it was about a commercial dispute and the termination of the contracts was not due to a ground of discrimination as they are listed in the Act.
Issues
[17]
As indicated before, the applicants contend that the Commission and its officers were biased against them. They also contend that their ability to respond to the examination conducted by the Commission under section 41 was deficient, thus raising procedural fairness issues. Finally, their complaint was not frivolous. I will examine these allegations in turn.
Standard of review
[18]
With respect to allegations of bias and lack of procedural fairness, the standard of review is correctness and no deference is owed. The parties agree (see generally
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada
, by Brown & Evans, Carswell, #7:1600 et al.).
[19]
As for the issue of whether or not the Commission ought to have declined to pursue the matter further in application of paragraph 41(1)(
d
), the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] as amplified in
Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , leads inexorably to the conclusion that a reasonableness standard applies:
[53] Where the question is one of fact, discretion or policy, deference will usually apply automatically (
Mossop
, at pp. 599-600;
Dr. Q
, at para. 29;
Suresh
, at paras. 29-30). We believe that the same standard must apply to the review of questions where the legal and factual issues are intertwined with and cannot be readily separated.
Analysis
[20]
Three issues were raised. First, the Commission was biased against the applicants. Second, procedural fairness was deficient in that, in the words of counsel for the applicants, the Commission used a "shifting post strategy". In essence, the Commission is not allowed to consider paragraph 41(1)(
d
) if it has already sought the parties' position on paragraph 41(1)(
c
). Actually the applicants also argue that the "shifting post strategy" was for the purpose of finding a ground that would be "rather vague and arbitrary" (paragraph 41(1)(
d
)) in order to decline to pursue the complaint. Thirdly, the applicants argue that the Commission was mistaken to deny the complaint on the basis of paragraph 41(1)(
d
).
1.
Corporation as victim of discriminatory practices
[21]
Before addressing the three issues, the Court should dispose of the argument that the Commission was wrong to have concluded that a corporation cannot be the victim of discriminatory practices under the Act.
[22]
The Commission relied on the decision of this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The case, which is concerned with the Canadian Human Rights Commission and its application of section 41 of the Act in the case of alleged discrimination of a government department against a corporation, is on all fours. The Commission referred specifically to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in order to conclude that the complaint made by Shamar cannot be proceeded with because, in the words of this Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[28] . . . The Commission did not have the jurisdiction to deal with a complaint alleging discriminatory practices against a corporation such as Biomedica.
[23]
The case stands also for the proposition that the shareholder, as an individual, cannot stand in the place of the corporation in order to fill the gap if the discriminatory practice by the government institution is against the corporation.
[24]
The applicants have argued that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was reversed by the Federal Court of Appeal at 2008 FCA 170. They cite one sentence of paragraph 3 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : "To the extent that the appellant is a victim of a discriminatory practice, he has standing to bring the complaint forward and the Commission has jurisdiction to dispose of it." From that sentence, the applicants argue that the Court of Appeal has decided that corporations have standing.
[25]
Unfortunately for the applicants, the paragraph must be read in its entirety and in context:
[3] The appellant argues that given his close relationship to Biomedica, he suffered financial loss as a result of Health Canada's discriminatory practices and therefore should qualify as a victim, with standing to bring the complaint, for the purposes of the Act. To the extent that the appellant is a victim of a discriminatory practice, he has standing to bring the complaint forward and the Commission has jurisdiction to dispose of it.
As can be readily seen, the Court is merely stating in the paragraph the position of the appellant, Mr. Watkin.
[26]
The Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> chose to dispose of the appeal on an alternate basis. It relied on its conclusion that the alleged discriminatory practice under section 5 of the Act did not apply in the circumstances. As is well known, it is not enough to allege one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination of section 3 of the Act. It must be in relation to one of the discriminatory practices defined at sections 5 to 14 of the Act. If no discriminatory practice is established, there cannot be a valid complaint. That is the conclusion reached by the Federal Court of Appeal.
[27]
There is in the decision no indication whatsoever that the Court of Appeal disagreed with the first judge. In fairness, there is not either anything to conclude that the Federal Court decision was endorsed on appeal. The decision is left standing simply because the Court of Appeal chose another route to dismiss the appeal.
[28]
I would respectfully decline to read in the silence of the Court of Appeal anything. As with denied leave applications, they are not to be taken as being an agreement or a disagreement with the judgment (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 88;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (ONCA)). As a result, the Commission was not entitled to ignore <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[29]
This Court was not asked by the applicants to disagree with <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Had I been asked to do so, I doubt that I would have disagreed with the persuasive reasons given by Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer to conclude that corporations cannot complain under the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. It does not have standing, as section 40 of the Act requires that a complaint be made by "any individual or group of individuals". I fail to see how any of the grounds listed at section 3 can apply to a corporation. Furthermore, the applicant did not raise, and I am not aware of, any case that would support such a contention. Indeed, even the case-law under section 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
is unanimous that corporations do not qualify for the protection afforded by section 15. The Commission did refuse to pursue the matter of the complaint made by the corporation. In the circumstances, the decision was also reasonable. Furthermore, as we shall see later, I am of the view that none of the discriminatory practices required to ground jurisdiction were present in this case.
2.
Bias
[30]
The applicants make the very serious allegation that not only is the Court faced with a perception of bias on the part of the Commission, but rather actual bias took place in the treatment of the complaint made. If these allegations were to be supported by some evidence, obviously the Court would have to step in. However, I have come to the conclusion that these allegations are baseless.
[31]
The applicants make allegations about three Commission's officers. They claim that the fact that the Commission examined the complaint on the basis of paragraph 41(1)(
c
) initially, to then consider it on the basis of paragraph 41(1)(
d
), was a tactical shift, the purpose of which was to create a basis for declining to deal with their complaint. As paragraph 41(1)(
c
) is said to be more intelligible, Commission's officers "shifted gears to a rather vague and arbitrary subsection 41(1)(
d
) of the Act" (application, page 5). They claim that these officers gave PWGSC preference and that they were singled out for being late in producing submissions. They take issue with the Commission enforcing its rules as to the number of pages that are allowed in making submissions and complaints. They complain that two of the officers refused to recuse themselves in spite of the numerous requests made by the complainants through their counsel.
[32]
After a careful review of the allegations made by the applicants, I have been unable to find any support for them.
[33]
Case in point, the application alleges that the Commission shared with the respondent the complainants' submissions with respect to the applicability of paragraph 41(1)(
d
) of the Act, thus allowing the respondent to tailor its submissions, the whole in breach of the "
audi alteram partem
principle, to equally respond to the commentaries by the Respondent before it is placed before the Commissioners?" (at page 8 of the application). For some reason, the complainants believed that the respondent made its submissions after those made by the complainants and that it had had access to those submissions through Commission's personnel. However, the record before the Court, which was available to the applicants, shows that the respondent's submissions on the applicability of paragraph 41(1)(
d
) of the Act were faxed to the Commission on April 4, 2012, at 10:27 a.m. A copy of that letter of April 4 was transmitted to the applicants on April 12, 2012. As for the complainants, their submissions were made on April 7, 2012, after the respondent. Other than agreeing with the report, the respondent had no comment to make. Not only is the record clear that the letter was sent on April 4, 2012, but the Memorandum of Fact and Law of the respondent makes the point vividly.
[34]
Another allegation strongly presented as evidence of bias was that the complainants had been singled out, with some animus towards them, where, in a letter sent by a Commission officer on March 13, 2012, it is specifically referred to the delay for providing submissions on the applicability of paragraph 41(1)(
d
). Lo and behold, the record contains the very same letter, with the same warning about deadlines, that had been sent the same day to PWGSC.
[35]
Finally, the applicants made an assortment of allegations that would suggest, they claim, animus towards them, from the letter of March 13, 2012 asking for comments on the Commission's officer's draft report which refers to paragraph 41(1)(
d
) to letters from Commission's officers that speak in terms of "complainant" instead of "complainants". These allegations are groundless. The use of the singular merely reflects the officers' view that the corporation cannot be a complainant, which explains their focus on Mr. Hagos. As for the March 13 letter, it is true that its author refers to a previous letter which would have indicated that the focus would be on paragraph 41(1)(
d
); the complainants are right that there was not such previous letter. However, the purpose of the March 13 letter was to bring to the attention of the parties the draft report and to seek comments on the use of paragraph 41(1)(
d
). I am hard pressed to understand the importance of a reference to a previous letter. Both parties received the same letter, containing the same minor mistake, and both parties were invited to comment.
[36]
The applicants took issue with the Commission's decision to consider their complaint through the prism of paragraphs 41(1)(
c
) and (
d
).
[37]
They seem to draw two arguments. One is that this is further evidence that the Commission had pre-ordained its ultimate conclusion. It was looking for a way to dismiss the complaint at this early stage. That is part of the bias argument. Second, somehow the applicants would have been prevented from arguing their case.
[38]
Contrary to the applicants' allegation, paragraph 41(1)(
d
) is neither vague nor arbitrary. "Frivolous" is a term of art whose meaning is well known. The motion to strike under the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106, uses language quite similar to that of paragraph 41(1)(
d
). The case-law is abundant to the effect that the test applicable in that context is whether it is plain and obvious that the claim cannot succeed because, for instance, there is no reasonable cause of action. For instance, our Court has ruled in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] that:
[35] Third, the test for determining whether or not a complaint is frivolous within the meaning of section 41(1)(d) of the
Act
is whether, based upon the evidence, it appears to be plain and obvious that the complaint cannot succeed.
[39]
The test under paragraph 41(1)(
d
) is not any more vague or arbitrary than the test under Rule 221.
[40]
There is simply no air of reality to the argument that paragraph 41(1)(
d
) is an instrument that can be abused to reach a pre-ordained conclusion. It is a test known to law.
[41]
Then, the applicants contend that they have not been given an opportunity to comment on submissions made by the respondent. As far as I can see, the only authority referred to by the applicants is
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [
Barrette
] which is not on point. The applicants have sought to rely on
Barrette
for the proposition that the courts will look dimly at the Commission for not having dealt seriously with its complaint. Presumably, that includes an ability afforded complainants to comment on submissions made by respondents. In particular, they referred often to paragraph 22, which reads:
[22] It seems to me, having read the memorandum of fact and law of the Commission and heard from its counsel, that the Commission does not take very seriously the preliminary screening process set out in section 41 of the Act. It is true that the courts have repeatedly held that they would not intervene lightly with decisions of the Commission made in the performance of its screening function under section 44 of the Act and even less so when the decisions are made in the performance of the Commission's preliminary screening function under section 41 of the Act. However, these judicial rulings were made on the assumption that the Commission did in fact perform its functions under these two sections and that it did not do so lightly.
[42]
In
Barrette
, the Court of Appeal was critical of the Commission for not performing its vetting role as mandated by law. Where the Court of Appeal speaks of the Commission not taking very seriously the preliminary screening process, it does not refer to the Commission excluding too many complaints, but rather that the Commission was not vetting properly. Here, the Commission has performed its screening role, albeit not to the satisfaction of the applicants.
[43]
Be that as it may, the comment made at paragraph 22 in
Barrette
seems to me to apply either way. The Commission must perform its role very seriously and not lightly, either to proceed with a complaint or to decline to proceed with a complaint. I have no doubt that the Commission endeavors to do so but, in appropriate cases, the lack of seriousness would be examined under the reasonableness standard. The exercise of a power done lightly will seldom be reasonable.
[44]
To a large extent, the Commission is the master of its own procedure. It must however satisfy some basic requirements. As this Court put it in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[10] That said, matters of procedural fairness are reviewable against the standard of correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Procedural fairness dictates that the parties be informed of the substance of the evidence obtained by the investigator which will be put before the Commission and that the parties be provided the opportunity to respond to this evidence and make all relevant representations in relation thereto:
SEPQA,
above;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[45]
That requirement was met in this case. The March 13 letter was seeking the parties' submissions. As pointed out earlier, the respondent chose not to make specific submissions (letter faxed on April 4). The applicants made extensive submissions three days later; they received a copy of the respondent's response to the invitation to make submissions, dated April 4, on April 12. As already noted, there was no respondent's submission other than indicating its agreement with the report. The applicants were able to comment and, as a matter of fact, they did. That, in and of itself, makes it difficult to complain that no opportunity was afforded to respond to submissions. Procedural fairness was afforded fully in my view: they were given a full opportunity to respond.
[46]
As put eloquently by Hugessen J.A. in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[1] We are all of the view that the Commission fully complied with its duty of fairness to the complainant when it gave her the investigator's report, provided her with full opportunity to respond to it, and considered that response before reaching its decision. . . .
3.
Was the Commission's decision to apply paragraph 41(1)(d) unreasonable?
[47]
The applicants did not make submissions on the standard of review applicable other than to state in their submissions to this Court that "(T)he tactical shift from subsection 41(1)(
c
) to subsection 41(1)(
d
) of the Act is to avoid the strict standard of correctness on jurisdictional issues in judicial reviews at the Federal Court ...".
[48]
In my view, the standard of review of the decision of the Commission to decline to pursue the matter in application of paragraph 41(1)(
d
) calls for a standard of reasonableness. The respondent has referred to decisions of this Court where the reasonableness standard was used (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Reference can also be made to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and especially
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  standard known to the Commission on the basis of the facts disclosed in the complaint. The Commission's decision is discretionary and benefits from considerable deference (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Federal Court of Appeal spoke in terms of "a remarkable degree of latitude where it (the Commission) is performing its screening function on receipt of an investigation report" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 38). These point clearly in the direction of a standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, at paragraph 51).
[50]
The standard of reasonableness carries with it a measure of deference. The Supreme Court of Canada explained carefully what is implied in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[47] Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result. Instead, they may give rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions. Tribunals have a margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions. A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[51]
The Commission's decision was reasonable in that it reached one of the acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and the law. Put another way, it was reasonable to conclude that it was plain and obvious that the complaint has little likelihood of success. There are many reasons for that conclusion.
[52]
The complaint, as framed by the applicants, is about a commercial dispute between a corporation and a government institution. The applicants complain bitterly that contracts they had with PWGSC have been terminated or have expired. The Act is not to be used to arbitrate commercial disputes.
[53]
When read together, the June 22, 2012 decision by the Commission and the report find that there was not an act of discrimination
as contemplated by the Act
. As pointed out during the hearing of this case, it is only a discriminatory practice described at sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act that can be the subject of a valid complaint (section 4 of the Act). The complaint referred to paragraph 7(
b
) and sections 11, 13, 14(1) and 14.1. It was obvious that section 11 (equal wages between male and female employees performing work of equal value), section 13 (hate messages by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking), section 14 (harassment in limited circumstances) and section 14.1 (retaliation because complaint had been filed) cannot find application on the face of the complaint.
[54]
The Commission did not consider either that the relationship between one of the complainants, Mr. Hagos, and the respondent was such that it qualifies as one of employment. Thus, paragraphs 7(
b
) and 14(1)(
c
) are of no assistance to the complainants. It follows that the complainants, including the corporation, cannot succeed, thus making their complaint frivolous.
[55]
The applicants complained that the report focused on section 7 and did not discuss the other sections. It appears to me to be clear that the other sections were hopelessly invoked, without even an air of reality. The only real issue for further consideration was the applicability of section 7.
[56]
During the course of the hearing, it became apparent that the applicants' best argument revolved around subsection 7(
b
) and paragraph 14(1)(
c
) of the Act. They read:
7.
It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly
(
b
) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.
14.
(1) It is a discriminatory practice,
(
c
) in matters related to employment,
to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.
7.
Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fondé sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects:
b
) de le défavoriser en cours d'emploi.
14.
(1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fondé sur un motif de distinction illicite, le faite de harceler un individu:
c
) en matière d'emploi.
There would have to be, however, a broad interpretation of the notion of employment, in order to be helpful to the applicants given the facts of this case. Counsel for the applicants indicated that he seemed to recall case-law that would bolster his argument that Mr. Hagos' complaint could survive. He was given an opportunity to submit such case-law and he did bring to the attention of the Court the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[57]
The applicants argue that the employer-employee relationship must be given a large and liberal interpretation, as was done in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> speaks of three factors that would be assessed and, in the words of Justice Pierre Blais, as he then was, they are: "there is a situation of control, there is some remuneration and the alleged employer derived some benefit from the work performed." In that case, Ms. Lapierre had signed a contract with the Canadian Space Agency which clearly was not intended to establish the traditional employer-employee relationship. She was not to be employed by the Space Agency. Nevertheless, the Court found that the factors listed above were met and agreed with the Commission that it should pursue the complaint for sexual harassment made in that case.
[58]
As can be readily seen, there was a contract between an individual, Ms. Lapierre, and a government institution. That is a pre-requisite in order to consider further the matter, as, "employment" is broadened in the circumstances of the case to include "a contractual relationship with an individual for the provision of services personally by the individual". Hence, without a contract with an individual for the provision of services personally, there is no employment, even for the purposes of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. Subsection 7(
b
) and paragraph 14(1)(
c
) could not find application in this case because there was no contract between Mr. Hagos and PWGSC to provide services personally. The only contract was between the corporate entity Shamar Maintenance Inc. and a government institution. There was no contractual relationship as described in section 25 of the Act:
25.
In this Act,
"employment" includes a contractual relationship with an individual for the provision of services personally by the individual;
25.
Les définitions qui suivent s'appliquent à la présente loi.
"emploi" Y est assimilé le contrat conclu avec un particulier pour la fourniture de services par celui-ci.
The case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> helps to highlight the basic requirement of a contract with an individual. There could not have been employment in our case. Thus, it would not have been reasonable for the Commission to find jurisdiction on the basis of those provisions.
[59]
Finally, the report examined the statements attributed to employees of PWGSC. The report considers that there is only one that may draw a link to one of the grounds listed at section 3 of the Act. The report concludes however that the termination of the contract was due to the business relationship, not that possible link to a ground listed at section 3. I cannot see how such conclusion was unreasonable in view of the facts revealed in the complaint.
[60]
Upon reflection, I wonder if the argument made by the applicants concerning the application of the "frivolous" standard does not proceed from a misunderstanding. As suggested recently by the Supreme Court of Canada, "... legal terms of art are not always self-defining ..." (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The applicants, in their written submissions, seem to fault the Commission because it was pronouncing on the merits of the complaint without even investigating the facts. At paragraph 35 of their submissions to this Court, the applicants speak of "subsection 41(1)(
d
) of the Act is substantive and fact-driven, giving the CHRC the possibility not to deal with a complaint on the basis that the factual matrix renders a complaint frivolous". The applicants seem to have taken the word "frivolous" to mean "foolish, lighthearted, not sensible or serious" (
The Canadian Oxford Dictionary
, Oxford University Press Canada, 2001) instead of "lacking a legal basis on legal merit" (
Black's Law Dictionary
, 7th ed., West Group).
[61]
With respect, the latter meaning represents the scope of the analysis under section 41 and it is the kind of analysis conducted by the Commission in this case. Taking the complaint as it is, the Commission has to decide whether the complaint had some likelihood of success. It concluded that a corporation cannot bring itself as a victim of discrimination under the Act. It also concluded that Mr. Hagos, the second complainant, could not have the benefit of the Act because the prohibited discriminatory practices under the Act did not fit the circumstances presented in the complaint; none of the discriminatory practices invoked by the applicants could apply and the crux of the matter was actually the business relationship between the applicants and PWGSC. Thus, the complaint had no legal basis, no legal merit. The Commission did not even suggest that it was commenting on the statements alleged to have been made. As such it did not suggest any foolishness or lack of seriousness. The matter was to be addressed and decided at a different level. The Commission merely applied the law to the complaint and, without making any finding on the credibility of the allegations, whether the words, if spoken, were appropriate or not, concluded that it could not succeed because it falls outside of the Act. That was reasonable, as the notion is described in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, and the Court must show a measure of deference (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
,
supra
, at paragraphs 17 and 18).
[62]
As a result, the application for judicial review must be dismissed. As for the issue of costs, the
Rules of the Federal Courts
provide a broad discretion. The integrity of at least three officers of the Commission was impugned by the applicants. As I have tried to show, these accusations were baseless. Costs are granted to the respondent. Counsel for both parties were clear that they would be satisfied with rule 407, the default position, unless the Court orders otherwise. In view of the fact that the respondent did not seek higher costs, they shall be assessed in accordance with column III of the table to Tariff B.
JUDGMENT
[63]
The application for judicial review of a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, dated June 22, 2012, dismissing the applicants' complaint against Public Works and Government Services Canada, is dismissed. Costs are awarded to the respondent and shall be assessed in accordance with column III of the table to Tariff B.
.........................
Kidane  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  fléau pour toute société. Son éradication est une cause juste et noble, et les tribunaux canadiens ont appliqué la loi avec passablement de rigueur à cet égard. Cependant, pour établir qu'il y a eu discrimination, il ne suffit pas qu'une personne allègue qu'elle en a été victime, sans plus. En effet, aux termes de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
, LRC 1985, c H-6 (la Loi), une plainte doit satisfaire à un certain nombre d'exigences pour être traitée, et l'une de ces exigences est que l'objet de la plainte constitue un acte discriminatoire d'après les articles 5 à 14.1 de la Loi.
[2]
En l'espèce, les demandeurs allèguent que des employés de Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada (TPSGC) ont fait preuve de discrimination à leur égard, et ils voudraient que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) reçoive une plainte déposée en vertu de l'article 40 de la Loi. La Commission ne statue toutefois pas sur une plainte si l'un des alinéas du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi s'applique. Voici le paragraphe 41(1):
41. (1) Sous réserve de l'article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie à moins qu'elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants:
a
) la victime présumée de l'acte discriminatoire devrait épuiser d'abord les recours internes ou les procédures d'appel ou de règlement des griefs qui lui sont normalement ouverts;
b) la plainte pourrait avantageusement être instruite, dans un premier temps ou à toutes les étapes, selon des procédures prévues par une autre loi fédérale;
c) la plainte n'est pas de sa compétence;
d) la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entachée de mauvaise foi;
e) la plainte a été déposée après l'expiration d'un délai d'un an après le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fondée, ou de tout délai supérieur que la Commission estime indiqué dans les circonstances.
41. (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that
(
a
) the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available;
(
b
) the complaint is one that could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, according to a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act;
(
c
) the complaint is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission;
(
d
) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; or
(
e
) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.
[3]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire découle de la décision, datée du 22 juin 2012, par laquelle la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a rejeté la plainte déposée contre TPSGC. Elle est présentée en vertu de l'article 18.1 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC 1985, c F-7.
[4]
La Commission a conclu que Shamar Maintenance Inc., à titre de personne morale, n'avait pas qualité pour déposer une plainte. En outre, après avoir initialement demandé aux demandeurs de formuler des observations au sujet de l'application de l'alinéa 41(1)
c
) de la Loi, la Commission a conclu que l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) s'appliquait et qu'elle ne devait pas statuer sur la plainte déposée par les demandeurs.
[5]
Les demandeurs contestent les conclusions de la Commission et demandent à la Cour de procéder au contrôle judiciaire de la décision. Ils formulent deux allégations générales. Premièrement, ils affirment que le personnel de la Commission avait un parti pris contre eux, puisque son comportement non seulement suscitait une crainte raisonnable de partialité, mais témoignait réellement d'un parti pris contre eux. Deuxièmement, les demandeurs soutiennent que la décision selon laquelle leur plainte était frivole constitue manifestement un exercice déraisonnable du pouvoir discrétionnaire de la Commission et doit être infirmée par la Cour. Pour les motifs qui suivent, j'ai conclu que le fondement d'aucune de ces deux allégations n'avait été établi devant la Cour.
[6]
J'estime qu'il n'y a pas la moindre preuve d'un quelconque parti pris contre les demandeurs, ni même d'une apparence de partialité. Le problème auquel les demandeurs ont fait face tenait au fait que leur plainte ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences de la Loi. Quant au caractère raisonnable de la décision d'appliquer l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la Loi, la plainte a été jugée frivole, parce qu'il était manifeste et évident qu'elle était vouée à l'échec. Contrairement à ce que les demandeurs semblent croire, toutefois, la raison pour laquelle il est manifeste et évident que la plainte est vouée à l'échec est qu'elle n'est pas fondée sur une question pouvant être examinée dans le cadre de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
. La Commission n'a pas conclu que les propos faisant l'objet de la plainte n'ont pas été tenus, car elle n'a pas eu à le faire. Il lui a suffi de conclure que la plainte ne satisfaisait pas à certaines des exigences fondamentales de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
.
La plainte
[7]
La source du conflit entre TPSGC et les demandeurs est une série de contrats conclus entre Shamar Maintenance Inc. (Shamar) et TPSGC pour l'entretien d'un certain nombre d'immeubles utilisés par le gouvernement. Les demandeurs, dont M. Kidane Hagos, allèguent qu'il y a eu discrimination et harcèlement, car un certain nombre de contrats de services d'entretien ont pris fin et n'ont pas été renouvelés et qu'un de ces contrats a été résilié.
[8]
Le fait que M. Hagos est actionnaire principal de Shamar Maintenance Inc. n'est pas contesté, et le fait que le contrat a été conclu entre TPSGC et la société n'est pas contesté non plus.
[9]
Le paragraphe 3 de la plainte en résume bien l'objet à mon avis. Le voici:
[TRADUCTION]
[3] Les auteurs des actes discriminatoires ont arbitrairement et systématiquement enlevé les contrats de services d'entretien à M. Hagos, parce qu'il avait osé se plaindre auprès d'eux du traitement discriminatoire qu'ils lui faisaient subir, et ils ont été jusqu'à affirmer devant M. Hagos, mais à l'abri des regards, qu'il ne pouvait rien y faire!!! En fait, comme dans le cas de tous les autres contrats résiliés pour des motifs arbitraires et racistes, Mme Lynne Bergeron a récemment fait parvenir un autre avis à M. Hagos par courriel, le 20 septembre 2011 pour l'informer du fait que son contrat no EK219-093406/001/FK visant la prestation de services d'entretien à l'Immeuble de protection de la santé (IPS), numéro 7, ne serait pas renouvelé et prendrait fin le 30 septembre 2011.
[10]
Il est allégué plus loin dans la plainte que le conflit entre la société et le gouvernement au sujet de la non-exécution des contrats d'entretien était en réalité motivé par le racisme à l'endroit de Shamar et de M. Hagos.
[11]
À l'appui de ces allégations de racisme, les plaignants citent dans leur plainte des propos que les employés de TPSGC auraient tenus à divers moments.
[12]
À la lecture attentive et objective de la plainte, le lecteur ne peut que conclure à l'existence d'un litige de nature commerciale entre la société et TPSGC ayant donné lieu à la résiliation ou au non-renouvellement de sept contrats d'entretien. Les plaignants tentent de donner une connotation raciale à ces non-renouvellements et résiliations.
La décision
[13]
La Commission a rendu sa décision le 22 juin 2012. La loi exige de la Commission qu'elle enquête sur les plaintes qu'elle reçoit pour déterminer si elles sont dotées d'un fondement raisonnable permettant la poursuite de leur traitement. En l'espèce, la Commission a conclu qu'elle ne devait pas poursuivre l'examen de la plainte. Ainsi, [TRADUCTION] « la Commission a décidé, conformément à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne,
de ne pas statuer sur la plainte ». Les motifs de la décision sont les suivants, d'après le compte rendu de décision:
[TRADUCTION]
Les personnes morales n'ont pas qualité pour déposer une plainte en matière de droits de la personne. La plainte a été déposée par le PDG de Shamar, mais la résiliation du contrat par le défendeur, peu importe les répercussions négatives qu'elle pourrait avoir sur les activités commerciales des plaignants, ne constitue pas un acte de discrimination au sens de la Loi. L'affaire ne relève donc pas de la compétence de la Commission.
[14]
Comme la Cour suprême du Canada le précise dans
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
), l'insuffisance des motifs ne permet plus à elle seule de casser une décision (au paragraphe 14). L'insuffisance des motifs ne permet plus de faire valoir des arguments touchant l'équité procédurale. Il convient plutôt examiner les motifs dans le contexte de l'ensemble du dossier pour décider si une décision est raisonnable. En l'espèce, la Cour devra aussi tenir compte du rapport rédigé par un agent de la Commission ayant examiné la plainte, qui contient une recommandation ayant été suivie par la Commission. En effet, le compte rendu des décisions cite textuellement la conclusion, sauf pour une phrase suivant l'extrait des motifs de décision: [TRADUCTION] « La plainte est donc frivole. »
[15]
L'examen du rapport relatif à l'article 41 de la Loi montre clairement que les deux plaignants ont reçu une réponse à leur plainte. Après avoir conclu que la personne morale n'était pas une personne physique pouvant être victime d'un acte discriminatoire, l'agent de la Commission examine de plus près la situation de l'autre plaignant. La question considérée comme étant au cœur de la plainte de M. Hagos est de savoir [TRADUCTION] « si le traitement allégué et la résiliation du contrat étaient attribuables à la race (Noir), à l'origine nationale ou ethnique (Érythréen) ou à la couleur (brun) du plaignant ». L'agent ajoute [TRADUCTION] « [L] es décisions du défendeur sont à l'origine de la résiliation de l'un de ses contrats avec le plaignant, mais elles semblent être fondées non pas sur un motif de discrimination figurant à l'article 2 ou à l'article 3 de la Loi, mais plutôt sur la relation d'affaires avec Shamar ».
[16]
Par conséquent, l'agent était d'avis que la plainte était frivole au sens donné à ce terme en droit canadien. Selon lui, il était manifeste et évident que la plainte était vouée à l'échec, puisqu'elle concernait un litige commercial et que la résiliation des contrats n'était pas fondée sur un motif de discrimination prévu par la Loi.
Les questions en litige
[17]
J'ai déjà dit que les demandeurs affirment que la Commission et ses agents avaient un parti pris contre eux. Ils affirment également qu'ils n'ont pu réagir adéquatement à l'examen mené par la Commission en vertu de l'article 41, ce qui soulève selon eux des questions d'équité procédurale. Enfin, ils soutiennent que leur plainte n'était pas frivole. Je vais examiner chacune de ses allégations.
La norme de contrôle
[18]
En ce qui concerne les allégations de partialité et de manque d'équité procédurale, la norme de contrôle applicable est la décision correcte, et il n'y a pas d'obligation de retenue judiciaire. Les parties en conviennent (voir de façon générale
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada
, Brown et Evans, Carswell, par. 7: 1600 et autres).
[19]
Quant à savoir si la Commission devait ou non refuser de statuer sur la plainte en vertu de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
), l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), repris dans
Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , mène inexorablement à la conclusion que la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique:
[53] En présence d'une question touchant aux faits, au pouvoir discrétionnaire ou à la politique, la retenue s'impose habituellement d'emblée (
Mossop
, p. 599-600;
Dr Q
, par. 29;
Suresh
, par. 29-30). Nous sommes d'avis que la même norme de contrôle doit s'appliquer lorsque le droit et les faits s'entrelacent et ne peuvent aisément être dissociés.
Analyse
[20]
Les demandeurs ont soulevé trois questions. Premièrement, ils affirment que la Commission avait un parti pris contre eux. Deuxièmement, selon eux, il y a eu un manque d'équité procédurale, car, pour reprendre l'expression utilisée par leur avocat, la Commission a adopté une [TRADUCTION] « stratégie mouvante ». Essentiellement, ils soutiennent qu'elle ne peut invoquer l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) après avoir demandé l'avis des parties au sujet de l'alinéa 41(1)
c
). En réalité, les demandeurs affirment également que la Commission a adopté une [TRADUCTION] « stratégie mouvante » afin de trouver un motif [TRADUCTION] « plutôt vague et arbitraire » (alinéa 41(1)
d
)) pour refuser de statuer sur la plainte. Troisièmement, les demandeurs soutiennent que la Commission s'est trompée en rejetant la plainte pour le motif prévu à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
).
1.
Une personne morale victime d'actes discriminatoires
[21]
Avant d'aborder les trois questions en litige, il convient que la Cour examine l'argument selon lequel la Commission a eu tort de conclure qu'une personne morale ne peut être victime d'actes discriminatoires au sens de la Loi.
[22]
La conclusion de la Commission est fondée sur la décision
Procureur général du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), rendue par la Cour. Cette affaire, concernant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et l'application par celle-ci de l'article 41 de la Loi à un cas d'allégation de discrimination d'un ministère à l'endroit d'une personne morale, est identique à celle qui nous occupe. La Commission cite <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> pour appuyer sa conclusion selon laquelle la plainte de Shamar ne peut être traitée:
[28] La Commission n'était pas compétente pour statuer sur la plainte d'une personne morale, telle Biomedica, se disant victime d'actes discriminatoires.
[23]
Toujours selon <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , un actionnaire ne peut se substituer à la société en tant que personne physique si l'acte discriminatoire posé par l'organisme gouvernemental vise la personne morale.
[24]
Les demandeurs affirment que la Cour d'appel fédérale a infirmé la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (2008 CAF 170). Ils citent une phrase tirée du paragraphe 3 de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « Dans la mesure où l'appelant est victime d'un acte discriminatoire, il a qualité pour porter plainte, et la Commission a compétence pour la trancher. » Les demandeurs s'appuient sur cette phrase pour affirmer que la Cour d'appel a tranché que les personnes morales ont qualité pour porter plainte.
[25]
Malheureusement pour les demandeurs, le paragraphe doit être lu au complet et en contexte:
[3] L'appelant soutient que, compte tenu des liens étroits qu'il entretient avec Biomedica, il a subi des pertes financières en raison des actes discriminatoires de Santé Canada et qu'il devrait par conséquent être considéré comme une victime ayant qualité pour porter plainte en vertu de la Loi. Dans la mesure où l'appelant est victime d'un acte discriminatoire, il a qualité pour porter plainte et la Commission a compétence pour la trancher.
Comme on le voit très bien, la Cour ne fait qu'énoncer la position de l'appelant, M. Watkin.
[26]
La Cour d'appel fédérale a choisi de trancher l'appel sur un autre fondement dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Elle s'est appuyée sur sa conclusion selon laquelle il ne pouvait être établi dans les circonstances que l'acte discriminatoire prévu à l'article 5 de la Loi avait été posé. Comme on le sait bien, il ne suffit pas d'invoquer l'un des motifs de discrimination illicite prévus à l'article 3 de la Loi. Il faut qu'il y ait un lien avec l'un des actes discriminatoires décrits aux articles 5 à 14 de la Loi. La plainte ne peut être fondée si aucun acte discriminatoire n'est établi. Voilà la conclusion tirée par la Cour d'appel fédérale.
[27]
En l'espèce, absolument rien dans l'arrêt de la Cour d'appel n'indique que celle-ci n'est pas d'accord avec le juge de première instance. Il faut dire aussi, par contre, que rien dans cet arrêt ne permet de conclure à l'approbation de la décision de la Cour fédérale. La décision demeure en suspens, simplement parce que la Cour d'appel a choisi de rejeter l'appel d'une autre manière.
[28]
Avec égards, je refuse de voir quoi que ce soit dans le silence de la Cour d'appel. Comme dans le cas d'une demande d'autorisation rejetée, il ne s'agit pas de trouver dans l'arrêt un accord ou un désaccord avec le jugement (
Banque canadienne de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 88;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA ON)). La Commission ne pouvait donc pas faire fi de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[29]
Les demandeurs n'ont pas demandé à la Cour de se prononcer contre <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . S'ils m'avaient demandé de le faire, je ne crois pas que j'aurais trouvé quelque chose à objecter aux motifs convaincants énoncés par la juge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer pour conclure que les personnes morales ne peuvent porter plainte aux termes de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
. Elles n'ont pas qualité pour le faire, puisque l'article 40 de la Loi exige qu'une plainte soit portée par « un individu ou un groupe d'individus ». Je ne vois pas en quoi l'un ou l'autre des motifs énumérés à l'article 3 pourrait s'appliquer à une personne morale. Par ailleurs, le demandeur n'a cité aucune décision à l'appui de sa prétention, et je ne crois pas qu'il y en ait. En effet, même la jurisprudence concernant l'article 15 de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
est unanime à l'égard du fait que les personnes morales ne sont pas protégées par cet article. La Commission a refusé de statuer sur la plainte portée par la société. Dans les circonstances, la décision était raisonnable. En outre, comme nous le verrons plus loin, je suis d'avis qu'aucun des actes discriminatoires devant être présents afin que la Commission ait compétence pour statuer sur la plainte ne l'est en l'espèce.
2.
La partialité
[30]
Les demandeurs formulent une allégation très grave obligeant la Cour à examiner la partialité perçue de la Commission, mais également un parti pris réel dans le traitement de la plainte. S'il était démontré que ces allégations étaient fondées, il faudrait évidemment que la Cour intervienne. Cependant, j'ai conclu qu'elles sont sans fondement.
[31]
Les demandeurs formulent des allégations au sujet de trois agents de la Commission. Ils affirment qu'en examinant d'abord leur plainte à la lumière de l'alinéa 41(1)
c
), pour ensuite l'examiner dans le contexte de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
), la Commission appliquait une stratégie visant à justifier son refus de statuer sur la plainte. Comme l'alinéa 41(1)
c
) est considéré comme étant plus intelligible, les agents de la Commission [TRADUCTION] « ont décidé de mettre l'accent sur l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la Loi, plutôt vague et arbitraire » (page 5 de la demande). Les demandeurs affirment que les agents avaient un parti pris en faveur de TPSGC et qu'ils s'en sont pris à eux parce qu'ils ont présenté leurs observations en retard. Ils contestent la décision de la Commission d'appliquer ses règles concernant le nombre de pages maximal des observations et des plaintes. Ils se plaignent du fait que deux des agents aient refusé de se récuser malgré les nombreuses demandes présentées par des plaignants par l'intermédiaire de leur avocat.
[32]
J'ai soigneusement examiné les allégations des demandeurs, et je ne leur ai trouvé aucun fondement.
[33]
Les demandeurs allèguent par exemple que la Commission a communiqué au défendeur les observations des plaignants concernant l'application de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la Loi, ce qui a permis au défendeur de formuler ses propres observations en conséquence, le tout enfreignant la [TRADUCTION] « règle
audi alteram partem
, car ils auraient dû pouvoir réagir aussi aux commentaires du défendeur avant que ceux-ci ne soient soumis aux commissaires » (page 8 de la demande). Pour une raison quelconque, les plaignants croyaient que le défendeur avait formulé ses observations après avoir eu accès aux leurs par l'intermédiaire du personnel de la Commission. Cependant, le dossier soumis à la Cour, auquel les demandeurs avaient accès, montre que les observations du défendeur concernant l'application du paragraphe 41(1)
d
) de la Loi sont parvenus à la Commission par télécopieur à 10 h 27 le 4 avril 2012. Une copie de la lettre datée du 4 avril a été transmise aux demandeurs le 12 avril 2012. Quant aux plaignants, ils ont présenté leurs observations le 7 avril 2012, après le défendeur. Celui-ci n'avait pas de commentaire à faire, sauf pour dire qu'il était d'accord avec le contenu du rapport. Non seulement le dossier indique clairement que la lettre a été envoyée le 4 avril 2012, mais le mémoire des faits et du droit présenté par le défendeur explique très bien la situation.
[34]
Les demandeurs insistent aussi sur une autre preuve de partialité, tenant au fait qu'on s'en est pris à eux avec animosité, puisqu'un agent de la Commission leur a envoyé une lettre le 13 mars 2012 dans laquelle sont précisées clairement les échéances de présentation d'observations touchant l'application de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
). Or, le dossier contient une copie de la même lettre, contenant les mêmes mises en garde au sujet des échéances, ayant été envoyée le même jour à TPSGC.
[35]
Enfin, les demandeurs formulent des allégations concernant diverses choses qui, selon eux, portent à croire à une animosité à leur égard, l'éventail allant de la lettre du 13 mars 2012 visant l'obtention de commentaires sur le rapport provisoire de l'agent de la Commission, qui parle de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
), aux lettres des agents de la Commission dans lesquels ils utilisent le mot [traduction] « plaignant » au singulier plutôt qu'au pluriel. Ces allégations sont dénuées de fondement. Le fait qu'ils utilisent le singulier plutôt que le pluriel ne fait que refléter le point de vue des agents selon lequel la société ne peut porter plainte, ce qui explique qu'ils ne parlent que de M. Hagos. Quant à la lettre du 13 mars, il est vrai que l'auteur parle d'une lettre antérieure indiquant que l'accent serait mis sur l'alinéa 41(1)
d
), et les plaignants ont raison de dire que cette lettre antérieure n'existe pas. Le but de la lettre du 13 mars était cependant d'attirer l'attention des parties sur le rapport provisoire et d'obtenir des commentaires au sujet du recours à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
). Je vois mal en quoi la mention d'une lettre antérieure est importante. Les deux parties ont reçu la même lettre contenant la même erreur mineure, et les deux parties ont été invitées à formuler des commentaires.
[36]
Les demandeurs contestent la décision de la Commission d'examiner leur plainte à la lumière des alinéas 41(1)
c
) et
d
).
[37]
Ils semblent avancer deux arguments. Le premier, c'est qu'il s'agit là d'une autre preuve du fait que la Commission avait déterminé à l'avance la conclusion à laquelle elle en arriverait. Elle cherchait un moyen de rejeter la plainte dès le départ. Ce premier argument relève de l'idée de partialité. Le deuxième, c'est que les demandeurs auraient été empêchés de défendre leur cause d'une quelconque façon.
[38]
Contrairement à ce que les demandeurs allèguent, l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) n'est ni vague ni arbitraire. Le terme « frivole » est un terme technique dont le sens est bien connu. La requête en radiation prévue par les
Règles de la Cour fédérale
, DORS/98-106, est formulée de façon très semblable à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
). Il y a une jurisprudence abondante concernant le fait que le critère applicable dans ce contexte est celui de savoir s'il est manifeste et évident que la plainte est vouée à l'échec, par exemple s'il n'y a aucune cause d'action valable. La Cour a affirmé ce qui suit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ):
[35] Troisièmement, le critère à appliquer pour savoir si une plainte est ou non frivole au sens de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la Loi est le suivant: compte tenu de la preuve, apparaît-il manifeste et évident que la plainte est vouée à l'échec?
[39]
Le critère relatif à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) n'est ni plus vague ni plus arbitraire que le critère concernant l'article 221 des Règles.
[40]
L'argument selon lequel il est possible de recourir abusivement à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) pour en arriver à une conclusion déterminée à l'avance n'a tout simplement aucune apparence de vraisemblance. Le critère est bien établi en droit.
[41]
Les demandeurs affirment ensuite qu'ils n'ont pas eu la possibilité de commenter les observations du défendeur. D'après ce que je peux voir, les demandeurs ne citent que l'arrêt
Société canadienne des postes c Barrette
, [2000] 4 CF 145 (
Barrette
), qui n'est pas tout à fait pertinent. Les demandeurs cherchent à s'appuyer sur
Barrette
, parce qu'ils pensent que les cours envisageront d'un mauvais œil le fait que la Commission n'ait pas pris leur plainte au sérieux. Il est présumé qu'il faut que les plaignants aient la possibilité de commenter les observations faites par les défendeurs. Les demandeurs citent souvent le paragraphe 22 en particulier:
[22] Il me semble, après avoir lu l'exposé des faits et du droit de la Commission et entendu la plaidoirie de son avocate, que la Commission n'a pas vraiment pris au sérieux le processus d'examen préalable prévu à l'article 41 de la Loi. Il est vrai que les cours ont maintes fois statué qu'elles n'infirmeraient pas à la légère des décisions que la Commission a prises en vertu du processus d'examen préalable prévu à l'article 44 de la Loi, et à plus forte raison pour ce qui est des décisions prises en vertu du processus prévu à l'article 41 de la Loi. Cependant, les cours ont rendu ces décisions après avoir supposé que la Commission avait effectivement exercé ses fonctions en vertu de ces deux articles et qu'elle ne s'était pas acquittée de sa tâche à la légère.

, la Cour d'appel critique la Commission, parce que celle-ci ne s'est pas acquittée de son mandat de vérification du bien-fondé des plaintes prévu par la loi. Lorsque la Cour d'appel parle du fait que la Commission ne prend pas le processus d'examen préalable très au sérieux, elle parle non pas de l'exclusion d'un trop grand nombre de plaintes, mais plutôt d'une vérification inadéquate du bien-fondé des plaintes. En l'espèce, la Commission s'est acquittée de son rôle d'examen préalable, même si le résultat ne plaît pas aux demandeurs.
[43]
Quoi qu'il en soit, le commentaire figurant au paragraphe 22 de
Barrette
me semble s'appliquer dans les deux sens. La Commission doit assumer son rôle avec beaucoup de sérieux, et non à la légère, qu'elle décide de statuer sur une plainte ou de refuser de le faire. Je ne doute pas qu'elle cherche à s'acquitter adéquatement de sa tâche, mais, lorsque les circonstances l'exigent, le manque de sérieux fait l'objet d'un examen fondé sur la norme de la décision raisonnable. Il est rare qu'un pouvoir puisse être exercé à la légère.
[44]
La Commission est maître de sa procédure dans une large mesure. Elle doit cependant satisfaire à certaines exigences fondamentales. Voici ce que la Cour a dit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[10] Ceci étant dit, l'équité procédurale est révisable selon la norme de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). L'équité procédurale requiert que les parties soient informées de l'essentiel de la preuve qui a été obtenue par l'enquêteur et qui sera déposée devant la Commission et que les parties aient la possibilité de réagir à cette preuve et de faire toutes les observations s'y rapportant:
SEPQA,
précité;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 31.
[45]
Il a été satisfait à cette exigence en l'espèce. La lettre du 13 mars visait l'obtention des observations des parties. Comme je l'ai mentionné déjà, le défendeur a décidé de ne pas présenter d'observations précises (lettre envoyée par télécopieur le 4 avril). Les demandeurs ont présenté une grande quantité d'observations trois jours plus tard; ils ont reçu le 12 avril une copie de la réponse du défendeur à l'invitation à présenter des observations datée du 4 avril. Je répète que le défendeur n'a fait aucune observation, sauf pour dire qu'il était d'accord avec le contenu du rapport. Les demandeurs ont pu présenter des commentaires, et ils l'ont fait. En soi, cela fait en sorte qu'il est difficile de voir pourquoi ils se plaignent de ne pas avoir eu l'occasion de réagir aux observations formulées. À mon avis, les demandeurs ont pleinement bénéficié de l'équité procédurale, puisqu'ils ont eu l'entière possibilité de répliquer.
[46]
Le juge Hugessen parle de cette question avec éloquence dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[1] Nous sommes tous d'avis que la Commission s'est pleinement acquittée de son obligation d'équité envers la plaignante en lui remettant le rapport de l'enquêteur, en lui donnant l'entière possibilité d'y répliquer, et en étudiant cette riposte avant de parvenir à sa décision [...]
3.
La décision de la Commission d'appliquer l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) était-elle déraisonnable?
[47]
Les demandeurs n'ont pas formulé d'observations concernant la norme de contrôle applicable, sauf pour nous faire remarquer que [TRADUCTION] « la décision stratégique de recourir à l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) plutôt qu'à l'alinéa 41(1)
c
) de la Loi visait à éviter l'application de la norme stricte de la décision correcte, qui est celle des questions de compétence examinées par la Cour fédérale dans le cadre de contrôles judiciaires [...] »
[48]
À mon avis, la norme de contrôle de la décision de la Commission de refuser de statuer sur la plainte en vertu de l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) est la décision raisonnable. Le défendeur a cité des décisions de la Cour dans lesquelles la norme de la décision raisonnable est appliquée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). On peut également citer
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et surtout
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée.
[49]
En l'espèce, la Cour examine l'application d'une norme connue de la Commission, vu les faits exposés dans la plainte. La décision de la Commission est discrétionnaire et doit être examinée avec beaucoup de retenue (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La Cour d'appel fédérale parle d' « un degré remarquable de latitude [pour la Commission] dans l'exécution de sa fonction d'examen préalable au moment de la réception d'un rapport d'enquête. » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 38). Cela va clairement dans le sens de l'application d'une norme de décision raisonnable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 51).
[50]
La norme de la décision raisonnable s'assortit d'une certaine déférence. La Cour suprême du Canada a expliqué avec soin ce que suppose l'application de cette norme dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[47] La norme déférente du caractère raisonnable procède du principe à l'origine des deux normes antérieures de raisonnabilité: certaines questions soumises aux tribunaux administratifs n'appellent pas une seule solution précise, mais peuvent plutôt donner lieu à un certain nombre de conclusions raisonnables. Il est loisible au tribunal administratif d'opter pour l'une ou l'autre des différentes solutions rationnelles acceptables. La cour de révision se demande dès lors si la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité. Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[51]
La décision de la Commission était raisonnable, puisqu'elle faisait partie des issues acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Autrement dit, il était raisonnable de conclure qu'il était manifeste et évident que la plainte avait peu de chance d'être accueillie. Cette conclusion est fondée sur de nombreuses raisons.
[52]
La plainte que présentent les demandeurs concerne un litige commercial entre une société et une institution gouvernementale. Les demandeurs se plaignent amèrement du fait que des contrats qu'ils avaient avec TPSGC aient été résiliés ou aient pris fin. La Loi ne doit pas être utilisée pour l'arbitrage de litiges commerciaux.
[53]
La lecture de la décision du 22 juin 2012 de la Commission et du rapport permet de conclure qu'il n'y a pas eu d'acte de discrimination
au sens de la Loi
. Comme cela a été précisé pendant l'audience, seuls les actes discriminatoires prévus aux articles 5 à 14.1 peuvent faire l'objet d'une plainte valide (article 4 de la Loi). Dans leur plainte, les demandeurs parlent de l'alinéa 7
b
), du paragraphe 14(1) et des articles 11, 13 et 14.1. Vu le contenu de la plainte, il est évident que les articles 11 (salaire égal pour les hommes et les femmes qui exécutent des fonctions équivalentes), 13 (propagande haineuse au moyen des services d'une entreprise de télécommunication), 14 (harcèlement dans certaines circonstances) et 14.1 (représailles parce qu'une plainte a été déposée) ne s'appliquent pas.
[54]
La Commission n'a pas jugé non plus que la relation entre l'un des plaignants, M. Hagos, et le défendeur pouvait être considérée comme étant une relation d'emploi. Ainsi, les alinéas 7
b
) et 14(1)
c
) ne sont d'aucune utilité aux plaignants. Il s'ensuit que les plaignants, dont la société, ne peuvent avoir gain de cause, et donc que leur plainte est frivole.
[55]
Les demandeurs se sont plaints du fait que le rapport portait sur l'article 7 et n'abordait pas les autres articles. Il me semble clair que les autres articles ont été invoqués en désespoir de cause, sans même une apparence de vraisemblance. La seule vraie question à examiner était celle de savoir si l'article 7 s'appliquait.
[56]
Durant l'audience, il est devenu évident que le meilleur argument des demandeurs était fondé sur les alinéas 7
b
) et 14(1)
c
) de la Loi. Les voici:
7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fondé sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects:
b
) de le défavoriser en cours d'emploi.
14. (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fondé sur un motif de distinction illicite, le faite de harceler un individu:
c
) en matière d'emploi.
7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly
(
b
) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.
14. (1) It is a discriminatory practice,
(
c
) in matters related to employment,
to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.
Il faudrait cependant que la notion d'emploi soit interprétée de façon libérale pour que ces dispositions s'appliquent aux demandeurs, vu les faits. L'avocat des demandeurs a dit qu'il pensait se rappeler certains précédents appuyant son argument selon lequel la plainte de M. Hagos était viable. La Cour lui a offert l'occasion de soumettre ces précédents, et il a effectivement porté à son attention la décision
Procureur général c Lapierre
, 2004 CF 612 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[57]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que la notion de relation entre un employeur et un employé doit être interprétée de façon large et libérale, comme dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans cette décision, le juge Pierre Blais (tel était alors son titre) parle de trois facteurs devant être établis: « il existe une situation d'autorité, une certaine rémunération est versée et l'employeur allégué tire avantage du travail exécuté ». Dans cette affaire, Mme Lapierre avait signé avec l'Agence spatiale canadienne un contrat ne devant clairement pas donner lieu à l'établissement d'une relation employeur-employé normale. Mme Lapierre ne devenait pas l'employée de l'Agence spatiale. Néanmoins, la Cour a conclu que les facteurs susmentionnés étaient présents, et elle était d'accord avec la Commission pour dire que celle-ci devait statuer sur la plainte de harcèlement sexuel qui avait été déposée.
[58]
Comme on est à même de le constater, il y avait dans cette affaire un contrat entre une personne, Mme Lapierre, et une institution gouvernementale. Il s'agit d'une condition nécessaire pour que la Commission statue sur la plainte, puisque la définition d' « emploi » est alors élargie pour inclure un « contrat conclu avec un particulier pour la fourniture de services par celui-ci ». Ainsi, s'il n'y a pas de contrat conclu avec un particulier pour la prestation de services par celui-ci, il n'y a pas de relation d'emploi, même aux fins de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
. Les alinéas 7
b
) et 14(1)
c
) ne peuvent s'appliquer en l'espèce, puisqu'il n'y avait pas de contrat conclu entre TPSGC et M. Hagos pour la fourniture de services par celui-ci. Le seul contrat existant avait été conclu entre la société Shamar Maintenance Inc. et une institution gouvernementale. Il n'y avait pas de relation contractuelle au sens de l'article 25 de la Loi:
25. Les définitions qui suivent s'appliquent à la présente loi.
"emploi" Y est assimilé le contrat conclu avec un particulier pour la fourniture de services par celui-ci.
25. In this Act,
"employment" includes a contractual relationship with an individual for the provision of services personally by the individual;
La décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> met en lumière l'exigence fondamentale concernant l'existence d'un contrat conclu avec un particulier. Il ne pouvait exister de relation d'emploi dans l'affaire qui nous occupe. Il n'aurait donc pas été raisonnable que la Commission conclue en se fondant sur les dispositions citées qu'elle avait compétence pour statuer sur la plainte.
[59]
Enfin, le rapport portait sur les déclarations attribuées aux employés de TPSGC. L'auteur du rapport estime qu'il y en a une seule qui soit susceptible d'être liée à l'un des motifs énumérés à l'article 3 de la Loi. Il conclut cependant que la résiliation du contrat était attribuable à la relation d'affaires, et non à l'éventuelle présence d'un motif prévu à l'article 3. Je ne vois pas en quoi cette conclusion était déraisonnable, vu les faits exposés dans la plainte.
[60]
À la réflexion, je me demande s'il est possible que l'argument avancé par les demandeurs concernant l'application de la norme de la plainte « frivole » procède d'une incompréhension. Comme le disait récemment la Cour suprême du Canada, « [...] les termes techniques propres au domaine juridique n'ont pas toujours un sens évident [...] » (
Sa Majesté la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Dans leurs observations écrites, les demandeurs semblent blâmer la Commission de s'être prononcée sur le fondement de la plainte sans même prendre connaissance des faits. Au paragraphe 35 des observations qu'ils ont présentées à la Cour, les demandeurs disent que [TRADUCTION] « l'alinéa 41(1)
d
) de la Loi est axé sur le fond et sur les faits, ce qui permet à la CCDP de refuser de statuer sur une plainte parce que le contexte factuel la rend frivole ». Les demandeurs semblent donner au mot « frivole » le sens de [traduction] « stupide, léger, déraisonnable ou pas sérieux » (
The Canadian Oxford Dictionary
, Oxford University Press Canada, 2001), plutôt que de [TRADUCTION] « dénué de fondement juridique » (
Black's Law Dictionary
, 7th ed., West Group).
[61]
Avec égards, c'est ce dernier sens qui est retenu dans l'analyse fondée sur l'article 41, et c'est une analyse de ce genre que la Commission a effectuée en l'espèce. La Commission doit décider si la plainte qui lui est présentée a des chances d'être accueillie. Elle a conclu qu'une société ne peut prétendre avoir été victime d'un acte discriminatoire aux termes de la Loi. Elle a également conclu que M. Hagos, le second plaignant, ne pouvait invoquer la Loi, car les circonstances décrites dans la plainte ne correspondaient pas aux actes discriminatoires illicites prévus par la loi; aucune des dispositions relatives aux actes discriminatoires invoquées par les demandeurs ne s'applique, et c'est en fait la relation d'affaires entre les demandeurs et TPSGC qui est au cœur du litige. La plainte n'avait donc aucun fondement juridique. La Commission n'a même pas laissé entendre qu'elle formulait un commentaire sur les déclarations alléguées. Elle n'a donc pas évoqué de stupidité ou de manque de sérieux. Elle a affirmé que l'affaire devait être examinée et tranchée par une autre instance. La Commission n'a fait qu'appliquer la loi à la plainte, et, sans en arriver à aucune conclusion au sujet de la crédibilité des allégations ni décider si les propos tenus, le cas échéant, étaient appropriés ou non, elle a conclu que la plainte ne pouvait être accueillie, parce que la Loi ne s'y appliquait pas. La décision était raisonnable, l'idée étant exposée dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, et la Cour doit se montrer déférente (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, précité, aux paragraphes 17 et 18).
[62]
Par conséquent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée. Quant aux dépens, les
Règles des Cours fédérales
prévoient un vaste pouvoir discrétionnaire. L'intégrité d'au moins trois agents de la Commission a été attaquée par les demandeurs. Comme j'ai essayé de le démontrer, les accusations étaient dénuées de fondement. Le défendeur a droit aux dépens. Les deux avocats ont précisé que l'application de l'article 407 des Règles les satisferait. C'est ce qui est fait par défaut, sauf ordonnance contraire de la Cour. Comme le défendeur n'a pas demandé des dépens plus élevés, ceux-ci seront taxés en conformité avec la colonne III du tableau du tarif B.
JUGEMENT
[63]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision du 22 juin 2012 par laquelle la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a rejeté la plainte portée par les demandeurs contre Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada est rejetée. Le défendeur aura droit aux dépens, et ceux-ci seront taxés en conformité avec la colonne III du tableau du tarif B.
