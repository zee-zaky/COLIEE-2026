I.
Overview
[1]
Shore, J.
: A lack of inherent logic to the Applicant's own narrative, in and of itself, leads to a lack of credibility. When a transcript of the words of an applicant, or his or her designated representative, in a hearing brings out an overall cacophony between it and the written Personal Information Form [PIF] of an applicant, credibility becomes the issue.
II.
Introduction
[2]
The Applicant seeks a judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated November 15, 2012, wherein, it was determined that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under section 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001 c 27 [
IRPA
].
III.
Background
[3]
The Applicant, Ms. Tahmineh Gougoushvili, is a 50-year-old woman from Tehran, Iran.
[4]
According to the Applicant's PIF narrative, she and her husband applied for permanent residence in Canada and were planning to immigrate together under the Provincial Nominee Program.
[5]
The Applicant arrived to Canada on September 12, 2011 without her husband. Upon arriving to Canada, the Applicant was informed that she was not eligible to land in Canada as a permanent resident without her husband, who was represented to immigration authorities as being a successful provincial nominee of Prince Edward Island.
[6]
A few days later, on or about September 16, 2011, the Applicant explains that her husband attempted to leave Iran; however, he was prevented from doing so by Iranian authorities. His passport was seized at the airport and he was subsequently detained and tortured.
[7]
On October 21, 2011, the Applicant submitted a refugee claim.
[8]
On November 15, 2012, the RPD determined that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.
IV.
Decision under Review
[9]
After considering all of the documentary and testimonial evidence, the RPD found that a number of aspects of the Applicant's claim lacked credibility. In particular, the RDP noted that the Applicant's narrative significantly evolved at the hearing, and that there were a number of significant omissions in the Applicant's PIF:
a) The Iranian authorities were interested in the Applicant, and not only her husband;
b) The Applicant's husband had been detained twice after his initial arrest at the airport;
c) The Applicant participated in anti-regime demonstrations with her husband;
d) The Iranian authorities have photographs of the Applicant at demonstrations.
[10]
The RPD further found that the Applicant had failed to provide corroborating evidence to support her claim, which further diminished her credibility.
[11]
In light of the inconsistencies on material facts of her claim, and a lack of objective evidence to support her claim, the RPD concluded that the Applicant had not established her allegations of a serious possibility of persecution or risk of torture or cruel and unusual punishment if returned to Iran.
V.
Issues
[12]
(1) Did the RPD breach its duty of procedural fairness by not providing the Applicant an opportunity to address deficiencies in the evidence?
(2) Is the RPD's credibility determination reasonable?
(3) Did the RPD fail to consider relevant evidence?
VI.
Relevant Legislative Provisions
[13]
The following legislative provisions of the
IRPA
are relevant:
Convention refugee
96.
A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(
b
) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97.
(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(
a
) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
Définition de « réfugié »
96.
A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays don't elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
Personne à protéger
97.
(1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays don't elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
Personne à protéger
(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
VII.
Position of the Parties
[14]
The Applicant argues that the RPD failed to apprise her of concerns that affected her credibility before rendering its decision. The Applicant states that the RPD ought to have informed her of the deficiencies in the documentation provided and of any missing information in her file prior to rendering its decision.
[15]
The Applicant also argues that the RPD erred in relying on inconsistencies between her PIF and her designated representative's testimony to draw a negative credibility finding as the PIF was out of date.
[16]
The Applicant also contends that the RPD did not consider the evidence that she submitted in support of her claim (no reference to specific evidence is given).
[17]
The Respondent submits that there were important contradictions and omissions in the evidence provided by the Applicant and that these elements served as a basis for a negative credibility finding. Additionally, there was no reliable or independent evidence submitted to the RPD to possibly displace its negative credibility finding.
[18]
The Respondent asserts that it was reasonable for the RPD to expect corroborative evidence in support of the Applicant's claim in these circumstances (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (FCA)). The Applicant's failure to produce such evidence permitted the RPD to draw an adverse inference.
VIII.
Analysis
Standard of Review
[19]
The applicable standard of review for the first issue raised by the Applicant of procedural fairness is the standard of correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53-54;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 43).
[20]
In contrast, the applicable standard of review for the issues involving the RPD's weighing of evidence and credibility findings is the standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 4).
(1)
Did the RPD breach its duty of procedural fairness by not providing the Applicant an opportunity to address deficiencies in the evidence
?
[21]
With regard to the first matter raised by the Applicant, the Court finds that the RPD made no reviewable error. This Court has often noted that the RPD may draw an unfavourable conclusion from the fact that a refugee claimant has not produced sufficient corroborating evidence in support of his or her testimony when there are concerns to his or her credibility ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
In the recent case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Michel Beaudry summarized the Court's jurisprudence on this point:
[15] On numerous occasions, this Court has confirmed that the panel may draw a negative inference because a claimant has not produced corroborative evidence to support his or her testimony when the panel has credibility concerns (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 725;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 809;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 680).
[23]
Contrary to the Applicant's position, the RPD did not have an obligation to put all of its concerns regarding her credibility before her, nor inform her of any "missing" documentation or deficiencies that may have been present in such documentation prior to rendering a decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The onus was on the Applicant to establish her claim.
[24]
In any event, the Court finds that the Applicant was sufficiently made aware that her credibility was at issue in this case, and that corroborative evidence was expected from her. In the Notice to Appear and Screening Form, the Applicant was clearly informed that she was required to provide "acceptable, original documents" establishing her identity and the central elements of her claim (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] at pp 36-40); this included, explicitly, her "civil status" and "political affiliations". The Screening Form, in particular, also noted that the Applicant's credibility, which included the "reliability of her documents", was considered a central issue in her claim (CTR at p 39).
[25]
Additionally, a reading of the hearing transcript shows that the RPD also informed the Applicant's designated representative several times during the hearing in regard to its concerns as to the lack of corroborative evidence supporting the claim (Hearing Transcript at pp 9, 16 and 18); however, the Applicant's designated representative did not provide any further corroborative documentation, nor did he provide a satisfactory explanation for why it was missing. He also did not indicate what steps, if any, were taken to obtain documentation to support the Applicant's claim.
[26]
Based on these facts, the Court cannot accept the Applicant's claim that the RPD failed to inform her of its concerns regarding her credibility or the lack of corroborative evidence. The Applicant was given ample opportunity to disabuse the RPD of its concerns.
[27]
As the Court finds that the RPD did not breach this requirement of procedural fairness, it cannot intervene on this ground.
(2)
Is the RPD's credibility determination reasonable
?
[28]
It is well-established that the accumulation of contradictions between an applicant's testimony, port of entry statements and PIF, as well as omission of elements in the PIF, crucial to his or her claim, may legitimately serve as a basis for a negative credibility finding (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Such findings can also be based on common sense, implausibility and a lack of inherent logic to an applicant's narrative (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (FCA)).
[29]
When such findings are made, they are dispositive of a claim; unless the record contains reliable and independent documentary evidence to rebut it (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
After reviewing the submissions of the parties and the evidence on the record, the Court is satisfied that the credibility concerns cited by the RPD led it to a conclusion that was within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes.
[31]
The Court finds that the Applicant's PIF narrative contained important contradictions and implausibilities regarding central allegations of her claim. Likewise, there were significant omissions in her PIF regarding her involvement in the anti-regime demonstrations in Iran and her husband's attempted departure from Iran and his subsequent arrests. A significant part of the Applicant's narrative was only brought out on the date of the hearing. The Court agrees that these omissions considerably diminish the Applicant's credibility.
[32]
In her submissions, the Applicant explains that her PIF narrative diverges from her testimony because it was simply out-of-date at that time of the hearing; however, as properly indicated by the Respondent, all omitted facts in her PIF took place prior to the submission of her PIF. It was therefore reasonable for the RPD to expect that these facts would have been included in the PIF, especially given their significance to her claim; or could have, at the very least, been included in an amended PIF prior to the hearing.
[33]
Consequently, the Court finds that the RPD had sufficient reason to make a negative credibility finding. The negative inferences drawn by the RPD were not just based on "minor or trivial variations or omissions", but rather, on the central elements of her claim (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[34]
The Court does agree with the Applicant that there was an error made by the RPD regarding the date she claimed refugee status in Canada; however, this error, in and of itself, is not sufficient to render the RPD's credibility determination unreasonable. Despite this error, the decision, nevertheless, remains justified, transparent and intelligible, and therefore, cannot be subject to the Court's intervention.
(3)
Did the RPD fail to consider relevant evidence
?
[35]
This Court has repeatedly confirmed that the RPD is best placed to assess the credibility of applicants and of evidence, and its determinations on such matters are owed significant deference ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). As such, in assessing the reasonableness of the RPD's conclusions, the decision must be considered as a whole (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[36]
The RPD does not need to mention every piece of evidence in its decision; there exists a presumption that the RPD considered all the evidence before it (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (FCA)).
[37]
In the present case, it was up to the RPD to weigh the evidence and to make negative findings supported by that evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is not the function of this Court to reweigh the evidence and substitute its decision for that of the RPD.
[38]
When considered as a whole, the Court finds that the RPD's decision was well within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes, and that its conclusions were reached having regard to all of the evidence before it. The Applicant has not shown what evidence could have further corroborated her version of the facts or assuaged the RPD of its credibility concerns. It is also important to note that the Applicant made no attempt in her submissions to the Court to explain what specific evidence she feels was ignored by the RPD.
IX.
Conclusion
[39]
For all of the above reasons, the Applicant's application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[40]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
the Applicant's application for judicial review be dismissed with no question of general importance for certification.

Tahmineh Gougoushvili, représentée par son tuteur à l'instance  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Shore
[Traduction]: Un manque de logique dans l'exposé circonstancié d'un demandeur se traduit par un manque de crédibilité. Lorsqu'une transcription du témoignage de vive voix d'un demandeur, ou de son représentant désigné, se trouve en dissonance générale avec les renseignements contenus dans le Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) d'un demandeur, la crédibilité est mise en doute.
II.
Introduction
[2]
La demanderesse sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue le 15 novembre 2012 par la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié et par laquelle il a été établi que la demanderesse n'avait pas qualité de réfugiée au sens de l'article 96 de la Convention ni de personne à protéger au sens de l'article 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001 c 27 [
LIPR
].
III.
Contexte
[3]
La demanderesse, Mme Tahmineh Gougoushvili, est une femme de 50 ans originaire de Téhéran, en Iran.
[4]
Selon l'exposé circonstancié de son FRP, la demanderesse et son époux ont demandé la résidence permanente au Canada et entendaient immigrer ensemble dans le cadre du Programme des candidats des provinces.
[5]
La demanderesse est arrivée au Canada le 12 septembre 2011 sans son époux. À son arrivée, elle a été informée de ce qu'elle ne pouvait entrer au Canada en tant que résidente permanente si elle n'était pas accompagnée par son époux, considéré comme un candidat retenu par la province de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard.
[6]
La demanderesse a expliqué que quelques jours plus tard, aux environs du 16 septembre 2011, son époux a tenté de quitter l'Iran, mais qu'il en a été empêché par les autorités iraniennes. Celles-ci lui ont confisqué son passeport à l'aéroport et l'ont par la suite mis en détention et torturé.
[7]
Le 21 octobre 2011, la demanderesse a présenté une demande d'asile.
[8]
Le 15 novembre 2012, la SPR a décidé que la demanderesse n'avait ni la qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger.
IV.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[9]
Après examen de toute la preuve documentaire et testimoniale, la SPR a conclu qu'un certain nombre d'aspects de la demande de la demanderesse manquaient de crédibilité. Plus particulièrement, la SPR a constaté que des éléments de l'exposé circonstancié de la demanderesse avaient considérablement changé à l'audience, et que de nombreux renseignements importants n'avaient pas été inscrits dans le FRP, à savoir:
a) les autorités iraniennes s'intéressaient aussi à la demanderesse, et non seulement à son époux;
b) l'époux de la demanderesse avait été mis en détention à deux reprises après sa première arrestation à l'aéroport;
c) la demanderesse avait participé avec son mari à des manifestations contre le régime en place;
d) les autorités iraniennes détiennent des photographies de la demanderesse prenant part à des manifestations.
[10]
La SPR a également conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas fourni de preuve pour étayer sa demande, ce qui a miné d'autant plus sa crédibilité.
[11]
Compte tenu des incohérences entourant les faits pertinents et de l'absence d'éléments de preuve objectifs corroborant la demande, la SPR a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas établi le bien-fondé de ses allégations de l'existence d'une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ou de risque de torture ou de peines cruelles et inhabituelles si elle retournait en Iran.
V.
Questions en litige
[12]
(1) La SPR a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en ne donnant pas à la demanderesse la possibilité de corriger les incohérences constatées dans ses éléments de preuve?
(2) La conclusion de la SPR quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse est-elle raisonnable?
(3) La SPR a-t-elle omis de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents?

VII.
Position des Parties
[14]
La demanderesse fait valoir que la SPR ne l'a pas informée des doutes qu'elle avait quant à sa crédibilité avant de rendre sa décision. Elle déclare que la SPR aurait dû la mettre au courant des incohérences relevées dans la documentation ainsi que de l'absence de renseignements dans son dossier avant de faire connaître sa décision.
[15]
La demanderesse soutient également que la SPR a commis une erreur en se fondant sur les incohérences entre son FRP et le témoignage de son représentant désigné pour tirer une conclusion défavorable quant à sa crédibilité étant donné que le FRP n'était plus à jour.
[16]
La demanderesse soutient de plus que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte des éléments de preuve qu'elle a soumis à l'appui de sa demande (aucune référence à un élément de preuve particulier).
[17]
Le défendeur fait valoir que beaucoup de contradictions et d'omissions ont été relevées dans les éléments de preuve produits par la demanderesse et que c'est sur ces contradictions et omissions qu'est fondée la conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité. En outre, la demanderesse n'a proposé à la SPR aucun élément de preuve fiable ou indépendant qui aurait pu changer la conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité.
[18]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il était raisonnable pour la SPR de s'attendre à ce que la demanderesse fournisse des éléments de preuve pouvant corroborer sa demande dans ces circonstances (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (CAF)). C'est en raison du défaut de la demanderesse de produire ces éléments de preuve que la SPR a tiré une conclusion défavorable.
VIII.
Analyse
Norme de contrôle
[19]
La norme de contrôle applicable à la première question soulevée par la demanderesse au sujet de l'équité procédurale est celle de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 53 et 54;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 43).
[20]
En revanche, la norme de contrôle applicable aux conclusions de la SPR quant à l'appréciation de la preuve et la crédibilité est celle de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), au paragraphe 4).
(1)
La SPR a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en ne donnant pas à la demanderesse la possibilité de corriger les incohérences constatées dans ses éléments de preuve?
[21]
S'agissant de la première question soulevée par la demanderesse, la Cour est d'avis que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur susceptible de contrôle. La Cour a souvent fait observer que la SPR peut tirer une conclusion défavorable du fait qu'un demandeur d'asile n'a pas produit suffisamment d'éléments de preuve corroborant son témoignage si elle a des doutes quant à sa crédibilité (jugement <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
Dans la récente affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Michel Beaudry a résumé ainsi la jurisprudence de la Cour à cet égard:
[15] À maintes reprises, cette Cour a confirmé que le tribunal peut tirer une conclusion défavorable du fait qu'un revendicateur n'a pas produit une preuve corroborante pour étayer son témoignage lorsque le tribunal a des préoccupations concernant sa crédibilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 725;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 809;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 680).
[23]
Contrairement à ce que prétend la demanderesse, la SPR n'était pas tenue de lui faire part de ses réserves quant à sa crédibilité, ni de l'informer qu'il manquait des renseignements ou qu'elle avait constaté des incohérences dans sa documentation avant de rendre sa décision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). C'était à la demanderesse qu'il incombait d'établir le bien-fondé de sa demande d'asile.
[24]
Quoi qu'il en soit, la Cour estime que la demanderesse a suffisamment été informée de ce que sa crédibilité était en cause et qu'elle devait fournir une preuve corroborante. Dans l'Avis de comparution et le formulaire d'examen initial, la SPR a clairement informé la demanderesse qu'elle était tenue de fournir des [traduction] « documents acceptables et originaux » permettant d'établir son identité ainsi que d'étayer les éléments essentiels de sa demande d'asile (Dossier certifié du tribunal [DCT], pages 36 à 40), plus précisément son « état civil » et ses « affiliations politiques ». Le formulaire d'examen initial, en particulier, mentionnait que la crédibilité de la demanderesse, qui était aussi déterminée par [traduction] « la fiabilité de ses documents », était le principal élément en cause (DCT, page 39).
[25]
Par ailleurs, la transcription de l'audience révèle que la SPR a aussi informé le représentant délégué de la demanderesse plusieurs fois au cours de l'audience de ce que l'absence de preuves corroborant la demande suscitait des préoccupations (transcription de l'audience, aux pages 9, 16 et 18); néanmoins, le représentant délégué de la demanderesse n'a pas produit d'autres documents corroborants ni n'a donné d'explication satisfaisante à cet effet. Il n'a pas non plus décrit les dispositions qui avaient été prises, le cas échant, pour obtenir de la documentation à l'appui de la demande d'asile.
[26]
Au vu de ces faits, la Cour ne peut accueillir l'allégation de la demanderesse selon laquelle la SPR a omis de l'informer de ses doutes quant à sa crédibilité ou de l'absence d'éléments probants. La demanderesse a eu maintes occasions de calmer les préoccupations de la SPR.
[27]
Comme la Cour estime que la SPR n'a pas manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale, elle ne peut intervenir pour ce motif.
(2)
La conclusion de la SPR quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse est-elle raisonnable?
[28]
Il est bien établi que l'accumulation de contradictions entre le témoignage d'un demandeur, ses déclarations au point d'entrée et les renseignements inscrits dans son FRP, ainsi que les omissions dans le FRP d'éléments cruciaux à la demande, peuvent légitimement servir de fondement à une conclusion défavorable quant à sa crédibilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Cette conclusion peut également être fondée sur le manque de bon sens, l'invraisemblance et l'absence de logique inhérente de l'exposé circonstancié du demandeur (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (CAF)).
[29]
Lorsque sont tirées de telles conclusions, elles suffisent à rejeter une demande, à moins que le dossier ne contienne une preuve documentaire indépendante et crédible permettant de la réfuter (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
Après examen des observations des parties et de la preuve au dossier, la Cour est d'avis que les doutes de la SPR quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse ont donné lieu à une conclusion qui s'inscrivait dans les issues possibles et acceptables.
[31]
La Cour conclut que l'énoncé circonstancié du FRP de la demanderesse contenait d'importantes contradictions et invraisemblables à propos des principales allégations de sa demande d'asile. Par ailleurs, il manquait aussi dans le FRP des renseignements importants sur sa participation à des manifestations anti-régime en Iran et la tentative de son mari de quitter l'Iran et ses détentions subséquentes. Une importante partie de l'exposé circonstancié de la demanderesse n'a été mis au jour qu'au moment de l'audience. La Cour convient que ces omissions minent considérablement la crédibilité de la demanderesse.
[32]
Dans ses observations, la demanderesse explique que son exposé circonstancié diffère de son témoignage de vive voix tout simplement parce que les choses avaient évolué entre temps. Cependant, comme l'a fait remarquer le défendeur à juste titre, tous les faits omis dans son FRP se sont produits avant la présentation de son FRP. Il était donc raisonnable pour la SPR de s'attendre à voir ces faits inscrits dans le FRP, surtout en raison de leur importance pour la demande ou, du moins, dans une version modifiée du FRP avant la tenue de l'audience.
[33]
En conséquence, la Cour est d'avis que la SPR avait suffisamment de motifs de rendre une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité. Les inférences défavorables n'étaient pas seulement fondées sur « des variantes ou omissions mineures ou banales », mais plutôt sur des éléments essentiels de sa demande (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[34]
La Cour convient que la SPR a commis une erreur au sujet de la date à laquelle la demanderesse a demandé l'asile au Canada; toutefois, cette erreur ne suffit pas en soi à rendre déraisonnable la décision relative à la crédibilité. En dépit de cette erreur, la décision de la SPR demeure justifiée, transparente et intelligible et, en conséquence, elle ne requiert pas l'intervention de la Cour.
(3)
La SPR a-t-elle omis de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents?
[35]
La Cour a confirmé à maintes reprises que la SPR est la mieux placée pour apprécier la crédibilité des demandeurs et de la preuve, et ses décisions sur ces aspects commandent une grande retenue (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité). Ainsi, pour évaluer le caractère raisonnable des conclusions de la SPR, la décision en litige doit être examinée dans sa globalité (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[36]
La SPR n'a pas à mentionner chaque élément de preuve dans sa décision; il existe une présomption selon laquelle la SPR a examiné l'ensemble de la preuve dont elle est saisie (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (CAF)).
[37]
En l'espèce, il incombait à la SPR de pondérer la preuve et d'en inférer au besoin des conclusions défavorables à la lumière de cette preuve (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Il n'appartient pas à la Cour d'apprécier à nouveau la preuve et de substituer sa décision à celle de la SPR.
[38]
Compte tenu de l'ensemble de la preuve, la Cour est d'avis que la décision de la SPR appartenait aux issues possibles et acceptables et que toutes les conclusions ont été tirées au vu de tous les éléments. La demanderesse n'a pas produit des éléments de preuve susceptibles de corroborer sa version des faits ou d'apaiser les préoccupations de la SPR quant à sa crédibilité. Il importe aussi de noter que la demanderesse n'a nullement essayé d'indiquer dans ses observations à la Cour les éléments de preuve particuliers dont la SPR aurait omis de tenir compte.
IX.
