Boivin, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review submitted in accordance with subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (Act), of a decision dated June 20, 2011, by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (panel) that the applicant is not a refugee or a person in need of protection in accordance with sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
I.
Background
A. Factual background
[2]
The facts alleged by the applicant and as stated by the panel are as follows.
[3]
Luis Fernando Alvarez Fuentes (applicant) is a citizen of Guatemala. He is seeking refugee protection in Canada because he says that he fears a risk of extortion and persecution by members of an organized criminal gang.
[4]
The applicant was the administrator of a public transit bus cooperative called Flomitax in Guatemala City. The applicant's grandmother was also a member of that cooperative and owned four buses.
[5]
In January 2006, the applicant's cousin, a bus driver, was the target of a criminal gang (Mara Salvatrucha) that wanted to extort him. The cousin was killed after refusing and attempting to report the situation to the authorities.
[6]
On September 1, 2009, the criminal gang started to extort the applicant. The applicant received anonymous telephone calls ordering him to pay significant amounts of money under threat of death.
[7]
In mid-September 2009, the applicant went into hiding in Zacualpa. However, death threats resulting from the applicant's failure to pay the amounts demanded continued to be sent to the capital.
[8]
On October 1, 2009, the applicant left Guatemala and arrived in Canada on October 18, 2009. He sought refugee protection on October 20, 2009. On June 6, 2011, his refugee claim was heard by the panel.
[9]
On the day of the hearing, the applicant a submitted an amendment to his Personal Information Form indicating that, in December 2009, his female cousin's husband was killed by a criminal gang after refusing to cooperate during an extortion attempt. The applicant noted that his other cousins witnessed the murder and subsequently received death threats to keep them from testifying. They fled Guatemala and have also sought refugee protection in Canada.
[10]
In summary, the applicant maintains that there were three deaths in his family resulting from their refusal to comply with the demands of organized crime.
B. Impugned decision
[11]
The panel stated that the applicant's identity had been established. However, the panel found that the applicant was not a refugee in accordance with section 96 of the Act because he did not provide evidence that he feared persecution based on one of the five (5) Convention grounds. More specifically, the panel stated that the applicant was not persecuted because of his membership in a particular social group or by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion. The panel rejected the applicant's explanation that he had been targeted because of his family, specifically because he is his grandmother's grandson. Instead, the panel stated that, in light of the evidence in the record, the applicant was targeted by the criminal gang for the purposes of illegal gains and extortion.
[12]
Furthermore, the panel noted that the applicant had not submitted evidence that he feared persecution by the police or an agent of the state of Guatemala. Consequently, the panel found that the applicant was not a "person in need of protection"under paragraph 97(1)(
a
) of the Act.
[13]
From the perspective of paragraph 97(1)(
b
), the panel recognized the pervasive nature of social violence in Guatemala and that criminal gangs target certain professions, such as bus drivers and merchants. In this case, the panel found that the applicant had been targeted, but not for his family ties. The panel explained that the applicant's situation was different from that of his cousins who were killed: they had tried to get to the bottom of the attacks and to report the complicity of the police in those matters. In light of the evidence in the record, the panel stated that the applicant would face a generalized risk, not a personalized risk, if he were to return to Guatemala (subparagraph 97(1)(
b
)(ii) of the Act).
II.
Issue
[14]
In this application for judicial review, the Court is of the opinion that the issue is as follows:
Did the panel err by finding that the applicant would face a generalized risk if he were to return to Guatemala and thus that he is not a "person in need of protection" in accordance with section 97 of the Act?
III.
Applicable legislative provisions
[15]
Sections 96 and 97 of the Act read as follows:
Refugee Protection, Convention Refugees and Persons in Need of Protection
Convention refugee
96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
Notions d'asile, de réfugié et de personne à protéger
Définition de « réfugié »
96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
Personne à protéger

b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
Personne à protéger
(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
IV.
Applicable standard of review
[16]
It is well established that the application of sections 96 and 97 of the Act to the specific case of a refugee claimant is a question of mixed fact and law that attracts reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 270 at paragraphs 10 and 11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 222) at paragraphs 12 to 18.
V.
Arguments
[17]
The applicant submits that his family was specifically targeted by members of the criminal gang and that the incidents were in no way random. The applicant explains that all of the victims in his family had a connection to the bus company.
[18]
Furthermore, the applicant states that the panel mischaracterized the subgroup in question - merchants or bus drivers - in its decision. Instead, the applicant maintains that the subgroup to which he belongs is his family. Furthermore, the applicant argues that the panel made insufficient reference to the documentary evidence describing the intensity of the risk merchants or bus drivers face in Guatemala.
[19]
The respondent argues that, in light of the case law and the evidence in the record, the panel's decision is reasonable: the applicant is not a "person in need of protection" under section 97 of the Act because he would face a generalized risk if he were to return to Guatemala. Also, the respondent notes that the applicant is again attempting to provide the same arguments and explanations that the panel has already rejected.
VI.
Analysis
[20]
In this case, the determinative issue is generalized risk. On the basis of the facts in this case, the Court finds that the panel's finding was reasonable.
[21]
The Court recalls that claims based on subsection 97(1) of the Act must demonstrate that the applicant would be personally subject to a threat to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and the risk "is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country." Pursuant to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ No 415 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), a claim based on section 97 of the Act must provide "persuasive evidence (i.e. a balance of probabilities) establishing the facts."
[22]
The case law has established that such a risk must not concern all citizens. As Justice Tremblay-Lamer explained in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the term "generally" was interpreted in a manner that may include segments of the larger population, as well as all residents or citizens of a given country (affirmed by
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 143; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ No 1792). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Tremblay-Lamer observed the following:
[18] The difficulty in analyzing personalized risk in situations of generalized human rights violations, civil war, and failed states lies in determining the dividing line between a risk that is"personalized" and one that is "general". Under these circumstances, the Court may be faced with applicant who has been targeted in the past and who may be targeted in the future but whose risk situation is similar to a segment of the larger population. Thus, the Court is faced with an individual who may have a personalized risk, but one that is shared by many other individuals.
[23]
Furthermore, Federal Court decisions demonstrate that the risk of being a victim of a criminal gang in Guatemala is generalized, not personalized (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1275 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 254;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 38).
[24]
For example, Justice Kelen stated the following in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[34] In this case the applicants were targeted because they owned a small business. The telephone harassment and threats after they shut down their business were a continuation of the extortion. There is no evidence that the
maras
personally targeted the applicants or that they face a greater risk then other small business owners or persons perceived to be relatively wealthy (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice de Montigny).
[35] I am of the view that if the risk to violence or injury or crime is a generalized risk faced by all citizens of the country who are seen as relatively wealthy by the criminals, the fact that a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, does not mean that they are not subject to a "generalized risk" of violence. The fact that the persons at risk are those perceived to be relatively wealthy, and can be seen as a subset of the general population, means that they are exposed to a "generalized risk". The fact that they share the same risk as other persons similarly situated does not make their risk a "personalized risk" subject to protection under section 97. A finding otherwise would "open the floodgates" in that all Guatemalans who are relatively wealthy, or perceived as being relatively wealthy, could seek protection under section 97 of IRPA.
[25]
The following remarks by Justice Near in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1361, also support this:
[20] The Applicant in this case was initially targeted because he was perceived as a wealthy small business owner. He claims to have been attacked a second time because he reported the incident to the police. Regardless, I agree with the Respondent that this does not take the Applicant outside the scope of a generalized risk. The Board acknowledged that while violence by the MS-13 gang was rampant, merchants were more frequent targets. The risk does not need to be faced by every person as long as it is prevalent and widespread (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ No 1792). This Court has stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 415, aff'd 2009 FCA 31, [2009] FCJ No 143 that section 97 can be interpreted to include a sub-group within the larger one that faces an even more acute risk. As in that case, the perception of the Applicant as a wealthy businessman could increase his chances of being victimized, but that does not mean the risk is no longer generalized.
[21] In addition, past threats to the Applicant as a small business owner by the MS-13 do not necessarily amount to a personalized risk (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1353 at para 18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1275 at para 34;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1110 at para 13).
[26]
In the present case, the applicant was unable to identify who or which group he fears and, moreover, he does not believe that there was only one attacker or group (Tribunal Record, page 225). The evidence demonstrates that the amount demanded of the applicant (40,000 quetzales) is within the range of those extorted from transport company owners (between 30,000 and 50,000 quetzales) (Tribunal Record, page 35). Nevertheless, the applicant testified that the money demanded of drivers is minimal, as contrasted with the amount that was apparently demanded of him (Tribunal Record, page 238).
[27]
The panel explained that, unlike Irma Verena Salazar Ortiz, who was threatened because she was trying to find out the truth about the murder of her spouse, Omar Alfredo Marroquin Alvarez (the applicant's cousin), the applicant was a victim of extortion because he was the administrator of his grandmother's company and they were going through him for the money because he had access to the funds (Decision of the panel, paragraph 20; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The affidavit concerning José Arnoldo Orrellana Hernadez does not mention that he was purportedly targeted as a member of the family, and the Court observes that Blanca Ondina Salazar Herrera reported police complicity. The Court also notes that the victims had a connection to a bus company. The evidence to which counsel for the applicant refers indicates that bus drivers and employees may be the subject of extortion or attacks (Tribunal Record, page 35).
[28]
Finally, the applicant alleges that the panel erred in its decision by referring to "merchants" when the applicant is in fact an "administrator" (Decision of the panel, paragraph 24). Upon reading the decision, the Court is satisfied that the panel was well aware that the applicant was an administrator of his grandmother's company (Decision of the panel, paragraph 20). The general reference to the word "merchant" at the very end of the decision, when read in context, is not fatal and the Court cannot find that the panel's decision was unreasonable.
[29]
To summarize, the Court is of the opinion that the panel took into account the applicant's specific situation and reasonably found that he had not provided specific and detailed evidence demonstrating that his family had been specifically targeted by the criminal gang in question. After reading the record and hearing the parties, the Court finds that the panel's decision, in light of the evidence before it, falls within the range of "possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 47).
[30]
For all of these reasons, the intervention of the Court is unwarranted and the application for judicial review is dismissed.
[31]
There is no question to certify.
JUDGMENT
[32]
THE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
1. This application for judicial review is dismissed.
2. No question will be certified.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, ch 27 (la Loi), d'une décision datée du 20 juin 2011 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut du réfugié (le Tribunal) a statué que le demandeur n'avait pas la qualité de réfugié ni celle de personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.
I.
Le contexte
A. Le contexte factuel
[2]
Les faits allégués du demandeur et relatés par le Tribunal sont les suivants.
[3]
M. Luis Fernando Alvarez Fuentes (le demandeur) est citoyen du Guatemala. Il demande l'asile au Canada parce qu'il dit craindre un risque d'extorsion et de persécution par des membres d'une bande criminelle organisée.
[4]
Le demandeur était administrateur d'une coopérative d'autobus de transport en commun, nommée Flomitax, à la capitale du Guatemala. La grand-mère du demandeur était aussi membre de cette coopérative et elle possédait quatre autobus.
[5]
En janvier 2006, le cousin du demandeur, un chauffeur d'autobus, a été la cible d'un gang criminel,
Mara Salvatrucha
, qui voulait l'extorquer. Le cousin a été tué après avoir refusé et avoir tenté de dénoncer la situation aux autorités.
[6]
Le 1er septembre 2009, le gang criminel a ensuite commencé à extorquer le demandeur. Le demandeur a reçu des appels téléphoniques anonymes lui ordonnant de payer des sommes d'argent importantes sous peine de mort.
[7]
À la mi-septembre 2009, le demandeur est allé se cacher à Zacualpla. Toutefois, à la capitale, le demandeur a continué à recevoir des menaces de mort à défaut de payer les sommes requises.
[8]
Le 1er octobre 2009, le demandeur a quitté le Guatemala et est arrivé au Canada le 18 octobre 2009. Il a demandé l'asile le 20 octobre 2009. Le 6 juin 2011, sa demande d'asile a été entendue par le Tribunal.
[9]
Le jour de l'audience, le demandeur a déposé un amendement à son Formulaire de renseignements personnels pour signaler qu'en décembre 2009, le mari de sa cousine aurait été assassiné par un gang criminel suite à son refus de collaborer lors d'une tentative d'extorsion. Le demandeur a noté que ses autres cousins ont été témoins du meurtre et ils ont par la suite reçu des menaces de mort afin qu'ils ne témoignent pas. Ces derniers ont fui le Guatemala et ils ont aussi demandé l'asile au Canada.
[10]
Somme toute, le demandeur soutient qu'il y a eu trois décès dans sa famille en raison de leur refus de se plier aux exigences du crime organisé.
B. La décision contestée
[11]
Le Tribunal a énoncé que l'identité du demandeur avait été établie. Toutefois, le Tribunal a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas la qualité de réfugié en vertu de l'article 96 de la Loi parce qu'il n'avait pas fait la preuve à l'effet qu'il craignait d'être persécuté en raison de l'un des cinq (5) motifs de la Convention. Plus précisément, le Tribunal a constaté que le demandeur n'était pas persécuté en raison de son appartenance à un groupe social particulier, ni en raison de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, ou de ses opinions politiques. Le Tribunal a rejeté l'explication du demandeur à l'effet qu'il avait été ciblé en raison de sa famille, étant le petit-fils de sa grand-mère. Plutôt, le Tribunal a déclaré qu'à la lumière de la preuve au dossier, le demandeur avait été ciblé par le gang criminel pour des fins d'enrichissement illicite et d'extorsion.
[12]
De plus, le Tribunal a noté que le demandeur n'avait pas présenté de preuve à l'effet qu'il craignait la persécution de la part des policiers ou d'un agent de l'État du Guatemala. Par conséquent, le Tribunal a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas une « personne à protéger » selon l'alinéa 97(1)
a
) de la Loi.
[13]
Sous l'angle de l'alinéa 97(1)
b
), le Tribunal a reconnu la nature omniprésente de la violence sociale au Guatemala et que les gangs criminels ciblent certaines professions, tels les chauffeurs d'autobus et les commerçants. En l'espèce, le Tribunal a conclu que le demandeur avait été ciblé, mais non pas en raison de ses liens familiaux. Le Tribunal a expliqué que la situation du demandeur était différente de celle de ses cousins assassinés: ces derniers avaient tenté de faire la lumière sur les assassinats et de dénoncer la complicité de la police dans ces affaires. À la lumière de la preuve au dossier, le Tribunal a affirmé que le demandeur ferait face à un risque généralisé, et non à un risque personnalisé, advenant son retour au Guatemala (sous-alinéa 97(1)
b)
ii) de la Loi).
II.
La question en litige
[14]
Dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire, la Cour est d'avis que la question en litige est la suivante:
Le Tribunal a-t-il erré en concluant que le demandeur ferait face à un risque généralisé advenant son retour au Guatemala, de sorte qu'il n'est pas une « personne à protéger » selon l'article 97 de la Loi?
III.
Les dispositions législatives applicables
[15]
Les articles 96 et 97 de la Loi se lisent comme suit:
Notions d'asile, de réfugié et de personne à protéger
Définition de « réfugié »
96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:

a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,

(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
Refugee Protection, Convention Refugees and Persons in Need of Protection
Convention refugee
96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or

(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
IV.
La norme de contrôle applicable
[16]
Il est bien établi que l'application des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi au cas particulier d'un demandeur d'asile est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui commande la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 270 aux paragraphes 10 et 11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 222) aux paragraphes 12 à 18.
V.
Arguments
[17]
Le demandeur soumet que sa famille est spécifiquement ciblée par les membres du gang criminel et que les incidents ne sont aucunement aléatoires. Le demandeur explique que toutes les victimes de sa famille avaient un lien avec la compagnie de transport d'autobus.
[18]
De plus, le demandeur affirme que le Tribunal a mal qualifié le sous-groupe en question - soit les commerçants ou les chauffeurs d'autobus - dans sa décision. Plutôt, le demandeur soutient que le sous-groupe auquel il appartient est celui de sa famille. D'ailleurs, le demandeur avance que le Tribunal n'a pas suffisamment fait référence à la preuve documentaire décrivant l'intensité du risque auquel les commerçants ou chauffeurs d'autobus font face au Guatemala.
[19]
Pour sa part, le défendeur avance qu'à la lumière de la jurisprudence et la preuve au dossier, la décision du Tribunal est raisonnable: le demandeur n'est pas une « personne à protéger » en vertu de l'article 97 de la Loi puisqu'il ferait face à un risque généralisé advenant son retour au Guatemala. Aussi, le défendeur note que le demandeur tente à nouveau de faire valoir les mêmes arguments et explications que le Tribunal avait déjà rejetés.
VI.
Analyse
[20]
En l'espèce, la question déterminante est celle du risque généralisé. Au vu des faits en l'espèce, la Cour conclut que la conclusion tirée par le Tribunal était raisonnable.
[21]
La Cour rappelle que les demandes faites sous le paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi doivent démontrer que le demandeur serait personnellement sujet à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou de peines cruelles et inusitées « alors que d'autres personnes originaires [du] pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas ». En vertu de l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] ACF no 415 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], une demande fondée sur l'article 97 de la Loi doit fournir une « preuve convaincante (à savoir la prépondérance des probabilités) établissant les faits ».
[22]
La jurisprudence établit qu'un tel risque ne doit pas concerner tous les citoyens. Comme la juge Tremblay-Lamer a expliqué dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le terme « généralement » a été interprété d'une manière qui peut inclure des parties de la population en général, de même que tous les résidents ou citoyens d'un pays donné (confirmée par
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 143 ; voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] ACF no 1792). Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la juge Tremblay-Lamer a observé ce qui suit:
[18] La difficulté qui se présente lors de l'analyse d'un risque personnalisé dans des cas de violations généralisées des droits de la personne, de guerre civile et d'États défaillants est la détermination de la ligne de séparation entre un risque qui est « personnalisé » et un risque qui est « général ». Dans ces situations, la Cour peut se trouver en présence d'un demandeur auquel on s'en est pris dans le passé, et auquel on pourra s'en prendre à l'avenir, mais dont la situation qui comporte un risque est similaire à celle d'une partie d'une population plus large. Ainsi, la Cour est en présence d'un individu qui peut être exposé à un risque personnalisé, mais un risque partagé avec de nombreux autres individus.
[23]
D'ailleurs, des décisions de la Cour fédérale démontrent que le risque d'être une victime d'un gang criminel au Guatemala est un risque généralisé et non personnalisé (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 1275  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 254;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 38).
[24]
Par exemple, dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Kelen a affirmé ce qui suit:
[34] En l'espèce, les demandeurs ont été ciblés parce qu'ils possédaient une petite entreprise. Le harcèlement par téléphone et les menaces dont ils ont fait l'objet après avoir fermé boutique constituaient une prolongation de l'extorsion. Rien ne donne à penser que les

avaient ciblé personnellement les demandeurs ou que les demandeurs étaient exposés à un plus grand risque que les autres propriétaires de petites entreprises ou les autres personnes considérées comme étant relativement riches (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  motifs du juge de Montigny).
[35] Je suis d'avis que, si le risque de violence, de préjudice ou de crime constitue un risque généralisé auquel sont exposés l'ensemble des citoyens d'un pays qui sont vus comme étant relativement riches par les criminels, le fait qu'un certain nombre de personnes données puissent être plus fréquemment ciblées en raison de leur richesse ne veut pas dire que ces personnes ne sont pas exposées à un « risque généralisé » de violence. Le fait que les personnes exposées au risque sont celles réputées être relativement riches et peuvent être considérées comme un sous-groupe de la population générale veut dire qu'elles sont exposées à un « risque généralisé ». Que le risque auquel elles sont exposées soit le même que celui d'autres personnes qui sont dans une situation semblable ne fait pas en sorte que ce risque constitue un « risque personnalisé » ouvrant droit à protection en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR. Conclure autrement « ouvrirait toute grande la porte » en ce sens que tous les Guatémaltèques qui sont relativement riches ou réputés être relativement riches pourraient demander l'asile en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR.

Les propos du juge Near, dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1361, vont également en ce sens:
[20] En l'espèce, le demandeur a été pris pour cible au départ parce qu'il était perçu comme un propriétaire de petite entreprise bien nanti. Il dit avoir été victime d'une seconde attaque parce qu'il avait signalé le premier incident à la police. Indépendamment de cela, je conviens avec le défendeur que cela ne situe pas le demandeur en dehors du cadre d'un risque de nature généralisée. La Commission a reconnu que la violence à laquelle se livre le MS-13 est généralisée, mais que les commerçants sont plus souvent visés. Il n'est pas nécessaire que tout un chacun soit exposé au risque; il suffit que ce risque soit courant et répandu (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 1792). Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.F. no 415, confirmée par 2009 CAF 31, [2009] A.C.F. no 143, la Cour a déclaré que l'on peut considérer que l'article 97 englobe un sous-groupe qui est exposé à un risque encore plus important que celui auquel est exposé le groupe plus étendu. Comme dans cette affaire-là, la perception que le demandeur était un homme d'affaires bien nanti était susceptible d'aggraver son risque de persécution, mais cela ne voulait pas dire que le risque n'était plus généralisé.
[21] De plus, le fait que le demandeur a été menacé dans le passé par le MS-13 en tant que propriétaire d'une petite entreprise n'est pas forcément assimilable à un risque personnalisé (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] A.C.F. no 1353, au paragraphe 18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] A.C.F. no 1275, au paragraphe 34;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] A.C.F. no 1110 au paragraphe 13).
[26]
Dans le cas qui nous occupe, le demandeur n'est pas en mesure d'identifier qui ou quel groupe il craint et, de plus, il ne croit pas qu'il s'agisse d'un seul agresseur ou d'un seul groupe (Dossier du Tribunal, p 225). La preuve démontre que le montant exigé du demandeur soit 40 000 quetzales se situe dans la fourchette des montants extorqués chez les propriétaires d'entreprise de transport, soit entre 30 000 et 50 000 quetzales (Dossier du Tribunal, p 35). Pourtant, le demandeur a témoigné que la somme d'argent exigée des chauffeurs est minime contrairement à la somme qui aurait été exigée du demandeur (Dossier du Tribunal, p 238).
[27]
Le Tribunal a expliqué qu'à la différence de madame Irma Verena Salazar Ortiz qui a été menacée car elle tentait de faire la lumière sur l'assassinat de son époux, Omar Alfredo Marroquin Alvarez, c'est-à-dire le cousin du demandeur, le demandeur est victime d'extorsion car il est administrateur dans la société de sa grand-mère et on passe par lui pour obtenir de l'argent car il a accès à des fonds (Décision du Tribunal, para 20; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). L'affidavit concernant José Arnoldo Orrellana Hernadez, ne fait pas mention qu'il aurait été la cible comme membre de la famille et la Cour observe que Blanca Ondina Salazar Herrera a dénoncé la complicité des policiers. La Cour note également que les victimes avaient un lien dans avec une compagnie de transport d'autobus. La preuve à laquelle fait référence la procureure du demandeur indique que les chauffeurs d'autobus et les employés peuvent faire l'objet d'extorsion ou d'attaques (Dossier du Tribunal, p. 35).
[28]
Finalement, le demandeur allègue que le Tribunal a erré dans sa décision en faisant référence au terme « commerçants » alors que le demandeur est en fait un « administrateur » (Décision du Tribunal, para 24). À la lecture de la décision, la Cour est satisfaite que le Tribunal était bien au fait que le demandeur était un administrateur de la compagnie de sa grand-mère (Décision du Tribunal, para 20). La référence générale au mot « commerçant » en toute fin de décision, lorsque lue dans son contexte, n'est pas fatale et la Cour ne peut conclure à la déraisonnabilité de la décision du Tribunal.
[29]
Somme toute, la Cour est d'avis que le Tribunal a tenu compte de la situation particulière du demandeur et a raisonnablement conclu que ce dernier n'avait pas fourni de preuve précise et particulière pour démontrer que sa famille était spécifiquement ciblée par le gang criminel en question. Après une lecture du dossier et après avoir entendu les parties, la Cour conclut que la décision du Tribunal, à la lumière de la preuve dont il disposait, appartient « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para 47).
[30]
Pour tous ces motifs, l'intervention de la Cour n'est pas justifiée et la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
[31]
Il n'y a pas de question à certifier.
