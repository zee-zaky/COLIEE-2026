Boivin, J.
: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act] of a decision rendered by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (Board) on January 10, 2012, in which it found that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
Factual Background
[2]
Mr. Janarthanan Vaithiyanatha Iyer (the applicant) is a thirty-one (31) year old citizen of Sri Lanka and is of Tamil ethnicity. The applicant is a Hindu priest who finished his studies in 2000. He alleges that he initially worked at the Nagapusani Amman Temple in Vaddukoddai until 2004, after which he began working at the Sari Marugan Temple, Torrington place in Colombo. The applicant worked at that temple until March 2009 when a next door neighbour was allegedly taken in a white van, prompting the applicant to move back to his native place of Vaddukoddai, Jaffna.
[3]
The applicant's uncle was allegedly shot on December 11, 2010 by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) on allegations that he was a supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The applicant claims to have been very close to his uncle's youngest son and to have visited his uncle at the hospital and helped out with the funeral.
[4]
A few days following the applicant's uncle's shooting, three (3) masked men allegedly came to the applicant's house and called his name, accusing the applicant of working for the LTTE and demanding money. The applicant's mother allegedly pleaded the men to leave and told them a portion of the amount of money they demanded could be given the following day. The men agreed and told the applicant to bring the money to a restaurant. The applicant met with the men the following day to give the money. He was allegedly threatened and told that he would be treated as an LTTE supporter and shot if he remained in contact with his late uncle's family. Following the meeting in the restaurant, the applicant allegedly began receiving threatening phone calls.
[5]
Fearing for his life, the applicant decided to leave Jaffna and travel to Colombo. The applicant fled Sri Lanka on December 24, 2010. The applicant arrived in Canada on January 11, 2011. Upon his arrival in Canada, the applicant applied for refugee protection.
[6]
The applicant claims that after his departure, CID individuals went to his parents' home asking for him. When his parents told them he had gone abroad, they allegedly requested that the applicant report to them upon his return.
The Impugned Decision
[7]
The applicant's hearing was held on December 21, 2011. A negative decision was rendered by the Board on January 10, 2012 whereby it determined that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Sri Lanka, nor was he a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
[8]
The Board made several adverse findings with regards to the applicant's credibility and concluded that the applicant did not establish that he was wanted in the past or currently by the CID or EPDP as he alleged. The Board noted that the applicant omitted to mention in his personal identification form (PIF), but testified at the hearing, that he was allegedly held at army checkpoints for questioning about Tiger support in 2006, but was always released after a brief period of time (under one and a half hours). The Board determined, and the applicant agreed, that he would not have been released this way if the authorities had not been satisfied that he was not a Tiger supporter.
[9]
The Board further noted that the applicant visited Singapore in October 2010, and chose to return to Sri Lanka when his visa no longer authorized him to stay in Singapore instead of going to another country. The Board concluded that the applicant had failed to credibly establish that he was targeted in the past for being a young Tamil male.
[10]
The Board also drew a negative inference from the fact that the applicant did not obtain letters to prove he was living in the north of the country in December 2010 when his uncle was shot, and that the applicant's residence is material to the claim. The Board also drew an adverse inference from an omission in the applicant's PIF that his uncle's shooting had been reported in the news, a fact he mentioned in his oral testimony, and the applicant's failure to obtain reports confirming the shooting. The Board also noted that the only indication as to the motive of the uncle's alleged shooting was town "talk". The Board found that, in the absence of any supporting documents, it could not conclude that the applicant's uncle was shot by the CID and EPDP.
[11]
Also, the Board did not accept on a balance of probabilities that only the applicant, and no other member of his family, would be targeted by the CID and EPDP for having gone to the hospital and to the funeral. The Board noted in paragraph 13 of its decision that four (4) of the applicant's five (5) siblings are still living in the north of Sri Lanka without problems.
[12]
The Board indicated that the applicant was unable to explain why his home was visited by masked men asking for money, yet the same men met him in the restaurant the following day, unmasked, to collect the money. The Board also found that if indeed the applicant was visited by masked men and forced to pay a sum of money, and the applicant obliged, there would not be more than a mere possibility that he would be approached again upon returning to Sri Lanka. Not believing that the applicant is being pursued by the CID or the EPDP, the Board gave no weight to the applicant's mother's letter which stated that the CID had come looking for him (Tribunal Record, pp 175-76).
[13]
The Board found that the information the applicant provided in his PIF was inconsistent with the information provided to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) upon his arrival (Tribunal Record, p 156) with regards to his reasons for leaving Sri Lanka and drew an adverse inference from these inconsistencies as well. Namely, on the CIC form, he did not indicate that masked men demanded money from him, he did not indicate that his uncle was shot for alleged support to the LTTE, nor that he received threatening phone calls. The Board found the omission of the demand and payment of the sum of money was material, and found it may have been added later to bolster his claim.
[14]
The Board took note of an inconsistency with the applicant's claim of the CID's interest in him: in his narrative, dated January 24, 2011, he stated that his parents "recently" called him and told him the CID was looking for him (Tribunal Record, p 28, lines 50-52), whereas his mother's letter dated October 25, 2011, claims that the CID was there looking for him around October 19, 2011 (Tribunal Record, p 175). Upon questioning, the applicant said the PIF information was incorrect. An adverse inference was drawn from this as a visit from the CID was seen as an important event that would be properly recalled.
[15]
The Board also noted that the applicant was not forthright with the events surrounding his arrival at the airport, initially saying he had been arrested and his passport taken, only to finally confirm that he had given his passport when asked and that he was not arrested, but asked questions by an Immigration officer.
[16]
The Board considered objective evidence of country conditions. It noted that Sri Lanka continues to experience problems despite the May 2009 defeat of the Tamil Tigers. The Board stated the test was forward-looking, and that there were no reports on remaining groups of the LTTE in the north after the war. The Board noted from a July 2010 UNHCR report that there is no longer a presumption of eligibility for Tamils from the north; that restrictions on movements of displaced persons were lifted, although military and police checkpoints are still present; the country had largely peaceful elections; and there was a reduction in Sri Lankans seeking international protection. It concluded that in the applicant's circumstances, his fear of persecution was not well-founded because his profile does not put him at risk.
[17]
The Board also assessed the risk to the applicant pursuant to section 97 of the Act, recalling that section 97 requires a personalized risk. The Board held that the risk faced by the applicant, if any, was a risk of general violence and criminality.
Issues
[18]
The applicant raises the following issues before this Court:
a. Was there a breach of procedural fairness?
b. Did the Board err in making improper credibility findings?
c. Did the Board err in failing to consider all of the relevant case-specific documentary evidence?
Standard of Review
[19]
Issues of procedural fairness are reviewable on the standard of correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). On the other hand, issues pertaining to the Board's assessment of credibility and evidence are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness since they are within his expertise (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).
Analysis
[20]
On the first issue, the applicant alleges a breach in procedural fairness because the Board did not allow him to address the doubts he had pertaining to his credibility by bringing all inconsistencies to his attention for comment.
[21]
The Court finds that there was no breach of procedural fairness. In the present case, the Board indicated from the beginning that credibility would be at issue (Tribunal Record, p 185). Furthermore, the applicant was directly questioned on many of the adverse credibility findings, for instance: the events at the airport (Tribunal Record, p 186-87), his lack of effort for obtaining a report of his uncle's shooting or news reports pertaining to that incident (Tribunal Record, p 197), the men coming to his home masked and meeting him unmasked the following day (Tribunal Record, p 207). Although some of the inconsistencies may not have been put to the applicant, it does not amount, in these circumstances, to a material and significant issue.
[22]
The applicant also argues that the credibility findings were unreasonable and warrant this Court's intervention. Namely, he argues that the Board engaged in baseless inferences and findings of implausibility, as well as a microscopic review of the evidence.
[23]
The Court notes that in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 727 (QL), Justice Pinard observed at para 10 that "[...] it is reasonable for the Board to doubt the truthfulness of an account when an applicant fails to mention important facts in his PIF but subsequently adds them in his oral testimony [...]". While inconsistencies between the port of entry notes and the PIF are to be taken cautiously because of the manner in which port of entry notes are taken, the PIF is filled out later when the applicant can take the time to relate all relevant facts pertaining to his claim. In the present case, the applicant omitted to include in his PIF that he was allegedly detained at army checkpoints in 2006. There is also an important inconsistency between the PIF and the applicant's mother's letter presented at the hearing with regards to the date at which the CID allegedly went looking for the applicant at his home. These are important facts in the applicant's claim, and it was open to the Board to doubt the veracity of the CID's interest in the applicant due to this inconsistency.
[24]
It was also reasonable for the Board to draw a negative inference from the fact that the applicant provided no documentary evidence whatsoever of his uncle's alleged shooting and motives behind the said shooting. The Court recalls that, pursuant to Rule 7 of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, SOR/2002-228, it is incumbent on the applicant to provide documents to establish his claim. In the present case, there is absolutely no documentary evidence to corroborate the applicant's uncle's death, which is a very important event in the applicant's refugee claim. There is also no evidence of the applicant's employment as a priest. Lack of effort in obtaining such important documents can reasonably result in a negative finding of credibility ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 30).
[25]
Furthermore, the Court finds that the inference as to implausibility that masked men would threaten the applicant only to reveal their identities the following day is logical, reasonable and adequately based on the applicant's testimonial evidence. Given the deference due to the Board in terms of credibility findings, and the Board's reasons outlining several important issues with credibility, the Court is not to intervene and finds the Board's assessment of credibility reasonable in the circumstances.
[26]
On the third and final issue, the applicant argues that even if he is found not to be credible, he could still be found to be a refugee (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). While it is true that a non-credible witness could still be found to be a refugee if other elements of the claim permit it, it is not so in this case. A finding of lack of credibility on several material facts of the applicant's case (namely, that the CID and EPSP are behind his uncle's alleged shooting, that the CID is looking for him, and that he resided in the north) make it difficult to conclude that he is a refugee or a person in need of protection. It remains the applicant's responsibility to demonstrate how risks identified in general country conditions documents relate to him personally (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 274 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 1079 (QL)). In the case at bar, following the adverse credibility findings, what remained was the fact that the applicant is a thirty-one (31) year old Tamil male.
[27]
The applicant submits that the Board was selective in his reliance on the documentary evidence by ignoring relevant information. The Court cannot agree. The Board consulted a recent document from the UNHCR to examine the risks associated with such a profile. The Board did note that the situation in Sri Lanka is still evolving, but outlined several findings indicating a marked improvement since the defeat of the Tamil Tigers. The applicant points to selected excerpts purported to support his argument that the Board engaged in a selective review of the documentary evidence. However, the excerpts the applicant points to are of little relevance to his particular situation: one concerns the Tamils from Vanni - whereby the applicant relocated in Jaffna (Tribunal Record, p 26) - and the relocation in the city of Colombo (Danish Report, Tribunal Record, pp 101-02). Two (2) other specifically concern individuals suspected of having links to the LTTE, which has not been established in the applicant's case (UNHCR Report, Tribunal Record, pp 61-63; Applicant's Application Record, p 189-190).
[28]
Madam Justice Bédard reiterated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, that the mere fact of being a young Tamil male from the North is insufficient to be considered a person in need of protection or a Convention refugee. The Court is satisfied that the Board has not ignored evidence that goes directly against its finding (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). Absent such an omission, the Board is not required to refer to every piece of evidence presented before him.
[29]
The Court is satisfied that the Board's decision is justified and falls within one of the acceptable outcomes defensible in light of the facts of this case and the law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47). The Court's intervention is not warranted.
JUDGMENT
[30]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed. No question is certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi], d'une décision rendue le 10 janvier 2012 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada (la Commission) a établi que le demandeur n'avait ni qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni qualité de personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.
Contexte factuel
[2]
Monsieur Janarthanan Vaithiyanatha Iyer (le demandeur) est un citoyen du Sri Lanka âgé de trente et un (31) ans d'origine ethnique tamoule. Prêtre hindou, le demandeur a terminé ses études en 2000. Il allègue qu'il a d'abord travaillé au temple Nagapusani Amman à Vaddukoddai jusqu'en 2004, date à laquelle il a commencé à travailler au temple Sari Marugan de Torrington Place, à Colombo. Le demandeur a travaillé dans ce temple jusqu'en mars 2009, date où l'un de ses voisins aurait été enlevé dans une fourgonnette blanche, ce qui aurait poussé le demandeur à retourner à Vaddukoddai, dans le district de Jaffna, lieu de sa naissance.
[3]
Le 11 décembre 2010, des membres du Département des enquêtes criminelles (CID) et du Parti démocratique populaire de l'Eelam (EPDP) auraient fait feu sur l'oncle du demandeur par suite d'allégations selon lesquelles il était un partisan des Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (TLET). Le demandeur soutient avoir été un proche du fils cadet de son oncle, s'être rendu à l'hôpital pour voir son oncle puis avoir participé aux funérailles.
[4]
Quelques jours après que l'oncle du demandeur eut été abattu, trois (3) hommes masqués se seraient présentés à la maison du demandeur, auraient demandé à le voir et l'auraient accusé de travailler pour les TLET; ils auraient exigé de l'argent. La mère du demandeur aurait prié les hommes de quitter les lieux et leur aurait dit qu'une partie de l'argent qu'ils exigeaient leur serait remise le jour suivant. Les hommes ont donné leur accord et ont dit au demandeur d'apporter l'argent dans un certain restaurant. Le demandeur aurait rencontré les hommes le jour suivant pour leur remettre l'argent. Il aurait été menacé et on lui aurait dit qu'il serait traité comme un partisan des TLET et abattu s'il demeurait en contact avec les membres de la famille de son défunt oncle. Après la rencontre au restaurant, le demandeur aurait commencé à recevoir des appels de menace.
[5]
Craignant pour sa vie, le demandeur a décidé de quitter le district de Jaffna et de se rendre à Colombo. Il a fui le Sri Lanka le 24 décembre 2010. Arrivé au Canada le 11 janvier 2011, il y a tout de suite demandé l'asile.
[6]
Le demandeur allègue qu'après son départ des membres du CID se sont rendus au domicile de ses parents pour le rencontrer. Lorsque ses parents leur ont répondu qu'il était à l'étranger, les membres du CID leur auraient demandé de faire savoir au demandeur qu'ils voulaient que ce dernier communique avec eux à son retour.
La décision contestée
[7]
L'audience du demandeur s'est déroulée le 21 décembre 2011. Le 10 janvier 2012, la Commission a rendu une décision défavorable dans laquelle elle statuait que le demandeur n'avait pas une crainte fondée d'être persécuté au Sri Lanka pour un motif énoncé dans la Convention et qu'il n'était pas non plus une personne à protéger en vertu des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.
[8]
La Commission a tiré plusieurs conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité du demandeur et a conclu que ce dernier n'avait pas établi qu'il avait déjà été recherché ou qu'il était encore recherché par le CID ou l'EPDP, comme il le prétendait. La Commission a souligné que le demandeur avait omis de mentionner dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) le fait qu'il aurait été détenu à des points de contrôle de l'armée pour être interrogé au sujet de son soutien aux Tigres de libération en 2006, mais qu'il avait toujours été relâché après une brève période de détention (moins d'une heure et demie); cependant, il a fourni ce renseignement à l'audience. La Commission a établi, et le demandeur a reconnu que c'était bien le cas, qu'il n'aurait pas été relâché de cette façon si les autorités n'avaient pas été convaincues qu'il n'était pas un partisan des Tigres de libération.
[9]
La Commission a en outre fait remarquer que le demandeur s'était rendu à Singapour en octobre 2010 et qu'il avait choisi de retourner au Sri Lanka alors que son visa ne lui permettait plus de séjourner à Singapour, au lieu de se rendre dans un autre pays. La Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas établi de façon crédible qu'il avait déjà été ciblé parce qu'il était un jeune homme tamoul.
[10]
La Commission a aussi tiré une inférence défavorable du fait que le demandeur ne s'était pas procuré de lettres établissant qu'il vivait dans le nord du pays en décembre 2010, soit à l'époque où son oncle avait été abattu; or, le lieu de résidence du demandeur est un élément important dans la demande d'asile. La Commission a de plus tiré une inférence défavorable du fait que, dans son FRP, le demandeur n'avait pas précisé que la fusillade dont son oncle avait été victime avait fait l'objet de reportages dans les médias, un événement dont il avait fait état dans le témoignage qu'il a livré de vive voix à l'audience, et du défaut du demandeur de se procurer des rapports confirmant la fusillade. La Commission a aussi relevé le fait que le seul motif donné pour la fusillade dont l'oncle aurait été victime était des [traduction] « rumeurs ». Selon la Commission, en l'absence de pièces justificatives, il était impossible de conclure que l'oncle du demandeur avait été abattu par des membres du CID et de l'EPDP.
[11]
De plus, la Commission n'a pas accepté le fait que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, seul le demandeur, et aucun autre membre de sa famille, aurait été ciblé par le CID et l'EPDP pour s'être rendu à l'hôpital et avoir participé aux funérailles. La Commission a souligné au paragraphe 13 de sa décision que quatre (4) des cinq (5) frères et sœurs du demandeur vivent encore dans le nord du Sri Lanka sans éprouver de problèmes particuliers.
[12]
La Commission a souligné que le demandeur avait été incapable d'expliquer pour quels motifs il avait reçu à son domicile la visite d'hommes masqués exigeant de l'argent alors que les mêmes hommes le rencontraient au restaurant le jour suivant, sans masque, pour prendre livraison de l'argent. La Commission a aussi conclu que si le demandeur avait vraiment reçu la visite d'hommes masqués, qu'il avait réellement été obligé de leur donner de l'argent et qu'il en avait vraiment remis, il n'existerait plus qu'une simple possibilité qu'il soit de nouveau abordé par eux à son retour au Sri Lanka. Ne croyant pas que le demandeur était pourchassé par des membres du CID ou de l'EPDP, la Commission n'a accordé aucune valeur à la lettre de la mère du demandeur selon laquelle des membres du CID à la recherche du demandeur s'étaient présentés à son domicile (dossier du Tribunal, p. 175 et 176).
[13]
Selon la Commission, les renseignements fournis par le demandeur dans son FRP étaient incompatibles avec ceux qui avaient été donnés à Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC) à son arrivée (dossier du Tribunal, p. 156) eu égard aux motifs pour lesquels il avait quitté le Sri Lanka; elle a aussi tiré une inférence défavorable de ces contradictions. Plus précisément, sur son formulaire du CIC, il n'avait pas précisé que des hommes masqués avaient exigé de l'argent de sa part, il n'a pas déclaré que son oncle avait été abattu à cause de son soutien allégué aux TLET et que lui-même avait reçu des appels téléphoniques menaçants. La Commission a estimé que le fait d'omettre la réclamation d'une somme d'argent et le paiement de cette somme était fondamental eu égard à l'issue de la demande et a conclu à la possibilité que ces renseignements aient pu être ajoutés par la suite afin de mieux étayer sa demande d'asile.
[14]
La Commission a constaté une contradiction en ce qui concerne l'intérêt que le CID aurait démontré à son égard: dans son exposé narratif, daté du 24 janvier 2011, il avait déclaré que ses parents lui avaient téléphoné [traduction] « récemment » et lui avaient dit que le CID était à sa recherche (dossier du Tribunal, p. 28, lignes 50 à 52), alors que selon la lettre de sa mère datée du 25 octobre 2011, des membres du CID avaient été à sa recherche vers le 19 octobre 2011 (dossier du Tribunal, p. 175). En réponse à des questions à ce sujet, le demandeur a déclaré que les renseignements figurant dans son FRP étaient inexacts. La Commission a tiré une inférence défavorable de cette contradiction étant donné qu'une visite à son domicile de la part de membres du CID était un événement important qui n'aurait normalement pas dû être oublié.
[15]
La Commission a aussi retenu le fait que le demandeur ne s'était pas exprimé franchement au sujet des événements entourant son arrivée à l'aéroport: il avait d'abord dit qu'il avait été arrêté et que son passeport avait été confisqué, mais a finalement confirmé qu'il avait remis son passeport sur demande et qu'il n'avait pas été arrêté, mais qu'un agent d'immigration l'avait interrogé.
[16]
La Commission a tenu compte de la preuve objective sur la situation dans le pays. Elle a souligné que les problèmes persistent au Sri Lanka malgré la défaite des Tigres tamouls en mai 2009. Selon la Commission, le critère était prospectif et il n'existait aucun rapport sur les groupes de TLET subsistant dans le nord du pays après la guerre. La Commission a ajouté que, selon un rapport du UNHCR daté de juillet 2010, les Tamouls qui vivent dans le nord du Sri Lanka ne sont plus présumés admissibles; les restrictions sur les allées et venues des personnes déplacées avaient été annulées, même s'il y avait encore des postes de contrôle militaires et policiers; des élections en grande partie pacifiques s'étaient déroulées dans le pays; et le nombre de Sri-Lankais à la recherche d'une protection internationale avait diminué. La Commission a conclu que compte tenu de la situation décrite par le demandeur, sa crainte de persécution n'était pas fondée parce que son profil ne correspondait pas à celui d'une personne à risque.
[17]
La Commission a aussi évalué le risque auquel était exposé le demandeur suivant l'article 97 de la Loi, rappelant que ledit article exige que la personne soit personnellement exposée à un risque. Selon la Commission, le risque auquel était exposé le demandeur, le cas échéant, était un risque associé à une violence et à une criminalité généralisées.
Questions en litige
[18]
Le demandeur soulève les questions suivantes devant la Cour:
a. Y a-t-il eu violation de l'équité procédurale?
b. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en tirant des conclusions inappropriées quant à la crédibilité?
c. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte de l'ensemble des éléments de preuve documentaire pertinents propres à la situation du demandeur?
Norme de contrôle
[19]
Les questions d'équité procédurale sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Par ailleurs, les questions touchant l'évaluation par la Commission de la crédibilité et de la preuve sont susceptibles d'un contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité étant donné qu'elles relèvent de son champ d'expertise (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité).
Analyse
[20]
S'agissant de la première question, le demandeur allègue qu'il y a eu violation de l'équité procédurale parce que la Commission ne lui a pas permis de dissiper les doutes qu'elle entretenait au sujet de sa crédibilité en lui demandant de commenter toutes les contradictions dont elle avait constaté l'existence.
[21]
Selon la Cour, il n'y a pas eu violation de l'équité procédurale. En l'espèce, la Commission a indiqué dès le départ que la crédibilité serait en cause (dossier du Tribunal, p. 185). De plus, le demandeur a été interrogé précisément sur bon nombre de conclusions relatives à la crédibilité, par exemple: les événements à l'aéroport (dossier du Tribunal, p. 186 et 187), le fait qu'il n'ait pas déployé d'efforts pour se procurer un rapport sur la fusillade dont son oncle avait été victime ou les comptes rendus des médias relatifs à cet incident (dossier du Tribunal, p. 197), le fait que des hommes masqués se rendent chez lui puis le rencontrent sans masque le lendemain (dossier du Tribunal, p. 207). Même si certaines des contradictions n'ont pas été portées à l'attention du demandeur, il ne s'agit pas en l'espèce d'un problème fondamental et important.
[22]
Le demandeur allègue aussi que les conclusions relatives à sa crédibilité étaient déraisonnables et que, par conséquent, elles justifiaient l'intervention de la Cour. Plus précisément, il soutient que la Commission a tiré des inférences et des conclusions d'invraisemblance non fondées et qu'elle a examiné la preuve à la loupe.
[23]
La Cour souligne que dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 727 (QL), le juge Pinard soulignait au paragraphe 10 qu'il est « légitime pour le tribunal de mettre en doute la véracité d'un récit lorsqu'un demandeur néglige de mentionner des faits importants dans son FRP, mais les ajoute par la suite dans son témoignage oral [...] ». Même s'il faut aborder avec prudence les contradictions entre les notes prises au point d'entrée et le FRP étant donné la façon dont ces notes sont prises, le FRP est rempli plus tard, à un moment où le demandeur peut prendre le temps de mentionner tous les faits pertinents relatifs à sa demande. En l'espèce, le demandeur a omis de mentionner dans son FRP qu'il aurait été détenu à des postes de contrôle de l'armée en 2006. Il y a aussi une contradiction importante entre le contenu du FRP et la lettre de la mère du demandeur présentée à l'audience eu égard à la date à laquelle les membres du CID se seraient rendus au domicile du demandeur pour le retrouver. Il s'agit de faits importants pour l'issue de la demande d'asile et. Compte tenu de cette contradiction, il était loisible à la Commission de mettre en doute la véracité de l'intérêt que le CID aurait démontré à l'égard du demandeur.
[24]
Il était aussi raisonnable que la Commission tire une inférence défavorable du fait que le demandeur n'avait fourni aucune preuve documentaire de la fusillade dont son oncle aurait fait l'objet et des motifs justifiant ladite fusillade. La Cour rappelle que, en vertu de l'article 7 des
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-228, il incombe au demandeur de fournir des documents pour établir les éléments de sa demande. En l'espèce, il n'existe absolument aucune preuve documentaire qui corrobore le décès de l'oncle du demandeur, un événement très important dans sa demande d'asile. Rien ne prouve non plus que le demandeur ait occupé un emploi comme prêtre. Le manque d'efforts déployés pour obtenir des documents aussi importants peut raisonnablement déboucher sur une conclusion défavorable en matière de crédibilité ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 30).
[25]
De plus, la Cour estime que l'inférence d'invraisemblance concernant le fait que des hommes masqués menacent le demandeur puis révèlent leur identité dès le lendemain est logique, raisonnable et fondée adéquatement sur le témoignage du demandeur. Étant donné la déférence qui doit être accordée à la Commission en ce qui concerne les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité et les motifs de la Commission faisant ressortir d'importants problèmes de crédibilité, la Cour n'interviendra pas et elle conclut que l'évaluation de la crédibilité faite par la Commission est raisonnable dans les circonstances.
[26]
S'agissant de la troisième et dernière question, le demandeur allègue que même s'il n'est pas jugé « digne de foi », il pourrait quand même être considéré comme un réfugié (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). S'il est vrai qu'un témoin non crédible pourrait quand même être considéré comme un réfugié lorsque d'autres éléments de la demande le permettent, ce n'est pas le cas en l'espèce. Vu la conclusion quant à l'absence de crédibilité relativement à plusieurs faits importants invoqués par le demandeur (précisément les allégations selon lesquelles des membres du CID et de l'EPSP étaient à l'origine de la fusillade dont son oncle aurait été victime, le CID était à sa recherche et il avait sa résidence dans le nord du pays), il est difficile de conclure qu'il est un réfugié ou une personne à protéger. Il incombe au demandeur de démontrer de quelle façon les risques mentionnés dans les cartables nationaux de documentation le concernent personnellement (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no274 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] ACF no 1079 (QL)). En l'espèce, le seul fait établi à la suite des conclusions défavorables en matière de crédibilité était que le demandeur est un Tamoul de trente et un (31) ans.

Selon le demandeur, la Commission a été trop sélective dans sa façon d'aborder la preuve documentaire, car elle n'a pas tenu compte de renseignements pertinents. La Cour n'est pas d'accord. La Commission a consulté un document récent du UNHCR pour examiner les risques associés au profil du demandeur. La Commission a souligné que la situation au Sri Lanka est encore en évolution, mais elle a souligné plusieurs conclusions faisant état d'une amélioration notable depuis la défaite des Tigres tamouls. Le demandeur fait état d'extraits choisis pour étayer son argument selon lequel la Commission a effectué un examen sélectif de la preuve documentaire. Cependant, les extraits cités par le demandeur ont peu à voir avec sa situation personnelle: le premier concerne les Tamouls de Vanni - affaire dans laquelle le demandeur a déménagé dans le district de Jaffna (dossier du Tribunal, p. 26) - et un déménagement dans la ville de Colombo (rapport danois, dossier du Tribunal, p. 101 et 102). Deux (2) autres extraits concernent précisément les personnes soupçonnées d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET, liens dont l'existence n'a pas été établie en ce qui concerne le demandeur (rapport du UNHCR, dossier du Tribunal, p. 61 à 63; dossier de la demande, p. 189 et 190).

Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la juge Bédard a reconnu que le simple fait d'être un jeune Tamoul du Nord est un critère insuffisant pour statuer qu'un demandeur a besoin de protection ou qu'il est un réfugié au sens de la Convention. La Cour est convaincue que la Commission n'a pas omis de tenir compte des éléments de preuve qui s'opposent directement à ses conclusions (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). En l'absence d'une telle omission, la Commission n'est pas tenue de faire allusion à tous les éléments de preuve qui lui sont présentés.
[29]
La Cour estime que la décision de la Commission est justifiée et qu'elle appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47). L'intervention de la Cour n'est pas justifiée.
