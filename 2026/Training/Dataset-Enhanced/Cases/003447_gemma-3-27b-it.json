    "[0]\nFACTS",
    "[1]\nBlais, J.\n[Translation]: On March 3, 2003, Mr. Mohamed Amine Boubarak (the moving party) filed an application for leave for judicial review. The moving party is represented in this matter by counsel Mr. Jean Baillargeon. He seeks judicial review of a decision by Mr. Michel Jobin of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated February 12, 2003, dismissing the refugee claim of the applicant (the moving party in this proceeding).",
    "[2]\nAccording to rule 10 of the\nFederal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n(\nFCIRPR\n) the application for leave shall be perfected within 30 days after filing the application, which means in this case that the deadline for service and filing was April 2, 2003.",
    "[3]\nThe moving party's counsel sent the applicant's record to the bailiff on April 2, 2003. The bailiff filed it at the Court and served it upon the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the respondent) the following day, April 3, 2003.",
    "[4]\nAlthough it had been filed at the Registry of the Federal Court, the applicant's record was not filed in the applicant's file because it was out of time and the Court had not granted leave to file.",
    "[5]\nOn April 29, 2003, having been informed that there was no record to support the application for leave for judicial review, I made an order to dismiss the application because there was no record.",
    "[6]\nThe moving party's counsel was informed of this order on May 26, 2003. On May 28, 2003, his counsel filed a motion to reconsider under rule 397 of the\nFederal Court Rules, 1998\n(the\nRules\n) to which he attached his own affidavit, alleging the following facts:\n(Translation)\n\"Neither he or the bailiff responsible for the service of the record upon the Court were informed that the Court would not accept the record submitted one day late. He had served the record on the bailiff on April 2, 2003, to be filed the same day. It was not until May 26, 2003 that he was informed of the Court's decision to dismiss the application for leave.\"",
    "[7]\nThis is a motion to reconsider the order dated April 29, 2003.\nSUBMISSIONS BY THE PARTIES\nThe moving party",
    "[8]\nThe moving party is asking the Court to reconsider my decision dated April 29, 2003, dismissing the application for leave for judicial review because there was no record in support of the application.",
    "[9]\nHe alleges that pursuant to rule 397 of the\nRules\n, the Court can reconsider the order of April 29, 2003 because an error was made, i.e. the record was filed on April 3, 2003 when it had been sent on April 2, 2003, which was not the fault of moving party or of his counsel.",
    "[10]\nThere will be serious prejudice to the moving party if he is precluded from filing his memorandum of argument. Further, the record was served in due form a single day late.",
    "[11]\nThe moving party therefore asks the Court to deem that the filing of the record on April 3, 2003 was valid and done within the prescribed time limits.\nThe respondent",
    "[12]\nThe respondent has found a large number of faults in the motion filed that taint the motion and make it inadmissible.",
    "[13]\nNeither rule 397, cited by the applicant, nor rule 399 for that matter can be used as a basis for this motion. Rule 397 allows it to be reconsidered but under very limited conditions: either that the order does not accord with any reasons given for it, or that a matter that should have been dealt with has been overlooked. Further, rule 397 requires that the motion to reconsider be presented within 10 days after the making of the disputed order, unless the Court has given leave to extend this period.",
    "[14]\nAs for rule 399, it does not apply either because this does not involve a motion decided ex parte, or a decision made in the absence of the parties for the reasons provided in rule 399. Further, there is no fraud or a new matter that arose subsequent to the making of the order.",
    "[15]\nMoreover, the respondent argues that the affidavit filed in support of the motion must be struck in its entirety pursuant to rule 82 of the Rules. This rule provides that a solicitor cannot both depose to an affidavit and present argument to the Court based on that affidavit. If the affidavit is struck, the motion must be dismissed for substantive defect.",
    "[16]\nFinally, the motion does not explain why the request for extension of time was not made before May 26, 2003, despite the fact that the solicitor knew or ought to have known by April 3, 2003, that his record had been filed late.\nISSUES",
    "[17]\nCan the decision made on April 29, 2003, be set aside, and can the Court grant leave for the service and filing of the application record outside the time limit?\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS\nFederal Court Rules, 1998\n\"\nGeneral principle\n\"3.

    "[18]\nThis motion is inadmissible because the Court would be exceeding its jurisdiction in granting it. It is never easy to make such a decision, because it forces us to confront the rationale of the\nRules\n, which are supposed to serve justice and the litigant's right to fairness. In the case before us, an applicant loses the opportunity to make an application for judicial review to the Court. He is deprived of a right because of his counsel's lack of diligence.",
    "[19]\nThe\nRules\nexist so that the system can function. They provide a certain latitude. It happens that a deadline is missed, that a document is not filed, that an application is not in the perfect format. The Court certainly has the power to forgive human error in order to ensure that the\nRules\ndo not hinder the fair and equitable resolution of the problems before it. But the Court cannot do the impossible. It cannot deviate from the\nRules\nto the point that they lose their meaning. The gravity of the errors made in this case tip the balance, in the end. Let us first see why the application is inadmissible and then we will briefly address the issue of fairness.",
    "[20]\nAn initial error was made when the record was not served and filed within 30 days after the filing of the application for leave pursuant to rule 10 of the\nFCIRPR\n. The moving party's counsel knew that the application had to be perfected on April 2, 2003. He gave the record to a bailiff on April 2, 2003, to file and to serve on the respondent. The record was not served and filed until April 3, 2003.",
    "[21]\nCounsel knew or ought to have known that the record was one day late as of April 3, 2003, when he received proof of service from the bailiff. Even so - second error - he did not attempt to apply for an extension of time so that the record would be accepted. Yet, rule 21 of the\nFCIRPR\nis clear: without the leave of a judge or prothonotary of the Court the time limit cannot be extended.",
    "[22]\nThird error: he was not concerned about what happened to the record - was it allowed by the Court or not? The Court was called upon to make a decision on the application for leave on April 29, 2003. Without a record, the application for leave was dismissed.",
    "[23]\nWhen the moving party's counsel learned, on May 26, 2003, of the existence of the order dismissing the application for leave, he then acted diligently and promptly: a motion to reconsider was filed at Court on May 28, 2003.",
    "[24]\nUnfortunately, the errors continued. In support of his motion, counsel deposed his own affidavit, thereby contravening rule 82 of the\nRules\n. Rule 82 provides that we can make an exception for him, but only with leave of the Court. Counsel did not apply for this leave.",
    "[25]\nCounsel relies on rule 397 of the\nRules\nas a means to have the order of April 29, 2003, set aside. This rule provides that a motion to reconsider be made within ten days after the order; once again, the time limit can be extended only with the Court's leave. Rule 397, as drafted and interpreted in the caselaw, is quite limited in scope. Counsel does not indicate in his memorandum how it must apply in this case.",
    "[26]\nFinally, counsel does not indicate how the criteria developed in the caselaw to justify an extension of time should be applied to the moving party.",
    "[27]\nThe moving party relies on rule 397, simply alleging that there was an error. However, the error contemplated by rule 397 is to be understood in the sense of an error that inadvertently shows up in the drafting process. Filing the record one day late is not an error, but a default. Rule 397 is not meant to be used to remedy the default of a party.",
    "[28]\nParagraph 397(1)(b) does not help the moving party, either. This provision provides that reconsideration is possible when a matter that should have been dealt with has been overlooked or accidentally omitted. In\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 116 F.T.R. 29 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Noël held that because he was not informed about a document sent to the Registry (a letter in which the respondent's counsel indicated his intention to reply to the notice of motion) he could reopen a decision that he had made on the extension of a time limit.",
    "[29]\nIn this case, the Court was not informed that the record had arrived a day late. This piece of information could have affected the decision. However, the reason why this information was not brought to the Court's attention in the time required was, once again, the lack of diligence of counsel for the moving party in ensuring that the Court had the information necessary for its decision. If a request for extension of time had been made, the Court would have been seized of it when it made the order dated April 29, 2003.",
    "[30]\nRule 397 is not meant to bring an item of information to the judge's attention that counsel forgot at the time of the hearing. It is intended, rather, for situations in which the judge, for whatever reason, does not consider an important factor at the time he makes his decision when this factor was already in the record -\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 112 N.R. 318 (F.C.A.):\n\"In my opinion, the failure of a party to include available material does not give rise to jurisdiction to reconsider a decision finally disposing of a matter. That rule contemplates oversight on the part of the Court, not a party, (...)\"",
    "[31]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 77 F.T.R. 296 (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay dismissed the request for extension of time presented after the order dismissing the application for judicial review because there was not a satisfactory explanation for the moving party's delay in requesting the extension of time. In determining the matter, MacKay, J., did not have the information that could justify the extension. Rule 337 at that time, now rule 397, did not allow him to grant the extension after the fact. I believe that this reasoning applies in this case as well.",
    "[32]\nIn his decision, MacKay, J., refers to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  had dismissed an application for an extension of the time limit to file the record in support of an application for leave for judicial review for the simple reason that the request for extension was made after the application for leave had been dismissed.",
    "[33]\nThe other rule that provides for setting aside a decision is rule 399, but here again the rule is difficult to apply in the circumstances of this case. This is not an ex parte motion, this is not a case where the party did not appear because a notice was not issued, or a case of fraud or a matter that arose subsequent to the making of the order. The fact that the Court was informed after the fact that the record was one day late does not amount to a \"new matter that arose\". Again, it was known at the time of the judgment of April 29, 2003 and it was not brought to the Court's attention because of counsel's carelessness.",
    "[34]\nI do not think it is necessary to address the issue raised by the affidavit in order to make a decision on the motion. We need simply recall rule 82 which states quite clearly that \"[e]xcept with leave of the Court, a solicitor shall not both depose to an affidavit and present argument to the Court based on that affidavit.\"  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 216 F.T.R. 218 (T.D.), I had occasion to address the problem of the affidavit of a solicitor in the proceedings. The rule exists and there must be solid grounds to deviate from it. None have been advanced here.",
    "[35]\nThe moving party's attempt to have the decision of April 29, 2003, reconsidered must fail because the motion to reconsider simply does not fall within the powers of the Court. The Court does not have jurisdiction to decide on the motion to reconsider because there is no rule or section that gives it jurisdiction to do so. The Rules cannot be used to correct a failure to respect the deadlines. The decision of April 29, 2003 was based on the facts - or rather the absence of facts. All the moving party had to do at that point was to come before the Court with a request for extension of time.",
    "[36]\nFurthermore, if the matter is looked at from the perspective of a request for extension of time, we should remember the criteria set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 244 N.R. 399 (F.C.A.), to determine if a moving party should be entitled to an extension of time:\n\" [3] The proper test is whether the applicant has demonstrated\n1. a continuing intention to pursue his or her application;\n2. that the application has some merit;\n3. that no prejudice to the respondent arises from the delay; and\n4. that a reasonable explanation for the delay exists.\n\" [4] Any determination of whether or not the applicant's explanation justifies the granting of the necessary extension of time will turn on the facts of each particular case.\"",
    "[37]\nIn this case, we cannot say that there is a reasonable explanation that justifies the delay. The moving party's counsel knew, or ought to have known, that the record had been filed one day late. Rather than taking the initiative and requesting an extension of time, he hopes against hope that the record will be accepted despite everything. This is what his affidavit suggests - neither the bailiff nor counsel nor the moving party received any indication from the Court that the record had not been accepted. But it was counsel's responsibility to ensure that the file was in order. He did not do so.",
    "[38]\nA final order was made on April 29, 2003, that dismissed the application for leave for judicial review. I cannot see anything in the\nRules\nor in the facts that would allow me to vary this order.",
    "[39]\nThe result is unfortunate. Because counsel failed to respect the time limits and procedure, the moving party is deprived of recourse. Waldman in\nImmigration Law and Practice\n(Buttersworth Canada 1992, incl. Service Issues 1993-2003) foresees this possibility and warns counsel and applicants:\n\"11.88 It is essential that counsel apply for an extension of time to file the record before the expiry of the prescribed time period. Otherwise, the court may well proceed without the supporting material and the application could be dismissed. Once the application is dismissed, the court would not have the jurisdiction to extend the time as the matter would have been finally disposed of.\n\"11.89 Counsel should be cognizant of the serious consequences that will befall an applicant if the application is not perfected within the time prescribed by the rules. As noted above, the\nFederal Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\nprovide that, if a party fails to comply with any of the time limits prescribed, the Court may, without further notice, dispose of the application. If no material is filed in support of an application for leave, then the court would have no alternative but to dismiss the application. This could lead to serious consequences of the applicant and to his or her counsel.\"",
    "[40]\nThere is still the issue of equity for the moving party. Should he be punished for his counsel's incompetence? I do not believe I have to resolve this problem in the context of this application, the outcome of which is clear. I believe, however, that it is important to say a few words about what is at stake when recourse is lost because of counsel's carelessness.",
    "[41]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 69 F.T.R. 77 (T.D.), Madam Justice Reed writes at paragraph 10:\n\"Counsel and client for such purposes are one. It is too easy a justification for non-compliance with the rules for counsel to say the delay was not in any way caused by my client and if an extension is not granted my client will be prejudiced.\"",
    "[42]\nIn this case, Reed, J., refused to grant an extension of time to file a record in support of an application for leave because she found that the counsel's reason was frivolous.",
    "[43]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 28 F.T.R. 217 (T.D.), however, Pinard, J., addressed the protection conferred by section 7 of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\nto those claiming refugee status - protection recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[44]\nIn the words of Dickson, J., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 161, likening the principal of fundamental justice to \"the basic tenets and principles, not only of our judicial process, but also of the other components of our legal system\" (page 513), Pinard, J., adds:\n\"I consider that 'the basic tenets and principles ... of our judicial process ... [and] of the other components of our legal systems' include, for someone claiming refugee status under the\nImmigration Act, 1976\n, the right to be represented by competent and careful counsel, if he so desires, and the right to a full and complete hearing.\"",
    "[45]\nThe moving party may have other recourse available to him. In this motion, however, for the reasons given above, the Court does not have jurisdiction to vary the order dated April 29, 2003.",
    "[46]\nConsequently, the applicant has not satisfied me of the merits of his motion.\nORDER",

Without a record, the application for leave was dismissed.\n[23]\nWhen the moving party's counsel learned, on May 26, 2003, of the existence of the order dismissing the application for leave, he then acted diligently and promptly: a motion to reconsider was filed at Court on May 28, 2003.\n[24]\nUnfortunately, the errors continued. In support of his motion, counsel deposed his own affidavit, thereby contravening rule 82 of the\nRules\n. Rule 82 provides that we can make an exception for him, but only with leave of the Court. Counsel did not apply for this leave.\n[25]\nCounsel relies on rule 397 of the\nRules\nas a means to have the order of April 29, 2003, set aside. This rule provides that a motion to reconsider be made within ten days after the order; once again, the time limit can be extended only with the Court's leave. Rule 397, as drafted and interpreted in the caselaw, is quite limited in scope. Counsel does not indicate in his memorandum how it must apply in this case.\n[26]\nFinally, counsel does not indicate how the criteria developed in the caselaw to justify an extension of time should be applied to the moving party.\n[27]\nThe moving party relies on rule 397, simply alleging that there was an error. However, the error contemplated by rule 397 is to be understood in the sense of an error that inadvertently shows up in the drafting process. Filing the record one day late is not an error, but a default. Rule 397 is not meant to be used to remedy the default of a party.\n[28]\nParagraph 397(1)(b) does not help the moving party, either. This provision provides that reconsideration is possible when a matter that should have been dealt with has been overlooked or accidentally omitted. In\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 116 F.T.R. 29 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Noël held that because he was not informed about a document sent to the Registry (a letter in which the respondent's counsel indicated his intention to reply to the notice of motion) he could reopen a decision that he had made on the extension of a time limit.\n[29]\nIn this case, the Court was not informed that the record had arrived a day late. This piece of information could have affected the decision. However, the reason why this information was not brought to the Court's attention in the time required was, once again, the lack of diligence of counsel for the moving party in ensuring that the Court had the information necessary for its decision. If a request for extension of time had been made, the Court would have been seized of it when it made the order dated April 29, 2003.\n[30]\nRule 397 is not meant to bring an item of information to the judge's attention that counsel forgot at the time of the hearing. It is intended, rather, for situations in which the judge, for whatever reason, does not consider an important factor at the time he makes his decision when this factor was already in the record -\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 112 N.R. 318 (F.C.A.):\n\"In my opinion, the failure of a party to include available material does not give rise to jurisdiction to reconsider a decision finally disposing of a matter. That rule contemplates oversight on the part of the Court, not a party, (...)\"\n[31]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 77 F.T.R. 296 (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay dismissed the request for extension of time presented after the order dismissing the application for judicial review because there was not a satisfactory explanation for the moving party's delay in requesting the extension of time. In determining the matter, MacKay, J., did not have the information that could justify the extension. Rule 337 at that time, now rule 397, did not allow him to grant the extension after the fact. I believe that this reasoning applies in this case as well.\n[32]\nIn his decision, MacKay, J., refers to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  had dismissed an application for an extension of the time limit to file the record in support of an application for leave for judicial review for the simple reason that the request for extension was made after the application for leave had been dismissed.\n[33]\nThe other rule that provides for setting aside a decision is rule 399, but here again the rule is difficult to apply in the circumstances of this case. This is not an ex parte motion, this is not a case where the party did not appear because a notice was not issued, or a case of fraud or a matter that arose subsequent to the making of the order. The fact that the Court was informed after the fact that the record was one day late does not amount to a \"new matter that arose\". Again, it was known at the time of the judgment of April 29, 2003 and it was not brought to the Court's attention because of counsel's carelessness.\n[34]\nI do not think it is necessary to address the issue raised by the affidavit in order to make a decision on the motion. We need simply recall rule 82 which states quite clearly that \"[e]xcept with leave of the Court, a solicitor shall not both depose to an affidavit and present argument to the Court based on that affidavit.\"  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 216 F.T.R. 218 (T.D.), I had occasion to address the problem of the affidavit of a solicitor in the proceedings. The rule exists and there must be solid grounds to deviate from it. None have been advanced here.\n[35]\nThe moving party's attempt to have the decision of April 29, 2003, reconsidered must fail because the motion to reconsider simply does not fall within the powers of the Court. The Court does not have jurisdiction to decide on the motion to reconsider because there is no rule or section that gives it jurisdiction to do so. The Rules cannot be used to correct a failure to respect the deadlines. The decision of April 29, 2003 was based on the facts - or rather the absence of facts. All the moving party had to do at that point was to come before the Court with a request for extension of time.\n[36]\nFurthermore, if the matter is looked at from the perspective of a request for extension of time, we should remember the criteria set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 244 N.R. 399 (F.C.A.), to determine if a moving party should be entitled to an extension of time:\n\"[3] The proper test is whether the applicant has demonstrated\n1. a continuing intention to pursue his or her application;\n2. that the application has some merit;\n3. that no prejudice to the respondent arises from the delay; and\n4. that a reasonable explanation for the delay exists.\n\"[4] Any determination of whether or not the applicant's explanation justifies the granting of the necessary extension of time will turn on the facts of each particular case.\"\n[37]\nIn this case, we cannot say that there is a reasonable explanation that justifies the delay. The moving party's counsel knew, or ought to have known, that the record had been filed one day late. Rather than taking the initiative and requesting an extension of time, he hopes against hope that the record will be accepted despite everything. This is what his affidavit suggests - neither the bailiff nor counsel nor the moving party received any indication from the Court that the record had not been accepted. But it was counsel's responsibility to ensure that the file was in order. He did not do so.\n[38]\nA final order was made on April 29, 2003, that dismissed the application for leave for judicial review. I cannot see anything in the\nRules\nor in the facts that would allow me to vary this order.\n[39]\nThe result is unfortunate. Because counsel failed to respect the time limits and procedure, the moving party is deprived of recourse. Waldman in\nImmigration Law and Practice\n(Buttersworth Canada 1992, incl. Service Issues 1993-2003) foresees this possibility and warns counsel and applicants:\n\"11.88 It is essential that counsel apply for an extension of time to file the record before the expiry of the prescribed time period. Otherwise, the court may well proceed without the supporting material and the application could be dismissed. Once the application is dismissed, the court would not have the jurisdiction to extend the time as the matter would have been finally disposed of.\n\"11.89 Counsel should be cognizant of the serious consequences that will befall an applicant if the application is not perfected within the time prescribed by the rules. As noted above, the\nFederal Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\nprovide that, if a party fails to comply with any of the time limits prescribed, the Court may, without further notice, dispose of the application. If no material is filed in support of an application for leave, then the court would have no alternative but to dismiss the application. This could lead to serious consequences of the applicant and to his or her counsel.\"\n[40]\nThere is still the issue of equity for the moving party. Should he be punished for his counsel's incompetence? I do not believe I have to resolve this problem in the context of this application, the outcome of which is clear. I believe, however, that it is important to say a few words about what is at stake when recourse is lost because of counsel's carelessness.\n[41]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 69 F.T.R. 77 (T.D.), Madam Justice Reed writes at paragraph 10:\n\"Counsel and client for such purposes are one. It is too easy a justification for non-compliance with the rules for counsel to say the delay was not in any way caused by my client and if an extension is not granted my client will be prejudiced.\"\n[42]\nIn this case, Reed, J., refused to grant an extension of time to file a record in support of an application for leave because she found that the counsel's reason was frivolous.\n[43]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 28 F.T.R. 217 (T.D.), however, Pinard, J., addressed the protection conferred by section 7 of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\nto those claiming refugee status - protection recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[44]\nIn the words of Dickson, J., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 161, likening the principal of fundamental justice to \"the basic tenets and principles, not only of our judicial process, but also of the other components of our legal system\" (page 513), Pinard, J., adds:\n\"I consider that 'the basic tenets and principles ... of our judicial process ...

In this motion, however, for the reasons given above, the Court does not have jurisdiction to vary the order dated April 29, 2003.\n[46]\nConsequently, the applicant has not satisfied me of the merits of his motion.\nORDER\n[47]\nTHE COURT ORDERS THAT:\n- This motion to reconsider be dismissed;\n- The whole without costs.\nMotion dismissed.\nEditor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/djc",
  "full_text_en": "[0]\nFACTS\n\n[1]\nBlais, J.\n[Translation]: On March 3, 2003, Mr. Mohamed Amine Boubarak (the moving party) filed an application for leave for judicial review. The moving party is represented in this matter by counsel Mr. Jean Baillargeon. He seeks judicial review of a decision by Mr. Michel Jobin of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated February 12, 2003, dismissing the refugee claim of the applicant (the moving party in this proceeding).\n\n[2]\nAccording to rule 10 of the\nFederal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n(\nFCIRPR\n) the application for leave shall be perfected within 30 days after filing the application, which means in this case that the deadline for service and filing was April 2, 2003.\n\n[3]\nThe moving party's counsel sent the applicant's record to the bailiff on April 2, 2003. The bailiff filed it at the Court and served it upon the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the respondent) the following day, April 3, 2003.\n\n[4]\nAlthough it had been filed at the Registry of the Federal Court, the applicant's record was not filed in the applicant's file because it was out of time and the Court had not granted leave to file.\n\n[5]\nOn April 29, 2003, having been informed that there was no record to support the application for leave for judicial review, I made an order to dismiss the application because there was no record.\n\n[6]\nThe moving party's counsel was informed of this order on May 26, 2003. On May 28, 2003, his counsel filed a motion to reconsider under rule 397 of the\nFederal Court Rules, 1998\n(the\nRules\n) to which he attached his own affidavit, alleging the following facts:\n(Translation)\n\"Neither he or the bailiff responsible for the service of the record upon the Court were informed that the Court would not accept the record submitted one day late. He had served the record on the bailiff on April 2, 2003, to be filed the same day. It was not until May 26, 2003 that he was informed of the Court's decision to dismiss the application for leave.\"\n\n[7]\nThis is a motion to reconsider the order dated April 29, 2003.\nSUBMISSIONS BY THE PARTIES\nThe moving party\n\n[8]\nThe moving party is asking the Court to reconsider my decision dated April 29, 2003, dismissing the application for leave for judicial review because there was no record in support of the application.\n\n[9]\nHe alleges that pursuant to rule 397 of the\nRules\n, the Court can reconsider the order of April 29, 2003 because an error was made, i.e. the record was filed on April 3, 2003 when it had been sent on April 2, 2003, which was not the fault of moving party or of his counsel.\n\n[10]\nThere will be serious prejudice to the moving party if he is precluded from filing his memorandum of argument. Further, the record was served in due form a single day late.\n\n[11]\nThe moving party therefore asks the Court to deem that the filing of the record on April 3, 2003 was valid and done within the prescribed time limits.\nThe respondent\n\n[12]\nThe respondent has found a large number of faults in the motion filed that taint the motion and make it inadmissible.\n\n[13]\nNeither rule 397, cited by the applicant, nor rule 399 for that matter can be used as a basis for this motion. Rule 397 allows it to be reconsidered but under very limited conditions: either that the order does not accord with any reasons given for it, or that a matter that should have been dealt with has been overlooked. Further, rule 397 requires that the motion to reconsider be presented within 10 days after the making of the disputed order, unless the Court has given leave to extend this period.\n\n[14]\nAs for rule 399, it does not apply either because this does not involve a motion decided ex parte, or a decision made in the absence of the parties for the reasons provided in rule 399. Further, there is no fraud or a new matter that arose subsequent to the making of the order.\n\n[15]\nMoreover, the respondent argues that the affidavit filed in support of the motion must be struck in its entirety pursuant to rule 82 of the Rules. This rule provides that a solicitor cannot both depose to an affidavit and present argument to the Court based on that affidavit. If the affidavit is struck, the motion must be dismissed for substantive defect.\n\n[16]\nFinally, the motion does not explain why the request for extension of time was not made before May 26, 2003, despite the fact that the solicitor knew or ought to have known by April 3, 2003, that his record had been filed late.\nISSUES\n\n[17]\nCan the decision made on April 29, 2003, be set aside, and can the Court grant leave for the service and filing of the application record outside the time limit?\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS\nFederal Court Rules, 1998\n\"\nGeneral principle\n\"3.

It is never easy to make such a decision, because it forces us to confront the rationale of the\nRules\n, which are supposed to serve justice and the litigant's right to fairness. In the case before us, an applicant loses the opportunity to make an application for judicial review to the Court. He is deprived of a right because of his counsel's lack of diligence.\n\n[19]\nThe\nRules\nexist so that the system can function. They provide a certain latitude. It happens that a deadline is missed, that a document is not filed, that an application is not in the perfect format. The Court certainly has the power to forgive human error in order to ensure that the\nRules\ndo not hinder the fair and equitable resolution of the problems before it. But the Court cannot do the impossible. It cannot deviate from the\nRules\nto the point that they lose their meaning. The gravity of the errors made in this case tip the balance, in the end. Let us first see why the application is inadmissible and then we will briefly address the issue of fairness.\n\n[20]\nAn initial error was made when the record was not served and filed within 30 days after the filing of the application for leave pursuant to rule 10 of the\nFCIRPR\n. The moving party's counsel knew that the application had to be perfected on April 2, 2003. He gave the record to a bailiff on April 2, 2003, to file and to serve on the respondent. The record was not served and filed until April 3, 2003.\n\n[21]\nCounsel knew or ought to have known that the record was one day late as of April 3, 2003, when he received proof of service from the bailiff. Even so - second error - he did not attempt to apply for an extension of time so that the record would be accepted. Yet, rule 21 of the\nFCIRPR\nis clear: without the leave of a judge or prothonotary of the Court the time limit cannot be extended.\n\n[22]\nThird error: he was not concerned about what happened to the record - was it allowed by the Court or not? The Court was called upon to make a decision on the application for leave on April 29, 2003. Without a record, the application for leave was dismissed.\n\n[23]\nWhen the moving party's counsel learned, on May 26, 2003, of the existence of the order dismissing the application for leave, he then acted diligently and promptly: a motion to reconsider was filed at Court on May 28, 2003.\n\n[24]\nUnfortunately, the errors continued. In support of his motion, counsel deposed his own affidavit, thereby contravening rule 82 of the\nRules\n. Rule 82 provides that we can make an exception for him, but only with leave of the Court. Counsel did not apply for this leave.\n\n[25]\nCounsel relies on rule 397 of the\nRules\nas a means to have the order of April 29, 2003, set aside. This rule provides that a motion to reconsider be made within ten days after the order; once again, the time limit can be extended only with the Court's leave. Rule 397, as drafted and interpreted in the caselaw, is quite limited in scope. Counsel does not indicate in his memorandum how it must apply in this case.\n\n[26]\nFinally, counsel does not indicate how the criteria developed in the caselaw to justify an extension of time should be applied to the moving party.\n\n[27]\nThe moving party relies on rule 397, simply alleging that there was an error. However, the error contemplated by rule 397 is to be understood in the sense of an error that inadvertently shows up in the drafting process. Filing the record one day late is not an error, but a default. Rule 397 is not meant to be used to remedy the default of a party.\n\n[28]\nParagraph 397(1)(b) does not help the moving party, either. This provision provides that reconsideration is possible when a matter that should have been dealt with has been overlooked or accidentally omitted. In\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 116 F.T.R. 29 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Noël held that because he was not informed about a document sent to the Registry (a letter in which the respondent's counsel indicated his intention to reply to the notice of motion) he could reopen a decision that he had made on the extension of a time limit.\n\n[29]\nIn this case, the Court was not informed that the record had arrived a day late.

In this motion, however, for the reasons given above, the Court does not have jurisdiction to vary the order dated April 29, 2003.\n\n[46]\nConsequently, the applicant has not satisfied me of the merits of his motion.\nORDER\n\n[47]\nTHE COURT ORDERS THAT:\n- This motion to reconsider be dismissed;\n- The whole without costs.\nMotion dismissed.\nEditor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/djc",

      "Applicants": [
        "The Court should reconsider the April 29, 2003 decision dismissing the application for judicial review because the record was filed on April 3, 2003, only one day late.",
        "The delay in filing was not the fault of the applicant or their counsel.",
        "Prejudice will result if the applicant is prevented from filing their memorandum of argument.",

      "Respondents": [
        "Neither Rule 397 nor Rule 399 of the Federal Court Rules provide a basis for the motion.",
        "The motion to reconsider was not filed within the 10-day time limit prescribed by Rule 397, and no leave was sought to extend this period.",
        "Rule 399 does not apply as the motion is not ex parte, nor is it based on fraud or new matters arising after the order.",
        "The affidavit filed in support of the motion should be struck in its entirety under Rule 82 of the Federal Court Rules because counsel both deposed to the affidavit and is presenting argument based on it.",
        "The applicant failed to request an extension of time before May 26, 2003, despite knowing the record was filed late.",
        "The 'error' alleged by the applicant is a default, not an error contemplated by Rule 397.",
        "The applicant's explanation for the delay is not reasonable."

    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The court found the motion to reconsider inadmissible because the applicant failed to meet procedural deadlines and the court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief. The core issue was the late filing of the application record, which occurred one day after the 30-day limit prescribed by rule 10 of the Federal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules (FCIRPR).",
      "The court emphasized the importance of adhering to the Rules to maintain the functioning of the legal system, acknowledging that while some flexibility exists for human error, it cannot be extended to the point of undermining the Rules' meaning. The court distinguished between a simple error and a default, categorizing the late filing as the latter.",
      "The court rejected the applicant’s reliance on rule 397 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998, finding that it did not apply because the alleged 'error' was a failure to meet a deadline, not an error in the order itself. The court clarified that rule 397 is intended to address errors in drafting or oversight by the *court*, not failures by a party to comply with deadlines.",
      "The court referenced caselaw ( *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, *116 F.T.R. 29 (T.D.)*; *112 N.R. 318 (F.C.A.)*) to support its interpretation of rule 397, stating it’s meant for situations where the court overlooked a relevant factor, not to remedy a party’s default.",
      "The court also dismissed the applicant’s arguments under rule 399, finding that the situation did not involve an ex parte order, absence of a party, fraud, or a new matter arising after the order. The late filing was known at the time of the decision and not a subsequent development.",
      "The court noted a procedural error in the applicant’s motion: counsel deposed an affidavit and then argued based on it, violating rule 82 of the Rules, which prohibits a solicitor from both roles without leave of court (which was not sought).",
      "The court considered, but ultimately did not need to rule on, the issue of fairness and potential prejudice to the applicant due to counsel’s negligence. However, it cited caselaw (*69 F.T.R. 77 (T.D.)*) establishing that counsel and client are considered one for purposes of compliance with rules, and that negligence of counsel is generally not a valid excuse for delay.",
      "The court referenced the test for granting extensions of time established in *244 N.R. 399 (F.C.A.)* (continuing intention to pursue, merit of the application, no prejudice to the respondent, and a reasonable explanation for the delay) and found that the applicant had not provided a reasonable explanation for the delay.",
      "The court concluded that it lacked the jurisdiction to vary the original order dismissing the application for leave, as the applicant had not requested an extension of time and the Rules do not allow for retroactive correction of a failure to meet deadlines. The court emphasized that the applicant’s recourse was to request an extension *before* the application was dismissed."

    "final_outcome": [
      "The motion to reconsider was dismissed.",
