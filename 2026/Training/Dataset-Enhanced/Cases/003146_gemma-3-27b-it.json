    "[1] McKeown, J.\n: The issue is whether the Board erred in not providing the applicant with a proper opportunity to present his evidence on the past persecution and in not determining whether there was a well founded fear of past persecution.",
    "[2]\nIn my view the Board did not provide the applicant with a full and fair hearing of his claim. I am in sympathy with the Board in trying to limit the amount of time applicable to any matter before it, but the Board must observe the principles of natural justice. The Board continually and repeatedly prevented the applicant from presenting his evidence relevant to persecution prior to 1990 in an organized fashion. Counsel was prepared to accede to this request if the Board agreed there was past persecution. The Board stated it accepted what was in the PIF of the applicant but refused to inform the applicant's counsel whether, in the members view, it constituted past persecution. Furthermore the Board reached no conclusion on whether there was past persecution in its decision. While I agree that the primary question in this matter is whether there was a well founded fear of future persecution, this cannot be decided in the matter before me without determining if there was past persecution.",
    "[3]\nIn this case the definition of Convention refugee in s. 2 is important and ss. 2(2)(e) and 2(3). The Board has ignored s. 2(3).",
    "[4]\nAs Noel, J., stated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Authorities:\n\"The other issue with which the Board was confronted with was whether the applicant could have a well-founded fear of persecution as a result of his encounter with the L.T.T.E. The Board, in my view, failed to deal with this issue all together. The Board states in its reasons that the L.T.T.E. was harassing the claimant to deter him from becoming an informer. The issue, then, was whether these acts of harassments, taken cumulatively, constituted persecution, and whether the applicant had a reasonable prospective fear of persecution by reason of these acts. These questions were simply ignored.\"\nIt is not good enough for the Board to list a series of facts in their decision without determining whether the acts taken cumulatively constituted persecution and whether the applicant had a reasonable prospective fear of persecution by reason of these previous acts. Notwithstanding changed circumstances in Bulgaria, the facts prior to 1990 should not have been restricted to those set out in the PIF but should also include the relevant ones from the oral evidence. On the circumstances of this case there is reason to be concerned that the Board did not consider these other facts. It is also no answer to say that the Board allowed the applicant to put into evidence all evidence relating to past persecution when it is clear from the transcript that the Board members were not interested, constantly interrupted and prevented counsel from proceeding in an orderly fashion.",
    "[5]\nAlthough it is not necessary to this decision, the Board has misstated and ignored evidence relating to the implausibility of the two matters related by the applicant and dealt with at pp. 9 and 10 of its reasons. In particular the Board has ignored evidence that the UDF was not even founded at the time of the first physical attack and the Trade Union may have been formed only on the same day. There is documentary evidence which indicates the limited effectiveness of these two organizations which should be weighted by the Board. Furthermore the applicant's problems arose with the KDC, the State Security Police and not the local police.",
    "[6]\nThe application is granted. The decision of the board dated January 6, 1992 is set aside and this matter is referred back to the Immigration and Refugee Board for redetermination by a differently constituted panel in accordance with the reasons herein.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Angela E.

      "The court emphasized the importance of sections 2(2)(e) and 2(3) of the relevant statute (s. 2 defining 'Convention refugee') and found the Board had ignored s. 2(3) in its analysis.",
      "The court agreed with a previous judgment (Noel, J.) that the Board failed to adequately address whether harassment by the L.T.T.E. constituted persecution and whether the applicant had a reasonable fear of future persecution based on those acts, simply listing facts without making a determination.",
      "The court determined that even if the Board allowed all evidence of past persecution to be submitted, the members’ disinterest and constant interruptions effectively prevented a proper presentation and consideration of that evidence.",
      "The court noted, though not essential to the decision, that the Board misstated and ignored evidence regarding the plausibility of certain events, specifically pointing to documentary evidence contradicting the Board’s assessment of the timing and effectiveness of the UDF and the Trade Union, and misidentifying the source of the applicant’s problems as local police rather than State Security Police."
