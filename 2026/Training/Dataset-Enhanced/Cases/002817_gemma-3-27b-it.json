    "[1]\nAnnis, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated October 23, 2012, which found that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBackground",
    "[2]\nThe applicant is a Turkish citizen of Kurdish ethnicity, born in 1979. He turned 19 in 1998 and normally should have started his compulsory military service, but obtained a three-year deferment of military service to finish his studies. In order to do so, he had to sign an agreement to the effect that he would complete his service after his studies. He did not raise his conscientious objection, fearing that he might be perceived as a terrorist.",
    "[3]\nIn 2000 the end of his deferment was approaching, but he believed in non-violence and did not want to serve or fight against his people. His father therefore helped him leave Turkey on a student visa and join an older brother in Switzerland. He attended a language school, but this could not count as university studies for the purpose of obtaining an extension of the deferment. The deferment expired in 2001. His Turkish passport expired in 2006. He obtained a diploma in French in 2007. He then remained in Switzerland without status because it was impossible for him to seek asylum in that country without being deported to Turkey. In 2011, he took his brother's passport and left for Canada. He claimed refugee protection on the basis of his nationality, race, and on the fact that he is a conscientious objector.\nImpugned decision",
    "[4]\nThe panel determined that there was not a serious possibility that the applicant would be persecuted on the basis of his race and nationality. There is no absolute or partial right to conscientious objector status and the fear of prosecution for refusing to submit to compulsory military service does not constitute a well-founded fear of persecution as per the definition of refugee. The applicant has not established that he would face a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, were he to return to Turkey.",
    "[5]\nThe panel noted that the Federal Court restricted the definition of conscientious objection in cases where refugee claimants refuse to participate in any military actions. This applicant had not demonstrated any deep religious or philosophical beliefs that led him to object to military service, or that he belonged to an organization of conscientious objectors. He did not tell military authorities that he refused to serve; he never publicly opposed military service or war, and he benefitted from a law of general application that allowed him to defer his service until after he had completed his studies. He failed to show that, if he were convicted of draft-evasion or desertion, he would be subject to additional punishment due to his status as a conscientious objector. The possibility of receiving a maximum three-year sentence does not constitute persecution in the absence of aggravating circumstances.",
    "[6]\nThe panel rejected the refugee claim.\nIssues",
    "[7]\nThe issues are the following:\na. Was it reasonable for the panel to conclude that the applicant was not a conscientious objector?\nb. Was it reasonable for the panel to conclude that the penalties for evasion of military service that is compulsory under a law of general application do not constitute persecution?\nStandard of Review",
    "[8]\nBoth issues are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (see for example\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nAnalysis\n1. Was it reasonable for the panel to conclude that the applicant was not a conscientious objector?",
    "[9]\nIn this case, the applicant is seeking to avail himself of the third exception in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [14] Thus, an applicant generally cannot claim refugee status under the\nUnited Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n(the Convention) - and accordingly, under s. 96 of the IRPA, just because he does not want to serve in his country's army. According to Hathaway, however, there are three exceptions to the general rule above. ... The third and final exception applies to those with \"principled objections\" to military service, more widely known as \"conscientious objectors\".",
    "[10]\nThe applicant submitted that the RPD failed to examine the possibility of persecution on the basis of his Kurdish origin, arriving at its conclusion without having analyzed this point. I find that the applicant never claimed that he was persecuted because of the fact that he was Kurdish - either in his written narrative, or in his testimony at the hearing. As a result, the panel did not need to dispose of that ground.",
    "[11]\nThe applicant further argued that the RPD did not question him about his religious beliefs during the hearing and that his allegations on this point were not contradicted.",
    "[12]\nGiven the oral and documentary evidence, the Board reasonably concluded that the applicant is not a conscientious objector. Its reasoning is based on the following:\na. The applicant did not belong to an organization of conscientious objectors;\nb. When the applicant was first called up for compulsory military service, he did not inform military authorities that he was a conscientious objector and that he would refuse to serve in the army;\nc. The applicant complied with the Turkish law of general application. In fact, the applicant benefitted from this law to obtain a three-year deferment to continue his studies and thus postpone his military service. By acting in this way the applicant acknowledged the legitimacy of the compulsory military service system for at least three years;\nd. The applicant never publicly objected to having to serve in the army; and\ne. The applicant never took part in any anti-war demonstrations.",
    "[13]\nThe conclusion of the Conclusion fell within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes having regard to the facts presented.\n2. Was it reasonable for the panel to conclude that the penalties for evasion of military service that is compulsory under a law of general application do not constitute persecution?",
    "[14]\nThe applicant claimed the RPD disregarded evidence that Kurdish draft-evaders had been beaten and mistreated in prison and that several of them had died, as well as evidence that Turkish draft-evaders can be prosecuted repeatedly, which can also amount to persecution.",
    "[15]\nWith regard to these allegations, I agree with the respondent that the panel concluded that:\nThe Turkish law requiring compulsory military service is a law of general application; the claimant has offered no proof to substantiate his assertion that he would be sentenced to an additional prison term as a Kurdish conscientious objector. On the contrary, the documentary evidence indicates that he would be sentenced in the same way as all other draft evaders. The possibility of the claimant being imprisoned for up to three years is not persecution, as the Federal Court has recognized.",
    "[16]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Federal Court of Appeal determined that prosecutions and incarcerations of a conscientious objector for refusing to do his military service does not constitute persecution based on a Convention refugee ground.",
    "[17]\nIn this case, the Board did not accept that the applicant was a conscientious objector or that he would face consequences, other than legal prosecution, if he refused to complete his military service. The Board found that the applicant would not face a risk if he were to return to Turkey, and rejected the section 97 claim.",
    "[18]\nThis Court has already ruled that the possibility of being imprisoned for up to three years in such circumstances does not amount to persecution and that the fact that Turkish prisons are not of the same standard as Canadian prisons does not rise to the level of torture or risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual punishment. (See for example\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .)\nFindings",
    "[19]\nThe Board is entitled to considerable deference. It reasonably found that the evidence adduced by the applicant to rebut the negative findings and to support his allegations did not succeed in doing so. The Board reasonably determined that the applicant would not face a risk upon his return, even if he were to be perceived as being a conscientious objector.",
    "[20]\nFor these reasons, the application is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",

Il a atteint l'âge de 19 ans en 1998 et normalement aurait dû commencer son service militaire obligatoire, mais a obtenu un sursis d'appel au service de trois ans pour terminer ses études. Pour ce faire, il a dû signer une entente selon laquelle il effectuerait son service après ses études. Il n'a pas soulevé son objection de conscience, craignant d'être pris pour un terroriste.\n[3]\nEn 2000 la fin du sursis approchait, mais il croyait en la non-violence et ne voulait ni servir ni se battre contre son peuple. Son père l'a donc aidé à quitter la Turquie avec un visa étudiant et à rejoindre un frère aîné en Suisse. Il a fréquenté une école de langues, mais ceci ne pouvait pas être compté comme un cours universitaire pour fins de prorogation du sursis d'appel. Le sursis est expiré en 2001. Son passeport turc est expiré en 2006. Il a obtenu un diplôme en français en 2007. Il est ensuite resté en Suisse sans statut puisque c'était impossible pour lui de demander l'asile dans ce pays sans se faire expulser vers la Turquie. En 2011, il a pris le passeport de son frère et s'est rendu au Canada. Il réclame l'asile en raison de sa nationalité, sa race, et le fait d'être un objecteur de conscience.\nDécision contestée\n[4]\nLe tribunal a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas de possibilité sérieuse que le demandeur soit persécuté du fait de sa race et de sa nationalité. Il n'existe pas de droit absolu ni partiel au statut d'objecteur de conscience et la crainte de poursuite pour insoumission au service militaire obligatoire ne constitue pas une crainte justifiée d'être victime de persécution au sens de la définition de réfugié. Le demandeur n'avait pas établi qu'il risquait d'être soumis à la torture, à une menace à sa vie, ou à des traitements ou peines cruels et inusités, s'il retournait en Turquie.\n[5]\nLe tribunal a noté que la Cour fédérale a restreint la notion d'objection de conscience au cas où le demandeur d'asile refuse toute participation aux actions militaires. Ce demandeur n'avait pas démontré qu'il avait de profondes croyances religieuses or philosophiques l'opposant au service militaire, ni qu'il appartenait à une organisation d'objecteurs de conscience. Il n'avait pas révélé aux autorités militaires qu'il refusait de servir, ne s'est jamais opposé publiquement au service militaire ou à la guerre, et a bénéficié de la loi d'application générale lui permettant de reporter son service jusqu'à la fin de ses études. Il n'avait pas démontré que s'il était condamné pour insoumission ou désertion, des peines supplémentaires à la norme seraient infligées en vue de son statut d'objecteur de conscience. La possibilité d'une sentence pouvant atteindre un maximum de trois ans n'équivalait pas à la persécution en l'absence de circonstances aggravantes.\n[6]\nLe tribunal a rejeté la demande d'asile.\nQuestions en litige\n[7]\nLes questions en litige sont les suivantes:\na. Est-ce qu'il était raisonnable pour le tribunal de conclure que le demandeur n'était pas un objecteur de conscience ?\nb. Est-ce qu'il était raisonnable pour le tribunal de conclure que les peines prévues pour insoumission à la loi d'application générale imposant le service militaire n'équivalaient pas à de la persécution ?\nNorme de contrôle\n[8]\nLes deux questions doivent être contrôlées selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir par exemple\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nAnalyse\n1. Est-ce qu'il était raisonnable pour le tribunal de conclure que le demandeur n'était pas un objecteur de conscience ?\n[9]\nEn l'espèce, le demandeur cherche à se prévaloir de la troisième exception dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[14] Ainsi, un demandeur ne peut généralement revendiquer le statut de réfugié au titre de la Convention des Nations Unies relative au statut des réfugiés (la Convention) ni, par conséquent, au titre de l'article 96 de la LIPR, uniquement parce qu'il ne veut pas servir dans l'armée de son pays. Selon M. Hathaway, il existe cependant trois exceptions à cette règle. [] La troisième et dernière exception s'applique aux personnes ayant des \"objections de principe\" au service militaire, plus connues sous le nom d'\"objecteurs de conscience\".\n[10]\nLe demandeur soumet que la SPR n'a pas examiné la possibilité de persécution du fait de son origine kurde, arrivant à sa conclusion sans présentant d'analyse sur ce point. Je trouve que le demandeur n'a pas allégué être persécuté en raison du fait qu'il est kurde - ni dans son récit écrit, ni dans son témoignage à l'audience. Par conséquent, le Tribunal n'avait pas à statuer sur ce motif.\n[11]\nLe demandeur allégeait de plus que la SPR ne l'a pas questionné sur ses croyances religieuses durant l'audience et donc ses allégations à ce sujet ne sont pas contredites.\n[12]\nCompte tenu du témoignage oral et de la preuve documentaire, la Commission a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur n'est pas un objecteur de conscience. Son raisonnement comprend les points suivants:\na. Le demandeur n'appartient pas à une organisation composée d'objecteurs de conscience;\nb. Lorsque le demandeur a initialement été appelé pour faire son service militaire obligatoire, il n'a pas révélé aux autorités militaires qu'il était un objecteur de conscience et qu'il refusait de servir dans l'armée;\nc. Le demandeur s'est conformé à la loi turque d'application générale. En effet, le demandeur s'est prévalu de cette loi afin d'obtenir une dispense de trois ans pour poursuivre ses études et ainsi reporter son service militaire. En agissant ainsi le demandeur a reconnu la légitimité du système du service militaire obligatoire pendant au moins trois ans;\nd. Le demandeur ne s'est jamais opposé publiquement au fait de servir dans l'armée; et\ne. Le demandeur n'a jamais pris part à des manifestations contre la guerre.\n[13]\nLa conclusion de la Conclusion s'avérait une issue possible et acceptable en vue des faits présentés.\n2. Est-ce qu'il était raisonnable pour le tribunal de conclure que les peines prévues pour insoumission à la loi d'application générale imposant le service militaire n'équivalaient pas à de la persécution ?\n[14]\nLe demandeur allégeait que la SPR avait ignoré la preuve que des insoumis kurdes ont été battus et maltraités en prison et que plusieurs sont morts, et la preuve que les insoumis turcs peuvent être traduits en justice de façon répétitive, ceci pouvant aussi constituer de la persécution.\n[15]\nEn ce qui a trait à ces allégations je suis d'accord avec le défendeur que le Tribunal a conclu que:\nLa loi turque qui prévoit le service militaire obligatoire est d'application générale;\nLe demandeur n'a offert aucune preuve à l'appui de son affirmation selon laquelle il serait condamné à une peine d'emprisonnement supplémentaire à titre d'objecteur de conscience kurde. Au contraire, la preuve documentaire indique qu'il serait condamné de la même façon que tous les autres insoumis; et\nLa possibilité que le demandeur soit emprisonné pour une période pouvant aller jusqu'à trois ans n'équivaut pas à de la persécution telle que l'a déjà reconnu cette Cour.\n[16]\nDans l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour d'appel fédérale a conclu que le fait d'intenter des poursuites et d'incarcérer un objecteur de conscience qui refuse d'effectuer son service militaire ne constitue pas de la persécution fondée sur un motif visé par la Convention sur les réfugiés.\n[17]\nEn l'espèce, la Commission n'a pas accepté que le demandeur était un objecteur de conscience et elle n'a pas accepté que le demandeur subirait des conséquences, outre une poursuite judiciaire, s'il refusait d'effectuer son service militaire. La Commission a conclu que le demandeur ne serait pas exposé à un danger s'il retournait en Turquie, et elle a rejeté la demande fondée sur l'article 97.\n[18]\nCette Cour a déjà reconnu que l'emprisonnement pour une période allant jusqu'à trois ans dans de telles circonstances n'équivalait pas à de la persécution et que le fait que les prisons turques ne respectent pas les mêmes normes que les prisons canadiennes ne répond pas au critère de la torture ou de menace à la vie ou de peine cruelle et inusitée. (Voir par exemple\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .)\nConclusions\n[19]\nLa Commission bénéficie d'une retenue appréciable. Elle a raisonnablement conclu que la preuve soumise par le demandeur pour réfuter les conclusions défavorables et pour appuyer ses allégations n'y est pas parvenue. La Commission a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur ne serait pas exposé à un risque à son retour, même s'il était perçu comme étant un objecteur de conscience.\n[20]\nPour ces motifs, la demande est rejetée.\nJUGEMENT\n[21]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n[End of document]",

In fact, the applicant benefitted from this law to obtain a three-year deferment to continue his studies and thus postpone his military service. By acting in this way the applicant acknowledged the legitimacy of the compulsory military service system for at least three years;\nd. The applicant never publicly objected to having to serve in the army; and\ne. The applicant never took part in any anti-war demonstrations.\n\n[13]\nThe conclusion of the Conclusion fell within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes having regard to the facts presented.\n2. Was it reasonable for the panel to conclude that the penalties for evasion of military service that is compulsory under a law of general application do not constitute persecution?\n\n[14]\nThe applicant claimed the RPD disregarded evidence that Kurdish draft-evaders had been beaten and mistreated in prison and that several of them had died, as well as evidence that Turkish draft-evaders can be prosecuted repeatedly, which can also amount to persecution.\n\n[15]\nWith regard to these allegations, I agree with the respondent that the panel concluded that:\nThe Turkish law requiring compulsory military service is a law of general application; the claimant has offered no proof to substantiate his assertion that he would be sentenced to an additional prison term as a Kurdish conscientious objector. On the contrary, the documentary evidence indicates that he would be sentenced in the same way as all other draft evaders. The possibility of the claimant being imprisoned for up to three years is not persecution, as the Federal Court has recognized.\n\n[16]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Federal Court of Appeal determined that prosecutions and incarcerations of a conscientious objector for refusing to do his military service does not constitute persecution based on a Convention refugee ground.\n\n[17]\nIn this case, the Board did not accept that the applicant was a conscientious objector or that he would face consequences, other than legal prosecution, if he refused to complete his military service. The Board found that the applicant would not face a risk if he were to return to Turkey, and rejected the section 97 claim.\n\n[18]\nThis Court has already ruled that the possibility of being imprisoned for up to three years in such circumstances does not amount to persecution and that the fact that Turkish prisons are not of the same standard as Canadian prisons does not rise to the level of torture or risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual punishment. (See for example\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .)\nFindings\n\n[19]\nThe Board is entitled to considerable deference. It reasonably found that the evidence adduced by the applicant to rebut the negative findings and to support his allegations did not succeed in doing so. The Board reasonably determined that the applicant would not face a risk upon his return, even if he were to be perceived as being a conscientious objector.\n\n[20]\nFor these reasons, the application is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[21]\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> application for judicial review pursuant to section 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, ch 27 [LIPR], relating to the decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] rendered on October 23, 2012, concluding that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nContext",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court upheld the Refugee Protection Division’s (RPD) decision denying the applicant refugee status, finding the RPD’s reasoning reasonable under the standard of review.",
      "Regarding conscientious objection, the court affirmed the RPD’s conclusion that the applicant did not demonstrate a principled objection to military service sufficient to qualify for refugee status. This was based on the applicant’s failure to join a conscientious objector organization, his initial compliance with Turkish law by obtaining a deferment, his lack of public opposition to military service, and his failure to inform authorities of his objections when initially called up.",
      "The court acknowledged the established legal principle that simply refusing military service does not automatically qualify someone as a refugee, citing exceptions for principled objections (conscientious objectors).",
      "The court found the RPD’s assessment of the penalties for draft evasion reasonable. The RPD determined the applicant hadn’t proven he’d face additional punishment *because* of his beliefs as a Kurdish conscientious objector, but would be treated like any other draft evader. A potential three-year sentence, in itself, was deemed not to constitute persecution under established Federal Court precedent.",
      "The court relied on prior Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal decisions establishing that prosecution and incarceration for refusing military service, even for conscientious objectors, does not necessarily constitute persecution under the Convention.",
      "The court dismissed the applicant’s claims regarding mistreatment of Kurdish draft evaders, finding no evidence to suggest the applicant would face different treatment than other evaders. The court also reiterated previous rulings that standard Turkish prison conditions do not rise to the level of torture or cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "The court deferred to the RPD’s factual findings, stating they were entitled to considerable deference and that the applicant failed to successfully rebut those findings."
