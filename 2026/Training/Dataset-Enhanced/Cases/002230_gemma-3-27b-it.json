    "[1]\nHarrington, J.\n: Mr. Aggi de Oliveira is Brazilian. He is a lawyer. He speaks flawless idiomatic English. He is gay.",
    "[2]\nHe has sought protection in Canada because he fears persecution in Brazil based on his sexual orientation. The final event which caused him to leave Brazil was an attack in the early morning hours by two \"hoodies\" who at knife point threatened to kill him if he did not change his \"faggot\" ways. He went to the police to file a complaint. They told him to come back in the morning. Instead, he came here.",
    "[3]\nThe board member of the Refugee Protection Division, of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, who heard his case found him to be credible and to have a genuine subjective fear of persecution should he be returned to Brazil. He analyzed the claim under section 96 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n(IRPA) on the basis that Mr. Aggi de Oliveira was a member of a \"particular social group\"; gay men. As a result, the member was only required to find a serious possibility of persecution of similarly situated individuals. Had he considered Mr. Aggi de Oliveira to be simply a victim of crime, the analysis would have been under section 97, which requires an applicant to prove on the higher standard of the balance of probabilities that he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The board member determined that Mr. Aggi de Oliveira's claim was not objectively well-founded because there was adequate state protection in Brazil, which protection was not sought. In this judicial review, Mr. Aggi de Oliveira, who was self-represented at his refugee hearing, but who is now represented by counsel, alleges not only that the board member's analysis of state protection was unreasonable, and actually incorrect in law, but also that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias in that he did not get a fair hearing because of remarks of the member which he took to be homophobic.\nDECISION",
    "[4]\nI find that there is no basis for alleging bias on the part of the board member. I find further that he applied the correct legal test regarding state protection and that his decision was reasonable. The application shall therefore be dismissed.\nBIAS",
    "[5]\nNatural justice dictates that a party be given a reasonable chance to make his or her case or defence before a neutral decision maker. Bias, real or apprehended, taints the actual or perceived objectivity of the decision maker and violates natural justice. Faced with such a situation, the general rule, as laid down by the Supreme Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), is that the reviewing court is not to consider what the decision would have been, had there been a fair hearing. A new hearing is required.",
    "[6]\nThe test to ascertain bias, as set out by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in\nCommittee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , has universally been followed. He said at page 394:\nThe proper test to be applied in a matter of this type was correctly expressed by the Court of Appeal. As already seen by the quotation above, the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that Mr. Crowe, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\"\nHe added that the grounds of the apprehension must be substantial and not based on a \"very sensitive or scrupulous conscience.\"",
    "[7]\nNatural justice, including procedural fairness, is beyond the pale of judicial review. No deference whatsoever is owed to the decision maker (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2003] SCJ No 28 (QL)). The hearing was conducted on 12 June 2012, and the decision rendered 26 September 2012. It was only after that decision that Mr. Aggi de Oliveira complained about the board member's behaviour during the hearing. Indeed, at the conclusion he told the board member:\nThanks for hearing me ... Thanks for especially making me feel comfortable because I thought it would be sort of - I don't know. I read - I was reading yesterday 'cause the nature of this hearing is non-adversarial - adversarial right? Non-adversarial, that's the word I read [...] I thought [...] there would be someone here trying to prove the opposite of what I am seeking.",
    "[8]\nThe Ministers submit that had there been any apprehension of bias on the part of the board member, Mr. Aggi de Oliveira waved same. As I have found that there is no reasonable basis for apprehending bias in the first place, I do not have to consider whether his silence over a three and a half month period constituted a waiver.",
    "[9]\nThe allegations against the board member are that he was disrespectful, too casual and confrontational. In stating that Vancouver was a gay-friendly city, while some of the environs were not, some of his language may have been taken to indicate that he was not gay himself. He also referred to Mr. Aggi de Oliveira's spouse as his \"boyfriend\" rather than as his \"husband\" or \"spouse\". The reference to his spouse as \"boyfriend\" is not demeaning. Mr. Aggi de Oliveira himself referred to him as his \"partner\" not his \"spouse\". No marriage certificate was produced.",
    "[10]\nDuring the hearing, he inquired how he had met his spouse, which was on a website. The board member said \"that is kind of romantic\". Mr. Aggi de Oliveira said this was stated in a sarcastic tone. However, not only a transcript of the hearing, but a recording thereof was produced as well. There was no sarcasm whatsoever in the statement. Rather, in context, \"romantic\" means full-hardy, risky, certainly not cool and calculated.",
    "[11]\nMr. Aggi de Oliveira has the impression that the board member has a personal bias against or non-impartiality towards homosexual men, in part because he referred to them as \"dude\".",
    "[12]\nThe board member was commenting upon changes in Vancouver, and identified areas that \"are very gay positive parts of town ...but you get out to the Valley, Abbotsford, Langley ...\", at which point Mr. Aggi de Oliveira himself added \"New Westminster\". The board member continued \"I wouldn't hold hands with a dude down there. I wouldn't kiss a dude down there. They're very conservative, so it's just ...you know ...one hour out of Vancouver, you're going to be in homophobic land.\"",
    "[13]\nThe word \"dude\" came up because of the conversational tone of the hearing. This was not a case of an applicant testifying through an interpreter. Mr. Aggi de Oliveira speaks flawless idiomatic English, which lent itself to a more relaxed hearing. Perhaps, \"dude\" was not the best word, but any word would do if one is looking to take offence. Nobody enlightened me as to whether \"dude\" has a meaning other than that set out in the dictionary.",
    "[14]\nHis point was that Canada is not universally accepting, and this led to an analysis of the situation in Brazil, where major cities are gay friendly, at least in specific areas. He may have had an internal flight alternative in mind, but instead decided on state protection.",
    "[15]\nThe alleged confrontation was when the member said that Mr. Aggi de Oliveira may have blown off his chances by declining to return to the police station in the light of day. The member's tone was not aggressive; Mr. Aggi de Oliveira was not intimidated and replied in kind. The member is entitled to cross-examine. The remark fell far short of that and simply was fair comment on the concept of state protection.",
    "[16]\nIt would have been relatively easy for the board member to camouflage any bias on his part. He mentioned, but did not give much weight, to two incidents. The first is that after having been attacked by the \"hoodies\", even before reporting to the police he prepared and sent a long email to Canadian officials saying he was on his way here. The second is that he had developed an online relationship with a French national and they agreed to meet in Vancouver where they subsequently married. These incidents could have put his subjective fear into question, a fear which the board member nevertheless fully accepted.\nSTATE PROTECTION",
    "[17]\nMr. Aggi de Oliveira recounted a number of incidents over several years, none of which alone, or in the aggregate, could be considered persecution, save and except the incident involving the \"hoodies\". Being told by a waiter not to kiss his boyfriend in a Brazilian restaurant is hardly a sign of persecution, particularly since no evidence was led that passionate kissing between male and female would have been acceptable.",
    "[18]\nMr. Aggi de Oliveira speculates as to why, after the attack by the \"hoodies\" he was told to come back during the day shift. It may well have been that there was only a skeleton staff in the station. In any event, he was unable to identify his attackers.",
    "[19]\nThe test for state protection is well known. The burden is on the applicant and the more democratic the country the more likely we are to presume that state protection is available. The board member found that state protection for gays and lesbians in Brazil is far from perfect, but applying the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\nCanada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), concluded that, based on the review of the country conditions, protection was adequate. That is the test. One cannot insist upon perfection.",
    "[20]\nBrazil is a democracy. Those who finally caused him to leave Brazil were not state actors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 1, [2007] FCJ No 584 (QL), after referring to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) and\nMinister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), Mr. Justice Sexton, speaking for the Court of Appeal, said at paragraph 57: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> together teach that in the case of a developed democracy, the claimant is faced with the burden of proving that he exhausted all the possible protections available to him and will be exempted from his obligation to seek state protection only in the event of exceptional circumstances: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at page 534, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at page 176. Reading all these authorities together, a claimant coming from a democratic country will have a heavy burden when attempting to show that he should not have been required to exhaust all of the recourses available to him domestically before claiming refugee status. In view of the fact that the United States is a democracy that has adopted a comprehensive scheme to ensure those who object to military service are dealt with fairly, I conclude that the appellants have adduced insufficient support to satisfy this high threshold. Therefore, I find that it was objectively unreasonable for the appellants to have failed to take significant steps to attempt to obtain protection in the United States before claiming refugee status in Canada.",
    "[21]\nSo it is in this case.\nORDER",

Aggi de Oliveira est un avocat brésilien homosexuel. Il parle l'anglais de façon impeccable et idiomatique.\n[2]\nLe demandeur a présenté une demande d'asile au Canada parce qu'il craint d'être persécuté au Brésil en raison de son orientation sexuelle. L'événement qui l'a décidé à quitter le Brésil est une agression au petit matin par deux hommes cagoulés qui, à la pointe d'un couteau, ont menacé de le tuer s'il ne changeait pas son comportement de [traduction]  pédale . Il s'est rendu à la police pour déposer une plainte. Les policiers lui ont dit de revenir le matin. Il est plutôt venu au Canada.\n[3]\nLe commissaire de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada qui a entendu sa cause a conclu qu'il avait une véritable crainte subjective d'être persécuté advenant son renvoi au Brésil. Le commissaire a analysé la demande d'asile au titre de l'article 96 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n(la LIPR) étant donné que M. Aggi de Oliveira appartenait à un  groupe social , les hommes homosexuels. Ainsi, le commissaire était uniquement tenu de conclure à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution pour les personnes se trouvant dans une situation semblable. S'il avait estimé que M. Aggi de Oliveira était simplement la victime d'un acte criminel, son analyse aurait été effectuée au titre de l'article 97, qui exige qu'un demandeur prouve, selon la norme plus élevée de la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il est personnellement exposé au risque d'être soumis à la torture ou à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités. Le commissaire a conclu que la demande d'asile de M. Aggi de Oliveira n'était pas objectivement bien fondée parce qu'il existait une protection adéquate de l'État au Brésil, protection qu'il n'a pas cherché à obtenir. Dans le cadre du présent contrôle judiciaire, M. Aggi de Oliveira, qui se représentait lui-même à l'audience de sa demande d'asile, mais qui est maintenant représenté par un avocat, allègue que l'analyse du commissaire relative à la protection de l'État était déraisonnable et, en fait, erronée en droit. Il allègue également une crainte raisonnable de partialité: il n'aurait pas obtenu une audience équitable en raison des remarques du commissaire qui, selon lui, étaient de nature homophobe.\nDécision\n[4]\nJe conclus qu'il n'existe aucun fondement à l'allégation de partialité de la part du commissaire. Je conclus de plus que ce dernier a appliqué le critère juridique pertinent concernant la protection de l'État et que sa décision était raisonnable. La demande sera donc rejetée.\nPartialité\n[5]\nLa justice naturelle commande qu'une partie ait la possibilité raisonnable de présenter sa cause devant un décideur neutre. La partialité, réelle ou appréhendée, entache l'objectivité véritable ou perçue du décideur et porte atteinte à la justice naturelle. Devant une telle situation, la règle générale, comme l'a énoncée la Cour suprême dans l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), est que la cour de révision ne doit pas chercher à savoir quelle décision aurait été rendue s'il y avait eu une audience équitable. Il faut procéder à une nouvelle audience.\n[6]\nLe critère pour vérifier l'existence de la partialité, énoncé par le juge de Grandpré dans l'arrêt\nCommittee for Justice and Liberty et autres c L'Office national de l'énergie et autres\n, [1978] 1 RCS 369, a été suivi de façon universelle. Voici ce qu'il a déclaré à la page 394:\nLa Cour d'appel a défini avec justesse le critère applicable dans une affaire de ce genre. Selon le passage précité, la crainte de partialité doit être raisonnable et le fait d'une personne sensée et raisonnable qui se poserait elle-même la question et prendrait les renseignements nécessaires à ce sujet. Selon les termes de la Cour d'appel, ce critère consiste à se demander  à quelle conclusion en arriverait une personne bien renseignée qui étudierait la question en profondeur, de façon réaliste et pratique. Croirait-elle que, selon toute vraisemblance, M. Crowe, consciemment ou non, ne rendra pas une décision juste? \nIl a ajouté que les motifs de crainte doivent être sérieux et non fondés sur le critère d'  une personne de nature scrupuleuse ou tatillonne .\n[7]\nLa justice naturelle, laquelle comprend l'équité procédurale, dépasse la portée du contrôle judiciaire. Le décideur n'a droit à aucune déférence (\nSyndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2003] ACS no 28 (QL)). L'audience a eu lieu le 12 juin 2012, et la décision a été rendue le 26 septembre 2012. Ce n'est qu'après que la décision a été rendue que M. Aggi de Oliveira s'est plaint du comportement du commissaire au cours de l'audience. Voici d'ailleurs ce que le demandeur a déclaré au commissaire à la fin de l'audience:\n[traduction] Je vous remercie de m'avoir entendu [...] Merci particulièrement de m'avoir mis à l'aise parce que je croyais que vous seriez du genre - je ne sais pas. J'ai lu - je lisais hier, qu'à cause de la nature non contradictoire - contradictoire, n'est-ce pas? Non contradictoire, c'est le mot que j'ai lu [...] J'ai cru [...] que quelqu'un ici tenterait de prouver le contraire de ce que je cherche à obtenir.\n[8]\nLes ministres soutiennent que si M. Aggi de Oliveira a pu craindre que le commissaire puisse être partial, il a renoncé à faire valoir cette crainte. Comme j'ai déjà conclu qu'il n'y avait aucun fondement raisonnable à la crainte de partialité, je n'ai pas à examiner la question de savoir si le silence du demandeur pendant une période de trois mois et demi constituait une renonciation.\n[9]\nLes allégations formulées à l'encontre du commissaire sont que ce dernier a manqué de respect et avait une attitude trop désinvolte et d'affrontement. Il a déclaré que Vancouver était une ville ouverte aux homosexuels, alors que certains endroits ne l'étaient pas, et certaines de ses paroles pouvaient permettre de penser qu'il n'était pas lui-même homosexuel. Il a également désigné le conjoint de M. Aggi de Oliveira comme son \nboyfriend\n (petit ami) plutôt que comme son  mari  ou son  conjoint . Le fait de désigner son conjoint comme son \nboyfriend\n n'est pas méprisant. M. Aggi de Oliveira l'a lui-même désigné comme étant son \npartner\n (partenaire), non comme son  conjoint . Aucun certificat de mariage n'a été présenté.\n[10]\nAu cours de l'audience, le commissaire a demandé de quelle façon le demandeur avait rencontré son conjoint. La rencontre a eu lieu par le biais d'un site Web. Le commissaire a indiqué que [traduction]  c'est assez romantique . Selon M. Aggi de Oliveira, cette déclaration a été faite sur un ton sarcastique. Toutefois, outre la transcription de l'audience, un enregistrement de celle-ci a été présenté, et j'estime que la déclaration ne contenait aucun sarcasme. Si on la remet dans le contexte dans lequel elle a été dite, le mot [traduction]  romantique  signifie téméraire, risqué, par opposition à froid et calculé.\n[11]\nM. Aggi de Oliveira a le sentiment que le commissaire a un préjugé personnel à l'encontre des homosexuels ou qu'il est partial à leur endroit parce qu'il les a désignés comme étant des \ndude\n (mecs).\n[12]\nLe commissaire faisait des observations sur les changements survenus à Vancouver et a identifié des quartiers qui [traduction]  sont des parties de la ville où les homosexuels sont très bien accueillis [...], mais vous vous rendez à Valley, Abbotsford, Langley [...] , et M. Aggi de Oliveira a lui-même ajouté  New Westminster . Le commissaire a poursuivi en déclarant ce qui suit: [traduction]  Je ne tiendrais pas la main d'un mec là-bas. Je n'embrasserais pas un mec là-bas. Ils sont très conservateurs, alors c'est simplement [...] vous savez [...] à une heure à l'extérieur de Vancouver, vous allez vous trouver en terrain homophobe. \n[13]\nLe mot \ndude\n est survenu en raison du ton de l'audience qui avait des allures de conversation. Il ne s'agit pas d'une affaire où le demandeur témoignait par l'entremise d'un interprète. M. Aggi de Oliveira parle l'anglais de façon impeccable et idiomatique, ce qui a permis une audience au ton plus informel. Le mot \ndude\n n'était peut-être pas le plus approprié, mais aucun mot ne ferait l'affaire si quelqu'un cherche à s'offusquer. Aucune partie ne m'a éclairé sur la question de savoir si le mot \ndude\n avait une autre signification que celle figurant dans le dictionnaire.\n[14]\nLe commissaire faisait valoir que le Canada n'était pas ouvert d'esprit partout, ce qui a donné lieu à une analyse de la situation au Brésil, où les grandes villes sont accueillantes pour les homosexuels, du moins dans certains quartiers. Le commissaire peut avoir eu à l'esprit la possibilité de refuge intérieur, mais il a plutôt tranché l'affaire au regard de la protection de l'État.\n[15]\nL'affrontement dont fait état M. Aggi de Oliveira a eu lieu lorsque le commissaire lui a dit que ses chances d'obtenir protection s'étaient peut-être envolées en ne retournant pas au poste de police une fois le jour venu. Le ton du commissaire n'était pas agressif. M. Aggi de Oliveira n'a pas été intimidé et a répondu sur le même ton. Le commissaire a le droit de contre-interroger les personnes. La remarque était toutefois bien loin de constituer un contre-interrogatoire: il s'agissait simplement d'une observation concernant la notion de la protection de l'État.\n[16]\nIl aurait été relativement facile pour le commissaire de cacher tout préjugé qu'il aurait pu avoir. Il a mentionné deux incidents, sans leur accorder beaucoup de poids. Le premier est le fait qu'après avoir été attaqué par les hommes cagoulés et avant même de signaler l'attaque à la police, le demandeur a rédigé et transmis un long courriel aux représentants canadiens dans lequel il les informait qu'il était en route vers le Canada. Le deuxième est le fait que le demandeur a noué une relation en ligne avec un ressortissant français et que les deux hommes ont convenu de se rencontrer à Vancouver, où ils se sont épousés par la suite. Ces incidents auraient pu permettre de remettre en cause la crainte subjective du demandeur, mais le commissaire a néanmoins pleinement accepté que cette crainte pouvait exister.\nPROTECTION DE L'ÉTAT\n[17]\nM. Aggi de Oliveira a relaté plusieurs incidents qui se sont déroulés sur plusieurs années. Or, ces incidents, pris isolément ou ensemble, ne pourraient être considérés comme de la persécution, à l'exception de celui mettant en cause les hommes cagoulés. On ne saurait considérer que se faire dire par un serveur de ne pas embrasser son petit ami dans un restaurant brésilien constitue de la persécution, plus particulièrement lorsque la personne qui fait une telle affirmation n'a pas cherché à démontrer qu'un baiser passionné entre un homme et une femme aurait été acceptable.\n[18]\nM. Aggi de Oliveira émet des hypothèses sur la raison pour laquelle on lui a dit de revenir pendant le quart de travail de jour après qu'il eut été attaqué par les hommes cagoulés. Il se peut fort bien que cela ait simplement été en raison du très petit nombre de membres du personnel présents au poste. Quoi qu'il en soit, il n'était pas en mesure d'identifier ses agresseurs.\n[19]\nLe critère relatif à la protection de l'État est bien connu. Le fardeau incombe au demandeur et plus un pays est démocratique, plus nous devons présumer que la protection de l'État est vraisemblablement disponible. Le commissaire a estimé que la protection de l'État pour les homosexuels et les lesbiennes au Brésil était loin d'être parfaite. Mais, se fondant sur l'arrêt de la Cour d'appel fédérale\nCanada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), le commissaire a conclu, après examen de la situation du pays, que la protection offerte était adéquate. Il s'agit du critère applicable. On ne peut exiger une protection parfaite.\n[20]\nLe Brésil est une démocratie. Ceux qui ont amené le demandeur à finalement quitter le Brésil n'étaient pas des représentants de l'État.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 1, [2007] ACF no 584 (QL), après avoir renvoyé à\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) et à\nMinistre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), le juge Sexton, s'exprimant au nom de la Cour d'appel, a déclaré au paragraphe 57:\nLes arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ensemble montrent que, dans le cas de démocraties bien établies, il incombe au demandeur de prouver qu'il a épuisé tous les recours dont il pouvait disposer et celui-ci ne sera exempté de son obligation de solliciter la protection de son pays qu'en certaines circonstances exceptionnelles: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 534, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 176. Selon l'ensemble de ces précédents, le demandeur d'asile provenant d'un pays démocratique devra s'acquitter d'un lourd fardeau pour démontrer qu'il n'était pas tenu d'épuiser tous les recours dont il pouvait disposer dans son pays avant de demander l'asile. Compte tenu du fait que les États-Unis sont une démocratie ayant adopté un ensemble complet de mesures garantissant que les personnes s'objectant au service militaire font l'objet d'un traitement juste, je conclus que les appelants n'ont pas produit suffisamment de preuve pour satisfaire à ce critère exigeant. En conséquence, je conclus qu'il était objectivement déraisonnable pour les demandeurs de ne pas avoir pris de mesure tangible pour tenter d'obtenir la protection des États-Unis avant de demander l'asile au Canada.\n[21]\nIl en est de même en l'espèce.\nORDONNANCE\n[22]\nPOUR LES MOTIFS EXPOSÉS,\nLA COUR ORDONNE\n:\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n2. Il n'y a aucune question grave de portée générale à certifier.\n[End of document]",

Gaerdes, for the applicant;\nJennifer Dagsvik, for the respondents.\nSolicitors of Record:\nElgin Cannon & Associates, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the applicant;\nWilliam F. Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the respondents.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nHarrington, J.\n: Mr. Aggi de Oliveira is Brazilian. He is a lawyer. He speaks flawless idiomatic English. He is gay.\n\n[2]\nHe has sought protection in Canada because he fears persecution in Brazil based on his sexual orientation. The final event which caused him to leave Brazil was an attack in the early morning hours by two \"hoodies\" who at knife point threatened to kill him if he did not change his \"faggot\" ways. He went to the police to file a complaint. They told him to come back in the morning. Instead, he came here.\n\n[3]\nThe board member of the Refugee Protection Division, of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, who heard his case found him to be credible and to have a genuine subjective fear of persecution should he be returned to Brazil. He analyzed the claim under section 96 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n(IRPA) on the basis that Mr. Aggi de Oliveira was a member of a \"particular social group\"; gay men. As a result, the member was only required to find a serious possibility of persecution of similarly situated individuals. Had he considered Mr. Aggi de Oliveira to be simply a victim of crime, the analysis would have been under section 97, which requires an applicant to prove on the higher standard of the balance of probabilities that he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The board member determined that Mr. Aggi de Oliveira's claim was not objectively well-founded because there was adequate state protection in Brazil, which protection was not sought. In this judicial review, Mr. Aggi de Oliveira, who was self-represented at his refugee hearing, but who is now represented by counsel, alleges not only that the board member's analysis of state protection was unreasonable, and actually incorrect in law, but also that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias in that he did not get a fair hearing because of remarks of the member which he took to be homophobic.\nDECISION\n\n[4]\nI find that there is no basis for alleging bias on the part of the board member. I find further that he applied the correct legal test regarding state protection and that his decision was reasonable. The application shall therefore be dismissed.\nBIAS\n\n[5]\nNatural justice dictates that a party be given a reasonable chance to make his or her case or defence before a neutral decision maker. Bias, real or apprehended, taints the actual or perceived objectivity of the decision maker and violates natural justice. Faced with such a situation, the general rule, as laid down by the Supreme Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), is that the reviewing court is not to consider what the decision would have been, had there been a fair hearing. A new hearing is required.\n\n[6]\nThe test to ascertain bias, as set out by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in\nCommittee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , has universally been followed. He said at page 394:\nThe proper test to be applied in a matter of this type was correctly expressed by the Court of Appeal. As already seen by the quotation above, the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that Mr. Crowe, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\"\nHe added that the grounds of the apprehension must be substantial and not based on a \"very sensitive or scrupulous conscience.\"\n\n[7]\nNatural justice, including procedural fairness, is beyond the pale of judicial review. No deference whatsoever is owed to the decision maker (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2003] SCJ No 28 (QL)). The hearing was conducted on 12 June 2012, and the decision rendered 26 September 2012. It was only after that decision that Mr. Aggi de Oliveira complained about the board member's behaviour during the hearing. Indeed, at the conclusion he told the board member:\nThanks for hearing me ... Thanks for especially making me feel comfortable because I thought it would be sort of - I don't know. I read - I was reading yesterday 'cause the nature of this hearing is non-adversarial - adversarial right? Non-adversarial, that's the word I read [...] I thought [...] there would be someone here trying to prove the opposite of what I am seeking.\n\n[8]\nThe Ministers submit that had there been any apprehension of bias on the part of the board member, Mr. Aggi de Oliveira waved same. As I have found that there is no reasonable basis for apprehending bias in the first place, I do not have to consider whether his silence over a three and a half month period constituted a waiver.\n\n[9]\nThe allegations against the board member are that he was disrespectful, too casual and confrontational. In stating that Vancouver was a gay-friendly city, while some of the environs were not, some of his language may have been taken to indicate that he was not gay himself. He also referred to Mr. Aggi de Oliveira's spouse as his \"boyfriend\" rather than as his \"husband\" or \"spouse\". The reference to his spouse as \"boyfriend\" is not demeaning. Mr. Aggi de Oliveira himself referred to him as his \"partner\" not his \"spouse\". No marriage certificate was produced.\n\n[10]\nDuring the hearing, he inquired how he had met his spouse, which was on a website. The board member said \"that is kind of romantic\". Mr. Aggi de Oliveira said this was stated in a sarcastic tone. However, not only a transcript of the hearing, but a recording thereof was produced as well. There was no sarcasm whatsoever in the statement. Rather, in context, \"romantic\" means full-hardy, risky, certainly not cool and calculated.\n\n[11]\nMr. Aggi de Oliveira has the impression that the board member has a personal bias against or non-impartiality towards homosexual men, in part because he referred to them as \"dude\".\n\n[12]\nThe board member was commenting upon changes in Vancouver, and identified areas that \"are very gay positive parts of town ...but you get out to the Valley, Abbotsford, Langley ...\", at which point Mr. Aggi de Oliveira himself added \"New Westminster\". The board member continued \"I wouldn't hold hands with a dude down there. I wouldn't kiss a dude down there. They're very conservative, so it's just ...you know ...one hour out of Vancouver, you're going to be in homophobic land.\"\n\n[13]\nThe word \"dude\" came up because of the conversational tone of the hearing. This was not a case of an applicant testifying through an interpreter. Mr. Aggi de Oliveira speaks flawless idiomatic English, which lent itself to a more relaxed hearing. Perhaps, \"dude\" was not the best word, but any word would do if one is looking to take offence. Nobody enlightened me as to whether \"dude\" has a meaning other than that set out in the dictionary.\n\n[14]\nHis point was that Canada is not universally accepting, and this led to an analysis of the situation in Brazil, where major cities are gay friendly, at least in specific areas. He may have had an internal flight alternative in mind, but instead decided on state protection.\n\n[15]\nThe alleged confrontation was when the member said that Mr. Aggi de Oliveira may have blown off his chances by declining to return to the police station in the light of day. The member's tone was not aggressive; Mr. Aggi de Oliveira was not intimidated and replied in kind. The member is entitled to cross-examine. The remark fell far short of that and simply was fair comment on the concept of state protection.\n\n[16]\nIt would have been relatively easy for the board member to camouflage any bias on his part. He mentioned, but did not give much weight, to two incidents. The first is that after having been attacked by the \"hoodies\", even before reporting to the police he prepared and sent a long email to Canadian officials saying he was on his way here. The second is that he had developed an online relationship with a French national and they agreed to meet in Vancouver where they subsequently married. These incidents could have put his subjective fear into question, a fear which the board member nevertheless fully accepted.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[17]\nMr. Aggi de Oliveira recounted a number of incidents over several years, none of which alone, or in the aggregate, could be considered persecution, save and except the incident involving the \"hoodies\". Being told by a waiter not to kiss his boyfriend in a Brazilian restaurant is hardly a sign of persecution, particularly since no evidence was led that passionate kissing between male and female would have been acceptable.\n\n[18]\nMr. Aggi de Oliveira speculates as to why, after the attack by the \"hoodies\" he was told to come back during the day shift. It may well have been that there was only a skeleton staff in the station. In any event, he was unable to identify his attackers.\n\n[19]\nThe test for state protection is well known. The burden is on the applicant and the more democratic the country the more likely we are to presume that state protection is available. The board member found that state protection for gays and lesbians in Brazil is far from perfect, but applying the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\nCanada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), concluded that, based on the review of the country conditions, protection was adequate. That is the test. One cannot insist upon perfection.\n\n[20]\nBrazil is a democracy. Those who finally caused him to leave Brazil were not state actors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 1, [2007] FCJ No 584 (QL), after referring to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) and\nMinister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), Mr. Justice Sexton, speaking for the Court of Appeal, said at paragraph 57: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> together teach that in the case of a developed democracy, the claimant is faced with the burden of proving that he exhausted all the possible protections available to him and will be exempted from his obligation to seek state protection only in the event of exceptional circumstances: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at page 534, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at page 176. Reading all these authorities together, a claimant coming from a democratic country will have a heavy burden when attempting to show that he should not have been required to exhaust all of the recourses available to him domestically before claiming refugee status. In view of the fact that the United States is a democracy that has adopted a comprehensive scheme to ensure those who object to military service are dealt with fairly, I conclude that the appellants have adduced insufficient support to satisfy this high threshold. Therefore, I find that it was objectively unreasonable for the appellants to have failed to take significant steps to attempt to obtain protection in the United States before claiming refugee status in Canada.\n\n[21]\nSo it is in this case.\nORDER\n\n[22]\nFOR REASONS GIVEN;\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. There is no serious question of general importance to certify.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'Immigration (défendeurs)",

      "The court found no basis for alleging bias on the part of the board member, applying the established legal test from *Committee for Justice and Tremblay* which requires a reasonable apprehension of bias held by a reasonable and right-minded person. The court reviewed the board member’s remarks and conduct, including the use of the term “dude” and referring to the applicant’s spouse as a “boyfriend,” and determined they did not demonstrate any real or perceived objectivity issues.",
      "The court determined the board member correctly applied the legal test regarding state protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The court acknowledged the board member found state protection in Brazil to be imperfect but adequate, aligning with the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision in *Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Wang*. The court emphasized that applicants from democratic countries bear a heavy burden to demonstrate why they should be exempt from exhausting domestic remedies before seeking refugee status.",
      "The court reasoned that the applicant failed to demonstrate an inability to access state protection in Brazil. The court noted the applicant’s failure to return to the police station during daylight hours was considered by the board member as potentially diminishing his chances of receiving state protection, but this was deemed fair comment and not an improper cross-examination. The court found the incidents cited by the applicant, such as being asked not to kiss his boyfriend in a restaurant, did not amount to persecution.",
      "The court deferred to the board member’s credibility assessment, noting the board member fully accepted the applicant’s subjective fear of persecution despite considering evidence that could have questioned it (e.g., the email sent to Canadian officials before reporting to the police, the online relationship leading to marriage).",
      "The court highlighted that the hearing’s relaxed tone was attributable to the applicant’s fluency in English and the non-adversarial nature of the proceedings, and that the board member’s comments about varying levels of acceptance in different parts of Canada were relevant to the analysis of state protection and country conditions."
