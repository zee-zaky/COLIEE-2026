    "[1]\nTremblay-Lamer, J.\n: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), for judicial review of a decision of a visa officer (the \"officer\"), dated June 1, 2007, wherein the officer refused the applicant's application for a temporary resident visa in the visitor class (a \"visitor's permit\").\nBACKGROUND",
    "[2]\nThe applicant is a citizen of Pakistan. She applied for a visitor's permit in order to attend her granddaughter's wedding. The application was received along with a letter of invitation from the applicant's grandson at the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan on May 22, 2007.",
    "[3]\nThe officer refused the application, checking off the boxes corresponding to the following two reasons on the standard refusal letter:\n You have not satisfied me that you meet the requirements of Regulation 179: that you would leave Canada at the end of the temporary period if you were authorized to stay. In reaching this decision I considered your ties to your country of residence/citizenship balanced against factors which might motivate you to stay in Canada.\n You have not provided sufficient documentation to support your/your host's income and assets.",
    "[4]\nIn the present case, the applicant challenges the officer's findings that she would not leave Canada at the end of an authorized stay, and that she had not provided sufficient documentation to support her or her host's income and assets. As these findings are highly fact-based, the standard of review applicable is that of patent unreasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 578 (QL), at para.1;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 529 (QL), at para. 6).",
    "[5]\nAccordingly, the officer's findings will remain undisturbed unless they are \"clearly irrational\" or \"evidently not in accordance with reason\"\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 963-64).",
    "[6]\nAt the outset I find it useful to examine the scope of discretion within which the factual findings at issue were made. An indication of the scope of discretion can be found in the objectives of the Act and the ministerial guidelines (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at para. 67).",
    "[7]\nThe objectives of the Act suggest that family reunification is an important consideration. Particularly, section 3.(1)(d) stipulates that one of the objectives of the Act is \"to see that families are reunited in Canada\". Instructively, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at para. 11, in the context of the previous Act, Gibson J. held that \"the wording of this paragraph is broad enough to encompass the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent residents [...] with their close relatives from abroad.\" Moreover, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,\nsupra\n, at paras. 8-9, Pinard J. cited these comments with approval in the context of the current Act.",
    "[8]\nOn the issue of the importance of family reunification in the discretionary decision-making context, the applicant has drawn to the Court's attention to the associated ministerial guidelines. Specifically, section 5.13 of Chapter 11 of the Overseas Processing Manual, (the \"OP 11 manual\"):\nParents and grandparents\nIn April 2005, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration made a policy decision to encourage visa officers to be more flexible in issuing temporary resident visas (TRVs), including multiple entry visas, to parents and grandparents:\n who have applications for permanent residence in process, and\n who wish to visit but do not intend to immigrate to Canada.",
    "[9]\nA review of the CAIPs notes indicate that the visa officer was conscious of the fact that the applicant had 4 children in Pakistan, had travelled abroad previously to Saudi Arabia, had a son in Canada who was out of status, and a grandson who was a Canadian citizen. Further, the officer noted that the tax documentation from the grandson and his wife indicated a \"decent income\", but no proof was provided of the grandson's or his wife's employment and/or savings, or proof of the applicant's funds.",
    "[10]\nThe affidavit submitted by the visa officer, dated September 24, 2007 expands upon the CAIPs notes. Particularly, the officer indicates at para. 9, that because the applicant's son had remained in Canada without status, she might be willing to do the same. Further, at para. 10, he asserts that based on his knowledge of certain cultural practices in Pakistan, specifically that widowed elderly women normally live with their sons and not daughters, the fact that the applicant's only son was living in Canada was a concern. He also indicates at para. 13, that the applicant's trip to Saudi Arabia is not usually considered to be major international travel.",
    "[11]\nWith respect to the first finding, that the officer was not convinced that the applicant would leave Canada upon expiry of the relevant period, I find the officer's conclusion to be patently unreasonable.",
    "[12]\nFirst, the fact that her son was in Canada out of status cannot be used to impute similar conduct to the applicant. People are to be judged according to their own behaviour, not on that of their family members.",
    "[13]\nSecond, while I appreciate the insights that the officer may have gained through his time Pakistan, the mere fact that elderly widowed women normally, in the view of the officer, live with sons and not daughters, cannot be used to attack the bona fides of the applicant's application. This type of gross generalization is patently unreasonable.",
    "[14]\nThird, the officer disregarded the applicant's previous trip to Saudi Arabia, stating that \"a trip to Saudi Arabia is not usually considered to be major international travel in the context in which I assess applications for temporary residence\". With respect, a trip from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia is international travel.",
    "[15]\nWith regards to the officer's findings relating to the documentation of funds. The tax returns of the applicant's grandson and his wife were submitted. The officer was satisfied that the income of the host and his wife was decent. I note that in the context of determining whether sufficient funds are available, section 7 of Chapter 11 of the Overseas Processing Manual, (the \"OP 11 manual\") indicates:\nWhen warranted, officers may consider a combination of any of the following documents as evidence of ability to support an intended visit. The list is not exhaustive but demonstrates various resource documents that may be presented:\n bank statement(s) or deposit book(s) of applicant (and spouse) that show accumulated savings;\n applicant's (and spouse's) letter of employment or employment book, providing name of employer, applicant's position/occupation, date employment commenced and annual earnings;\nhost's or family member in Canada (and spouse's) evidence of income: previous year Revenue Canada Notice of Assessment indicating annual income; or alternately, letter from employer(s) showing position, date employment commenced and annual earnings;\n evidence of size of family for host or family member in Canada (to equate earnings with size of family to ensure ability to support long-term visit); [Emphasis added.]\nWhile the officer is free to consider a combination of any of the listed documents, given that the he was satisfied that the income from the host and spouse was decent, it was patently unreasonable to require that the applicant, a woman in her 80s, produce evidence of her personal funds as well.",

The list is not exhaustive but demonstrates various resource documents that may be presented:\n bank statement(s) or deposit book(s) of applicant (and spouse) that show accumulated savings;\n applicant's (and spouse's) letter of employment or employment book, providing name of employer, applicant's position/occupation, date employment commenced and annual earnings;\nhost's or family member in Canada (and spouse's) evidence of income: previous year Revenue Canada Notice of Assessment indicating annual income; or alternately, letter from employer(s) showing position, date employment commenced and annual earnings;\n evidence of size of family for host or family member in Canada (to equate earnings with size of family to ensure ability to support long-term visit); [Emphasis added.]\nWhile the officer is free to consider a combination of any of the listed documents, given that the he was satisfied that the income from the host and spouse was decent, it was patently unreasonable to require that the applicant, a woman in her 80s, produce evidence of her personal funds as well.\n\n[16]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review of the visa officer's decision is granted. The decision of the visa officer is quashed. The matter is remitted back for re-determination by a different visa officer.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[17]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that\nthe application for judicial review of the visa officer's decision is granted.

      "The court reviewed the visa officer’s decision under the standard of patent unreasonableness, recognizing the fact-based nature of the findings and the officer’s discretionary power within the framework of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.",
      "The court found the officer’s conclusion that the applicant would not leave Canada to be patently unreasonable, primarily because the officer improperly imputed the conduct of the applicant’s son (who was out of status in Canada) onto the applicant herself, violating the principle of judging individuals on their own merits.",
      "The court rejected the officer’s reliance on cultural generalizations regarding elderly widowed women in Pakistan living with their sons, deeming this a ‘gross generalization’ and an unreasonable basis for questioning the applicant’s intentions.",
      "The court considered the applicant’s prior travel to Saudi Arabia as evidence of international travel experience, contradicting the officer’s dismissal of it as not being ‘major international travel.’",
      "Regarding the financial documentation, the court determined it unreasonable to require proof of the applicant’s personal funds when the officer had already deemed the host’s income ‘decent,’ particularly given the applicant’s age (80s). The court referenced OP 11 manual which allows for consideration of a combination of documents and did not require all listed documents to be provided.",
      "The court emphasized the importance of family reunification as an objective of the Act, citing section 3(1)(d) and relevant case law, and noted the ministerial guidelines encouraging flexibility in issuing visas to parents and grandparents with family in Canada.",
      "Based on these findings, the court granted the application for judicial review, quashed the visa officer’s decision, and remitted the matter to a different visa officer for re-determination."
