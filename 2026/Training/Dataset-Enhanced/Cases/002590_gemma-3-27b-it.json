    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nSnider, J.\nNovember 23, 2011.\nCounsel:\nGreg Willoughby, for the applicant;\nKhatidja Moloo-Alam, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nGreg Willoughby, London, Ontario, for the applicant;\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nSnider, J.\n: The Applicant, Mr. Anthony Sinanan, became a permanent resident of Canada in 1998. He has worked outside Canada for lengthy periods of time since his landing. The Applicant submitted his application for citizenship on April 17, 2009. In his application, he disclosed that, during the four-year period prior to his application, he had been physically absent from Canada for 876 days. In other words, he was present in Canada for only 584 days, 511 days short of the required 1,095 days of residence.",
    "[2]\nIn his citizenship application and during the course of two interviews, the Applicant submitted extensive information and materials that related to his \"establishment\" in Canada. By a decision dated December 24, 2010, a citizenship judge concluded that the Applicant had not met the requirement for residency under s. 5(1)(c) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, RSC 1985, c C-29 [\nCitizenship Act\nor\nAct\n]. The Citizenship Judge stated in her decision that she relied on the analytical test of Justice Muldoon in\nRe Pourghasemi\n(1993), 62 FTR 122 (QL), 39 ACWS (3d) 251 (TD) [\nRe Pourghasemi\n], where it was determined that a potential citizen must establish physical presence in Canada for a total of 1,095 days during the four years preceding a citizenship application, pursuant to s. 5(1)(c) of the\nCitizenship Act\n.",
    "[3]\nThe Applicant brings an appeal of this decision pursuant to s. 14(5) of the\nCitizenship Act\n. Such appeals proceed by way of application based on the record before the citizenship judge and are governed by the\nFederal Courts Rules\n, SOR/98-106, pertaining to applications: Rule 300(c).",
    "[4]\nThe Applicant submits that the Citizenship Judge erred in \"blindly\" applying the quantitative test set out in\nRe Pourghasemi\n, without considering that there may be other, equally valid, and more appropriate citizenship residency tests. In his submissions, the Applicant does not argue that the Citizenship Judge was obliged to follow the qualitative analysis articulated in\nRe Papadogiorgakis\n, [1978] 2 FC 208 (QL), 88 DLR (3d) 243 (TD) [\nRe Papadogiorgakis\n] and refined in\nRe Koo\n(1992), [1993] 1 FC 286 (QL), [1992] FCJ No 1107 (TD) [\nRe Koo\n]. Rather, the Applicant accepts that there are two tests, but argues that the Judge erred by failing to provide a rationale for using the quantitative test on the particular facts of this case.",
    "[5]\nAn applicant who meets the criteria set out in s. 5 of the\nCitizenship Act\nwill be granted citizenship. A certain period of residence is required. Pursuant to s. 5(1)(c), an applicant for citizenship must demonstrate that he or she has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada. There is no definition of \"resident\" or\"residence\" under the\nCitizenship Act\n.",
    "[6]\nThe Federal Court has, over the years, endorsed three different approaches to the question of how to interpret the words \"resident\" and \"residence\" in the legislation. Briefly stated, the three lines of jurisprudence fall into two categories: the \"quantitative approach\" and the \"qualitative approach\". The quantitative approach is encompassed in the\nRe Pourghasemi\ntest, applied by the Citizenship Judge in this case, which asks whether the applicant has been physically present in Canada for 1,095 days out of the last four years. This has been referred to as the \"physical presence\" test. The qualitative approach was articulated in\nRe Papadogiorgakis\n, above, and refined in\nRe Koo\n, above. The test in\nRe Koo\n, as first utilized by Justice Reed, allows the citizenship judge to analyze six factors to determine whether an applicant has met the residence requirement by his or her \"centralized ...mode of existence\", even where the applicant falls short of the 1,095-day requirement.",
    "[7]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 87 ACWS (3d) 432 (TD), Justice Lutfy noted the divergence in the jurisprudence and concluded that, if a citizenship judge adopted any one of the three conflicting lines of jurisprudence, and if the facts of the case were properly applied to the principles of that approach, the citizenship judge's decision should not be set aside.",
    "[8]\nIn the 12 years since\nLam\n, the divergence in the Court has not been resolved. Over the past two years, some of my colleagues have attempted to galvanize the Court around one or the other of the tests. In\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 248, Justice Mainville determined that the qualitative approach should be the only test. In contrast, Justice Rennie, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 288 [\nMartinez-Caro\n], carried out a careful analysis of the proper statutory interpretation of s. 5(1)(c) of the\nAct\nand concluded that the physical presence test was the only correct test.",
    "[9]\nIn my view, the matter has come a long way towards resolution through the decision of my colleague, Justice Rennie, in\nMartinez-Caro\n, above. His decision differs from the others cited because, for the first time, a judge of our Court conducted an exacting analysis of s. 5(1)(c) using well-established modern principles of statutory interpretation. Justice Rennie concluded that application of these principles supports the physical presence test, and not the qualitative approach. Even if I might quibble with his characterization of the standard of review as correctness, his analysis and conclusion are compelling. I adopt his reasons and conclusion on this question.",
    "[10]\nThe Applicant argues that recent case law of this Court supports his position that the Citizenship Judge erred in failing to explain why she chose the physical presence test over the\nRe Koo\ntest. In particular, the Applicant cites\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 57 [\nCardin\n], and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 667 [\nEl Ocla\n].",
    "[11]\nI do not read either\nCardin\nor\nEl Ocla\nas establishing an obligation on a citizenship judge to rationalize her choice of test. As I read these cases, they affirm that it will be unreasonable to apply the physical presence test in certain factual situations. In any event, both cases can be distinguished from the case at bar.",
    "[12]\nIn\nCardin\n, Justice Mactavish found that Mr. Cardin's application for citizenship was rejected on the Citizenship Judge's specific finding that his absences from Canada meant that he had not sufficiently \"Canadianized\" himself (\nCardin\n, above at para 13). On reviewing the facts before the Citizenship Judge, Justice Mactavish found that the underlying rationale for applying the\nRe Pourghasemi\ntest was absent; that is, the facts did not support a conclusion that Mr. Cardin had not become \"Canadianized\". Justice Mactavish's decision was not, as submitted by the Applicant, founded on an obligation of the Citizenship Judge to provide a rationale for rejecting the\nRe Koo\ntest. In the case before me, the Citizenship Judge did not base her decision on a finding that the Applicant had not become \"Canadianized\".\nCardin\nis accordingly distinguishable.",
    "[13]\nThe case of\nEl  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is very fact specific. Dr. El Ocla was only 99 days short of the required 1,095 days. In addition, Dr. El Ocla, a tenured professor at a Canadian university, had established himself in many significant ways. On those facts, Justice Barnes concluded that the Citizenship Judge had erred in applying the physical presence test. The facts of the case before me are much less compelling.",
    "[14]\nOne further consideration is that the Citizenship Judge did not ignore any of the evidence of the Applicant's establishment in Canada. The Judge's notes, as contained in the Certified Tribunal Record, are detailed and accurately reflect the facts before her and her view of the evidence. The notes highlight certain concerns with the evidence that extend beyond a mere counting of days. The Judge clearly turned her mind to the nature of the Applicant's establishment in Canada; her observations included the following:\n \"from beginning always worked away [in] Trinidad, Syria, Algeria - never established professional career in Canada\"; and\n \"always vacationed in Trinidad . . . greater connection to Trinidad than Canada\".\nThus, if there was any obligation on the Citizenship Judge to rationalize her choice of test (and I do not believe that there was), her notes provide the rationale for only applying the physical presence test.",
    "[15]\nInsofar as Justice Barnes concluded in\nEl  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 19, that a citizenship judge errs by applying the physical presence test, I simply do not agree that this is a proper interpretation of the law. I prefer the analysis and conclusion of either Justice Rennie in\nMartinez-Caro\nthat the correct (and, thus, only) test is the physical presence test; or Justice Lutfy in\nLam\nthat either test may be used.",
    "[16]\nApplying\nMartinez-Caro\nto the facts of this case leads directly to the conclusion that the Citizenship Judge applied the correct test to the facts before her. There is no question as to whether the Judge ought to have rationalized the choice since the quantitative test is the only correct test. In this case, the decision clearly sets out that the Citizenship Judge was following the physical presence interpretation of s. 5(1)(c). The only question to be determined by the Citizenship Judge was therefore whether the Applicant was physically present in Canada for 1,095 days. The Applicant was not just a few days short; the evidence demonstrates that he was only present in Canada for 584 days during the four year period prior to his application for citizenship.",
    "[17]\nApplying\nLam\nto the facts of this case and on a standard of review of reasonableness, I would conclude that the Citizenship Judge's reliance on the physical presence test was an acceptable choice that was reasonably applied to the facts.",
    "[18]\nIn sum, there is no reviewable error. On either a standard of reasonableness or correctness, the Citizenship Judge did not err by applying the physical presence test to the facts before her. Moreover, there was no obligation upon the Citizenship Judge to provide justification or a rationale for applying the physical presence test rather than the qualitative test from\nRe Koo\n.",
    "[19]\nFor these reasons, the appeal will be dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[20]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe appeal of the Citizenship Judge's decision is dismissed.\n[End of document]"

I prefer the analysis and conclusion of either Justice Rennie in\nMartinez-Caro\nthat the correct (and, thus, only) test is the physical presence test; or Justice Lutfy in\nLam\nthat either test may be used.\n\n[16]\nApplying\nMartinez-Caro\nto the facts of this case leads directly to the conclusion that the Citizenship Judge applied the correct test to the facts before her. There is no question as to whether the Judge ought to have rationalized the choice since the quantitative test is the only correct test. In this case, the decision clearly sets out that the Citizenship Judge was following the physical presence interpretation of s. 5(1)(c). The only question to be determined by the Citizenship Judge was therefore whether the Applicant was physically present in Canada for 1,095 days. The Applicant was not just a few days short; the evidence demonstrates that he was only present in Canada for 584 days during the four year period prior to his application for citizenship.\n\n[17]\nApplying\nLam\nto the facts of this case and on a standard of review of reasonableness, I would conclude that the Citizenship Judge's reliance on the physical presence test was an acceptable choice that was reasonably applied to the facts.\n\n[18]\nIn sum, there is no reviewable error. On either a standard of reasonableness or correctness, the Citizenship Judge did not err by applying the physical presence test to the facts before her. Moreover, there was no obligation upon the Citizenship Judge to provide justification or a rationale for applying the physical presence test rather than the qualitative test from\nRe Koo\n.\n\n[19]\nFor these reasons, the appeal will be dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[20]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe appeal of the Citizenship Judge's decision is dismissed.\n[End of document]",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether the Citizenship Judge erred in applying the 'physical presence' (quantitative) test from *Re Pourghasemi* instead of the 'centralized mode of existence' (qualitative) test from *Re Koo* to determine the applicant's residency for citizenship.",
      "The court determined that the *Re Pourghasemi* (physical presence) test is the correct interpretation of s. 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act, relying heavily on Justice Rennie’s analysis in *Martinez-Caro*. This analysis involved applying modern principles of statutory interpretation to conclude the legislation supports a physical presence requirement.",
      "The court acknowledged a historical divergence in jurisprudence regarding the interpretation of 'residence' within the Act, with three different approaches having been endorsed by the Federal Court over time. However, it found *Martinez-Caro* provided a compelling resolution.",
      "The court rejected the argument that the Citizenship Judge was obligated to rationalize her choice of test, finding that cases like *Cardin* and *El Ocla* did not establish such an obligation. Instead, those cases addressed situations where the physical presence test was *unreasonable* to apply given specific facts, which was not the case here.",
      "The court distinguished *Cardin* because the Citizenship Judge in this case did not base her decision on a lack of 'Canadianization,' and distinguished *El Ocla* because the facts were less compelling (the applicant was only 99 days short of the requirement and had significant ties to Canada).",
      "The court reviewed the Citizenship Judge’s notes and found they demonstrated consideration of the applicant’s ties to Canada, specifically noting his long-term work outside of Canada and stronger connections to Trinidad, supporting the application of the physical presence test.",
      "The court concluded that, even under a standard of reasonableness, the Citizenship Judge’s decision to apply the physical presence test was acceptable, given the applicant was significantly short of the 1,095-day requirement (only present for 584 days).",
      "The court affirmed that there was no reviewable error, finding the Citizenship Judge did not err in applying the correct test and was not required to provide a rationale for choosing it."
