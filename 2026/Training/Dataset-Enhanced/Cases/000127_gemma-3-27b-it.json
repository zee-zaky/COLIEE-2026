Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI. Introduction",
    "[1]\nScott, J.\n: This is an application by Annetta Profitt (Ms. Profitt), made pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001 [\nIRPA\n], for judicial review of the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated July 6, 2011, whereby the Board concluded that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under sections 97 and 98 of the\nIRPA\n.",
    "[2]\nFor the following reasons, this application for judicial review is allowed.\nII. Facts",
    "[3]\nMs. Profitt is a 49-year-old citizen of Guyana. At an early age, Ms Profitt was adopted by Ms. Sheila Conway.",
    "[4]\nMs. Profitt is the mother of three children, Cleveland Gray, Tamica Blair and David Blair.\nSeveral years of abuse",
    "[5]\nIn 1979, Ms. Profitt met Alex Beckles at a party; eventually, they commenced a relationship. Mr. Beckles is a policeman. In 1980, Ms. Profitt moved in with him and, after a year in their relationship, realized that Mr. Beckels was a very aggressive man. She suffered verbal, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Mr. Beckles for several years. He often forced her to have sexual intercourse with his colleagues or mistresses. If Ms. Profitt protested or sought protection at a friend's house, he would find her and mistreat her.",
    "[6]\nMr. Beckles forcibly confined Ms. Profitt for several months in 2001 and physically and sexually abused her while forcing Ms. Profitt's younger son, David, to watch. Mr. Beckles also sexually abused David on occasions. Ms. Profitt unsuccessfully attempted to file several complaints with the police.\nPermanent resident status in the US and criminal convictions",
    "[7]\nIn 1988, Ms. Profitt married Horriss Harding and acquired permanent resident status in the United States. However, she lost her status after having been convicted of three criminal charges. She was convicted of Grand larceny in the 3rd degree in 1992 and sentenced to a period of probation of 3 years. In 1995, she was convicted for attempted grand larceny and was sentenced to 1 to 3 years of imprisonment but served 6 months in a boot-camp instead. In 2006, Ms. Profitt was charged with possession of forged instruments but was convicted of falsifying business records. She was imprisoned for almost 2 years and deported subsequently to Guyana.\nArrival in Canada",
    "[8]\nMs. Profitt was mistreated by Mr. Beckels for approximately 6 months in 2008. She eventually disclosed her mistreatment at the hands of Mr. Beckels to her parents. Ms. Profitt's father obtained a false passport for her and bought a plane ticket to Canada for her. She arrived in Toronto on January 28, 2009, and immediately made her refugee claim.\nImpugned decision",
    "[9]\nThe Board concluded that Ms. Profitt was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection and rejected her application. It found that state protection in Guyana would reasonably be forthcoming and that law enforcement authorities would make serious efforts to protect Ms. Profitt from her ex common-law partner if she returned to Guyana. It also concluded there were serious reasons to consider that Ms. Profitt had committed a serious non-political crime within the meaning of Article 1F(\nb\n) of the Convention\nRelating to the\nStatus of Refugees [\nConvention\n] during her stay in the US.\nIII. Legislation",
    "[10]\nThe applicable legislation is appended to this judgment.\nIV. Issues and standard of review\nA. Issues",
    "[11]\nThe issues raised by this application are as follows:\n1. Did the Board provide sufficient reasons for its exclusion of Ms. Profitt under section 98 of the IRPA?\n2. Did the Board err in excluding Ms. Profitt from refugee protection by concluding that she had committed a serious non-political crimes under Article 1F(b) of the Convention?\n3. Did the Board err in its assessment of the adequacy of state protection in Guyana?\nB. Standard of review",
    "[12]\nThe determination of a serious non-political crime is a question of law and the appropriate standard of review is that of correctness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 44) while the application of Article 1F(\nb\n) of the Convention attracts a standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[13]\nThe adequacy of state protection is a mixed question of fact and law and is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nV. Parties' submissions\nA. Ms. Profitt's submissions",
    "[14]\nMs. Profitt argues that the Board failed to provide appropriate reasons as to why it preferred the Respondent's submissions regarding the exclusion under section 98 of the\nIRPA\nand Article 1F\n(b)\nof the\nConvention\n. The Board wrote in paragraphs 19 and 20 of its decision: [19] Based on the evidence and the text of the parties' written submissions, I find that I prefer the Minister's case. Minister's counsel has persuaded me, on balance of probabilities, that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant has committed a \"serious non-political crime\". [20] Reliable evidence provided by the Minister establishes serious reasons to consider that the claimant committed grand larceny in the U.S. in 1991, attempted grand larceny in the U.S. in 1995, and falsifying business records in the U.S. in 2006. Moreover, Minister's counsel has persuaded me that the claimant's 2006 falsify business records crime in the U.S. falls within the definition of \"serious criminality\" in the\nIRPA\n, and is therefore sufficient in itself to trigger a rebuttable presumption that the claimant has committed a crime that falls within the meaning of \"serious non-political crime\" under Article 1F (\nb\n) of the Convention.",
    "[15]\nMs. Profitt submits that the brief analysis of her mental health fails to appreciate the significance of this evidence and its relation to the contextual analysis required by\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. In sum, she argues that the Board did not provide adequate reasons nor did it properly apply the criteria propounded by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[16]\nFurthermore, Ms. Profitt submits that she was found guilty of minor class felonies. The Board did not correctly determine the gravity of Ms. Profitt's convictions and failed to properly identify the equivalent Canadian offences and conduct a detailed examination thereof, as required by <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\nshould only be applied in cases involving serious crimes. Given the purpose of the\nIRPA\nand the nature of her crimes, Ms. Profitt argues that she should be entitled to claim refugee protection in Canada.",
    "[17]\nMs. Profitt submits that the Board made three errors with respect to its assessment of the adequacy of state protection in Guyana.",
    "[18]\nFirst, it is submitted that the Board applied the wrong test as to the issue of state protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 49 [\nWard\n], the Supreme Court of Canada stated that\"only in situations in which state protection \"might reasonably [be] forthcoming\", will the claimant's failure to approach the state for protection defeat his claim\". Mere willingness to provide protection on the part of the state does not satisfy that requirement.",
    "[19]\nMs. Profitt reminds us that \"in order for state protection to be adequate, it must be effective at an operational level\" (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[20]\nIn the present case, the Board simply made a recitation of the legislation and existing resources in Guyana without a qualitative assessment of state protection.",
    "[21]\nSecondly Ms. Profitt submits that the Board erroneously assessed the documentary evidence regarding domestic violence in Guyana. Clear and convincing evidence can rebut a presumption of state protection (see\nWard\ncited above). The documentary evidence before the Board showed the inadequacy of state protection afforded to victims of domestic violence in Guyana.",
    "[22]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court determined that state protection in Guyana was simply not available or inadequate.",
    "[23]\nMs. Profitt also submits that the Board failed to consider her personal circumstances. It ignored her previous attempts to seek state protection and her exhaustive medical history. It also ignored the fact that Ms. Profitt's abuser was, and still is, a police officer. This failure to consider an applicant's situation is \"even more serious given that the Board did not make any negative credibility assessments\" (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) as alleged.\nB. Respondent's submissions",
    "[24]\nAccording to the Respondent, in reaching its conclusion, the Board considered both the Respondent's and Ms. Profitt's submissions. The Board reasonably assigned more weight to the Respondent's argument (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[25]\nThe Respondent further argues that despite Ms. Profitt's submission that she was convicted of minor class felonies, she was actually charged with five class D felonies. Since she entered a guilty plea on all three occasions, she was convicted of lesser serious crimes. However, as Ms. Profitt was charged with possession of forged instruments, the Board had serious reasons to believe that she had committed a crime equivalent to the uttering of forged documents.",
    "[26]\nThe Respondent also submits that there were serious reasons to believe that Ms. Profitt had committed a serious non-political crime. The Board considered all the mitigating and aggravating factors, as required under <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Board reasonably decided that Ms. Profitt was excluded from refugee protection under Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n.",
    "[27]\nThe Respondent further submits that the Board considered all the evidence adduced by Ms. Profitt and determined that she had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection in Guyana with clear and convincing evidence (see\nWard,\ncited above;\nCanada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above). This test is not met merely because an applicant is able to demonstrate that state cannot provide perfect protection to its citizens. Rather, the proper test is whether the protection is adequate.",
    "[28]\nThe Board, according to the Respondent, is also presumed to have weighed all the evidence and is not required to mention or refer to particular passages from adverse documentary evidence (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 16-17). The Respondent submits that, in this case, the Board weighed all the evidence and reasonably determined that state protection is adequate in Guyana.\nVI. Analysis\n1. Did the Board provide sufficient reasons for its exclusion of Ms. Profitt under section 98 of the IRPA?",
    "[29]\nMs. Profitt argues that the Board failed to provide sufficient reasons explaining why she was excluded from seeking refugee protection in Canada under section 98 of\nIRPA\n.",
    "[30]\nIn\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Supreme Court of Canada held that \"[i]t is true that the breach of a duty of procedural fairness is an error in law. Where there are no reasons in circumstances where they are required, there is nothing to review. But where, as here, there are reasons, there is no such breach. Any challenge to the reasoning/result of the decision should therefore be made within the reasonableness analysis\". In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, at para 47, the Supreme Court wrote these often quoted comments: \"in judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\". Sufficient reasons must be given to enable the reviewing Court to determine whether or not a decision-maker erred (see\nVia rail  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 19). It is the Court's duty to review the decision and determine whether or not it falls within the range of possible and acceptable outcomes.",
    "[31]\nThe Board did not provide adequate reasons explaining why Ms. Profitt was excluded from refugee protection. The Board only stated that \"Minister's counsel has persuaded me, on a balance of probabilities, that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant has committed a \"serious non-political crime\"\" (see para 19 of the Board's decision). It also mentioned that \"Minister's counsel has persuaded me that the claimant's 2006 falsifying business records crime in the U.S. falls within the definition of \"serious criminality\" in the\nIRPA\n, and is therefore sufficient in itself to trigger a rebuttable presumption that the claimant has committed a crime that falls within the meaning of \"serious non-political crime\" under Article 1F(b) of the Convention\" (see para 20 of the Board's decision).",
    "[32]\nWhile some reasons were provided by the Board, the Court concludes that they are insufficient in that the Board failed to conduct the proper analysis and apply the appropriate test, as required by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, at para 44, or properly weigh the mitigating evidence adduced by Ms. Profitt.\n2. Did the Board err in excluding Ms. Profitt from refugee protection by concluding that she had committed serious non-political crimes under Article 1F(b) of the Convention?",
    "[33]\nThe adequacy of reasons is fundamental in determining whether a decision-maker has properly applied the jurisprudence or the law to the facts of the case. In this instance, the Board did not apply the required criteria in order to determine if Ms. Profitt's crimes were serious enough to attract Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n.",
    "[34]\nIn paragraph 44 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, the Federal Court of Appeal wrote: \"I believe there is a consensus among the courts that the interpretation of the exclusion clause in Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n, as regards the seriousness of a crime, requires an evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction\". Even though the Board considered Ms. Profitt's past abuse as a mitigating factor, it still concluded that is was not sufficient to rebut the serious non-political crime presumption. However, no evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution and the penalty prescribed were made by the Board. It is just not enough to make plain remarks on the criminal history of an Applicant.",
    "[35]\nFurthermore, the Board failed to assess the circumstances surrounding the crime. Ms. Profitt had suffered years of physical, sexual and mental abuse. Several medical reports were adduced before the Board to demonstrate Ms. Profitt's medical condition and its relation to years of exploitation and mistreatment. Dr. Celeste Thirlwell evaluated Ms. Profitt and found that she\"developed many symptoms which are consistent with Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)\" (see page 73 of the Applicant's Record, Volume I). Another report by Dr. Linda Weber reveals that \"Ms. Profitt suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Episodes. From August 2009-May 2010 she was seen 9 times by Dr. Meador with concerns of worsening suicidal ideation, nightmares, flashbacks, hypervigilance and anxiety. Dr. Meador was very concerned about her health and well-being and arranged an urgent psychiatric consultation with Dr. Gotlib\" (see page 78 of the Applicant's record, Volume I). Dr. Les Richmond performed a complete physical assessment of Ms. Profitt and concluded that she had sustained several injuries consistent with her history of physical abuse.",
    "[36]\nAccording to Dr. Thirlwell's evaluation, \"the crimes she committed in the United States were not premeditated or meant to cause harm. They were examples of her maladaptive way of seeking help\"(see page 77 of the Applicant's Record, Volume I). Even though Ms. Profitt committed crimes in the US, the above factors were not properly assessed or were simply ignored by the Board. Failure to follow the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> doctrine gives rise to a reviewable error.",
    "[37]\nThe Court having concluded in favour of Ms. Profitt on the first two issues there is no need to proceed to an analysis with respect to the issue of adequacy of state protection in Guyana.\nVII. Conclusion",
    "[38]\nThe Board has failed to provide give adequate reasons as to why it concluded that Ms. Profitt was excluded under Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n, and to follow the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> doctrine. Therefore, this application for judicial review is allowed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[39]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n1. This application for judicial review is allowed; and\n2. There is no question of general importance to certify.\nAnnex\nSections 96, 97 and 98 of the\nImmigration and refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001 [\nIRPA\n] read as follows\n:\nConvention refugee\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\nPerson in need of protection\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nPerson in need of protection\n(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.\nExclusion - Refugee Convention\n98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nArticle 1F(b) of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees reads as follows:\n1F(\nb\n) He has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Scott\n[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée par Annetta Profitt (Mme Profitt) en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001 [la LIPR], de la décision du 6 juillet 2011 par laquelle la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait ni qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention conformément à l'article 96, ni celle de personne à protéger au sens des articles 97 et 98 de la LIPR."

Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI. Introduction\n[1]\nScott, J.\n: This is an application by Annetta Profitt (Ms. Profitt), made pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001 [\nIRPA\n], for judicial review of the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated July 6, 2011, whereby the Board concluded that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under sections 97 and 98 of the\nIRPA\n.\n[2]\nFor the following reasons, this application for judicial review is allowed.\nII. Facts\n[3]\nMs. Profitt is a 49-year-old citizen of Guyana. At an early age, Ms Profitt was adopted by Ms. Sheila Conway.\n[4]\nMs. Profitt is the mother of three children, Cleveland Gray, Tamica Blair and David Blair.\nSeveral years of abuse\n[5]\nIn 1979, Ms. Profitt met Alex Beckles at a party; eventually, they commenced a relationship. Mr. Beckles is a policeman. In 1980, Ms. Profitt moved in with him and, after a year in their relationship, realized that Mr. Beckels was a very aggressive man. She suffered verbal, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Mr. Beckles for several years. He often forced her to have sexual intercourse with his colleagues or mistresses. If Ms. Profitt protested or sought protection at a friend's house, he would find her and mistreat her.\n[6]\nMr. Beckles forcibly confined Ms. Profitt for several months in 2001 and physically and sexually abused her while forcing Ms. Profitt's younger son, David, to watch. Mr. Beckles also sexually abused David on occasions. Ms. Profitt unsuccessfully attempted to file several complaints with the police.\nPermanent resident status in the US and criminal convictions\n[7]\nIn 1988, Ms. Profitt married Horriss Harding and acquired permanent resident status in the United States. However, she lost her status after having been convicted of three criminal charges. She was convicted of Grand larceny in the 3rd degree in 1992 and sentenced to a period of probation of 3 years. In 1995, she was convicted for attempted grand larceny and was sentenced to 1 to 3 years of imprisonment but served 6 months in a boot-camp instead. In 2006, Ms. Profitt was charged with possession of forged instruments but was convicted of falsifying business records. She was imprisoned for almost 2 years and deported subsequently to Guyana.\nArrival in Canada\n[8]\nMs. Profitt was mistreated by Mr. Beckels for approximately 6 months in 2008. She eventually disclosed her mistreatment at the hands of Mr. Beckels to her parents. Ms. Profitt's father obtained a false passport for her and bought a plane ticket to Canada for her. She arrived in Toronto on January 28, 2009, and immediately made her refugee claim.\nImpugned decision\n[9]\nThe Board concluded that Ms. Profitt was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection and rejected her application. It found that state protection in Guyana would reasonably be forthcoming and that law enforcement authorities would make serious efforts to protect Ms. Profitt from her ex common-law partner if she returned to Guyana. It also concluded there were serious reasons to consider that Ms. Profitt had committed a serious non-political crime within the meaning of Article 1F(\nb\n) of the Convention\nRelating to the\nStatus of Refugees [\nConvention\n] during her stay in the US.\nIII. Legislation\n[10]\nThe applicable legislation is appended to this judgment.\nIV. Issues and standard of review\nA. Issues\n[11]\nThe issues raised by this application are as follows:\n1. Did the Board provide sufficient reasons for its exclusion of Ms. Profitt under section 98 of the IRPA?\n2. Did the Board err in excluding Ms. Profitt from refugee protection by concluding that she had committed a serious non-political crimes under Article 1F(b) of the Convention?\n3. Did the Board err in its assessment of the adequacy of state protection in Guyana?\nB. Standard of review\n[12]\nThe determination of a serious non-political crime is a question of law and the appropriate standard of review is that of correctness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 44) while the application of Article 1F(\nb\n) of the Convention attracts a standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[13]\nThe adequacy of state protection is a mixed question of fact and law and is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nV. Parties' submissions\nA. Ms. Profitt's submissions\n[14]\nMs. Profitt argues that the Board failed to provide appropriate reasons as to why it preferred the Respondent's submissions regarding the exclusion under section 98 of the\nIRPA\nand Article 1F\n(b)\nof the\nConvention\n. The Board wrote in paragraphs 19 and 20 of its decision:\n[19] Based on the evidence and the text of the parties' written submissions, I find that I prefer the Minister's case. Minister's counsel has persuaded me, on balance of probabilities, that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant has committed a \"serious non-political crime\".\n[20] Reliable evidence provided by the Minister establishes serious reasons to consider that the claimant committed grand larceny in the U.S. in 1991, attempted grand larceny in the U.S. in 1995, and falsifying business records in the U.S. in 2006. Moreover, Minister's counsel has persuaded me that the claimant's 2006 falsify business records crime in the U.S. falls within the definition of \"serious criminality\" in the\nIRPA\n, and is therefore sufficient in itself to trigger a rebuttable presumption that the claimant has committed a crime that falls within the meaning of \"serious non-political crime\" under Article 1F (\nb\n) of the Convention.\n[15]\nMs. Profitt submits that the brief analysis of her mental health fails to appreciate the significance of this evidence and its relation to the contextual analysis required by\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. In sum, she argues that the Board did not provide adequate reasons nor did it properly apply the criteria propounded by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[16]\nFurthermore, Ms. Profitt submits that she was found guilty of minor class felonies. The Board did not correctly determine the gravity of Ms. Profitt's convictions and failed to properly identify the equivalent Canadian offences and conduct a detailed examination thereof, as required by <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\nshould only be applied in cases involving serious crimes. Given the purpose of the\nIRPA\nand the nature of her crimes, Ms. Profitt argues that she should be entitled to claim refugee protection in Canada.\n[17]\nMs. Profitt submits that the Board made three errors with respect to its assessment of the adequacy of state protection in Guyana.\n[18]\nFirst, it is submitted that the Board applied the wrong test as to the issue of state protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 49 [\nWard\n], the Supreme Court of Canada stated that\"only in situations in which state protection \"might reasonably [be] forthcoming\", will the claimant's failure to approach the state for protection defeat his claim\". Mere willingness to provide protection on the part of the state does not satisfy that requirement.\n[19]\nMs. Profitt reminds us that \"in order for state protection to be adequate, it must be effective at an operational level\" (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[20]\nIn the present case, the Board simply made a recitation of the legislation and existing resources in Guyana without a qualitative assessment of state protection.\n[21]\nSecondly Ms. Profitt submits that the Board erroneously assessed the documentary evidence regarding domestic violence in Guyana. Clear and convincing evidence can rebut a presumption of state protection (see\nWard\ncited above). The documentary evidence before the Board showed the inadequacy of state protection afforded to victims of domestic violence in Guyana.\n[22]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court determined that state protection in Guyana was simply not available or inadequate.\n[23]\nMs. Profitt also submits that the Board failed to consider her personal circumstances. It ignored her previous attempts to seek state protection and her exhaustive medical history. It also ignored the fact that Ms. Profitt's abuser was, and still is, a police officer. This failure to consider an applicant's situation is \"even more serious given that the Board did not make any negative credibility assessments\" (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) as alleged.\nB. Respondent's submissions\n[24]\nAccording to the Respondent, in reaching its conclusion, the Board considered both the Respondent's and Ms. Profitt's submissions. The Board reasonably assigned more weight to the Respondent's argument (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[25]\nThe Respondent further argues that despite Ms. Profitt's submission that she was convicted of minor class felonies, she was actually charged with five class D felonies. Since she entered a guilty plea on all three occasions, she was convicted of lesser serious crimes. However, as Ms. Profitt was charged with possession of forged instruments, the Board had serious reasons to believe that she had committed a crime equivalent to the uttering of forged documents.\n[26]\nThe Respondent also submits that there were serious reasons to believe that Ms. Profitt had committed a serious non-political crime. The Board considered all the mitigating and aggravating factors, as required under <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Board reasonably decided that Ms. Profitt was excluded from refugee protection under Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n.\n[27]\nThe Respondent further submits that the Board considered all the evidence adduced by Ms. Profitt and determined that she had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection in Guyana with clear and convincing evidence (see\nWard,\ncited above;\nCanada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above). This test is not met merely because an applicant is able to demonstrate that state cannot provide perfect protection to its citizens. Rather, the proper test is whether the protection is adequate.\n[28]\nThe Board, according to the Respondent, is also presumed to have weighed all the evidence and is not required to mention or refer to particular passages from adverse documentary evidence (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 16-17). The Respondent submits that, in this case, the Board weighed all the evidence and reasonably determined that state protection is adequate in Guyana.\nVI. Analysis\n1. Did the Board provide sufficient reasons for its exclusion of Ms. Profitt under section 98 of the IRPA?\n[29]\nMs. Profitt argues that the Board failed to provide sufficient reasons explaining why she was excluded from seeking refugee protection in Canada under section 98 of\nIRPA\n.\n[30]\nIn\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Supreme Court of Canada held that \"[i]t is true that the breach of a duty of procedural fairness is an error in law. Where there are no reasons in circumstances where they are required, there is nothing to review. But where, as here, there are reasons, there is no such breach. Any challenge to the reasoning/result of the decision should therefore be made within the reasonableness analysis\". In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, at para 47, the Supreme Court wrote these often quoted comments: \"in judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\". Sufficient reasons must be given to enable the reviewing Court to determine whether or not a decision-maker erred (see\nVia rail  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 19). It is the Court's duty to review the decision and determine whether or not it falls within the range of possible and acceptable outcomes.\n[31]\nThe Board did not provide adequate reasons explaining why Ms. Profitt was excluded from refugee protection. The Board only stated that \"Minister's counsel has persuaded me, on a balance of probabilities, that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant has committed a \"serious non-political crime\"\" (see para 19 of the Board's decision). It also mentioned that \"Minister's counsel has persuaded me that the claimant's 2006 falsifying business records crime in the U.S. falls within the definition of \"serious criminality\" in the\nIRPA\n, and is therefore sufficient in itself to trigger a rebuttable presumption that the claimant has committed a crime that falls within the meaning of \"serious non-political crime\" under Article 1F(b) of the Convention\" (see para 20 of the Board's decision).\n[32]\nWhile some reasons were provided by the Board, the Court concludes that they are insufficient in that the Board failed to conduct the proper analysis and apply the appropriate test, as required by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, at para 44, or properly weigh the mitigating evidence adduced by Ms. Profitt.\n2. Did the Board err in excluding Ms. Profitt from refugee protection by concluding that she had committed serious non-political crimes under Article 1F(b) of the Convention?\n[33]\nThe adequacy of reasons is fundamental in determining whether a decision-maker has properly applied the jurisprudence or the law to the facts of the case. In this instance, the Board did not apply the required criteria in order to determine if Ms. Profitt's crimes were serious enough to attract Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n.\n[34]\nIn paragraph 44 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, the Federal Court of Appeal wrote: \"I believe there is a consensus among the courts that the interpretation of the exclusion clause in Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n, as regards the seriousness of a crime, requires an evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction\". Even though the Board considered Ms. Profitt's past abuse as a mitigating factor, it still concluded that is was not sufficient to rebut the serious non-political crime presumption. However, no evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution and the penalty prescribed were made by the Board. It is just not enough to make plain remarks on the criminal history of an Applicant.\n[35]\nFurthermore, the Board failed to assess the circumstances surrounding the crime. Ms. Profitt had suffered years of physical, sexual and mental abuse. Several medical reports were adduced before the Board to demonstrate Ms. Profitt's medical condition and its relation to years of exploitation and mistreatment. Dr. Celeste Thirlwell evaluated Ms. Profitt and found that she\"developed many symptoms which are consistent with Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)\" (see page 73 of the Applicant's Record, Volume I). Another report by Dr. Linda Weber reveals that \"Ms. Profitt suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Episodes. From August 2009-May 2010 she was seen 9 times by Dr. Meador with concerns of worsening suicidal ideation, nightmares, flashbacks, hypervigilance and anxiety. Dr. Meador was very concerned about her health and well-being and arranged an urgent psychiatric consultation with Dr. Gotlib\" (see page 78 of the Applicant's record, Volume I). Dr. Les Richmond performed a complete physical assessment of Ms. Profitt and concluded that she had sustained several injuries consistent with her history of physical abuse.\n[36]\nAccording to Dr. Thirlwell's evaluation, \"the crimes she committed in the United States were not premeditated or meant to cause harm. They were examples of her maladaptive way of seeking help\"(see page 77 of the Applicant's Record, Volume I). Even though Ms. Profitt committed crimes in the US, the above factors were not properly assessed or were simply ignored by the Board. Failure to follow the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> doctrine gives rise to a reviewable error.\n[37]\nThe Court having concluded in favour of Ms. Profitt on the first two issues there is no need to proceed to an analysis with respect to the issue of adequacy of state protection in Guyana.\nVII. Conclusion\n[38]\nThe Board has failed to provide give adequate reasons as to why it concluded that Ms. Profitt was excluded under Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n, and to follow the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> doctrine. Therefore, this application for judicial review is allowed.\nJUDGMENT\n[39]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n1. This application for judicial review is allowed; and\n2. There is no question of general importance to certify.\nAnnex\nSections 96, 97 and 98 of the\nImmigration and refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001 [\nIRPA\n] read as follows\n:\nConvention refugee\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\nPerson in need of protection\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nPerson in need of protection\n(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.\nExclusion - Refugee Convention\n98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nArticle 1F(b) of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees reads as follows:\n1F(\nb\n) He has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Scott\n[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée par Annetta Profitt (Mme Profitt) en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001 [la LIPR], de la décision du 6 juillet 2011 par laquelle la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait ni qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention conformément à l'article 96, ni celle de personne à protéger au sens des articles 97 et 98 de la LIPR.\n[2]\nPour les motifs qui suivent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accueillie.\nII. Les faits\n[3]\nMadame Profitt est une citoyenne de la Guyane, âgée de 49 ans. En bas âge, Mme Profitt a été adoptée par Mme Sheila Conway.\n[4]\nMadame Profitt est la mère de trois enfants, Cleveland Gray, Tamica Blair et David Blair.\nPlusieurs années de mauvais traitements\n[5]\nEn 1979, Mme Profitt a rencontré Alex Beckles lors d'une fête; les deux ont par la suite noué une relation. Monsieur Beckless est un policier. En 1980, Mme Profitt a emménagé chez lui et, après avoir vécu avec lui pendant un an, elle a compris que M. Beckles était un homme très agressif. Pendant de nombreuses années, elle a subi la violence verbale, physique et sexuelle de M. Beckles. Il la contraignait souvent à avoir des rapports sexuels avec ses collègues ou ses maîtresses. Si Mme Profitt protestait ou cherchait refuge chez un ami, il savait la trouver et lui infligeait des mauvais traitements.\n[6]\nEn 2001, M. Beckles a séquestré Mme Profitt durant plusieurs mois et il forçait le jeune fils de Mme Profitt, David, à les regarder pendant qu'il agressait sa mère physiquement et sexuellement. Parfois, M. Beckles agressait sexuellement aussi David. Madame Profitt a tenté en vain de déposer plusieurs plaintes auprès de la police.\nStatut de résidente permanente aux É.-U. et condamnations au criminel\n[7]\nEn 1988, Mme Profitt s'est mariée à Horriss Harding et a obtenu la résidence permanente aux États-Unis. Cependant, elle a perdu ce statut après avoir été reconnue coupable de trois accusations criminelles. Elle a été reconnue coupable de vol au troisième degré en 1992 et condamnée à une période probation de trois ans. En 1995, elle a été reconnue coupable de tentatives de vol simple et condamnée à une peine d'emprisonnement d'un an à trois ans, mais a purgé une peine de six mois dans un camp de type militaire. En 2006, Mme Profitt a été accusée de possession de biens contrefaits, mais a été reconnue coupable de falsifier des documents d'affaires. Elle a été incarcérée pendant près de deux ans et a ensuite été expulsée en Guyane.\nArrivée au Canada\n[8]\nMadame Profitt a subi les mauvais traitements de M. Beckels pendant environ 6 mois en 2008. Elle a finalement révélé à ses parents que M. Beckels la maltraitait. Le père de Mme Profitt lui a obtenu un faux passeport et a acheté un billet d'avion pour le Canada. Elle est arrivée à Toronto le 28 janvier 2009 et a immédiatement présenté une demande d'asile.\nLa décision contestée\n[9]\nLa Commission a jugé que Mme Profitt n'avait ni qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger et a rejeté la demande de Mme Profitt. Elle a conclu qu'elle pourrait raisonnablement se prévaloir de la protection de l'État en Guyane et que les autorités chargées de l'application de la loi feraient tout en leur pouvoir pour protéger Mme Profitt de son ex-conjoint de fait si elle retournait en Guyane. Elle a également conclu qu'il existait des motifs sérieux de penser que Mme Profitt avait commis un crime grave de droit commun au sens de la section F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la\nConvention des Nations Unies relative au statut des réfugiés\n[la Convention] durant son séjour aux États-Unis.\nIII. Dispositions législatives\n[10]\nLes dispositions législatives applicables sont jointes en annexe au présent jugement.\nIV. Les questions en litige et la norme de contrôle\nA. Les questions en litige\n[11]\nLes questions en litige soulevées dans la présente demande sont les suivantes:\n1. La Commission a-t-elle suffisamment motivé sa décision pour justifier pourquoi Mme Profitt ne pouvait demander l'asile en application de l'article 98 de la LIPR?\n2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que Mme Profitt avait perpétré des crimes graves de droit commun en vertu de la section Fb) de l'article premier de la Convention et qu'en conséquence elle ne pouvait demander l'asile?\n3. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son évaluation du caractère suffisant de la protection de l'État en Guyane?\nB. La norme de contrôle\n[12]\nLa question de savoir si un crime grave de droit commun a été commis est une question de droit appelant l'application de la norme de la décision correcte (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 50 et 60 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ;\nCanada\n(\nMinistre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 44) alors que l'application de la section F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la Convention est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[13]\nLe caractère suffisant de la protection de l'État est une question mixte de fait et de droit et est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nV. Les observations des parties\nA. Les observations de Mme Profitt\n[14]\nMadame Profitt soutient que la Commission n'a pas suffisamment motivé pourquoi elle avait préféré les observations du défendeur relativement à l'exclusion prévue à l'article 98 de la LIPR et la section F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la Convention. La Commission écrit aux paragraphes 19 et 20 de sa décision:\n[19] ... En m'appuyant sur les éléments de preuve et sur les observations écrites des parties, je penche davantage pour les observations du ministre. La conseil du ministre m'a convaincu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, il existe de sérieux motifs de croire que la demandeure d'asile a commis un crime grave de droit commun.\n[20] Les éléments de preuve fiables fournis par le ministre permettent d'établir qu'il existe des motifs sérieux de croire que la demandeure d'asile a commis un vol au premier degré aux É.-U. en 1991, qu'elle a tenté de commettre un vol au premier degré aux É.-U. en 1995 et qu'elle a falsifié des documents d'affaires aux É.-U. en 2006. De plus, la conseil du ministre m'a convaincu que la falsification de documents d'affaires commise par la demandeure d'asile en 2006 aux É.-U. est considérée comme un crime grave dans la LIPR et suffit en soit à justifier la présomption réfutable voulant que la demandeure d'asile a commis un crime considéré comme étant un crime grave de droit commun suivant l'alinéa F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la Convention.\n[15]\nMadame Profitt fait valoir que la brève évaluation de sa santé mentale ne rend pas compte de l'importance de la preuve et de sa relation avec l'analyse contextuelle requise par\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. En somme, elle soutient que la Commission n'a pas suffisamment motivé sa décision et qu'elle n'a pas appliqué les critères énoncés par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[16]\nDe plus, Mme Profitt soutient qu'elle a été reconnue coupable d'actes délictueux mineurs. La Commission n'a pas bien évalué la gravité des infractions visées par les déclarations de culpabilité de Mme Profitt et n'a pas su retenir les infractions canadiennes équivalentes ni se livrer à un examen approfondi de celles-ci comme le requiert\nJayasekara.\nLa section F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la Convention ne s'applique que dans les cas de crimes graves. Étant donné l'objet de la LIPR et de la nature des crimes de la demanderesse, Mme Profitt soutient qu'elle devrait avoir le droit de demander l'asile au Canada.\n[17]\nMadame Profitt fait valoir que la Commission a commis trois erreurs relativement à son évaluation du caractère suffisant de la protection de l'État en Guyane.\n[18]\nPremièrement, elle fait valoir que la Commission a utilisé un critère erroné relativement à la question de la protection de l'État. Dans\nCanada (Procureur général) c Ward\n, [1993] 2 RCS 689 [\nWard\n], la Cour suprême du Canada a déclaré au paragraphe 49 que  l'omission du demandeur de s'adresser à l'État pour obtenir sa protection fera échouer sa revendication seulement dans le cas où la protection de l'État [traduction] \"aurait pu raisonnablement être assurée\" .La seule volonté de l'État d'assurer la protection ne satisfait pas à cette exigence.\n[19]\nMadame Profitt nous rappelle que  pour être estimée suffisante, la protection assurée par l'État devait être adéquate sur le terrain (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 9;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 40;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[20]\nEn l'espèce, la Commission a simplement repris les dispositions législatives et décrit es ressources existantes en Guyane sans se livrer à une évaluation qualitative de la protection de l'État.\n[21]\nDeuxièmement, Mme Profitt fait valoir que la Commission a apprécié de manière erronée la preuve documentaire relative à la violence familiale en Guyane. Une preuve claire et convaincante peut réfuter la présomption de la protection de l'État (voir\nWard\n, ci-dessus). La preuve documentaire présentée à la Commission démontrait l'insuffisance de la protection de l'État accordée aux victimes de la violence familiale en Guyane.\n[22]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour a déterminé que la protection de l'État en Guyane n'était simplement pas disponible ou qu'elle était insuffisante.\n[23]\nMadame Profitt fait également valoir que la Commission n'a pas pris en compte ses circonstances personnelles. La Commission n'a pas tenu compte du fait qu'elle avait tenté d'obtenir la protection de l'État ni de tous ses antécédents médicaux. Elle n'a pas non plus pris en compte le fait que l'agresseur de Mme Profitt était, et est encore, un policier. Madame Prfoitt allègue que le défaut d'examiner la situation du demandeur est une  erreur d'autant plus importante que la Commission n'avait tiré aucune conclusion défavorable relativement à la crédibilité de la demanderesse  (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nB. Les observations du défendeur\n[24]\nSelon le défendeur, la Commission a tenu compte des observations du défendeur et de celles de Mme Profitt avant de prendre sa décision. La Commission a raisonnablement accordé plus de poids aux arguments du défendeur (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[25]\nLe défendeur soutient en outre que, malgré les observations de Mme Profitt selon lesquelles elle a été reconnue coupable d'actes délictueux mineurs, elle a en fait été reconnue coupable de cinq infractions de la catégorie D. Comme elle a plaidé coupable les trois fois, elle a été reconnue coupable de crimes moins sérieux. Or, comme Mme Profitt a été accusée de possession de biens contrefaits, la Commission avait des raisons sérieuses de croire qu'elle avait commis un crime équivalent à la mise en circulation de faux documents.\n[26]\nLe défendeur fait également valoir qu'il existe des motifs sérieux de croire que Mme Profitt a commis un crime grave de droit commun. La Commission a examiné toutes les circonstances atténuantes et aggravantes, comme le requiert <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La Commission a raisonnablement décidé que Mme Profitt ne pouvait demander l'asile en vertu de la section Fb) de l'article premier de la Convention.\n[27]\nLe défendeur soutient en outre que la Commission a examiné toute la preuve présentée par Mme Profitt et jugé que celle-ci n'avait pas réfuté la présomption de la protection de l'État en Guyane au moyen d'une preuve claire et convaincante (voir\nWard,\nci-dessus;\nCanada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus). Le demandeur ne peut satisfaire à ce critère simplement en démontrant que l'État ne peut pas assurer une protection parfaite à ses citoyens. Le critère approprié consiste plutôt à savoir si la protection est suffisante.\n[28]\nLa Commission, selon le défendeur, est également présumée avoir apprécié toute la preuve et n'est pas tenue de mentionner des passages particuliers de la preuve documentaire contraire ou d'y renvoyer (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 16 et 17). Le défendeur soutient qu'en l'espèce, la Commission a soupesé toute la preuve et qu'elle a raisonnablement jugé que la protection de l'État était suffisante en Guyane.\nVI. Analyse\n1. La Commission a-t-elle suffisamment motivé sa décision pour justifier pourquoi Mme Profitt ne pouvait demander l'asile en application de l'article 98 de la LIPR?\n[29]\nMadame Profitt soutient que la Commission n'a pas suffisamment motivé sa décision pour expliquer en quoi il ne lui était pas permis de demander l'asile au Canada en application de l'article 98 de la LIPR.\n[30] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a affirmé au paragraphe 22 que  [l] e manquement à une obligation d'équité procédurale constitue certes une erreur de droit. Or, en l'absence de motifs dans des circonstances où ils s'imposent, il n'y a rien à contrôler. Cependant, dans les cas où, comme en l'espèce,\nil y en a\n, on ne saurait conclure à un tel manquement. Le raisonnement qui sous-tend la décision/le résultat ne peut donc être remis en question que dans le cadre de l'analyse du caractère raisonnable de celle-ci . Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, , la Cour suprême du Canada a formulé au paragraphe 47 les commentaires suivants souvent cités:  Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.  La décision doit être suffisamment motivée pour permettre à la cour de révision de déterminer si le décideur a commis une erreur (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 19). Il incombe à la Cour d'examiner la décision et de déterminer si elle appartient aux issues possibles et acceptables.\n[31]\nLa Commission n'a pas suffisamment motivé sa décision pour expliquer pourquoi Mme Profitt ne pouvait demander l'asile. La Commission a seulement déclaré que  [l] a conseil du ministre m'a convaincu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, il existe de sérieux motifs de croire que la demandeure d'asile a commis un crime grave de droit commun  (voir le paragraphe 19 de la décision de la Commission). Elle a également affirmé que  la conseil du ministre m'a convaincu que la falsification de documents d'affaires commise par la demandeure d'asile en 2006 aux É.-U. est considérée comme un crime grave dans la LIPR et suffit en soit à justifier la présomption réfutable voulant que la demandeure d'asile a commis un crime considéré comme étant un crime grave de droit commun  en vertu de la section F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la Convention (voir le paragraphe 20 de la décision de la Commission).\n[32]\nBien que la Commission ait fourni quelques motifs, la Cour conclut qu'ils étaient insuffisants parce que la Commission ne s'étaient pas livrée à une analyse convenable et n'avait pas appliqué le bon critère, comme la Cour d'appel fédérale le requiert dans\nJayasekara,\nci-dessus, au paragraphe 44, ou n'avait pas apprécié convenablement les éléments de preuve atténuants présentés par Mme Profitt.\n2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que Mme Profitt avait perpétré des crimes graves de droit commun en vertu de la section Fb) de l'article premier de la Convention et qu'en conséquence elle ne pouvait demander l'asile?\n[33]\nLa suffisance des motifs joue un rôle fondamental pour savoir si le décideur a bien appliqué la jurisprudence ou le droit aux faits de l'espèce. En l'espèce, la Commission ne s'est pas livrée à une analyse convenable et n'a pas appliqué les bons critères pour décider si les crimes de Mme Profitt étaient suffisamment graves pour commander l'application de la section F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la Convention.\n[34]\nLa Cour d'appel fédérale a affirmé ce qui suit au paragraphe 44 de\nJayasekara,\nci-dessus:  Je crois que les tribunaux s'entendent pour dire que l'interprétation de la clause d'exclusion de la section F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la Convention exige, en ce qui concerne la gravité du crime, que l'on évalue les éléments constitutifs du crime, le mode de poursuite, la peine prévue, les faits et les circonstances atténuantes et aggravantes sous-jacentes à la déclaration de culpabilité.  Même si la Commission a estimé que les mauvais traitements subis par Mme Profitt dans le passé constituaient un facteur atténuant, elle a néanmoins conclu qu'ils ne suffisaient pas pour réfuter la présomption de crime grave de droit commun. Cependant, la Commission n'a fait aucune évaluation des éléments constitutifs du crime, du mode de poursuite et de la peine prévue. Formuler de simples remarques sur les antécédents criminels de la demanderesse n'est pas suffisant.\n[35]\nDe plus, la Commission ne s'est pas penchée sur les circonstances du crime. Madame Profitt avait enduré des années d'agressions physiques, sexuelles et mentales. Plusieurs rapports médicaux ont été présentés à la Commission pour rendre compte de l'état de santé de Mme Profitt et de la manière dont il se rattache aux années d'exploitation et de maltraitance. La docteure Celeste Thirlwell a examiné Mme Profitt et a conclu qu'elle [traduction]  présentait plusieurs symptômes qui sont conformes au syndrome de la femme battue (SFB), à l'état de stress post-traumatique (ESPT) et au trouble dissociatif de l'identité (TDI)  (voir à la page 73 du dossier de la demanderesse, volume 1). Un autre rapport de la docteure Linda Weber révèle que [traduction]  Mme Profitt souffre de l'état de stress post-traumatique et d'épisodes dépressifs majeurs. Du mois d'août 2009 au mois de mai 2010, elle a été vue neuf fois par le docteur Meador, en raison des problèmes d'idéation suicidaire qui s'aggravaient, de cauchemars, de flashbacks, d'hypervigilance et d'angoisse. Le docteur Meador était très préoccupé par la santé et le bien-être de la demanderesse et a obtenu une consultation psychiatrique urgente auprès du docteur Gotlib  (voir à la page 78 du dossier de la demanderesse, volume 1). Le docteur Les Richmond a effectué plusieurs évaluations physiques complètes de Mme Profitt et a conclu qu'elle avait subi plusieurs blessures qui corroboraient ses antécédents d'agressions physiques.\n[36]\nSelon l'évaluation du docteur Thirlwell, [traduction]  les crimes qu'elle a perpétrés aux États-Unis n'ont pas été prémédités et ne visaient pas à causer des préjudices. Ils constituaient des exemples d'une façon mal appropriée de chercher de l'aide  (voir à la page 77 du dossier de la demanderesse, volume 1). Même si Mme Profitt a commis des crimes aux États-Unis, la Commission n'a pas bien évalué les facteurs susmentionnés ou n'en a tout simplement pas tenu compte. Le fait de ne pas suivre les principes énoncés dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> donne lieu à une erreur susceptible de contrôle.\n[37]\nÉtant donné que la Cour donne raison à Mme Profitt sur les deux premières questions, il ne sera pas nécessaire de répondre à la question de la suffisance de la protection de l'État en Guyane.\nVII. Conclusion\n[38]\nLa Commission n'a pas suffisamment motivé sa décision pour justifier pourquoi Mme Profitt ne pouvait bénéficier de l'application de la section F\nb\n) de l'article premier de la Convention et elle n'a pas suivi les principes exposés dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Par conséquent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accueillie.\nJUGEMENT\n[39]\nLA COUR ORDONNE:\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie.\n2. Il n'y a aucune question de portée générale à certifier.\nAnnexe\nLes articles 96, 97 et 98 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001 [LIPR] disposent\n:\nDéfinition de réfugié \n96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:\n a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;\n b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.\nPersonne à protéger\n97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:\na) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;\nb) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:\n(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,\n(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,\n(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,\n(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.\nPersonne à protéger\n(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.\nExclusion par application de la Convention sur les réfugiés\n98. La personne visée aux sections E ou F de l'article premier de la Convention sur les réfugiés ne peut avoir la qualité de réfugié ni de personne à protéger.\nLa section Fb) de l'article premier de la\nConvention des Nations Unies relative au statut des réfugiés\ndispose:\n1F\nb\n) Qu'elles ont commis un crime grave de droit commun en dehors du pays d'accueil avant d'y être admises comme réfugiés;\n[End of document]",

Introduction\n\n[1]\nScott, J.\n: This is an application by Annetta Profitt (Ms. Profitt), made pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001 [\nIRPA\n], for judicial review of the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated July 6, 2011, whereby the Board concluded that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under sections 97 and 98 of the\nIRPA\n.\n\n[2]\nFor the following reasons, this application for judicial review is allowed.\nII. Facts\n\n[3]\nMs. Profitt is a 49-year-old citizen of Guyana. At an early age, Ms Profitt was adopted by Ms. Sheila Conway.\n\n[4]\nMs. Profitt is the mother of three children, Cleveland Gray, Tamica Blair and David Blair.\nSeveral years of abuse\n\n[5]\nIn 1979, Ms. Profitt met Alex Beckles at a party; eventually, they commenced a relationship. Mr. Beckles is a policeman. In 1980, Ms. Profitt moved in with him and, after a year in their relationship, realized that Mr. Beckels was a very aggressive man. She suffered verbal, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Mr. Beckles for several years. He often forced her to have sexual intercourse with his colleagues or mistresses. If Ms. Profitt protested or sought protection at a friend's house, he would find her and mistreat her.\n\n[6]\nMr. Beckles forcibly confined Ms. Profitt for several months in 2001 and physically and sexually abused her while forcing Ms. Profitt's younger son, David, to watch. Mr. Beckles also sexually abused David on occasions. Ms. Profitt unsuccessfully attempted to file several complaints with the police.\nPermanent resident status in the US and criminal convictions\n\n[7]\nIn 1988, Ms. Profitt married Horriss Harding and acquired permanent resident status in the United States. However, she lost her status after having been convicted of three criminal charges. She was convicted of Grand larceny in the 3rd degree in 1992 and sentenced to a period of probation of 3 years. In 1995, she was convicted for attempted grand larceny and was sentenced to 1 to 3 years of imprisonment but served 6 months in a boot-camp instead. In 2006, Ms. Profitt was charged with possession of forged instruments but was convicted of falsifying business records. She was imprisoned for almost 2 years and deported subsequently to Guyana.\nArrival in Canada\n\n[8]\nMs. Profitt was mistreated by Mr. Beckels for approximately 6 months in 2008. She eventually disclosed her mistreatment at the hands of Mr. Beckels to her parents. Ms. Profitt's father obtained a false passport for her and bought a plane ticket to Canada for her. She arrived in Toronto on January 28, 2009, and immediately made her refugee claim.\nImpugned decision\n\n[9]\nThe Board concluded that Ms. Profitt was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection and rejected her application. It found that state protection in Guyana would reasonably be forthcoming and that law enforcement authorities would make serious efforts to protect Ms. Profitt from her ex common-law partner if she returned to Guyana. It also concluded there were serious reasons to consider that Ms. Profitt had committed a serious non-political crime within the meaning of Article 1F(\nb\n) of the Convention\nRelating to the\nStatus of Refugees [\nConvention\n] during her stay in the US.\nIII. Legislation\n\n[10]\nThe applicable legislation is appended to this judgment.\nIV. Issues and standard of review\nA. Issues\n\n[11]\nThe issues raised by this application are as follows:\n1. Did the Board provide sufficient reasons for its exclusion of Ms. Profitt under section 98 of the IRPA?\n2. Did the Board err in excluding Ms. Profitt from refugee protection by concluding that she had committed a serious non-political crimes under Article 1F(b) of the Convention?\n3. Did the Board err in its assessment of the adequacy of state protection in Guyana?\nB. Standard of review\n\n[12]\nThe determination of a serious non-political crime is a question of law and the appropriate standard of review is that of correctness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 44) while the application of Article 1F(\nb\n) of the Convention attracts a standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[13]\nThe adequacy of state protection is a mixed question of fact and law and is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nV. Parties' submissions\nA. Ms. Profitt's submissions\n\n[14]\nMs. Profitt argues that the Board failed to provide appropriate reasons as to why it preferred the Respondent's submissions regarding the exclusion under section 98 of the\nIRPA\nand Article 1F\n(b)\nof the\nConvention\n. The Board wrote in paragraphs 19 and 20 of its decision: [19] Based on the evidence and the text of the parties' written submissions, I find that I prefer the Minister's case. Minister's counsel has persuaded me, on balance of probabilities, that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant has committed a \"serious non-political crime\". [20] Reliable evidence provided by the Minister establishes serious reasons to consider that the claimant committed grand larceny in the U.S. in 1991, attempted grand larceny in the U.S. in 1995, and falsifying business records in the U.S. in 2006. Moreover, Minister's counsel has persuaded me that the claimant's 2006 falsify business records crime in the U.S. falls within the definition of \"serious criminality\" in the\nIRPA\n, and is therefore sufficient in itself to trigger a rebuttable presumption that the claimant has committed a crime that falls within the meaning of \"serious non-political crime\" under Article 1F (\nb\n) of the Convention.\n\n[15]\nMs. Profitt submits that the brief analysis of her mental health fails to appreciate the significance of this evidence and its relation to the contextual analysis required by\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. In sum, she argues that the Board did not provide adequate reasons nor did it properly apply the criteria propounded by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[16]\nFurthermore, Ms. Profitt submits that she was found guilty of minor class felonies. The Board did not correctly determine the gravity of Ms. Profitt's convictions and failed to properly identify the equivalent Canadian offences and conduct a detailed examination thereof, as required by <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\nshould only be applied in cases involving serious crimes. Given the purpose of the\nIRPA\nand the nature of her crimes, Ms. Profitt argues that she should be entitled to claim refugee protection in Canada.\n\n[17]\nMs. Profitt submits that the Board made three errors with respect to its assessment of the adequacy of state protection in Guyana.\n\n[18]\nFirst, it is submitted that the Board applied the wrong test as to the issue of state protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 49 [\nWard\n], the Supreme Court of Canada stated that\"only in situations in which state protection \"might reasonably [be] forthcoming\", will the claimant's failure to approach the state for protection defeat his claim\". Mere willingness to provide protection on the part of the state does not satisfy that requirement.\n\n[19]\nMs. Profitt reminds us that \"in order for state protection to be adequate, it must be effective at an operational level\" (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[20]\nIn the present case, the Board simply made a recitation of the legislation and existing resources in Guyana without a qualitative assessment of state protection.\n\n[21]\nSecondly Ms. Profitt submits that the Board erroneously assessed the documentary evidence regarding domestic violence in Guyana. Clear and convincing evidence can rebut a presumption of state protection (see\nWard\ncited above). The documentary evidence before the Board showed the inadequacy of state protection afforded to victims of domestic violence in Guyana.\n\n[22]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court determined that state protection in Guyana was simply not available or inadequate.\n\n[23]\nMs. Profitt also submits that the Board failed to consider her personal circumstances. It ignored her previous attempts to seek state protection and her exhaustive medical history. It also ignored the fact that Ms. Profitt's abuser was, and still is, a police officer. This failure to consider an applicant's situation is \"even more serious given that the Board did not make any negative credibility assessments\" (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) as alleged.\nB. Respondent's submissions\n\n[24]\nAccording to the Respondent, in reaching its conclusion, the Board considered both the Respondent's and Ms. Profitt's submissions. The Board reasonably assigned more weight to the Respondent's argument (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[25]\nThe Respondent further argues that despite Ms. Profitt's submission that she was convicted of minor class felonies, she was actually charged with five class D felonies. Since she entered a guilty plea on all three occasions, she was convicted of lesser serious crimes. However, as Ms. Profitt was charged with possession of forged instruments, the Board had serious reasons to believe that she had committed a crime equivalent to the uttering of forged documents.\n\n[26]\nThe Respondent also submits that there were serious reasons to believe that Ms. Profitt had committed a serious non-political crime. The Board considered all the mitigating and aggravating factors, as required under <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Board reasonably decided that Ms. Profitt was excluded from refugee protection under Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n.\n\n[27]\nThe Respondent further submits that the Board considered all the evidence adduced by Ms. Profitt and determined that she had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection in Guyana with clear and convincing evidence (see\nWard,\ncited above;\nCanada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above). This test is not met merely because an applicant is able to demonstrate that state cannot provide perfect protection to its citizens. Rather, the proper test is whether the protection is adequate.\n\n[28]\nThe Board, according to the Respondent, is also presumed to have weighed all the evidence and is not required to mention or refer to particular passages from adverse documentary evidence (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 16-17). The Respondent submits that, in this case, the Board weighed all the evidence and reasonably determined that state protection is adequate in Guyana.\nVI. Analysis\n1. Did the Board provide sufficient reasons for its exclusion of Ms. Profitt under section 98 of the IRPA?\n\n[29]\nMs. Profitt argues that the Board failed to provide sufficient reasons explaining why she was excluded from seeking refugee protection in Canada under section 98 of\nIRPA\n.\n\n[30]\nIn\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Supreme Court of Canada held that \"[i]t is true that the breach of a duty of procedural fairness is an error in law. Where there are no reasons in circumstances where they are required, there is nothing to review. But where, as here, there are reasons, there is no such breach. Any challenge to the reasoning/result of the decision should therefore be made within the reasonableness analysis\". In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, at para 47, the Supreme Court wrote these often quoted comments: \"in judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\". Sufficient reasons must be given to enable the reviewing Court to determine whether or not a decision-maker erred (see\nVia rail  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 19). It is the Court's duty to review the decision and determine whether or not it falls within the range of possible and acceptable outcomes.\n\n[31]\nThe Board did not provide adequate reasons explaining why Ms. Profitt was excluded from refugee protection. The Board only stated that \"Minister's counsel has persuaded me, on a balance of probabilities, that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant has committed a \"serious non-political crime\"\" (see para 19 of the Board's decision). It also mentioned that \"Minister's counsel has persuaded me that the claimant's 2006 falsifying business records crime in the U.S. falls within the definition of \"serious criminality\" in the\nIRPA\n, and is therefore sufficient in itself to trigger a rebuttable presumption that the claimant has committed a crime that falls within the meaning of \"serious non-political crime\" under Article 1F(b) of the Convention\" (see para 20 of the Board's decision).\n\n[32]\nWhile some reasons were provided by the Board, the Court concludes that they are insufficient in that the Board failed to conduct the proper analysis and apply the appropriate test, as required by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, at para 44, or properly weigh the mitigating evidence adduced by Ms. Profitt.\n2. Did the Board err in excluding Ms. Profitt from refugee protection by concluding that she had committed serious non-political crimes under Article 1F(b) of the Convention?\n\n[33]\nThe adequacy of reasons is fundamental in determining whether a decision-maker has properly applied the jurisprudence or the law to the facts of the case. In this instance, the Board did not apply the required criteria in order to determine if Ms. Profitt's crimes were serious enough to attract Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n.\n\n[34]\nIn paragraph 44 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, the Federal Court of Appeal wrote: \"I believe there is a consensus among the courts that the interpretation of the exclusion clause in Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n, as regards the seriousness of a crime, requires an evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction\". Even though the Board considered Ms. Profitt's past abuse as a mitigating factor, it still concluded that is was not sufficient to rebut the serious non-political crime presumption. However, no evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution and the penalty prescribed were made by the Board. It is just not enough to make plain remarks on the criminal history of an Applicant.\n\n[35]\nFurthermore, the Board failed to assess the circumstances surrounding the crime. Ms. Profitt had suffered years of physical, sexual and mental abuse. Several medical reports were adduced before the Board to demonstrate Ms. Profitt's medical condition and its relation to years of exploitation and mistreatment. Dr. Celeste Thirlwell evaluated Ms. Profitt and found that she\"developed many symptoms which are consistent with Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)\" (see page 73 of the Applicant's Record, Volume I). Another report by Dr. Linda Weber reveals that \"Ms. Profitt suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Episodes. From August 2009-May 2010 she was seen 9 times by Dr. Meador with concerns of worsening suicidal ideation, nightmares, flashbacks, hypervigilance and anxiety. Dr. Meador was very concerned about her health and well-being and arranged an urgent psychiatric consultation with Dr. Gotlib\" (see page 78 of the Applicant's record, Volume I). Dr. Les Richmond performed a complete physical assessment of Ms. Profitt and concluded that she had sustained several injuries consistent with her history of physical abuse.\n\n[36]\nAccording to Dr. Thirlwell's evaluation, \"the crimes she committed in the United States were not premeditated or meant to cause harm. They were examples of her maladaptive way of seeking help\"(see page 77 of the Applicant's Record, Volume I). Even though Ms. Profitt committed crimes in the US, the above factors were not properly assessed or were simply ignored by the Board. Failure to follow the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> doctrine gives rise to a reviewable error.\n\n[37]\nThe Court having concluded in favour of Ms. Profitt on the first two issues there is no need to proceed to an analysis with respect to the issue of adequacy of state protection in Guyana.\nVII. Conclusion\n\n[38]\nThe Board has failed to provide give adequate reasons as to why it concluded that Ms. Profitt was excluded under Article 1F(\nb\n) of the\nConvention\n, and to follow the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> doctrine. Therefore, this application for judicial review is allowed.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[39]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n1. This application for judicial review is allowed; and\n2. There is no question of general importance to certify.\nAnnex\nSections 96, 97 and 98 of the\nImmigration and refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001 [\nIRPA\n] read as follows\n:\nConvention refugee\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\nPerson in need of protection\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nPerson in need of protection\n(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.\nExclusion - Refugee Convention\n98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nArticle 1F(b) of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees reads as follows:\n1F(\nb\n) He has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Scott\n[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée par Annetta Profitt (Mme Profitt) en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001 [la LIPR], de la décision du 6 juillet 2011 par laquelle la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait ni qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention conformément à l'article 96, ni celle de personne à protéger au sens des articles 97 et 98 de la LIPR.",
