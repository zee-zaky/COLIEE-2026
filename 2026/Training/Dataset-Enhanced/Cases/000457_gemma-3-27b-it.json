    "[1]\nMacKay, J.\n: This application by the plaintiffs, filed September 2, 1993, originally sought leave for the matter to be heard that same day and an order pursuant to rule 469 for an interim and an interlocutory injunction until trial of the action, which was commenced by statement of claim filed September 20, 1991. The injunction sought would restrain the defendant, its officers, servants, agents and associated, subsidiary or affiliated corporations from:\n\"(a) further infringing Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349; and\n\"(b) manufacturing, importing, exporting, selling or offering for sale in Canada or from Canada, any enalapril, enalapril maleate in bulk or tablet form in violation of the rights granted under Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349;\"\nor in the alternative, the plaintiff seeks an order\n\"that the defendant keep an account of all enalapril (and enalapril maleate) from time to time in its possession, custody or power ... and furnish to the plaintiff ... monthly statements of its manufactures, purchases and sales and inventory of enalapril and enalapril maleate whether in bulk or tablet form.\"",
    "[2]\nLeave was granted for the matter to be heard on short notice and on September 2, after hearing counsel for the parties, on consent, the application was adjourned to September 24, when it was heard in relation to the application for an interlocutory injunction. At the adjournment terms agreed upon required the defendant to maintain records of sales of enalapril maleate in bulk or dosage form until further order of the court.\nThe Background",
    "[3]\nThe plaintiff, Merck & Co. Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), is a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in the United States. It is said to be the largest innovative pharmaceutical company in the world. It is the owner of Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349, issued on October 16, 1990, which contains claims to the compounds enalapril and enalapril maleate (collectively, \"enalapril\") among others, to pharmaceutical compositions of enalapril, and to use of certain of the compounds and the pharmaceutical compositions as an anti-hypertensive. Merck Frosst Canada Inc. (\"Merck Frosst\"), a Canadian company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck. It is said to be the leading pharmaceutical company in Canada in terms of sales, and it has the largest private pharmaceutical research program in Canada, spending some $47 million on research in 1992, a figure in excess of 10 per cent to its annual revenues. Merck Frosst is the exclusive licensee under the patent, at least for Canada.",
    "[4]\nEnalapril and enalapril maleate are generic names for compounds developed from research done in an extensive program for synthetic chemical development undertaken by Merck U.S. Through its division known as Merck Sharp & Dohme, Merck Frosst markets enalapril maleate in tablet form in Canada under the trademark \"Vasotec\" in four different strengths and in an injectable form. Since 1987, and until September 2, 1993, Merck Frosst has been the only company in Canada which held a Notice of Compliance (\"NOC\") from the Minister of National Health and Welfare for the manufacture and sale of enalapril in Canada. Its sales of the product \"Vasotec\" are most important to Merck Frosst, now accounting for about one-third of its annual sales revenues. As we will note, as a result of judicial proceedings, on September 2 the Minister issued a notice or notices of compliance to Apotex relating to its three strengths of \"Apo-Enalapril\", its generic products comparable to Merck Frosst's \"Vasotec\" product. An NOC is required for marketing of a prescription drug for human consumption in Canada.",
    "[5]\n\"Vasotec\" is now the most often prescribed drug for treating hypertension in Canada and it also has a dominant position in the treatment of congestive heart failure. More than 370,000 Canadian patients now use \"Vasotec\" prescriptions. \"Vasotec\" competes with several other drugs for the treatment of hypertension but it is now said to be the prescription drug with the highest value of sales in Canada. Its annual market has grown at a rapid rate, with sales in excess of $120 million in 1992 and sales forecast at $150 million in 1993.",
    "[6]\nThe defendant, Apotex Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) is a Canadian company incorporated in Ontario, carrying on business as a manufacturer and distributor of generic pharmaceutical products. It is the largest producer of generic prescription drugs in Canada, manufacturing and selling drugs invented by others. Apotex has never applied for and has never held a license, compulsory or otherwise, from Merck to import, manufacture or sell enalapril for use or consumption in Canada or elsewhere.",
    "[7]\nApotex claims that it commenced development of its version of enalapril maleate in 1987 and that substantial quantities of enalapril maleate in bulk as raw material were acquired in 1989 and 1990, prior to the issuance of the Merck Canadian patent on October 16, 1990. Apotex claims to have invested tens of millions of dollars for new facilities in its corporate growth and development programs based, at least in large part, upon anticipated returns to be realized from sales of its product \"Apo-Enalapril\", and other products.",
    "[8]\nIn February 1990, Apotex applied to the Health Protection Branch of the Department of National Health and Welfare for an NOC to market its version of enalapril maleate under the trademark \"Apo-Enalapril\" and it had anticipated obtaining an NOC by the end of 1992. By the latter half of 1992, Apotex had manufactured several million \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets, bearing an expiry date of two years from the date of manufacture. The compound, enalapril maleate, in bulk form is said to be very stable for an indefinite period provided it is maintained under particular conditions. In tablet form it has a much reduced shelf life.",
    "[9]\nIn March 1991, Merck became aware that enalapril tablets, not of Merck origin, were appearing in the Caribbean Islands. Those tablets were traced to the defendant and in May 1991, Merck obtained three sample bottles of \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets in the 5 mg., 10 mg., and 20 mg. dosage forms, produced by Apotex in Toronto. Apotex's \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets are generally similar in size, shape, colour and concentration of the drug to corresponding \"Vasotec\" tablets of Merck Canada. Chemical analysis of the Apotex products by Merck staff in August and September 1991 resulted in a report that identified the presence in those products of enalapril maleate of the chemical composition set out in at least claim 4 of the Merck patent, which claims the enalapril maleate product. The tablets containing that compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are considered by Merck to infringe at least claim 10 of the Canadian patent. That claim relates to \"a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising an effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of [enalapril] in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\". The report of Merck's staff also indicated that the 5 mg. tablet of Apotex demonstrated degradation due to instability.\nLegal Proceedings To Date",
    "[10]\nOn September 20, 1991, the plaintiffs commenced this action against Apotex for alleged infringement of the Merck patent, alleging the importation, manufacture, use and sale in Canada and to Caribbean countries of enalapril and enalapril maleate, and the application by Apotex for an NOC in respect of its product \"Apo-Enalapril\" with which it was said to be conducting clinical trials in Canada. Apotex filed a defence and counterclaim in this action in November 1991, denying infringement of the Merck patent, and denying that application had been made for an NOC. Apotex claims that the enalapril maleate used in its tablets was manufactured in Canada prior to the issuance of Merck's patent and thus, in using that product, Apotex was not infringing, by virtue of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n. The counterclaim by Apotex seeks a declaration that certain claims of the Merck patent, claims 8 to 17, are invalid. On February 6, 1992 the plaintiffs filed a reply to the defence and a defence to the counterclaim. On January 21, 1993 Merck applied for an order for inspection and for delivery by Apotex of samples of \"Apo-Enalapril\" for testing by Merck, a motion adjourned and still pending. There was no further activity in relation to the action until this application, presented on short notice on September 2, 1993. In the meantime, however, there have been a number of developments of significance in the relations between the parties.",
    "[11]\nIn May 1992, the plaintiffs commenced a second action against certain companies associated with Apotex, and Mr. Bernard Sherman, the President and Chief Directing Officer of the defendant, claiming infringement of the Merck patent in relation to \"Vasotec\" by manufacture and sale by mail order of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product of Apotex. Apotex itself was subsequently joined as a defendant in that action.",
    "[12]\nThroughout 1992 and early 1993 Merck and other pharmaceutical companies involved Apotex and others in proceedings in the United States that apparently resulted in regulatory orders prohibiting the sale in the United States, through mail order arrangements, by companies located outside the U.S., of drug products not specifically authorized for sale in that country. Those proceedings are not relevant to the issues here considered.",
    "[13]\nOn December 22, 1992, Apotex brought an application in this court for judicial review, seeking an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the Minister of National Health and Welfare to issue NOCs, for which it had applied, for a number of its products, including \"Apo-Enalapril\".",
    "[14]\nOn January 5, 1993, this court dismissed an application by Apotex and others to enjoin Parliament from enacting Bill C-91 which included proposed amendments to the\nPatent Act\nin relation to prescription drug products [see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Those amendments, subsequently enacted as S.C. 1993, c. 2, changed the arrangements under the former regime for compulsory licensing, and they extend patent protection to 20 years, in a manner that may significantly assist pharmaceutical companies engaged in research, development, and marketing of original drug products. On the same day the injunction application was dismissed, a television news report on the matter included film footage of what appeared to be the interior of an Apotex warehouse in which the product \"Apo-Enalapril\" is shown along with a sign stating \"10 mg, 100, exp. 5/95, V8440\" and \"For Export\". Thereafter, as earlier noted, the plaintiffs brought a motion for an order for inspection of Apotex premises in respect of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product shown on the national news report, a motion adjourned and still pending before this court.",
    "[15]\nOn February 4, 1993, the\nPatent Act Amendment Act, 1992\nformerly Bill C-91, was given Royal Assent. Most of its statutory provisions were proclaimed in force on February 15, 1993, but s. 55.2 of the\nAct\n, which provides for regulation-making authority, and regulations thereunder, were proclaimed only as of March 12, 1993. The\nPatented Medicine (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\nthen enacted have significantly changed procedures for obtaining an NOC, essentially prohibiting the Minister from granting one in any case where there are existing product and use patents, which are to be valid for 20 years, pertaining to the same drug as is the subject matter of the application for an NOC.",
    "[16]\nOn February 22, 1993, Merck filed an application for an order of prohibition to prohibit the Minister issuing an NOC to Apotex. On March 4, Apotex applied by motion for an order directing that an NOC or NOCs be issued for \"Apo-Enalapril\". On March 18, both the Merck and Apotex applications were ordered to be consolidated for hearing.",
    "[17]\nThe applications by Apotex to compel, and by Merck to prohibit, the Minister of Health and Welfare to issue an NOC in relation to \"Apo-Enalapril\" were heard by my colleague Mr. Justice Dubé on June 21 and 22, 1993. On July 16, for reasons then filed, he ordered that the Minister issue the NOC sought by Apotex and he dismissed the application by Merck for prohibition [see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].",
    "[18]\nThe following day, July 17, on short notice, Merck applied to Mr. Justice Gibson of this court for an order to stay the order of Mr. Justice Dubé pending an appeal by Merck from the latter's decision. An interim stay was granted, pending hearing of the application on July 23 and until the matter was disposed of. On July 27 Mr. Justice Gibson granted an order staying the order of Dubé, J., pending determination of the appeal which by then was initiated by Merck against the decision of Dubé, J. From that order of Mr. Justice Gibson, Apotex appealed. On August 31 and September 1 the Court of Appeal heard both the Merck appeal and the appeal by Apotex. It reserved decision in relation to the appeal by Merck but on September 1, Mahoney, J.A., for the court, allowed the Apotex appeal. He found that the motions judge had erred in basing his order on the ground that Merck's appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Dubé would be rendered moot or nugatory. That decision, setting aside the stay order of Mr. Justice Gibson, set the stage for this application, originally brought on short notice on the following day, September 2.",
    "[19]\nOn September 1, a further news report on national television showed film footage of what appeared to be the interior of an Apotex warehouse, including apparently large quantities of packaged \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets ready for shipment. The news report included an interview with Mr. Sherman who stated that \"Apo-Enalapril\" would be available at 20 per cent below the price of the Merck product.",
    "[20]\nFollowing the decision of the Court of Appeal, on September 2, 1993, the Minister issued to Apotex an NOC or NOCs for \"Apo-Enalapril\". On that same day this application was first heard and adjourned for hearing in relation to an interlocutory injunction on September 24th.",
    "[21]\nIn the meantime, following the issue of the NOC, Apotex had commenced its plans for selling \"Apo-Enalapril\", including applications to be listed in all provincial drug formularies, except British Columbia where no such listing is required. In the other provinces that listing is required at least in relation to authorized substitution of a generic product for a prescribed drug, and formularies are published about every six months, in January and June. The market for a generic product, like \"Apo-Enalapril\", is dependant upon its lower price than the original prescribed drug and provincial regulations for substitution of listed generic drugs. Apotex anticipates that, as the first generic producer in the market of this important drug product, its sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" will soon grow to $50 million per year, a significant portion of the total market developed by Merck Frosst for \"Vasotec\".",
    "[22]\nOne further factor of some significance in this case is the nature of the action initiated September 1991. Counsel for both parties were agreed that on the basis of the evidence thus far adduced there appear to be narrow issues to be resolved in the action. They concern essentially the application of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\nupon which Apotex relies in part for its defence, and the validity of the patent's claim for combining enalapril maleate with a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising enalapril maleate in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, primarily claim 10. In view of the limited issues counsel for both parties were agreed that preparations for trial would not require more than a few months and, if the court could accommodate them, the matter might be heard as early as February or March 1994, provided an agreed timetable for preparation could be arranged under the court's supervision. Thus, in terms of a normal patent infringement action, the time for an interlocutory injunction to apply, should one be awarded, or the time for possible damages to the plaintiff if one should not be awarded, is minimal. Both parties affirmed a mutual interest in having trial and resolution of the issues as quickly as possible.\nThe Issues",
    "[23]\nThis application raises two principal issues and two others of subordinate importance. The first principal issue is whether this court should consider the application at all, in circumstances which the defendant describes as raising an issue of estoppel or abuse of process in that my colleague Mr. Justice Gibson has already determined that the plaintiffs have not established they will suffer irreparable harm on evidence in essence similar to that here presented. If the application is to be considered, the second principal issue is whether the plaintiffs here establish they will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not awarded, or, in the terms urged by the plaintiffs, whether on weighing the balance of convenience an injunction should issue. The other issues, in my view subordinate, relate to matters to be considered in assessing the balance of convenience between the parties, and ultimately the court's exercise of discretion. The first is, what is the status quo that should be preserved by issue or denial of an injunction, and the second is whether the plaintiffs have so delayed in seeking interlocutory relief that the court should decline to consider an injunction at this time. Neither of these issues needs to be finally determined unless the plaintiffs are persuasive for other reasons that an interlocutory injunction should be seriously considered.\nIssue Estoppel Or Abuse Of Process",
    "[24]\nIn his reasons for order in staying the order of July 16 directed to the Minister to issue an NOC to Apotex, my colleague Mr. Justice Gibson considered the evidence before him of irreparable harm claimed by Merck. He concluded that this was not established, except insofar as the appeal by Merck would be rendered moot or nugatory and on that ground he ordered the stay pending disposition of the appeal (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). He said at pp. 250-251:\n\"I find that there is no doubt on the face of the material before me that Merck has a major economic interest in protecting its exclusive market in Canada for the drug in question and that its exclusive position would be put at risk in the long term if the Minister were to issue an NOC to Apotex. The damages that Merck would suffer are somewhat speculative and would turn at least in part on the strength of its patent protection. Some elements of the damages might be very difficult to calculate but the major elements flowing from market loss would not be. In any event, I am not satisfied the harm would be such that it would be difficult to compensate in damages, to use again the words of Beetz, J.\n. . . . .\n\"I find that on the facts of this case, if no stay is granted and the Minister complies with the mandamus order, as she or he undoubtedly would, Merck's appeal, as it relates to the denial of prohibition, would be rendered nugatory. I find this result to constitute irreparable harm, that meets the test set out by Beetz, J., in\nMetropolitan Stores\n, that is harm not susceptible or difficult to be compensable in damages. On this basis, the second element of the test is met.\"",
    "[25]\nIn allowing the appeal by Apotex from the stay order granted by Gibson, J., Mr. Justice Mahoney stated (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)):\n\"We are all of the opinion that the learned trial judge erred in deciding that the appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Dubé made July 16, 1993, directing that a notice of compliance be issued in respect of a certain drug, would be rendered moot or nugatory unless stayed. If the appeal is allowed, the order will be set aside and the notice of compliance quashed. Since the trial judge found, correctly in our view, that issuance of the notice of compliance would not result in irreparable harm, it follows that he erred in principle in staying the order of Dubé, J.\"",
    "[26]\nThe defendant submits that Mr. Justice Gibson, on the stay application, has previously considered the question of irreparable harm fully in proceedings involving the same parties, on virtually the same evidence as is adduced in this application, and he found that irreparable harm had not been demonstrated. That finding was expressly endorsed by the Court of Appeal. Thus, the defendant submits that given that the legal issue of irreparable harm is the same, it would be highly inappropriate for this court to consider the submissions anew and come to a conclusion which would reverse the court's previous finding, especially in view of the endorsement by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff should be estopped from raising the matter again. Raising the issue again is an abuse of the court's process and the application should be dismissed.",
    "[27]\nIn my opinion, while it is true that the tests are the same for a stay as for an interlocutory injunction, this court has the obligation to consider the evidence adduced which is not entirely the same as that before Mr. Justice Gibson. Affidavits of the principal affiants on behalf of the plaintiffs are said to be substantially the same as affidavits relied upon in the proceedings before Gibson, J., but in my view, while they are similar, they are not the same. The defendant's affiants have been examined on their affidavits, adding to the evidence before me. Moreover, the memorandum of argument in support of the stay application does not deal with all of the evidence or all of the arguments addressed to me. Thus, I am not persuaded that the evidence in this case is identical to that which was before Mr. Justice Gibson. Moreover, the proceedings for a stay involved Merck's rights in relation to an order directed to the Minister before an NOC issued to Apotex, a situation different from that in these proceedings, after issue of an NOC, concerning the rights of private parties inter se in relation to intellectual property rights claimed under a registered patent.",
    "[28]\nI conclude that the previous finding of Gibson, J., endorsed by the Court of Appeal, that in the application for a stay the plaintiffs did not establish they would suffer irreparable harm if the NOC were issued, is not determinative of the issues and arguments here raised and the plaintiffs are not to be barred in seeking relief by the principle of issue estoppel.\nThe Threshold - A Serious Issue",
    "[29]\nIt is now well settled that for this court the test or standard for assessing whether an interlocutory injunction should issue is that set out by Stone, J.A., for the Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1, at pp. 18-20 (F.C.A.). Sometimes described as a tripartite test, Stone, J.A., at p. 20 (C.P.R.), in fact listed several factors to be considered and emphasized that these factors \"do not constitute a series of mechanical steps that are to be followed in some sort of drilled progression ... considerable flexibility is called for, bearing in mind that the balance of convenience is of paramount importance\". Treating the factors to be considered in a flexible manner, as a multi-requisite test for assessing the balance of convenience was also endorsed as appropriate, at least in relation to the law of British Columbia, by Madame Justice McLachlin, then of the B.C. Court of Appeal, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 213-215 (B.C.C.A.), appeal dismissed (1991), 120 N.R. 208 (S.C.C.). The ultimate question in each case is whether it is just and equitable in all the circumstances that an interlocutory injunction, an extraordinary remedy, should be granted [see footnote 1].",
    "[30]\nAcknowledging that the factors to be considered should be flexibly assessed, the threshold requirement for the applicant to establish is that there is a serious issue in the sense that the action is neither frivolous nor vexatious.",
    "[31]\nI am satisfied that the plaintiffs' action does raise serious issues that, absent settlement between the parties, can only be resolved by a trial. The plaintiffs claim on their investigation of the defendant's \"Apo-Enalapril\" product, that the defendants infringe their rights under Canadian patent 1,275,349 and that the defence relied on in large part by the defendant, s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n, properly construed, does not extend to protect the activities of the defendant in this case. The defendant urges that its activities are within the scope of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n[see footnote 2] and that moreover claims of the patent, in particular claim 10 in relation to the tablet form, is invalid. Essentially the defence is that under s. 56, the bulk product obtained by Apotex prior to the issue of Merck's patent could be used in the only manner that product could be used, i.e., by incorporation in pharmaceutical tablets, and those tablets are not an infringement of the patent since its claim to the use of the drug compound combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is not a valid claim. In light of these defences Apotex urges that in view of the pleadings in this case there is not a serious issue before the court, or at best the plaintiffs' case is a weak one.",
    "[32]\nAt this stage, pending full opportunity for those issues to be addressed at trial, there can be no doubt that there are serious issues before the court and the threshold test is met by the plaintiffs.\nIrreparable Harm And The\nBalance Of Convenience",
    "[33]\nIt is urged by plaintiffs that this is not simply a routine case of alleged infringement, rather it concerns infringement of patent rights to the leading prescription drug in dollar terms in Canada, a drug widely recognized for its therapeutic qualities and widely used by thousands of persons who have come to rely on the plaintiffs as the source of supply. It has most significant value in the goodwill of the plaintiffs. Where there is doubt as to the adequacy of the remedy in damages if the plaintiffs are successful at trial, it is urged that in considering an interlocutory injunction the court must consider the balance of convenience to the parties, if an injunction be granted or denied at this stage (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1975] 1 All E.R. 504 (H.L.), per Lord Diplock at p. 408). Doubt as to the adequacy of damages must relate to harm perceived to the plaintiff, or to the defendant, but for this court it is established that harm may not be merely speculative (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 129 (F.C.A.), per Heald, J.A., at p. 135).",
    "[34]\nHere it is urged that there is doubt as to the adequacy of damages as a remedy for the plaintiffs in the event they are successful at trial and their position is not now protected by an interlocutory injunction. Loss, or harm, is predicated on the anticipated loss to Merck Frosst of a minimum of 50% of its market for \"Vasotec\" once the Apotex \"Apo-Enalapril\" is added to provincial drug formularies, resulting in devastating loss of sales for Merck Frosst. Moreover, the value of its goodwill will be seriously affected by loss of its market advantage as the only supplier of the most valuable, in sales terms, prescription drug in Canada. It is said its reputation as a leading innovator in the pharmaceutical field will also be adversely affected. Both its goodwill and its reputation, it is said, are at risk in view of potential harm that could arise with consumers of the Apotex tablets whose origin, age, shelf life and stability are unknown but which are identical in colour, size, shape and concentration to the plaintiffs' \"Vasotec\" brand. In my view, potential harm of this last sort cannot be more than speculative, given the issue of an NOC to Apotex authorizing sale of its product for consumption in Canada after satisfactory assessment of its safety and efficacy by the Health Protection Branch on behalf of the Minister of Health and Welfare. Moreover, I am not persuaded that Apotex entry into the market for the drug in question will adversely affect the plaintiffs' reputation as a leading innovator in the pharmaceutical field. Important as this drug may be, the plaintiffs and defendant already are in competition in the market for other drugs without apparent adverse effect upon the plaintiffs' reputation. The entry of a generic producer into the market does not in itself adversely affect the reputation of the innovator whose product has become the model for the generic product.",
    "[35]\nLoss of market share and profits for Merck Frosst will, it is urged, result in harm to the plaintiffs in several respects. Some of these, in my opinion, are speculative. Thus I would class the plaintiffs' concerns that Merck Frosst's competitiveness will be reduced, not only in relation to \"Vasotec\" but also its other products, because of higher production costs, and that loss of substantial market share will result in layoff of employees  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Frosst's plant at Kirkland, Quebec, or in the reduction of current or projected levels of medical research it conducts. The plaintiffs express concern that loss of market share will not be recoverable, if an injunction is not now granted and the plaintiffs succeed at trial, because improved antihypertensive agents are being developed which will challenge the leadership of the \"Vasotec\" product but that, in my opinion, if it occurs, will be the result of new products in the market rather than entry of the defendant into the market with its \"Apo-Enalapril\".",
    "[36]\nThese concerns are merely speculative for another reason, in my view. At best they relate to long-term implications of Apotex's entry into the market, not to effects to be realized in the interim pending trial, if the parties are indeed determined to bring this action to trial without delay. As noted, counsel agreed that if trial dates can be arranged the action could be tried as early as some five or six months hence. Counsel for Apotex acknowledges that the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product will make little impact in the market in Canada until after publication of provincial formularies now anticipated for January 1994, so that its presence in the national market will be of significance only for a brief period before an early trial.",
    "[37]\nThe plaintiffs also urge that the value of Merck's patent as an asset will be severely reduced by the entry of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" in the market. I am not persuaded this is a factor to be considered at this stage since if that were to occur it would result from trial of the action upholding the defences advanced by Apotex and denying the claims of the plaintiffs. If the Apotex defences and counterclaim are not accepted at trial the value of the Merck patent as an asset will not be seriously reduced by any brief period of active sales in the market by Apotex between now and trial, assuming the parties are serious in having this action tried as quickly as possible. If Apotex is out of the market as a result of the trial the value of the patent as an asset, for the plaintiffs' ongoing operations or for purposes of licensing others, would be unaffected.",
    "[38]\nFinally, it is urged that permitting Apotex to sell its product would be contrary to the public policy of Canada established by the\nPatent Act Amendment Act, 1992\nand the\nPatent Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n. It is suggested that under the arrangements prevailing until February 1993, when that\nAct\ncame into force, the earliest date for any generic producer to have received a compulsory license was 1994, and that Apotex has simply taken advantage of a change in arrangements for compulsory licensing. The argument, in my view, assumes validity of the patent and a particular interpretation of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n, and that the defences raised by Apotex will not be accepted at trial. At this stage, on an interlocutory application, the court cannot prejudge those issues.",
    "[39]\nFor Apotex it is urged that if an interlocutory injunction is granted and is found at trial to be unwarranted, it would suffer irreparable harm not adequately compensated by an award of damages. That harm would be occasioned by delay in its access to the market and potential loss to its position as the first generic producer in the market for enalapril maleate products. If an injunction were now awarded it would have to withdraw its requests for listing in provincial formularies and even with an early trial date if it is then found that an injunction is not warranted it would not manage to be listed in those publications before January 1995 at the earliest, in view of the lead time required for application for listing in advance of publication. Much or all of its product now in tablet form would have to be destroyed in view of its relatively short shelf life. Moreover, loss of its significant position as the first generic producer in the market could not be compensated in damages, an argument which the plaintiffs' claim supports their position as the first, and until September 2, 1993, the only holder of an NOC for sale of enalapril maleate products for sale in the Canadian market.",
    "[40]\nApotex also claims an injunction would cause irreparable harm in that its substantial investment in growth and development of the company, in new plant and added specialized staff, would be in jeopardy. While that investment may not have been based on anticipated returns from sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" alone, those anticipated returns are even more significant than originally contemplated for the enactment of\nPatent Act\namendments and new regulations postpones opportunity for production of other products contemplated under compulsory licenses for which it expected to successfully apply. The plaintiffs urge that such argument not be considered for Apotex entered into its program to develop \"Apo-Enalapril\" with its eyes open, well knowing that the plaintiffs' product was subject to patent rights. In my view, the claim of Apotex to potential harm in this respect, i.e., the impact on its combined activities of loss of cash flow from sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" if those be enjoined pending trial, can only be classed as speculative at best. It is a substantial company, just as the plaintiffs are. In my view, neither of them is likely to be adversely affected in their overall corporate arrangements, pending trial, whatever the outcome of this application may be.",
    "[41]\nThere is one further general argument raised by Apotex that in my view has significance. This is that the nature of the market for enalapril finished drugs is dependent upon the plaintiffs' program of educating prescribing physicians about the advantages of \"Vasotec\" for the conditions for which it is used as treatment. That is how the market as a whole is developed and maintained. That market, overall, is not likely to be affected by the entry of Apotex products for the defendant relies upon its promotion to pharmacists, not physicians, and upon provincial drug substitution programs. Since only the plaintiffs' product and that of Apotex will be in the market, any advantage of Apotex will be dependent upon the plaintiffs' willingness to compete in pricing their product. Any success Apotex may achieve in developing a share in the market, it is conceded by the defendant's counsel, will be at the expense of the plaintiffs' market share, and that can easily be accounted for between now and trial of the action.",
    "[42]\nI am not persuaded that, in the circumstances of this case the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm between now and trial of the action, that is, harm that will not be adequately compensated in damages. While assessing compensation may not be easy in all respects, mere difficulty in precisely calculating damages does not constitute harm that is not adequately compensable in damages, and it is sufficient that there be some reasonably accurate way of measuring them (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 55 (F.C.A.)).",
    "[43]\nCounsel for both parties cited numerous authorities. I propose to briefly refer only to those relied upon by plaintiffs as instances where harm of the sort here claimed in certain respects has been previously recognized.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 459 (T.D.) my colleague Madame Justice Reed granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting comparative advertising using a competitor's trademark and trade name associated with services where the focus of the advertising was the goodwill of the competitor's business. That is a very different situation than is here presented, that is, the plaintiffs' claim that the entry of Apotex into the market will adversely affect the goodwill generally, as a business asset, of the plaintiffs. In my view, any effect of the nature here claimed would merely be the result of competition, and adverse effect upon the goodwill of the plaintiffs cannot be said to be the focus or main purpose of Apotex in producing and selling \"Apo-Enalapril\". Indeed the plaintiffs claim, and Apotex concedes, its primary purpose in so doing is simply to make money.",
    "[44]\nDamage to a plaintiff's reputation has been accepted as a basis warranting an interim injunction pending hearing of the matter in an action alleging infringement of patent rights and passing off (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.)), and it has also been accepted as a basis for an interlocutory injunction in an action concerning trademarks where the plaintiff claimed confusion and an attempt by the defendant to profit from the goodwill and reputation established by the plaintiff's use of its trade name over some years (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 409 (T.D.)). In my opinion, the considerations relating to an interim injunction pending hearing of the matter are different from those to be assessed at the later hearing of the application for an interlocutory order. The considerations here raised are also different from those where a trade name is used for retail stores which name is alleged to be confusing with an established trademark name. In such a case the principle decision-makers determining the market are members of the public as consumers, whereas in this case the principle decision-makers determining the market are prescribing physicians, for the plaintiffs' product, and pharmacists and provincial regulations for the defendant's product. In my view, neither of the cases cited supports the plaintiffs' claim that harm to its general reputation arising solely from competition by Apotex should be recognized as harm for which damages at law might not be an adequate remedy.",
    "[45]\nLoss of market share or profit margin has been a factor in a finding that harm is not adequately compensated by damages, warranting an interlocutory injunction, in certain circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  injunction in circumstances he characterized as unique where the defendant had a long-standing contract to use the plaintiff's patented product and then proposed to bring to market its own product which was alleged to infringe the plaintiff's patent. There is no such contractual relationship between Apotex and Merck in this case. In\nCabot Corp. et al. v. 3M Canada Inc.\n(1987), 10 F.T.R. 210; 15 C.P.R.(3d) 247 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Joyal similarly granted an injunction pending trial of an action by a patent holder claiming infringement of its patented earplug product by the defendant who planned to introduce a competing product into the market, in circumstances where he found the factors affecting the parties' interests were evenly balanced and preserving the status quo by granting an injunction seemed warranted, following Lord Diplock in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1975] 1 All E.R. 504. In that case the status quo was considered to be the market situation at the time relief was sought, before the defendant entered the market. In my view, the circumstances before me differ. In\nCabot\nthe defendant's sales projections were minimal in relation to the total market and in relation to the defendant's total projected sales of all its products, and the defendant had not invested except in the inventory of the product provided by its U.S. parent. Here projected sales of Apotex are substantial; they are expected to attract a large share of the market, and they result from substantial capital investment by the defendant in a product which may, because of its relatively short shelf life, deteriorate and be of no value for sale if the defendant is enjoined from selling pending trial and then must await later listing in provincial drug formularies for some months after trial. In short, the stakes appear higher for the defendant Apotex, if an injunction should now issue, than they were for the defendant in\nCabot\n, and the plaintiffs' case here is not as strong as that of the plaintiff in that case, for there the plaintiff's patent had been upheld as valid in proceedings in Germany and it was ready to go to trial in this country in an unrelated action where validity of its Canadian patent would be determined.",
    "[46]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 493, Madame Justice Reed granted an interlocutory injunction in a case where she found clear evidence of infringement of patents for products in a market in a great state of flux. New industry standards indicated possible changes of significance in market share among competitors and business relationships established after adoption of new industry standards would have a long-term effect that could not easily be quantified. In such a case she found that monetary damages would not be adequate to remedy the harm arising from lost sales which resulted in a substantial loss of market share. Those circumstances, warranting an interlocutory injunction pending trial, are not present in the case at bar, in my view. The relative strengths of each party's case is here not so clearly determined at this stage, the market for the products here in issue is not subject to the same uncertainty as anticipated new industry standards presented in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and the market in this case will be served not from numerous sources but only by the plaintiffs if an injunction is granted, and if not, then by the two parties here involved. In the latter case, if no injunction issues, the plaintiffs' loss of market share and of sales will be readily calculable by sales made by the defendant who can be required to keep appropriate accounts pending trial.",
    "[47]\nIn my view, none of the cases referred to are definitive in determining that harm claimed by the plaintiffs may not be adequately compensated by damages following trial. Moreover, there are cases which support the conclusion that harm from loss of sales or profit margin and market share that may arise from sales of a generic brand of a pharmaceutical prescription product, which is substituted for the original brand because of lower prices, are readily quantifiable and adequately compensated by an award of damages [see footnote 3].",
    "[48]\nOne circumstance in this case, already referred to, relates to the harm anticipated by the plaintiffs if no injunction now issues. It is not unreasonable to expect trial of the action to be within six months. In that period Apotex's sales under provincial regulatory systems for drug substitution will have been made from September 1993 in British Columbia, but substantially only from January 1994 in all other provinces. In that time, in my view any loss in goodwill or reputation, if it be proven, can be compensated by damages, and loss of sales and market share can be calculated by reference to sales by Apotex, and loss of profits to the plaintiffs can be accounted for by adjusting those sales for the price differential between the products of the parties. If the plaintiffs succeed at trial in my opinion the harm suffered in the period pending trial will be adequately compensated by an appropriate award of damages.\nConclusion",
    "[49]\nI conclude, reflecting the words of Stone, J.A., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1, at p. 19, that the plaintiffs' recoverable damages resulting from continuance of the defendant's activities pending trial would be an adequate remedy. No question is raised about the defendant's ability to pay damages that may be awarded if the plaintiffs succeed at trial.",
    "[50]\nIn light of that conclusion other factors argued need not be determined. In particular, the defendant's concern that the plaintiffs have delayed unduly in seeking injunctive relief is only relevant if I were persuaded that an injunction should be seriously considered. If it were necessary to rule on that issue, it is my view that the plaintiffs have adequately explained why application was not earlier made in this action begun nearly two years ago, essentially because until the defendant had an NOC they had no authorization to see \"Apo-Enalapril\" in Canada and the case for claiming irreparable harm would have been even more difficult to make.",
    "[51]\nWere it necessary to resolve the differences between the parties as to the situation to be preserved if preservation of the status quo were a determining factor in this application, in my view the situation to be recognized is that urged by the defendant. That is that the defendants had commenced the process of seeking an NOC before the patent in issue was granted to the plaintiffs, its entitlement to an NOC has been determined by this court, and that notice has now been issued, subject only to reversal and cancellation of the NOC if the plaintiffs are successful in the appeal recently heard by the Court of Appeal. (See generally,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 129, at pp. 138-139.) In these circumstances preservation of the status quo would support the conclusion that an interlocutory injunction pending trial should not issue.",
    "[52]\nWhile I decline to grant relief by an injunction pending trial, the alternative relief claimed in the plaintiffs' application, while it was not argued at the hearing, is entirely appropriate. The defendant cannot seriously object to an order requiring the maintenance of appropriate records and accounts pending trial, just as it has been required to do since this application was first heard for interim relief on September 2, 1993 and then adjourned on terms.",
    "[53]\nAn order will go dismissing the plaintiffs' application for an interlocutory injunction pending trial, but allowing their application for an order that the defendant maintain records and accounts. Counsel for the parties are asked to consult on the terms of an order directing the maintenance of accounts and, if they can agree on terms by November 1, 1993, to submit those in form of a draft order consistent with these reasons, pursuant to rule 324(1). If the terms are not agreed upon the court will of its own motion resolve those terms, taking into account any representations either party may wish to submit in writing.",
    "[54]\nFinally, with a view to exploring how trial of the action may be expedited and to consider the development of a schedule for pretrial preparations, if that be desirable, counsel are invited to arrange with the office of the Associate Chief Justice for a pretrial conference, by telephone conference call or by appearance.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Reginald W.

  "full_text": "[1]\nMacKay, J.\n: This application by the plaintiffs, filed September 2, 1993, originally sought leave for the matter to be heard that same day and an order pursuant to rule 469 for an interim and an interlocutory injunction until trial of the action, which was commenced by statement of claim filed September 20, 1991. The injunction sought would restrain the defendant, its officers, servants, agents and associated, subsidiary or affiliated corporations from:\n\"(a) further infringing Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349; and\n\"(b) manufacturing, importing, exporting, selling or offering for sale in Canada or from Canada, any enalapril, enalapril maleate in bulk or tablet form in violation of the rights granted under Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349;\"\nor in the alternative, the plaintiff seeks an order\n\"that the defendant keep an account of all enalapril (and enalapril maleate) from time to time in its possession, custody or power ... and furnish to the plaintiff ... monthly statements of its manufactures, purchases and sales and inventory of enalapril and enalapril maleate whether in bulk or tablet form.\"\n[2]\nLeave was granted for the matter to be heard on short notice and on September 2, after hearing counsel for the parties, on consent, the application was adjourned to September 24, when it was heard in relation to the application for an interlocutory injunction. At the adjournment terms agreed upon required the defendant to maintain records of sales of enalapril maleate in bulk or dosage form until further order of the court.\nThe Background\n[3]\nThe plaintiff, Merck & Co. Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), is a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in the United States. It is said to be the largest innovative pharmaceutical company in the world. It is the owner of Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349, issued on October 16, 1990, which contains claims to the compounds enalapril and enalapril maleate (collectively, \"enalapril\") among others, to pharmaceutical compositions of enalapril, and to use of certain of the compounds and the pharmaceutical compositions as an anti-hypertensive. Merck Frosst Canada Inc. (\"Merck Frosst\"), a Canadian company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck. It is said to be the leading pharmaceutical company in Canada in terms of sales, and it has the largest private pharmaceutical research program in Canada, spending some $47 million on research in 1992, a figure in excess of 10 per cent to its annual revenues. Merck Frosst is the exclusive licensee under the patent, at least for Canada.\n[4]\nEnalapril and enalapril maleate are generic names for compounds developed from research done in an extensive program for synthetic chemical development undertaken by Merck U.S. Through its division known as Merck Sharp & Dohme, Merck Frosst markets enalapril maleate in tablet form in Canada under the trademark \"Vasotec\" in four different strengths and in an injectable form. Since 1987, and until September 2, 1993, Merck Frosst has been the only company in Canada which held a Notice of Compliance (\"NOC\") from the Minister of National Health and Welfare for the manufacture and sale of enalapril in Canada. Its sales of the product \"Vasotec\" are most important to Merck Frosst, now accounting for about one-third of its annual sales revenues. As we will note, as a result of judicial proceedings, on September 2 the Minister issued a notice or notices of compliance to Apotex relating to its three strengths of \"Apo-Enalapril\", its generic products comparable to Merck Frosst's \"Vasotec\" product. An NOC is required for marketing of a prescription drug for human consumption in Canada.\n[5]\n\"Vasotec\" is now the most often prescribed drug for treating hypertension in Canada and it also has a dominant position in the treatment of congestive heart failure. More than 370,000 Canadian patients now use \"Vasotec\" prescriptions. \"Vasotec\" competes with several other drugs for the treatment of hypertension but it is now said to be the prescription drug with the highest value of sales in Canada. Its annual market has grown at a rapid rate, with sales in excess of $120 million in 1992 and sales forecast at $150 million in 1993.\n[6]\nThe defendant, Apotex Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) is a Canadian company incorporated in Ontario, carrying on business as a manufacturer and distributor of generic pharmaceutical products. It is the largest producer of generic prescription drugs in Canada, manufacturing and selling drugs invented by others. Apotex has never applied for and has never held a license, compulsory or otherwise, from Merck to import, manufacture or sell enalapril for use or consumption in Canada or elsewhere.\n[7]\nApotex claims that it commenced development of its version of enalapril maleate in 1987 and that substantial quantities of enalapril maleate in bulk as raw material were acquired in 1989 and 1990, prior to the issuance of the Merck Canadian patent on October 16, 1990. Apotex claims to have invested tens of millions of dollars for new facilities in its corporate growth and development programs based, at least in large part, upon anticipated returns to be realized from sales of its product \"Apo-Enalapril\", and other products.\n[8]\nIn February 1990, Apotex applied to the Health Protection Branch of the Department of National Health and Welfare for an NOC to market its version of enalapril maleate under the trademark \"Apo-Enalapril\" and it had anticipated obtaining an NOC by the end of 1992. By the latter half of 1992, Apotex had manufactured several million \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets, bearing an expiry date of two years from the date of manufacture. The compound, enalapril maleate, in bulk form is said to be very stable for an indefinite period provided it is maintained under particular conditions. In tablet form it has a much reduced shelf life.\n[9]\nIn March 1991, Merck became aware that enalapril tablets, not of Merck origin, were appearing in the Caribbean Islands. Those tablets were traced to the defendant and in May 1991, Merck obtained three sample bottles of \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets in the 5 mg., 10 mg., and 20 mg. dosage forms, produced by Apotex in Toronto. Apotex's \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets are generally similar in size, shape, colour and concentration of the drug to corresponding \"Vasotec\" tablets of Merck Canada. Chemical analysis of the Apotex products by Merck staff in August and September 1991 resulted in a report that identified the presence in those products of enalapril maleate of the chemical composition set out in at least claim 4 of the Merck patent, which claims the enalapril maleate product. The tablets containing that compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are considered by Merck to infringe at least claim 10 of the Canadian patent. That claim relates to \"a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising an effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of [enalapril] in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\". The report of Merck's staff also indicated that the 5 mg. tablet of Apotex demonstrated degradation due to instability.\nLegal Proceedings To Date\n[10]\nOn September 20, 1991, the plaintiffs commenced this action against Apotex for alleged infringement of the Merck patent, alleging the importation, manufacture, use and sale in Canada and to Caribbean countries of enalapril and enalapril maleate, and the application by Apotex for an NOC in respect of its product \"Apo-Enalapril\" with which it was said to be conducting clinical trials in Canada. Apotex filed a defence and counterclaim in this action in November 1991, denying infringement of the Merck patent, and denying that application had been made for an NOC. Apotex claims that the enalapril maleate used in its tablets was manufactured in Canada prior to the issuance of Merck's patent and thus, in using that product, Apotex was not infringing, by virtue of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n. The counterclaim by Apotex seeks a declaration that certain claims of the Merck patent, claims 8 to 17, are invalid. On February 6, 1992 the plaintiffs filed a reply to the defence and a defence to the counterclaim. On January 21, 1993 Merck applied for an order for inspection and for delivery by Apotex of samples of \"Apo-Enalapril\" for testing by Merck, a motion adjourned and still pending. There was no further activity in relation to the action until this application, presented on short notice on September 2, 1993. In the meantime, however, there have been a number of developments of significance in the relations between the parties.\n[11]\nIn May 1992, the plaintiffs commenced a second action against certain companies associated with Apotex, and Mr. Bernard Sherman, the President and Chief Directing Officer of the defendant, claiming infringement of the Merck patent in relation to \"Vasotec\" by manufacture and sale by mail order of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product of Apotex. Apotex itself was subsequently joined as a defendant in that action.\n[12]\nThroughout 1992 and early 1993 Merck and other pharmaceutical companies involved Apotex and others in proceedings in the United States that apparently resulted in regulatory orders prohibiting the sale in the United States, through mail order arrangements, by companies located outside the U.S., of drug products not specifically authorized for sale in that country. Those proceedings are not relevant to the issues here considered.\n[13]\nOn December 22, 1992, Apotex brought an application in this court for judicial review, seeking an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the Minister of National Health and Welfare to issue NOCs, for which it had applied, for a number of its products, including \"Apo-Enalapril\".\n[14]\nOn January 5, 1993, this court dismissed an application by Apotex and others to enjoin Parliament from enacting Bill C-91 which included proposed amendments to the\nPatent Act\nin relation to prescription drug products [see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Those amendments, subsequently enacted as S.C. 1993, c. 2, changed the arrangements under the former regime for compulsory licensing, and they extend patent protection to 20 years, in a manner that may significantly assist pharmaceutical companies engaged in research, development, and marketing of original drug products. On the same day the injunction application was dismissed, a television news report on the matter included film footage of what appeared to be the interior of an Apotex warehouse in which the product \"Apo-Enalapril\" is shown along with a sign stating \"10 mg, 100, exp. 5/95, V8440\" and \"For Export\". Thereafter, as earlier noted, the plaintiffs brought a motion for an order for inspection of Apotex premises in respect of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product shown on the national news report, a motion adjourned and still pending before this court.\n[15]\nOn February 4, 1993, the\nPatent Act Amendment Act, 1992\nformerly Bill C-91, was given Royal Assent. Most of its statutory provisions were proclaimed in force on February 15, 1993, but s. 55.2 of the\nAct\n, which provides for regulation-making authority, and regulations thereunder, were proclaimed only as of March 12, 1993. The\nPatented Medicine (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\nthen enacted have significantly changed procedures for obtaining an NOC, essentially prohibiting the Minister from granting one in any case where there are existing product and use patents, which are to be valid for 20 years, pertaining to the same drug as is the subject matter of the application for an NOC.\n[16]\nOn February 22, 1993, Merck filed an application for an order of prohibition to prohibit the Minister issuing an NOC to Apotex. On March 4, Apotex applied by motion for an order directing that an NOC or NOCs be issued for \"Apo-Enalapril\". On March 18, both the Merck and Apotex applications were ordered to be consolidated for hearing.\n[17]\nThe applications by Apotex to compel, and by Merck to prohibit, the Minister of Health and Welfare to issue an NOC in relation to \"Apo-Enalapril\" were heard by my colleague Mr. Justice Dubé on June 21 and 22, 1993. On July 16, for reasons then filed, he ordered that the Minister issue the NOC sought by Apotex and he dismissed the application by Merck for prohibition [see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n[18]\nThe following day, July 17, on short notice, Merck applied to Mr. Justice Gibson of this court for an order to stay the order of Mr. Justice Dubé pending an appeal by Merck from the latter's decision. An interim stay was granted, pending hearing of the application on July 23 and until the matter was disposed of. On July 27 Mr. Justice Gibson granted an order staying the order of Dubé, J., pending determination of the appeal which by then was initiated by Merck against the decision of Dubé, J. From that order of Mr. Justice Gibson, Apotex appealed. On August 31 and September 1 the Court of Appeal heard both the Merck appeal and the appeal by Apotex. It reserved decision in relation to the appeal by Merck but on September 1, Mahoney, J.A., for the court, allowed the Apotex appeal. He found that the motions judge had erred in basing his order on the ground that Merck's appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Dubé would be rendered moot or nugatory. That decision, setting aside the stay order of Mr. Justice Gibson, set the stage for this application, originally brought on short notice on the following day, September 2.\n[19]\nOn September 1, a further news report on national television showed film footage of what appeared to be the interior of an Apotex warehouse, including apparently large quantities of packaged \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets ready for shipment. The news report included an interview with Mr. Sherman who stated that \"Apo-Enalapril\" would be available at 20 per cent below the price of the Merck product.\n[20]\nFollowing the decision of the Court of Appeal, on September 2, 1993, the Minister issued to Apotex an NOC or NOCs for \"Apo-Enalapril\". On that same day this application was first heard and adjourned for hearing in relation to an interlocutory injunction on September 24th.\n[21]\nIn the meantime, following the issue of the NOC, Apotex had commenced its plans for selling \"Apo-Enalapril\", including applications to be listed in all provincial drug formularies, except British Columbia where no such listing is required. In the other provinces that listing is required at least in relation to authorized substitution of a generic product for a prescribed drug, and formularies are published about every six months, in January and June. The market for a generic product, like \"Apo-Enalapril\", is dependant upon its lower price than the original prescribed drug and provincial regulations for substitution of listed generic drugs. Apotex anticipates that, as the first generic producer in the market of this important drug product, its sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" will soon grow to $50 million per year, a significant portion of the total market developed by Merck Frosst for \"Vasotec\".\n[22]\nOne further factor of some significance in this case is the nature of the action initiated September 1991. Counsel for both parties were agreed that on the basis of the evidence thus far adduced there appear to be narrow issues to be resolved in the action. They concern essentially the application of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\nupon which Apotex relies in part for its defence, and the validity of the patent's claim for combining enalapril maleate with a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising enalapril maleate in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, primarily claim 10. In view of the limited issues counsel for both parties were agreed that preparations for trial would not require more than a few months and, if the court could accommodate them, the matter might be heard as early as February or March 1994, provided an agreed timetable for preparation could be arranged under the court's supervision. Thus, in terms of a normal patent infringement action, the time for an interlocutory injunction to apply, should one be awarded, or the time for possible damages to the plaintiff if one should not be awarded, is minimal. Both parties affirmed a mutual interest in having trial and resolution of the issues as quickly as possible.\nThe Issues\n[23]\nThis application raises two principal issues and two others of subordinate importance. The first principal issue is whether this court should consider the application at all, in circumstances which the defendant describes as raising an issue of estoppel or abuse of process in that my colleague Mr. Justice Gibson has already determined that the plaintiffs have not established they will suffer irreparable harm on evidence in essence similar to that here presented. If the application is to be considered, the second principal issue is whether the plaintiffs here establish they will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not awarded, or, in the terms urged by the plaintiffs, whether on weighing the balance of convenience an injunction should issue. The other issues, in my view subordinate, relate to matters to be considered in assessing the balance of convenience between the parties, and ultimately the court's exercise of discretion. The first is, what is the status quo that should be preserved by issue or denial of an injunction, and the second is whether the plaintiffs have so delayed in seeking interlocutory relief that the court should decline to consider an injunction at this time. Neither of these issues needs to be finally determined unless the plaintiffs are persuasive for other reasons that an interlocutory injunction should be seriously considered.\nIssue Estoppel Or Abuse Of Process\n[24]\nIn his reasons for order in staying the order of July 16 directed to the Minister to issue an NOC to Apotex, my colleague Mr. Justice Gibson considered the evidence before him of irreparable harm claimed by Merck. He concluded that this was not established, except insofar as the appeal by Merck would be rendered moot or nugatory and on that ground he ordered the stay pending disposition of the appeal (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). He said at pp. 250-251:\n\"I find that there is no doubt on the face of the material before me that Merck has a major economic interest in protecting its exclusive market in Canada for the drug in question and that its exclusive position would be put at risk in the long term if the Minister were to issue an NOC to Apotex. The damages that Merck would suffer are somewhat speculative and would turn at least in part on the strength of its patent protection. Some elements of the damages might be very difficult to calculate but the major elements flowing from market loss would not be. In any event, I am not satisfied the harm would be such that it would be difficult to compensate in damages, to use again the words of Beetz, J.\n. . . . .\n\"I find that on the facts of this case, if no stay is granted and the Minister complies with the mandamus order, as she or he undoubtedly would, Merck's appeal, as it relates to the denial of prohibition, would be rendered nugatory. I find this result to constitute irreparable harm, that meets the test set out by Beetz, J., in\nMetropolitan Stores\n, that is harm not susceptible or difficult to be compensable in damages. On this basis, the second element of the test is met.\"\n[25]\nIn allowing the appeal by Apotex from the stay order granted by Gibson, J., Mr. Justice Mahoney stated (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)):\n\"We are all of the opinion that the learned trial judge erred in deciding that the appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Dubé made July 16, 1993, directing that a notice of compliance be issued in respect of a certain drug, would be rendered moot or nugatory unless stayed. If the appeal is allowed, the order will be set aside and the notice of compliance quashed. Since the trial judge found, correctly in our view, that issuance of the notice of compliance would not result in irreparable harm, it follows that he erred in principle in staying the order of Dubé, J.\"\n[26]\nThe defendant submits that Mr. Justice Gibson, on the stay application, has previously considered the question of irreparable harm fully in proceedings involving the same parties, on virtually the same evidence as is adduced in this application, and he found that irreparable harm had not been demonstrated. That finding was expressly endorsed by the Court of Appeal. Thus, the defendant submits that given that the legal issue of irreparable harm is the same, it would be highly inappropriate for this court to consider the submissions anew and come to a conclusion which would reverse the court's previous finding, especially in view of the endorsement by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff should be estopped from raising the matter again. Raising the issue again is an abuse of the court's process and the application should be dismissed.\n[27]\nIn my opinion, while it is true that the tests are the same for a stay as for an interlocutory injunction, this court has the obligation to consider the evidence adduced which is not entirely the same as that before Mr. Justice Gibson. Affidavits of the principal affiants on behalf of the plaintiffs are said to be substantially the same as affidavits relied upon in the proceedings before Gibson, J., but in my view, while they are similar, they are not the same. The defendant's affiants have been examined on their affidavits, adding to the evidence before me. Moreover, the memorandum of argument in support of the stay application does not deal with all of the evidence or all of the arguments addressed to me. Thus, I am not persuaded that the evidence in this case is identical to that which was before Mr. Justice Gibson. Moreover, the proceedings for a stay involved Merck's rights in relation to an order directed to the Minister before an NOC issued to Apotex, a situation different from that in these proceedings, after issue of an NOC, concerning the rights of private parties inter se in relation to intellectual property rights claimed under a registered patent.\n[28]\nI conclude that the previous finding of Gibson, J., endorsed by the Court of Appeal, that in the application for a stay the plaintiffs did not establish they would suffer irreparable harm if the NOC were issued, is not determinative of the issues and arguments here raised and the plaintiffs are not to be barred in seeking relief by the principle of issue estoppel.\nThe Threshold - A Serious Issue\n[29]\nIt is now well settled that for this court the test or standard for assessing whether an interlocutory injunction should issue is that set out by Stone, J.A., for the Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1, at pp. 18-20 (F.C.A.). Sometimes described as a tripartite test, Stone, J.A., at p. 20 (C.P.R.), in fact listed several factors to be considered and emphasized that these factors \"do not constitute a series of mechanical steps that are to be followed in some sort of drilled progression ... considerable flexibility is called for, bearing in mind that the balance of convenience is of paramount importance\". Treating the factors to be considered in a flexible manner, as a multi-requisite test for assessing the balance of convenience was also endorsed as appropriate, at least in relation to the law of British Columbia, by Madame Justice McLachlin, then of the B.C. Court of Appeal, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 213-215 (B.C.C.A.), appeal dismissed (1991), 120 N.R. 208 (S.C.C.). The ultimate question in each case is whether it is just and equitable in all the circumstances that an interlocutory injunction, an extraordinary remedy, should be granted [see footnote 1].\n[30]\nAcknowledging that the factors to be considered should be flexibly assessed, the threshold requirement for the applicant to establish is that there is a serious issue in the sense that the action is neither frivolous nor vexatious.\n[31]\nI am satisfied that the plaintiffs' action does raise serious issues that, absent settlement between the parties, can only be resolved by a trial. The plaintiffs claim on their investigation of the defendant's \"Apo-Enalapril\" product, that the defendants infringe their rights under Canadian patent 1,275,349 and that the defence relied on in large part by the defendant, s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n, properly construed, does not extend to protect the activities of the defendant in this case. The defendant urges that its activities are within the scope of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n[see footnote 2] and that moreover claims of the patent, in particular claim 10 in relation to the tablet form, is invalid. Essentially the defence is that under s. 56, the bulk product obtained by Apotex prior to the issue of Merck's patent could be used in the only manner that product could be used, i.e., by incorporation in pharmaceutical tablets, and those tablets are not an infringement of the patent since its claim to the use of the drug compound combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is not a valid claim. In light of these defences Apotex urges that in view of the pleadings in this case there is not a serious issue before the court, or at best the plaintiffs' case is a weak one.\n[32]\nAt this stage, pending full opportunity for those issues to be addressed at trial, there can be no doubt that there are serious issues before the court and the threshold test is met by the plaintiffs.\nIrreparable Harm And The\nBalance Of Convenience\n[33]\nIt is urged by plaintiffs that this is not simply a routine case of alleged infringement, rather it concerns infringement of patent rights to the leading prescription drug in dollar terms in Canada, a drug widely recognized for its therapeutic qualities and widely used by thousands of persons who have come to rely on the plaintiffs as the source of supply. It has most significant value in the goodwill of the plaintiffs. Where there is doubt as to the adequacy of the remedy in damages if the plaintiffs are successful at trial, it is urged that in considering an interlocutory injunction the court must consider the balance of convenience to the parties, if an injunction be granted or denied at this stage (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1975] 1 All E.R. 504 (H.L.), per Lord Diplock at p. 408). Doubt as to the adequacy of damages must relate to harm perceived to the plaintiff, or to the defendant, but for this court it is established that harm may not be merely speculative (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 129 (F.C.A.), per Heald, J.A., at p. 135).\n[34]\nHere it is urged that there is doubt as to the adequacy of damages as a remedy for the plaintiffs in the event they are successful at trial and their position is not now protected by an interlocutory injunction. Loss, or harm, is predicated on the anticipated loss to Merck Frosst of a minimum of 50% of its market for \"Vasotec\" once the Apotex \"Apo-Enalapril\" is added to provincial drug formularies, resulting in devastating loss of sales for Merck Frosst. Moreover, the value of its goodwill will be seriously affected by loss of its market advantage as the only supplier of the most valuable, in sales terms, prescription drug in Canada. It is said its reputation as a leading innovator in the pharmaceutical field will also be adversely affected. Both its goodwill and its reputation, it is said, are at risk in view of potential harm that could arise with consumers of the Apotex tablets whose origin, age, shelf life and stability are unknown but which are identical in colour, size, shape and concentration to the plaintiffs' \"Vasotec\" brand. In my view, potential harm of this last sort cannot be more than speculative, given the issue of an NOC to Apotex authorizing sale of its product for consumption in Canada after satisfactory assessment of its safety and efficacy by the Health Protection Branch on behalf of the Minister of Health and Welfare. Moreover, I am not persuaded that Apotex entry into the market for the drug in question will adversely affect the plaintiffs' reputation as a leading innovator in the pharmaceutical field. Important as this drug may be, the plaintiffs and defendant already are in competition in the market for other drugs without apparent adverse effect upon the plaintiffs' reputation. The entry of a generic producer into the market does not in itself adversely affect the reputation of the innovator whose product has become the model for the generic product.\n[35]\nLoss of market share and profits for Merck Frosst will, it is urged, result in harm to the plaintiffs in several respects. Some of these, in my opinion, are speculative. Thus I would class the plaintiffs' concerns that Merck Frosst's competitiveness will be reduced, not only in relation to \"Vasotec\" but also its other products, because of higher production costs, and that loss of substantial market share will result in layoff of employees  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Frosst's plant at Kirkland, Quebec, or in the reduction of current or projected levels of medical research it conducts. The plaintiffs express concern that loss of market share will not be recoverable, if an injunction is not now granted and the plaintiffs succeed at trial, because improved antihypertensive agents are being developed which will challenge the leadership of the \"Vasotec\" product but that, in my opinion, if it occurs, will be the result of new products in the market rather than entry of the defendant into the market with its \"Apo-Enalapril\".\n[36]\nThese concerns are merely speculative for another reason, in my view. At best they relate to long-term implications of Apotex's entry into the market, not to effects to be realized in the interim pending trial, if the parties are indeed determined to bring this action to trial without delay. As noted, counsel agreed that if trial dates can be arranged the action could be tried as early as some five or six months hence. Counsel for Apotex acknowledges that the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product will make little impact in the market in Canada until after publication of provincial formularies now anticipated for January 1994, so that its presence in the national market will be of significance only for a brief period before an early trial.\n[37]\nThe plaintiffs also urge that the value of Merck's patent as an asset will be severely reduced by the entry of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" in the market. I am not persuaded this is a factor to be considered at this stage since if that were to occur it would result from trial of the action upholding the defences advanced by Apotex and denying the claims of the plaintiffs. If the Apotex defences and counterclaim are not accepted at trial the value of the Merck patent as an asset will not be seriously reduced by any brief period of active sales in the market by Apotex between now and trial, assuming the parties are serious in having this action tried as quickly as possible. If Apotex is out of the market as a result of the trial the value of the patent as an asset, for the plaintiffs' ongoing operations or for purposes of licensing others, would be unaffected.\n[38]\nFinally, it is urged that permitting Apotex to sell its product would be contrary to the public policy of Canada established by the\nPatent Act Amendment Act, 1992\nand the\nPatent Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n. It is suggested that under the arrangements prevailing until February 1993, when that\nAct\ncame into force, the earliest date for any generic producer to have received a compulsory license was 1994, and that Apotex has simply taken advantage of a change in arrangements for compulsory licensing. The argument, in my view, assumes validity of the patent and a particular interpretation of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n, and that the defences raised by Apotex will not be accepted at trial. At this stage, on an interlocutory application, the court cannot prejudge those issues.\n[39]\nFor Apotex it is urged that if an interlocutory injunction is granted and is found at trial to be unwarranted, it would suffer irreparable harm not adequately compensated by an award of damages. That harm would be occasioned by delay in its access to the market and potential loss to its position as the first generic producer in the market for enalapril maleate products. If an injunction were now awarded it would have to withdraw its requests for listing in provincial formularies and even with an early trial date if it is then found that an injunction is not warranted it would not manage to be listed in those publications before January 1995 at the earliest, in view of the lead time required for application for listing in advance of publication. Much or all of its product now in tablet form would have to be destroyed in view of its relatively short shelf life. Moreover, loss of its significant position as the first generic producer in the market could not be compensated in damages, an argument which the plaintiffs' claim supports their position as the first, and until September 2, 1993, the only holder of an NOC for sale of enalapril maleate products for sale in the Canadian market.\n[40]\nApotex also claims an injunction would cause irreparable harm in that its substantial investment in growth and development of the company, in new plant and added specialized staff, would be in jeopardy. While that investment may not have been based on anticipated returns from sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" alone, those anticipated returns are even more significant than originally contemplated for the enactment of\nPatent Act\namendments and new regulations postpones opportunity for production of other products contemplated under compulsory licenses for which it expected to successfully apply. The plaintiffs urge that such argument not be considered for Apotex entered into its program to develop \"Apo-Enalapril\" with its eyes open, well knowing that the plaintiffs' product was subject to patent rights. In my view, the claim of Apotex to potential harm in this respect, i.e., the impact on its combined activities of loss of cash flow from sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" if those be enjoined pending trial, can only be classed as speculative at best. It is a substantial company, just as the plaintiffs are. In my view, neither of them is likely to be adversely affected in their overall corporate arrangements, pending trial, whatever the outcome of this application may be.\n[41]\nThere is one further general argument raised by Apotex that in my view has significance. This is that the nature of the market for enalapril finished drugs is dependent upon the plaintiffs' program of educating prescribing physicians about the advantages of \"Vasotec\" for the conditions for which it is used as treatment. That is how the market as a whole is developed and maintained. That market, overall, is not likely to be affected by the entry of Apotex products for the defendant relies upon its promotion to pharmacists, not physicians, and upon provincial drug substitution programs. Since only the plaintiffs' product and that of Apotex will be in the market, any advantage of Apotex will be dependent upon the plaintiffs' willingness to compete in pricing their product. Any success Apotex may achieve in developing a share in the market, it is conceded by the defendant's counsel, will be at the expense of the plaintiffs' market share, and that can easily be accounted for between now and trial of the action.\n[42]\nI am not persuaded that, in the circumstances of this case the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm between now and trial of the action, that is, harm that will not be adequately compensated in damages. While assessing compensation may not be easy in all respects, mere difficulty in precisely calculating damages does not constitute harm that is not adequately compensable in damages, and it is sufficient that there be some reasonably accurate way of measuring them (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 55 (F.C.A.)).\n[43]\nCounsel for both parties cited numerous authorities. I propose to briefly refer only to those relied upon by plaintiffs as instances where harm of the sort here claimed in certain respects has been previously recognized.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 459 (T.D.) my colleague Madame Justice Reed granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting comparative advertising using a competitor's trademark and trade name associated with services where the focus of the advertising was the goodwill of the competitor's business. That is a very different situation than is here presented, that is, the plaintiffs' claim that the entry of Apotex into the market will adversely affect the goodwill generally, as a business asset, of the plaintiffs. In my view, any effect of the nature here claimed would merely be the result of competition, and adverse effect upon the goodwill of the plaintiffs cannot be said to be the focus or main purpose of Apotex in producing and selling \"Apo-Enalapril\". Indeed the plaintiffs claim, and Apotex concedes, its primary purpose in so doing is simply to make money.\n[44]\nDamage to a plaintiff's reputation has been accepted as a basis warranting an interim injunction pending hearing of the matter in an action alleging infringement of patent rights and passing off (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.)), and it has also been accepted as a basis for an interlocutory injunction in an action concerning trademarks where the plaintiff claimed confusion and an attempt by the defendant to profit from the goodwill and reputation established by the plaintiff's use of its trade name over some years (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 409 (T.D.)). In my opinion, the considerations relating to an interim injunction pending hearing of the matter are different from those to be assessed at the later hearing of the application for an interlocutory order. The considerations here raised are also different from those where a trade name is used for retail stores which name is alleged to be confusing with an established trademark name. In such a case the principle decision-makers determining the market are members of the public as consumers, whereas in this case the principle decision-makers determining the market are prescribing physicians, for the plaintiffs' product, and pharmacists and provincial regulations for the defendant's product. In my view, neither of the cases cited supports the plaintiffs' claim that harm to its general reputation arising solely from competition by Apotex should be recognized as harm for which damages at law might not be an adequate remedy.\n[45]\nLoss of market share or profit margin has been a factor in a finding that harm is not adequately compensated by damages, warranting an interlocutory injunction, in certain circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  injunction in circumstances he characterized as unique where the defendant had a long-standing contract to use the plaintiff's patented product and then proposed to bring to market its own product which was alleged to infringe the plaintiff's patent. There is no such contractual relationship between Apotex and Merck in this case. In\nCabot Corp. et al. v. 3M Canada Inc.\n(1987), 10 F.T.R. 210; 15 C.P.R.(3d) 247 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Joyal similarly granted an injunction pending trial of an action by a patent holder claiming infringement of its patented earplug product by the defendant who planned to introduce a competing product into the market, in circumstances where he found the factors affecting the parties' interests were evenly balanced and preserving the status quo by granting an injunction seemed warranted, following Lord Diplock in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1975] 1 All E.R. 504. In that case the status quo was considered to be the market situation at the time relief was sought, before the defendant entered the market. In my view, the circumstances before me differ. In\nCabot\nthe defendant's sales projections were minimal in relation to the total market and in relation to the defendant's total projected sales of all its products, and the defendant had not invested except in the inventory of the product provided by its U.S. parent. Here projected sales of Apotex are substantial; they are expected to attract a large share of the market, and they result from substantial capital investment by the defendant in a product which may, because of its relatively short shelf life, deteriorate and be of no value for sale if the defendant is enjoined from selling pending trial and then must await later listing in provincial drug formularies for some months after trial. In short, the stakes appear higher for the defendant Apotex, if an injunction should now issue, than they were for the defendant in\nCabot\n, and the plaintiffs' case here is not as strong as that of the plaintiff in that case, for there the plaintiff's patent had been upheld as valid in proceedings in Germany and it was ready to go to trial in this country in an unrelated action where validity of its Canadian patent would be determined.\n[46]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 493, Madame Justice Reed granted an interlocutory injunction in a case where she found clear evidence of infringement of patents for products in a market in a great state of flux. New industry standards indicated possible changes of significance in market share among competitors and business relationships established after adoption of new industry standards would have a long-term effect that could not easily be quantified. In such a case she found that monetary damages would not be adequate to remedy the harm arising from lost sales which resulted in a substantial loss of market share. Those circumstances, warranting an interlocutory injunction pending trial, are not present in the case at bar, in my view. The relative strengths of each party's case is here not so clearly determined at this stage, the market for the products here in issue is not subject to the same uncertainty as anticipated new industry standards presented in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and the market in this case will be served not from numerous sources but only by the plaintiffs if an injunction is granted, and if not, then by the two parties here involved. In the latter case, if no injunction issues, the plaintiffs' loss of market share and of sales will be readily calculable by sales made by the defendant who can be required to keep appropriate accounts pending trial.\n[47]\nIn my view, none of the cases referred to are definitive in determining that harm claimed by the plaintiffs may not be adequately compensated by damages following trial. Moreover, there are cases which support the conclusion that harm from loss of sales or profit margin and market share that may arise from sales of a generic brand of a pharmaceutical prescription product, which is substituted for the original brand because of lower prices, are readily quantifiable and adequately compensated by an award of damages [see footnote 3].\n[48]\nOne circumstance in this case, already referred to, relates to the harm anticipated by the plaintiffs if no injunction now issues. It is not unreasonable to expect trial of the action to be within six months. In that period Apotex's sales under provincial regulatory systems for drug substitution will have been made from September 1993 in British Columbia, but substantially only from January 1994 in all other provinces. In that time, in my view any loss in goodwill or reputation, if it be proven, can be compensated by damages, and loss of sales and market share can be calculated by reference to sales by Apotex, and loss of profits to the plaintiffs can be accounted for by adjusting those sales for the price differential between the products of the parties. If the plaintiffs succeed at trial in my opinion the harm suffered in the period pending trial will be adequately compensated by an appropriate award of damages.\nConclusion\n[49]\nI conclude, reflecting the words of Stone, J.A., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1, at p. 19, that the plaintiffs' recoverable damages resulting from continuance of the defendant's activities pending trial would be an adequate remedy. No question is raised about the defendant's ability to pay damages that may be awarded if the plaintiffs succeed at trial.\n[50]\nIn light of that conclusion other factors argued need not be determined. In particular, the defendant's concern that the plaintiffs have delayed unduly in seeking injunctive relief is only relevant if I were persuaded that an injunction should be seriously considered. If it were necessary to rule on that issue, it is my view that the plaintiffs have adequately explained why application was not earlier made in this action begun nearly two years ago, essentially because until the defendant had an NOC they had no authorization to see \"Apo-Enalapril\" in Canada and the case for claiming irreparable harm would have been even more difficult to make.\n[51]\nWere it necessary to resolve the differences between the parties as to the situation to be preserved if preservation of the status quo were a determining factor in this application, in my view the situation to be recognized is that urged by the defendant. That is that the defendants had commenced the process of seeking an NOC before the patent in issue was granted to the plaintiffs, its entitlement to an NOC has been determined by this court, and that notice has now been issued, subject only to reversal and cancellation of the NOC if the plaintiffs are successful in the appeal recently heard by the Court of Appeal. (See generally,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 129, at pp. 138-139.) In these circumstances preservation of the status quo would support the conclusion that an interlocutory injunction pending trial should not issue.\n[52]\nWhile I decline to grant relief by an injunction pending trial, the alternative relief claimed in the plaintiffs' application, while it was not argued at the hearing, is entirely appropriate. The defendant cannot seriously object to an order requiring the maintenance of appropriate records and accounts pending trial, just as it has been required to do since this application was first heard for interim relief on September 2, 1993 and then adjourned on terms.\n[53]\nAn order will go dismissing the plaintiffs' application for an interlocutory injunction pending trial, but allowing their application for an order that the defendant maintain records and accounts. Counsel for the parties are asked to consult on the terms of an order directing the maintenance of accounts and, if they can agree on terms by November 1, 1993, to submit those in form of a draft order consistent with these reasons, pursuant to rule 324(1). If the terms are not agreed upon the court will of its own motion resolve those terms, taking into account any representations either party may wish to submit in writing.\n[54]\nFinally, with a view to exploring how trial of the action may be expedited and to consider the development of a schedule for pretrial preparations, if that be desirable, counsel are invited to arrange with the office of the Associate Chief Justice for a pretrial conference, by telephone conference call or by appearance.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Reginald W.

The injunction sought would restrain the defendant, its officers, servants, agents and associated, subsidiary or affiliated corporations from:\n\"(a) further infringing Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349; and\n\"(b) manufacturing, importing, exporting, selling or offering for sale in Canada or from Canada, any enalapril, enalapril maleate in bulk or tablet form in violation of the rights granted under Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349;\"\nor in the alternative, the plaintiff seeks an order\n\"that the defendant keep an account of all enalapril (and enalapril maleate) from time to time in its possession, custody or power ... and furnish to the plaintiff ... monthly statements of its manufactures, purchases and sales and inventory of enalapril and enalapril maleate whether in bulk or tablet form.\"\n\n[2]\nLeave was granted for the matter to be heard on short notice and on September 2, after hearing counsel for the parties, on consent, the application was adjourned to September 24, when it was heard in relation to the application for an interlocutory injunction. At the adjournment terms agreed upon required the defendant to maintain records of sales of enalapril maleate in bulk or dosage form until further order of the court.\nThe Background\n\n[3]\nThe plaintiff, Merck & Co. Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), is a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in the United States. It is said to be the largest innovative pharmaceutical company in the world. It is the owner of Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349, issued on October 16, 1990, which contains claims to the compounds enalapril and enalapril maleate (collectively, \"enalapril\") among others, to pharmaceutical compositions of enalapril, and to use of certain of the compounds and the pharmaceutical compositions as an anti-hypertensive. Merck Frosst Canada Inc. (\"Merck Frosst\"), a Canadian company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck. It is said to be the leading pharmaceutical company in Canada in terms of sales, and it has the largest private pharmaceutical research program in Canada, spending some $47 million on research in 1992, a figure in excess of 10 per cent to its annual revenues. Merck Frosst is the exclusive licensee under the patent, at least for Canada.\n\n[4]\nEnalapril and enalapril maleate are generic names for compounds developed from research done in an extensive program for synthetic chemical development undertaken by Merck U.S. Through its division known as Merck Sharp & Dohme, Merck Frosst markets enalapril maleate in tablet form in Canada under the trademark \"Vasotec\" in four different strengths and in an injectable form. Since 1987, and until September 2, 1993, Merck Frosst has been the only company in Canada which held a Notice of Compliance (\"NOC\") from the Minister of National Health and Welfare for the manufacture and sale of enalapril in Canada. Its sales of the product \"Vasotec\" are most important to Merck Frosst, now accounting for about one-third of its annual sales revenues. As we will note, as a result of judicial proceedings, on September 2 the Minister issued a notice or notices of compliance to Apotex relating to its three strengths of \"Apo-Enalapril\", its generic products comparable to Merck Frosst's \"Vasotec\" product. An NOC is required for marketing of a prescription drug for human consumption in Canada.\n\n[5]\n\"Vasotec\" is now the most often prescribed drug for treating hypertension in Canada and it also has a dominant position in the treatment of congestive heart failure. More than 370,000 Canadian patients now use \"Vasotec\" prescriptions. \"Vasotec\" competes with several other drugs for the treatment of hypertension but it is now said to be the prescription drug with the highest value of sales in Canada. Its annual market has grown at a rapid rate, with sales in excess of $120 million in 1992 and sales forecast at $150 million in 1993.\n\n[6]\nThe defendant, Apotex Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) is a Canadian company incorporated in Ontario, carrying on business as a manufacturer and distributor of generic pharmaceutical products. It is the largest producer of generic prescription drugs in Canada, manufacturing and selling drugs invented by others. Apotex has never applied for and has never held a license, compulsory or otherwise, from Merck to import, manufacture or sell enalapril for use or consumption in Canada or elsewhere.\n\n[7]\nApotex claims that it commenced development of its version of enalapril maleate in 1987 and that substantial quantities of enalapril maleate in bulk as raw material were acquired in 1989 and 1990, prior to the issuance of the Merck Canadian patent on October 16, 1990. Apotex claims to have invested tens of millions of dollars for new facilities in its corporate growth and development programs based, at least in large part, upon anticipated returns to be realized from sales of its product \"Apo-Enalapril\", and other products.\n\n[8]\nIn February 1990, Apotex applied to the Health Protection Branch of the Department of National Health and Welfare for an NOC to market its version of enalapril maleate under the trademark \"Apo-Enalapril\" and it had anticipated obtaining an NOC by the end of 1992. By the latter half of 1992, Apotex had manufactured several million \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets, bearing an expiry date of two years from the date of manufacture. The compound, enalapril maleate, in bulk form is said to be very stable for an indefinite period provided it is maintained under particular conditions. In tablet form it has a much reduced shelf life.\n\n[9]\nIn March 1991, Merck became aware that enalapril tablets, not of Merck origin, were appearing in the Caribbean Islands. Those tablets were traced to the defendant and in May 1991, Merck obtained three sample bottles of \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets in the 5 mg., 10 mg., and 20 mg. dosage forms, produced by Apotex in Toronto. Apotex's \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets are generally similar in size, shape, colour and concentration of the drug to corresponding \"Vasotec\" tablets of Merck Canada. Chemical analysis of the Apotex products by Merck staff in August and September 1991 resulted in a report that identified the presence in those products of enalapril maleate of the chemical composition set out in at least claim 4 of the Merck patent, which claims the enalapril maleate product. The tablets containing that compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are considered by Merck to infringe at least claim 10 of the Canadian patent. That claim relates to \"a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising an effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of [enalapril] in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\". The report of Merck's staff also indicated that the 5 mg. tablet of Apotex demonstrated degradation due to instability.\nLegal Proceedings To Date\n\n[10]\nOn September 20, 1991, the plaintiffs commenced this action against Apotex for alleged infringement of the Merck patent, alleging the importation, manufacture, use and sale in Canada and to Caribbean countries of enalapril and enalapril maleate, and the application by Apotex for an NOC in respect of its product \"Apo-Enalapril\" with which it was said to be conducting clinical trials in Canada. Apotex filed a defence and counterclaim in this action in November 1991, denying infringement of the Merck patent, and denying that application had been made for an NOC. Apotex claims that the enalapril maleate used in its tablets was manufactured in Canada prior to the issuance of Merck's patent and thus, in using that product, Apotex was not infringing, by virtue of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n. The counterclaim by Apotex seeks a declaration that certain claims of the Merck patent, claims 8 to 17, are invalid. On February 6, 1992 the plaintiffs filed a reply to the defence and a defence to the counterclaim. On January 21, 1993 Merck applied for an order for inspection and for delivery by Apotex of samples of \"Apo-Enalapril\" for testing by Merck, a motion adjourned and still pending. There was no further activity in relation to the action until this application, presented on short notice on September 2, 1993. In the meantime, however, there have been a number of developments of significance in the relations between the parties.\n\n[11]\nIn May 1992, the plaintiffs commenced a second action against certain companies associated with Apotex, and Mr. Bernard Sherman, the President and Chief Directing Officer of the defendant, claiming infringement of the Merck patent in relation to \"Vasotec\" by manufacture and sale by mail order of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product of Apotex. Apotex itself was subsequently joined as a defendant in that action.\n\n[12]\nThroughout 1992 and early 1993 Merck and other pharmaceutical companies involved Apotex and others in proceedings in the United States that apparently resulted in regulatory orders prohibiting the sale in the United States, through mail order arrangements, by companies located outside the U.S., of drug products not specifically authorized for sale in that country. Those proceedings are not relevant to the issues here considered.\n\n[13]\nOn December 22, 1992, Apotex brought an application in this court for judicial review, seeking an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the Minister of National Health and Welfare to issue NOCs, for which it had applied, for a number of its products, including \"Apo-Enalapril\".\n\n[14]\nOn January 5, 1993, this court dismissed an application by Apotex and others to enjoin Parliament from enacting Bill C-91 which included proposed amendments to the\nPatent Act\nin relation to prescription drug products [see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Those amendments, subsequently enacted as S.C. 1993, c. 2, changed the arrangements under the former regime for compulsory licensing, and they extend patent protection to 20 years, in a manner that may significantly assist pharmaceutical companies engaged in research, development, and marketing of original drug products. On the same day the injunction application was dismissed, a television news report on the matter included film footage of what appeared to be the interior of an Apotex warehouse in which the product \"Apo-Enalapril\" is shown along with a sign stating \"10 mg, 100, exp. 5/95, V8440\" and \"For Export\". Thereafter, as earlier noted, the plaintiffs brought a motion for an order for inspection of Apotex premises in respect of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product shown on the national news report, a motion adjourned and still pending before this court.\n\n[15]\nOn February 4, 1993, the\nPatent Act Amendment Act, 1992\nformerly Bill C-91, was given Royal Assent. Most of its statutory provisions were proclaimed in force on February 15, 1993, but s. 55.2 of the\nAct\n, which provides for regulation-making authority, and regulations thereunder, were proclaimed only as of March 12, 1993. The\nPatented Medicine (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\nthen enacted have significantly changed procedures for obtaining an NOC, essentially prohibiting the Minister from granting one in any case where there are existing product and use patents, which are to be valid for 20 years, pertaining to the same drug as is the subject matter of the application for an NOC.\n\n[16]\nOn February 22, 1993, Merck filed an application for an order of prohibition to prohibit the Minister issuing an NOC to Apotex. On March 4, Apotex applied by motion for an order directing that an NOC or NOCs be issued for \"Apo-Enalapril\". On March 18, both the Merck and Apotex applications were ordered to be consolidated for hearing.\n\n[17]\nThe applications by Apotex to compel, and by Merck to prohibit, the Minister of Health and Welfare to issue an NOC in relation to \"Apo-Enalapril\" were heard by my colleague Mr. Justice Dubé on June 21 and 22, 1993. On July 16, for reasons then filed, he ordered that the Minister issue the NOC sought by Apotex and he dismissed the application by Merck for prohibition [see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n\n[18]\nThe following day, July 17, on short notice, Merck applied to Mr. Justice Gibson of this court for an order to stay the order of Mr. Justice Dubé pending an appeal by Merck from the latter's decision. An interim stay was granted, pending hearing of the application on July 23 and until the matter was disposed of. On July 27 Mr. Justice Gibson granted an order staying the order of Dubé, J., pending determination of the appeal which by then was initiated by Merck against the decision of Dubé, J. From that order of Mr. Justice Gibson, Apotex appealed. On August 31 and September 1 the Court of Appeal heard both the Merck appeal and the appeal by Apotex. It reserved decision in relation to the appeal by Merck but on September 1, Mahoney, J.A., for the court, allowed the Apotex appeal. He found that the motions judge had erred in basing his order on the ground that Merck's appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Dubé would be rendered moot or nugatory. That decision, setting aside the stay order of Mr. Justice Gibson, set the stage for this application, originally brought on short notice on the following day, September 2.\n\n[19]\nOn September 1, a further news report on national television showed film footage of what appeared to be the interior of an Apotex warehouse, including apparently large quantities of packaged \"Apo-Enalapril\" tablets ready for shipment. The news report included an interview with Mr. Sherman who stated that \"Apo-Enalapril\" would be available at 20 per cent below the price of the Merck product.\n\n[20]\nFollowing the decision of the Court of Appeal, on September 2, 1993, the Minister issued to Apotex an NOC or NOCs for \"Apo-Enalapril\". On that same day this application was first heard and adjourned for hearing in relation to an interlocutory injunction on September 24th.\n\n[21]\nIn the meantime, following the issue of the NOC, Apotex had commenced its plans for selling \"Apo-Enalapril\", including applications to be listed in all provincial drug formularies, except British Columbia where no such listing is required. In the other provinces that listing is required at least in relation to authorized substitution of a generic product for a prescribed drug, and formularies are published about every six months, in January and June. The market for a generic product, like \"Apo-Enalapril\", is dependant upon its lower price than the original prescribed drug and provincial regulations for substitution of listed generic drugs. Apotex anticipates that, as the first generic producer in the market of this important drug product, its sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" will soon grow to $50 million per year, a significant portion of the total market developed by Merck Frosst for \"Vasotec\".\n\n[22]\nOne further factor of some significance in this case is the nature of the action initiated September 1991. Counsel for both parties were agreed that on the basis of the evidence thus far adduced there appear to be narrow issues to be resolved in the action. They concern essentially the application of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\nupon which Apotex relies in part for its defence, and the validity of the patent's claim for combining enalapril maleate with a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising enalapril maleate in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, primarily claim 10. In view of the limited issues counsel for both parties were agreed that preparations for trial would not require more than a few months and, if the court could accommodate them, the matter might be heard as early as February or March 1994, provided an agreed timetable for preparation could be arranged under the court's supervision. Thus, in terms of a normal patent infringement action, the time for an interlocutory injunction to apply, should one be awarded, or the time for possible damages to the plaintiff if one should not be awarded, is minimal. Both parties affirmed a mutual interest in having trial and resolution of the issues as quickly as possible.\nThe Issues\n\n[23]\nThis application raises two principal issues and two others of subordinate importance. The first principal issue is whether this court should consider the application at all, in circumstances which the defendant describes as raising an issue of estoppel or abuse of process in that my colleague Mr. Justice Gibson has already determined that the plaintiffs have not established they will suffer irreparable harm on evidence in essence similar to that here presented. If the application is to be considered, the second principal issue is whether the plaintiffs here establish they will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not awarded, or, in the terms urged by the plaintiffs, whether on weighing the balance of convenience an injunction should issue. The other issues, in my view subordinate, relate to matters to be considered in assessing the balance of convenience between the parties, and ultimately the court's exercise of discretion. The first is, what is the status quo that should be preserved by issue or denial of an injunction, and the second is whether the plaintiffs have so delayed in seeking interlocutory relief that the court should decline to consider an injunction at this time. Neither of these issues needs to be finally determined unless the plaintiffs are persuasive for other reasons that an interlocutory injunction should be seriously considered.\nIssue Estoppel Or Abuse Of Process\n\n[24]\nIn his reasons for order in staying the order of July 16 directed to the Minister to issue an NOC to Apotex, my colleague Mr. Justice Gibson considered the evidence before him of irreparable harm claimed by Merck. He concluded that this was not established, except insofar as the appeal by Merck would be rendered moot or nugatory and on that ground he ordered the stay pending disposition of the appeal (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). He said at pp. 250-251:\n\"I find that there is no doubt on the face of the material before me that Merck has a major economic interest in protecting its exclusive market in Canada for the drug in question and that its exclusive position would be put at risk in the long term if the Minister were to issue an NOC to Apotex. The damages that Merck would suffer are somewhat speculative and would turn at least in part on the strength of its patent protection. Some elements of the damages might be very difficult to calculate but the major elements flowing from market loss would not be. In any event, I am not satisfied the harm would be such that it would be difficult to compensate in damages, to use again the words of Beetz, J.\n. . . . .\n\"I find that on the facts of this case, if no stay is granted and the Minister complies with the mandamus order, as she or he undoubtedly would, Merck's appeal, as it relates to the denial of prohibition, would be rendered nugatory. I find this result to constitute irreparable harm, that meets the test set out by Beetz, J., in\nMetropolitan Stores\n, that is harm not susceptible or difficult to be compensable in damages. On this basis, the second element of the test is met.\"\n\n[25]\nIn allowing the appeal by Apotex from the stay order granted by Gibson, J., Mr. Justice Mahoney stated (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)):\n\"We are all of the opinion that the learned trial judge erred in deciding that the appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Dubé made July 16, 1993, directing that a notice of compliance be issued in respect of a certain drug, would be rendered moot or nugatory unless stayed. If the appeal is allowed, the order will be set aside and the notice of compliance quashed. Since the trial judge found, correctly in our view, that issuance of the notice of compliance would not result in irreparable harm, it follows that he erred in principle in staying the order of Dubé, J.\"\n\n[26]\nThe defendant submits that Mr. Justice Gibson, on the stay application, has previously considered the question of irreparable harm fully in proceedings involving the same parties, on virtually the same evidence as is adduced in this application, and he found that irreparable harm had not been demonstrated. That finding was expressly endorsed by the Court of Appeal. Thus, the defendant submits that given that the legal issue of irreparable harm is the same, it would be highly inappropriate for this court to consider the submissions anew and come to a conclusion which would reverse the court's previous finding, especially in view of the endorsement by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff should be estopped from raising the matter again. Raising the issue again is an abuse of the court's process and the application should be dismissed.\n\n[27]\nIn my opinion, while it is true that the tests are the same for a stay as for an interlocutory injunction, this court has the obligation to consider the evidence adduced which is not entirely the same as that before Mr. Justice Gibson. Affidavits of the principal affiants on behalf of the plaintiffs are said to be substantially the same as affidavits relied upon in the proceedings before Gibson, J., but in my view, while they are similar, they are not the same. The defendant's affiants have been examined on their affidavits, adding to the evidence before me. Moreover, the memorandum of argument in support of the stay application does not deal with all of the evidence or all of the arguments addressed to me. Thus, I am not persuaded that the evidence in this case is identical to that which was before Mr. Justice Gibson. Moreover, the proceedings for a stay involved Merck's rights in relation to an order directed to the Minister before an NOC issued to Apotex, a situation different from that in these proceedings, after issue of an NOC, concerning the rights of private parties inter se in relation to intellectual property rights claimed under a registered patent.\n\n[28]\nI conclude that the previous finding of Gibson, J., endorsed by the Court of Appeal, that in the application for a stay the plaintiffs did not establish they would suffer irreparable harm if the NOC were issued, is not determinative of the issues and arguments here raised and the plaintiffs are not to be barred in seeking relief by the principle of issue estoppel.\nThe Threshold - A Serious Issue\n\n[29]\nIt is now well settled that for this court the test or standard for assessing whether an interlocutory injunction should issue is that set out by Stone, J.A., for the Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1, at pp. 18-20 (F.C.A.). Sometimes described as a tripartite test, Stone, J.A., at p. 20 (C.P.R.), in fact listed several factors to be considered and emphasized that these factors \"do not constitute a series of mechanical steps that are to be followed in some sort of drilled progression ... considerable flexibility is called for, bearing in mind that the balance of convenience is of paramount importance\". Treating the factors to be considered in a flexible manner, as a multi-requisite test for assessing the balance of convenience was also endorsed as appropriate, at least in relation to the law of British Columbia, by Madame Justice McLachlin, then of the B.C. Court of Appeal, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 213-215 (B.C.C.A.), appeal dismissed (1991), 120 N.R. 208 (S.C.C.). The ultimate question in each case is whether it is just and equitable in all the circumstances that an interlocutory injunction, an extraordinary remedy, should be granted [see footnote 1].\n\n[30]\nAcknowledging that the factors to be considered should be flexibly assessed, the threshold requirement for the applicant to establish is that there is a serious issue in the sense that the action is neither frivolous nor vexatious.\n\n[31]\nI am satisfied that the plaintiffs' action does raise serious issues that, absent settlement between the parties, can only be resolved by a trial. The plaintiffs claim on their investigation of the defendant's \"Apo-Enalapril\" product, that the defendants infringe their rights under Canadian patent 1,275,349 and that the defence relied on in large part by the defendant, s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n, properly construed, does not extend to protect the activities of the defendant in this case. The defendant urges that its activities are within the scope of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n[see footnote 2] and that moreover claims of the patent, in particular claim 10 in relation to the tablet form, is invalid. Essentially the defence is that under s. 56, the bulk product obtained by Apotex prior to the issue of Merck's patent could be used in the only manner that product could be used, i.e., by incorporation in pharmaceutical tablets, and those tablets are not an infringement of the patent since its claim to the use of the drug compound combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is not a valid claim. In light of these defences Apotex urges that in view of the pleadings in this case there is not a serious issue before the court, or at best the plaintiffs' case is a weak one.\n\n[32]\nAt this stage, pending full opportunity for those issues to be addressed at trial, there can be no doubt that there are serious issues before the court and the threshold test is met by the plaintiffs.\nIrreparable Harm And The\nBalance Of Convenience\n\n[33]\nIt is urged by plaintiffs that this is not simply a routine case of alleged infringement, rather it concerns infringement of patent rights to the leading prescription drug in dollar terms in Canada, a drug widely recognized for its therapeutic qualities and widely used by thousands of persons who have come to rely on the plaintiffs as the source of supply. It has most significant value in the goodwill of the plaintiffs. Where there is doubt as to the adequacy of the remedy in damages if the plaintiffs are successful at trial, it is urged that in considering an interlocutory injunction the court must consider the balance of convenience to the parties, if an injunction be granted or denied at this stage (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1975] 1 All E.R. 504 (H.L.), per Lord Diplock at p. 408). Doubt as to the adequacy of damages must relate to harm perceived to the plaintiff, or to the defendant, but for this court it is established that harm may not be merely speculative (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 129 (F.C.A.), per Heald, J.A., at p. 135).\n\n[34]\nHere it is urged that there is doubt as to the adequacy of damages as a remedy for the plaintiffs in the event they are successful at trial and their position is not now protected by an interlocutory injunction. Loss, or harm, is predicated on the anticipated loss to Merck Frosst of a minimum of 50% of its market for \"Vasotec\" once the Apotex \"Apo-Enalapril\" is added to provincial drug formularies, resulting in devastating loss of sales for Merck Frosst. Moreover, the value of its goodwill will be seriously affected by loss of its market advantage as the only supplier of the most valuable, in sales terms, prescription drug in Canada. It is said its reputation as a leading innovator in the pharmaceutical field will also be adversely affected. Both its goodwill and its reputation, it is said, are at risk in view of potential harm that could arise with consumers of the Apotex tablets whose origin, age, shelf life and stability are unknown but which are identical in colour, size, shape and concentration to the plaintiffs' \"Vasotec\" brand. In my view, potential harm of this last sort cannot be more than speculative, given the issue of an NOC to Apotex authorizing sale of its product for consumption in Canada after satisfactory assessment of its safety and efficacy by the Health Protection Branch on behalf of the Minister of Health and Welfare. Moreover, I am not persuaded that Apotex entry into the market for the drug in question will adversely affect the plaintiffs' reputation as a leading innovator in the pharmaceutical field. Important as this drug may be, the plaintiffs and defendant already are in competition in the market for other drugs without apparent adverse effect upon the plaintiffs' reputation. The entry of a generic producer into the market does not in itself adversely affect the reputation of the innovator whose product has become the model for the generic product.\n\n[35]\nLoss of market share and profits for Merck Frosst will, it is urged, result in harm to the plaintiffs in several respects. Some of these, in my opinion, are speculative. Thus I would class the plaintiffs' concerns that Merck Frosst's competitiveness will be reduced, not only in relation to \"Vasotec\" but also its other products, because of higher production costs, and that loss of substantial market share will result in layoff of employees  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Frosst's plant at Kirkland, Quebec, or in the reduction of current or projected levels of medical research it conducts. The plaintiffs express concern that loss of market share will not be recoverable, if an injunction is not now granted and the plaintiffs succeed at trial, because improved antihypertensive agents are being developed which will challenge the leadership of the \"Vasotec\" product but that, in my opinion, if it occurs, will be the result of new products in the market rather than entry of the defendant into the market with its \"Apo-Enalapril\".\n\n[36]\nThese concerns are merely speculative for another reason, in my view. At best they relate to long-term implications of Apotex's entry into the market, not to effects to be realized in the interim pending trial, if the parties are indeed determined to bring this action to trial without delay. As noted, counsel agreed that if trial dates can be arranged the action could be tried as early as some five or six months hence. Counsel for Apotex acknowledges that the \"Apo-Enalapril\" product will make little impact in the market in Canada until after publication of provincial formularies now anticipated for January 1994, so that its presence in the national market will be of significance only for a brief period before an early trial.\n\n[37]\nThe plaintiffs also urge that the value of Merck's patent as an asset will be severely reduced by the entry of the \"Apo-Enalapril\" in the market. I am not persuaded this is a factor to be considered at this stage since if that were to occur it would result from trial of the action upholding the defences advanced by Apotex and denying the claims of the plaintiffs. If the Apotex defences and counterclaim are not accepted at trial the value of the Merck patent as an asset will not be seriously reduced by any brief period of active sales in the market by Apotex between now and trial, assuming the parties are serious in having this action tried as quickly as possible. If Apotex is out of the market as a result of the trial the value of the patent as an asset, for the plaintiffs' ongoing operations or for purposes of licensing others, would be unaffected.\n\n[38]\nFinally, it is urged that permitting Apotex to sell its product would be contrary to the public policy of Canada established by the\nPatent Act Amendment Act, 1992\nand the\nPatent Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n. It is suggested that under the arrangements prevailing until February 1993, when that\nAct\ncame into force, the earliest date for any generic producer to have received a compulsory license was 1994, and that Apotex has simply taken advantage of a change in arrangements for compulsory licensing. The argument, in my view, assumes validity of the patent and a particular interpretation of s. 56 of the\nPatent Act\n, and that the defences raised by Apotex will not be accepted at trial. At this stage, on an interlocutory application, the court cannot prejudge those issues.\n\n[39]\nFor Apotex it is urged that if an interlocutory injunction is granted and is found at trial to be unwarranted, it would suffer irreparable harm not adequately compensated by an award of damages. That harm would be occasioned by delay in its access to the market and potential loss to its position as the first generic producer in the market for enalapril maleate products. If an injunction were now awarded it would have to withdraw its requests for listing in provincial formularies and even with an early trial date if it is then found that an injunction is not warranted it would not manage to be listed in those publications before January 1995 at the earliest, in view of the lead time required for application for listing in advance of publication. Much or all of its product now in tablet form would have to be destroyed in view of its relatively short shelf life. Moreover, loss of its significant position as the first generic producer in the market could not be compensated in damages, an argument which the plaintiffs' claim supports their position as the first, and until September 2, 1993, the only holder of an NOC for sale of enalapril maleate products for sale in the Canadian market.\n\n[40]\nApotex also claims an injunction would cause irreparable harm in that its substantial investment in growth and development of the company, in new plant and added specialized staff, would be in jeopardy. While that investment may not have been based on anticipated returns from sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" alone, those anticipated returns are even more significant than originally contemplated for the enactment of\nPatent Act\namendments and new regulations postpones opportunity for production of other products contemplated under compulsory licenses for which it expected to successfully apply. The plaintiffs urge that such argument not be considered for Apotex entered into its program to develop \"Apo-Enalapril\" with its eyes open, well knowing that the plaintiffs' product was subject to patent rights. In my view, the claim of Apotex to potential harm in this respect, i.e., the impact on its combined activities of loss of cash flow from sales of \"Apo-Enalapril\" if those be enjoined pending trial, can only be classed as speculative at best. It is a substantial company, just as the plaintiffs are. In my view, neither of them is likely to be adversely affected in their overall corporate arrangements, pending trial, whatever the outcome of this application may be.\n\n[41]\nThere is one further general argument raised by Apotex that in my view has significance. This is that the nature of the market for enalapril finished drugs is dependent upon the plaintiffs' program of educating prescribing physicians about the advantages of \"Vasotec\" for the conditions for which it is used as treatment. That is how the market as a whole is developed and maintained. That market, overall, is not likely to be affected by the entry of Apotex products for the defendant relies upon its promotion to pharmacists, not physicians, and upon provincial drug substitution programs. Since only the plaintiffs' product and that of Apotex will be in the market, any advantage of Apotex will be dependent upon the plaintiffs' willingness to compete in pricing their product. Any success Apotex may achieve in developing a share in the market, it is conceded by the defendant's counsel, will be at the expense of the plaintiffs' market share, and that can easily be accounted for between now and trial of the action.\n\n[42]\nI am not persuaded that, in the circumstances of this case the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm between now and trial of the action, that is, harm that will not be adequately compensated in damages. While assessing compensation may not be easy in all respects, mere difficulty in precisely calculating damages does not constitute harm that is not adequately compensable in damages, and it is sufficient that there be some reasonably accurate way of measuring them (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 55 (F.C.A.)).\n\n[43]\nCounsel for both parties cited numerous authorities. I propose to briefly refer only to those relied upon by plaintiffs as instances where harm of the sort here claimed in certain respects has been previously recognized.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 459 (T.D.) my colleague Madame Justice Reed granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting comparative advertising using a competitor's trademark and trade name associated with services where the focus of the advertising was the goodwill of the competitor's business. That is a very different situation than is here presented, that is, the plaintiffs' claim that the entry of Apotex into the market will adversely affect the goodwill generally, as a business asset, of the plaintiffs. In my view, any effect of the nature here claimed would merely be the result of competition, and adverse effect upon the goodwill of the plaintiffs cannot be said to be the focus or main purpose of Apotex in producing and selling \"Apo-Enalapril\". Indeed the plaintiffs claim, and Apotex concedes, its primary purpose in so doing is simply to make money.\n\n[44]\nDamage to a plaintiff's reputation has been accepted as a basis warranting an interim injunction pending hearing of the matter in an action alleging infringement of patent rights and passing off (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.)), and it has also been accepted as a basis for an interlocutory injunction in an action concerning trademarks where the plaintiff claimed confusion and an attempt by the defendant to profit from the goodwill and reputation established by the plaintiff's use of its trade name over some years (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 409 (T.D.)). In my opinion, the considerations relating to an interim injunction pending hearing of the matter are different from those to be assessed at the later hearing of the application for an interlocutory order. The considerations here raised are also different from those where a trade name is used for retail stores which name is alleged to be confusing with an established trademark name. In such a case the principle decision-makers determining the market are members of the public as consumers, whereas in this case the principle decision-makers determining the market are prescribing physicians, for the plaintiffs' product, and pharmacists and provincial regulations for the defendant's product. In my view, neither of the cases cited supports the plaintiffs' claim that harm to its general reputation arising solely from competition by Apotex should be recognized as harm for which damages at law might not be an adequate remedy.\n\n[45]\nLoss of market share or profit margin has been a factor in a finding that harm is not adequately compensated by damages, warranting an interlocutory injunction, in certain circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  injunction in circumstances he characterized as unique where the defendant had a long-standing contract to use the plaintiff's patented product and then proposed to bring to market its own product which was alleged to infringe the plaintiff's patent. There is no such contractual relationship between Apotex and Merck in this case. In\nCabot Corp. et al. v. 3M Canada Inc.\n(1987), 10 F.T.R. 210; 15 C.P.R.(3d) 247 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Joyal similarly granted an injunction pending trial of an action by a patent holder claiming infringement of its patented earplug product by the defendant who planned to introduce a competing product into the market, in circumstances where he found the factors affecting the parties' interests were evenly balanced and preserving the status quo by granting an injunction seemed warranted, following Lord Diplock in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1975] 1 All E.R. 504. In that case the status quo was considered to be the market situation at the time relief was sought, before the defendant entered the market. In my view, the circumstances before me differ. In\nCabot\nthe defendant's sales projections were minimal in relation to the total market and in relation to the defendant's total projected sales of all its products, and the defendant had not invested except in the inventory of the product provided by its U.S. parent. Here projected sales of Apotex are substantial; they are expected to attract a large share of the market, and they result from substantial capital investment by the defendant in a product which may, because of its relatively short shelf life, deteriorate and be of no value for sale if the defendant is enjoined from selling pending trial and then must await later listing in provincial drug formularies for some months after trial. In short, the stakes appear higher for the defendant Apotex, if an injunction should now issue, than they were for the defendant in\nCabot\n, and the plaintiffs' case here is not as strong as that of the plaintiff in that case, for there the plaintiff's patent had been upheld as valid in proceedings in Germany and it was ready to go to trial in this country in an unrelated action where validity of its Canadian patent would be determined.\n\n[46]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 493, Madame Justice Reed granted an interlocutory injunction in a case where she found clear evidence of infringement of patents for products in a market in a great state of flux. New industry standards indicated possible changes of significance in market share among competitors and business relationships established after adoption of new industry standards would have a long-term effect that could not easily be quantified. In such a case she found that monetary damages would not be adequate to remedy the harm arising from lost sales which resulted in a substantial loss of market share. Those circumstances, warranting an interlocutory injunction pending trial, are not present in the case at bar, in my view. The relative strengths of each party's case is here not so clearly determined at this stage, the market for the products here in issue is not subject to the same uncertainty as anticipated new industry standards presented in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and the market in this case will be served not from numerous sources but only by the plaintiffs if an injunction is granted, and if not, then by the two parties here involved. In the latter case, if no injunction issues, the plaintiffs' loss of market share and of sales will be readily calculable by sales made by the defendant who can be required to keep appropriate accounts pending trial.\n\n[47]\nIn my view, none of the cases referred to are definitive in determining that harm claimed by the plaintiffs may not be adequately compensated by damages following trial. Moreover, there are cases which support the conclusion that harm from loss of sales or profit margin and market share that may arise from sales of a generic brand of a pharmaceutical prescription product, which is substituted for the original brand because of lower prices, are readily quantifiable and adequately compensated by an award of damages [see footnote 3].\n\n[48]\nOne circumstance in this case, already referred to, relates to the harm anticipated by the plaintiffs if no injunction now issues. It is not unreasonable to expect trial of the action to be within six months. In that period Apotex's sales under provincial regulatory systems for drug substitution will have been made from September 1993 in British Columbia, but substantially only from January 1994 in all other provinces. In that time, in my view any loss in goodwill or reputation, if it be proven, can be compensated by damages, and loss of sales and market share can be calculated by reference to sales by Apotex, and loss of profits to the plaintiffs can be accounted for by adjusting those sales for the price differential between the products of the parties. If the plaintiffs succeed at trial in my opinion the harm suffered in the period pending trial will be adequately compensated by an appropriate award of damages.\nConclusion\n\n[49]\nI conclude, reflecting the words of Stone, J.A., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1, at p. 19, that the plaintiffs' recoverable damages resulting from continuance of the defendant's activities pending trial would be an adequate remedy. No question is raised about the defendant's ability to pay damages that may be awarded if the plaintiffs succeed at trial.\n\n[50]\nIn light of that conclusion other factors argued need not be determined. In particular, the defendant's concern that the plaintiffs have delayed unduly in seeking injunctive relief is only relevant if I were persuaded that an injunction should be seriously considered. If it were necessary to rule on that issue, it is my view that the plaintiffs have adequately explained why application was not earlier made in this action begun nearly two years ago, essentially because until the defendant had an NOC they had no authorization to see \"Apo-Enalapril\" in Canada and the case for claiming irreparable harm would have been even more difficult to make.\n\n[51]\nWere it necessary to resolve the differences between the parties as to the situation to be preserved if preservation of the status quo were a determining factor in this application, in my view the situation to be recognized is that urged by the defendant. That is that the defendants had commenced the process of seeking an NOC before the patent in issue was granted to the plaintiffs, its entitlement to an NOC has been determined by this court, and that notice has now been issued, subject only to reversal and cancellation of the NOC if the plaintiffs are successful in the appeal recently heard by the Court of Appeal. (See generally,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 129, at pp. 138-139.) In these circumstances preservation of the status quo would support the conclusion that an interlocutory injunction pending trial should not issue.\n\n[52]\nWhile I decline to grant relief by an injunction pending trial, the alternative relief claimed in the plaintiffs' application, while it was not argued at the hearing, is entirely appropriate. The defendant cannot seriously object to an order requiring the maintenance of appropriate records and accounts pending trial, just as it has been required to do since this application was first heard for interim relief on September 2, 1993 and then adjourned on terms.\n\n[53]\nAn order will go dismissing the plaintiffs' application for an interlocutory injunction pending trial, but allowing their application for an order that the defendant maintain records and accounts. Counsel for the parties are asked to consult on the terms of an order directing the maintenance of accounts and, if they can agree on terms by November 1, 1993, to submit those in form of a draft order consistent with these reasons, pursuant to rule 324(1). If the terms are not agreed upon the court will of its own motion resolve those terms, taking into account any representations either party may wish to submit in writing.\n\n[54]\nFinally, with a view to exploring how trial of the action may be expedited and to consider the development of a schedule for pretrial preparations, if that be desirable, counsel are invited to arrange with the office of the Associate Chief Justice for a pretrial conference, by telephone conference call or by appearance.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Reginald W.

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court determined that the plaintiffs (Merck) had not established irreparable harm sufficient to warrant an interlocutory injunction, despite the potential loss of market share. It found that damages would be an adequate remedy for any harm suffered during the period before trial (estimated at six months), as lost sales and profits could be calculated based on Apotex’s sales and the price differential between the drugs.",
      "The court distinguished this case from precedents where injunctions were granted, finding that the circumstances were not analogous. Specifically, it noted the absence of a contractual relationship between the parties, the lack of a unique market situation, and the ability to quantify damages.",
      "The court acknowledged that the evidence presented was not identical to that considered in previous proceedings (the stay application before Justice Gibson and the appeal to the Court of Appeal) but was similar enough that it wasn't barred by issue estoppel. It reasoned that the current application concerned the rights of private parties *after* the issuance of a Notice of Compliance (NOC), whereas the prior proceedings concerned the Minister’s decision regarding the NOC itself.",
      "The court applied the tripartite test for interlocutory injunctions (as outlined in *Stone v. Boots Drug Stores Ltd.*), emphasizing the need to consider the balance of convenience. It ultimately concluded that the balance favored denying the injunction, as Apotex had already invested significantly in developing and manufacturing the generic drug and would suffer harm if prevented from entering the market, even temporarily.",
      "The court interpreted section 56 of the Patent Act as potentially providing a defense for Apotex, as they had acquired the bulk enalapril maleate before Merck’s patent was issued. The court did not definitively rule on the validity of this defense but acknowledged it as a key issue to be resolved at trial.",
      "The court found that the plaintiffs’ concerns about damage to their reputation and the value of their patent were speculative and not sufficient to establish irreparable harm. It reasoned that competition from a generic drug did not necessarily diminish a brand’s reputation and that the patent’s value would only be affected if Apotex’s defenses were successful at trial.",
      "The court determined that preserving the status quo meant recognizing Apotex’s entitlement to the NOC, which had been granted after a court order and was subject only to potential reversal on appeal. This supported the decision to deny the injunction."
