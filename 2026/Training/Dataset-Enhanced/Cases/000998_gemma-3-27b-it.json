    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 660)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nNoël, J.\nJuly 7, 2014.\nCounsel:\nRadu Ghergus, for the applicant;\nSherry Rafai Far, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nRadu Ghergus Law Firm, Montreal, Quebec, for the applicant;\nWilliam F. Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI. Introduction",
    "[1]\nNoël, J.\n: This is an application for judicial brought under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] in relation to a decision dated January 21, 2013 by a visa officer with the Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong rejecting the Applicant's application for a permanent resident visa [APR] in Canada as a member of the investor class.\nII. Facts",
    "[2]\nThe Applicant is a citizen of China who applied for permanent residency in Canada in the investor class on January 4, 2011.",
    "[3]\nOn January 21, 2013, the Applicant was interviewed by the visa officer at the Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong. During this interview, he was questioned at length about his possible membership in associations in his home country including the Chinese government.",
    "[4]\nThe visa officer rendered the impugned decision on the same day, denying the APR on the ground that the Applicant failed to be truthful in answering questions.\nIII. Decision under review",
    "[5]\nThe visa officer's decision is based on what was perceived as a contradiction in the Applicant's story as it concerns his association with organizations or the Chinese government. On one hand, the Applicant claimed never to have been a member of an organization or in any way affiliated with the Chinese government, and on the other hand, a Chinese government website listed the Applicant as a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Standing Committee. The visa officer stated that the Applicant was offered the opportunity during the interview to address these concerns that he had not been truthful regarding his affiliation with the Communist Party of China or with the Chinese government body.",
    "[6]\nTherefore, the visa officer concluded that the Applicant had not answered the questions truthfully pursuant to section 16 of the IRPA and accordingly dismissed his claim.\nIV. Issue",
    "[7]\nThis judicial review and the parties' arguments raise two issues to be addressed by the Court:\nA. Did the visa officer err in determining that the Applicant had not been truthful in answering the questions he was asked as required by section 16 of the IRPA?\nB. Did the visa officer breach procedural fairness by not providing the Applicant with an opportunity to respond to the government website stating that he was a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee?\nV. Standard of review",
    "[8]\nBeing fact-driven, the first issue shall be addressed under the standard of reasonableness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 204 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). This standard calls for great deference and requires that this Court consider \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\" and \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] SCJ No 9). The second issue relates to procedural fairness, and such questions are reviewable under the standard of correctness (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 10;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ No 674). No deference is owed to the decision-maker following this standard.\nVI. Applicant's submissions",
    "[9]\nThe visa officer's decision must be set aside because it is based on misconstruction of evidence and because it is the result of a breach of natural justice.",
    "[10]\nThe visa officer found that the Applicant was a member of the \"Communist Party Standing Committee\", but the Applicant testified that he had never been a member of the Communist Party. The Applicant was a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee, which stands for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and not of the Chinese Communist Party, and unlike what the visa officer's decision conveys the CPPCC is not a part of the Chinese government. Rather, it is a consultative conference formed of various political and non political actors, including members of the clergy.",
    "[11]\nFurthermore, the visa officer breached procedural fairness by relying on information, namely the Chinese government website listing him as a member of the CPPCC, without giving him the adequate opportunity to respond and prove that he was not a member of the Chinese Communist Party.\nVII. Respondent's submissions",
    "[12]\nThe visa officer's decision was reasonable because the Applicant was under the obligation to be truthful in his application, yet he failed to disclose that he had been a member of the CPPCC. The Applicant's explanation at the interview was contradicted by the evidence submitted, and this lead to a finding of fact which should not be disturbed. In fact, the Applicant acknowledged during this interview that he was a member of the CPPCC, and he even claimed to have been a member for six years before the interview. Also, the visa officer never made a specific finding that the Applicant was a member of the Chinese Communist Party but was simply asking questions on the issue. As for the question of the CPPCC Standing Committee being a government organization or not, it is not important - the Applicant had to be truthful in his application and reveal any affiliation, and he did not.",
    "[13]\nAs for the alleged breach of procedural fairness, the Applicant was confronted with the evidence but did not request more time to present any evidence of his own. Also, the Applicant never mentioned during the interview that the CPPCC is not a government affiliated organization.\nVIII. Applicant's reply",
    "[14]\nIn his reply, the Applicant mostly argues that it would have been impossible for him to say that he was member of the CPPCC Standing Committee at the time of his application because he filed his APR in January 2011, i.e. before becoming a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee in April 2011. Also, the Applicant was not a member of this Standing Committee for six years - rather he was invited to attend certain meetings as a guest.\nIX. Analysis",
    "[15]\nAlthough far from perfect, the visa officer's decision is nonetheless reasonable and this application for judicial review shall be dismissed.\nA.\nDid the visa officer err in determining that the Applicant had not been truthful in answering the questions he was asked as required by section 16 of the IRPA?",
    "[16]\nDuring his interview with the visa officer, the Applicant was confronted with his written application in which he denied being a member of any Chinese social or political organization, as well as with a document stating that he had been, at a certain point, a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee. After questioning the Applicant on the issue, the visa officer concluded that the Applicant had not answered all the questions truthfully, as required by section 16 of the IRPA which provides as follows:\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\nPART 1\nIMMIGRATION TO CANADA\nDivision 2\nExamination\nObligation - answer\ntruthfully\n16.\n(1) A person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce a visa and all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires.\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection de réfugiés\n, LC 2001, ch 27\nPARTIE 1\nIMMIGRATION AU CANADA\nSection 2\nContrôle\nObligation du demandeur\n16.\n(1) L'auteur d'une demande au titre de la présente loi doit répondre véridiquement aux questions qui lui sont posées lors du contrôle, donner les renseignements et tous éléments de preuve pertinents et présenter les visa et documents requis.",
    "[17]\nThe question this Court must answer is whether the Applicant, at the time of his application and during his examination - in other words during his interview - was truthful in answering questions.",
    "[18]\nAt question 12 of his APR, the Applicant declared that he had never been a member of any organization and that he had never been associated with any organization. According to the application form, the term \"organization\" includes any political and social organization. The Applicant was asked this same question during the interview: \"I WOULD LIKE TO CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE DECLARED THAT YOU HAVE NEVER BELONGED TO ANY SUCH ORGANIZATION - IS THAT CORRECT? Yes, I confirm that.\" (Visa officer's Global Case Management System [GCMS] notes, Certified Tribunal Record [CTR], at page 4) It was after this question that the visa officer confronted the Applicant with the document mentioning him as a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee. In fact, the Applicant was extensively questioned on this issue. One of the questions asked was \"WHEN DID YOU FIRST JOIN THIS STANDING COMMITTEE\", to which the Applicant answered  About six years ago.  (Visa officer GCMS notes, CTR, at page 4)",
    "[19]\nIn his factum, the Applicant goes to great lengths to establish that he was under no obligation to mention that he belonged to this Standing Committee as he only became a member in April 2011, i.e. a few months after filing his APR in January of that same year. According to the Applicant, prior to becoming a member he had only attended the meetings as a guest. In addition to being in direct contradiction to his answer that he had joined the CPPCC Standing Committee about six years prior to the interview, the Applicant's argument in this regard was put forward in this application for judicial review only - although he was asked on many occasions during the interview to be more specific with respect to the period covered by his membership in the Standing Committee, he never mentioned that he joined the Standing Committee in April 2011. The Applicant should have brought up this issue at the time of the interview. What is more, the argument is substantiated by the evidence in the Applicant's record that was not before the visa officer and that should therefore not be considered in these proceedings (see for example  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2013] FCJ No 586;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2003] FCJ No 1596).",
    "[20]\nThe Applicant also takes issue with the fact that the visa officer insisted on the fact that the CPPCC is a Chinese government organization. It is true that the visa officer adopted a somewhat truncated approach to the ties between the CPPCC and the Chinese Communist Party, going as far as telling the Applicant that they had \"INFORMATION [...] DESCRIBING [him] AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY STANDING COMMITTEE.\" (Visa Officer's GCMS notes, CTR, at page 4) Nevertheless, this Court finds that this error, while most inelegant, is not material. The Applicant was required to mention his membership in any organization, including social and political organizations, and one could difficultly argue that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is not, in some way, political in nature.",
    "[21]\nIn addition, contrary to the Applicant's argument, the visa officer never found that the Applicant was a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Questions on the matter were asked, but no specific findings were made.",
    "[22]\nThat being said, the one finding that was made was that the Applicant had not been truthful in answering questions. As stated above, the reviewing court's role is limited and it must not interfere with the decision-maker's decision if the underlying process is justified, transparent and intelligible and if the result falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. Considering the evidence with which the visa officer had been presented and the answers provided by the Applicant during his interview, it was reasonable to conclude that the Applicant had been a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee for several years prior to filing his application and that, having failed to report it in his application and at the interview, he did not answer the questions truthfully as required by section 16 of the IRPA (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2013] FCJ No 730).\nB.\nDid the visa officer breach procedural fairness by not providing the Applicant with an opportunity to respond to the government website stating that he was a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee?",
    "[23]\nThe Applicant claims that he was not offered the opportunity to reply to the visa officer's concerns regarding his membership in the CPPCC Standing Committee. This Court finds, however, that the Applicant was in fact confronted with the evidence relied upon by the visa officer during the interview and offered a possibility of responding to this evidence.",
    "[24]\nIn fact, as found above, the Applicant was extensively questioned on the issue and it resulted from this questioning that the Applicant acknowledged having joined the CPPCC Standing Committee six years prior to the interview.",
    "[25]\nWhat is more, in his factum the Applicant argues that he should have been enabled to \"bring to the interview evidence of his status as a former independent member of the CPPCC and that the CPPCC is an advisory body not a government one.\" (Applicant's Memorandum, at para 24.) It can thus be inferred that the Applicant would have liked to provide evidence on two matters, both of which are not relevant to the determination of this application and are of no avail to his claims in these proceedings. First, the \"independence\" of the Applicant as a member of the CPPCC is a non-issue because, independent or not, the Applicant was a member of this Standing Committee and failed to acknowledge it even if he was required to do so. Second, proving that the Standing Committee was not a government institution would have been of no help to the Applicant because, as its name suggests, the CPPCC Standing Committee was nonetheless a political association.",
    "[26]\nConsequently, this Court finds that not only was the Applicant provided the opportunity to address the visa officer's concerns regarding his standing in the CPPCC, but the evidence he claims he should have been given an opportunity to present would have had no impact on the issue of the matter. Therefore, this Court further finds that the visa officer did not breach procedural fairness.",
    "[27]\nThe parties were invited to submit a question for certification, but none were proposed.\nORDER",
    "[28]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS\nthat this application for judicial review is dismissed and no question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Christmas\n[Translation]: The Court is seized of an application for judicial review, made under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act,\nLC 2001, c 27 [LIPR] of the decision dated January 21, 2013 by which a visa officer, of the Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong, rejected the application for a permanent resident visa [DRP] to Canada filed by the applicant under the investor category.\nII.\nFacts"

Pendant l'entrevue, le demandeur a été longuement questionné sur sa possible appartenance à des associations dans son pays d'origine, y compris le gouvernement chinois.\n[4]\nL'agent des visas a rendu la décision attaquée le même jour, rejetant la DRP au motif que le demandeur n'avait pas répondu véridiquement aux questions.\nIII.\nDécision faisant l'objet du contrôle\n[5]\nL'agent des visas a fondé sa décision sur ce qu'il avait perçu comme une contradiction dans le récit du demandeur relativement à l'association de celui-ci avec des organisations ou avec le gouvernement chinois. D'une part, le demandeur affirmait n'avoir jamais été membre d'une organisation ni affilié de quelque façon au gouvernement chinois, et, d'autre part, le demandeur figurait comme membre du comité permanent de la Conférence consultative politique du peuple chinois [CCPPC] sur un site Web gouvernemental. L'agent des visas a déclaré que le demandeur avait eu la possibilité de s'expliquer là-dessus pendant l'entrevue, mais qu'il n'avait pas dit la vérité sur son affiliation avec le Parti communiste chinois ou avec l'organe du gouvernement chinois.\n[6]\nPar conséquent, l'agent des visas a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas répondu véridiquement aux questions au sens de l'article 12 de la LIPR et a rejeté la demande.\nIV.\nQuestions en litige\n[7]\nLe présent contrôle judiciaire et les arguments des parties soulèvent deux questions que la Cour devra trancher\n:\nL'agent des visas a-t-il commis une erreur en déterminant que le demandeur n'avait pas répondu véridiquement aux questions qui lui avaient été posées, comme il était tenu de le faire aux termes de l'article 16 de la LIPR?\nL'agent des visas a-t-il manqué à l'équité procédurale en ne donnant pas au demandeur la possibilité de s'expliquer sur la question du site Web gouvernemental qui le présentait comme un membre du comité permanent de la CCPPC?\nV.\nNorme de contrôle\n[8]\nComme elle repose sur les faits, la première question sera contrôlée selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 204 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Cette norme appelle une grande retenue et exige que la Cour s'intéresse  à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit  (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] ACS no 9). La deuxième question a trait à l'équité procédurale, et de telles questions sont susceptibles de révision selon la norme de la décision correcte (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 10;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] ACF no 674). Selon cette norme, la Cour n'est pas tenue de faire preuve de déférence envers le décideur.\nVI.\nObservations du demandeur\n[9]\nLa décision de l'agent des visas doit être annulée parce qu'elle est fondée sur une mauvaise interprétation de la preuve et qu'elle résulte d'un manquement à la justice naturelle.\n[10]\nL'agent des visas a conclu que le demandeur était membre du [traduction]  comité permanent du Parti communiste , mais le demandeur a témoigné n'avoir jamais été membre du Parti communiste. Le demandeur était membre du comité permanent de la CCPPC, qui signifie Conférence consultative politique du peuple chinois, et non du Parti communiste, et contrairement au message que véhicule la décision de l'agent des visas, la CCPPC ne fait pas partie du gouvernement chinois. Il s'agit plutôt d'un groupe consultatif formé de divers acteurs politiques et non politiques, dont des membres du clergé.\n[11]\nDe plus, l'agent des visas a manqué à l'équité procédurale en se fiant à de l'information, à savoir un site Web du gouvernement chinois qui le présentait comme un membre de la CCPPC, sans lui donner une possibilité adéquate de s'expliquer et de prouver qu'il n'était pas membre du Parti communiste chinois.\nVII.\nObservations du défendeur\n[12]\nLa décision de l'agent des visas était raisonnable parce que le demandeur avait l'obligation d'être véridique dans sa demande, mais a toutefois omis de révéler qu'il avait été membre de la CCPPC. Les éléments de preuve produits ont contredit l'explication donnée par le demandeur lors de l'entrevue, ce qui a mené à une conclusion de fait qui ne doit pas être modifiée. En fait, le demandeur a reconnu pendant l'entrevue être membre de la CCPPC, et a même affirmé qu'il en faisait partie depuis six ans. De plus, l'agent des visas n'a jamais expressément conclu que le demandeur était membre du Parti communiste chinois, mais il a simplement posé des questions à ce sujet. La question de savoir si le comité permanent de la CCPPC est une organisation gouvernementale ou non n'a pas d'importance - le demandeur devait être véridique dans sa demande et révéler toute affiliation, mais il ne l'a pas fait.\n[13]\nEn ce qui concerne le manquement allégué à l'équité procédurale, les éléments de preuve ont été signalés au demandeur, mais celui-ci n'a pas demandé plus de temps pour présenter ses propres éléments de preuve. En outre, le demandeur n'a jamais mentionné pendant l'entrevue que la CCPPC n'était pas une organisation affiliée au gouvernement.\nVIII.\nRéponse du demandeur\n[14]\nDans sa réponse, le demandeur affirme surtout qu'il n'aurait pas pu mentionner qu'il faisait partie du comité permanent de la CCPPC au moment de sa demande, parce qu'il avait présenté sa DRP en janvier 2011, c'est-à-dire avant de devenir membre du comité permanent de la CCPPC en avril 2011. Le demandeur ajoute qu'il n'était pas membre de ce comité permanent depuis six ans - il avait plutôt été convié à assister à certaines réunions à titre d'invité.\nIX.\nAnalyse\n[15]\nBien qu'elle soit loin d'être parfaite, la décision de l'agent des visas est néanmoins raisonnable, et la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée.\nA.\nL'agent des visas a-t-il commis une erreur en déterminant que le demandeur n'avait pas été véridique en répondant aux questions qui lui avaient été posées, comme il était tenu de le faire aux termes de l'article 16 de la LIPR?\n[16]\nDurant son entrevue avec l'agent des visas, le demandeur a été mis en présence de sa demande écrite dans laquelle il affirmait n'être membre d'aucune organisation sociale ou politique chinoise, et d'un document indiquant qu'il avait été, à un moment donné, membre du comité permanent de la CCPPC. Après avoir questionné le demandeur à ce sujet, l'agent des visas a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas répondu véridiquement à toutes les questions, comme l'exige l'article 16 de la LIPR, ainsi rédigé:\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection de réfugiés\n, LC 2001, c 27\nPARTIE 1\nIMMIGRATION AU CANADA\nSection 2\nContrôle\nObligation du demandeur\n16.\n(1) L'auteur d'une demande au titre de la présente loi doit répondre véridiquement aux questions qui lui sont posées lors du contrôle, donner les renseignements et tous éléments de preuve pertinents et présenter les visa et documents requis.\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\nPART 1\nIMMIGRATION TO CANADA\nDivision 2\nExamination\nObligation - answer\ntruthfully\n16.\n(1) A person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce a visa and all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires.\n[17]\nLa Cour est appelée à décider si le demandeur, au moment de sa demande et lors du contrôle - autrement dit durant son entrevue - a répondu véridiquement aux questions.\n[18]\nÀ la question 12 de sa DRP, le demandeur a répondu n'avoir jamais été membre d'une quelconque organisation, ni associé à une quelconque organisation. Selon le formulaire de demande, le terme  organisation  comprend toute organisation politique et sociale. La même question a été posée au demandeur pendant l'entrevue: [traduction]  J'AIMERAIS CONFIRMER QUE VOUS AVEZ DÉCLARÉ N'AVOIR JAMAIS ÉTÉ MEMBRE D'UNE TELLE ORGANISATION - EST-CE EXACT? Oui, je le confirme  (notes consignées par l'agent des visas dans le Système mondial de gestion des cas [SMGC], dossier certifié du tribunal [DCT], page 4). C'est après avoir posé cette question que l'agent des visas a présenté au demandeur le document dans lequel celui-ci était désigné à titre de membre du comité permanent de la CCPPC. En fait, le demandeur a été longuement questionné à ce sujet. L'agent des visas lui a notamment posé la question suivante: [traduction]  QUAND ÊTES-VOUS TOUT D'ABORD DEVENU MEMBRE DE CE COMITÉ PERMANENT?  Le demandeur a répondu: [traduction]  Il y a environ six ans  (notes consignées par l'agent des visas dans le SMGC, DCT, page 4).\n[19]\nDans son mémoire, le demandeur se donne bien du mal pour établir qu'il n'avait pas l'obligation de mentionner qu'il était faisait partie de ce comité permanent, étant donné qu'il en était devenu membre en avril 2011 seulement, c'est-à-dire quelques mois après le dépôt de sa DRP en janvier de la même année. Selon le demandeur, avant d'en devenir membre, il avait assisté aux réunions du comité uniquement à titre d'invité. En plus de contredire directement sa réponse selon laquelle il était devenu membre du comité permanent de la CCPPC environ six ans avant l'entrevue, cet argument a été avancé uniquement dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire - bien que le demandeur ait été maintes fois prié durant l'entrevue de préciser pendant quelle période il avait fait partie du comité permanent, il n'a jamais dit qu'il en était devenu membre en avril 2011. Le demandeur aurait dû en parler au moment de l'entrevue. Qui plus est, l'argument est étayé dans le dossier du demandeur par des éléments de preuve qui n'avaient pas été présentés à l'agent des visas et qui ne doivent donc pas être pris en considération dans la présente instance (voir, par exemple,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2013] ACF no 586;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2003] ACF no 1596).\n[20]\nLe demandeur reproche également à l'agent des visas d'avoir insisté sur le fait que la CCPPC est une organisation gouvernementale chinoise. Il est vrai que l'agent des visas a adopté une approche quelque peu tronquée à l'égard des liens entre la CCPPC et le Parti communiste chinois, allant jusqu'à dire au demandeur qu'il avait [traduction]  DE L'INFORMATION [...] LE DÉCRIVANT COMME UN MEMBRE DU COMITÉ PERMANENT DU PARTI COMMUNISTE  (notes consignées par l'agent des visas dans le SMGC, DCT, page 4). Néanmoins, la Cour estime que cette erreur, plutôt grossière, ne tire pas à conséquence. Le demandeur était tenu de mentionner son appartenance à toute organisation, y compris à des organisations sociales et politiques, et il serait difficile d'affirmer que la Conférence consultative politique du peuple chinois n'est pas, en quelque sorte, une organisation politique de nature.\n[21]\nEn outre, contrairement à ce qu'avance le demandeur, l'agent des visas n'a jamais conclu que le demandeur était membre du Parti communiste chinois. Des questions ont été posées à ce sujet, mais aucune conclusion particulière n'a été tirée.\n[22]\nCeci étant dit, la seule conclusion qui a été tirée était que le demandeur n'avait pas répondu véridiquement aux questions. Comme il a été mentionné ci-dessus, la cour de révision a un rôle limité et ne doit pas s'ingérer dans la décision du décideur si le processus décisionnel est justifié, transparent et intelligible, et si la décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Compte tenu des éléments de preuve qui avaient été présentés à l'agent des visas et des réponses données par le demandeur durant son entrevue, il était raisonnable de conclure que le demandeur avait été membre du Comité permanent de la CCPPC pendant plusieurs années avant de déposer sa demande et que, ayant omis d'indiquer ce fait dans sa demande et lors de l'entrevue, il n'avait pas répondu véridiquement aux questions comme il était tenu de le faire aux termes de l'article 16 de la LIPR (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 39, [2013] ACF no 730).\nB.\nL'agent des visas a-t-il manqué à l'équité procédurale en ne donnant pas au demandeur l'occasion de s'expliquer sur la question du site Web gouvernemental qui le présentait comme un membre du comité permanent de la CCPPC?\n[23]\nLe demandeur soutient ne pas avoir eu la possibilité de dissiper les doutes de l'agent des visas quant à son appartenance au comité permanent de la CPPC. La Cour conclut cependant que l'agent des visas a bel et bien présenté au demandeur les éléments de preuve sur lesquels il s'était fondé et qu'il a offert au demandeur la possibilité de s'expliquer sur ce point lors de l'entrevue.\n[24]\nEn fait, comme il a été conclu ci-dessus, le demandeur a été longuement questionné sur ce point, et c'est à la suite de cet interrogatoire que le demandeur a reconnu qu'il était devenu membre du comité consultatif de la CCPPC six ans avant l'entrevue.\n[25]\nDe surcroît, le demandeur soutient dans son mémoire qu'il aurait dû être autorisé à [traduction]  présenter lors de l'entrevue des éléments de preuve établissant son statut d'ancien membre indépendant de la CCPPC, et établissant que la CCPPC est un organe consultatif et non gouvernemental  (mémoire du demandeur, au paragraphe 24). Il pourrait donc être inféré que le demandeur aurait voulu produire des éléments de preuve sur deux points, qui ne sont ni l'un ni l'autre pertinents pour l'issue de la présente demande et qui n'appuient en rien ses allégations en l'espèce. Premièrement, l' indépendance  du demandeur à titre de membre de la CCPPC n'est pas un point litigieux, parce que, indépendant ou non, le demandeur était membre de ce comité permanent et a omis de le révéler même s'il avait l'obligation de le faire. Deuxièmement, prouver que le comité permanent n'était pas une institution gouvernementale n'aurait été d'aucun secours pour le demandeur parce que, comme son nom l'indique, le comité permanent de la CCPPC était tout de même une association politique.\n[26]\nPar conséquent, la Cour conclut que non seulement le demandeur a eu la possibilité de dissiper les doutes de l'agent des visas à propos de son statut au sein de la CCPPC, mais aussi que les éléments de preuve que le demandeur aurait dû, selon lui, être autorisé à produire n'auraient eu aucune incidence sur l'issue de l'affaire. Ainsi, la Cour conclut en outre que l'agent des visas n'a pas manqué à l'équité procédurale.\n[27]\nLes parties ont été invitées à proposer une question susceptible d'être certifiée, mais elles n'en ont proposé aucune.\nORDONNANCE\n[28]\nLA COUR STATUE\nque la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Aucune question n'est certifiée.\n[End of document]",

Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI. Introduction\n\n[1]\nNoël, J.\n: This is an application for judicial brought under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] in relation to a decision dated January 21, 2013 by a visa officer with the Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong rejecting the Applicant's application for a permanent resident visa [APR] in Canada as a member of the investor class.\nII. Facts\n\n[2]\nThe Applicant is a citizen of China who applied for permanent residency in Canada in the investor class on January 4, 2011.\n\n[3]\nOn January 21, 2013, the Applicant was interviewed by the visa officer at the Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong. During this interview, he was questioned at length about his possible membership in associations in his home country including the Chinese government.\n\n[4]\nThe visa officer rendered the impugned decision on the same day, denying the APR on the ground that the Applicant failed to be truthful in answering questions.\nIII. Decision under review\n\n[5]\nThe visa officer's decision is based on what was perceived as a contradiction in the Applicant's story as it concerns his association with organizations or the Chinese government. On one hand, the Applicant claimed never to have been a member of an organization or in any way affiliated with the Chinese government, and on the other hand, a Chinese government website listed the Applicant as a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Standing Committee. The visa officer stated that the Applicant was offered the opportunity during the interview to address these concerns that he had not been truthful regarding his affiliation with the Communist Party of China or with the Chinese government body.\n\n[6]\nTherefore, the visa officer concluded that the Applicant had not answered the questions truthfully pursuant to section 16 of the IRPA and accordingly dismissed his claim.\nIV. Issue\n\n[7]\nThis judicial review and the parties' arguments raise two issues to be addressed by the Court:\nA. Did the visa officer err in determining that the Applicant had not been truthful in answering the questions he was asked as required by section 16 of the IRPA?\nB. Did the visa officer breach procedural fairness by not providing the Applicant with an opportunity to respond to the government website stating that he was a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee?\nV. Standard of review\n\n[8]\nBeing fact-driven, the first issue shall be addressed under the standard of reasonableness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 204 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). This standard calls for great deference and requires that this Court consider \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\" and \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] SCJ No 9). The second issue relates to procedural fairness, and such questions are reviewable under the standard of correctness (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 10;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ No 674). No deference is owed to the decision-maker following this standard.\nVI. Applicant's submissions\n\n[9]\nThe visa officer's decision must be set aside because it is based on misconstruction of evidence and because it is the result of a breach of natural justice.\n\n[10]\nThe visa officer found that the Applicant was a member of the \"Communist Party Standing Committee\", but the Applicant testified that he had never been a member of the Communist Party. The Applicant was a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee, which stands for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and not of the Chinese Communist Party, and unlike what the visa officer's decision conveys the CPPCC is not a part of the Chinese government. Rather, it is a consultative conference formed of various political and non political actors, including members of the clergy.\n\n[11]\nFurthermore, the visa officer breached procedural fairness by relying on information, namely the Chinese government website listing him as a member of the CPPCC, without giving him the adequate opportunity to respond and prove that he was not a member of the Chinese Communist Party.\nVII. Respondent's submissions\n\n[12]\nThe visa officer's decision was reasonable because the Applicant was under the obligation to be truthful in his application, yet he failed to disclose that he had been a member of the CPPCC. The Applicant's explanation at the interview was contradicted by the evidence submitted, and this lead to a finding of fact which should not be disturbed. In fact, the Applicant acknowledged during this interview that he was a member of the CPPCC, and he even claimed to have been a member for six years before the interview. Also, the visa officer never made a specific finding that the Applicant was a member of the Chinese Communist Party but was simply asking questions on the issue. As for the question of the CPPCC Standing Committee being a government organization or not, it is not important - the Applicant had to be truthful in his application and reveal any affiliation, and he did not.\n\n[13]\nAs for the alleged breach of procedural fairness, the Applicant was confronted with the evidence but did not request more time to present any evidence of his own. Also, the Applicant never mentioned during the interview that the CPPCC is not a government affiliated organization.\nVIII. Applicant's reply\n\n[14]\nIn his reply, the Applicant mostly argues that it would have been impossible for him to say that he was member of the CPPCC Standing Committee at the time of his application because he filed his APR in January 2011, i.e. before becoming a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee in April 2011. Also, the Applicant was not a member of this Standing Committee for six years - rather he was invited to attend certain meetings as a guest.\nIX. Analysis\n\n[15]\nAlthough far from perfect, the visa officer's decision is nonetheless reasonable and this application for judicial review shall be dismissed.\nA.\nDid the visa officer err in determining that the Applicant had not been truthful in answering the questions he was asked as required by section 16 of the IRPA?\n\n[16]\nDuring his interview with the visa officer, the Applicant was confronted with his written application in which he denied being a member of any Chinese social or political organization, as well as with a document stating that he had been, at a certain point, a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee. After questioning the Applicant on the issue, the visa officer concluded that the Applicant had not answered all the questions truthfully, as required by section 16 of the IRPA which provides as follows:\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\nPART 1\nIMMIGRATION TO CANADA\nDivision 2\nExamination\nObligation - answer\ntruthfully\n16.\n(1) A person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce a visa and all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires.\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection de réfugiés\n, LC 2001, ch 27\nPARTIE 1\nIMMIGRATION AU CANADA\nSection 2\nContrôle\nObligation du demandeur\n16.\n(1) L'auteur d'une demande au titre de la présente loi doit répondre véridiquement aux questions qui lui sont posées lors du contrôle, donner les renseignements et tous éléments de preuve pertinents et présenter les visa et documents requis.\n\n[17]\nThe question this Court must answer is whether the Applicant, at the time of his application and during his examination - in other words during his interview - was truthful in answering questions.\n\n[18]\nAt question 12 of his APR, the Applicant declared that he had never been a member of any organization and that he had never been associated with any organization. According to the application form, the term \"organization\" includes any political and social organization. The Applicant was asked this same question during the interview: \"I WOULD LIKE TO CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE DECLARED THAT YOU HAVE NEVER BELONGED TO ANY SUCH ORGANIZATION - IS THAT CORRECT? Yes, I confirm that.\" (Visa officer's Global Case Management System [GCMS] notes, Certified Tribunal Record [CTR], at page 4) It was after this question that the visa officer confronted the Applicant with the document mentioning him as a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee. In fact, the Applicant was extensively questioned on this issue. One of the questions asked was \"WHEN DID YOU FIRST JOIN THIS STANDING COMMITTEE\", to which the Applicant answered  About six years ago.  (Visa officer GCMS notes, CTR, at page 4)\n\n[19]\nIn his factum, the Applicant goes to great lengths to establish that he was under no obligation to mention that he belonged to this Standing Committee as he only became a member in April 2011, i.e. a few months after filing his APR in January of that same year. According to the Applicant, prior to becoming a member he had only attended the meetings as a guest. In addition to being in direct contradiction to his answer that he had joined the CPPCC Standing Committee about six years prior to the interview, the Applicant's argument in this regard was put forward in this application for judicial review only - although he was asked on many occasions during the interview to be more specific with respect to the period covered by his membership in the Standing Committee, he never mentioned that he joined the Standing Committee in April 2011. The Applicant should have brought up this issue at the time of the interview. What is more, the argument is substantiated by the evidence in the Applicant's record that was not before the visa officer and that should therefore not be considered in these proceedings (see for example  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2013] FCJ No 586;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2003] FCJ No 1596).\n\n[20]\nThe Applicant also takes issue with the fact that the visa officer insisted on the fact that the CPPCC is a Chinese government organization. It is true that the visa officer adopted a somewhat truncated approach to the ties between the CPPCC and the Chinese Communist Party, going as far as telling the Applicant that they had \"INFORMATION [...] DESCRIBING [him] AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY STANDING COMMITTEE.\" (Visa Officer's GCMS notes, CTR, at page 4) Nevertheless, this Court finds that this error, while most inelegant, is not material. The Applicant was required to mention his membership in any organization, including social and political organizations, and one could difficultly argue that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is not, in some way, political in nature.\n\n[21]\nIn addition, contrary to the Applicant's argument, the visa officer never found that the Applicant was a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Questions on the matter were asked, but no specific findings were made.\n\n[22]\nThat being said, the one finding that was made was that the Applicant had not been truthful in answering questions. As stated above, the reviewing court's role is limited and it must not interfere with the decision-maker's decision if the underlying process is justified, transparent and intelligible and if the result falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. Considering the evidence with which the visa officer had been presented and the answers provided by the Applicant during his interview, it was reasonable to conclude that the Applicant had been a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee for several years prior to filing his application and that, having failed to report it in his application and at the interview, he did not answer the questions truthfully as required by section 16 of the IRPA (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2013] FCJ No 730).\nB.\nDid the visa officer breach procedural fairness by not providing the Applicant with an opportunity to respond to the government website stating that he was a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee?\n\n[23]\nThe Applicant claims that he was not offered the opportunity to reply to the visa officer's concerns regarding his membership in the CPPCC Standing Committee. This Court finds, however, that the Applicant was in fact confronted with the evidence relied upon by the visa officer during the interview and offered a possibility of responding to this evidence.\n\n[24]\nIn fact, as found above, the Applicant was extensively questioned on the issue and it resulted from this questioning that the Applicant acknowledged having joined the CPPCC Standing Committee six years prior to the interview.\n\n[25]\nWhat is more, in his factum the Applicant argues that he should have been enabled to \"bring to the interview evidence of his status as a former independent member of the CPPCC and that the CPPCC is an advisory body not a government one.\" (Applicant's Memorandum, at para 24.) It can thus be inferred that the Applicant would have liked to provide evidence on two matters, both of which are not relevant to the determination of this application and are of no avail to his claims in these proceedings. First, the \"independence\" of the Applicant as a member of the CPPCC is a non-issue because, independent or not, the Applicant was a member of this Standing Committee and failed to acknowledge it even if he was required to do so. Second, proving that the Standing Committee was not a government institution would have been of no help to the Applicant because, as its name suggests, the CPPCC Standing Committee was nonetheless a political association.\n\n[26]\nConsequently, this Court finds that not only was the Applicant provided the opportunity to address the visa officer's concerns regarding his standing in the CPPCC, but the evidence he claims he should have been given an opportunity to present would have had no impact on the issue of the matter. Therefore, this Court further finds that the visa officer did not breach procedural fairness.\n\n[27]\nThe parties were invited to submit a question for certification, but none were proposed.\nORDER\n\n[28]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS\nthat this application for judicial review is dismissed and no question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Christmas\n[Translation]: The Court is seized of an application for judicial review, made under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act,\nLC 2001, c 27 [LIPR] of the decision dated January 21, 2013 by which a visa officer, of the Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong, rejected the application for a permanent resident visa [DRP] to Canada filed by the applicant under the investor category.\nII.\nFacts",

      "Regarding procedural fairness, the court found no breach. The applicant was presented with the evidence of his CPPCC membership during the interview and given an opportunity to respond. The court dismissed the argument that the applicant should have been allowed to present evidence regarding the CPPCC's status as a non-governmental organization, finding it irrelevant because the applicant’s membership itself was the issue, regardless of the organization’s governmental affiliation.",
      "The court acknowledged the visa officer's imprecise characterization of the CPPCC's relationship with the Chinese Communist Party as a minor error, but deemed it immaterial to the overall decision. The court reasoned that the CPPCC is inherently political in nature, and the applicant was obligated to disclose his membership regardless.",
      "The court applied the principle that it should not interfere with the decision-maker's findings of fact if the process was reasonable and the outcome defensible, even if not perfect. The court found the visa officer’s conclusion that the applicant was not truthful to be within the range of acceptable outcomes given the evidence."
