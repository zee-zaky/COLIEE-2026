    "[1]\nMcNair, J.\n: This is an appeal by the defendant, Baker Energy Resources Corporation, from an order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary made on September 8, 1988, compelling answers to certain questions put to the defendant's officer on his examination for discovery held on April 22, 1987. The appeal is from that part of the prothonotary's order which ordered the party being examined to answer the questions and to produce the documents comprehended by Questions 37, 77, 78, 414, 415, 411, 234, 237, 247 and 132. The grounds urged in support of the appeal are set out in the notice of motion, and read as follows:\n\"(a) The defendant infringed Canadian Patent No. 1,140,106 ('pull-back patent') in laying a pipe under the St. Lawrence River in 1983, and the parties are now engaged in a reference as to the profits made by the defendant.\n\"(b) The above questions relate to:\n(i) jobs other than the St. Lawrence River crossing; and\n(ii) the time period from 1980 to 1988.\n\"(c) The Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law in determining that answers to the above questions were relevant and in requiring the defendant to answer the above questions.\"",
    "[2]\nThe matter arises from actions brought by the plaintiffs for infringement of two patents relating to the installation of a gas pipe line under the St. Lawrence River near Trois Rivieres, Quebec, in the summer of 1983. On March 20, 1986, the court ruled that the plaintiffs' follow liner patent was invalid, but held in the other action that the defendant was liable for infringement of the plaintiffs' pull-back patent and indicated that there would be further directions as to the procedure on the reference as to damages or an accounting of profits as requested by counsel for the plaintiffs. The action against Baker Marine Corporation and Gaz Inter-Cité Quebec was dismissed with costs. On November 20, 1987, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal and cross-appeal with costs. On June 2, 1986, the Associate Senior Prothonotary ordered the defendant, Baker Energy Resources Corporation, [Berco], to make available for inspection and the taking of copies the following documents:\n\"All documents and records relating to the crossing of the St. Lawrence River near Trois Rivieres including forecasts of expenses and profits, bills of material, actual expenses incurred, all correspondence relating to this project, all books of account, accounting records and all management reports; and all financial statements, audited or otherwise, of the defendant, Baker Energy Resources Corporation, from 1980 to date.\"\nThe prothonotary also ordered that an officer of the defendant be presented for examination on discovery. On April 22, 1987, Billy Jack Greer was examined at Toronto, Ontario, on behalf of the defendant. On August 4, 1988, the plaintiffs brought a motion seeking an order that the defendant comply with the prothonotary's order of June 2, 1986 and answer certain questions objected to and provided written answers to undertakings given at the time. The prothonotary made an order on the same date requiring the defendant to provide answers in writing to all outstanding undertakings, and adjourned the matter over to September 8, 1988. The prothonotary made an order on that date requiring the defendant to provide answers in writing to certain questions put to its officer at the discovery on April 22, 1987. The defendant now appeals that part of the order relating to the questions set out in its notice of motion.",
    "[3]\nThe present case raises two issues for determination, namely: (1) the recurring question of the principles applicable to prothonotary appeals; and (2) whether the propriety of the questions put on discovery is determinable on the basis of their relevance to the issues defined by the reference.",
    "[4]\nRule 336(5) of the Federal Court Rules provides for appeals from an order or decision of a prothonotary, and it is unnecessary to set it out verbatim. Suffice it to say, the rule has been the subject of some judicial consideration.",
    "[5]\nIn my view, the law was correctly stated by Mr. Justice Collier in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 261-262 as follows:\n\"... an appeal from the decision of a Prothonotary is not a trial de novo\n. . . . .\n\"It is not the function of the Trial Division, sitting on appeal from Prothonotaries, to substitute its discretion for that of the Prothonotary. It must be shown the Prothonotary was wrong, in that he exercised his powers on a wrong principle, or on a complete misapprehension on the facts, or for some other compelling reason requiring interference by a judge sitting in an appellate position.\"",
    "[6]\nAmple support for this principle may be found in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.I.P.R. 40 (F.C.A.), wherein the court held that the order under appeal, being discretionary, should be overruled only if the motions judge was clearly wrong on the facts, or proceeded on an erroneous principle of law, or his decision resulted in some injustice to the appellant. None of these circumstances were existent in the case on appeal. It seems to me that it is now authoritatively settled as a rule of practice that an appeal from a discretionary order, whether it be that of a prothonotary or a motions judge, should be treated as an appeal rather than a rehearing on the merits, and the order appealed from should be interfered with only when it can be demonstrated that such order was clearly wrong in law or on the facts. For a useful review of the comparable principle applicable to appeals from interlocutory orders of masters, see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.).",
    "[7]\nThe purpose of discovery, whether oral or by production of documents, is to obtain admissions to facilitate proof of the matters in issue between the parties. The prevailing trend today favours broadening the avenues of fair and full disclosure to enable the party to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary. Discovery can serve to bring the issues more clearly into focus, thus avoiding unnecessary proof and additional costs at trial. Discovery can also provide a very useful tool for purposes of cross-examination.",
    "[8]\nThe broadening scope of discovery is reflected in rule 465(15) which reads:\n\"465(15) Upon examination for discovery otherwise than under paragraph (5), the individual being questioned shall answer any question as to any fact within the knowledge or means of knowledge of the party being examined for discovery that may prove or tend to prove or disprove or tend to disprove any unadmitted allegation of fact in any pleading filed by the party being examined for discovery or the examining party.\"",
    "[9]\nFox, Canadian Patent Law and Practice (4th Ed.), makes the following accurate statement regarding production of documents at p. 456:\n\"Production should be made of all documents that directly or indirectly enable the party seeking production to better his own case or destroy that of his adversary, or may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry that may have either of these consequences, or if generally the documents are such as to throw light on the case. In patent cases the court is more than ordinarily cautious in ordering the production of documents beyond what is necessary to prove a party's case. Documents dated after the inception of the action will not be required to be produced.\"",
    "[10]\nThe case authorities afford some useful guidelines bearing on the issue of relevance vis-à-vis the determination of whether the learned prothonotary was clearly wrong in compelling answers to the questions enumerated in the defendant's notice of motion. I will endeavour to review briefly the ones I consider to be most applicable.\n1. The test as to what documents are required to be produced is simply relevance. The test of relevance is not a matter for the exercise of the discretion. What documents parties are entitled to is a matter of law, not a matter of discretion. The principle for determining what document properly relates to the matters in issue is that it must be one which might reasonably be supposed to contain information which may directly or indirectly enable the party requiring production to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary, or which might fairly lead him to a train of inquiry that could have either of these consequences:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).\n2. On an examination for discovery prior to the commencement of a reference that has been directed, the party being examined need only answer questions directed to the actual issues raised by the reference. Conversely, questions relating to information which has already been produced and questions which are too general or ask for an opinion or are outside the scope of the reference need not be answered by a witness:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.); affd. (1984), 1 C.P. R.(3d) 242 (F.C.T.D.).\n3. The propriety of any question on discovery must be determined on the basis of its relevance to the facts pleaded in the statement of claim as constituting the cause of action rather than on its relevance to facts which the plaintiff proposes to prove to establish the facts constituting the cause of action. Additionally, where a reference has been directed, the application of rule 465(15) requires that the answers on discovery be restricted to questions as to facts that may prove or tend to prove or disprove or tend to disprove any unadmitted allegation of fact placed in issue on the reference:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 5 (F.C.A.).\n4. The court should not compel answers to questions which, although they might be considered relevant, are not at all likely to advance in any way the questioning party's legal position:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 108.\n5. Before compelling an answer to any question on an examination for discovery, the court must weigh the probability of the usefulness of the answer to the party seeking the information, with the time, trouble, expense and difficulty involved in obtaining it. Where on the one hand both the probative value and the usefulness of the answer to the examining party would appear to be, at the most, minimal and where, on the other hand, obtaining the answer would involve great difficultly and a considerable expenditure of time and effort to the party being examined, the court should not compel an answer. One must look at what is reasonable and fair under the circum-stances:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  unadmitted allegations of fact in the pleadings, and fishing expeditions by way of a vague, far-reaching or an irrelevant line of questioning are to be discouraged:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).",
    "[11]\nThe following are the questions in issue, as enumerated in the defendant's notice of motion, viz:\nQuestion No.\nDiscovery Page\nQuestion\n37\n8\nIs Berco still using the method it used on the crossing of the St. Lawrence River in any of its operations including those outside Canada?\n77\n18\nProvide a listing of all the jobs performed by Berco since its inception.\n78\n18\nProvide a listing of all the jobs performed by Berco worldwide, as they relate to Berco's income and profits, for the period 1982 to 1984.\n414\n140\nProvide the breakdown of revenue from the contract which is the subject of this action for the year ended December 31, 1983 and second, other contracts and, third, revenue not related to contracts specifying the nature of that revenue.\n415\n140\nWith respect to costs of the contracts for the year ended December 31, 1983, provide costs breakdown for the contract at issue and for other contracts. In addition, provide an analysis of the costs by type of expense, that is wages, supplies, subcontracts and other types of expenses on the Gaz job and on other contracts.\n411\n136\nAdvise if Berco was involved with any other companies in 1983 that carried on business activities relating to directionally controlled horizontal drilling.\n234\n63\nProduce all monthly financial statements beginning in 1980 and up to the present.\n237\n65\nProduce the monthly financial statements from mid-1984 to present, the period of Mr. Greer's employment with Berco.\n247\n69\nProduce an unauditied financial statement for the period ending December 31, 1986 and monthly financial statements for 1987 to date.\n132\n35\nProduce any promotional brochures or literature of Berco of any sort produced by Berco since 1983.",
    "[12]\nThe principal objection taken by defendant's counsel is that the questions, or at least substantial portions of the same, are irrelevant to the issues raised by the reference. Mr. Anissimoff argues that these issues must necessarily be confined to taking an account of the actual profits made by the defendant on the St. Lawrence River crossing project, and resulting from the patent infringement. He contends strenuously that the appropriate avenue of inquiry open to the plaintiffs on the reference is simply to elicit information as to the defendant's direct and indirect costs in employing the infringing method on the so-called Gaz job, and that anything going beyond these specific terms of reference is irrelevant and in the nature of a fishing expedition.",
    "[13]\nPlaintiffs' counsel emphasizes the point that what is under appeal is the prothonotary's order of September 8, 1988, relating to the subject questions and he presses the argument that this discretionary order should not be reversed unless it can be demonstrated by the defendant that the prothonotary was clearly wrong. As to the questions themselves, he contends that the plaintiffs are entitled to all information pertaining to any expenses which might be offset against the profits earned from the Gaz job for which the defendant is liable to account. Mr. Lane acknowledges that what falls to be determined by the reference is an account of the profits made by the defendant on the Gaz project by reason of its infringement of the plaintiffs' pull-back patent. Nonetheless, he urges that it becomes very important for the plaintiffs to know whether this pull-back method was employed by Berco in other like jobs throughout the world.",
    "[14]\nThe case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), relied on by plaintiff's counsel, was an appeal from a report of the prothonotary relating to an accounting of profits in a patent infringement action. The case provides an extensive review of the authorities and distinguishes the principles governing an award of damages in a patent infringement action from those pertaining to the equitable remedy of an accounting for profits derived from the act of infringement. The plaintiff adduced expert accounting evidence for determining the nature of \"net profits\", which the prothonotary accepted. The court held, inter alia, that his decision to apply the differential accounting or direct costing method of accounting was correct under the circumstances.",
    "[15]\nMr. Justice Addy stated the principle on this aspect of the case at p. 213:\n\"... the infringer is entitled to deduct only those expenses, both variable and fixed, which actually contributed to the sums received and for which he is liable to account. It follows that no part or proportion of any expenditure which would have been incurred had the infringing operation not taken place, is to be considered as deductible.\"",
    "[16]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a patent infringement action alluded to by Addy, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the successful plaintiff elected to take an account of profits and the issue went to the proper form of order to be made, which Pennycuick, J., answered at p. 60 as follows:\n\"... what the plaintiff who elects in favour of an account of profits is entitled to, is simply an account of profits in the sense which I have indicated, that is, what has the plaintiff [sic] expended upon manufacturing these goods? What is the price which he has received on their sale? and the difference is profit. That is what the plaintiffs claim in the order for an account as formulated by them; that is simply an account of the profits made by the defendants in the manufacture and sale of the brassieres U.15 and U.25.\"",
    "[17]\nClearly, the questions must be judged by the legal test of their relevancy to the profits earned by the defendant from the patent infringement. In fairness to the learned prothonotary, it must be pointed out that he lacked the benefit of any expert accounting evidence which might have afforded some useful guidance in the determination of these profits, unlike the Teledyne case.",
    "[18]\nThe main thrust of Questions 37, 77 and 78 is directed to other operations and other jobs performed by the defendant, Berco, regardless of any qualifying words of limitation. In the case of Carnation Foods Co., supra, the Court of Appeal was unanimous in its view that the motions judge erred in law in ordering to be answered questions relating to a possible corporate connection between the patent infringer and the U.S. company or any other corporations on the ground that such corporations were not parties to the proceedings and the questions were irrelevant to the unadmitted allegations of fact as pleaded.",
    "[19]\nIn my opinion, the learned prothonotary erred in law in ruling that these questions were relevant to the determination of the profits made by the defendant on the St. Lawrence River crossing project and attributable to the patent infringement. I fail to see how they would be likely to throw any light on that topic. The questions are therefore disallowed.",
    "[20]\nIn my view, Question 411 falls within the same category as the preceding questions. I find that the prothonotary erred in permitting this question inasmuch as it is irrelevant to the issues raised by the reference. Consequently, the question is disallowed.",
    "[21]\nIt seems to me that the same result must obtain with respect to Question 132, namely, error in law. I fail to see what useful, probative value these documents could have in a reference for an accounting of profits resulting from the particular infringement complained of. The question is disallowed.",
    "[22]\nQuestions 414 and 415 are something of a mixed bag from the stand-point of their relevancy.",
    "[23]\nDefendant's counsel submits that the second and third parts of Question 414 relating to other contracts and other revenue apart from contracts are totally irrelevant to the issue of the profits earned from the patent infringement. Plaintiffs' counsel asserts that these additional portions of the question are relevant to the reference issue, but fails to explain why. As indicated, the learned prothonotary did not have the benefit of any expert accounting evidence that would tend to support the plaintiff's position. In my view, he erred in law in allowing the second and third parts of this question relating to revenue breakdowns for other contracts and all sources of revenue generally by reason that these are much too general and far-reaching in terms of the scope of the reference. The first part of the question down to and including the words \"the year ended December 31, 1983\" is clearly relevant to the issue raised by the reference, and is allowable accordingly. The remainder of the question appearing thereafter must be disallowed on the ground of error as being irrelevant to and outside the scope of the reference.",
    "[24]\nApplying the same reasoning to Question 415, I consider that the prothonotary erred in law in requiring the defendant to provide cost breakdowns and analyses of expenses for other contracts, apart from the Gaz job. The additional portions comprehended by the words \"and for other contracts\" in the fourth line of the question and the words \"and on other contracts\" appearing at the end thereof are disallowed as being irrelevant to and outside the scope of the reference. The remainder of the question is allowed.",
    "[25]\nQuestions 234, 237 and 247 come within the category of questions directed to obtaining financial information which might somehow assist the questioner in advancing his own case or aid in damaging the case of his adversary, or which might fairly lead to a train of inquiry that could have either of these consequences.",
    "[26]\nDefendant's counsel objects to the production of all monthly financial statements, whether limited to a particular time frame or otherwise, on the ground that these do not come within the category of documents and records relating to the St. Lawrence River crossing as envisaged by the order of June 2, 1986, and that the request for their production is nothing more than a blatant attempt to embark on an aimless fishing expedition. Plaintiffs' counsel rejoins by quoting the concluding portion of the said order in reference to all financial statements of the defendant generally from 1980 to date. Incidentally, this concluding portion is separated from what precedes it by a semicolon but, in my view, the punctuation mark is not particularly determinative. What is more significant, in my view, is the absence of any explanation as to how or why these monthly financial statements could fairly lead to a train of inquiry which might have some useful probative value in terms of relevancy.",
    "[27]\nCounsel referred repeatedly to the issues raised by the reference, but I can find no evidence of anything which would define and identify those issues beyond the plaintiffs' election for an accounting of profits from the patent infringement and the order of June 2, 1986, particularizing the documents to be produced by the defendant. The bottom line position of counsel for the defendant is simply that the monthly financial statements of Berco from 1980 up to the present time go far beyond the ambit of documents and records relating to the Gaz job, and are thus irrelevant and outside the scope of the reference.",
    "[28]\nViewing Questions 234, 237 and 247 collectively, the test to be applied, as it seems to me, is whether they can be fairly seen as pointing to a productive train of inquiry which might directly or indirectly advance the plaintiffs' case or damage the defendant's case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), approved the train of inquiry principle as the correct test of relevancy for purposes of discovery, and ordered the production of the whole file from which a particular letter had been produced.",
    "[29]\nIn my view, it can hardly be said that the production of existent monthly financial statements is totally irrelevant to an accounting for the profits earned by the defendant from its infringement of the plaintiffs' patent. Conceivably, these could illustrate some cost expenditure or proportionate part thereof which is not so connected with the infringing activity as to be properly deductible. The difficulty here is compounded by the fact that the references to monthly financial statements are somewhat duplicitous and overlapping and there is no clear definition of what is meant by the words \"the present\". But for that, I am not prepared to go so far as to rule that the prothonotary clearly erred in ordering the production of existing monthly financial statements from the standpoint of their relevancy to an accounting for profits. With respect, I consider that he did err in allowing Question 237 by reason that it is totally redundant when taken in context with Question 234. Question 237 is disallowed accordingly.",
    "[30]\nAs to Question 247 I am of the opinion that the learned prothonotary erred in requiring production of monthly financial statements from January 1, 1987, to date. This area of inquiry represents, in my view, nothing more than a fishing expedition that would have little probative value in view of the extended time frame. There is also the factor of the burdensome inconvenience involved. I rule, therefore, that Question 247 is allowable as to the portion concluding with the words \"ending December 31, 1986\" with the remainder being deleted therefrom.",
    "[31]\nComing back to Question 234, I am of the opinion that there is no patent error on the broad issue of its relevancy to the accounting for profits, provided the question is put in the following modified form:\n\"\nQuestion 234\n: Produce all existent monthly financial statements beginning in 1980 and up to and including December 31, 1986.\"",
    "[32]\nIn the result, the defendant's appeal is allowed, save only for Question 234 in the foregoing modified form. To that extent, the plaintiffs achieved a limited degree of success so there will be no order as to costs. An order will go accordingly.\nAppeal allowed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk\n[End of document]"

  "full_text": "[1]\nMcNair, J.\n: This is an appeal by the defendant, Baker Energy Resources Corporation, from an order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary made on September 8, 1988, compelling answers to certain questions put to the defendant's officer on his examination for discovery held on April 22, 1987. The appeal is from that part of the prothonotary's order which ordered the party being examined to answer the questions and to produce the documents comprehended by Questions 37, 77, 78, 414, 415, 411, 234, 237, 247 and 132.

The propriety of any question on discovery must be determined on the basis of its relevance to the facts pleaded in the statement of claim as constituting the cause of action rather than on its relevance to facts which the plaintiff proposes to prove to establish the facts constituting the cause of action. Additionally, where a reference has been directed, the application of rule 465(15) requires that the answers on discovery be restricted to questions as to facts that may prove or tend to prove or disprove or tend to disprove any unadmitted allegation of fact placed in issue on the reference:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 5 (F.C.A.).\n4. The court should not compel answers to questions which, although they might be considered relevant, are not at all likely to advance in any way the questioning party's legal position:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 108.\n5. Before compelling an answer to any question on an examination for discovery, the court must weigh the probability of the usefulness of the answer to the party seeking the information, with the time, trouble, expense and difficulty involved in obtaining it. Where on the one hand both the probative value and the usefulness of the answer to the examining party would appear to be, at the most, minimal and where, on the other hand, obtaining the answer would involve great difficultly and a considerable expenditure of time and effort to the party being examined, the court should not compel an answer. One must look at what is reasonable and fair under the circum-stances:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  unadmitted allegations of fact in the pleadings, and fishing expeditions by way of a vague, far-reaching or an irrelevant line of questioning are to be discouraged:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).\n[11]\nThe following are the questions in issue, as enumerated in the defendant's notice of motion, viz:\nQuestion No.\nDiscovery Page\nQuestion\n37\n8\nIs Berco still using the method it used on the crossing of the St. Lawrence River in any of its operations including those outside Canada?\n77\n18\nProvide a listing of all the jobs performed by Berco since its inception.\n78\n18\nProvide a listing of all the jobs performed by Berco worldwide, as they relate to Berco's income and profits, for the period 1982 to 1984.\n414\n140\nProvide the breakdown of revenue from the contract which is the subject of this action for the year ended December 31, 1983 and second, other contracts and, third, revenue not related to contracts specifying the nature of that revenue.\n415\n140\nWith respect to costs of the contracts for the year ended December 31, 1983, provide costs breakdown for the contract at issue and for other contracts. In addition, provide an analysis of the costs by type of expense, that is wages, supplies, subcontracts and other types of expenses on the Gaz job and on other contracts.\n411\n136\nAdvise if Berco was involved with any other companies in 1983 that carried on business activities relating to directionally controlled horizontal drilling.\n234\n63\nProduce all monthly financial statements beginning in 1980 and up to the present.\n237\n65\nProduce the monthly financial statements from mid-1984 to present, the period of Mr. Greer's employment with Berco.\n247\n69\nProduce an unauditied financial statement for the period ending December 31, 1986 and monthly financial statements for 1987 to date.\n132\n35\nProduce any promotional brochures or literature of Berco of any sort produced by Berco since 1983.\n[12]\nThe principal objection taken by defendant's counsel is that the questions, or at least substantial portions of the same, are irrelevant to the issues raised by the reference. Mr. Anissimoff argues that these issues must necessarily be confined to taking an account of the actual profits made by the defendant on the St. Lawrence River crossing project, and resulting from the patent infringement. He contends strenuously that the appropriate avenue of inquiry open to the plaintiffs on the reference is simply to elicit information as to the defendant's direct and indirect costs in employing the infringing method on the so-called Gaz job, and that anything going beyond these specific terms of reference is irrelevant and in the nature of a fishing expedition.\n[13]\nPlaintiffs' counsel emphasizes the point that what is under appeal is the prothonotary's order of September 8, 1988, relating to the subject questions and he presses the argument that this discretionary order should not be reversed unless it can be demonstrated by the defendant that the prothonotary was clearly wrong. As to the questions themselves, he contends that the plaintiffs are entitled to all information pertaining to any expenses which might be offset against the profits earned from the Gaz job for which the defendant is liable to account. Mr. Lane acknowledges that what falls to be determined by the reference is an account of the profits made by the defendant on the Gaz project by reason of its infringement of the plaintiffs' pull-back patent. Nonetheless, he urges that it becomes very important for the plaintiffs to know whether this pull-back method was employed by Berco in other like jobs throughout the world.\n[14]\nThe case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), relied on by plaintiff's counsel, was an appeal from a report of the prothonotary relating to an accounting of profits in a patent infringement action. The case provides an extensive review of the authorities and distinguishes the principles governing an award of damages in a patent infringement action from those pertaining to the equitable remedy of an accounting for profits derived from the act of infringement. The plaintiff adduced expert accounting evidence for determining the nature of \"net profits\", which the prothonotary accepted. The court held, inter alia, that his decision to apply the differential accounting or direct costing method of accounting was correct under the circumstances.\n[15]\nMr. Justice Addy stated the principle on this aspect of the case at p. 213:\n\"... the infringer is entitled to deduct only those expenses, both variable and fixed, which actually contributed to the sums received and for which he is liable to account. It follows that no part or proportion of any expenditure which would have been incurred had the infringing operation not taken place, is to be considered as deductible.\"\n[16]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a patent infringement action alluded to by Addy, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the successful plaintiff elected to take an account of profits and the issue went to the proper form of order to be made, which Pennycuick, J., answered at p. 60 as follows:\n\"... what the plaintiff who elects in favour of an account of profits is entitled to, is simply an account of profits in the sense which I have indicated, that is, what has the plaintiff [sic] expended upon manufacturing these goods? What is the price which he has received on their sale? and the difference is profit. That is what the plaintiffs claim in the order for an account as formulated by them; that is simply an account of the profits made by the defendants in the manufacture and sale of the brassieres U.15 and U.25.\"\n[17]\nClearly, the questions must be judged by the legal test of their relevancy to the profits earned by the defendant from the patent infringement. In fairness to the learned prothonotary, it must be pointed out that he lacked the benefit of any expert accounting evidence which might have afforded some useful guidance in the determination of these profits, unlike the Teledyne case.\n[18]\nThe main thrust of Questions 37, 77 and 78 is directed to other operations and other jobs performed by the defendant, Berco, regardless of any qualifying words of limitation. In the case of Carnation Foods Co., supra, the Court of Appeal was unanimous in its view that the motions judge erred in law in ordering to be answered questions relating to a possible corporate connection between the patent infringer and the U.S. company or any other corporations on the ground that such corporations were not parties to the proceedings and the questions were irrelevant to the unadmitted allegations of fact as pleaded.\n[19]\nIn my opinion, the learned prothonotary erred in law in ruling that these questions were relevant to the determination of the profits made by the defendant on the St. Lawrence River crossing project and attributable to the patent infringement. I fail to see how they would be likely to throw any light on that topic. The questions are therefore disallowed.\n[20]\nIn my view, Question 411 falls within the same category as the preceding questions. I find that the prothonotary erred in permitting this question inasmuch as it is irrelevant to the issues raised by the reference. Consequently, the question is disallowed.\n[21]\nIt seems to me that the same result must obtain with respect to Question 132, namely, error in law. I fail to see what useful, probative value these documents could have in a reference for an accounting of profits resulting from the particular infringement complained of. The question is disallowed.\n[22]\nQuestions 414 and 415 are something of a mixed bag from the stand-point of their relevancy.\n[23]\nDefendant's counsel submits that the second and third parts of Question 414 relating to other contracts and other revenue apart from contracts are totally irrelevant to the issue of the profits earned from the patent infringement. Plaintiffs' counsel asserts that these additional portions of the question are relevant to the reference issue, but fails to explain why. As indicated, the learned prothonotary did not have the benefit of any expert accounting evidence that would tend to support the plaintiff's position. In my view, he erred in law in allowing the second and third parts of this question relating to revenue breakdowns for other contracts and all sources of revenue generally by reason that these are much too general and far-reaching in terms of the scope of the reference. The first part of the question down to and including the words \"the year ended December 31, 1983\" is clearly relevant to the issue raised by the reference, and is allowable accordingly. The remainder of the question appearing thereafter must be disallowed on the ground of error as being irrelevant to and outside the scope of the reference.\n[24]\nApplying the same reasoning to Question 415, I consider that the prothonotary erred in law in requiring the defendant to provide cost breakdowns and analyses of expenses for other contracts, apart from the Gaz job. The additional portions comprehended by the words \"and for other contracts\" in the fourth line of the question and the words \"and on other contracts\" appearing at the end thereof are disallowed as being irrelevant to and outside the scope of the reference. The remainder of the question is allowed.\n[25]\nQuestions 234, 237 and 247 come within the category of questions directed to obtaining financial information which might somehow assist the questioner in advancing his own case or aid in damaging the case of his adversary, or which might fairly lead to a train of inquiry that could have either of these consequences.\n[26]\nDefendant's counsel objects to the production of all monthly financial statements, whether limited to a particular time frame or otherwise, on the ground that these do not come within the category of documents and records relating to the St. Lawrence River crossing as envisaged by the order of June 2, 1986, and that the request for their production is nothing more than a blatant attempt to embark on an aimless fishing expedition. Plaintiffs' counsel rejoins by quoting the concluding portion of the said order in reference to all financial statements of the defendant generally from 1980 to date. Incidentally, this concluding portion is separated from what precedes it by a semicolon but, in my view, the punctuation mark is not particularly determinative. What is more significant, in my view, is the absence of any explanation as to how or why these monthly financial statements could fairly lead to a train of inquiry which might have some useful probative value in terms of relevancy.\n[27]\nCounsel referred repeatedly to the issues raised by the reference, but I can find no evidence of anything which would define and identify those issues beyond the plaintiffs' election for an accounting of profits from the patent infringement and the order of June 2, 1986, particularizing the documents to be produced by the defendant. The bottom line position of counsel for the defendant is simply that the monthly financial statements of Berco from 1980 up to the present time go far beyond the ambit of documents and records relating to the Gaz job, and are thus irrelevant and outside the scope of the reference.\n[28]\nViewing Questions 234, 237 and 247 collectively, the test to be applied, as it seems to me, is whether they can be fairly seen as pointing to a productive train of inquiry which might directly or indirectly advance the plaintiffs' case or damage the defendant's case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), approved the train of inquiry principle as the correct test of relevancy for purposes of discovery, and ordered the production of the whole file from which a particular letter had been produced.\n[29]\nIn my view, it can hardly be said that the production of existent monthly financial statements is totally irrelevant to an accounting for the profits earned by the defendant from its infringement of the plaintiffs' patent. Conceivably, these could illustrate some cost expenditure or proportionate part thereof which is not so connected with the infringing activity as to be properly deductible. The difficulty here is compounded by the fact that the references to monthly financial statements are somewhat duplicitous and overlapping and there is no clear definition of what is meant by the words \"the present\". But for that, I am not prepared to go so far as to rule that the prothonotary clearly erred in ordering the production of existing monthly financial statements from the standpoint of their relevancy to an accounting for profits. With respect, I consider that he did err in allowing Question 237 by reason that it is totally redundant when taken in context with Question 234. Question 237 is disallowed accordingly.\n[30]\nAs to Question 247 I am of the opinion that the learned prothonotary erred in requiring production of monthly financial statements from January 1, 1987, to date. This area of inquiry represents, in my view, nothing more than a fishing expedition that would have little probative value in view of the extended time frame. There is also the factor of the burdensome inconvenience involved. I rule, therefore, that Question 247 is allowable as to the portion concluding with the words \"ending December 31, 1986\" with the remainder being deleted therefrom.\n[31]\nComing back to Question 234, I am of the opinion that there is no patent error on the broad issue of its relevancy to the accounting for profits, provided the question is put in the following modified form:\n\"\nQuestion 234\n: Produce all existent monthly financial statements beginning in 1980 and up to and including December 31, 1986.\"\n[32]\nIn the result, the defendant's appeal is allowed, save only for Question 234 in the foregoing modified form. To that extent, the plaintiffs achieved a limited degree of success so there will be no order as to costs. An order will go accordingly.\nAppeal allowed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nMcNair, J.\n: This is an appeal by the defendant, Baker Energy Resources Corporation, from an order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary made on September 8, 1988, compelling answers to certain questions put to the defendant's officer on his examination for discovery held on April 22, 1987. The appeal is from that part of the prothonotary's order which ordered the party being examined to answer the questions and to produce the documents comprehended by Questions 37, 77, 78, 414, 415, 411, 234, 237, 247 and 132. The grounds urged in support of the appeal are set out in the notice of motion, and read as follows:\n\"(a) The defendant infringed Canadian Patent No. 1,140,106 ('pull-back patent') in laying a pipe under the St. Lawrence River in 1983, and the parties are now engaged in a reference as to the profits made by the defendant.\n\"(b) The above questions relate to:\n(i) jobs other than the St. Lawrence River crossing; and\n(ii) the time period from 1980 to 1988.\n\"(c) The Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law in determining that answers to the above questions were relevant and in requiring the defendant to answer the above questions.\"\n\n[2]\nThe matter arises from actions brought by the plaintiffs for infringement of two patents relating to the installation of a gas pipe line under the St. Lawrence River near Trois Rivieres, Quebec, in the summer of 1983. On March 20, 1986, the court ruled that the plaintiffs' follow liner patent was invalid, but held in the other action that the defendant was liable for infringement of the plaintiffs' pull-back patent and indicated that there would be further directions as to the procedure on the reference as to damages or an accounting of profits as requested by counsel for the plaintiffs. The action against Baker Marine Corporation and Gaz Inter-Cité Quebec was dismissed with costs. On November 20, 1987, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal and cross-appeal with costs. On June 2, 1986, the Associate Senior Prothonotary ordered the defendant, Baker Energy Resources Corporation, [Berco], to make available for inspection and the taking of copies the following documents:\n\"All documents and records relating to the crossing of the St. Lawrence River near Trois Rivieres including forecasts of expenses and profits, bills of material, actual expenses incurred, all correspondence relating to this project, all books of account, accounting records and all management reports; and all financial statements, audited or otherwise, of the defendant, Baker Energy Resources Corporation, from 1980 to date.\"\nThe prothonotary also ordered that an officer of the defendant be presented for examination on discovery. On April 22, 1987, Billy Jack Greer was examined at Toronto, Ontario, on behalf of the defendant. On August 4, 1988, the plaintiffs brought a motion seeking an order that the defendant comply with the prothonotary's order of June 2, 1986 and answer certain questions objected to and provided written answers to undertakings given at the time. The prothonotary made an order on the same date requiring the defendant to provide answers in writing to all outstanding undertakings, and adjourned the matter over to September 8, 1988. The prothonotary made an order on that date requiring the defendant to provide answers in writing to certain questions put to its officer at the discovery on April 22, 1987. The defendant now appeals that part of the order relating to the questions set out in its notice of motion.\n\n[3]\nThe present case raises two issues for determination, namely: (1) the recurring question of the principles applicable to prothonotary appeals; and (2) whether the propriety of the questions put on discovery is determinable on the basis of their relevance to the issues defined by the reference.\n\n[4]\nRule 336(5) of the Federal Court Rules provides for appeals from an order or decision of a prothonotary, and it is unnecessary to set it out verbatim. Suffice it to say, the rule has been the subject of some judicial consideration.\n\n[5]\nIn my view, the law was correctly stated by Mr. Justice Collier in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 261-262 as follows:\n\"... an appeal from the decision of a Prothonotary is not a trial de novo\n. . . . .\n\"It is not the function of the Trial Division, sitting on appeal from Prothonotaries, to substitute its discretion for that of the Prothonotary. It must be shown the Prothonotary was wrong, in that he exercised his powers on a wrong principle, or on a complete misapprehension on the facts, or for some other compelling reason requiring interference by a judge sitting in an appellate position.\"\n\n[6]\nAmple support for this principle may be found in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.I.P.R. 40 (F.C.A.), wherein the court held that the order under appeal, being discretionary, should be overruled only if the motions judge was clearly wrong on the facts, or proceeded on an erroneous principle of law, or his decision resulted in some injustice to the appellant. None of these circumstances were existent in the case on appeal. It seems to me that it is now authoritatively settled as a rule of practice that an appeal from a discretionary order, whether it be that of a prothonotary or a motions judge, should be treated as an appeal rather than a rehearing on the merits, and the order appealed from should be interfered with only when it can be demonstrated that such order was clearly wrong in law or on the facts. For a useful review of the comparable principle applicable to appeals from interlocutory orders of masters, see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.).\n\n[7]\nThe purpose of discovery, whether oral or by production of documents, is to obtain admissions to facilitate proof of the matters in issue between the parties. The prevailing trend today favours broadening the avenues of fair and full disclosure to enable the party to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary. Discovery can serve to bring the issues more clearly into focus, thus avoiding unnecessary proof and additional costs at trial. Discovery can also provide a very useful tool for purposes of cross-examination.\n\n[8]\nThe broadening scope of discovery is reflected in rule 465(15) which reads:\n\"465(15) Upon examination for discovery otherwise than under paragraph (5), the individual being questioned shall answer any question as to any fact within the knowledge or means of knowledge of the party being examined for discovery that may prove or tend to prove or disprove or tend to disprove any unadmitted allegation of fact in any pleading filed by the party being examined for discovery or the examining party.\"\n\n[9]\nFox, Canadian Patent Law and Practice (4th Ed.), makes the following accurate statement regarding production of documents at p. 456:\n\"Production should be made of all documents that directly or indirectly enable the party seeking production to better his own case or destroy that of his adversary, or may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry that may have either of these consequences, or if generally the documents are such as to throw light on the case. In patent cases the court is more than ordinarily cautious in ordering the production of documents beyond what is necessary to prove a party's case. Documents dated after the inception of the action will not be required to be produced.\"\n\n[10]\nThe case authorities afford some useful guidelines bearing on the issue of relevance vis-à-vis the determination of whether the learned prothonotary was clearly wrong in compelling answers to the questions enumerated in the defendant's notice of motion. I will endeavour to review briefly the ones I consider to be most applicable.\n1. The test as to what documents are required to be produced is simply relevance. The test of relevance is not a matter for the exercise of the discretion. What documents parties are entitled to is a matter of law, not a matter of discretion. The principle for determining what document properly relates to the matters in issue is that it must be one which might reasonably be supposed to contain information which may directly or indirectly enable the party requiring production to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary, or which might fairly lead him to a train of inquiry that could have either of these consequences:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).\n2. On an examination for discovery prior to the commencement of a reference that has been directed, the party being examined need only answer questions directed to the actual issues raised by the reference. Conversely, questions relating to information which has already been produced and questions which are too general or ask for an opinion or are outside the scope of the reference need not be answered by a witness:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.); affd. (1984), 1 C.P. R.(3d) 242 (F.C.T.D.).\n3. The propriety of any question on discovery must be determined on the basis of its relevance to the facts pleaded in the statement of claim as constituting the cause of action rather than on its relevance to facts which the plaintiff proposes to prove to establish the facts constituting the cause of action. Additionally, where a reference has been directed, the application of rule 465(15) requires that the answers on discovery be restricted to questions as to facts that may prove or tend to prove or disprove or tend to disprove any unadmitted allegation of fact placed in issue on the reference:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 5 (F.C.A.).\n4. The court should not compel answers to questions which, although they might be considered relevant, are not at all likely to advance in any way the questioning party's legal position:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 108.\n5. Before compelling an answer to any question on an examination for discovery, the court must weigh the probability of the usefulness of the answer to the party seeking the information, with the time, trouble, expense and difficulty involved in obtaining it. Where on the one hand both the probative value and the usefulness of the answer to the examining party would appear to be, at the most, minimal and where, on the other hand, obtaining the answer would involve great difficultly and a considerable expenditure of time and effort to the party being examined, the court should not compel an answer. One must look at what is reasonable and fair under the circum-stances:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  unadmitted allegations of fact in the pleadings, and fishing expeditions by way of a vague, far-reaching or an irrelevant line of questioning are to be discouraged:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).\n\n[11]\nThe following are the questions in issue, as enumerated in the defendant's notice of motion, viz:\nQuestion No.\nDiscovery Page\nQuestion\n37\n8\nIs Berco still using the method it used on the crossing of the St. Lawrence River in any of its operations including those outside Canada?\n77\n18\nProvide a listing of all the jobs performed by Berco since its inception.\n78\n18\nProvide a listing of all the jobs performed by Berco worldwide, as they relate to Berco's income and profits, for the period 1982 to 1984.\n414\n140\nProvide the breakdown of revenue from the contract which is the subject of this action for the year ended December 31, 1983 and second, other contracts and, third, revenue not related to contracts specifying the nature of that revenue.\n415\n140\nWith respect to costs of the contracts for the year ended December 31, 1983, provide costs breakdown for the contract at issue and for other contracts. In addition, provide an analysis of the costs by type of expense, that is wages, supplies, subcontracts and other types of expenses on the Gaz job and on other contracts.\n411\n136\nAdvise if Berco was involved with any other companies in 1983 that carried on business activities relating to directionally controlled horizontal drilling.\n234\n63\nProduce all monthly financial statements beginning in 1980 and up to the present.\n237\n65\nProduce the monthly financial statements from mid-1984 to present, the period of Mr. Greer's employment with Berco.\n247\n69\nProduce an unauditied financial statement for the period ending December 31, 1986 and monthly financial statements for 1987 to date.\n132\n35\nProduce any promotional brochures or literature of Berco of any sort produced by Berco since 1983.\n\n[12]\nThe principal objection taken by defendant's counsel is that the questions, or at least substantial portions of the same, are irrelevant to the issues raised by the reference. Mr. Anissimoff argues that these issues must necessarily be confined to taking an account of the actual profits made by the defendant on the St. Lawrence River crossing project, and resulting from the patent infringement.

In fairness to the learned prothonotary, it must be pointed out that he lacked the benefit of any expert accounting evidence which might have afforded some useful guidance in the determination of these profits, unlike the Teledyne case.\n\n[18]\nThe main thrust of Questions 37, 77 and 78 is directed to other operations and other jobs performed by the defendant, Berco, regardless of any qualifying words of limitation. In the case of Carnation Foods Co., supra, the Court of Appeal was unanimous in its view that the motions judge erred in law in ordering to be answered questions relating to a possible corporate connection between the patent infringer and the U.S. company or any other corporations on the ground that such corporations were not parties to the proceedings and the questions were irrelevant to the unadmitted allegations of fact as pleaded.\n\n[19]\nIn my opinion, the learned prothonotary erred in law in ruling that these questions were relevant to the determination of the profits made by the defendant on the St. Lawrence River crossing project and attributable to the patent infringement.

I find that the prothonotary erred in permitting this question inasmuch as it is irrelevant to the issues raised by the reference. Consequently, the question is disallowed.\n\n[21]\nIt seems to me that the same result must obtain with respect to Question 132, namely, error in law. I fail to see what useful, probative value these documents could have in a reference for an accounting of profits resulting from the particular infringement complained of. The question is disallowed.\n\n[22]\nQuestions 414 and 415 are something of a mixed bag from the stand-point of their relevancy.\n\n[23]\nDefendant's counsel submits that the second and third parts of Question 414 relating to other contracts and other revenue apart from contracts are totally irrelevant to the issue of the profits earned from the patent infringement.

The additional portions comprehended by the words \"and for other contracts\" in the fourth line of the question and the words \"and on other contracts\" appearing at the end thereof are disallowed as being irrelevant to and outside the scope of the reference. The remainder of the question is allowed.\n\n[25]\nQuestions 234, 237 and 247 come within the category of questions directed to obtaining financial information which might somehow assist the questioner in advancing his own case or aid in damaging the case of his adversary, or which might fairly lead to a train of inquiry that could have either of these consequences.\n\n[26]\nDefendant's counsel objects to the production of all monthly financial statements, whether limited to a particular time frame or otherwise, on the ground that these do not come within the category of documents and records relating to the St. Lawrence River crossing as envisaged by the order of June 2, 1986, and that the request for their production is nothing more than a blatant attempt to embark on an aimless fishing expedition. Plaintiffs' counsel rejoins by quoting the concluding portion of the said order in reference to all financial statements of the defendant generally from 1980 to date. Incidentally, this concluding portion is separated from what precedes it by a semicolon but, in my view, the punctuation mark is not particularly determinative. What is more significant, in my view, is the absence of any explanation as to how or why these monthly financial statements could fairly lead to a train of inquiry which might have some useful probative value in terms of relevancy.\n\n[27]\nCounsel referred repeatedly to the issues raised by the reference, but I can find no evidence of anything which would define and identify those issues beyond the plaintiffs' election for an accounting of profits from the patent infringement and the order of June 2, 1986, particularizing the documents to be produced by the defendant. The bottom line position of counsel for the defendant is simply that the monthly financial statements of Berco from 1980 up to the present time go far beyond the ambit of documents and records relating to the Gaz job, and are thus irrelevant and outside the scope of the reference.\n\n[28]\nViewing Questions 234, 237 and 247 collectively, the test to be applied, as it seems to me, is whether they can be fairly seen as pointing to a productive train of inquiry which might directly or indirectly advance the plaintiffs' case or damage the defendant's case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), approved the train of inquiry principle as the correct test of relevancy for purposes of discovery, and ordered the production of the whole file from which a particular letter had been produced.\n\n[29]\nIn my view, it can hardly be said that the production of existent monthly financial statements is totally irrelevant to an accounting for the profits earned by the defendant from its infringement of the plaintiffs' patent. Conceivably, these could illustrate some cost expenditure or proportionate part thereof which is not so connected with the infringing activity as to be properly deductible. The difficulty here is compounded by the fact that the references to monthly financial statements are somewhat duplicitous and overlapping and there is no clear definition of what is meant by the words \"the present\". But for that, I am not prepared to go so far as to rule that the prothonotary clearly erred in ordering the production of existing monthly financial statements from the standpoint of their relevancy to an accounting for profits. With respect, I consider that he did err in allowing Question 237 by reason that it is totally redundant when taken in context with Question 234. Question 237 is disallowed accordingly.\n\n[30]\nAs to Question 247 I am of the opinion that the learned prothonotary erred in requiring production of monthly financial statements from January 1, 1987, to date. This area of inquiry represents, in my view, nothing more than a fishing expedition that would have little probative value in view of the extended time frame. There is also the factor of the burdensome inconvenience involved. I rule, therefore, that Question 247 is allowable as to the portion concluding with the words \"ending December 31, 1986\" with the remainder being deleted therefrom.\n\n[31]\nComing back to Question 234, I am of the opinion that there is no patent error on the broad issue of its relevancy to the accounting for profits, provided the question is put in the following modified form:\n\"\nQuestion 234\n: Produce all existent monthly financial statements beginning in 1980 and up to and including December 31, 1986.\"\n\n[32]\nIn the result, the defendant's appeal is allowed, save only for Question 234 in the foregoing modified form. To that extent, the plaintiffs achieved a limited degree of success so there will be no order as to costs. An order will go accordingly.\nAppeal allowed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk\n[End of document]",

      "The court found questions relating to operations *other than* the St. Lawrence River crossing (Questions 37, 77, 78, 411, and portions of 414 & 415) were irrelevant because they did not directly relate to the profits earned from the infringing activity and were thus disallowed, citing *Carnation Foods Co.* as precedent.",
      "The court disallowed Question 132 (promotional brochures) as lacking probative value regarding the accounting of profits.",
      "The court partially allowed Questions 414 and 415, permitting the portion relating to the year 1983 but disallowing the broader requests for information on other contracts and revenue sources, finding them too general and outside the scope of the reference.",

Question 237 was disallowed as redundant, and Question 247 was limited to statements ending December 31, 1986, to avoid a fishing expedition.",
