Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n Summary: \n \n This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[1] \n   \n Near, J. \n : This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated May 20, 2011. The Board determined that the Applicant, Selvaratnam Veerasingam, was not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the  \n Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \n , SC 2001, c 27.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[2] \n  For the reasons set out below, this application is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n I.  \n Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[3] \n  The Applicant is a Tamil citizen of Sri Lanka. He brought a refugee claim in Canada based on a fear of the Sri Lankan army and Tamil militant groups. He alleged having been detained on many occasions between 1980 and 2009.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[4] \n  More specifically, he claimed that Sri Lankan soldiers detained him for one and a half months in October 2008 until he was released as a result of a friend paying a bribe. He also alleged that he was told to leave the country as the soldiers reported that he had escaped.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[5] \n  He left Sri Lanka in April 2009 and traveled through Malaysia, Africa and Europe (notably Switzerland) before arriving in Canada in May of the same year. He was 59 years old at the time of his refugee hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n II.  \n Decision Under Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[6] \n  The Board found that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee due in part to a lack of credible testimony and failure to provide proof corroborating the alleged incidents.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[7] \n  Commenting on the credibility of the Applicant's testimony, the decision states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n The Tribunal found the claimant's testimony throughout the hearing to be protracted and evasive. It was extremely difficult to extract information. He was asked but never made it clear how, when and/or how many times exactly he was arrested or detained, over the thirty year time frame. Nor did he credibly convey that he was in fear for his life, nor why it was that he allegedly feared all of those years, yet only chose to leave Sri Lanka at the age of 59.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n The claimant would frequently answer questions that were not what was being asked. The Tribunal checked at the outset and the claimant confirmed that he fully understood the interpreter. During the hearing the Tribunal reconfirmed with the claimant and the interpreter to ensure that there were no communication issues.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[8] \n  The Board found that the Applicant had failed to credibly demonstrate that anyone from a militant group was after him or that he had suffered injuries. Surprise documents produced in the middle of the hearing were found to be of questionable probative value.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[9] \n  The Applicant was also faulted for the delay in leaving Sri Lanka and making a refugee claim. It was noted that despite claims he was \"in fear for his life for many years and alleged detention, he indicated that following payment of a bribe to secure his release in December 2008, he was told to simply leave the country\" but had provided \"no explanation as to why. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[10] \n  Given his lack of credibility and change in circumstances in Sri Lanka, the Board did not believe he was persecuted. It also concluded that no one was looking for him. He had not established that it was not more likely than not that he was at risk if returned to his country of origin.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n III.  \n Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[11] \n  The issue raised by the Applicant is whether the Board committed a reviewable error in assessing his claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n IV.  \n Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[12] \n  The Board's findings of fact and credibility are to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness (see  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53 and  \n Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 45.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[13] \n  Applying the reasonableness standard as prescribed by  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47, this Court must be \"concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility with in the decision-making process\" as well as \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[14] \n  By contrast, questions of law demand the correctness standard ( \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 50).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n V.  \n Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[15] \n  While the Applicant acknowledges that the Board's findings are reasonable for the most part, he submits that an error resulted in failing to discuss why he would not be at risk as a returning, failed refugee claimant. He points to evidence submitted and referred to at paragraph 19 of the Board's decision of \"articles submitted by the claimant's counsel regarding the treatment of Tamils in Sri Lanka, specifically returned asylum seekers.\" According to the Applicant, failed refugee claimants who are targeted would be a member of a particular social group and this should have been addressed by the Board.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[16] \n  The Respondent contends that the Board addresses this matter when its reasons are read in context. Given the reference to related material submitted by counsel, it cannot be said that the Board ignored this evidence. In that same paragraph, the Board also concluded that \"[f]urther still, the claimant failed to credibly, convey to the Tribunal, that subsequent to his release, he was, is or would be sought after by anyone for any reason in Sri Lanka.\" This can be seen as a finding on the issue and the Applicant is simply challenging the weighing of the evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[17] \n  The Applicant refers the Court to the decision of  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ no 650 at para 104 where it was acknowledged that \"in general, a negative credibility finding (if reasonable and made with regard to the evidence) will mean that the decision maker does not have to look further into the claim\" but \"if the claimant puts forward facts that raise an additional ground of persecution, that part of the claim still needs to be assessed, unless the visa officer clearly finds that part of the claim to also lack credibility. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[18] \n  The error arose in  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  because the Board never considered the additional ground of persecution. However, I am not convinced that this also occurred in the present case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[19] \n  As the Respondent highlights, the Board stated in its reasons that it considered the Applicant's evidence regarding the treatment of Tamils who were returned asylum seekers in Sri Lanka and based on this evidence the Board found that the Applicant would not be \"sought after by anyone for any reason <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[20] \n  In his reply, the Applicant appears to characterize the issue as one of adequacy of reasons on the risk associated with him returning as a failed refugee claimant. He relies on the decision of  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ no 809 to suggest that the Board did not explain the basis for its decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[21] \n  Referring to the Supreme Court's recent elaboration on the requirement of reasons in  \n Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] SCJ no 62 at para 18, the respondent notes the quoted passage that \"[r]easons are not to be reviewed in a vacuum - the result is to be looked at in the context of the evidence, the parties' submissions and the process.\" Considering that the determinative issue was credibility and a failure to establish a personal risk of harm, it was not unreasonable to consider the evidence of risk to failed asylum seekers and determine that the Applicant would not be sought after by anyone for any reason in Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[22] \n  I am prepared to agree with the Respondent's position. In light of serious credibility concerns, the Board's decision accords with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility. Although the evidence on this issue was dealt with briefly, it was considered.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[23] \n  The Board reasonably weighed that evidence and reached a broader conclusion that the Applicant had failed to establish risks he would face if returned to Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[24] \n  As a secondary argument, the Applicant suggests that the Board erred in referring to the burden of proof under subsection 97(1)(b). He takes issue with the wording at paragraph 26 of the decision that the Board \"does not believe that it is more likely than not that the claimant would be personally targeted for any reason were he to return to Sri Lanka\" when the burden is to show a risk of mistreatment on a balance of probabilities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[25] \n  With respect, there is no merit to this distinction. The Federal Court of Appeal clarified in  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ no 1 at paras 29 that the term \"balance of probabilities\" was equivalent to \"more likely than not\", but with two distinct steps involved as to the burden of proof and legal test. In assessing risk specifically under subsection 97(1)(b), the question, as discussed at para 38 of  \n Li \n , is whether \"it is more likely than not that the individual would be subjected, personally, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if the person was returned to his country of nationality. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[26] \n  In my view, the wording referred to by the Applicant and the Board's overall assessment of risk is consistent with that approach. Even the Applicant recognizes that the correct test is referred to at other points in the decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[27] \n  Indeed, the Board made clear that one of the determinative issues was the \"personal risk of harm for the claimant were he to return to Sri Lanka today.\" There would need to be persuasive evidence of that risk \"on a balance of probabilities\" or to show that it was \"more likely than not.\" The Board uses this terminology throughout its decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[28] \n  The Applicant's reliance on  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ no 547 at paras 8-9 is misplaced. In that instance, Justice Judith Snider's concern was not in relation to the burden of proof on a \"balance of probabilities\" per se but that the Board only considered whether the applicant would not face any torture or cruel and unusual treatment. She found the Board erred by failing to instead refer to the \"risk of\" torture or cruel and unusual treatment as consistent with its mandate under section 97.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[29] \n  Similar concerns do not arise in the present case. As demonstrated, the Board was mindful of its role in considering the evidence of \"risk\" to the Applicant on a balance of probabilities. I must therefore agree with the Respondent that there was no error in referring to the Applicant's burden of proof under subsection 97(1)(b) throughout the decision and making reference to the test that risk be \"more likely than not. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n \n VI.  \n Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[30] \n  The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Board erred in its assessment of his claim of the risk facing a failed refugee claimant and the burden of proof under subsection 97(1)(b) to justify the intervention of this Court. As a consequence, I must dismiss his application for judicial review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[31] \n   \n THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that \n  this application for judicial review is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n ......................... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated May 20, 2011. The Board found that the applicant, Selvaratnam Veerasingam, was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the  \n Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \n , LC 2001, c. 27. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"

La Commission a statué que le demandeur, Selvaratnam Veerasingam, n'était ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la  \n Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés \n , LC 2001, c. 27.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [2] \n  Pour les motifs énoncés ci-après, la demande est rejetée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n I.  \n Les faits  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [3] \n  Le demandeur est un citoyen tamoul du Sri Lanka. Il a présenté une demande d'asile au Canada parce qu'il craignait l'armée sri lankaise et les groupes militants tamouls. Il dit avoir été détenu à de nombreuses reprises entre 1980 et 2009.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [4] \n  Plus précisément, il a soutenu que des soldats sri lankais l'ont détenu pendant un mois et demi en octobre 2008 jusqu'à ce qu'il soit libéré après le versement d'un pot-de-vin par un ami. Il a également allégué s'être fait dire de quitter le pays. Les soldats, quant à eux, ont déclaré qu'il s'était enfui.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [5] \n  Le demandeur a quitté le Sri Lanka en avril 2009 et a traversé la Malaisie, l'Afrique et l'Europe (notamment la Suisse) avant d'arriver au Canada en mai de la même année. Il était âgé de 59 ans au moment de l'audience relative à sa demande d'asile.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n II.  \n La décision visée par le contrôle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [6] \n  La Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas un réfugié au sens de la Convention, notamment en raison de l'absence de témoignage crédible et de preuves corroborant les incidents allégués.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [7] \n  La décision mentionne ce qui suit relativement à la crédibilité du témoignage du demandeur:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n Le Tribunal a trouvé très long et évasif le témoignage du demandeur d'asile pendant l'audience. Il a été très difficile de lui soutirer de l'information. À la question de savoir quand, comment et combien de fois exactement il avait été arrêté ou détenu au cours de la période de trente ans, le demandeur d'asile n'a jamais répondu clairement. Il n'a pas non plus indiqué de façon crédible qu'il craignait pour sa vie ni n'a donné les raisons de sa crainte présumée pendant toutes ces années. Malgré tout, il a décidé de quitter le Sri Lanka à l'âge de 59 ans.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n Fréquemment, les réponses du demandeur d'asile n'étaient pas liées aux questions posées. Dès le début de l'audience, le tribunal s'est assuré que le demandeur d'asile comprenait très bien l'interprète, ce que le demandeur d'asile a confirmé. Au cours de l'audience, le tribunal s'est assuré de nouveau auprès du demandeur d'asile et de l'interprète qu'il n'y avait pas de problème de communication.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [8] \n  La Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas réussi à démontrer de façon crédible qu'un ou des membres d'un groupe militant le pourchassait ou qu'il avait subi des blessures. Des documents inattendus qui ont été présentés au beau milieu de l'audience ont été jugés sans grande valeur probante.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [9] \n  On pouvait également reprocher au demandeur d'avoir tardé à quitter le Sri Lanka et à présenter une demande d'asile. Il était mentionné que malgré les prétentions selon lesquelles il  craignait pour sa vie depuis de nombreuses années et qu'il avait été détenu, le demandeur d'asile a indiqué que, après le paiement du pot-de-vin pour sa mise en liberté, en décembre 2008, il lui a simplement été dit de quitter le pays  et  [i]l n'a pas pu expliquer pourquoi .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [10] \n  Compte tenu de son manque de crédibilité et de l'évolution de la situation au Sri Lanka, la Commission n'a pas cru qu'il était persécuté. Elle a également conclu que personne ne le recherchait. Il n'avait pas établi qu'il était probable qu'il courrait un risque s'il retournait dans son pays d'origine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n III.  \n Les questions en litige  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [11] \n  La question soulevée par le demandeur consiste à déterminer si la Commission a commis une erreur susceptible de révision dans l'évaluation de sa demande.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n IV.  \n La norme de contrôle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [12] \n  Les conclusions quant aux faits et quant à la crédibilité de la Commission doivent être contrôlées selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (voir  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53 et  \n Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 45.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [13] \n  Dans le cadre de l'application de la norme de la raisonnabilité prescrite dans l'arrêt  \n Dunsmuir \n , précité, au paragraphe 47, la Cour doit s'intéresser  principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel  ainsi qu'à  l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [14] \n  À l'opposé, les questions de droit sont assujetties à la norme de la décision correcte (arrêt  \n Dunsmuir \n , précité, au paragraphe 50).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n V.  \n Analyse  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [15] \n  Le demandeur reconnaît que les conclusions de la Commission sont pour la plupart raisonnables. Cependant, il soutient qu'une erreur a découlé de l'absence de discussion du motif pour lequel il ne courrait pas de risque s'il retournait dans son pays parce que sa demande d'asile a été refusée. Il souligne les éléments de preuve qui ont été présentés et mentionnés au paragraphe 19 de la décision de la Commission relativement aux  articles produits par le conseil du demandeur d'asile au sujet du traitement réservé aux Tamouls du Sri Lanka, plus précisément aux demandeurs d'asile qui retournent dans leur pays.  D'après le demandeur, les demandeurs d'asile déboutés qui sont ciblés seraient membres d'un groupe social et la Commission aurait dû traiter de cette question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [16] \n  Le défendeur affirme que la Commission a traité de cette question si l'on interprète ses motifs dans leur contexte. Compte tenu de la mention des documents connexes produits par le conseil, on ne peut pas dire que la Commission a pas tenu compte de cette preuve. Dans ce même paragraphe, la Commission a également conclu que  [d]e même, le demandeur d'asile n'a pas pu convaincre le tribunal des raisons pour lesquelles, après sa mise en liberté, des gens avaient été à sa recherche, sont encore à sa recherche, ou le seraient toujours au Sri Lanka.  Cette déclaration peut être considérée comme une conclusion relative à la question et le demandeur conteste simplement la valeur probante de la preuve.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [17] \n  Le demandeur renvoie la Cour à la décision  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 650, au paragraphe 104, décision dans laquelle il a été reconnu qu'  en général, lorsque est tirée une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité (si elle est raisonnable et prend en compte la preuve), le décideur n'a pas à examiner la demande d'asile plus avant [...]  mais que  [s]i toutefois le demandeur a mentionné des faits mettant en cause un autre motif de persécution, cet élément de la demande doit toujours être examiné, à moins que l'agent des visas n'ait aussi clairement conclu à son manque de crédibilité .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [18] \n  L'erreur est survenue dans la décision  \n Ghirmatsion \n , précitée, parce que la Commission n'a jamais tenu compte du motif additionnel de persécution. Toutefois, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'une telle erreur s'est également produite dans la présente affaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [19] \n  Comme l'a souligné le défendeur, la Commission a déclaré dans ses motifs qu'elle a examiné la preuve documentaire du demandeur concernant le traitement réservé aux Tamouls qui étaient des demandeurs d'asile retournés au Sri Lanka et elle a conclu, sur le fondement de cette preuve, qu'elle n'était pas convaincue  des raisons pour lesquelles [...] des gens [seraient] [...] à sa recherche .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [20] \n  Dans sa réplique, le demandeur semble décrire la question en litige comme une question d'évaluation du caractère suffisant des motifs invoqués quant au risque auquel lié à son retour à titre de demandeur d'asile débouté. Il invoque la décision  \n Administration de l'aéroport international de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no809 pour faire valoir que la Commission n'a pas expliqué le fondement de sa décision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [21] \n  Faisant mention de l'exposé récent de la Cour suprême sur l'exigence relative aux motifs dans  \n Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACS no 62, au paragraphe 18, le défendeur souligne l'extrait cité selon lequel  [i]l ne faut pas examiner les motifs dans l'abstrait; il faut examiner le résultat dans le contexte de la preuve, des arguments des parties et du processus.  Compte tenu du fait que la question déterminante reposait sur la crédibilité et sur le défaut de prouver un risque de danger, il n'était pas déraisonnable d'examiner la preuve relative au risque auquel les demandeurs d'asile déboutés sont exposés et de statuer que le demandeur ne serait pas recherché par qui que ce soit pour quelque motif que ce soit au Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [22] \n  Je suis disposé à souscrire à la thèse du défendeur. Compte tenu de l'existence de réserves sérieuses quant à la crédibilité, la décision de la Commission est conforme aux principes de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité. Bien que la preuve sur cette question ait été traitée brièvement, elle a été examinée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [23] \n  La Commission a raisonnablement soupesé cette preuve et en est venue à une conclusion plus large selon laquelle le demandeur n'avait pas prouvé l'existence de risques auxquels il serait exposé s'il était renvoyé au Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [24] \n  À titre subsidiaire, le demandeur affirme que la Commission a commis une erreur en faisant référence au fardeau de la preuve aux termes de l'alinéa 97(1) \n b) \n . Il conteste le libellé au paragraphe 26 de la décision selon lequel la Commission  ne croit pas qu'il est plus probable que le contraire que le demandeur d'asile serait personnellement ciblé pour quelque raison que ce soit s'il devait retourner au Sri Lanka  alors que le fardeau de la preuve consiste à établir l'existence d'un risque de mauvais traitements selon la prépondérance de la preuve.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [25] \n  Avec égards, cette distinction n'est pas fondée. La Cour d'appel fédérale a précisé dans l'arrêt  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] ACF no 1, au paragraphe 29, que l'expression  prépondérance des probabilités  était équivalente à  plus probable que le contraire , mais que deux étapes distinctes s'appliquent au fardeau de la preuve et au critère juridique. Dans le cadre de l'évaluation du risque aux termes spécifiques de l'alinéa 97(1) \n b) \n , la question, tel qu'il est exposé au paragraphe 38 de  \n Li \n , consiste à déterminer s'il  ne serait pas qu'il soit plus probable que le contraire que la personne soit soumise, personnellement, à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités si elle était renvoyée dans son pays de nationalité.   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [26] \n  Je suis d'avis que le libellé mentionné par le demandeur et l'évaluation globale que fait la Commission du risque sont cohérents avec cette approche. Même le demandeur reconnaît que le critère approprié est mentionné ailleurs dans la décision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [27] \n  De fait, la Commission a établi clairement que l'une des questions déterminantes était le  risque de blessure s'il devait retourner au Sri Lanka aujourd'hui .Il faudrait qu'il existe une preuve convaincante de ce risque  selon la prépondérance de la preuve  ou qu'il soit établi qu'elle était  plus probable que le contraire . La Commission a recours à cette terminologie dans l'ensemble de sa décision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [28] \n  Le demandeur a tort de s'appuyer sur la décision  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no547, aux paragraphes 8 et 9. Dans cette affaire, la juge Judith Snider ne se préoccupait pas du fardeau de la preuve selon la  prépondérance de la preuve  comme telle, mais elle se préoccupait plutôt du fait que la Commission a seulement examiné si la demanderesse éviterait la torture ou les traitements cruels ou inusités. Elle a conclu que la Commission a commis une erreur en évitant de faire plutôt mention du  risque  de torture ou de traitements cruels et inusités conformément à son mandat prévu à l'article 97.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [29] \n  Des préoccupations semblables ne sont pas soulevées en l'espèce. Tel qu'il a été établi, la Commission était consciente de son rôle dans le cadre de l'examen de la preuve de l'existence d'un  risque  pour le demandeur selon la prépondérance des probabilités. Je dois donc souscrire à la thèse du défendeur selon laquelle la mention du fardeau de la preuve qui incombait au demandeur en vertu de l'alinéa 97(1) \n b) \n  dans l'ensemble de la décision et du critère selon lequel le risque est  plus probable que le contraire  ne constituait pas une erreur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n VI.  \n Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [30] \n  Le demandeur n'a pas démontré que la Commission a commis une erreur, qui justifierait l'intervention de la Cour, dans son évaluation de sa prétention selon laquelle il courait un risque à titre de demandeur d'asile débouté et du fardeau de la preuve prévu à l'alinéa 97(1) \n b) \n . Par conséquent, je dois rejeter la demande de contrôle judiciaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n JUGEMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [31] \n   \n LA COUR ORDONNE que \n la demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [End of document]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",

Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[1] \n   \n Near, J. \n : This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated May 20, 2011. The Board determined that the Applicant, Selvaratnam Veerasingam, was not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the  \n Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \n , SC 2001, c 27.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[2] \n  For the reasons set out below, this application is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n I.  \n Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[3] \n  The Applicant is a Tamil citizen of Sri Lanka. He brought a refugee claim in Canada based on a fear of the Sri Lankan army and Tamil militant groups. He alleged having been detained on many occasions between 1980 and 2009.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[4] \n  More specifically, he claimed that Sri Lankan soldiers detained him for one and a half months in October 2008 until he was released as a result of a friend paying a bribe. He also alleged that he was told to leave the country as the soldiers reported that he had escaped.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[5] \n  He left Sri Lanka in April 2009 and traveled through Malaysia, Africa and Europe (notably Switzerland) before arriving in Canada in May of the same year. He was 59 years old at the time of his refugee hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n II.  \n Decision Under Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[6] \n  The Board found that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee due in part to a lack of credible testimony and failure to provide proof corroborating the alleged incidents.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[7] \n  Commenting on the credibility of the Applicant's testimony, the decision states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n The Tribunal found the claimant's testimony throughout the hearing to be protracted and evasive. It was extremely difficult to extract information. He was asked but never made it clear how, when and/or how many times exactly he was arrested or detained, over the thirty year time frame. Nor did he credibly convey that he was in fear for his life, nor why it was that he allegedly feared all of those years, yet only chose to leave Sri Lanka at the age of 59.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n The claimant would frequently answer questions that were not what was being asked. The Tribunal checked at the outset and the claimant confirmed that he fully understood the interpreter. During the hearing the Tribunal reconfirmed with the claimant and the interpreter to ensure that there were no communication issues.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[8] \n  The Board found that the Applicant had failed to credibly demonstrate that anyone from a militant group was after him or that he had suffered injuries. Surprise documents produced in the middle of the hearing were found to be of questionable probative value.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[9] \n  The Applicant was also faulted for the delay in leaving Sri Lanka and making a refugee claim. It was noted that despite claims he was \"in fear for his life for many years and alleged detention, he indicated that following payment of a bribe to secure his release in December 2008, he was told to simply leave the country\" but had provided \"no explanation as to why. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[10] \n  Given his lack of credibility and change in circumstances in Sri Lanka, the Board did not believe he was persecuted. It also concluded that no one was looking for him. He had not established that it was not more likely than not that he was at risk if returned to his country of origin.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n III.  \n Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[11] \n  The issue raised by the Applicant is whether the Board committed a reviewable error in assessing his claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n IV.  \n Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[12] \n  The Board's findings of fact and credibility are to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness (see  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53 and  \n Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 45.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[13] \n  Applying the reasonableness standard as prescribed by  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47, this Court must be \"concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility with in the decision-making process\" as well as \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[14] \n  By contrast, questions of law demand the correctness standard ( \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 50).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n V.  \n Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[15] \n  While the Applicant acknowledges that the Board's findings are reasonable for the most part, he submits that an error resulted in failing to discuss why he would not be at risk as a returning, failed refugee claimant. He points to evidence submitted and referred to at paragraph 19 of the Board's decision of \"articles submitted by the claimant's counsel regarding the treatment of Tamils in Sri Lanka, specifically returned asylum seekers.\" According to the Applicant, failed refugee claimants who are targeted would be a member of a particular social group and this should have been addressed by the Board.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[16] \n  The Respondent contends that the Board addresses this matter when its reasons are read in context. Given the reference to related material submitted by counsel, it cannot be said that the Board ignored this evidence. In that same paragraph, the Board also concluded that \"[f]urther still, the claimant failed to credibly, convey to the Tribunal, that subsequent to his release, he was, is or would be sought after by anyone for any reason in Sri Lanka.\" This can be seen as a finding on the issue and the Applicant is simply challenging the weighing of the evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[17] \n  The Applicant refers the Court to the decision of  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ no 650 at para 104 where it was acknowledged that \"in general, a negative credibility finding (if reasonable and made with regard to the evidence) will mean that the decision maker does not have to look further into the claim\" but \"if the claimant puts forward facts that raise an additional ground of persecution, that part of the claim still needs to be assessed, unless the visa officer clearly finds that part of the claim to also lack credibility. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[18] \n  The error arose in  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  because the Board never considered the additional ground of persecution. However, I am not convinced that this also occurred in the present case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[19] \n  As the Respondent highlights, the Board stated in its reasons that it considered the Applicant's evidence regarding the treatment of Tamils who were returned asylum seekers in Sri Lanka and based on this evidence the Board found that the Applicant would not be \"sought after by anyone for any reason <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[20] \n  In his reply, the Applicant appears to characterize the issue as one of adequacy of reasons on the risk associated with him returning as a failed refugee claimant. He relies on the decision of  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ no 809 to suggest that the Board did not explain the basis for its decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[21] \n  Referring to the Supreme Court's recent elaboration on the requirement of reasons in  \n Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] SCJ no 62 at para 18, the respondent notes the quoted passage that \"[r]easons are not to be reviewed in a vacuum - the result is to be looked at in the context of the evidence, the parties' submissions and the process.\" Considering that the determinative issue was credibility and a failure to establish a personal risk of harm, it was not unreasonable to consider the evidence of risk to failed asylum seekers and determine that the Applicant would not be sought after by anyone for any reason in Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[22] \n  I am prepared to agree with the Respondent's position. In light of serious credibility concerns, the Board's decision accords with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility. Although the evidence on this issue was dealt with briefly, it was considered.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[23] \n  The Board reasonably weighed that evidence and reached a broader conclusion that the Applicant had failed to establish risks he would face if returned to Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[24] \n  As a secondary argument, the Applicant suggests that the Board erred in referring to the burden of proof under subsection 97(1)(b). He takes issue with the wording at paragraph 26 of the decision that the Board \"does not believe that it is more likely than not that the claimant would be personally targeted for any reason were he to return to Sri Lanka\" when the burden is to show a risk of mistreatment on a balance of probabilities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[25] \n  With respect, there is no merit to this distinction. The Federal Court of Appeal clarified in  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ no 1 at paras 29 that the term \"balance of probabilities\" was equivalent to \"more likely than not\", but with two distinct steps involved as to the burden of proof and legal test. In assessing risk specifically under subsection 97(1)(b), the question, as discussed at para 38 of  \n Li \n , is whether \"it is more likely than not that the individual would be subjected, personally, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if the person was returned to his country of nationality. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[26] \n  In my view, the wording referred to by the Applicant and the Board's overall assessment of risk is consistent with that approach. Even the Applicant recognizes that the correct test is referred to at other points in the decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[27] \n  Indeed, the Board made clear that one of the determinative issues was the \"personal risk of harm for the claimant were he to return to Sri Lanka today.\" There would need to be persuasive evidence of that risk \"on a balance of probabilities\" or to show that it was \"more likely than not.\" The Board uses this terminology throughout its decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[28] \n  The Applicant's reliance on  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ no 547 at paras 8-9 is misplaced. In that instance, Justice Judith Snider's concern was not in relation to the burden of proof on a \"balance of probabilities\" per se but that the Board only considered whether the applicant would not face any torture or cruel and unusual treatment. She found the Board erred by failing to instead refer to the \"risk of\" torture or cruel and unusual treatment as consistent with its mandate under section 97.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[29] \n  Similar concerns do not arise in the present case. As demonstrated, the Board was mindful of its role in considering the evidence of \"risk\" to the Applicant on a balance of probabilities. I must therefore agree with the Respondent that there was no error in referring to the Applicant's burden of proof under subsection 97(1)(b) throughout the decision and making reference to the test that risk be \"more likely than not. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n \n VI.  \n Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[30] \n  The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Board erred in its assessment of his claim of the risk facing a failed refugee claimant and the burden of proof under subsection 97(1)(b) to justify the intervention of this Court. As a consequence, I must dismiss his application for judicial review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[31] \n   \n THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that \n  this application for judicial review is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n ......................... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated May 20, 2011. The Board found that the applicant, Selvaratnam Veerasingam, was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the  \n Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \n , LC 2001, c. 27. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court dismissed the application for judicial review, finding the Board’s decision was reasonable. The core of the Board’s decision, and thus the court’s affirmation of it, rested on a lack of credibility attributed to the applicant’s testimony.",

This credibility assessment was central to the court’s upholding of the decision.",
      "The court addressed the applicant’s argument that the Board failed to adequately address the risk faced by returned failed refugee claimants. It found the Board *did* consider evidence regarding the treatment of returned asylum seekers, concluding the Board reasonably determined the applicant would not be targeted upon return, based on the evidence before it.",
      "The court clarified that a negative credibility finding generally allows a decision-maker to forego further investigation into a claim, but acknowledged that if additional grounds of persecution are raised, they must still be assessed – finding that the Board *did* assess the additional risk related to returned claimants.",
      "The court rejected the applicant’s argument regarding the Board’s phrasing of the burden of proof under subsection 97(1)(b), finding the use of “more likely than not” equivalent to “balance of probabilities” as clarified by previous case law. The court emphasized the Board consistently applied the correct legal test for assessing risk – a balance of probabilities – throughout its decision.",
      "The court applied the reasonableness standard of review, focusing on whether the Board’s decision was justified, transparent, and intelligible, and whether it fell within an acceptable range of outcomes given the facts and law.
