    "[1]\nRoy, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the panel) that the applicants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.",
    "[2]\nThe panel agreed that the applicants had been subjected to acts of discrimination and harassment over the years. It nonetheless found that, cumulatively, these acts of persecution and harassment did not amount to persecution.",
    "[3]\nThus, the panel, after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the applicants had not demonstrated the subjective fear required to qualify for protection under the Act. To this effect, the evidence indicated that these incidents had occurred over a long period of time during which the applicants had considered their options. In fact, one attempt to acquire a visitor's visa to Canada was refused in 2006; in 2007 the principal applicant inquired about the possibility of making a refugee claim in England but abandoned the project when he was advised by a lawyer that his chances of success were minimal. He continued to work at his job in Turkey and it was only at the end of 2009, some 14 months after the last incident involving the applicant that he obtained a visitor's visa for the United States, ending up in New York, on December 11, 2009. It seems likely that his real destination was Canada, given that he crossed the border on December 19, 2009, although he did not claim refugee protection until two days later. His spouse and son did not arrive in Canada until September 6, 2011, and they too claimed refugee protection, but they did so as soon as they arrived at the Canadian border.",
    "[4]\nThe panel, after reviewing the documentation available on June 29, 2011, was also of the view that it was less likely that Turkish citizens of the applicants' religious denomination would be subject to persecution if they were to return to Turkey, thereby concluding that there was no objective basis to their fear.",
    "[5]\nLastly, the panel determined that the applicants would not be at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.",
    "[6]\nIt should be noted once again that discrimination and harassment do not amount to persecution.",
    "[7]\nJustice Michel Beaudry of this Court aptly summarized the state of the law in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [34] Persecution has been defined by the Courts as an affliction of repeated acts of cruelty or a particular course or period of systematic infliction of punishment. Mere harassment or discrimination is insufficient (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[8]\nIn this case, the panel concluded that discrimination and harassment, in and of themselves, do not rise to the requisite level of severity.",
    "[9]\nThe standard of review in matters such as these is reasonableness. They involve questions mixed fact and law. The applicants are relying on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to argue that a correctness standard ought to be applied when a panel fails to consider the cumulative effects of incidents of discrimination.",
    "[10]\nI agree that failing to consider the cumulative effects could be a question of law calling for a correctness standard. Conversely, the application of the accumulation will be a question of mixed fact and law reviewable on a reasonableness standard. Put another way, the question of weighing the evidence in order to determine whether there was a sufficient accumulation so as to constitute persecution will be a mixed question. In this case, the panel concluded on two occasions that the accumulation of incidents did not amount to persecution. Indeed, the applicants complain that the \"theory of accumulation\" was not adequately applied. It is not that the theory of accumulation was ignored but rather, that the applicants are not satisfied with the result.",
    "[11]\nIt therefore follows that the panel's decision must be reviewed on a reasonableness standard. Has the deference owed to the decision rendered been overcome by the applicants? I think not. As it is stated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 47, \"[t] ribunals have a margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions\". This is just such a case.",
    "[12]\nIt was reasonable for the panel to conclude that the applicants' behaviour was not consistent with a subjective fear. It was a finding at which the panel could rationally have arrived. The objective evidence did not favour the applicants, even if the panel had agreed that a subjective fear existed. The finding on subjective fear and that regarding an objective basis to that fear were reasonable because they were based on the evidence before the panel.",
    "[13]\nThe facts before the panel were such that, even when added together, the incidents of discrimination and harassment did not amount to the cruelty or the systematic infliction of punishment required to conclude that there was persecution. It was reasonable to find that there was a lack of persecution.",

[2]\nThe court agreed that the plaintiffs had suffered acts of discrimination and harassment over the years. However, he concluded that, cumulatively, these acts of persecution and harassment could not constitute persecution. [3]\nThus, the court, after examining the evidence, concluded that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated the subjective fear required to be able to rely on the Act. To this end, the evidence was that the incidents took place over a long period of time, during which the plaintiffs considered their options. Indeed, an attempt to obtain a visitor visa to Canada was refused in 2006; the main applicant inquired in 2007 in England about the possibility of applying for refugee status to abandon the project when advised by a lawyer that the chances of success were minimal. He continued to work in Turkey and it was not until late 2009, some 14 months after the last incident involving the applicant, that he obtained a visitor visa for the United States, where he ended up in New York on December 11, 2009. It appears that his real destination was Canada since he crossed the border on December 19, 2009, but did not apply for refugee status until two days later. late. His wife and son arrived in Canada only on September 6, 2011, and also requested refugee status, but from the day of their arrival at the Canadian border. [4]\nThe court, after reviewing the documentation available as of June 29, 2011, was also of the opinion that it was less than likely that Turkish citizens of the applicants' religious faith would be subject to persecution if returned to Turkey, thus concluding that there was no objective basis for their fear. [5]\nThe court ultimately agreed that the plaintiffs would not be at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment. [6]\nIt is worth remembering again that discrimination and harassment are not persecution. [7]\nJustice Michel Beaudry of this Court well summarized the state of the law in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>: [34] The courts have defined persecution as the repeated infliction of acts of cruelty or the systematic infliction of punishment over a specified period of time. Harassment and discrimination are not enough in themselves ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). [8]\nIn this case, the court concluded that the discrimination and harassment per se did not reach the required level of seriousness. [9]\nThe standard of judicial review in these matters will be that of reasonableness. These are mixed questions of fact and law. The applicants find support in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to argue that the correctness standard must apply when the court does not consider the cumulative effects of incidents of discrimination. [10]\nI agree that failing to consider cumulation could be a question of law calling for correctness. Furthermore, the application of cumulation will be a mixed question of fact and law reviewable on the basis of a reasonable decision. In other words, the question of weighing the evidence to decide whether there is sufficient accumulation to conclude persecution will be a mixed question. However, in this case, the court twice concluded that the accumulation of incidents does not constitute persecution. In fact, the plaintiffs complain that the theory of accumulation has not been applied adequately. It is not that the theory of accumulation has been ignored. Rather, it is that the applicants are not satisfied with the result. [11]\nIt follows that the court's decision must be reviewed against the standard of reasonableness. Was deference to the decision rendered reversed by the plaintiffs? I don't believe it. As it is said in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>, in paragraph 47, (I) it is open to the administrative court to opt for one or other of the different acceptable rational solutions. This is the case in this case. [12]\nIt was reasonable for the court to conclude that the plaintiffs' behavior did not demonstrate subjective fear. This was a conclusion that the court could rationally reach. The objective evidence did not favor the plaintiffs any more, if indeed the court had accepted a subjective fear. The conclusion on subjective fear and that on an objective basis for this fear were reasonable because they were based on the evidence before the court. [13]\nThe facts before the court were such that even accumulating incidents of discrimination, and even harassment, did not bear the brunt of the cruelty and systematic infliction of punishment. It was reasonable to conclude that there was no persecution. [14]\nConsequently, the application for judicial review is dismissed.

There is no question for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n[15]\nThe application for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board's Refugee Protection Division dated July 11, 2012 is dismissed.\n.........................\nErtugrul Savas, Funda  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC (2001), ch 27, (la Loi) d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (le tribunal) statuant que les demandeurs ne sont ni des réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni des personnes à protéger selon les articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.\n[2]\nLe tribunal a convenu que les demandeurs ont subi au cours des années des actes de discrimination et de harcèlement. Il a cependant conclu que, cumulativement, ces actes de persécution et de harcèlement ne sauraient constituer de la persécution.\n[3]\nAinsi, le tribunal, après l'examen de la preuve, a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas démontré la crainte subjective requise pour pouvoir se prévaloir de la Loi. À cet effet, la preuve était que les incidents avaient eu lieu sur une longue période de temps, durant laquelle les demandeurs avaient considéré leurs options. En effet, une tentative d'obtenir un visa de visiteur au Canada a été refusé en 2006; le demandeur principal s'est enquis en 2007 en Angleterre de la possibilité de faire une demande de statut de réfugié pour abandonner le projet quand avisé par un avocat que les chances de succès étaient minimes. Il a continué à occuper son emploi en Turquie et ce n'est qu'à la fin de 2009, quelque 14 mois après le dernier incident impliquant le demandeur qu'il obtenait un visa de visiteur pour les États-Unis, où il s'est retrouvé, à New York, le 11 décembre 2009. Il semble bien que sa destination réelle était le Canada puisqu'il traversait la frontière le 19 décembre 2009, mais ne demandait le statut de réfugié que deux jours plus tard. Son épouse et son fils sont arrivés au Canada seulement le 6 septembre 2011, et ont aussi demandé le statut de réfugié, mais dès le jour de leur arrivée à la frontière canadienne.\n[4]\nLe tribunal, après examen de la documentation disponible au 29 juin 2011, était aussi d'avis qu'il était moins que probable que des citoyens turcs de la confession religieuse des demandeurs soient l'objet de persécution si retournés en Turquie, concluant ainsi qu'il n'y avait pas de fondement objectif à leur crainte.\n[5]\nLe tribunal a finalement convenu que les demandeurs ne seraient pas à risque de torture ou de traitements cruels et inusités.\n[6]\nIl convient de rappeler à nouveau que discrimination et harcèlement ne sont pas persécution.\n[7]\nLe juge Michel Beaudry de cette Cour a bien résumé l'état du droit dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[34] Les cours ont défini la persécution comme étant l'infliction répétée d'actes de cruauté ou l'infliction systématique d'un châtiment au cours d'une période de temps déterminée. Le harcèlement et la discrimination ne suffisent pas en soi ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[8]\nEn l'espèce, le tribunal a conclu que la discrimination et le harcèlement en soi n'atteignaient pas le niveau de sérieux requis.\n[9]\nLa norme de contrôle judiciaire en ces matières sera celle de la décision raisonnable. Il s'agit de questions mixtes de fait et de droit. Les demandeurs trouvent appui sur\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pour argumenter que la norme de la décision correcte doit trouver application lorsque le tribunal ne considère pas le cumul des effets d'incidents de discrimination.\n[10]\nJe conviens que de négliger de considérer le cumul pourrait être une question de droit appelant la norme de la décision correcte. Par ailleurs, l'application du cumul sera une question mixte de fait et de droit révisable sur la base de la décision raisonnable. Dit autrement, la question de peser la preuve pour décider s'il y a cumul suffisant pour conclure à persécution sera une question mixte. Or, en l'espèce, le tribunal a à deux reprises conclu que le cumul des incidents ne constitue pas de la persécution. De fait, les demandeurs se plaignent que la  théorie du cumul  n'a pas été appliquée adéquatement. Ce n'est pas que la théorie du cumul a été ignorée. C'est plutôt que les demandeurs ne sont pas satisfaits du résultat.\n[11]\nIl s'ensuit que la décision du tribunal doit être révisée au regard de la norme de la raisonnabilité. La déférence pour la décision rendue a-t-elle été renversée par les demandeurs? Je ne le crois pas. Comme il est dit dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47,  (I)l est loisible au tribunal administratif d'opter pour l'une ou l'autre des différentes solutions rationnelles acceptables . Tel est le cas en l'espèce.\n[12]\nIl était raisonnable pour le tribunal de conclure que le comportement des demandeurs ne démontrait pas une crainte subjective. C'était une conclusion à laquelle le tribunal pouvait rationnellement arriver. La preuve objective ne favorisait pas plus les demandeurs, si tant est que le tribunal avait convenu à une crainte subjective. La conclusion sur la crainte subjective et celle sur un fondement objectif à cette crainte étaient raisonnables parce que fondées sur la preuve devant le tribunal.\n[13]\nLes faits devant le tribunal étaient tels que même en accumulant les incidents de discrimination, et même de harcèlement, n'avaient pas la facture de la cruauté et de l'infliction systématique de châtiments. Il était raisonnable de conclure à l'absence de persécution.\n[14]\nEn conséquence, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Il n'y a aucune question à certifier.\nJUGEMENT\n[15]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié rendue le 11 juillet 2012 est rejetée.\n[End of document]",

It was reasonable to conclude that there was no persecution. [14]\nConsequently, the application for judicial review is dismissed. There are no questions to certify.\nJUDGMENT [15]\nThe application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rendered on July 11, 2012 is dismissed.\n[End of document]",

      "Applicants applied for refugee protection in Canada.",

      "A prior visitor visa application to Canada was refused in 2006.",
      "In 2007, the primary applicant explored seeking refugee status in England but abandoned the effort due to a lawyer's assessment of low chances of success.",
      "The primary applicant obtained a visitor visa to the United States in late 2009, arriving in New York on December 11, 2009, and subsequently entered Canada on December 19, 2009.",
      "The applicant's spouse and son arrived in Canada on September 6, 2011, and also claimed refugee protection upon arrival.",

      "Applicants": [
        "The panel failed to adequately consider the cumulative effects of incidents of discrimination and harassment when determining whether persecution existed.",
        "They demonstrated a subjective fear of persecution if returned to Turkey.",
        "They experienced acts of discrimination and harassment.",
        "They sought refugee status as soon as they arrived at the Canadian border (or shortly thereafter).",
        "They argued for a correctness standard of review regarding the cumulative effects of discrimination."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The acts of discrimination and harassment experienced by the applicants did not amount to persecution.",
        "The applicants did not demonstrate the subjective fear required for refugee status.",
        "The applicants had opportunities to seek protection elsewhere (visitor visa applications, inquiry about UK claim) before claiming refugee status in Canada.",
        "There was no objective basis for the applicants’ fear of persecution upon return to Turkey.",
        "The applicants’ behaviour was inconsistent with a genuine subjective fear of persecution.",
        "The panel’s decision was reasonable and within the range of acceptable solutions.",
        "Discrimination and harassment, on their own, do not constitute persecution."

    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The core issue was whether the applicants met the legal threshold for refugee status under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, specifically demonstrating either a subjective fear of persecution or an objective basis for such fear.",
      "The court affirmed the Refugee Protection Division’s (panel’s) finding that while the applicants experienced discrimination and harassment, these did not amount to 'persecution' as legally defined – requiring repeated acts of cruelty or systematic punishment.",
      "The court emphasized the distinction between discrimination/harassment and persecution, citing precedent that mere harassment is insufficient to establish a refugee claim.",
      "The court applied a 'reasonableness' standard of review, acknowledging that failing to consider cumulative effects of discrimination *could* warrant a correctness standard, but ultimately found the panel *did* consider cumulative effects, even if the applicants disagreed with the outcome.",
      "The court found the panel’s assessment of the applicants’ behaviour as inconsistent with a genuine subjective fear was reasonable, pointing to the applicants’ delayed claim, attempts to seek visas and explore options in other countries, and the time elapsed between incidents and the claim.",
      "The court reasoned that the panel’s conclusion regarding the lack of an objective basis for fear – that Turkish citizens of the applicants’ religious denomination were unlikely to face persecution upon return – was also reasonable, based on the evidence presented.",
      "The court deferred to the panel’s assessment of the evidence, stating that tribunals have a 'margin of appreciation' within acceptable and rational solutions, and that the applicants did not overcome this deference.",
      "The court concluded that even when considered cumulatively, the incidents of discrimination and harassment did not reach the level of severity required to constitute persecution under the Act, reinforcing the panel’s decision."
