    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC 56)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nShore, J.\nJanuary 21, 2009.\nCounsel:\nAnthony Karkar, for the applicant;\nSteve Bell, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nAnthony Karkar, Montreal, Quebec, for the applicant;\nJohn H. Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2009] F.T.R. TBEd. FE.028.\nI.\nAu préalable",
    "[1]\nJustice Shore\n: On January 20, 2009 at 9:48 a.m., the plaintiff served the defendant with his motion file seeking a stay of removal to the United States scheduled for January 22, 2009, at 8:00 a.m.",
    "[2]\nThe Court could refuse to hear this last-minute request. A last-minute hearing is detrimental to the defendant because it does not allow him to prepare adequately.",
    "[3]\nThe applicant could have filed his request for a stay within the time limits provided for in\nFederal Courts Rules\n, SOR/98-106. Indeed, it appears from paragraph 24 of the plaintiff's affidavit that he received the notice of summons for the referral on January 7, 2009. However, as appears from paragraph 26 of his affidavit, he waited until January 16, 2009 before asking to defer the referral. No satisfactory explanation for its delay in at least filing the present stay application in the Federal Court has been given.",
    "[4] [7] This Court has repeatedly indicated that the hearing of stay applications filed at the last minute, except in exceptional circumstances, does not promote the interests of justice in that they do not allow the defendant to prepare adequately:\nAs stated by this Court on numerous occasions, \"last minute\" motions for stays force the respondent to respond without adequate preparation, do not facilitate the work of this Court and are not in the interest of justice. A stay is an extraordinary procedure which deserves thorough and thoughtful consideration (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 642).",
    "[5]\nLikewise, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 444, Justice Yves de Montigny ruled as follows: [5] This type of behavior must be discouraged because it harms the proper functioning of the judicial system and harms the defendant. The request for a stay is an exceptional remedy and it can be refused to people who prefer to wait until the last minute to present their case if they do not provide an acceptable explanation justifying their delay...\nII.\nFacts",
    "[6]\nIn September 2003, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) asked Juan Pablo Collantes, son of the plaintiff, to collaborate in their activities. He refused and was beaten. The FARC began monitoring the area around the family home.",
    "[7]\nIn November 2003, her sister Luz Stella was followed by individuals who threatened to rape her. The plaintiff also received a phone call threatening the entire family.",
    "[8]\nAlso, in Peru, the Shining Path had been monitoring the applicant's family since 1994 because his father had refused to give them his land. His brother was killed and one of his half-brothers was imprisoned on terrorism charges.",
    "[9]\nJuan Pablo, son of the applicant, left Colombia on December 18, 2003 towards the United States, the applicant and his daughter Luc Stella joined him on January 8, 2004. Together, they arrived in Canada on January 12, 2004 and claimed refugee status at the Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle border crossing.",
    "[10]\nOn May 13, 2008, the two applications made by the applicant, namely the application for Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) and the application for permanent residence on humanitarian grounds (DRP), were rejected by the PRRA officer.",
    "[11]\nJustice Richard Mosley dismissed two applications for leave and judicial review challenging the latter two negative decisions.",
    "[12]\nA letter, dated December 1, 2008, was sent to the applicant, inviting him to a pre-removal interview on January 7, 2009.",
    "[13]\nOn January 7, 2009, the applicant met with a law enforcement officer.",
    "[14]\nDuring this interview, the agent set the departure date for January 22, 2009, at 8:00 a.m., towards the United States.",
    "[15]\nOn January 16, 2009, a request to the officer to postpone his dismissal date was refused.",
    "[16]\nOn January 19, 2009, the applicant filed a request for authorization and judicial review (DACJ) contesting the refusal to postpone the date of the referral scheduled for January 22, 2009.\nIII.\nIssue in dispute",
    "[17]\nIn order to assess the merits of the motion for a stay, the Court must determine whether the applicant meets the three jurisprudential criteria issued by the Federal Court of Appeal in the case\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (C.I.F.). These three criteria are:\na. the existence of a serious question;\nb. the existence of irreparable harm;\nc. the assessment of the balance of disadvantages.\nIV.\nAnalysis",
    "[18]\nIt should be noted that the three criteria must be met for this Court to grant the requested stay. If even one of these criteria is not met, this Court cannot grant the requested stay.\nA. Serious question",
    "[19]\nThe applicant's motion for a stay is attached to a request for authorization challenging the officer's refusal to postpone the date of dismissal.",
    "[20]\nThe agent has very limited discretion. Thus, among the factors which may be brought forward by an applicant and which may permit the officer to postpone the removal, there are, as decided by this Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>, illness, impediments to travel and perhaps, in cases of long-standing applications which have been made within the required time and which will be rendered shortly; which is not the case in this case. [20] The discretion that a Removal officer may exercise is very limited, and in any case, is restricted to when a removal order will be executed. In deciding when it is \"reasonably practicable\" for a removal order to be executed, a removal officer may consider various factors such as illness, other impediments to traveling, and perhaps in cases of long-standing applications that were brought on a timely basis but have yet to be resolved.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 450).",
    "[21]\nIn the file\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 525, this Court reiterated the principle of the limited discretion of the removal officer and clarified that it was not up to the officer to reassess all the humanitarian factors in a case: [20] It is well established that the removal officer has limited discretion when it comes to postponing the removal of a person subject to an enforceable removal order. Where a valid and enforceable removal order exists, immediate removal should be the rule and postponement the exception. Furthermore, a decision to postpone the removal can only be overturned if it is manifestly unreasonable. (\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act,\nS.C. 2001, c. 27, art. 48;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CanLII), 2003 FC 1081;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CanLII), 2005 FC 229.)",
    "[22] Furthermore, the officer responsible for the removal is not required to postpone the removal of the person in question for the sole reason that he or she intends to file or has filed an H&C application. Furthermore, the removal officer is not required to assess the merits of a pending H&C application or to make his or her own assessment of the humanitarian and compassionate factors that may be considered (\nPadda\n, cited above;\nMorello\n, cited above).\n(Also,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 957 at para. 22).",
    "[23]\nThe applicant's situation is not a source of judicial suspension.",
    "[24]\nThe removals officer can only intervene for departure arrangements, compelling or eminent situations. However, the applicant's situation does not correspond to such situations and the officer did not err in refusing to postpone the date of his removal (page 8 of the applicant's motion file): [21] The Court established that removal officers have a limited discretionary power, which is restricted to postponing the removal due to special or compelling circumstances. [37] It is well established in law that the discretionary power to defer a removal order is very limited. It would be contrary to the aims and objectives of the Act to extend, by judicial declaration, the limited discretion of the removal officer to require a \"mini\" H&C review prior to removal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> paragraph 4 (1st inst.) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (1st inst.) (QL))...\n(Adviento, above; See also: Simoes, above; Williams, above; Prasad, above; Griffith, above.) [22] The plaintiff has not demonstrated that she submitted to the removal officer evidence which could have constituted sufficient justification for the officer to exercise his discretion, which is limited to postponing the removal due to special or compelling circumstances: [45] In the instant case, the measure whose execution is requested to be deferred is a measure that the Minister is obliged to carry out by law. The decision to defer execution must therefore include justification for not complying with a positive obligation imposed by law. This justification must be found in the law, or in another legal obligation that the Minister must respect and which is sufficiently important to authorize him not to respect section 48 of the Act [on immigration, R.S.C. (1985), c. I-2]. (The Court emphasizes.)\n(Wang, above.) [23] The plaintiff simply alleges in her affidavit that the agent \"refused to stay the referral despite being informed about the ongoing sponsorship procedures.\" (Paragraph 16, Applicant's Affidavit, page 12 of the Application File.) [24] It is settled law that a pending sponsorship application is not in itself an obstacle to removal. [52] As to the underlying issue under judicial review, the refusal of the removal officer to defer execution of the removal until the H&C application has been determined, I consider that there is no serious issue to be resolved regarding his conduct. As I explained earlier, a pending H&C application based on separation from family is not in itself grounds for postponing a removal. Treating it as such a reason would result in creating a reprieve that the legislator did not want to include in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 134, Noël J. (then a judge in the Trial Division)...\n(Wang, above; See also: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> paras. 17 to 19 (1st inst.) (QL).)",
    "[25] The Applicant clearly did not submit any evidence that could have provided justification for the removal officer to defer the removal.",
    "[26] Taking into account all of the above, the plaintiff failed to raise a serious question in support of her motion. The request for a stay of removal could be rejected for this reason alone.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2007] A.C.F. No. 988 (QL)). [25]\nThe applicant alleges that the rest of his family in Colombia was going to be established in Canada. [26]\nFor the present, this claim is speculative.",
    "[27]\nThe plaintiff has not demonstrated the existence of a serious question.\nB. Irreparable harm",
    "[28]\nIn the present case, the Applicant had several opportunities to argue that he was at risk for his life and security in his country. However, the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), the Federal Court and the PRRA officer ruled that there was no risk for the applicant.",
    "[29]\nIn the part entitled: Irreparable damage, the plaintiff bases his damage on risks that were assessed as part of his PRRA and CH application.",
    "[30]\nFurthermore, the Court confirmed the decision rendered by the PRRA agent, refusing to grant the DACJ filed against this decision.",
    "[31]\nConsequently, the conclusions drawn by the PRRA officer are considered proven and the applicant has not demonstrated the existence of irreparable harm.",
    "[32]\nIt is important to recall that the concept of irreparable harm was defined by the Court in the case\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 621, by Justice Andrew McKay, as the removal of a person to a country where there is danger to his life and safety.",
    "[33]\nThis decision was followed by Judge Sandra Simpson where, in the case\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 316, she mentioned the following in relation to the definition of irreparable harm established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>, supra: [22] [...] The test is very demanding and I accept its basic principle according to which we mean by irreparable harm something very serious, that is to say something more serious than the regrettable difficulties to which a family separation or a departure will give rise.",
    "[34]\nWith regard to the separation of the applicant from his two children in Canada, case law is consistent on the principle that the separation of the family does not constitute irreparable harm, but rather a normal consequence of a removal. [36] [...]\nAs for the separation of the plaintiff from his wife, the case law is well established to the effect that such separation does not in itself constitute irreparable harm.\n(see, for example,\nCelis\n.\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),\n[2002] A.C.F. no 1679 (FC 1st instance) (QL), 2002 CFPI 1231;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CF) (QL), 2003 FC 913;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CF 1st instance) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CF 1st instance) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CAF) (QL), 2004 CAF 261).\n(<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] A.C.F. no 1377 (QL)",
    "[35]\nAs mentioned by Judge <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (1st instance) (QL): [21] These are the unpleasant and unpleasant consequences of an expulsion. But for the expression irreparable harm to retain some meaning, it must correspond to harm beyond what is inherent in the very notion of expulsion. Being deported means losing your job, being separated from familiar people and places. Expulsion comes with forced separations and broken hearts. There is nothing more to Mr. Melo's situation than the normal consequences of expulsion...",
    "[36]\nFinally, in the case\nSelliah (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),\n2004 CAF 261, [2004] A.C.F. No. 1200 (QL), the Federal Court of Appeal wrote: [13] The removal of people who have remained in Canada without status will always disrupt the way of life they have established here. This will be particularly the case for young children who have no memory of the country they left. However, the difficulties which a referral generally entails cannot in my opinion constitute irreparable harm with regard to the criterion set out in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> judgment, because otherwise a stay of execution would have to be granted in most cases as long as there is a serious question to be decided:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[37]\nFurthermore, in paragraph 8 of the part entitled: Irreparable damage, the plaintiff alludes to article 7 of the\nCharter\nto say that everyone has the right to life, security and liberty.",
    "[38]\nHere is how the Court expressed itself on this point in the context of a motion for a stay: [37] It is clearly established in the case law that the removal of a person from Canada is not contrary to the principles of fundamental justice and that the execution of a removal of deportation does not contravene sections 7 and 12 of the\nCharter\n. (\nCanada (Minister of Employment and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para. 46;\nIsomi Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2006 FC 1394 (CanLII), 2006 FC 1394, [2006] F.C.A. No. 1753 (QL), at para. 32 (Judge Simon Noël).\n(\nAoutlev Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),\n2007 FC 111, [2007] A.C.F. No. 183 (QL).",
    "[39]\nThe plaintiff has not proven the existence of irreparable harm.\nC. Balance of disadvantages",
    "[40]\nIn the part entitled: The balance of inconveniences, the applicant alludes to an application for permanent residence which would still be pending.",
    "[41]\nThere is nothing to demonstrate such a situation in this case.",
    "[42]\nThe plaintiff alleges that he is able to support himself and does not represent a danger to society.",
    "[43]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>, above, the Federal Court of Appeal clarified that criteria of this nature do not constitute a demonstration that the balance of convenience tilts in favor of an applicant. [21] Counsel for the appellants says that since the appellants have no criminal record, are not a security threat and are financially established and socially integrated in Canada, the balance of inconvenience favors maintaining the\nstatus quo\nuntil the outcome of their appeal. [22] I do not share this point of view. They received three adverse administrative decisions, all of which were upheld by the Federal Court. It has been almost four years since they arrived here. In my view, the balance of convenience does not militate in favor of further postponing the fulfillment of their obligation, as persons subject to an enforceable removal order, to leave Canada immediately, nor in favor of further postponing the fulfillment of the Minister's obligation to remove them as soon as circumstances permit: see subsection 48(2) of the IRPA. This is not simply a matter of administrative convenience, but rather the integrity and fairness of Canada's immigration control system, as well as public confidence in that system.",
    "[44]\nIn the absence of a serious question and irreparable harm, the balance of convenience favors the Minister who has an interest in the referral order being executed on the date he has set (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (QL)).",
    "[45]\nIndeed, subsection 48(2) of the IRPA provides:\n48.\n(1) Removal order - The removal order is enforceable since it takes effect as long as it is not subject to a stay.\n(2) Consequence - the foreign national subject to the enforceable removal order must immediately leave the territory of Canada, the measure to be applied as soon as circumstances permit.\n48.\n(1) Enforceable removal order - A removal order is enforceable if it has come into force and is not stayed.\n(2) Effect - If a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as it reasonably practicable.\nv.\nConclusion",
    "[46]\nTaking into account all of the above, the applicant does not meet the criteria of case law relating to obtaining a judicial stay.\nJUDGEMENT",
    "[47]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that\nthe request for a stay of execution is rejected.\n[End of document]"

  "full_text": "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC 56)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nShore, J.\nJanuary 21, 2009.\nCounsel:\nAnthony Karkar, for the applicant;\nSteve Bell, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nAnthony Karkar, Montreal, Quebec, for the applicant;\nJohn H. Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2009] F.T.R. TBEd. FE.028.\nI.\nAu préalable\n[1]\nLe juge Shore\n: Le 20 janvier 2009 à 9h48, le demandeur a signifié au défendeur son dossier de requête en vue d'obtenir un sursis au renvoi vers les États-Unis prévu pour le 22 janvier 2009, à 08h00.\n[2]\nLa Cour pourrait refuser d'entendre cette demande de dernière minute. Une audition de dernière minute porte préjudice au défendeur puisqu'elle ne lui permet pas de se préparer adéquatement.\n[3]\nLe demandeur aurait pu déposer sa requête en sursis dans les délais prévus aux\nRègles des Cours fédérales\n, DORS/98-106. En effet, il appert du paragraphe 24 de l'affidavit du demandeur qu'il a reçu l'avis de convocation pour le renvoi, le 7 janvier 2009. Toutefois, tel qu'il appert du paragraphe 26 de son affidavit, il a attendu jusqu'au 16 janvier 2009 avant de demander de différer le renvoi. Aucune explication satisfaisante pour expliquer son retard à au moins déposer la présente requête en sursis devant la Cour fédérale a été donnée.\n[4]\n[7] Cette Cour a indiqué à maintes reprises que l'audition de demandes de sursis déposées à la dernière minute, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, ne favorise pas l'intérêt de la justice en ce qu'elles ne permettent pas notamment à la partie défenderesse de se préparer adéquatement:\nAs stated by this Court in numerous occasions, \" last minute\" motions for stays force the respondent to respond without adequate preparation, do not facilitate the work of this Court and are not in the interest of justice. A stay is an extraordinary procedure which deserves thorough and thoughtful consideration (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 642).\n[5]\nDe même, dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 444, le juge Yves de Montigny a statué comme suit:\n[5] Ce genre de comportement doit être découragé car il nuit au bon fonctionnement du système judiciaire et porte préjudice au défendeur. La demande de sursis est une voie de recours exceptionnelle et elle peut être refusée aux personnes qui préfèrent attendre à la dernière minute pour présenter leur cause s'ils ne fournissent pas d'explication acceptable justifiant leur retard ...\nII.\nFaits\n[6]\nEn septembre 2003, les Forces Armées Révolutionnaires de la Colombie (FARC) ont demandé à Juan Pablo Collantes, fils du demandeur, de collaborer dans leurs activités. Il a refusé et a été battu. Les FARC ont commencé à surveiller les environs de la maison familiale.\n[7]\nEn novembre 2003, sa sur Luz Stella a été suivie par des individus qui ont menacé de la violer. Le demandeur a aussi reçu un appel téléphonique menaçant toute la famille.\n[8]\nAussi, au Pérou, le Sentier Lumineux surveillait la famille du demandeur depuis 1994 car son père avait refusé de leur céder ses terres. Son frère a été tué et un de ses demi-frères a été incarcéré pour des accusations de terrorisme.\n[9]\nJuan Pablo, fils du demandeur, a quitté la Colombie le 18 décembre 2003 en direction des États-Unis, le demandeur et sa fille Luc Stella l'ont rejoint le 8 janvier 2004. Ensemble, ils sont arrivés au Canada le 12 janvier 2004 et ont revendiqué le statut de réfugié au poste frontalier de Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle.\n[10]\nLe 13 mai 2008, les deux demandes effectuées par le requérant, soit la demande d'Examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR) et la demande de résidence permanente pour des considérations humanitaires (DRP), ont été rejetées par l'agent d'ERAR.\n[11]\nLe juge Richard Mosley a rejeté deux demandes d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire contestant ces deux dernières décisions négatives.\n[12]\nUne lettre, datée du 1 décembre 2008, a été envoyée au demandeur, le convoquant à une entrevue préalable au renvoi le 7 janvier 2009.\n[13]\nLe 7 janvier 2009, le demandeur a rencontré un agent d'exécution de la loi.\n[14]\nLors de cette entrevue, l'agent a fixé la date de départ au 22 janvier 2009, à 08h00, en direction des États-Unis.\n[15]\nLe 16 janvier 2009, une demande à l'agent de reporter sa date de renvoi a été refusé.\n[16]\nLe 19 janvier 2009, le demandeur a déposé une demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire (DACJ) contestant le refus de reporter la date du renvoi prévu pour le 22 janvier 2009.\nIII.\nQuestion en litige\n[17]\nAfin d'évaluer le bien-fondé de la requête en sursis, la Cour doit déterminer si le demandeur satisfait aux trois critères jurisprudentiels émis par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'affaire\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.). Ces trois critères sont les suivants:\na. l'existence d'une question sérieuse;\nb. l'existence d'un préjudice irréparable;\nc. l'évaluation de la balance des inconvénients.\nIV.\nAnalyse\n[18]\nIl est à noter que les trois critères doivent être rencontrés pour que cette Cour accorde le sursis demandé. Si un seul de ces critères n'est pas rencontré, cette Cour ne peut pas accorder le sursis demandé.\nA. Question sérieuse\n[19]\nLa requête en sursis du demandeur est greffée à une demande d'autorisation contestant le refus de l'agent de reporter la date du renvoi.\n[20]\nL'agent a un pouvoir discrétionnaire très limité. Ainsi, parmi les facteurs pouvant être apportés par un demandeur et qui peuvent permettre à l'agent de reporter le renvoi, il y a, comme l'a décidé la présente Cour dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la maladie, des empêchements de voyager et peut-être, dans des cas de demandes de longue date qui ont été effectuées dans le délai requis et qui seront rendues sous peu; ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'espèce.\n[20] The discretion that a Removal officer may exercise is very limited, and in any case, is restricted to when a removal order will be executed. In deciding when it is \"reasonably practicable\" for a removal order to be executed, a removal officer may consider various factors such as illness, other impediments to travelling, and perhaps in cases of long-standing applications that were brought on a timely basis but have yet to be resolved.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 450).\n[21]\nDans le dossier\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 525, cette Cour réitérait le principe de la discrétion limitée de l'agent des renvois et précisait qu'il ne revenait pas à l'agent de réévaluer l'ensemble des facteurs d'ordre humanitaire d'un dossier:\n[20] Il est bien établi que l'agent chargé du renvoi possède un pouvoir discrétionnaire limité lorsqu'il s'agit de reporter le renvoi d'une personne visée par une mesure de renvoi exécutoire. Lorsqu'il existe une mesure de renvoi valide et exécutoire, le renvoi immédiat doit être la règle et le report de la mesure l'exception. De plus, une décision relative au report du renvoi ne peut être annulée que si elle est manifestement déraisonnable. (\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nL.C. 2001, ch. 27, art. 48;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2003 CF 1081;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2005 CF 229.)\n[22] De plus, l'agent chargé du renvoi n'est pas tenu de reporter le renvoi de la personne en cause pour la seule raison que celle-ci a l'intention de déposer ou a déposé une demande CH. En outre, l'agent chargé du renvoi n'est pas tenu d'évaluer le bien-fondé d'une demande CH en instance ni d'effectuer sa propre évaluation des facteurs d'ordre humanitaire susceptibles d'être pris en considération (\nPadda\n, précitée;\nMorello\n, précitée).\n(Également,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 957 au par. 22).\n[23]\nLa situation du demandeur n'est pas source de sursis judiciaire.\n[24]\nL'agent des renvois ne peut intervenir que pour les arrangements de départ, des situations impérieuses ou éminentes. Or, la situation du demandeur ne correspond pas à de telles situations et l'agent n'a pas commis d'erreur en refusant de reporter la date de son renvoi (page 8 du dossier de requête du demandeur):\n[21] La Cour a établi que les agents de renvoi ont un pouvoir discrétionnaire limité, qui se restreint à reporter le renvoi en raison de circonstances spéciales ou impérieuses.\n[37] Il est bien établi en droit que le pouvoir discrétionnaire de différer une mesure de renvoi est fort restreint. Il serait contraire aux buts et objectifs de la Loi d'étendre, au moyen d'une déclaration judiciaire, le pouvoir discrétionnaire restreint que possède l'agent chargé du renvoi, de façon à exiger un \"mini\" examen des raisons d'ordre humanitaire avant le renvoi ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 4 (1re inst.) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1re inst.) (QL))...\n(Adviento, ci-dessus; Voir également: Simoes, ci-dessus; Williams, ci-dessus; Prasad, ci-dessus; Griffith, ci-dessus.)\n[22] La demanderesse n'a pas démontré qu'elle avait soumis à l'agent de renvoi des éléments de preuve qui auraient pu constituer une justification suffisante permettant à l'agent d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire, qui se restreint à reporter le renvoi en raison de circonstances spéciales ou impérieuses:\n[45] En l'instance, la mesure dont on demande de différer l'exécution est une mesure que le ministre a l'obligation d'exécuter selon la loi. La décision de différer l'exécution doit donc comporter une justification pour ne pas se conformer à une obligation positive imposée par la loi. Cette justification doit se trouver dans la loi, ou dans une autre obligation juridique que le ministre doit respecter et qui est suffisamment importante pour l'autoriser à ne pas respecter l'article 48 de la Loi [sur l'immigration, L.R.C. (1985), ch. I-2]. (La Cour souligne.)\n(Wang, ci-dessus.)\n[23] La demanderesse allègue tout simplement dans son affidavit que l'agente \"a refusé de surseoir au renvoi malgré qu'elle fut informé sur les procédure des parrainage en cours\". (Paragraphe 16, Affidavit de la demanderesse, page 12 du Dossier de requête.)\n[24] Il est de droit constant qu'une demande pendante de parrainage n'est pas en soi un obstacle au renvoi.\n[52] Quant à la question soumise au contrôle judiciaire sous-jacent, le refus de l'agent chargé du renvoi de différer l'exécution du renvoi jusqu'à ce qu'on ait tranché la demande invoquant des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, je considère qu'il n'y a pas de question sérieuse à trancher au sujet de sa conduite. Comme je l'ai expliqué plus tôt, une demande pendante invoquant des motifs d'ordre humanitaire fondée sur la séparation d'avec la famille n'est pas en soi un motif de remettre un renvoi à plus tard. La traiter comme étant un tel motif aurait pour résultat de créer un sursis que le législateur n'a pas voulu inclure dans la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 134, le juge Noël (alors juge à la Section de première instance)...\n(Wang, ci-dessus ; Voir également:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 17 à 19 (1e inst.) (QL).)\n[25] La demanderesse n'a de toute évidence soumis aucun élément de preuve qui aurait pu constituer une justification permettant à l'agent de renvoi de reporter le renvoi.\n[26] Tenant compte de tout ce qui précède, la demanderesse a fait défaut de soulever une question sérieuse au soutien de sa requête. La demande d'un sursis de renvoi pourrait être rejetée pour ce seul motif.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] A.C.F. no 988 (QL)).\n[25]\nLe demandeur allègue que le reste de sa famille qui se trouve en Colombie allait obtenir son établissement au Canada.\n[26]\nPour le présent, cette prétention est spéculative.\n[27]\nLe demandeur n'a pas démontré l'existence d'une question sérieuse.\nB. Préjudice irréparable\n[28]\nEn l'espèce, le demandeur a eu à plusieurs reprises l'occasion de faire valoir qu'il courait un risque pour sa vie et sa sécurité dans son pays. Or, la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (CISR), la Cour fédérale et l'agent d'ERAR ont jugé qu'il n'y avait pas de risques pour le demandeur.\n[29]\nDans la partie intitulée:  Les dommages irréparables , le demandeur fonde son préjudice sur des risques qui ont été évalués dans le cadre de sa demande d'ERAR et de CH.\n[30]\nDe plus, la Cour a confirmé la décision rendue par l'agent d'ERAR, en refusant d'accorder la DACJ déposée à l'encontre de cette décision.\n[31]\nPar conséquent, les conclusions tirées par l'agent d'ERAR sont tenues pour avérées et le demandeur n'a pas démontré l'existence d'un préjudice irréparable.\n[32]\nIl importe de rappeler que la notion de préjudice irréparable a été définie par la Cour dans l'affaire\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 621, par le juge Andrew McKay, comme étant le renvoi d'une personne vers un pays où il existe un danger pour sa vie et sa sécurité.\n[33]\nCette décision fut suivie par la juge Sandra Simpson où, dans l'affaire\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 316, elle y mentionnait ce qui suit relativement à la définition du préjudice irréparable établi dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité:\n[22] [...] Le critère est très exigeant et j'admets son principe de base selon lequel on entend par préjudice irréparable quelque chose de très grave, c'est-à-dire quelque chose de plus grave que les regrettables difficultés auxquelles vont donner lieu une séparation familiale ou un départ.\n[34]\nEn ce qui concerne la séparation du demandeur avec ses deux enfants au Canada, la jurisprudence est constante sur le principe que la séparation de la famille ne constitue pas un préjudice irréparable, mais bien une conséquence normale d'un renvoi.\n[36] [...]\nQuant à la séparation du demandeur d'avec son épouse, la jurisprudence est bien établie à l'effet que semblable séparation ne constitue pas en soi un préjudice irréparable\n(voir, par exemple,\nCelis\n.\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'immigration),\n[2002] A.C.F. no 1679 (CF 1ere instance) (QL), 2002 CFPI 1231;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF) (QL), 2003 CF 913;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1ere instance) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1ere instance) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) (QL), 2004 CAF 261).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.F. no 1377 (QL)\n[35]\nAinsi que le mentionnait le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1re inst.) (QL):\n[21] Ce sont là les conséquences déplaisantes et désagréables d'une expulsion. Mais pour que l'expression  préjudice irréparable  conserve un peu de sens, elle doit correspondre à un préjudice au-delà de ce qui est inhérent à la notion même d'expulsion. Être expulsé veut dire perdre son emploi, être séparé des gens et des endroits connus. L'expulsion s'accompagne de séparations forcées et de curs brisés. Il n'y a rien de plus dans la situation de M. Melo que les conséquences normales d'une expulsion...\n[36]\nEnfin, dans l'affaire\nSelliah (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration),\n2004 CAF 261, [2004] A.C.F. no 1200 (QL), la Cour d'appel fédérale écrivait ceci:\n[13] Le renvoi de personnes qui sont demeurées au Canada sans statut bouleversera toujours le mode de vie qu'elles se sont donné ici. Ce sera le cas en particulier de jeunes enfants qui n'ont aucun souvenir du pays qu'ils ont quitté. Néanmoins, les difficultés qu'entraîne généralement un renvoi ne peuvent à mon avis constituer un préjudice irréparable au regard du critère exposé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , car autrement il faudrait accorder un sursis d'exécution dans la plupart des cas dès lors qu'il y aura une question sérieuse à trancher:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[37]\nDe plus, au paragraphe 8 de la partie intitulée:  Les dommages irréparables , le demandeur fait allusion à l'article 7 de la\nCharte\npour dire que chacun a droit à la vie, à la sécurité et à la liberté.\n[38]\nVoici comment la Cour s'est exprimée sur ce point dans le cadre d'une requête en sursis:\n[37] Il est clairement établi dans la jurisprudence que le renvoi d'une personne du Canada n'est pas contraire aux principes de justice fondamentale et que l'exécution d'un renvoi de déportation ne va pas à l'encontre des articles 7 et 12 de la\nCharte\n. (\nCanada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para. 46;\nIsomi Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)\n, 2006 CF 1394 (CanLII), 2006 CF 1394, [2006] A.C.F. no 1753 (QL), au par. 32 (juge Simon Noël).\n(\nAoutlev Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration),\n2007 CF 111, [2007] A.C.F. no 183 (QL).\n[39]\nLe demandeur n'a pas prouvé l'existence d'un préjudice irréparable.\nC. Balance des inconvénients\n[40]\nDans la partie intitulée:  La balance des inconvénients , le demandeur fait allusion à une demande de résidence permanente qui serait toujours pendante.\n[41]\nIl n'y a rien qui démontre une telle situation en l'espèce.\n[42]\nLe demandeur allègue qu'il est en mesure de subvenir à ses besoins et qu'il ne représente pas un danger pour la société.\n[43]\nDans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, la Cour d'appel fédérale précisait que les critères de cette nature ne constituent pas une démonstration que la balance des inconvénients penche en faveur d'un demandeur.\n[21] L'avocate des appelants dit que, puisque les appelants n'ont aucun casier judiciaire, qu'ils ne sont pas une menace pour la sécurité et qu'ils sont financièrement établis et socialement intégrés au Canada, l'équilibre des inconvénients milite en faveur du maintien du\nstatu quo\njusqu'à l'issue de leur appel.\n[22] Je ne partage pas ce point de vue. Ils ont reçu trois décisions administratives défavorables, qui ont toutes été confirmées par la Cour fédérale. Il y a bientôt quatre ans qu'ils sont arrivés ici. À mon avis, l'équilibre des inconvénients ne milite pas en faveur d'un nouveau report de l'accomplissement de leur obligation, en tant que personnes visées par une mesure de renvoi exécutoire, de quitter le Canada immédiatement, ni en faveur d'un nouveau report de l'accomplissement de l'obligation du ministre de les renvoyer dès que les circonstances le permettront: voir le paragraphe 48(2) de la LIPR. Il ne s'agit pas simplement d'une question de commodité administrative, il s'agit plutôt de l'intégrité et de l'équité du système canadien de contrôle de l'immigration, ainsi que de la confiance du public dans ce système.\n[44]\nEn l'absence de question sérieuse et de préjudice irréparable, la balance des inconvénients favorise le Ministre qui a intérêt à ce que l'ordonnance de renvoi soit exécutée à la date qu'il a fixée (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\n[45]\nEn effet, le paragraphe 48(2) de la LIPR prévoit:\n48.\n(1) Mesure de renvoi - La mesure de renvoi est exécutoire depuis sa prise d'effet dès lors qu'elle ne fait pas l'objet d'un sursis.\n(2) Conséquence - l'étranger visé par la mesure de renvoi exécutoire doit immédiatement quitter le territoire du Canada, la mesure devant être appliquée dès que les circonstances le permettent.\n48.\n(1) Enforceable removal order - A removal order is enforceable if it has come into force and is not stayed.\n(2) Effect - If a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as it reasonably practicable.\nV.\nConclusion\n[46]\nCompte tenu de tout ce qui précède, le demandeur ne rencontre pas les critères de la jurisprudence relativement à l'obtention d'un sursis judiciaire.\nJUGEMENT\n[47]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\nla demande de sursis soit rejetée.\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC 56)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nShore, J.\nJanuary 21, 2009.\nCounsel:\nAnthony Karkar, for the applicant;\nSteve Bell, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nAnthony Karkar, Montreal, Quebec, for the applicant;\nJohn H. Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2009] F.T.R. TBEd. FE.028.\nI.\nAu préalable\n\n[1]\nJustice Shore\n: On January 20, 2009 at 9:48 a.m., the plaintiff served the defendant with his motion file seeking a stay of removal to the United States scheduled for January 22, 2009, at 8:00 a.m.\n\n[2]\nThe Court could refuse to hear this last-minute request. A last-minute hearing is detrimental to the defendant because it does not allow him to prepare adequately.\n\n[3]\nThe applicant could have filed his request for a stay within the time limits provided for in\nFederal Courts Rules\n, SOR/98-106. Indeed, it appears from paragraph 24 of the plaintiff's affidavit that he received the notice of summons for the referral on January 7, 2009. However, as appears from paragraph 26 of his affidavit, he waited until January 16, 2009 before asking to defer the referral. No satisfactory explanation for its delay in at least filing the present stay application in the Federal Court has been given.\n\n[4] [7] This Court has repeatedly indicated that the hearing of stay applications filed at the last minute, except in exceptional circumstances, does not promote the interests of justice in that they do not allow the defendant to prepare adequately:\nAs stated by this Court on numerous occasions, \"last minute\" motions for stays force the respondent to respond without adequate preparation, do not facilitate the work of this Court and are not in the interest of justice. A stay is an extraordinary procedure which deserves thorough and thoughtful consideration (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 642).\n\n[5]\nLikewise, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 444, Justice Yves de Montigny ruled as follows: [5] This type of behavior must be discouraged because it harms the proper functioning of the judicial system and harms the defendant. The request for a stay is an exceptional remedy and it can be refused to people who prefer to wait until the last minute to present their case if they do not provide an acceptable explanation justifying their delay...\nII.\nFacts\n\n[6]\nIn September 2003, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) asked Juan Pablo Collantes, son of the plaintiff, to collaborate in their activities. He refused and was beaten. The FARC began monitoring the area around the family home.\n\n[7]\nIn November 2003, her sister Luz Stella was followed by individuals who threatened to rape her. The plaintiff also received a phone call threatening the entire family.\n\n[8]\nAlso, in Peru, the Shining Path had been monitoring the applicant's family since 1994 because his father had refused to give them his land. His brother was killed and one of his half-brothers was imprisoned on terrorism charges.\n\n[9]\nJuan Pablo, son of the applicant, left Colombia on December 18, 2003 towards the United States, the applicant and his daughter Luc Stella joined him on January 8, 2004. Together, they arrived in Canada on January 12, 2004 and claimed refugee status at the Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle border crossing.\n\n[10]\nOn May 13, 2008, the two applications made by the applicant, namely the application for Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) and the application for permanent residence on humanitarian grounds (DRP), were rejected by the PRRA officer.\n\n[11]\nJustice Richard Mosley dismissed two applications for leave and judicial review challenging the latter two negative decisions.\n\n[12]\nA letter, dated December 1, 2008, was sent to the applicant, inviting him to a pre-removal interview on January 7, 2009.\n\n[13]\nOn January 7, 2009, the applicant met with a law enforcement officer.\n\n[14]\nDuring this interview, the agent set the departure date for January 22, 2009, at 8:00 a.m., towards the United States.\n\n[15]\nOn January 16, 2009, a request to the officer to postpone his dismissal date was refused.\n\n[16]\nOn January 19, 2009, the applicant filed a request for authorization and judicial review (DACJ) contesting the refusal to postpone the date of the referral scheduled for January 22, 2009.\nIII.\nIssue in dispute\n\n[17]\nIn order to assess the merits of the motion for a stay, the Court must determine whether the applicant meets the three jurisprudential criteria issued by the Federal Court of Appeal in the case\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (C.I.F.). These three criteria are:\na. the existence of a serious question;\nb. the existence of irreparable harm;\nc. the assessment of the balance of disadvantages.\nIV.\nAnalysis\n\n[18]\nIt should be noted that the three criteria must be met for this Court to grant the requested stay. If even one of these criteria is not met, this Court cannot grant the requested stay.\nA. Serious question\n\n[19]\nThe applicant's motion for a stay is attached to a request for authorization challenging the officer's refusal to postpone the date of dismissal.\n\n[20]\nThe agent has very limited discretion. Thus, among the factors which may be brought forward by an applicant and which may permit the officer to postpone the removal, there are, as decided by this Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>, illness, impediments to travel and perhaps, in cases of long-standing applications which have been made within the required time and which will be rendered shortly; which is not the case in this case. [20] The discretion that a Removal officer may exercise is very limited, and in any case, is restricted to when a removal order will be executed. In deciding when it is \"reasonably practicable\" for a removal order to be executed, a removal officer may consider various factors such as illness, other impediments to traveling, and perhaps in cases of long-standing applications that were brought on a timely basis but have yet to be resolved.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 450).\n\n[21]\nIn the file\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 525, this Court reiterated the principle of the limited discretion of the removal officer and clarified that it was not up to the officer to reassess all the humanitarian factors in a case: [20] It is well established that the removal officer has limited discretion when it comes to postponing the removal of a person subject to an enforceable removal order. Where a valid and enforceable removal order exists, immediate removal should be the rule and postponement the exception. Furthermore, a decision to postpone the removal can only be overturned if it is manifestly unreasonable. (\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act,\nS.C. 2001, c. 27, art. 48;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CanLII), 2003 FC 1081;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CanLII), 2005 FC 229.)\n\n[22] Furthermore, the officer responsible for the removal is not required to postpone the removal of the person in question for the sole reason that he or she intends to file or has filed an H&C application. Furthermore, the removal officer is not required to assess the merits of a pending H&C application or to make his or her own assessment of the humanitarian and compassionate factors that may be considered (\nPadda\n, cited above;\nMorello\n, cited above).\n(Also,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 957 at para. 22).\n\n[23]\nThe applicant's situation is not a source of judicial suspension.\n\n[24]\nThe removals officer can only intervene for departure arrangements, compelling or eminent situations. However, the applicant's situation does not correspond to such situations and the officer did not err in refusing to postpone the date of his removal (page 8 of the applicant's motion file): [21] The Court established that removal officers have a limited discretionary power, which is restricted to postponing the removal due to special or compelling circumstances. [37] It is well established in law that the discretionary power to defer a removal order is very limited. It would be contrary to the aims and objectives of the Act to extend, by judicial declaration, the limited discretion of the removal officer to require a \"mini\" H&C review prior to removal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> paragraph 4 (1st inst.) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (1st inst.) (QL))...\n(Adviento, above; See also: Simoes, above; Williams, above; Prasad, above; Griffith, above.) [22] The plaintiff has not demonstrated that she submitted to the removal officer evidence which could have constituted sufficient justification for the officer to exercise his discretion, which is limited to postponing the removal due to special or compelling circumstances: [45] In the instant case, the measure whose execution is requested to be deferred is a measure that the Minister is obliged to carry out by law. The decision to defer execution must therefore include justification for not complying with a positive obligation imposed by law. This justification must be found in the law, or in another legal obligation that the Minister must respect and which is sufficiently important to authorize him not to respect section 48 of the Act [on immigration, R.S.C. (1985), c. I-2]. (The Court emphasizes.)\n(Wang, above.) [23] The plaintiff simply alleges in her affidavit that the agent \"refused to stay the referral despite being informed about the ongoing sponsorship procedures.\" (Paragraph 16, Applicant's Affidavit, page 12 of the Application File.) [24] It is settled law that a pending sponsorship application is not in itself an obstacle to removal. [52] As to the underlying issue under judicial review, the refusal of the removal officer to defer execution of the removal until the H&C application has been determined, I consider that there is no serious issue to be resolved regarding his conduct. As I explained earlier, a pending H&C application based on separation from family is not in itself grounds for postponing a removal. Treating it as such a reason would result in creating a reprieve that the legislator did not want to include in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 134, Noël J. (then a judge in the Trial Division)...\n(Wang, above; See also: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> paras. 17 to 19 (1st inst.) (QL).)\n\n[25] The Applicant clearly did not submit any evidence that could have provided justification for the removal officer to defer the removal.\n\n[26] Taking into account all of the above, the plaintiff failed to raise a serious question in support of her motion. The request for a stay of removal could be rejected for this reason alone.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2007] A.C.F. No. 988 (QL)). [25]\nThe applicant alleges that the rest of his family in Colombia was going to be established in Canada. [26]\nFor the present, this claim is speculative.\n\n[27]\nThe plaintiff has not demonstrated the existence of a serious question.\nB. Irreparable harm\n\n[28]\nIn the present case, the Applicant had several opportunities to argue that he was at risk for his life and security in his country. However, the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), the Federal Court and the PRRA officer ruled that there was no risk for the applicant.\n\n[29]\nIn the part entitled: Irreparable damage, the plaintiff bases his damage on risks that were assessed as part of his PRRA and CH application.\n\n[30]\nFurthermore, the Court confirmed the decision rendered by the PRRA agent, refusing to grant the DACJ filed against this decision.\n\n[31]\nConsequently, the conclusions drawn by the PRRA officer are considered proven and the applicant has not demonstrated the existence of irreparable harm.\n\n[32]\nIt is important to recall that the concept of irreparable harm was defined by the Court in the case\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 621, by Justice Andrew McKay, as the removal of a person to a country where there is danger to his life and safety.\n\n[33]\nThis decision was followed by Judge Sandra Simpson where, in the case\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 316, she mentioned the following in relation to the definition of irreparable harm established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>, supra: [22] [...] The test is very demanding and I accept its basic principle according to which we mean by irreparable harm something very serious, that is to say something more serious than the regrettable difficulties to which a family separation or a departure will give rise.\n\n[34]\nWith regard to the separation of the applicant from his two children in Canada, case law is consistent on the principle that the separation of the family does not constitute irreparable harm, but rather a normal consequence of a removal. [36] [...]\nAs for the separation of the plaintiff from his wife, the case law is well established to the effect that such separation does not in itself constitute irreparable harm.\n(see, for example,\nCelis\n.\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),\n[2002] A.C.F. no 1679 (FC 1st instance) (QL), 2002 CFPI 1231;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CF) (QL), 2003 FC 913;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CF 1st instance) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CF 1st instance) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CAF) (QL), 2004 CAF 261).\n(<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] A.C.F. no 1377 (QL)\n\n[35]\nAs mentioned by Judge <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (1st instance) (QL): [21] These are the unpleasant and unpleasant consequences of an expulsion. But for the expression irreparable harm to retain some meaning, it must correspond to harm beyond what is inherent in the very notion of expulsion. Being deported means losing your job, being separated from familiar people and places. Expulsion comes with forced separations and broken hearts. There is nothing more to Mr. Melo's situation than the normal consequences of expulsion...\n\n[36]\nFinally, in the case\nSelliah (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),\n2004 CAF 261, [2004] A.C.F. No. 1200 (QL), the Federal Court of Appeal wrote: [13] The removal of people who have remained in Canada without status will always disrupt the way of life they have established here. This will be particularly the case for young children who have no memory of the country they left. However, the difficulties which a referral generally entails cannot in my opinion constitute irreparable harm with regard to the criterion set out in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> judgment, because otherwise a stay of execution would have to be granted in most cases as long as there is a serious question to be decided:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[37]\nFurthermore, in paragraph 8 of the part entitled: Irreparable damage, the plaintiff alludes to article 7 of the\nCharter\nto say that everyone has the right to life, security and liberty.\n\n[38]\nHere is how the Court expressed itself on this point in the context of a motion for a stay: [37] It is clearly established in the case law that the removal of a person from Canada is not contrary to the principles of fundamental justice and that the execution of a removal of deportation does not contravene sections 7 and 12 of the\nCharter\n. (\nCanada (Minister of Employment and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para. 46;\nIsomi Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2006 FC 1394 (CanLII), 2006 FC 1394, [2006] F.C.A. No. 1753 (QL), at para. 32 (Judge Simon Noël).\n(\nAoutlev Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),\n2007 FC 111, [2007] A.C.F. No. 183 (QL).\n\n[39]\nThe plaintiff has not proven the existence of irreparable harm.\nC. Balance of disadvantages\n\n[40]\nIn the part entitled: The balance of inconveniences, the applicant alludes to an application for permanent residence which would still be pending.\n\n[41]\nThere is nothing to demonstrate such a situation in this case.\n\n[42]\nThe plaintiff alleges that he is able to support himself and does not represent a danger to society.\n\n[43]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>, above, the Federal Court of Appeal clarified that criteria of this nature do not constitute a demonstration that the balance of convenience tilts in favor of an applicant. [21] Counsel for the appellants says that since the appellants have no criminal record, are not a security threat and are financially established and socially integrated in Canada, the balance of inconvenience favors maintaining the\nstatus quo\nuntil the outcome of their appeal. [22] I do not share this point of view. They received three adverse administrative decisions, all of which were upheld by the Federal Court. It has been almost four years since they arrived here. In my view, the balance of convenience does not militate in favor of further postponing the fulfillment of their obligation, as persons subject to an enforceable removal order, to leave Canada immediately, nor in favor of further postponing the fulfillment of the Minister's obligation to remove them as soon as circumstances permit: see subsection 48(2) of the IRPA. This is not simply a matter of administrative convenience, but rather the integrity and fairness of Canada's immigration control system, as well as public confidence in that system.\n\n[44]\nIn the absence of a serious question and irreparable harm, the balance of convenience favors the Minister who has an interest in the referral order being executed on the date he has set (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (QL)).\n\n[45]\nIndeed, subsection 48(2) of the IRPA provides:\n48.\n(1) Removal order - The removal order is enforceable since it takes effect as long as it is not subject to a stay.\n(2) Consequence - the foreign national subject to the enforceable removal order must immediately leave the territory of Canada, the measure to be applied as soon as circumstances permit.\n48.\n(1) Enforceable removal order - A removal order is enforceable if it has come into force and is not stayed.\n(2) Effect - If a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as it reasonably practicable.\nv.\nConclusion\n\n[46]\nTaking into account all of the above, the applicant does not meet the criteria of case law relating to obtaining a judicial stay.\nJUDGEMENT\n\n[47]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that\nthe request for a stay of execution is rejected.\n[End of document]",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court considered the applicant's request for a stay of removal to be a last-minute filing and, absent exceptional circumstances, found it detrimental to the respondent's ability to prepare adequately, referencing prior case law establishing this principle.",
      "The court applied the three-part test for granting a stay established in *Canada (Information Commissioner) v. Canada (Minister of National Defence)* (C.I.F.), requiring a demonstration of a serious question, irreparable harm, and a favorable balance of disadvantages; the court explicitly stated all three criteria must be met.",
      "Regarding the 'serious question' criterion, the court found the applicant failed to demonstrate one, noting the limited discretion of the removal officer to postpone removal and emphasizing that the officer is not required to reassess humanitarian factors already considered or conduct a 'mini' H&C review.",
      "The court interpreted the relevant legislation (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, art. 48) to mean that a removal officer's discretion to postpone removal is limited to special or compelling circumstances and that a pending H&C application does not automatically justify postponement.",
      "Concerning 'irreparable harm,' the court determined the applicant had not established it, as previous assessments by the Immigration and Refugee Board, the Federal Court, and the PRRA officer had already found no risk to the applicant's life or security; the court relied on precedent defining irreparable harm as a threat to life and safety, and explicitly stated family separation alone does not constitute irreparable harm.",
      "The court referenced multiple cases (*Celis*, *Simoes*, *Selliah*, etc.) to support its finding that family separation, even with children in Canada, does not meet the threshold for irreparable harm.",
      "Regarding the 'balance of disadvantages,' the court found it favored the Minister, as the applicant had not demonstrated a compelling reason to disrupt the enforcement of the removal order, and the Minister has a duty to enforce valid removal orders promptly.",
      "The court cited *Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Wang* to emphasize that the integrity of the immigration control system and public confidence in it support the timely execution of removal orders.",
      "Ultimately, the court rejected the stay application because the applicant failed to meet the requirements for all three criteria of the established test, and therefore lacked a valid basis for judicial intervention."
