    "[1]\nHarrington, J.\n: Mr. Porto Turizo, a professional engineer from Columbia, applied for permanent residence in Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker. In order to succeed, he had to meet the criteria set out in the instructions of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration published in the Canada Gazette, 28 November 2008. He submitted that he had work experience in an approved occupation, National Occupation Classification Code NOC 0711 - Construction Managers. That particular classification in the material published by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada indicates that a university degree in civil engineering or a college diploma in construction technology is usually required and some employers may also require professional engineering status. Mr. Porto Turizo met those requirements. His application was refused because the officer was not satisfied that he had performed the duties associated with the lead statement, and his employment letter did not stipulate clearly that he performed some or most of the duties under NOC 0711. This is the judicial review of that decision.",
    "[2]\nThe officer is supposed to be a specialist in these matters and, therefore, Courts, as generalists, owe deference. The decision may only be set aside if found to be unreasonable. This decision was unreasonable.",
    "[3]\nThe lead statement for NOC 0711 provides:\nConstruction managers plan, organize, direct, control and evaluate the activities of a construction company or a construction department within a company, under the direction of a general manager or other senior manager. They are employed by residential, commercial and industrial construction companies and by construction departments of companies outside the construction industry.",
    "[4]\nNOC 0711 goes on to set out the following main duties:\n Construction managers perform some or all of the following duties:\n Plan, organize, direct, control and evaluate construction projects from start to finish according to schedule, specifications and budget\n Prepare and submit construction project budget estimates\n Plan and prepare construction schedules and milestones and monitor progress against established schedules\n Prepare contracts and negotiate revisions, changes and additions to contractual agreements with architects, consultants, clients, suppliers and subcontractors\n Develop and implement quality control programs\n Represent company on matters such as business services and union contracts negotiation\n Prepare progress reports and issue progress schedules to clients\n Direct the purchase of building materials and land acquisitions\n Hire and supervise the activities of subcontractors and subordinate staff.",
    "[5]\nMr. Porto Turizo has worked for many years as a public servant for the Government of Bolivar, based in Cartagena.

      "The court undertook its own review of the record, permitted under established precedent, and determined that the submitted evidence – specifically, the employment letter detailing Mr. Porto Turizo’s duties – strongly suggested he *did* meet the criteria for the Construction Managers NOC 0711.",
      "The court performed a comparative analysis between the duties outlined in the NOC 0711 description (planning, organizing, directing, controlling, evaluating construction projects, preparing budgets, supervising staff, etc.) and the duties Mr. Porto Turizo performed for the Government of Bolivar (designing projects, evaluating feasibility, supervising works, preparing reports, etc.). The court concluded that Mr. Porto Turizo’s duties substantially aligned with those required by the NOC.",
      "The court relied on the Supreme Court’s guidance in *Communications, Energy & Paperworkers Union of Canada, Local 30 v Irving Pulp & Paper, Ltd.*, affirming that deference to administrative decision-makers ends where unreasonableness begins.",
