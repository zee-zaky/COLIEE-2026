    "[1]\nKane, J.\n: The applicant seeks judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [the\nAct\n], of a decision of a visa officer [the Officer] at the Canadian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, made on May 25, 2012, which determined that he did not meet the requirements for permanent resident status in Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker pursuant to subsections 87.3 (2) and (3) of the\nAct\n.",
    "[2]\nMr Ansari, a citizen of Iran, applied for permanent residence as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker [FSW] class, under National Occupational Classification [NOC] 0213 (Computer and Information Systems Manager).",
    "[3]\nThe Officer found that he did not provide \"sufficient evidence\" that he \"performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation, as set out in the occupational descriptions of the NOC and that [he] performed all of the essential duties and a substantial number of the main duties, as set out in the occupational descriptions of the NOC.\" The GCMS notes, which form part of the reasons, shed more light on why the Officer came to this conclusion:\nSubject has provided a letter from Iran Poust Co Ltd outlining applicants duties and responsibilities. It should be noted that letter has paraphased (sic) main duties as found in the NOC description on the website. It should also be noted that subject does not appear to have preformed (sic) some of the main duties of the NOC 0123. - I am not satisfied that subject has preformed (sic) duties of the lead statement or some of the main duties underlined in the NOC of 0213.",
    "[4]\nThe refusal letter reiterates the above and adds, the duties described in the employment letter submitted are \"closely paraphrased from occupational descriptions of the NOC, diminishing the overall credibility of the employment letter. As such I am not satisfied that you are a Computer and Information Systems Manager - 0213\".\nThe Issues",
    "[5]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer breached the duty of procedural fairness and relies on several cases that establish that where concerns related to credibility or the authenticity of documents arise there is a duty to inform an applicant of such concerns and provide an opportunity to respond:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].",
    "[6]\nThe applicant submits that an Officer's concern about paraphrasing from an NOC description is a credibility issue triggering this duty. The applicant noted jurisprudence from this Court including\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 714 [\nPatel\n] at paras 26-27;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 162;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 798 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].",
    "[7]\nThe applicant also submits that the Officer unreasonably concluded that the applicant did not perform some of the main duties of NOC 0213 given that the case law has established that the applicant need only demonstrate that one or more of the main duties are performed (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1575). The letter from the applicant's employer described two of the duties, and the FSW application lists two additional duties. The applicant further argues that the Officer failed to consider relevant evidence, including the applicant's curriculum vitae and Schedule 3, which included a list of his current duties.",
    "[8]\nThe respondent submits that there was no breach of procedural fairness. The Officer followed the process and was not required to inform the applicant of his concerns about the similarity between the job duties submitted and the language of NOC code 0213.",
    "[9]\nThe respondent points to the jurisprudence that has established that an Officer has no duty to notify applicants of concerns where they arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations and relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1782 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 26;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 587 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 9; and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above.",
    "[10]\nThe respondent submits that the Officer reasonably found that the applicant did not perform a substantial number of the duties, that the employment letter, Schedule 3 and the application all paraphrased or copied from the NOC and described only two duties, and that the employment letter did not describe the nature of the business or the lead or essential duties which the applicant must satisfy.",
    "[11]\nThe respondent also submits that visa officers need not refer to every piece of evidence submitted since there is a presumption that it has been considered:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) (QL);\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The affidavit of the Officer, which the applicant objects to, simply confirms that the Officer did consider all the documents, which is otherwise presumed.\nStandard of review",
    "[12]\nThe applicant and respondent are in agreement about the applicable standards of review. If an issue of procedural fairness arises, it is reviewable on a correctness standard:\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 434 at para 43. The Officer's decision with respect to the applicant's eligibility for permanent resident status pursuant to the FSW class requires the Officer to assess the application and exercise his discretion and is, therefore, reviewable on a reasonableness standard:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nWas there a breach of procedural fairness?",
    "[13]\nThe key issue is whether the Officer breached the duty of procedural fairness by not providing the applicant with an opportunity to address the Officer's concerns regarding the applicant's employment letter, which copied the duties set out in the NOC and led the Officer to note, \"diminishing the overall credibility of the employment letter\".",
    "[14]\nIf the concern is truly about credibility, the case law has established that a duty of procedural fairness may arise [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. However, if the concern is about the sufficiency of evidence, given that the applicant is clearly directed to provide a complete application with supporting documents, no such duty arises. Distinguishing between concerns about sufficiency of evidence and credibility is not a simple task as both issues may be related.",
    "[15]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant copied her duties directly from the NOC description. Justice Pinard determined that the Officer's decision was reasonable and that the Officer did not have a duty to inform the applicant of the duplication concerns. In addition, and as in the present case, the Officer was also not satisfied that the applicant performed the duties set out in the lead statement. Justice Pinard noted: [15] According to Operational Bulletin 120 - June 15, 2009, Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) Applications - Procedures for Visa Offices, descriptions of duties taken verbatim from the NOC are to be regarded as self-serving. When presented with such documents, visa officers are entitled to wonder whether they accurately describe the applicant's work experience. Where a document lacks sufficient detail to permit its verification and ensure a credible description, the applicant will not have produced sufficient evidence to establish eligibility: the visa officer must proceed to a final determination and if the evidence is insufficient, a negative determination of eligibility should be rendered.",
    "[16] Therefore, the officer was entitled to give less weight to the applicant's description of his work experience, being an almost exact replica of the NOC tasks. Nonetheless, the applicant claims that the officer's failure to consider the other documentary evidence he provided constitutes a reviewable error.\n[...] [20] Since the applicant's application was a virtual copy of the NOC tasks, as was his reference letter, the officer could not properly evaluate whether the applicant had the requisite work experience as a Restaurant and Food Manager, and consequently declared the applicant ineligible, in conformity with the guidelines (Operational Bulletin 120, above).\n[...] [27] In the case at hand, the officer did not have the obligation to hold an interview or to inform the applicant of his concerns with regards to the duplication of the NOC listed duties, much like in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the words of Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer at paragraph 14:\n[...] It did not help that the Applicant's own description of her duties appeared to be copied from the National Occupational Classification. Thus, it was open to the visa officer, on the basis of the scant evidence before him, to find that the Applicant had not established that she had sufficient work experience in her stated occupation, and to reject her application on that basis. [28] Therefore, the officer did not breach his duty of procedural fairness. [16]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 1624 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Boivin upheld an officer's decision not to issue a visa on the basis of credibility with respect to the employment letter. In addition to the fact that the employment letter copied the NOC duties, there were other concerns about the authenticity of the letter and the plausibility that the applicant had been hired as a Construction Project Manager with no prior training or experience.",
    "[17]\nJustice Boivin noted that\nHassani,\nwhich has been cited in many subsequent cases to support the proposition that concerns about credibility should prompt the officer to put these concerns to the applicant, does not in fact create an absolute obligation. As Justice Boivin points out, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Mosley stated: [24] [...] Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context,\nsuch a duty may arise\n. This is\noften\nthe case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern, as was the case in\nRukmangathan\n, and in\nJohn\nand\nCornea\ncited by the Court in\nRukmangathan\n, above.",
    "[18]\nJustice Boivin emphasized in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the burden is on the applicant to provide a relevant, complete and unambiguous application, as he explained at para 25: [25] As explained earlier, the burden of providing sufficient information rests on the applicant, and where the Officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the Act or its Regulations, there is no duty on the Officer to raise doubts or concerns with the applicant (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 587 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 24). Also, and contrary to the applicant's submission, there is no such absolute duty on the Officer where the application, on its face, is void of credibility. In terms of sufficient information, the onus will not shift on the Officer simply on the basis that the application is \"complete\". The applicant has the burden to put together an application that is not only \"complete\" but relevant, convincing and unambiguous (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 548; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26). Despite the distinction that the applicant attempts to make between sufficiency and authenticity, the fact of the matter is that a complete application is in fact insufficient if the information it includes is irrelevant, unconvincing or ambiguous.",
    "[19]\nThe jurisprudence also supports the position that when a concern is raised that is truly about credibility, there may be - and often will be - a duty to notify an applicant of these concerns so that the applicant may be able to provide an explanation or further documentation.",
    "[20]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice de Montigny reviewed the case law and, relying on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , found that issues of procedural fairness will arise where a visa officer's concerns relate to the credibility of evidence:\n21 It is by now well established that the duty of fairness, even if it is at the low end of the spectrum in the context of visa applications (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.) at para 39), require visa officers to inform applicants of their concerns so that an applicant may have an opportunity to disabuse an officer of such concerns. This will be the case, in particular, where such concern arises not so much from the legal requirements but from the authenticity or credibility of the evidence provided by the applicant. After having extensively reviewed the case law on this issue, Justice Mosley was able to reconcile the apparently contradictory findings of this Court in the following way:\nHaving reviewed the factual context of the cases cited above, it is clear that where a\nconcern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations\n, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns. Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context, such a duty may arise. This is often the case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern, as was the case in\nRukmangathan\n, and in\nJohn\nand\nCornea\ncited by the Court in\nRukmangathan\n, above. [emphasis added]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[21]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , no breach of procedural fairness was found because the officer had asked the applicant to provide more information or supporting material before coming to a final determination of the application.",
    "[22]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 714 is extensively relied on to support the proposition that where the NOC duties are copied, a credibility concern is raised leading to a duty to put that concern to the applicant. However, it is clear that Justice O'Keefe concluded after fully assessing the facts of that case, including that the NOC duties were copied, the reasons were not adequate, and the officer regarded the letter as fraudulent. The central issue, as stated by Justice O'Keefe, is the same issue we are faced with in the present case:\n20 The central issue in this case is whether the officer rejected the application due to concerns about the credibility of the letter of experience or because she found that the principal applicant did not produce sufficient evidence of his work experience.\n21 The case law specifies that a visa officer is not under a duty to inform an applicant about any concerns regarding the application which arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n22 However, a visa officer is obligated to inform an applicant of any concerns related to the veracity of documents and will be required to make further inquires (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 24).\n23 The onus is always on the principal applicant to satisfy the visa officer of all parts of his application. The officer is under no obligation to ask for additional information where the principal applicant's material is insufficient (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCTD) (QL) at paragraph 6).\n24 Regulation 75 clearly indicates that a foreign national is only a skilled worker if he can show one year of full time employment where he performed the actions in the lead statement of the NOC and a substantial number of the main duties.\n25 As such, if the visa officer were concerned only that the employment letter was insufficient proof that the principal applicant met the requirements of Regulation 75, then she would not have been required to conduct an interview.\n26 However, the officer states that her concern is that the duties in the employment letter have been copied directly from the NOC description and that the duties in the experience letter are identical to the letter of employment. I agree with the principal applicant that the\nofficer's reasons are inadequate to explain why this was problematic. I find that the implication from these concerns is that the officer considered the experience letter to be fraudulent.\n27 Consequently,\nby viewing the letter as fraudulent\n, the officer ought to have convoked an interview of the principal applicant based on the jurisprudence above. As such, the officer denied the principal applicant procedural fairness and the judicial review must be allowed. [Emphasis added].",
    "[23]\nIn the recent case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 284, the applicant was refused permanent resident status as a FSW, for among other reasons, copying the NOC duties. Justice Bédard extensively reviewed the applicable case law and provided a summary of the relevant principles: the onus falls on the applicant to establish that they meet the requirements of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection\nRegulations\nby providing sufficient evidence in support of their application; the duty of procedural fairness owed by visa officers is at the low end of the spectrum; there is no obligation on a visa officer to notify the applicant of the deficiencies in the application or the supporting documents; and, there is no obligation on the visa officer to provide the applicant with an opportunity to address any concerns of the officer when the supporting documents are incomplete, unclear or insufficient to satisfy the officer that the applicant meets the requirements.",
    "[24]\nJustice Bédard also noted that, as determined in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , an officer may have a duty to provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond to the officer's concerns when such concerns arise from the credibility, veracity, or authenticity of the documents rather than from the sufficiency of the evidence.",
    "[25]\nJustice Bédard noted that it is necessary to first determine if the concern is about credibility or sufficiency of evidence. She also noted that each case must be determined on its own facts: [41] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Pinard found that there was no duty on the visa officer to offer the applicant an opportunity to disabuse him of his concerns because the employment letter mirrored the duties set out in the NOC. Justice Pinard was of the view that the evidence provided by the applicant was ambiguous and insufficient. One must keep in mind that every case is fact-driven. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant had applied to be accepted in the category of Restaurant and Food Service Manager. The NOC for that position provided very generic duties and the letter of employment mirrored those generic duties. Furthermore, there was no indication in the officer's letter that his concerns were related to the veracity of the letter and the decision was limited to stating that the applicant had not provided satisfactory evidence of his work experience. In this case, the Officer was not satisfied with the employment letter because she found it to be self-serving and the job duties described mirrored the NOC description.",
    "[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 550, Justice Phelan found an officer's refusal of a FSW application to be unreasonable where the officer rejected the employment letter that closely paralleled the NOC duties. Justice Phelan noted the distinction between credibility and sufficiency and found that if the concern was in fact about credibility, the duty of procedural fairness would have been breached but if the concern related to the sufficiency of the evidence, the decision was not reasonable: [9] Firstly, a fair review of that employer's letter does not disclose the type of mindless copying of the NOC description which gives some basis for undermining the weight to be given to that evidence. The letter does not list all of the functions in the NOC description and it separates out what functions were performed in respect of two key projects. Those functions were not identical with each project. This was an unfair and unreasonable characterization. [10] Secondly, as Justice Heneghan held in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  language in reference letters similar to job descriptions in the NOC Code \"is not,\nper se\n, grounds for dismissing those reference letters\".\n[...] [15] As to the breach of procedural fairness, the Officer used the term \"credibility\" to undermine the employer's letter. If, as it appears, the Officer concluded that the letter was a fraud or misrepresentation, the Applicant would have been entitled to an opportunity to address that concern (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). If what the Officer meant is that he gave it less weight, it was an unreasonable basis to conclude lack of sufficiency of evidence.",
    "[27]\nIn the very recent case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 798, Justice Zinn dealt with a refusal letter and GCMS notes worded very similarly to those in the present case and concluded that a duty of procedural fairness was owed. Justice Zinn's conclusion was also based on finding that the applicant had otherwise provided sufficient evidence that the requirements were met: [6] The jurisprudence of this Court on procedural fairness in this area is clear: Where an applicant provides evidence sufficient to establish that they meet the requirements of the Act or regulations, as the case may be, and the officer doubts the \"credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of the information provided\" and wishes to deny the application based on those concerns, the duty of fairness is invoked:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; See also among many decisions\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[28]\nIn the present case the applicant does not dispute that the employment letter cites similarly worded duties to the NOC but submits that the application was complete and that the applicant had met the requirements for eligibility. The applicant submits that as noted by Justice O'Keefe in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1335 at para 29, \"...if an application, on its face meets all of the applicable requirements, an immigration officer would be under a duty to inform the applicant of any other consideration or concern prior to rejection\".",
    "[29]\nThe applicant submits that the issue is straightforward and the case law as clear; the Officer indicated his concern was about the credibility of the employment letter and, therefore, a duty of procedural fairness was owed.",
    "[30]\nThe case law has established that each case must be assessed to determine if the concern does in fact relate to credibility. In several of the cases referred to, although the duties were copied or paraphrased from the NOC, there were additional factors confirming that the concern of the officer was about the authenticity or veracity of the document or the credibility of the author of the document. Simply using the term credibility is not determinative of whether the concern is about credibility, though the use of the term cannot be ignored.",
    "[31]\nI agree with Justice Phelan's comment that it is not surprising that employer's letters mirror the NOC. I accept that in many cases the applicant has no better or other words to describe what his duties are and that using other descriptions runs the risk of not meeting the NOC criteria. On the other hand, an applicant should be able to describe the duties they perform in the context of their employment or the business they are engaged in and relate these to the NOC duties.",
    "[32]\nIn this case, the Officer indicated that the copying of the NOC duties diminished the credibility of the letter. In a case such as this, where all the references to the duties and experience of the applicant (the employment letter, Schedule 3 and the CV) copy or paraphrase from the NOC, the Officer is justified in being doubtful and, while he may express these as credibility concerns, he is, as a result, not able to assess whether the applicant meets the requirements because of the insufficiency of the evidence. The two issues are clearly related: if the criteria are copied, the Officer cannot be confident that the applicant actually has the experience since he cannot articulate his own experience or duties or responsibilities in his own words and in relation to the job he actually performed.",
    "[33]\nThe case law relied on by both the applicant and respondent for their respective positions is consistent in pointing to the need to determine whether the concern is about credibility or sufficiency before determining if a duty of procedural fairness is owed.",
    "[34]\nIf a concern about copying or paraphrasing from the NOC is characterized as related to credibility, without assessing whether it is in fact a credibility concern, then applicants who copy the NOC duties may come to expect an opportunity to provide further information or respond to the Officer's concerns. This will lead to delays in processing FSW applications and is inconsistent with the instructions provided to applicants to provide all the relevant documents with their applications and to visa officers to assess the application as presented.",
    "[35]\nAs noted by Justice Snider in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 910 at para 8, such a process would be akin to requiring visa officers to give advance notice of a negative decision: [8] Turning my mind to this question of a breach of procedural fairness, I note that the onus rests on the Applicant to provide adequate and sufficient evidence to support his application. A visa officer is under no duty to clarify a deficient application (see, for example,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) at para. 4). The imposition of such a requirement would be akin to requiring the visa officer to give advance notice of a negative decision, an obligation that Justice Rothstein (as he then was) expressly rejected in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL).",
    "[36]\nOn the facts of the present case, although the Officer did indicate that the copying diminished the credibility of the letter, his key findings were about the insufficient evidence. There were no other concerns noted that point to credibility. As in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the applicant's description of his duties replicated the NOC and the Officer was entitled to give the evidence less weight, and as a result, the applicant had not met the burden of providing sufficient information.",
    "[37]\nFor the reasons set out above, I find that there was no breach of procedural fairness and the Officer's decision was reasonable.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[38]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. No question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> of article 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27 (the Act), the applicant seeks judicial review of the decision rendered on May 25, 2012, by a visa officer (the Officer) of the Canadian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey. The officer decided, pursuant to subsections 87.3(2) and (3) of the Act, that the applicant did not meet the requirements for granting permanent resident status in Canada as a (federal) skilled worker."

Justice Pinard noted:\n[15] According to Operational Bulletin 120 - June 15, 2009, Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) Applications - Procedures for Visa Offices, descriptions of duties taken verbatim from the NOC are to be regarded as self-serving. When presented with such documents, visa officers are entitled to wonder whether they accurately describe the applicant's work experience. Where a document lacks sufficient detail to permit its verification and ensure a credible description, the applicant will not have produced sufficient evidence to establish eligibility: the visa officer must proceed to a final determination and if the evidence is insufficient, a negative determination of eligibility should be rendered.\n[16] Therefore, the officer was entitled to give less weight to the applicant's description of his work experience, being an almost exact replica of the NOC tasks. Nonetheless, the applicant claims that the officer's failure to consider the other documentary evidence he provided constitutes a reviewable error.\n[...]\n[20] Since the applicant's application was a virtual copy of the NOC tasks, as was his reference letter, the officer could not properly evaluate whether the applicant had the requisite work experience as a Restaurant and Food Manager, and consequently declared the applicant ineligible, in conformity with the guidelines (Operational Bulletin 120, above).\n[...]\n[27] In the case at hand, the officer did not have the obligation to hold an interview or to inform the applicant of his concerns with regards to the duplication of the NOC listed duties, much like in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the words of Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer at paragraph 14:\n[...] It did not help that the Applicant's own description of her duties appeared to be copied from the National Occupational Classification. Thus, it was open to the visa officer, on the basis of the scant evidence before him, to find that the Applicant had not established that she had sufficient work experience in her stated occupation, and to reject her application on that basis.\n[28] Therefore, the officer did not breach his duty of procedural fairness.\n[16]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 1624 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Boivin upheld an officer's decision not to issue a visa on the basis of credibility with respect to the employment letter. In addition to the fact that the employment letter copied the NOC duties, there were other concerns about the authenticity of the letter and the plausibility that the applicant had been hired as a Construction Project Manager with no prior training or experience.\n[17]\nJustice Boivin noted that\nHassani,\nwhich has been cited in many subsequent cases to support the proposition that concerns about credibility should prompt the officer to put these concerns to the applicant, does not in fact create an absolute obligation. As Justice Boivin points out, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Mosley stated:\n[24] [...] Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context,\nsuch a duty may arise\n. This is\noften\nthe case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern, as was the case in\nRukmangathan\n, and in\nJohn\nand\nCornea\ncited by the Court in\nRukmangathan\n, above.\n[18]\nJustice Boivin emphasized in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the burden is on the applicant to provide a relevant, complete and unambiguous application, as he explained at para 25:\n[25] As explained earlier, the burden of providing sufficient information rests on the applicant, and where the Officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the Act or its Regulations, there is no duty on the Officer to raise doubts or concerns with the applicant (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 587 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 24). Also, and contrary to the applicant's submission, there is no such absolute duty on the Officer where the application, on its face, is void of credibility. In terms of sufficient information, the onus will not shift on the Officer simply on the basis that the application is \"complete\". The applicant has the burden to put together an application that is not only \"complete\" but relevant, convincing and unambiguous (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 548; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26). Despite the distinction that the applicant attempts to make between sufficiency and authenticity, the fact of the matter is that a complete application is in fact insufficient if the information it includes is irrelevant, unconvincing or ambiguous.\n[19]\nThe jurisprudence also supports the position that when a concern is raised that is truly about credibility, there may be - and often will be - a duty to notify an applicant of these concerns so that the applicant may be able to provide an explanation or further documentation.\n[20]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice de Montigny reviewed the case law and, relying on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , found that issues of procedural fairness will arise where a visa officer's concerns relate to the credibility of evidence:\n21 It is by now well established that the duty of fairness, even if it is at the low end of the spectrum in the context of visa applications (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.) at para 39), require visa officers to inform applicants of their concerns so that an applicant may have an opportunity to disabuse an officer of such concerns. This will be the case, in particular, where such concern arises not so much from the legal requirements but from the authenticity or credibility of the evidence provided by the applicant. After having extensively reviewed the case law on this issue, Justice Mosley was able to reconcile the apparently contradictory findings of this Court in the following way:\nHaving reviewed the factual context of the cases cited above, it is clear that where a\nconcern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations\n, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns. Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context, such a duty may arise. This is often the case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern, as was the case in\nRukmangathan\n, and in\nJohn\nand\nCornea\ncited by the Court in\nRukmangathan\n, above. [emphasis added]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[21]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , no breach of procedural fairness was found because the officer had asked the applicant to provide more information or supporting material before coming to a final determination of the application.\n[22]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 714 is extensively relied on to support the proposition that where the NOC duties are copied, a credibility concern is raised leading to a duty to put that concern to the applicant. However, it is clear that Justice O'Keefe concluded after fully assessing the facts of that case, including that the NOC duties were copied, the reasons were not adequate, and the officer regarded the letter as fraudulent. The central issue, as stated by Justice O'Keefe, is the same issue we are faced with in the present case:\n20 The central issue in this case is whether the officer rejected the application due to concerns about the credibility of the letter of experience or because she found that the principal applicant did not produce sufficient evidence of his work experience.\n21 The case law specifies that a visa officer is not under a duty to inform an applicant about any concerns regarding the application which arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n22 However, a visa officer is obligated to inform an applicant of any concerns related to the veracity of documents and will be required to make further inquires (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 24).\n23 The onus is always on the principal applicant to satisfy the visa officer of all parts of his application. The officer is under no obligation to ask for additional information where the principal applicant's material is insufficient (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCTD) (QL) at paragraph 6).\n24 Regulation 75 clearly indicates that a foreign national is only a skilled worker if he can show one year of full time employment where he performed the actions in the lead statement of the NOC and a substantial number of the main duties.\n25 As such, if the visa officer were concerned only that the employment letter was insufficient proof that the principal applicant met the requirements of Regulation 75, then she would not have been required to conduct an interview.\n26 However, the officer states that her concern is that the duties in the employment letter have been copied directly from the NOC description and that the duties in the experience letter are identical to the letter of employment. I agree with the principal applicant that the\nofficer's reasons are inadequate to explain why this was problematic. I find that the implication from these concerns is that the officer considered the experience letter to be fraudulent.\n27 Consequently,\nby viewing the letter as fraudulent\n, the officer ought to have convoked an interview of the principal applicant based on the jurisprudence above. As such, the officer denied the principal applicant procedural fairness and the judicial review must be allowed. [Emphasis added].\n[23]\nIn the recent case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 284, the applicant was refused permanent resident status as a FSW, for among other reasons, copying the NOC duties. Justice Bédard extensively reviewed the applicable case law and provided a summary of the relevant principles: the onus falls on the applicant to establish that they meet the requirements of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection\nRegulations\nby providing sufficient evidence in support of their application; the duty of procedural fairness owed by visa officers is at the low end of the spectrum; there is no obligation on a visa officer to notify the applicant of the deficiencies in the application or the supporting documents; and, there is no obligation on the visa officer to provide the applicant with an opportunity to address any concerns of the officer when the supporting documents are incomplete, unclear or insufficient to satisfy the officer that the applicant meets the requirements.\n[24]\nJustice Bédard also noted that, as determined in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , an officer may have a duty to provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond to the officer's concerns when such concerns arise from the credibility, veracity, or authenticity of the documents rather than from the sufficiency of the evidence.\n[25]\nJustice Bédard noted that it is necessary to first determine if the concern is about credibility or sufficiency of evidence. She also noted that each case must be determined on its own facts:\n[41] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Pinard found that there was no duty on the visa officer to offer the applicant an opportunity to disabuse him of his concerns because the employment letter mirrored the duties set out in the NOC. Justice Pinard was of the view that the evidence provided by the applicant was ambiguous and insufficient. One must keep in mind that every case is fact-driven. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant had applied to be accepted in the category of Restaurant and Food Service Manager. The NOC for that position provided very generic duties and the letter of employment mirrored those generic duties. Furthermore, there was no indication in the officer's letter that his concerns were related to the veracity of the letter and the decision was limited to stating that the applicant had not provided satisfactory evidence of his work experience. In this case, the Officer was not satisfied with the employment letter because she found it to be self-serving and the job duties described mirrored the NOC description.\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 550, Justice Phelan found an officer's refusal of a FSW application to be unreasonable where the officer rejected the employment letter that closely paralleled the NOC duties. Justice Phelan noted the distinction between credibility and sufficiency and found that if the concern was in fact about credibility, the duty of procedural fairness would have been breached but if the concern related to the sufficiency of the evidence, the decision was not reasonable:\n[9] Firstly, a fair review of that employer's letter does not disclose the type of mindless copying of the NOC description which gives some basis for undermining the weight to be given to that evidence. The letter does not list all of the functions in the NOC description and it separates out what functions were performed in respect of two key projects. Those functions were not identical with each project. This was an unfair and unreasonable characterization.\n[10] Secondly, as Justice Heneghan held in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  language in reference letters similar to job descriptions in the NOC Code \"is not,\nper se\n, grounds for dismissing those reference letters\".\n[...]\n[15] As to the breach of procedural fairness, the Officer used the term \"credibility\" to undermine the employer's letter. If, as it appears, the Officer concluded that the letter was a fraud or misrepresentation, the Applicant would have been entitled to an opportunity to address that concern (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). If what the Officer meant is that he gave it less weight, it was an unreasonable basis to conclude lack of sufficiency of evidence.\n[27]\nIn the very recent case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 798, Justice Zinn dealt with a refusal letter and GCMS notes worded very similarly to those in the present case and concluded that a duty of procedural fairness was owed. Justice Zinn's conclusion was also based on finding that the applicant had otherwise provided sufficient evidence that the requirements were met:\n[6] The jurisprudence of this Court on procedural fairness in this area is clear: Where an applicant provides evidence sufficient to establish that they meet the requirements of the Act or regulations, as the case may be, and the officer doubts the \"credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of the information provided\" and wishes to deny the application based on those concerns, the duty of fairness is invoked:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; See also among many decisions\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[28]\nIn the present case the applicant does not dispute that the employment letter cites similarly worded duties to the NOC but submits that the application was complete and that the applicant had met the requirements for eligibility. The applicant submits that as noted by Justice O'Keefe in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1335 at para 29, \"...if an application, on its face meets all of the applicable requirements, an immigration officer would be under a duty to inform the applicant of any other consideration or concern prior to rejection\".\n[29]\nThe applicant submits that the issue is straightforward and the case law as clear; the Officer indicated his concern was about the credibility of the employment letter and, therefore, a duty of procedural fairness was owed.\n[30]\nThe case law has established that each case must be assessed to determine if the concern does in fact relate to credibility. In several of the cases referred to, although the duties were copied or paraphrased from the NOC, there were additional factors confirming that the concern of the officer was about the authenticity or veracity of the document or the credibility of the author of the document. Simply using the term credibility is not determinative of whether the concern is about credibility, though the use of the term cannot be ignored.\n[31]\nI agree with Justice Phelan's comment that it is not surprising that employer's letters mirror the NOC. I accept that in many cases the applicant has no better or other words to describe what his duties are and that using other descriptions runs the risk of not meeting the NOC criteria. On the other hand, an applicant should be able to describe the duties they perform in the context of their employment or the business they are engaged in and relate these to the NOC duties.\n[32]\nIn this case, the Officer indicated that the copying of the NOC duties diminished the credibility of the letter. In a case such as this, where all the references to the duties and experience of the applicant (the employment letter, Schedule 3 and the CV) copy or paraphrase from the NOC, the Officer is justified in being doubtful and, while he may express these as credibility concerns, he is, as a result, not able to assess whether the applicant meets the requirements because of the insufficiency of the evidence. The two issues are clearly related: if the criteria are copied, the Officer cannot be confident that the applicant actually has the experience since he cannot articulate his own experience or duties or responsibilities in his own words and in relation to the job he actually performed.\n[33]\nThe case law relied on by both the applicant and respondent for their respective positions is consistent in pointing to the need to determine whether the concern is about credibility or sufficiency before determining if a duty of procedural fairness is owed.\n[34]\nIf a concern about copying or paraphrasing from the NOC is characterized as related to credibility, without assessing whether it is in fact a credibility concern, then applicants who copy the NOC duties may come to expect an opportunity to provide further information or respond to the Officer's concerns. This will lead to delays in processing FSW applications and is inconsistent with the instructions provided to applicants to provide all the relevant documents with their applications and to visa officers to assess the application as presented.\n[35]\nAs noted by Justice Snider in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 910 at para 8, such a process would be akin to requiring visa officers to give advance notice of a negative decision:\n[8] Turning my mind to this question of a breach of procedural fairness, I note that the onus rests on the Applicant to provide adequate and sufficient evidence to support his application. A visa officer is under no duty to clarify a deficient application (see, for example,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) at para. 4). The imposition of such a requirement would be akin to requiring the visa officer to give advance notice of a negative decision, an obligation that Justice Rothstein (as he then was) expressly rejected in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL).\n[36]\nOn the facts of the present case, although the Officer did indicate that the copying diminished the credibility of the letter, his key findings were about the insufficient evidence. There were no other concerns noted that point to credibility. As in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the applicant's description of his duties replicated the NOC and the Officer was entitled to give the evidence less weight, and as a result, the applicant had not met the burden of providing sufficient information.\n[37]\nFor the reasons set out above, I find that there was no breach of procedural fairness and the Officer's decision was reasonable.\nJUDGMENT\n[38]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. No question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  de l'article 72 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), le demandeur sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue, le 25 mai 2012, par un agent des visas (l'agent) de l'ambassade du Canada à Ankara, en Turquie. L'agent a décidé, par application des paragraphes 87.3(2) et (3) de la Loi, que le demandeur ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences pour l'octroi du statut de résident permanent au Canada à titre de travailleur qualifié (fédéral).\n[2]\nM. Ansari, un citoyen de l'Iran, a présenté une demande de résidence permanente à titre de membre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) (TQF), sous le code 0213 (gestionnaire des systèmes informatiques) de la Classification nationale des professions (la CNP).\n[3]\nL'agent a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas fourni [traduction]  suffisamment d'éléments de preuve  qu'il [traduction]  avait exercé les fonctions décrites dans l'énoncé principal de la profession telles qu'elles sont énumérées dans la description des professions de la CNP, ni [qu'il] avait exercé toutes les fonctions essentielles ainsi qu'une partie appréciable des fonctions principales énumérées dans les descriptions des fonctions de la CNP . Les notes du Système mondial de gestion de cas (le SMGC) constituent une partie des motifs et fournissent un éclairage sur les raisons pour lesquelles l'agent est arrivé à une telle conclusion:\n[traduction]\nLe sujet a fourni une lettre d'Iran Poust Co Ltd, laquelle décrivait les fonctions et les responsabilités du demandeur. Il conviendrait de relever que la lettre paraphrasait les fonctions principales telles qu'elles sont énoncées dans la description de la CNP, sur son site Internet. Il conviendrait aussi de souligner que le sujet ne semble pas avoir exercé certaines des fonctions principales correspondant au code 0123 [sic] de la CNP. - Je ne suis pas convaincu que le sujet a exercé les fonctions de l'énoncé principal ou certaines des fonctions principales énoncées dans le code 0213 de la CNP.\n[4]\nDans la lettre de rejet, l'agent a réitéré ce qui précède et il a ajouté que les fonctions principales décrites dans la lettre d'emploi fournie sont [traduction]  reprises presque à l'identique de la description des fonctions de la CNP, ce qui affaiblit la crédibilité d'ensemble de la lettre d'emploi. Par conséquent, je ne suis pas convaincu que vous êtes un gestionnaire des systèmes informatiques, au sens du code 0213 de la CNP .\nQuestions en litige\n[5]\nLe demandeur soutient que l'agent a manqué à l'obligation d'équité procédurale et il se fonde sur plusieurs décisions établissant que, lorsqu'il y a des doutes relatifs à la crédibilité ou à l'authenticité des documents présentés, il y a une obligation d'informer le demandeur de tels doutes, et de lui donner l'occasion d'y répondre:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 17;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[6]\nSelon le demandeur, une réserve de l'agent relative à la paraphrase de la description des professions de la CNP est une question de crédibilité qui entraîne une telle obligation. Le demandeur a relevé la jurisprudence de la Cour, y compris les décisions suivantes:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 714 (\nPatel\n), aux paragraphes 26 et 27;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF no 162;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF no798 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[7]\nLe demandeur soutient aussi que l'agent a conclu de façon déraisonnable que le demandeur n'avait pas exercé certaines des fonctions principales du code 0213 de la CNP, étant donné que la jurisprudence a établi qu'il suffisait que le demandeur démontre qu'il a exercé au moins une des fonctions principales (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1575). La lettre de l'employeur du demandeur énonçait deux des fonctions, et la demande TQF énumérait deux autres fonctions. Le demandeur allègue en outre que l'agent a omis de prendre en compte la preuve pertinente en la matière, y compris le curriculum vitae du demandeur et l'annexe 3, laquelle comprenait une liste de ses fonctions actuelles.\n[8]\nLe défendeur est d'avis qu'il n'y a pas eu de manquement à l'équité procédurale. L'agent a suivi la procédure, et il n'avait pas l'obligation d'informer le demandeur de ses réserves relatives à la similitude entre les fonctions soumises et le libellé du code 0213 de la CNP.\n[9]\nLe défendeur renvoie à la jurisprudence selon laquelle un agent n'a pas l'obligation de donner au demandeur la possibilité de répondre à ses réserves lorsque celles-ci découlent directement des exigences de la Loi ou d'un règlement connexe, le défendeur se fonde sur les décisions suivantes:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1782 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 26;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 587 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 9; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée.\n[10]\nLe défendeur avance que l'agent a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas exercé un nombre important des fonctions, que la lettre d'emploi, l'annexe 3 et la demande étaient toutes des paraphrases ou des copies de la CNP et décrivaient seulement deux fonctions, et que la lettre d'emploi ne décrivait ni la nature de l'entreprise ni l'énoncé principal ni les fonctions principales, exigences auxquelles le demandeur doit satisfaire.\n[11]\nLe défendeur avance aussi que les agents des visas n'ont pas l'obligation de mentionner chacun des éléments de preuve dont ils disposaient, puisqu'il existe une présomption selon laquelle ces éléments de preuve ont été pris en compte:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) (QL);\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . L'affidavit de l'agent, auquel le demandeur s'oppose, confirme simplement que l'agent a bien tenu compte de tous les documents, affirmation qui est autrement présumée.\nNorme de contrôle\n[12]\nLe demandeur et le défendeur sont d'accord sur les normes de contrôle applicables. Si une question d'équité procédurale est soulevée, elle est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte:\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 434, au paragraphe 43. La décision de l'agent en ce qui a trait à l'admissibilité du demandeur au statut de résident permanent à titre de membre de la catégorie des TQF nécessite que l'agent apprécie la demande et qu'il exerce son pouvoir discrétionnaire et, par conséquent, elle est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nY a-t-il eu manquement à l'équité procédurale?\n[13]\nLa question principale consiste à savoir si l'agent a manqué à l'obligation d'équité procédurale, en ne donnant pas au demandeur l'occasion de répondre à ses réserves relatives à la lettre d'emploi, laquelle était une copie des fonctions énoncées dans la CNP, ce qui a conduit l'agent à faire remarquer que cela [traduction]  affaiblit la crédibilité d'ensemble de la lettre d'emploi .\n[14]\nDans le cas où la réserve porte réellement sur la crédibilité, la jurisprudence a établi qu'une obligation d'équité procédurale pouvait naître ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Toutefois, si la réserve a trait au caractère suffisant de la preuve, étant donné que le demandeur a indubitablement l'obligation de présenter une demande complète, accompagnée de documents qui l'appuient, une telle obligation n'est pas soulevée. La distinction entre les réserves relatives au caractère suffisant de la preuve et celles qui concernent la crédibilité n'est pas une tâche aisée, étant donné que les deux questions peuvent être liées.\n[15]\nDans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la demanderesse avait copié ses fonctions directement de la description de la CNP. Le juge Pinard a décidé que la décision de l'agent était raisonnable et que l'agent n'avait pas l'obligation d'informer la demanderesse de ses réserves relatives à la reproduction des fonctions énumérées. De plus, comme dans la présente espèce, l'agent n'était pas non plus convaincu que la demanderesse avait exercé les fonctions décrites dans l'énoncé principal. Le juge Pinard a relevé ce qui suit:\n[15] Selon le Bulletin opérationnel 120 -15 juin 2009, Demandes de travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) -Procédures aux bureaux des visas, les descriptions de tâches qui reproduisent littéralement la formulation de la CNP doivent être considérées comme intéressées. Les agents des visas à qui l'on soumet de tels documents ont le droit de se demander si ceux-ci décrivent avec exactitude l'expérience du demandeur. Quand un document ne comporte pas assez de précisions pour permettre sa vérification ni une description crédible, on considérera que le demandeur n'a pas produit assez de preuves pour établir son admissibilité: l'agent des visas doit rendre une décision définitive et, si les éléments de preuve sont insuffisants, c'est une décision défavorable au sujet de l'admissibilité qu'il convient de rendre.\n[16] L'agent était donc habilité à accorder moins de poids à la description que le demandeur avait faite de son expérience professionnelle, car il s'agissait d'une réplique presque exacte des fonctions énoncées dans la CNP. Le demandeur est néanmoins d'avis que le fait que l'agent n'ait pas pris en considération les autres éléments de preuve documentaires qu'il a fournis constitue une erreur susceptible de contrôle.\n[...]\n[20] Puisque la demande du demandeur était une quasi-copie des fonctions énoncées dans la CNP, tout comme l'était sa lettre de références, l'agent n'a pas pu évaluer convenablement si le demandeur possédait l'expérience professionnelle requise à titre de directeur de la restauration et des services alimentaires, et il a donc déclaré que le demandeur n'était pas admissible, conformément aux lignes directrices (Bulletin opérationnel 120, précité).\n[...]\n[27] En l'espèce, l'agent n'avait pas à tenir une entrevue ou à aviser le demandeur de ses doutes au sujet de la reproduction des fonctions énumérées dans la CNP, comme dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Comme l'a indiqué la juge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer, au paragraphe 14:\n[...] La demanderesse a semblé avoir copié la description de ses propres tâches de la Classification nationale des professions, ce qui ne l'a pas aidée. Ainsi, il était loisible à l'agent des visas, compte tenu du peu d'éléments de preuve dont il était saisi, de conclure que la demanderesse n'avait pas établi qu'elle avait une expérience professionnelle suffisante à l'égard de la profession déclarée et de rejeter sa demande pour ce motif.\n[28] L'agent n'a donc pas manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale.\n[16]\nDans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 1624 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), le juge Boivin a confirmé la décision d'un agent de ne pas délivrer de visa en raison de l'absence de crédibilité de la lettre d'emploi. En plus du fait que la lettre d'emploi était une copie des fonctions de la CNP, il y avait d'autres doutes relatifs à l'authenticité de la lettre et à la vraisemblance quant au fait que le demandeur avait été embauché comme gestionnaire de projets de construction sans aucune formation ou expérience antérieure.\n[17]\nDans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , laquelle a été citée par plusieurs décisions ultérieures à l'appui de la proposition selon laquelle les doutes relatifs à la crédibilité devraient amener l'agent à informer le demandeur de ceux-ci, le juge Boivin a noté que, dans les faits, il ne s'agit pas d'une obligation absolue. Comme le juge Boivin l'a souligné, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Mosley a déclaré ce qui suit:\n[24] [...] Lorsque, par contre, des réserves surgissent dans un autre contexte,\nune telle obligation peut exister\n. C'est\nsouvent\nle cas lorsque l'agent des visas a des doutes sur la crédibilité, l'exactitude ou l'authenticité de renseignements fournis par le demandeur au soutien de sa demande, comme dans\nRukmangathan\n, ainsi que dans\nJohn\net\nCornea\n, deux décisions citées par la Cour dans\nRukmangathan\n, précitée. [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[18]\nDans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Boivin a mis l'accent sur le fait qu'il incombe au demandeur de présenter une demande pertinente, convaincante et sans ambiguïté, ainsi qu'il l'a expliqué au paragraphe 25:\n[25] Comme il est expliqué précédemment, l'obligation de fournir des renseignements suffisants incombe au demandeur et, lorsque les préoccupations de l'agent découlent directement des exigences de la Loi ou de son règlement d'application, l'agent n'est nullement tenu de faire part de ses doutes ou de ses préoccupations au demandeur (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] ACF no 587 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 24). En outre, contrairement à ce qu'avance le demandeur, l'agent n'a aucune obligation absolue de cette nature lorsque la demande est à première vue dénuée de crédibilité. En ce qui concerne le caractère suffisant des renseignements, ce n'est pas simplement parce que la demande est  complète  que l'obligation sera transférée à l'agent. Le demandeur a l'obligation de présenter une demande qui non seulement est  complète , mais aussi pertinente, convaincante et sans ambiguïté (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 548; décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 26). Malgré la distinction que tente d'établir le demandeur entre le caractère suffisant et l'authenticité des renseignements, il n'en demeure pas moins qu'une demande complète est, en réalité, insuffisante si les renseignements qu'elle renferme sont dénués de pertinence, non probants ou ambigus.\n[19]\nLa jurisprudence permet aussi d'étayer la position selon laquelle, lorsque des doutes portant sur la crédibilité sont soulevés, il pourrait y avoir - et il y a souvent - une obligation d'informer le demandeur de ces doutes de façon à ce que le demandeur soit en mesure de fournir une explication ou d'autres documents.\n[20]\nDans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge de Montigny a analysé la jurisprudence et, se fondant sur la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a conclu que les questions d'équité procédurale seront soulevées lorsque les réserves de l'agent des visas se rapportent à la crédibilité de la preuve:\n21 Il est désormais bien établi que l'obligation d'équité dont bénéficient les demandeurs de visa, bien qu'elle se situe à l'extrémité inférieure du registre (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), impose aux agents des visas de communiquer leurs réserves aux demandeurs, de manière à ce qu'ils aient l'occasion de les dissiper. Il en sera notamment ainsi lorsque ces réserves se rapportent non pas tant à des exigences légales qu'à l'authenticité ou à la crédibilité de la preuve fournie par le demandeur. Après s'être livré à un examen approfondi de la jurisprudence sur cette question, le juge Mosley a pu concilier ainsi les décisions apparemment contradictoires la Cour:\nIl ressort clairement de l'examen du contexte factuel des décisions mentionnées ci-dessus que, lorsque les réserves découlent directement des exigences de la loi ou d'un règlement connexe, l'agent des visas n'a pas l'obligation de donner au demandeur la possibilité d'y répondre. Lorsque, par contre, des réserves surgissent dans un autre contexte, une telle obligation peut exister. C'est souvent le cas lorsque l'agent des visas a des doutes sur la crédibilité, l'exactitude ou l'authenticité de renseignements fournis par le demandeur au soutien de sa demande, comme dans\nRukmangathan\n, ainsi que dans\nJohn\net\nCornea\n, deux décisions citées par la Cour dans\nRukmangathan\n, précitée.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 24.\n[21]\nDans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , on a conclu qu'il n'y avait eu aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale, parce que l'agent avait demandé au demandeur de lui fournir plus de renseignements ou des documents à l'appui de sa demande, avant de prendre une décision définitive relativement à la demande.\n[22]\nLa décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 714, est invoquée de façon extensive à l'appui de la proposition selon laquelle, lorsqu'on copie les fonctions décrites dans la CNP, un doute relatif à la crédibilité est soulevé, ce qui conduit à l'obligation de faire part de ce doute au demandeur. Toutefois, il est clair que le juge O'Keefe a conclu, après avoir mené une appréciation complète des faits de l'affaire, y compris le fait que les fonctions de la CNP avaient été copiées, que les motifs n'étaient pas adéquats, et que l'agent avait considéré que la lettre était frauduleuse. La question centrale, telle que l'a énoncée le juge O'Keefe, est la même que la question à laquelle nous sommes exposés dans la présente affaire:\n[20] La question centrale qui se pose en l'espèce est de savoir si l'agente a rejeté la demande parce qu'elle avait des préoccupations au sujet de la crédibilité de la lettre concernant l'expérience professionnelle ou parce qu'elle a conclu que le demandeur principal n'avait pas produit suffisamment d'éléments de preuve sur son expérience de travail.\n[21] Il appert de la jurisprudence que l'agent des visas n'est pas tenu d'informer le demandeur des réserves qu'il a au sujet de la demande lorsque ces réserves découlent directement des exigences de la législation ou des règlements (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 24).\n[22] Cependant, l'agent des visas est tenu d'informer le demandeur de ses réserves concernant la véracité des documents et devra faire des recherches plus approfondies (voir la décision\nHassani,\nprécitée, au paragraphe 24).\n[23] Il appartient toujours au demandeur principal d'établir le bien-fondé de tous les aspects de sa demande auprès de l'agent des visas. L'agent n'est pas tenu de demander des renseignements supplémentaires lorsque la preuve du demandeur principal est insuffisante (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1reinst.) (QL), au paragraphe 6).\n[24] Il appert clairement de l'article 75 du Règlement que l'étranger est un travailleur qualifié uniquement s'il peut prouver qu'il a accumulé au moins une année d'expérience à temps plein au cours de laquelle il a accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi dans la description de la CNP et une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de cette même profession.\n[25] En conséquence, si l'agente des visas avait craint uniquement que la lettre concernant l'expérience professionnelle ne constitue pas une preuve suffisante du fait que le demandeur principal respectait les exigences de l'article 75 du Règlement, elle n'aurait pas été tenue de le convoquer à une entrevue.\n[26] Cependant, l'agente souligne que, selon elle, les fonctions énoncées dans la lettre d'emploi ont été copiées directement de la description de la CNP et que les fonctions mentionnées dans la lettre concernant l'expérience professionnelle sont identiques à celles qui figurent dans la lettre d'emploi. Je conviens avec le demandeur principal que\nl'agente n'a pas donné suffisamment d'explications permettant de comprendre pourquoi cet aspect était problématique. À mon avis, ces préoccupations donnent à entendre que l'agente croyait que la lettre concernant l'expérience professionnelle était frauduleuse\n.\n[27] En conséquence,\nétant donné qu'elle estimait que la lettre était frauduleuse\n, l'agente aurait dû convoquer le demandeur principal à une entrevue, eu égard à la jurisprudence susmentionnée. En omettant de le faire, l'agente a privé le demandeur principal du droit à l'équité procédurale et la demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être accueillie. [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[23]\nDans la récente décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF no 284, le demandeur s'est vu refuser le statut de résident permanent à titre de membre de la catégorie des TQF, parce qu'il avait, entre autres, copié les fonctions de la CNP. La juge Bédard a examiné en profondeur la jurisprudence applicable et a fait un résumé des principes pertinents quant à la question: il incombe au demandeur de démontrer qu'il satisfait aux exigences du\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\nen présentant des éléments de preuve suffisants à l'appui de sa demande; l'obligation d'équité procédurale à laquelle sont astreints les agents des visas se situe à l'extrémité inférieure du registre; l'agent des visas n'est pas tenu d'informer le demandeur des lacunes de sa demande ou des documents à l'appui; l'agent des visas n'a aucune obligation de donner au demandeur l'occasion de dissiper ses doutes, lorsque les documents à l'appui sont incomplets, imprécis ou insuffisants pour le convaincre que le demandeur répond aux critères.\n[24]\nLa juge Bédard a aussi relevé, comme cela avait été décidé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , qu'un agent peut avoir l'obligation de fournir au demandeur l'occasion de répondre à ses réserves lorsqu'elles sont liées à la crédibilité, la véracité ou l'authenticité des documents plutôt qu'au caractère suffisant de la preuve.\n[25]\nLa juge Bédard a noté qu'il est nécessaire de déterminer, en premier lieu, si les réserves de l'agent sont liées à la crédibilité ou au caractère suffisant de la preuve. Elle a aussi souligné que chaque cas doit être tranché en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres:\n[41] Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, le juge Pinard a conclu que l'agent des visas n'était pas tenu d'inviter le demandeur à dissiper les doutes qu'il avait parce que la lettre d'emploi reflétait les fonctions énoncées dans la CNP. Le juge Pinard estimait que les éléments de preuve fournis par le demandeur étaient ambigus et insuffisants. Il faut garder à l'esprit que chaque cas est tributaire des faits. Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le demandeur avait présenté une demande dans la catégorie d'emploi  directeurs / directrices de la restauration et des services alimentaires . La description de la CNP correspondant à ce poste énumérait des fonctions très générales qui étaient reprises dans la lettre d'emploi. En outre, la lettre de l'agent ne renfermait aucune indication voulant que ses préoccupations soient liées à la véracité de la lettre; la décision expliquait simplement que le demandeur n'avait pas fourni d'éléments de preuve suffisants de son expérience professionnelle. En l'espèce, l'agente n'a pas estimé satisfaisante la lettre d'emploi parce qu'il s'agissait, à ses yeux, d'une lettre intéressée et les fonctions qui y étaient décrites reprenaient la description de la CNP.\n[26]\nDans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ACF no 550, le juge Phelan a conclu que la décision de l'agent était déraisonnable, parce que celui-ci avait rejeté une demande TQF au motif que la lettre d'emploi était étroitement parallèle aux fonctions décrites dans la CNP. Le juge Phelan a souligné la distinction entre la crédibilité et le caractère suffisant, et il a conclu que, si la réserve portait en réalité sur la crédibilité, il y aurait eu manquement à l'obligation d'équité procédurale, mais si la réserve avait trait au caractère suffisant de la preuve, la décision n'était pas raisonnable:\n[9] Premièrement, l'on constate, après examen impartial de la lettre de l'employeur, qu'il ne s'agit pas du genre de reprise servile de descriptions de la CNP justifiant d'attribuer un poids moindre à cet élément de preuve. La lettre n'énumère pas toutes les fonctions figurant dans la description de la CNP, et elle distingue entre les fonctions accomplies à l'égard de deux projets importants, lesquelles ne sont pas les mêmes dans les deux projets. L'analyse de l'agent était injuste et déraisonnable.\n[10] Deuxièmement, comme la juge Heneghan l'a indiqué dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'emploi dans des lettres de recommandation de formulations analogues à celles de descriptions de tâches de la CNP [traduction]  ne justifie pas en soi d'écarter ces lettres .\n[...]\n[15] Pour ce qui est du manquement à l'équité procédurale, l'agent a employé le mot [traduction]  crédibilité  pour discréditer la lettre de l'employeur. Si l'agent a conclu, comme cela semble être le cas, que la lettre était fausse ou trompeuse, le demandeur aurait dû avoir l'occasion de dissiper cette impression (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Si l'agent a voulu dire par là qu'il a accordé moins de poids à la lettre, cette conclusion que la preuve était insuffisante était mal fondée.\n[27]\nDans la récente décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF no 798, le juge Zinn a examiné une lettre de refus et des notes du SMGC formulées de façon très semblable à celles de la présente espèce et il a conclu qu'une obligation d'équité procédurale était requise. La décision du juge Zinn était aussi fondée sur la conclusion que le demandeur avait par ailleurs fourni des éléments de preuve suffisants pour établir qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences:\n[6] La jurisprudence de la Cour en matière d'équité procédurale dans ce domaine est claire: lorsqu'un demandeur fournit des preuves suffisantes pour établir qu'il satisfait aux exigences de la Loi ou du Règlement, le cas échéant, et que l'agent met en doute  la crédibilité, l'exactitude ou l'authenticité des renseignements fournis  et qu'il souhaite rejeter la demande en fonction de ces doutes, l'obligation d'équité est invoquée:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Voir aussi, entre autres,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[28]\nDans la présente espèce, le demandeur ne conteste pas que la lettre d'emploi contient des fonctions énoncées de façon similaire à celles de la CNP, mais il soutient que sa demande était complète et qu'il avait satisfait aux exigences relatives à l'admissibilité. Le demandeur avance que, comme le juge O'Keefe l'a relevé au paragraphe 29 de la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1335,  [...] lorsqu'une demande satisfait à première vue à toutes les exigences applicables, un agent d'immigration est tenu d'informer le demandeur de toute autre question ou préoccupation avant de la rejeter .\n[29]\nLe demandeur avance que la question est simple et la jurisprudence claire; l'agent a indiqué que sa réserve était liée à la crédibilité de la lettre d'emploi et, par conséquent, il était tenu à une obligation d'équité procédurale.\n[30]\nLa jurisprudence a établi que chaque cas doit être apprécié pour déterminer si la réserve est en fait liée à la crédibilité. Dans plusieurs décisions citées, malgré le fait que les fonctions avaient été copiées ou paraphrasées de la CNP, il y avait d'autres facteurs confirmant que les réserves de l'agent étaient liées à l'authenticité ou à la véracité des documents, ou à la crédibilité de l'auteur du document. Le simple fait d'utiliser le terme crédibilité n'est pas déterminant de la question de savoir si la réserve a trait à la crédibilité, bien que l'utilisation de ce terme ne puisse pas être écartée.\n[31]\nJe souscris au commentaire du juge Phelan selon lequel on ne peut guère se surprendre que les lettres des employeurs ressemblent étroitement à la CNP. J'admets que, dans beaucoup de cas, le demandeur n'a ni d'autres mots ni de mots mieux choisis pour décrire ses fonctions et que le fait d'utiliser d'autres descriptions entraîne pour lui le risque de ne pas satisfaire aux critères de la CNP. Par ailleurs, un demandeur devrait être en mesure de décrire les fonctions qu'il a exercées dans le contexte de son emploi ou de l'entreprise dans laquelle il était engagé et relier ces fonctions à celles de la CNP.\n[32]\nEn l'espèce, l'agent a indiqué que le fait de copier les fonctions de la CNP affaiblissait la crédibilité de la lettre. Dans un cas comme celui de la présente espèce, lorsque toutes les références aux fonctions et à l'expérience du demandeur (la lettre d'emploi, l'annexe 3 et le CV) copient ou paraphrasent la CNP, les doutes de l'agent sont justifiés, et, bien que celui-ci puisse dire qu'il s'agit de doutes relatifs à la crédibilité, l'agent n'est pas, en conséquence, en mesure d'apprécier si le demandeur satisfait aux exigences en raison de l'insuffisance de la preuve. Il est clair que les deux questions sont reliées: si les critères sont copiés, l'agent ne peut pas être sûr que le demandeur a effectivement l'expérience requise, étant donné qu'il ne peut pas formuler, dans ses propres mots, son expérience, ses fonctions ou ses responsabilités, et qu'il ne peut pas les relier à l'emploi qu'il a effectivement exercé.\n[33]\nLa jurisprudence citée à la fois par le demandeur et par le défendeur à l'appui de leur position respective est cohérente en ce sens qu'elle oriente vers la nécessité de déterminer si les réserves tiennent à la crédibilité ou bien au caractère suffisant, avant de trancher la question de savoir si une obligation d'équité procédurale existe.\n[34]\nSi une réserve relative au fait de copier ou de paraphraser la CNP est qualifiée comme étant liée à la crédibilité, sans examen de la question de savoir s'il s'agit en fait d'une réserve portant sur la crédibilité, alors les demandeurs qui copient les fonctions de la CNP peuvent s'attendre à ce qu'on leur donne une occasion de fournir d'autres renseignements ou de répondre aux réserves de l'agent. Cela entraînera des retards dans le traitement des demandes TQF, et ce n'est pas compatible avec les directives données aux demandeurs, selon lesquelles ils doivent fournir tous les documents pertinents avec leur demande, et celles données aux agents des visas de traiter les demandes telles qu'elles leurs sont soumises.\n[35]\nComme la juge Snider l'a souligné au paragraphe 8 de la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 910, un tel processus équivaudrait à exiger de la part de l'agent de donner préavis d'une décision défavorable:\n[8] S'agissant de la question du manquement aux principes d'équité procédurale, je souligne qu'il incombe au demandeur de fournir des éléments de preuve adéquats et suffisants pour appuyer sa demande. Un agent des visas n'est nullement tenu de clarifier une demande incomplète (voir, par exemple,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.) au paragraphe 4). L'imposition d'une telle exigence équivaudrait à exiger de la part de l'agent des visas de donner préavis d'une décision défavorable, une obligation que le juge Rothstein (tel était alors son titre) a expressément rejetée dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL).\n[36]\nSelon les faits de la présente espèce, bien que l'agent des visas ait indiqué que le fait de copier affaiblissait la crédibilité de la lettre, ses conclusions principales portaient sur le caractère suffisant de la preuve. Il n'y avait pas d'autres doutes relevés orientant vers la crédibilité. Comme dans les décisions <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la description faite par le demandeur de ses fonctions était une reproduction de la description de la CNP, l'agent avait le droit d'accorder moins de poids à la preuve et, par conséquent, le demandeur n'avait pas satisfait à l'obligation de fournir suffisamment de renseignements.\n[37]\nPour les motifs énoncés ci-dessus, je conclus qu'il n'y avait pas de manquement à l'équité procédurale et que la décision de l'agent était raisonnable.\nJUGEMENT\n[38]\nLA COUR STATUE que\n:\n1.

Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nKane, J.\n: The applicant seeks judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [the\nAct\n], of a decision of a visa officer [the Officer] at the Canadian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, made on May 25, 2012, which determined that he did not meet the requirements for permanent resident status in Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker pursuant to subsections 87.3 (2) and (3) of the\nAct\n.\n\n[2]\nMr Ansari, a citizen of Iran, applied for permanent residence as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker [FSW] class, under National Occupational Classification [NOC] 0213 (Computer and Information Systems Manager).\n\n[3]\nThe Officer found that he did not provide \"sufficient evidence\" that he \"performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation, as set out in the occupational descriptions of the NOC and that [he] performed all of the essential duties and a substantial number of the main duties, as set out in the occupational descriptions of the NOC.\" The GCMS notes, which form part of the reasons, shed more light on why the Officer came to this conclusion:\nSubject has provided a letter from Iran Poust Co Ltd outlining applicants duties and responsibilities. It should be noted that letter has paraphased (sic) main duties as found in the NOC description on the website. It should also be noted that subject does not appear to have preformed (sic) some of the main duties of the NOC 0123. - I am not satisfied that subject has preformed (sic) duties of the lead statement or some of the main duties underlined in the NOC of 0213.\n\n[4]\nThe refusal letter reiterates the above and adds, the duties described in the employment letter submitted are \"closely paraphrased from occupational descriptions of the NOC, diminishing the overall credibility of the employment letter. As such I am not satisfied that you are a Computer and Information Systems Manager - 0213\".\nThe Issues\n\n[5]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer breached the duty of procedural fairness and relies on several cases that establish that where concerns related to credibility or the authenticity of documents arise there is a duty to inform an applicant of such concerns and provide an opportunity to respond:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n\n[6]\nThe applicant submits that an Officer's concern about paraphrasing from an NOC description is a credibility issue triggering this duty. The applicant noted jurisprudence from this Court including\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 714 [\nPatel\n] at paras 26-27;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 162;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 798 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n\n[7]\nThe applicant also submits that the Officer unreasonably concluded that the applicant did not perform some of the main duties of NOC 0213 given that the case law has established that the applicant need only demonstrate that one or more of the main duties are performed (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1575). The letter from the applicant's employer described two of the duties, and the FSW application lists two additional duties. The applicant further argues that the Officer failed to consider relevant evidence, including the applicant's curriculum vitae and Schedule 3, which included a list of his current duties.\n\n[8]\nThe respondent submits that there was no breach of procedural fairness. The Officer followed the process and was not required to inform the applicant of his concerns about the similarity between the job duties submitted and the language of NOC code 0213.\n\n[9]\nThe respondent points to the jurisprudence that has established that an Officer has no duty to notify applicants of concerns where they arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations and relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1782 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 26;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 587 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 9; and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above.\n\n[10]\nThe respondent submits that the Officer reasonably found that the applicant did not perform a substantial number of the duties, that the employment letter, Schedule 3 and the application all paraphrased or copied from the NOC and described only two duties, and that the employment letter did not describe the nature of the business or the lead or essential duties which the applicant must satisfy.\n\n[11]\nThe respondent also submits that visa officers need not refer to every piece of evidence submitted since there is a presumption that it has been considered:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) (QL);\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The affidavit of the Officer, which the applicant objects to, simply confirms that the Officer did consider all the documents, which is otherwise presumed.\nStandard of review\n\n[12]\nThe applicant and respondent are in agreement about the applicable standards of review. If an issue of procedural fairness arises, it is reviewable on a correctness standard:\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 434 at para 43. The Officer's decision with respect to the applicant's eligibility for permanent resident status pursuant to the FSW class requires the Officer to assess the application and exercise his discretion and is, therefore, reviewable on a reasonableness standard:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nWas there a breach of procedural fairness?\n\n[13]\nThe key issue is whether the Officer breached the duty of procedural fairness by not providing the applicant with an opportunity to address the Officer's concerns regarding the applicant's employment letter, which copied the duties set out in the NOC and led the Officer to note, \"diminishing the overall credibility of the employment letter\".\n\n[14]\nIf the concern is truly about credibility, the case law has established that a duty of procedural fairness may arise [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. However, if the concern is about the sufficiency of evidence, given that the applicant is clearly directed to provide a complete application with supporting documents, no such duty arises. Distinguishing between concerns about sufficiency of evidence and credibility is not a simple task as both issues may be related.\n\n[15]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant copied her duties directly from the NOC description. Justice Pinard determined that the Officer's decision was reasonable and that the Officer did not have a duty to inform the applicant of the duplication concerns. In addition, and as in the present case, the Officer was also not satisfied that the applicant performed the duties set out in the lead statement. Justice Pinard noted: [15] According to Operational Bulletin 120 - June 15, 2009, Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) Applications - Procedures for Visa Offices, descriptions of duties taken verbatim from the NOC are to be regarded as self-serving. When presented with such documents, visa officers are entitled to wonder whether they accurately describe the applicant's work experience. Where a document lacks sufficient detail to permit its verification and ensure a credible description, the applicant will not have produced sufficient evidence to establish eligibility: the visa officer must proceed to a final determination and if the evidence is insufficient, a negative determination of eligibility should be rendered.\n\n[16] Therefore, the officer was entitled to give less weight to the applicant's description of his work experience, being an almost exact replica of the NOC tasks. Nonetheless, the applicant claims that the officer's failure to consider the other documentary evidence he provided constitutes a reviewable error.\n[...] [20] Since the applicant's application was a virtual copy of the NOC tasks, as was his reference letter, the officer could not properly evaluate whether the applicant had the requisite work experience as a Restaurant and Food Manager, and consequently declared the applicant ineligible, in conformity with the guidelines (Operational Bulletin 120, above).\n[...] [27] In the case at hand, the officer did not have the obligation to hold an interview or to inform the applicant of his concerns with regards to the duplication of the NOC listed duties, much like in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the words of Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer at paragraph 14:\n[...] It did not help that the Applicant's own description of her duties appeared to be copied from the National Occupational Classification. Thus, it was open to the visa officer, on the basis of the scant evidence before him, to find that the Applicant had not established that she had sufficient work experience in her stated occupation, and to reject her application on that basis. [28] Therefore, the officer did not breach his duty of procedural fairness. [16]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 1624 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Boivin upheld an officer's decision not to issue a visa on the basis of credibility with respect to the employment letter. In addition to the fact that the employment letter copied the NOC duties, there were other concerns about the authenticity of the letter and the plausibility that the applicant had been hired as a Construction Project Manager with no prior training or experience.\n\n[17]\nJustice Boivin noted that\nHassani,\nwhich has been cited in many subsequent cases to support the proposition that concerns about credibility should prompt the officer to put these concerns to the applicant, does not in fact create an absolute obligation. As Justice Boivin points out, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Mosley stated: [24] [...] Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context,\nsuch a duty may arise\n. This is\noften\nthe case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern, as was the case in\nRukmangathan\n, and in\nJohn\nand\nCornea\ncited by the Court in\nRukmangathan\n, above.\n\n[18]\nJustice Boivin emphasized in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the burden is on the applicant to provide a relevant, complete and unambiguous application, as he explained at para 25: [25] As explained earlier, the burden of providing sufficient information rests on the applicant, and where the Officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the Act or its Regulations, there is no duty on the Officer to raise doubts or concerns with the applicant (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 587 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 24). Also, and contrary to the applicant's submission, there is no such absolute duty on the Officer where the application, on its face, is void of credibility. In terms of sufficient information, the onus will not shift on the Officer simply on the basis that the application is \"complete\". The applicant has the burden to put together an application that is not only \"complete\" but relevant, convincing and unambiguous (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 548; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26). Despite the distinction that the applicant attempts to make between sufficiency and authenticity, the fact of the matter is that a complete application is in fact insufficient if the information it includes is irrelevant, unconvincing or ambiguous.\n\n[19]\nThe jurisprudence also supports the position that when a concern is raised that is truly about credibility, there may be - and often will be - a duty to notify an applicant of these concerns so that the applicant may be able to provide an explanation or further documentation.\n\n[20]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice de Montigny reviewed the case law and, relying on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , found that issues of procedural fairness will arise where a visa officer's concerns relate to the credibility of evidence:\n21 It is by now well established that the duty of fairness, even if it is at the low end of the spectrum in the context of visa applications (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.) at para 39), require visa officers to inform applicants of their concerns so that an applicant may have an opportunity to disabuse an officer of such concerns. This will be the case, in particular, where such concern arises not so much from the legal requirements but from the authenticity or credibility of the evidence provided by the applicant. After having extensively reviewed the case law on this issue, Justice Mosley was able to reconcile the apparently contradictory findings of this Court in the following way:\nHaving reviewed the factual context of the cases cited above, it is clear that where a\nconcern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations\n, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns. Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context, such a duty may arise. This is often the case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern, as was the case in\nRukmangathan\n, and in\nJohn\nand\nCornea\ncited by the Court in\nRukmangathan\n, above. [emphasis added]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[21]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , no breach of procedural fairness was found because the officer had asked the applicant to provide more information or supporting material before coming to a final determination of the application.\n\n[22]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 714 is extensively relied on to support the proposition that where the NOC duties are copied, a credibility concern is raised leading to a duty to put that concern to the applicant. However, it is clear that Justice O'Keefe concluded after fully assessing the facts of that case, including that the NOC duties were copied, the reasons were not adequate, and the officer regarded the letter as fraudulent. The central issue, as stated by Justice O'Keefe, is the same issue we are faced with in the present case:\n20 The central issue in this case is whether the officer rejected the application due to concerns about the credibility of the letter of experience or because she found that the principal applicant did not produce sufficient evidence of his work experience.\n21 The case law specifies that a visa officer is not under a duty to inform an applicant about any concerns regarding the application which arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n22 However, a visa officer is obligated to inform an applicant of any concerns related to the veracity of documents and will be required to make further inquires (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 24).\n23 The onus is always on the principal applicant to satisfy the visa officer of all parts of his application. The officer is under no obligation to ask for additional information where the principal applicant's material is insufficient (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCTD) (QL) at paragraph 6).\n24 Regulation 75 clearly indicates that a foreign national is only a skilled worker if he can show one year of full time employment where he performed the actions in the lead statement of the NOC and a substantial number of the main duties.\n25 As such, if the visa officer were concerned only that the employment letter was insufficient proof that the principal applicant met the requirements of Regulation 75, then she would not have been required to conduct an interview.\n26 However, the officer states that her concern is that the duties in the employment letter have been copied directly from the NOC description and that the duties in the experience letter are identical to the letter of employment. I agree with the principal applicant that the\nofficer's reasons are inadequate to explain why this was problematic. I find that the implication from these concerns is that the officer considered the experience letter to be fraudulent.\n27 Consequently,\nby viewing the letter as fraudulent\n, the officer ought to have convoked an interview of the principal applicant based on the jurisprudence above. As such, the officer denied the principal applicant procedural fairness and the judicial review must be allowed. [Emphasis added].\n\n[23]\nIn the recent case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 284, the applicant was refused permanent resident status as a FSW, for among other reasons, copying the NOC duties. Justice Bédard extensively reviewed the applicable case law and provided a summary of the relevant principles: the onus falls on the applicant to establish that they meet the requirements of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection\nRegulations\nby providing sufficient evidence in support of their application; the duty of procedural fairness owed by visa officers is at the low end of the spectrum; there is no obligation on a visa officer to notify the applicant of the deficiencies in the application or the supporting documents; and, there is no obligation on the visa officer to provide the applicant with an opportunity to address any concerns of the officer when the supporting documents are incomplete, unclear or insufficient to satisfy the officer that the applicant meets the requirements.\n\n[24]\nJustice Bédard also noted that, as determined in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , an officer may have a duty to provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond to the officer's concerns when such concerns arise from the credibility, veracity, or authenticity of the documents rather than from the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\n[25]\nJustice Bédard noted that it is necessary to first determine if the concern is about credibility or sufficiency of evidence. She also noted that each case must be determined on its own facts: [41] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Pinard found that there was no duty on the visa officer to offer the applicant an opportunity to disabuse him of his concerns because the employment letter mirrored the duties set out in the NOC. Justice Pinard was of the view that the evidence provided by the applicant was ambiguous and insufficient. One must keep in mind that every case is fact-driven. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant had applied to be accepted in the category of Restaurant and Food Service Manager. The NOC for that position provided very generic duties and the letter of employment mirrored those generic duties. Furthermore, there was no indication in the officer's letter that his concerns were related to the veracity of the letter and the decision was limited to stating that the applicant had not provided satisfactory evidence of his work experience. In this case, the Officer was not satisfied with the employment letter because she found it to be self-serving and the job duties described mirrored the NOC description.\n\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 550, Justice Phelan found an officer's refusal of a FSW application to be unreasonable where the officer rejected the employment letter that closely paralleled the NOC duties. Justice Phelan noted the distinction between credibility and sufficiency and found that if the concern was in fact about credibility, the duty of procedural fairness would have been breached but if the concern related to the sufficiency of the evidence, the decision was not reasonable: [9] Firstly, a fair review of that employer's letter does not disclose the type of mindless copying of the NOC description which gives some basis for undermining the weight to be given to that evidence. The letter does not list all of the functions in the NOC description and it separates out what functions were performed in respect of two key projects. Those functions were not identical with each project. This was an unfair and unreasonable characterization. [10] Secondly, as Justice Heneghan held in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  language in reference letters similar to job descriptions in the NOC Code \"is not,\nper se\n, grounds for dismissing those reference letters\".\n[...] [15] As to the breach of procedural fairness, the Officer used the term \"credibility\" to undermine the employer's letter. If, as it appears, the Officer concluded that the letter was a fraud or misrepresentation, the Applicant would have been entitled to an opportunity to address that concern (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). If what the Officer meant is that he gave it less weight, it was an unreasonable basis to conclude lack of sufficiency of evidence.\n\n[27]\nIn the very recent case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 798, Justice Zinn dealt with a refusal letter and GCMS notes worded very similarly to those in the present case and concluded that a duty of procedural fairness was owed. Justice Zinn's conclusion was also based on finding that the applicant had otherwise provided sufficient evidence that the requirements were met: [6] The jurisprudence of this Court on procedural fairness in this area is clear: Where an applicant provides evidence sufficient to establish that they meet the requirements of the Act or regulations, as the case may be, and the officer doubts the \"credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of the information provided\" and wishes to deny the application based on those concerns, the duty of fairness is invoked:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; See also among many decisions\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[28]\nIn the present case the applicant does not dispute that the employment letter cites similarly worded duties to the NOC but submits that the application was complete and that the applicant had met the requirements for eligibility. The applicant submits that as noted by Justice O'Keefe in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1335 at para 29, \"...if an application, on its face meets all of the applicable requirements, an immigration officer would be under a duty to inform the applicant of any other consideration or concern prior to rejection\".\n\n[29]\nThe applicant submits that the issue is straightforward and the case law as clear; the Officer indicated his concern was about the credibility of the employment letter and, therefore, a duty of procedural fairness was owed.\n\n[30]\nThe case law has established that each case must be assessed to determine if the concern does in fact relate to credibility. In several of the cases referred to, although the duties were copied or paraphrased from the NOC, there were additional factors confirming that the concern of the officer was about the authenticity or veracity of the document or the credibility of the author of the document. Simply using the term credibility is not determinative of whether the concern is about credibility, though the use of the term cannot be ignored.\n\n[31]\nI agree with Justice Phelan's comment that it is not surprising that employer's letters mirror the NOC. I accept that in many cases the applicant has no better or other words to describe what his duties are and that using other descriptions runs the risk of not meeting the NOC criteria. On the other hand, an applicant should be able to describe the duties they perform in the context of their employment or the business they are engaged in and relate these to the NOC duties.\n\n[32]\nIn this case, the Officer indicated that the copying of the NOC duties diminished the credibility of the letter. In a case such as this, where all the references to the duties and experience of the applicant (the employment letter, Schedule 3 and the CV) copy or paraphrase from the NOC, the Officer is justified in being doubtful and, while he may express these as credibility concerns, he is, as a result, not able to assess whether the applicant meets the requirements because of the insufficiency of the evidence. The two issues are clearly related: if the criteria are copied, the Officer cannot be confident that the applicant actually has the experience since he cannot articulate his own experience or duties or responsibilities in his own words and in relation to the job he actually performed.\n\n[33]\nThe case law relied on by both the applicant and respondent for their respective positions is consistent in pointing to the need to determine whether the concern is about credibility or sufficiency before determining if a duty of procedural fairness is owed.\n\n[34]\nIf a concern about copying or paraphrasing from the NOC is characterized as related to credibility, without assessing whether it is in fact a credibility concern, then applicants who copy the NOC duties may come to expect an opportunity to provide further information or respond to the Officer's concerns. This will lead to delays in processing FSW applications and is inconsistent with the instructions provided to applicants to provide all the relevant documents with their applications and to visa officers to assess the application as presented.\n\n[35]\nAs noted by Justice Snider in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 910 at para 8, such a process would be akin to requiring visa officers to give advance notice of a negative decision: [8] Turning my mind to this question of a breach of procedural fairness, I note that the onus rests on the Applicant to provide adequate and sufficient evidence to support his application. A visa officer is under no duty to clarify a deficient application (see, for example,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) at para. 4). The imposition of such a requirement would be akin to requiring the visa officer to give advance notice of a negative decision, an obligation that Justice Rothstein (as he then was) expressly rejected in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL).\n\n[36]\nOn the facts of the present case, although the Officer did indicate that the copying diminished the credibility of the letter, his key findings were about the insufficient evidence. There were no other concerns noted that point to credibility. As in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the applicant's description of his duties replicated the NOC and the Officer was entitled to give the evidence less weight, and as a result, the applicant had not met the burden of providing sufficient information.\n\n[37]\nFor the reasons set out above, I find that there was no breach of procedural fairness and the Officer's decision was reasonable.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[38]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. No question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> of article 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27 (the Act), the applicant seeks judicial review of the decision rendered on May 25, 2012, by a visa officer (the Officer) of the Canadian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey.

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether the visa officer breached procedural fairness by not informing the applicant of concerns regarding his employment letter, which closely mirrored the duties outlined in the National Occupational Classification (NOC).",

      "The court relied on precedent, including *Patel*, *Hassani*, and *Rukmangathan*, to establish that while concerns about credibility trigger a duty to inform and allow a response, concerns about sufficiency of evidence do not, as applicants are expected to submit complete and accurate applications.",
      "The court found that Operational Bulletin 120 directs visa officers to view verbatim copying of NOC duties as self-serving and potentially lacking credibility, justifying the officer's skepticism.",
      "The court determined that the officer's concern, while expressed using the term 'credibility,' was fundamentally about the *insufficiency* of the evidence to demonstrate the applicant's actual work experience, as the copied duties prevented assessment of whether the applicant possessed the required skills.",
      "The court emphasized that requiring officers to address every instance of NOC duty copying would create delays and contradict the expectation that applicants submit complete applications, aligning with the reasoning in *Snider*.",
      "The court found the officer's decision reasonable, concluding that no breach of procedural fairness occurred because the officer was justified in giving less weight to the evidence due to the replicated duties and the applicant failed to meet the burden of proving sufficient work experience.",
      "The court acknowledged that each case is fact-specific, but in this instance, the lack of other credibility concerns reinforced the conclusion that the issue was one of evidentiary sufficiency."
