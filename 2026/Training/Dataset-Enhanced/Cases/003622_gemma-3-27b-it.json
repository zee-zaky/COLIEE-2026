    "[0]\nI.\nIntroduction",
    "[1]\nShore, J.\n: This is an application for leave and judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of a decision wherein the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] upheld the Refugee Protection Board's [RPD] findings, thus rejecting the Applicant's claim for refugee protection.\nII.\nBackground",
    "[2]\nThe Applicant is a homosexual man who allegedly fears persecution in his country of citizenship, Algeria, by reason of his sexual orientation. It is upon this basis that the Applicant seeks refugee status in Canada. The Applicant alleges the following facts.",
    "[3]\nThe Applicant, who is considered to have brought shame and dishonour to his family, was forced to lead a double life in order to hide his sexual orientation from his family members, who do not tolerate homosexuality. The Applicant fears for his life were he to return to Algeria.",
    "[4]\nIn his lifetime, the Applicant has allegedly had several homosexual experiences with men. When the Applicant was 19 years old, the Applicant's father learned that he had had sexual relations with another man during his lunch break, behind the building of the professional training centre where the Applicant was studying. As a result, the Applicant's father attacked the Applicant and threatened to kill him if he were to have another homosexual relationship.",
    "[5]\nFollowing this incident, the Applicant's father and other members of his family began to monitor and to harass the Applicant. They also started to become suspicious of the Applicant's travels. Feeling stressed and depressed, the Applicant left Algeria. With the help of his brother who lives in Montréal, the Applicant arrived in Canada and claimed refugee protection.",
    "[6]\nFollowing a hearing, the RPD rejected the Applicant's claim on the basis of the Applicant's lack of credibility. The RPD found that the Applicant failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution and did not believe the Applicant to be homosexual (RAD decision at para 7). The Applicant appealed the RPD's decision to the RAD.\nIII.\nDecision under review",
    "[7]\nIn a decision dated October 24, 2013, the RAD confirms the RPD's decision according to which the Applicant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.",
    "[8]\nAt the outset of its decision, the RAD states that the standard of review applicable to the RPD's findings of fact is that of reasonableness (RAD decision at paras 13-18).",
    "[9]\nThe RAD then concludes that the RPD's following credibility findings are reasonable:\na) The Applicant's sexual encounters with another man behind his professional training centre during his lunch break is incoherent with the behaviour of a person allegedly hiding his homosexuality, thus undermining his credibility;\nb) The Applicant's written and oral narratives in respect of the incident in which the Applicant's father attacked the Applicant are incoherent, thus undermining his credibility;\nc) The Applicant's written and oral narratives in respect of his encounters with other men in different cities are incoherent, thus undermining his credibility;\nd) The Applicant's online date profile, which shows the Applicant to be a man seeking a woman, is incompatible with the Applicant's alleged homosexuality, thus undermining his credibility in regard to his sexual orientation. The Applicant's explanations that he held such a profile out of fear that his family members would discover his online profile, and that he nevertheless succeeded in meeting men by sending them private messages, were rejected by the RPD.\nIV.\nRelevant legislative provisions",
    "[10]\nThe following legislative provisions are relevant:\nAppeal\n110\n. (1) Subject to subsections (1.1) and (2), a person or the Minister may appeal, in accordance with the rules of the Board, on a question of law, of fact or of mixed law and fact, to the Refugee Appeal Division against a decision of the Refugee Protection Division to allow or reject the person's claim for refugee protection.\nProcedure\n(3) Subject to subsections (3.1), (4) and (6), the Refugee Appeal Division must proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the record of the proceedings of the Refugee Protection Division, and may accept documentary evidence and written submissions from the Minister and the person who is the subject of the appeal and, in the case of a matter that is conducted before a panel of three members, written submissions from a representative or agent of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and any other person described in the rules of the Board.\nMarginal note: Evidence that may be presented\n(4) On appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\nHearing\n(6) The Refugee Appeal Division may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection (3)\n(a) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal;\n(b) that is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and\n(c) that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\nDecision\n111\n. (1) After considering the appeal, the Refugee Appeal Division shall make one of the following decisions:\n(a) confirm the determination of the Refugee Protection Division;\n(b) set aside the determination and substitute a determination that, in its opinion, should have been made; gold\n(c) refer the matter to the Refugee Protection Division for re-determination, giving the directions to the Refugee Protection Division that it considers appropriate.\nCall\n110\n. (1) Subject to subsections (1.1) and (2), the person concerned and the Minister may, in accordance with the rules of the Board, appeal - on a question of law, fact or mixed - to the Refugee Appeal Division the decision of the Refugee Protection Division granting or rejecting the refugee claim.\nOperation\n(3) Subject to subsections (3.1), (4) and (6), the Division shall proceed without holding a hearing on the basis of the record of the Refugee Protection Division, but may receive documentary evidence and written submissions from the Minister and the person involved and, in the case of a matter before a tribunal of three commissioners, written submissions from the representative or agent of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and from any other person covered by the rules of the Commission.\nAdmissible evidence\n(4) In the course of the appeal, the person in question may present only evidence which has arisen since the refusal of his application or which was not then normally accessible or, if it was, which he would not normally have presented, in the circumstances, at the time of the rejection.\nHearing\n(6) The Division may hold a hearing if it considers that there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection (3) that:\n(a) raise a significant question regarding the credibility of the person involved;\n(b) are essential for the decision on the asylum application;\n(c) assuming they are admitted, would justify the asylum application being granted or refused, as the case may be.\nDecision\n111\n. (1) The Refugee Appeal Division shall confirm the decision appealed against, set aside the decision and substitute the decision which should have been rendered or, in accordance with its instructions, refer the matter back to the Refugee Protection Division.\nv.\nThe position of the Applicant",
    "[11]\nThe Applicant considers that the following issue is determinative of the outcome of this application:\nDid the RAD commit a reviewable error by applying the reasonable standard to the RPD's findings?",
    "[12]\nThe Applicant submits that the RAD erred in reviewing the RPD's findings on the reasonableness standard, rather than the standard of correctness, thus justifying the intervention of the Court. The Applicant submits that the RAD should have scrutinized the RPD's decision, particularly in the context of the issue of evaluating a claim based on sexual orientation and the difficulties in evaluating such claims (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is also the Applicant's view that the RAD owes little or no deference towards the RPD's findings.\nVI. Analysis",
    "[13]\nThe RAD's choice of the appropriate standard of review in hearing an appeal stems directly from its legislative mandate which, thus, falls within its specialized expertise, and in respect of its very existence or reason for being (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).",
    "[14]\nThe Court has recently been confronted with the issue of the scope of review and the appropriate standard applicable when considering an appeal of a decision of the RPD by the RAD (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[15]\nIn certain cases, this Court has found that the RAD's failure to apply the proper analytical framework to the RPD's finding may be sufficient for the Court to quash its decision (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).",
    "[16]\nHowever, the application does not lend itself to such a conclusion.",
    "[17]\nThe RAD, which performs an appellate function, in contrast to one of judicial review, must generally conduct an independent analysis in hearing an appeal, in accordance with the legislative framework stipulated in the IRPA. In this regard, sections 110 and 111(1) of the IRPA provide that the RAD may either confirm the determination of the RPD or set aside the determination and substitute it for that which should have been determined on a question of law, of fact or of mixed fact and law. As a trier of fact, the RPD assesses the witnesses, and views the evidence first-hand in respect of an Applicant's credibility, in light of the evidence as a whole. In consideration of the recent jurisprudence, it is the Court's view that the RAD owes varying degrees of deference to a RPD's decision, depending on whether the RAD is hearing an appeal on issues of credibility or otherwise. In this regard, Justice Yvan Roy indicates, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 40: [40] Mon collègue le juge Phelan aura préféré, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, appliquer la norme de la raisonnabilité aux questions de crédibilité (para 37). Ceci dit avec égards, j'ai toujours cette crainte au sujet de la confusion des genres. Il me semblerait préférable de s'en tenir à la norme d'erreur manifeste et dominante en appel sur les questions de fait. Il n'y a rien de nouveau à la proposition qu'une instance d'appel fait preuve de retenue lorsque l'organisme dont la décision est en appel procède d'une discrétion importante comme l'examen de la crédibilité. La Loi est claire: la SAR n'entend des témoins que dans des cas très exceptionnels et particuliers. La crédibilité à donner aux témoins entendus par la SPR est l'apanage de celle-ci et la SAR, en appel, doit faire preuve de retenue (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nR c Burke\n, [1996] 1 RCS 474).",
    "[18]\nIn the recent case <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 37, Justice Michael L. Phelan supports the view that deference may be owed by the RAD in respect of a RPD's findings on credibility which are critical or determinative to the outcome of the RPD's decision. Some factors derived from the RAD's legislative scheme support this finding. For instance, the RAD, unlike the RPD, is not always required to hold a hearing. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Phelan further indicates: [55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is a \"palpable and overriding error\".",
    "[19]\nThis variable approach was also applied by Justice George J. Locke in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Specifically, Justice Locke found that  [e]xcept in cases where the credibility of a witness is critical or determinative or when the RPD has a particular benefit from the RAD to draw a specific conclusion, the RAD must not give any deference to the analysis of the evidence made by the RPD  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 14).",
    "[20]\nThus, considering that the RPD's decision is solely founded on findings of credibility, the RAD applied the appropriate level of deference towards the RPD's determinations of the Applicant's credibility.\nVII.\nConclusion",
    "[21]\nAccordingly, it is this Court's view that the Applicant did benefit appropriately from the appeal to which he is entitled under the IRPA, as pertaining to the RAD's mandate. Thus, the intervention of the Court is not warranted.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[22]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed;\n2. There is no serious question of general importance to be certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: E. Joanne Oley/nmg\n[End of document]"

The Applicant submits that the RAD should have scrutinized the RPD's decision, particularly in the context of the issue of evaluating a claim based on sexual orientation and the difficulties in evaluating such claims (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is also the Applicant's view that the RAD owes little or no deference towards the RPD's findings.\nVI. Analysis\n\n[13]\nThe RAD's choice of the appropriate standard of review in hearing an appeal stems directly from its legislative mandate which, thus, falls within its specialized expertise, and in respect of its very existence or reason for being (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\n\n[14]\nThe Court has recently been confronted with the issue of the scope of review and the appropriate standard applicable when considering an appeal of a decision of the RPD by the RAD (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[15]\nIn certain cases, this Court has found that the RAD's failure to apply the proper analytical framework to the RPD's finding may be sufficient for the Court to quash its decision (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).\n\n[16]\nHowever, the application does not lend itself to such a conclusion.\n\n[17]\nThe RAD, which performs an appellate function, in contrast to one of judicial review, must generally conduct an independent analysis in hearing an appeal, in accordance with the legislative framework stipulated in the IRPA. In this regard, sections 110 and 111(1) of the IRPA provide that the RAD may either confirm the determination of the RPD or set aside the determination and substitute it for that which should have been determined on a question of law, of fact or of mixed fact and law. As a trier of fact, the RPD assesses the witnesses, and views the evidence first-hand in respect of an Applicant's credibility, in light of the evidence as a whole. In consideration of the recent jurisprudence, it is the Court's view that the RAD owes varying degrees of deference to a RPD's decision, depending on whether the RAD is hearing an appeal on issues of credibility or otherwise. In this regard, Justice Yvan Roy indicates, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 40: [40] Mon collègue le juge Phelan aura préféré, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, appliquer la norme de la raisonnabilité aux questions de crédibilité (para 37). Ceci dit avec égards, j'ai toujours cette crainte au sujet de la confusion des genres. Il me semblerait préférable de s'en tenir à la norme d'erreur manifeste et dominante en appel sur les questions de fait. Il n'y a rien de nouveau à la proposition qu'une instance d'appel fait preuve de retenue lorsque l'organisme dont la décision est en appel procède d'une discrétion importante comme l'examen de la crédibilité. La Loi est claire: la SAR n'entend des témoins que dans des cas très exceptionnels et particuliers. La crédibilité à donner aux témoins entendus par la SPR est l'apanage de celle-ci et la SAR, en appel, doit faire preuve de retenue (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nR c Burke\n, [1996] 1 RCS 474).\n\n[18]\nIn the recent case <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 37, Justice Michael L. Phelan supports the view that deference may be owed by the RAD in respect of a RPD's findings on credibility which are critical or determinative to the outcome of the RPD's decision. Some factors derived from the RAD's legislative scheme support this finding. For instance, the RAD, unlike the RPD, is not always required to hold a hearing. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Phelan further indicates: [55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is a \"palpable and overriding error\".\n\n[19]\nThis variable approach was also applied by Justice George J. Locke in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Specifically, Justice Locke found that  [e]xcept in cases where the credibility of a witness is critical or determinative or when the RPD has a particular benefit from the RAD to draw a specific conclusion, the RAD must not give any deference to the analysis of the evidence made by the RPD  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 14).\n\n[20]\nThus, considering that the RPD's decision is solely founded on findings of credibility, the RAD applied the appropriate level of deference towards the RPD's determinations of the Applicant's credibility.\nVII.\nConclusion\n\n[21]\nAccordingly, it is this Court's view that the Applicant did benefit appropriately from the appeal to which he is entitled under the IRPA, as pertaining to the RAD's mandate. Thus, the intervention of the Court is not warranted.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[22]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed;\n2. There is no serious question of general importance to be certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: E. Joanne Oley/nmg\n[End of document]",

      "The central issue was whether the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) erred in applying the reasonableness standard of review to the Refugee Protection Division’s (RPD) credibility findings, rather than a standard of correctness. The court found no error in the RAD’s approach.",
      "The court acknowledged a divergence in jurisprudence regarding the appropriate standard of review for RPD credibility findings, with some judges favoring reasonableness and others a standard of palpable and overriding error. However, it determined that the RAD’s application of reasonableness was appropriate given its legislative mandate and appellate function.",
      "The court emphasized that the RAD, unlike the RPD, is not always required to hold a hearing, and the RPD, as the initial fact-finder, has a unique advantage in assessing witness credibility. Therefore, the RAD should afford some deference to the RPD’s credibility assessments.",
      "The court cited Justice Phelan’s view that deference is particularly appropriate when the RPD’s credibility findings are critical or determinative to the outcome of the case. However, it also noted Justice Locke’s qualification that less deference is required when the RPD doesn’t have a specific advantage in reaching its conclusions.",
      "Because the RPD’s decision in this case was *solely* based on credibility findings, the court concluded that the RAD appropriately applied the level of deference to the RPD’s credibility determinations. The court found that the RAD’s decision was within the bounds of its appellate function and legislative framework.",
      "The court relied on sections 110 and 111(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which grant the RAD the power to confirm or substitute the RPD’s decision on questions of fact, law, or mixed fact and law, to support its conclusion that the RAD’s approach was legally sound."
