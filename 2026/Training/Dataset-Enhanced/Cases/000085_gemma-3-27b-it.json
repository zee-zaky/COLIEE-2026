Sloan and Curtis Onishenko, for the respondents. \n \n \n \n Solicitors of Record: \n \n Davis, LLP, Edmonton, Alberta, for the applicant; \n \n McKercher McKercher & Whitmore, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, for the respondents. \n \n \n \n This application was heard at Edmonton, Alberta, on June 4, 2008, by Tremblay-Lamer, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following reasons for order on June 12, 2008.",
    "[1] \n   \n Tremblay-Lamer, J. \n : This is an application for judicial review brought by the applicant pursuant to s. 18.1 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 (the  \n Federal Courts Act \n ), as amended, respecting a decision taken on approximately January 8, 2008 whereby Chief Ledoux of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation (MLCN) suspended the duties of the applicant, Councillor Lafond, as a councillor of the MLCN.",
    "[2] \n  The applicant asserts that he was improperly removed from office by a procedure created by the Chief and not according to the procedure set out in the \n   \n Act \n  Respecting the Government Elections and Related Regulations of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation \n  (the  \n Election  \n Act \n ). The respondents submit that this Court does not have jurisdiction to review this decision, and that the Chief was acting according to the authority granted to him by Band custom. \n \n \n \n BACKGROUND",
    "[3] \n  On February 13, 2006, the applicant was elected as a councillor to the MLCN Band Council for a term of three years.",
    "[4] \n  The respondent Band is located in the province of Saskatchewan and has reserve land near the town of Marcelin as well as an urban reserve in the city of Saskatoon. The individual respondent, Gilbert Ledoux, is the Chief of the respondent Band and occupies a position on the Band Council along with the applicant.",
    "[5] \n  In 2000, the MLCN was removed from conducting its elections under the  \n Indian Act \n , R.S., c. I-6 (the  \n Indian Act \n ), by SOR/2000-409. Elections of the MLCN are now carried out pursuant to the  \n Election Act \n .",
    "[6] \n  In late 2007, Chief Ledoux began receiving complaints concerning Councillor Lafond's behaviour towards Band members and Band employees. In addition, other complaints were made to the Chief to the effect that Councillor Lafond was improperly and illegally using Band members' treaty numbers when selling cigarettes from a store which he owned.",
    "[7] \n  In response to these complaints, Chief Ledoux removed the portfolio of Sports, Culture, and Recreation from the applicant in late 2007. On approximately October 26, 2007, the applicant received a letter from Chief Ledoux expressing his concerns regarding the applicant's behaviour and the welfare of the Band members and employees and warning the applicant that there would be consequences if the behaviour continued. Finally, by way of written notice dated January 8, 2008, Councillor Lafond had his duties as councillor suspended by Chief Ledoux. The Band Council was not involved in any of these actions. \n \n \n \n ISSUES \n :",
    "[8] \n  This application raises the following issues: \n \n \n \n -  \n Does this Court have jurisdiction over the present application? \n \n \n \n -  \n Does the Election Act apply? \n \n \n \n ANALYSIS \n \n \n \n Does this Court have jurisdiction over the present application?",
    "[9] \n  In order to determine the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in this matter, it is imperative to properly characterize the action taken by Chief Ledoux in regards to the applicant. In his submissions, the applicant characterizes the action as a removal from office, falling squarely within the four corners of the  \n Election  \n Act \n  which establishes explicit procedures to be followed in such a circumstance. On the other hand, the respondents characterize Chief Ledoux's act as a suspension which does not fall within the  \n Election Act \n , and thus was carried out pursuant to his customary authority as Chief of the MLCN.",
    "[10] \n  The respondents concede that some of the Chief's traditional powers and authority have been replaced by legislation enacted by the Band, and the provisions of the  \n Indian Act \n , but that certain traditional powers and authority remain vested in the Chief such as assigning, moving, and removing portfolios from Band councillors. The Chief thus retains his customary powers and authority where Band legislation has not \"covered the field\". Indeed this was recognized by the Federal Court of Appeal in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, where it held that FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED",
    "[11] \n  I agree that the Chief does have inherent powers to encourage harmony in his community which are rooted in Band custom and that while some of these powers may be modified pursuant to Band legislation and the  \n Indian Act \n , others remain intact and exercisable.",
    "[12] \n  Nevertheless, I am of the view that while couched as a suspension from office, and thus qualitatively different from a removal, what has actually occurred in the present case is a removal of the applicant from his elected position.",
    "[13] \n  I note that the respondents cite  \n Black's Law Dictionary \n , 8th Edition, which defines \"suspension\" as: \"[t]he temporary deprivation of a person's powers or privileges, esp. of office or profession\". The respondents argue that the Chief was \"removing Councillor Lafond's powers and privileges in an emergent situation pending a hearing\". However, no evidence was submitted to this effect, nor was there any evidence indicating that the suspension was for a limited period of time. Further, when probed at the hearing, counsel for the respondents conceded that no hearing was actually pending, nor was any type of appeal procedure envisioned. Thus, in essence, the applicant was stripped of all attributes of his elected position as Councillor for an indefinite period of time and without an avenue of recourse.",
    "[14] \n  For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the applicant was removed from his elected office and not suspended.",
    "[15] \n  Pursuant to s. 18(1) of the  \n Federal Courts  \n Act \n , in order for this Court to have jurisdiction over an application, the decision-maker or decision-making body in question must be a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\". Section 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n  defines a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\" as: \n \n \n \n \"(...) any body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament or by or under an order made pursuant to a prerogative of the Crown, other than the Tax Court of Canada or any of its judges, any such body constituted or established by or under a law of a province or any such person or persons appointed under or in accordance with a law of a province or under section 96 of the  \n Constitution Act, 1867 \n ;\"",
    "[16] \n  Jurisprudence of this Court and others has consistently held that Band Councils are federal boards pursuant to s. 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n  ( \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).",
    "[17] \n  The MLCN has been removed from the application of s. 74 of the  \n Indian Act \n  pertaining to elections, and has thereby reverted to a local customary electoral system as embodied in the  \n Election  \n Act \n . However, even where elections are carried out pursuant to band custom, this Court has consistently found Councils to be acting as a \"federal board[s], commission[s] or other tribunal[s], and thus subject to judicial review (See  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. I stress that included within the category of \"election by band custom\" are matters which are necessarily incidental to elections such as tenure and removal from office (see  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).",
    "[18] \n  In sum, the action of Chief Ledoux constituted a removal from office. Removals from office are considered ancillary to Band election matters and this Court has consistently held that a Band Council or other body with decision-making power over these matters, even where created or elected according to Band custom, will still qualify as a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\".",
    "[19] \n  In the present case, that the Chief was purporting to act on his own initiative as Chief and therefore separate from the Band Council, cannot be used as a pretext to exclude the jurisdiction of the Court. It would be illogical to hold that this Court has no jurisdiction to review an act committed by a Chief acting alone in relation to Band election matters. This would result in precluding the right of applicants to ensure a principled and just process was followed in decisions affecting their rights and privileges when those decisions are made by \"any body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament or by or under an order made pursuant to a prerogative of the Crown\" (s. 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n ).",
    "[20] \n  In the recent decision of  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal, when confronted with a jurisdictional challenge where a Chief had been removed from office, noted that: \n \n \n \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED",
    "[21] \n  Accordingly, I conclude that this Court has jurisdiction over the present application. \n \n \n \n Does the Election  \n Act \n  apply?",
    "[22] \n  As previously indicated, the Band has been removed from conducting its elections under the  \n Indian Act \n  and reverted to customary law governing elections, including incidental issues of tenure and removal from office.",
    "[23] \n  Given that I have concluded, based on the evidence, that Chief Ledoux's action was a removal, I am of the view that the provisions of the  \n Election  \n Act \n  relating to removal of elected Council members from office, are applicable.",
    "[24] \n  With respect to removal, the  \n Election  \n Act \n  states the following: \n \n \n \n \"REMOVAL FROM OFFICE \n \n \n \n \"4. Once duly elected by members of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation, the Chief and Headmen are politically and financially accountable to all members of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation and as such they may be removed from office if they: \n \n \n \n i. Consistently ignore or abuse the 'OATH OF OFFICE'; \n \n \n \n ii. Are absent from three (3) consecutive Muskeg Lake Cree nation assemblies or duly convened council meetings without justified cause; \n \n \n \n iii. Are convicted under the  \n Criminal Code of Canada \n  for an indictable offence or a dual offence on which the Crown has elected to proceed by way of indictment, unless such a conviction relates to the exercise of an aboriginal or treaty right which is a matter of legal dispute.\"",
    "[25] \n  The Oath of Office includes, inter alia, a pledge to respect all laws, policies and traditions of the MLCN, to work for the good of the MLCN, and to respect all other elected officers and employees of the MLCN. Indeed, this is the same Oath of Office referred to by Chief Ledoux in the October 26, 2007 warning letter sent to the applicant.",
    "[26] \n  Further, the section following the provisions relating to removal from office is entitled \"Discipline Procedures\" which sets out the procedure for making complaints against one or more members of the Council. The respondents submit that the Discipline Procedures are inapplicable in the present case because the provisions explicitly state that \"[a]ny member of the [MLCN], 18 years of age or older, either individually or as part of a group, may submit a complaint in writing concerning an alleged violation of section 13 by one or more members of Council\". Section 13 deals with \"Discontinuation of Authority\" and not harassing behavior of a councillor directed to Band members and Band staff.",
    "[27] \n  While I acknowledge that the Discipline Procedures in question do refer to s. 13 of the  \n Election  \n Act \n , on a plain and fair reading this is obviously a typographical error and was meant to refer to s. 3 \"Standard of Conduct for the Chief and Headmen\". Indeed, the Discipline Procedures in question appear in the section of the  \n Election  \n Act \n  relating to removal from office and it would be absurd to construe them as pertaining to \"Discontinuation of Authority\". They clearly relate to removals from office.",
    "[28] \n  The Discipline Procedures are triggered by submitting a complaint which must be accompanied by a petition signed by 35 electors of MLCN. The complaint shall be received by the Chief Executive Officer of the MLCN who will then submit it to a \"Discipline Committee\" or a \"Family Representatives Committee\". Subsequently, the committee will appoint a three person \"Discipline Tribunal\".",
    "[29] \n  The Discipline Tribunal shall then hold a hearing into the complaint in which the complainants and all Council members who are the subject of the complaint will be provided with written notice of the hearing and given an opportunity to present evidence and argument in support of their position. The individual(s) against whom the complaint is made shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to know and respond to the allegations made against him or them as the case may be. The Discipline Tribunal will determine if the complaint has been proven on a balance of probabilities and if it has, may decide to dismiss the individual from office or allow the individual to continue in office with or without conditions attached. \n \n \n \n CONCLUSION",
    "[30] \n  Given the foregoing, I find that the  \n Election  \n Act \n  sets out explicit discipline procedures that must be followed if a councillor is to be removed from his elected position. Chief Ledoux did not follow these procedures and thus could not remove the applicant from his position as Councillor in the manner in which he did. Accordingly, the decision taken by Chief Ledoux shall be quashed; the suspension shall be set aside and declared a nullity. The applicant will continue to occupy his elected position of Band councillor until, and if removed, according to the procedures set out in the  \n Election  \n Act \n .",
    "[31] \n  The applicant has requested that solicitor-client costs be awarded in the present case. I note that in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following regarding the awarding of costs on a solicitor-client basis: \n \n \n \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED",
    "[32] \n  Further, in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED",
    "[33] \n  The applicant has failed to establish that the respondents have displayed reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct in connection with the present litigation or that reasons of public interest exist capable of justifying the exceptional granting of solicitor-client costs in the present application.",
    "[34] \n  To the contrary, I find Chief Ledoux to have acted with the best of intentions in order to deal with a difficult and contentious situation. Faced with multiple complaints of misconduct on the part of the applicant, he took the steps which he felt were appropriate at the time, including the removal of the applicant's portfolio, and issuing both a verbal and a written warning. He undertook a course of action which he believed was in the best interests of the Band and that provided a measure of fairness to the applicant. However, the fact remains that the MLCN has created its own  \n Election  \n Act \n  to govern exactly the situation of misconduct that the Chief was faced with, and this procedure was not followed in the present case. \n \n \n \n ORDER",
    "[35] \n  For these reasons, the application for judicial review of Chief Ledoux's decision will be allowed; the decision is quashed and thereby rendered a nullity. Accordingly, the applicant will continue to occupy his elected position of Band councillor until, and if removed, according to the procedures set out in the  \n Election  \n Act \n . The whole with costs. \n \n \n \n Application allowed. \n \n \n \n Editor: Sharon McCartney/vnh \n \n \n \n [End of document]"

Sloan and Curtis Onishenko, for the respondents. \n \n \n \n Solicitors of Record: \n \n Davis, LLP, Edmonton, Alberta, for the applicant; \n \n McKercher McKercher & Whitmore, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, for the respondents. \n \n \n \n This application was heard at Edmonton, Alberta, on June 4, 2008, by Tremblay-Lamer, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following reasons for order on June 12, 2008. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n [1] \n   \n Tremblay-Lamer, J. \n : This is an application for judicial review brought by the applicant pursuant to s. 18.1 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 (the  \n Federal Courts Act \n ), as amended, respecting a decision taken on approximately January 8, 2008 whereby Chief Ledoux of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation (MLCN) suspended the duties of the applicant, Councillor Lafond, as a councillor of the MLCN. \n \n \n \n [2] \n  The applicant asserts that he was improperly removed from office by a procedure created by the Chief and not according to the procedure set out in the \n   \n Act \n  Respecting the Government Elections and Related Regulations of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation \n  (the  \n Election  \n Act \n ). The respondents submit that this Court does not have jurisdiction to review this decision, and that the Chief was acting according to the authority granted to him by Band custom. \n \n \n \n BACKGROUND \n \n \n \n [3] \n  On February 13, 2006, the applicant was elected as a councillor to the MLCN Band Council for a term of three years. \n \n \n \n [4] \n  The respondent Band is located in the province of Saskatchewan and has reserve land near the town of Marcelin as well as an urban reserve in the city of Saskatoon. The individual respondent, Gilbert Ledoux, is the Chief of the respondent Band and occupies a position on the Band Council along with the applicant. \n \n \n \n [5] \n  In 2000, the MLCN was removed from conducting its elections under the  \n Indian Act \n , R.S., c. I-6 (the  \n Indian Act \n ), by SOR/2000-409. Elections of the MLCN are now carried out pursuant to the  \n Election Act \n . \n \n \n \n [6] \n  In late 2007, Chief Ledoux began receiving complaints concerning Councillor Lafond's behaviour towards Band members and Band employees. In addition, other complaints were made to the Chief to the effect that Councillor Lafond was improperly and illegally using Band members' treaty numbers when selling cigarettes from a store which he owned. \n \n \n \n [7] \n  In response to these complaints, Chief Ledoux removed the portfolio of Sports, Culture, and Recreation from the applicant in late 2007. On approximately October 26, 2007, the applicant received a letter from Chief Ledoux expressing his concerns regarding the applicant's behaviour and the welfare of the Band members and employees and warning the applicant that there would be consequences if the behaviour continued. Finally, by way of written notice dated January 8, 2008, Councillor Lafond had his duties as councillor suspended by Chief Ledoux. The Band Council was not involved in any of these actions. \n \n \n \n ISSUES \n : \n \n \n \n [8] \n  This application raises the following issues: \n \n \n \n -  \n Does this Court have jurisdiction over the present application? \n \n \n \n -  \n Does the Election Act apply? \n \n \n \n ANALYSIS \n \n \n \n Does this Court have jurisdiction over the present application? \n \n \n \n [9] \n  In order to determine the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in this matter, it is imperative to properly characterize the action taken by Chief Ledoux in regards to the applicant.

Thus, in essence, the applicant was stripped of all attributes of his elected position as Councillor for an indefinite period of time and without an avenue of recourse. \n \n \n \n [14] \n  For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the applicant was removed from his elected office and not suspended. \n \n \n \n [15] \n  Pursuant to s. 18(1) of the  \n Federal Courts  \n Act \n , in order for this Court to have jurisdiction over an application, the decision-maker or decision-making body in question must be a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\". Section 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n  defines a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\" as: \n \n \n \n \"(...) any body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament or by or under an order made pursuant to a prerogative of the Crown, other than the Tax Court of Canada or any of its judges, any such body constituted or established by or under a law of a province or any such person or persons appointed under or in accordance with a law of a province or under section 96 of the  \n Constitution Act, 1867 \n ;\" \n \n \n \n [16] \n  Jurisprudence of this Court and others has consistently held that Band Councils are federal boards pursuant to s. 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n  ( \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). \n \n \n \n [17] \n  The MLCN has been removed from the application of s. 74 of the  \n Indian Act \n  pertaining to elections, and has thereby reverted to a local customary electoral system as embodied in the  \n Election  \n Act \n . However, even where elections are carried out pursuant to band custom, this Court has consistently found Councils to be acting as a \"federal board[s], commission[s] or other tribunal[s], and thus subject to judicial review (See  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. I stress that included within the category of \"election by band custom\" are matters which are necessarily incidental to elections such as tenure and removal from office (see  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). \n \n \n \n [18] \n  In sum, the action of Chief Ledoux constituted a removal from office. Removals from office are considered ancillary to Band election matters and this Court has consistently held that a Band Council or other body with decision-making power over these matters, even where created or elected according to Band custom, will still qualify as a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\". \n \n \n \n [19] \n  In the present case, that the Chief was purporting to act on his own initiative as Chief and therefore separate from the Band Council, cannot be used as a pretext to exclude the jurisdiction of the Court. It would be illogical to hold that this Court has no jurisdiction to review an act committed by a Chief acting alone in relation to Band election matters. This would result in precluding the right of applicants to ensure a principled and just process was followed in decisions affecting their rights and privileges when those decisions are made by \"any body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament or by or under an order made pursuant to a prerogative of the Crown\" (s. 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n ). \n \n \n \n [20] \n  In the recent decision of  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal, when confronted with a jurisdictional challenge where a Chief had been removed from office, noted that: \n \n \n \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED\n \n \n \n [21] \n  Accordingly, I conclude that this Court has jurisdiction over the present application. \n \n \n \n Does the Election  \n Act \n  apply? \n \n \n \n [22] \n  As previously indicated, the Band has been removed from conducting its elections under the  \n Indian Act \n  and reverted to customary law governing elections, including incidental issues of tenure and removal from office. \n \n \n \n [23] \n  Given that I have concluded, based on the evidence, that Chief Ledoux's action was a removal, I am of the view that the provisions of the  \n Election  \n Act \n  relating to removal of elected Council members from office, are applicable. \n \n \n \n [24] \n  With respect to removal, the  \n Election  \n Act \n  states the following: \n \n \n \n \"REMOVAL FROM OFFICE \n \n \n \n \"4. Once duly elected by members of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation, the Chief and Headmen are politically and financially accountable to all members of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation and as such they may be removed from office if they: \n \n \n \n i. Consistently ignore or abuse the 'OATH OF OFFICE'; \n \n \n \n ii. Are absent from three (3) consecutive Muskeg Lake Cree nation assemblies or duly convened council meetings without justified cause; \n \n \n \n iii. Are convicted under the  \n Criminal Code of Canada \n  for an indictable offence or a dual offence on which the Crown has elected to proceed by way of indictment, unless such a conviction relates to the exercise of an aboriginal or treaty right which is a matter of legal dispute.\" \n \n \n \n [25] \n  The Oath of Office includes, inter alia, a pledge to respect all laws, policies and traditions of the MLCN, to work for the good of the MLCN, and to respect all other elected officers and employees of the MLCN. Indeed, this is the same Oath of Office referred to by Chief Ledoux in the October 26, 2007 warning letter sent to the applicant. \n \n \n \n [26] \n  Further, the section following the provisions relating to removal from office is entitled \"Discipline Procedures\" which sets out the procedure for making complaints against one or more members of the Council. The respondents submit that the Discipline Procedures are inapplicable in the present case because the provisions explicitly state that \"[a]ny member of the [MLCN], 18 years of age or older, either individually or as part of a group, may submit a complaint in writing concerning an alleged violation of section 13 by one or more members of Council\". Section 13 deals with \"Discontinuation of Authority\" and not harassing behavior of a councillor directed to Band members and Band staff. \n \n \n \n [27] \n  While I acknowledge that the Discipline Procedures in question do refer to s. 13 of the  \n Election  \n Act \n , on a plain and fair reading this is obviously a typographical error and was meant to refer to s. 3 \"Standard of Conduct for the Chief and Headmen\". Indeed, the Discipline Procedures in question appear in the section of the  \n Election  \n Act \n  relating to removal from office and it would be absurd to construe them as pertaining to \"Discontinuation of Authority\". They clearly relate to removals from office. \n \n \n \n [28] \n  The Discipline Procedures are triggered by submitting a complaint which must be accompanied by a petition signed by 35 electors of MLCN. The complaint shall be received by the Chief Executive Officer of the MLCN who will then submit it to a \"Discipline Committee\" or a \"Family Representatives Committee\". Subsequently, the committee will appoint a three person \"Discipline Tribunal\". \n \n \n \n [29] \n  The Discipline Tribunal shall then hold a hearing into the complaint in which the complainants and all Council members who are the subject of the complaint will be provided with written notice of the hearing and given an opportunity to present evidence and argument in support of their position. The individual(s) against whom the complaint is made shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to know and respond to the allegations made against him or them as the case may be. The Discipline Tribunal will determine if the complaint has been proven on a balance of probabilities and if it has, may decide to dismiss the individual from office or allow the individual to continue in office with or without conditions attached. \n \n \n \n CONCLUSION \n \n \n \n [30] \n  Given the foregoing, I find that the  \n Election  \n Act \n  sets out explicit discipline procedures that must be followed if a councillor is to be removed from his elected position. Chief Ledoux did not follow these procedures and thus could not remove the applicant from his position as Councillor in the manner in which he did. Accordingly, the decision taken by Chief Ledoux shall be quashed; the suspension shall be set aside and declared a nullity. The applicant will continue to occupy his elected position of Band councillor until, and if removed, according to the procedures set out in the  \n Election  \n Act \n . \n \n \n \n [31] \n  The applicant has requested that solicitor-client costs be awarded in the present case. I note that in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following regarding the awarding of costs on a solicitor-client basis: \n \n \n \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED\n \n \n \n [32] \n  Further, in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED\n \n \n \n [33] \n  The applicant has failed to establish that the respondents have displayed reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct in connection with the present litigation or that reasons of public interest exist capable of justifying the exceptional granting of solicitor-client costs in the present application. \n \n \n \n [34] \n  To the contrary, I find Chief Ledoux to have acted with the best of intentions in order to deal with a difficult and contentious situation. Faced with multiple complaints of misconduct on the part of the applicant, he took the steps which he felt were appropriate at the time, including the removal of the applicant's portfolio, and issuing both a verbal and a written warning. He undertook a course of action which he believed was in the best interests of the Band and that provided a measure of fairness to the applicant. However, the fact remains that the MLCN has created its own  \n Election  \n Act \n  to govern exactly the situation of misconduct that the Chief was faced with, and this procedure was not followed in the present case. \n \n \n \n ORDER \n \n \n \n [35] \n  For these reasons, the application for judicial review of Chief Ledoux's decision will be allowed; the decision is quashed and thereby rendered a nullity. Accordingly, the applicant will continue to occupy his elected position of Band councillor until, and if removed, according to the procedures set out in the  \n Election  \n Act \n .

Sloan and Curtis Onishenko, for the respondents. \n \n \n \n Solicitors of Record: \n \n Davis, LLP, Edmonton, Alberta, for the applicant; \n \n McKercher McKercher & Whitmore, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, for the respondents. \n \n \n \n This application was heard at Edmonton, Alberta, on June 4, 2008, by Tremblay-Lamer, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following reasons for order on June 12, 2008.\n\n[1] \n   \n Tremblay-Lamer, J. \n : This is an application for judicial review brought by the applicant pursuant to s. 18.1 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 (the  \n Federal Courts Act \n ), as amended, respecting a decision taken on approximately January 8, 2008 whereby Chief Ledoux of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation (MLCN) suspended the duties of the applicant, Councillor Lafond, as a councillor of the MLCN.\n\n[2] \n  The applicant asserts that he was improperly removed from office by a procedure created by the Chief and not according to the procedure set out in the \n   \n Act \n  Respecting the Government Elections and Related Regulations of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation \n  (the  \n Election  \n Act \n ). The respondents submit that this Court does not have jurisdiction to review this decision, and that the Chief was acting according to the authority granted to him by Band custom. \n \n \n \n BACKGROUND\n\n[3] \n  On February 13, 2006, the applicant was elected as a councillor to the MLCN Band Council for a term of three years.\n\n[4] \n  The respondent Band is located in the province of Saskatchewan and has reserve land near the town of Marcelin as well as an urban reserve in the city of Saskatoon. The individual respondent, Gilbert Ledoux, is the Chief of the respondent Band and occupies a position on the Band Council along with the applicant.\n\n[5] \n  In 2000, the MLCN was removed from conducting its elections under the  \n Indian Act \n , R.S., c. I-6 (the  \n Indian Act \n ), by SOR/2000-409. Elections of the MLCN are now carried out pursuant to the  \n Election Act \n .\n\n[6] \n  In late 2007, Chief Ledoux began receiving complaints concerning Councillor Lafond's behaviour towards Band members and Band employees. In addition, other complaints were made to the Chief to the effect that Councillor Lafond was improperly and illegally using Band members' treaty numbers when selling cigarettes from a store which he owned.\n\n[7] \n  In response to these complaints, Chief Ledoux removed the portfolio of Sports, Culture, and Recreation from the applicant in late 2007. On approximately October 26, 2007, the applicant received a letter from Chief Ledoux expressing his concerns regarding the applicant's behaviour and the welfare of the Band members and employees and warning the applicant that there would be consequences if the behaviour continued. Finally, by way of written notice dated January 8, 2008, Councillor Lafond had his duties as councillor suspended by Chief Ledoux. The Band Council was not involved in any of these actions. \n \n \n \n ISSUES \n :\n\n[8] \n  This application raises the following issues: \n \n \n \n -  \n Does this Court have jurisdiction over the present application? \n \n \n \n -  \n Does the Election Act apply? \n \n \n \n ANALYSIS \n \n \n \n Does this Court have jurisdiction over the present application?\n\n[9] \n  In order to determine the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in this matter, it is imperative to properly characterize the action taken by Chief Ledoux in regards to the applicant. In his submissions, the applicant characterizes the action as a removal from office, falling squarely within the four corners of the  \n Election  \n Act \n  which establishes explicit procedures to be followed in such a circumstance. On the other hand, the respondents characterize Chief Ledoux's act as a suspension which does not fall within the  \n Election Act \n , and thus was carried out pursuant to his customary authority as Chief of the MLCN.\n\n[10] \n  The respondents concede that some of the Chief's traditional powers and authority have been replaced by legislation enacted by the Band, and the provisions of the  \n Indian Act \n , but that certain traditional powers and authority remain vested in the Chief such as assigning, moving, and removing portfolios from Band councillors. The Chief thus retains his customary powers and authority where Band legislation has not \"covered the field\". Indeed this was recognized by the Federal Court of Appeal in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, where it held that FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED\n\n[11] \n  I agree that the Chief does have inherent powers to encourage harmony in his community which are rooted in Band custom and that while some of these powers may be modified pursuant to Band legislation and the  \n Indian Act \n , others remain intact and exercisable.\n\n[12] \n  Nevertheless, I am of the view that while couched as a suspension from office, and thus qualitatively different from a removal, what has actually occurred in the present case is a removal of the applicant from his elected position.\n\n[13] \n  I note that the respondents cite  \n Black's Law Dictionary \n , 8th Edition, which defines \"suspension\" as: \"[t]he temporary deprivation of a person's powers or privileges, esp. of office or profession\". The respondents argue that the Chief was \"removing Councillor Lafond's powers and privileges in an emergent situation pending a hearing\". However, no evidence was submitted to this effect, nor was there any evidence indicating that the suspension was for a limited period of time. Further, when probed at the hearing, counsel for the respondents conceded that no hearing was actually pending, nor was any type of appeal procedure envisioned. Thus, in essence, the applicant was stripped of all attributes of his elected position as Councillor for an indefinite period of time and without an avenue of recourse.\n\n[14] \n  For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the applicant was removed from his elected office and not suspended.\n\n[15] \n  Pursuant to s. 18(1) of the  \n Federal Courts  \n Act \n , in order for this Court to have jurisdiction over an application, the decision-maker or decision-making body in question must be a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\". Section 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n  defines a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\" as: \n \n \n \n \"(...) any body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament or by or under an order made pursuant to a prerogative of the Crown, other than the Tax Court of Canada or any of its judges, any such body constituted or established by or under a law of a province or any such person or persons appointed under or in accordance with a law of a province or under section 96 of the  \n Constitution Act, 1867 \n ;\"\n\n[16] \n  Jurisprudence of this Court and others has consistently held that Band Councils are federal boards pursuant to s. 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n  ( \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).\n\n[17] \n  The MLCN has been removed from the application of s. 74 of the  \n Indian Act \n  pertaining to elections, and has thereby reverted to a local customary electoral system as embodied in the  \n Election  \n Act \n . However, even where elections are carried out pursuant to band custom, this Court has consistently found Councils to be acting as a \"federal board[s], commission[s] or other tribunal[s], and thus subject to judicial review (See  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. I stress that included within the category of \"election by band custom\" are matters which are necessarily incidental to elections such as tenure and removal from office (see  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).\n\n[18] \n  In sum, the action of Chief Ledoux constituted a removal from office. Removals from office are considered ancillary to Band election matters and this Court has consistently held that a Band Council or other body with decision-making power over these matters, even where created or elected according to Band custom, will still qualify as a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\".\n\n[19] \n  In the present case, that the Chief was purporting to act on his own initiative as Chief and therefore separate from the Band Council, cannot be used as a pretext to exclude the jurisdiction of the Court. It would be illogical to hold that this Court has no jurisdiction to review an act committed by a Chief acting alone in relation to Band election matters. This would result in precluding the right of applicants to ensure a principled and just process was followed in decisions affecting their rights and privileges when those decisions are made by \"any body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament or by or under an order made pursuant to a prerogative of the Crown\" (s. 2 of the  \n Federal Courts Act \n ).\n\n[20] \n  In the recent decision of  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal, when confronted with a jurisdictional challenge where a Chief had been removed from office, noted that: \n \n \n \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED\n\n[21] \n  Accordingly, I conclude that this Court has jurisdiction over the present application. \n \n \n \n Does the Election  \n Act \n  apply?\n\n[22] \n  As previously indicated, the Band has been removed from conducting its elections under the  \n Indian Act \n  and reverted to customary law governing elections, including incidental issues of tenure and removal from office.\n\n[23] \n  Given that I have concluded, based on the evidence, that Chief Ledoux's action was a removal, I am of the view that the provisions of the  \n Election  \n Act \n  relating to removal of elected Council members from office, are applicable.\n\n[24] \n  With respect to removal, the  \n Election  \n Act \n  states the following: \n \n \n \n \"REMOVAL FROM OFFICE \n \n \n \n \"4. Once duly elected by members of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation, the Chief and Headmen are politically and financially accountable to all members of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation and as such they may be removed from office if they: \n \n \n \n i. Consistently ignore or abuse the 'OATH OF OFFICE'; \n \n \n \n ii. Are absent from three (3) consecutive Muskeg Lake Cree nation assemblies or duly convened council meetings without justified cause; \n \n \n \n iii. Are convicted under the  \n Criminal Code of Canada \n  for an indictable offence or a dual offence on which the Crown has elected to proceed by way of indictment, unless such a conviction relates to the exercise of an aboriginal or treaty right which is a matter of legal dispute.\"\n\n[25] \n  The Oath of Office includes, inter alia, a pledge to respect all laws, policies and traditions of the MLCN, to work for the good of the MLCN, and to respect all other elected officers and employees of the MLCN. Indeed, this is the same Oath of Office referred to by Chief Ledoux in the October 26, 2007 warning letter sent to the applicant.\n\n[26] \n  Further, the section following the provisions relating to removal from office is entitled \"Discipline Procedures\" which sets out the procedure for making complaints against one or more members of the Council. The respondents submit that the Discipline Procedures are inapplicable in the present case because the provisions explicitly state that \"[a]ny member of the [MLCN], 18 years of age or older, either individually or as part of a group, may submit a complaint in writing concerning an alleged violation of section 13 by one or more members of Council\". Section 13 deals with \"Discontinuation of Authority\" and not harassing behavior of a councillor directed to Band members and Band staff.\n\n[27] \n  While I acknowledge that the Discipline Procedures in question do refer to s. 13 of the  \n Election  \n Act \n , on a plain and fair reading this is obviously a typographical error and was meant to refer to s. 3 \"Standard of Conduct for the Chief and Headmen\". Indeed, the Discipline Procedures in question appear in the section of the  \n Election  \n Act \n  relating to removal from office and it would be absurd to construe them as pertaining to \"Discontinuation of Authority\". They clearly relate to removals from office.\n\n[28] \n  The Discipline Procedures are triggered by submitting a complaint which must be accompanied by a petition signed by 35 electors of MLCN. The complaint shall be received by the Chief Executive Officer of the MLCN who will then submit it to a \"Discipline Committee\" or a \"Family Representatives Committee\". Subsequently, the committee will appoint a three person \"Discipline Tribunal\".\n\n[29] \n  The Discipline Tribunal shall then hold a hearing into the complaint in which the complainants and all Council members who are the subject of the complaint will be provided with written notice of the hearing and given an opportunity to present evidence and argument in support of their position. The individual(s) against whom the complaint is made shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to know and respond to the allegations made against him or them as the case may be. The Discipline Tribunal will determine if the complaint has been proven on a balance of probabilities and if it has, may decide to dismiss the individual from office or allow the individual to continue in office with or without conditions attached. \n \n \n \n CONCLUSION\n\n[30] \n  Given the foregoing, I find that the  \n Election  \n Act \n  sets out explicit discipline procedures that must be followed if a councillor is to be removed from his elected position. Chief Ledoux did not follow these procedures and thus could not remove the applicant from his position as Councillor in the manner in which he did. Accordingly, the decision taken by Chief Ledoux shall be quashed; the suspension shall be set aside and declared a nullity. The applicant will continue to occupy his elected position of Band councillor until, and if removed, according to the procedures set out in the  \n Election  \n Act \n .\n\n[31] \n  The applicant has requested that solicitor-client costs be awarded in the present case.

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether the court had jurisdiction to review the Chief’s actions and whether those actions complied with the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation’s (MLCN) Election Act. The court determined it *did* have jurisdiction because, despite the MLCN reverting to a customary electoral system, the Band Council was still acting as a 'federal board' under the Federal Courts Act, particularly concerning matters incidental to elections like removal from office.",
      "The court found that the Chief’s action, despite being framed as a 'suspension,' was effectively a removal from office. This determination was based on the indefinite nature of the suspension, the lack of any evidence of a temporary deprivation of powers, and the absence of any planned hearing or appeal process.",
      "The court interpreted the Election Act to apply to the situation, specifically the provisions regarding removal of elected council members. It determined the Chief was required to follow the explicit discipline procedures outlined in the Act, which he did not.",
      "The court clarified that the MLCN’s Election Act, even though based on custom, established a specific process for removal that superseded any customary authority the Chief might otherwise have. The court found a typographical error in the Act relating to the section cited for discipline procedures, but corrected it based on the overall context and purpose of the Act.",
      "The court rejected the applicant’s request for solicitor-client costs, finding no evidence of reprehensible or scandalous conduct by the Chief. It acknowledged the Chief acted in good faith, attempting to address complaints and act in the best interests of the Band, even if the process was legally flawed.",
      "The court relied on established jurisprudence, including cases cited from the Federal Court of Appeal, to support its findings regarding jurisdiction and the application of the Federal Courts Act to Band Council actions."

    "final_outcome": [
      "Application for judicial review allowed.",
      "Chief Ledoux's decision quashed.",
      "Suspension set aside and declared a nullity.",
      "Applicant to continue in elected position until, and if removed, according to the procedures set out in the Election Act.",
      "Costs awarded to the applicant."
