    "[1]\nMcNair, J.\n: This is a motion by the applicant pursuant to rule 336(5) appealing an order made by the Associate Senior Prothonotary on April 6, 1985. The order dismissed the applicant's motion for leave pursuant to rule 704(8) to file the affidavit of one Chris Yaneff in support of the applicant's originating notice of motion for copyright expungement. The Yaneff affidavit, sworn on December 15, 1986, was served on that date on the solicitors for the respondent, while attending at the offices of the solicitors for the applicant on their cross-examination of Donald T. Barber on his affidavit. It was pointed out to the solicitors for the applicant that they were not entitled to file the Yaneff affidavit without leave. Nevertheless, counsel for the applicant insists that the applicant's solicitors were not officially advised by the respondent's solicitors until March 30, 1987 that they were not willing to consent to the filing of the Yaneff affidavit. This prompted the notice of motion on the following day for an order for leave to file such affidavit. The Associate Senior Prothonotary gave no written reasons for dismissing the motion, nor was he bound to do so. The order indicates that he did state oral reasons for dismissing the motion.",
    "[2]\nThe respondent, Datafile, holds copyright registrations, being Nos. 333,976 and 333,977, for its alphabetic and numeric colour-coded file labelling systems. The applicant, DRG, seeks the expungement of the copyright registrations pursuant to s. 40(4)(b) of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-30 and rule 702(3) of the Federal Court Rules.",
    "[3]\nDRG's amended originating notice of motion was filed and served on June 19, 1986. Datafile entered an appearance on June 25, 1986. Applications were then made for cross-examination on affidavits. Datafile brought on a motion for leave to cross-examine DRG's affiant, Michael Black. DRG brought a motion seeking leave to file the affidavit of one Bud Korol. On October 9, 1986 orders were made by the prothonotary granting what was sought by the motions. Datafile was given leave to cross-examine Black and file its statement of defence within 30 days from the date of the order and DRG was granted leave to file the Korol affidavit with leave to Datafile to cross-examine thereon. On October 21, 1986 Black and Korol were cross-examined on their respective affidavits. DRG filed its defence to the originating notice of motion on November 7, 1986. On the same date, Datafile filed the supporting affidavits of Donald T. Barber, Denis Cliff and Karen Okada. Arrangements were made for cross-examination on these affidavits at the offices of the applicant's solicitors on December 15, 1987. The Cliff and Okada affidavits give expert opinions on the ultimate issue of whether the Datafile labels have any significant degree of artistic merit in achieving their functional purpose and result. The experts contrast the Datafile labels and the Tab labels and conclude that those of Datafile possess a higher degree of artistic merit.",
    "[4]\nIt was only on the filing of these opinion affidavits that the applicant's solicitors came to realize that DRG was left without any expert evidence. Consequently, they engaged the services of Chris Yaneff in an effort to plug the gap. Gervas W. Wall, a solicitor in the applicant's firm of solicitors, swore an affidavit on March 31, 1987 in support of the application to the Associate Senior Prothonotary for leave to file the Yaneff affidavit, in which he deposed in paragraphs 8 and 9 as follows:\n\"8. Mr. Yaneff is the only expert witness on behalf of the applicant and his affidavit would be the only one that could answer the respondent's two expert affidavits.\n\"9. I believe the respondent will not be prejudiced by the filing of this affidavit. Its two expert affidavits have already fully addressed the issues raised in Mr. Yaneff's affidavit. Further, Mr. Yaneff's affidavit was served prior to commencing cross-examination of the respondent's experts and therefore the respondent has had an opportunity to respond to all the matters raised in Mr. Yaneff's affidavit. The applicant is even prepared to consent to cross-examination on Mr. Yaneff's affidavit without the necessity of the respondent seeking leave.\"",
    "[5]\nCounsel for the applicant takes the position that the order of the prothonotary was given without written reasons whereby any appeal therefrom must of necessity proceed as a hearing de novo. In support of this submission, he cites the cases of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 317 (Ont. H.C.), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.).",
    "[6]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  which in the normal course would involve an exercise of his discretion and would generally speaking not be reviewable on appeal unless he acted unjudicially and contrary to principle and authority. As I have observed on former occasions where a judicial officer of this court makes an order without giving reasons in a matter involving the exercise of his discretion he places an appellate court in a position where it has no access to his determination and so the court appealed to must of necessity proceed de novo.\"",
    "[7]\nCounsel for the respondent contends that the matter should not be heard de novo in face of the well established principle that an appellate court will not lightly interfere with a discretionary order of a lower court unless it can be demonstrated that the lower court took an erroneous view of the facts or proceeded upon a wrong principle, or unless the appellate court is convinced that the decision represented a failure of justice. He cites in this regard  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 743 (B.C.C.A).",
    "[8] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[9]\nRule 336(5) requires that a party appealing an order or decision of a prothonotary must give a notice of appeal \"setting forth the ground of objection\". The grounds of appeal are that the prothonotary erred in law in refusing to grant leave to file the Yaneff affidavit, contrary to the principle stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The notice of appeal asked for such further or other relief as may be deemed appropriate.",
    "[10]\nCounsel for the respondent submits that the prothonotary had before him the same evidence and material presented on the appeal and had the benefit of the selfsame arguments. He contends that the prothonotary made his decision on the ground that rule 704 clearly mandates a summary procedure in proceedings of this nature that must be explicitly followed with respect to the filing of affidavits. Actually, this is the main argument of the respondent on the appeal.",
    "[11]\nCounsel for the applicant says that the prothonotary gave undue weight to rule 704 which is primarily applicable to trademark proceedings, that he failed to consider the discretionary ambit of rule 704(8), and that he erred in misapplying the Ethicon principle.",
    "[12]\nThe authority for instituting an action for expungement of copyright by way of originating notice of motion is contained in rule 702(3), which reads:\n\"702(3) Proceedings under subsection 40(4) of the Copyright Act shall be instituted by originating notice of motion or petition.\"",
    "[13]\nRule 703(3) is also relevant, providing as follows:\n\"A person served with the statement of claim or declaration, originating notice, petition or other document by which any proceeding referred to in rule 702 is commenced, except in a case to which subsection 49(10) or section 59 of the Trade Marks Act applies, who desires to oppose the granting of the relief sought shall, within 30 days after the date of service upon him, file a defence and sew e the same upon the plaintiff or applicant.\"",
    "[14]\nThe summary procedure to be followed on an originating notice of motion under s. 59 of the Trade Marks Act is set out in rule 704. Pursuant to subrule 704(3), an applicant must serve the affidavits upon which he proposes to rely within 15 days after service of the originating notice of motion. The respondent has 30 days after service of the originating notice to file and serve a reply. Under subrule 704(6), the respondent must file any affidavits which he proposes to put before the court within 30 days after service of the applicant's affidavits. By virtue of subrule 704(8), no affidavits or other material shall be filed for use in the proceedings otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this rule or by order of the court.",
    "[15]\nRule 705 states:\n\"(1) In proceedings referred to in rule 702, unless the court otherwise orders in a particular case,\n(a) no proceedings by way of discovery shall be taken; and\n(b) upon the filing of the documents authorized by rules 703 and 704, or the expiration of the time allowed therefor, the matter shall be deemed to be ready for hearing.\n\"(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the court may at any stage of the proceeding make such order or direction as seems expedient concerning the conduct of the proceedings before, after, and during the hearing thereof.\n\"(3) Except to the extent that they are inconsistent with a statutory provision or a provision made under statutory authority, or are inconsistent with rules 703 and 704 or with this rule, the other provisions of these rules, with necessary modifications and insofar as they are reasonably appropriate, are applicable to proceedings referred to in rule 702.\"",
    "[16]\nGenerally speaking, rule 704 describes a summary procedure for trademark cases whereby each party is required to file its affidavits at one time and it is only by exception that additional affidavits are permitted out of time and then only if a valid explanation has been given for the delay and it has been demonstrated that the facts contained therein are necessary to enable the court to properly adjudicate on the issue:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[17]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the court permitted the filing of two affidavits of expert opinion as to the proper French pronunciation of a word but rejected a third affidavit on matters which constituted rebuttal. This was a trademark case in which Mr. Justice Walsh went to some pains to reconcile the requirement for summary disposition with the principle that the court should have access to all relevant information. The learned judge stated the principle at p. 132:\n\"The court must strike a fine balance between on the one hand the desirability of dealing with proceedings of this nature in a summary manner without unduly extending and delaying them by permitting a multiplicity of affidavits, lengthy cross-examination on each and an extensive production of documents, and on the other hand, the desirability of making sure that the judge called upon to hear the matter on the merits of the originating notice shall have before him all information which is relevant and material to enable him to make a proper decision.\"",
    "[18]\nIt is on this point of having all relevant expert evidence before the court that counsel for the applicant primarily relies in seeking leave to file the Yaneff affidavit. He makes the further point that neither of the parties strictly adhered to the summary procedure prescribed by rule 704, pointing out that the respondent's defence and supporting affidavits were not filed until November 7, 1986. Essentially, the basic thrust of the applicant's submission is that the respondent got the benefit of a relaxation of the time limits prescribed by the rules in obtaining upwards of five months to put in its case and that the application for leave to file the Yaneff affidavit, viewed realistically in this context, asks for nothing more in the way of indulgence than that which had already been accorded to the respondent. Counsel for the applicant also points out that of the three affidavits filed by the respondent, two give expert evidence on the issue of artistic merit. He maintains that it was only on the filing of these affidavits that his client came to realize that it was left in the unfortunate position of having no expert evidence of its own to counteract the expert evidence of the respondent. Counsel for the respondent says that the applicant should have anticipated the need for expert evidence from the very outset.",
    "[19]\nUnder rule 703(3) the respondent should have filed its defence in the normal course of proceedings within 30 days after service of the amended originating notice of motion on June 19, 1986. Pursuant to rule 704(6) any affidavits proposed to be put in should have been filed within 30 days after service of the applicant's affidavits. As of June 11, 1986 the only affidavit filed by the applicant was Michael Black's. The originating notice of motion was initially set down for hearing on June 24, 1986. Counsel for the respondent requested time to prepare his client's defence and an order was made adjourning the hearing of the originating motion to a date to be fixed upon joint request. The respondent then embarked on a strategy of cross-examination on affidavits, as previously noted. Moreover, counsel for the respondent conceded in his argument on the appeal that the only period of delay relevant to the proceedings was the period from June to December, 1986.",
    "[20]\nIn my opinion, rule 704 is not a rigid code of procedure that must be strictly applied and followed in any and all circumstances, without any permitted deviation therefrom. The court has a discretion under rule 704(8) to permit the filing of further affidavits or material, where the circumstances warrant and no injustice will be occasioned thereby. One such special circumstance could be the situation where the parties themselves, as in the present case, chose to depart from the strict letter of the rule. Here, the respondent deliberately adopted the battle strategy of embarking on cross-examination on affidavits instead of proceeding to file its defence within 30 days after service of the originating motion, as required by rule 703(3). As a prelude, the respondent sought and obtained an order for late filing of its defence and affidavit evidence. Seemingly, arrangements were made by consent for cross-examination on the Barber, Cliff and Okada affidavits. Moreover, I consider that rule 704 falls short of laying down an immutable code of procedure for copyright expungement proceedings that must be read in isolated context from rules 703 and 705. It is noteworthy, in my view, that subrule 705(2) gives the court a further discretion to make such order or direction \"as seems expedient concerning the conduct of the proceedings\".",
    "[21]\nCourts are chary about relaxing the time limits imposed by the rules with respect to the various steps involved in the litigation process because of the public policy concern that there be some finality to litigation. By the same token, the day is long past when an honest litigant can be tripped up and banished from the game merely by having taken a mistaken step in his litigation. Is it fair in the circumstances of this case that the applicant be denied leave to file the Yaneff affidavit? My answer is no.",
    "[22]\nIn my opinion, the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred by attaching disproportionate weight to what he conceived to be the summary nature of the proceedings and in failing to give due or any weight to the discretionary provisions of rules 704(8) and 705(2). I am also of the opinion that he misconceived the balance principle enunciated by Walsh, J., in the Ethicon case. Moreover, once the respondent opened the door to expert evidence then, as it seems to me, the door should be left ajar for entry of the Yaneff affidavit to enable the court to make a proper adjudication. I fail to see that this will work any great prejudice on the respondent. Its own expert affidavits are already in and the Yaneff affidavit only seeks to contradict the issues addressed by these. It will be up to the court to make the ultimate legal determination.",
    "[23]\nIt is objected that this is rebuttal evidence. The Wall affidavit leaves little doubt that it is. In trademark cases, rebuttal evidence is\nordinarily\nexcluded (my emphasis). But this is not a trademark case and the rule of exclusion in any event is not one of exacting finitude.",
    "[24]\nThe common law rule on rebuttal evidence is that a party's evidence in rebuttal must be limited to contradicting the opponent's case and must not be merely confirmatory of his own case in chief. A party having an affirmative burden on an issue must exhaust his evidence in the first instance and may not split his case by first relying on prima facie proof, and when this has been shaken by his adversary, adducing confirmatory evidence in reply. Nonetheless, a judge has a discretion to admit further confirmatory evidence in reply either for his own enlightenment or where the interests of justice require it: see Phipson On Evidence, (13th Ed.), paras. 33-92; Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, pp. 517-519; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.).",
    "[25]\nThe gist of the rebuttal evidence rule is thus stated in VI Wigmore On Evidence, s. 1873, at p. 672:\n\"... the usual rule will exclude\nall evidence which has not been made necessary by the opponent's case in reply\n.\"",
    "[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (N.S.), was an appeal from an assessment against the appellant's real and personal property for the year 1958. The trial judge upheld the respondent's objection to the appellant calling an expert witness on rebuttal to contradict the assessor's evidence of replacement cost that had come out on his cross-examination on the ground that this amounted to splitting the appellant's case, where the assessor was available during the trial and could have been called as the appellant's witness. The Nova Scotia Supreme Court held that this rebuttal evidence should have been admitted on the ground that the trial judge had wrongly exercised his discretion in rejecting it.",
    "[27]\nIn reaching that result Ilsley, C.J., cited the many authorities and concluded at pp. 37-38 as follows:\n\"In most of the cases cited, the fact emerging from the evidence on behalf of the defendant which the plaintiff may contradict in rebuttal is evidence of unforeseen particular facts brought out in direct examination rather than cross-examination. The facts sought to be contradicted here were unknown to the appellant. Though doubtless suspected it cannot be said that they were foreseen. True, they were brought out in cross-examination, not in direct examination; but I think that it would be unjustifiably technical to make anything depend on this distinction.\"",
    "[28]\nAdopting this reasoning and the statement of Wigmore, I find that the argument of respondent's counsel on the point of rebuttal is without merit.",
    "[29]\nFor the foregoing reasons, the applicant's motion by way of appeal is allowed, but with leave to the respondent to cross-examine on the Yaneff affidavit. Costs to be in the cause. An order will issue accordingly.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk\n[End of document]"

By the same token, the day is long past when an honest litigant can be tripped up and banished from the game merely by having taken a mistaken step in his litigation. Is it fair in the circumstances of this case that the applicant be denied leave to file the Yaneff affidavit? My answer is no.\n[22]\nIn my opinion, the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred by attaching disproportionate weight to what he conceived to be the summary nature of the proceedings and in failing to give due or any weight to the discretionary provisions of rules 704(8) and 705(2). I am also of the opinion that he misconceived the balance principle enunciated by Walsh, J., in the Ethicon case. Moreover, once the respondent opened the door to expert evidence then, as it seems to me, the door should be left ajar for entry of the Yaneff affidavit to enable the court to make a proper adjudication. I fail to see that this will work any great prejudice on the respondent. Its own expert affidavits are already in and the Yaneff affidavit only seeks to contradict the issues addressed by these. It will be up to the court to make the ultimate legal determination.\n[23]\nIt is objected that this is rebuttal evidence. The Wall affidavit leaves little doubt that it is. In trademark cases, rebuttal evidence is\nordinarily\nexcluded (my emphasis). But this is not a trademark case and the rule of exclusion in any event is not one of exacting finitude.\n[24]\nThe common law rule on rebuttal evidence is that a party's evidence in rebuttal must be limited to contradicting the opponent's case and must not be merely confirmatory of his own case in chief. A party having an affirmative burden on an issue must exhaust his evidence in the first instance and may not split his case by first relying on prima facie proof, and when this has been shaken by his adversary, adducing confirmatory evidence in reply. Nonetheless, a judge has a discretion to admit further confirmatory evidence in reply either for his own enlightenment or where the interests of justice require it: see Phipson On Evidence, (13th Ed.), paras. 33-92; Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, pp. 517-519; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.).\n[25]\nThe gist of the rebuttal evidence rule is thus stated in VI Wigmore On Evidence, s. 1873, at p. 672:\n\"... the usual rule will exclude\nall evidence which has not been made necessary by the opponent's case in reply\n.\"\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (N.S.), was an appeal from an assessment against the appellant's real and personal property for the year 1958. The trial judge upheld the respondent's objection to the appellant calling an expert witness on rebuttal to contradict the assessor's evidence of replacement cost that had come out on his cross-examination on the ground that this amounted to splitting the appellant's case, where the assessor was available during the trial and could have been called as the appellant's witness. The Nova Scotia Supreme Court held that this rebuttal evidence should have been admitted on the ground that the trial judge had wrongly exercised his discretion in rejecting it.\n[27]\nIn reaching that result Ilsley, C.J., cited the many authorities and concluded at pp. 37-38 as follows:\n\"In most of the cases cited, the fact emerging from the evidence on behalf of the defendant which the plaintiff may contradict in rebuttal is evidence of unforeseen particular facts brought out in direct examination rather than cross-examination. The facts sought to be contradicted here were unknown to the appellant. Though doubtless suspected it cannot be said that they were foreseen. True, they were brought out in cross-examination, not in direct examination; but I think that it would be unjustifiably technical to make anything depend on this distinction.\"\n[28]\nAdopting this reasoning and the statement of Wigmore, I find that the argument of respondent's counsel on the point of rebuttal is without merit.\n[29]\nFor the foregoing reasons, the applicant's motion by way of appeal is allowed, but with leave to the respondent to cross-examine on the Yaneff affidavit.

  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nMcNair, J.\n: This is a motion by the applicant pursuant to rule 336(5) appealing an order made by the Associate Senior Prothonotary on April 6, 1985. The order dismissed the applicant's motion for leave pursuant to rule 704(8) to file the affidavit of one Chris Yaneff in support of the applicant's originating notice of motion for copyright expungement. The Yaneff affidavit, sworn on December 15, 1986, was served on that date on the solicitors for the respondent, while attending at the offices of the solicitors for the applicant on their cross-examination of Donald T. Barber on his affidavit. It was pointed out to the solicitors for the applicant that they were not entitled to file the Yaneff affidavit without leave. Nevertheless, counsel for the applicant insists that the applicant's solicitors were not officially advised by the respondent's solicitors until March 30, 1987 that they were not willing to consent to the filing of the Yaneff affidavit. This prompted the notice of motion on the following day for an order for leave to file such affidavit. The Associate Senior Prothonotary gave no written reasons for dismissing the motion, nor was he bound to do so. The order indicates that he did state oral reasons for dismissing the motion.\n\n[2]\nThe respondent, Datafile, holds copyright registrations, being Nos. 333,976 and 333,977, for its alphabetic and numeric colour-coded file labelling systems. The applicant, DRG, seeks the expungement of the copyright registrations pursuant to s. 40(4)(b) of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-30 and rule 702(3) of the Federal Court Rules.\n\n[3]\nDRG's amended originating notice of motion was filed and served on June 19, 1986. Datafile entered an appearance on June 25, 1986. Applications were then made for cross-examination on affidavits. Datafile brought on a motion for leave to cross-examine DRG's affiant, Michael Black. DRG brought a motion seeking leave to file the affidavit of one Bud Korol. On October 9, 1986 orders were made by the prothonotary granting what was sought by the motions. Datafile was given leave to cross-examine Black and file its statement of defence within 30 days from the date of the order and DRG was granted leave to file the Korol affidavit with leave to Datafile to cross-examine thereon. On October 21, 1986 Black and Korol were cross-examined on their respective affidavits. DRG filed its defence to the originating notice of motion on November 7, 1986. On the same date, Datafile filed the supporting affidavits of Donald T. Barber, Denis Cliff and Karen Okada. Arrangements were made for cross-examination on these affidavits at the offices of the applicant's solicitors on December 15, 1987. The Cliff and Okada affidavits give expert opinions on the ultimate issue of whether the Datafile labels have any significant degree of artistic merit in achieving their functional purpose and result. The experts contrast the Datafile labels and the Tab labels and conclude that those of Datafile possess a higher degree of artistic merit.\n\n[4]\nIt was only on the filing of these opinion affidavits that the applicant's solicitors came to realize that DRG was left without any expert evidence. Consequently, they engaged the services of Chris Yaneff in an effort to plug the gap. Gervas W. Wall, a solicitor in the applicant's firm of solicitors, swore an affidavit on March 31, 1987 in support of the application to the Associate Senior Prothonotary for leave to file the Yaneff affidavit, in which he deposed in paragraphs 8 and 9 as follows:\n\"8. Mr. Yaneff is the only expert witness on behalf of the applicant and his affidavit would be the only one that could answer the respondent's two expert affidavits.\n\"9. I believe the respondent will not be prejudiced by the filing of this affidavit. Its two expert affidavits have already fully addressed the issues raised in Mr. Yaneff's affidavit. Further, Mr. Yaneff's affidavit was served prior to commencing cross-examination of the respondent's experts and therefore the respondent has had an opportunity to respond to all the matters raised in Mr. Yaneff's affidavit. The applicant is even prepared to consent to cross-examination on Mr. Yaneff's affidavit without the necessity of the respondent seeking leave.\"\n\n[5]\nCounsel for the applicant takes the position that the order of the prothonotary was given without written reasons whereby any appeal therefrom must of necessity proceed as a hearing de novo. In support of this submission, he cites the cases of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 317 (Ont. H.C.), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.).\n\n[6]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  which in the normal course would involve an exercise of his discretion and would generally speaking not be reviewable on appeal unless he acted unjudicially and contrary to principle and authority. As I have observed on former occasions where a judicial officer of this court makes an order without giving reasons in a matter involving the exercise of his discretion he places an appellate court in a position where it has no access to his determination and so the court appealed to must of necessity proceed de novo.\"\n\n[7]\nCounsel for the respondent contends that the matter should not be heard de novo in face of the well established principle that an appellate court will not lightly interfere with a discretionary order of a lower court unless it can be demonstrated that the lower court took an erroneous view of the facts or proceeded upon a wrong principle, or unless the appellate court is convinced that the decision represented a failure of justice. He cites in this regard  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 743 (B.C.C.A).\n\n[8] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[9]\nRule 336(5) requires that a party appealing an order or decision of a prothonotary must give a notice of appeal \"setting forth the ground of objection\". The grounds of appeal are that the prothonotary erred in law in refusing to grant leave to file the Yaneff affidavit, contrary to the principle stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The notice of appeal asked for such further or other relief as may be deemed appropriate.\n\n[10]\nCounsel for the respondent submits that the prothonotary had before him the same evidence and material presented on the appeal and had the benefit of the selfsame arguments. He contends that the prothonotary made his decision on the ground that rule 704 clearly mandates a summary procedure in proceedings of this nature that must be explicitly followed with respect to the filing of affidavits. Actually, this is the main argument of the respondent on the appeal.\n\n[11]\nCounsel for the applicant says that the prothonotary gave undue weight to rule 704 which is primarily applicable to trademark proceedings, that he failed to consider the discretionary ambit of rule 704(8), and that he erred in misapplying the Ethicon principle.\n\n[12]\nThe authority for instituting an action for expungement of copyright by way of originating notice of motion is contained in rule 702(3), which reads:\n\"702(3) Proceedings under subsection 40(4) of the Copyright Act shall be instituted by originating notice of motion or petition.\"\n\n[13]\nRule 703(3) is also relevant, providing as follows:\n\"A person served with the statement of claim or declaration, originating notice, petition or other document by which any proceeding referred to in rule 702 is commenced, except in a case to which subsection 49(10) or section 59 of the Trade Marks Act applies, who desires to oppose the granting of the relief sought shall, within 30 days after the date of service upon him, file a defence and sew e the same upon the plaintiff or applicant.\"\n\n[14]\nThe summary procedure to be followed on an originating notice of motion under s. 59 of the Trade Marks Act is set out in rule 704. Pursuant to subrule 704(3), an applicant must serve the affidavits upon which he proposes to rely within 15 days after service of the originating notice of motion. The respondent has 30 days after service of the originating notice to file and serve a reply. Under subrule 704(6), the respondent must file any affidavits which he proposes to put before the court within 30 days after service of the applicant's affidavits. By virtue of subrule 704(8), no affidavits or other material shall be filed for use in the proceedings otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this rule or by order of the court.\n\n[15]\nRule 705 states:\n\"(1) In proceedings referred to in rule 702, unless the court otherwise orders in a particular case,\n(a) no proceedings by way of discovery shall be taken; and\n(b) upon the filing of the documents authorized by rules 703 and 704, or the expiration of the time allowed therefor, the matter shall be deemed to be ready for hearing.\n\"(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the court may at any stage of the proceeding make such order or direction as seems expedient concerning the conduct of the proceedings before, after, and during the hearing thereof.\n\"(3) Except to the extent that they are inconsistent with a statutory provision or a provision made under statutory authority, or are inconsistent with rules 703 and 704 or with this rule, the other provisions of these rules, with necessary modifications and insofar as they are reasonably appropriate, are applicable to proceedings referred to in rule 702.\"\n\n[16]\nGenerally speaking, rule 704 describes a summary procedure for trademark cases whereby each party is required to file its affidavits at one time and it is only by exception that additional affidavits are permitted out of time and then only if a valid explanation has been given for the delay and it has been demonstrated that the facts contained therein are necessary to enable the court to properly adjudicate on the issue:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[17]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the court permitted the filing of two affidavits of expert opinion as to the proper French pronunciation of a word but rejected a third affidavit on matters which constituted rebuttal. This was a trademark case in which Mr. Justice Walsh went to some pains to reconcile the requirement for summary disposition with the principle that the court should have access to all relevant information. The learned judge stated the principle at p. 132:\n\"The court must strike a fine balance between on the one hand the desirability of dealing with proceedings of this nature in a summary manner without unduly extending and delaying them by permitting a multiplicity of affidavits, lengthy cross-examination on each and an extensive production of documents, and on the other hand, the desirability of making sure that the judge called upon to hear the matter on the merits of the originating notice shall have before him all information which is relevant and material to enable him to make a proper decision.\"\n\n[18]\nIt is on this point of having all relevant expert evidence before the court that counsel for the applicant primarily relies in seeking leave to file the Yaneff affidavit. He makes the further point that neither of the parties strictly adhered to the summary procedure prescribed by rule 704, pointing out that the respondent's defence and supporting affidavits were not filed until November 7, 1986. Essentially, the basic thrust of the applicant's submission is that the respondent got the benefit of a relaxation of the time limits prescribed by the rules in obtaining upwards of five months to put in its case and that the application for leave to file the Yaneff affidavit, viewed realistically in this context, asks for nothing more in the way of indulgence than that which had already been accorded to the respondent. Counsel for the applicant also points out that of the three affidavits filed by the respondent, two give expert evidence on the issue of artistic merit. He maintains that it was only on the filing of these affidavits that his client came to realize that it was left in the unfortunate position of having no expert evidence of its own to counteract the expert evidence of the respondent. Counsel for the respondent says that the applicant should have anticipated the need for expert evidence from the very outset.\n\n[19]\nUnder rule 703(3) the respondent should have filed its defence in the normal course of proceedings within 30 days after service of the amended originating notice of motion on June 19, 1986. Pursuant to rule 704(6) any affidavits proposed to be put in should have been filed within 30 days after service of the applicant's affidavits. As of June 11, 1986 the only affidavit filed by the applicant was Michael Black's. The originating notice of motion was initially set down for hearing on June 24, 1986. Counsel for the respondent requested time to prepare his client's defence and an order was made adjourning the hearing of the originating motion to a date to be fixed upon joint request. The respondent then embarked on a strategy of cross-examination on affidavits, as previously noted. Moreover, counsel for the respondent conceded in his argument on the appeal that the only period of delay relevant to the proceedings was the period from June to December, 1986.\n\n[20]\nIn my opinion, rule 704 is not a rigid code of procedure that must be strictly applied and followed in any and all circumstances, without any permitted deviation therefrom. The court has a discretion under rule 704(8) to permit the filing of further affidavits or material, where the circumstances warrant and no injustice will be occasioned thereby. One such special circumstance could be the situation where the parties themselves, as in the present case, chose to depart from the strict letter of the rule. Here, the respondent deliberately adopted the battle strategy of embarking on cross-examination on affidavits instead of proceeding to file its defence within 30 days after service of the originating motion, as required by rule 703(3). As a prelude, the respondent sought and obtained an order for late filing of its defence and affidavit evidence. Seemingly, arrangements were made by consent for cross-examination on the Barber, Cliff and Okada affidavits. Moreover, I consider that rule 704 falls short of laying down an immutable code of procedure for copyright expungement proceedings that must be read in isolated context from rules 703 and 705. It is noteworthy, in my view, that subrule 705(2) gives the court a further discretion to make such order or direction \"as seems expedient concerning the conduct of the proceedings\".\n\n[21]\nCourts are chary about relaxing the time limits imposed by the rules with respect to the various steps involved in the litigation process because of the public policy concern that there be some finality to litigation. By the same token, the day is long past when an honest litigant can be tripped up and banished from the game merely by having taken a mistaken step in his litigation. Is it fair in the circumstances of this case that the applicant be denied leave to file the Yaneff affidavit? My answer is no.\n\n[22]\nIn my opinion, the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred by attaching disproportionate weight to what he conceived to be the summary nature of the proceedings and in failing to give due or any weight to the discretionary provisions of rules 704(8) and 705(2). I am also of the opinion that he misconceived the balance principle enunciated by Walsh, J., in the Ethicon case. Moreover, once the respondent opened the door to expert evidence then, as it seems to me, the door should be left ajar for entry of the Yaneff affidavit to enable the court to make a proper adjudication. I fail to see that this will work any great prejudice on the respondent. Its own expert affidavits are already in and the Yaneff affidavit only seeks to contradict the issues addressed by these. It will be up to the court to make the ultimate legal determination.\n\n[23]\nIt is objected that this is rebuttal evidence. The Wall affidavit leaves little doubt that it is. In trademark cases, rebuttal evidence is\nordinarily\nexcluded (my emphasis). But this is not a trademark case and the rule of exclusion in any event is not one of exacting finitude.\n\n[24]\nThe common law rule on rebuttal evidence is that a party's evidence in rebuttal must be limited to contradicting the opponent's case and must not be merely confirmatory of his own case in chief. A party having an affirmative burden on an issue must exhaust his evidence in the first instance and may not split his case by first relying on prima facie proof, and when this has been shaken by his adversary, adducing confirmatory evidence in reply. Nonetheless, a judge has a discretion to admit further confirmatory evidence in reply either for his own enlightenment or where the interests of justice require it: see Phipson On Evidence, (13th Ed.), paras. 33-92; Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, pp. 517-519; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.).\n\n[25]\nThe gist of the rebuttal evidence rule is thus stated in VI Wigmore On Evidence, s. 1873, at p. 672:\n\"... the usual rule will exclude\nall evidence which has not been made necessary by the opponent's case in reply\n.\"\n\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (N.S.), was an appeal from an assessment against the appellant's real and personal property for the year 1958.
