    "[1]\nBoivin, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act], of a decision rendered by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) on October 9, 2012. In its decision, the Board held that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Act. The Board rejected the applicant's claim because he failed to establish his identity.\nFacts",
    "[2]\nThe applicant claims to be Mr. Benon Bagire, a citizen of Uganda. He claims to be homosexual, and to be at risk in Uganda because of his sexual orientation. The applicant submits that on November 24, 2010, his uncle was attacked by a mob and accused of hiding homosexual individuals. The applicant claims to have been hiding at his uncle's house along with four (4) of his friends at that time. The applicant's uncle feared for the applicant's safety and allegedly helped him leave the country (Application Record, Affidavit of Benon Bagire, p 14).",
    "[3]\nThe applicant arrived in Canada on February 28, 2011 from the United Kingdom and claimed refugee protection on arrival (Applicant's Record, p 25). The applicant travelled to Canada with Mrs. Barbara Nyiraneza. The applicant used the travel documents belonging to Mrs. Nyiraneza's son, Mr. Paul Clement Milindi. The applicant was approached by immigration officers who boarded the plane on landing, at which time he presented a blank declaration card and indicated having flushed the passport with which he travelled (Tribunal Record, p 253). However, upon searching Mrs. Nyiraneza's luggage, a Rwandan passport and a Canadian Permanent Resident Card were found, both belonging to Mr. Paul Milindi (Tribunal Record, pp 274, 320-26). A résumé for Mr. Murangira John Bosco was also found, along with a letter from a psychiatrist in Kenya recommending that Mr. Bosco join his family in Canada (Tribunal Record, pp 328-29). The applicant was also carrying a student identity card and a card from a parish, both bearing the name of Benon Bagire (Tribunal Record, p 291). The applicant was detained on arrival until August 2011, when he was released from detention on condition, among others, that he has no contact with his alleged aunt and cousin, Mrs. Nyiraneza and Mr. Milindi. The applicant was arrested in October 2011 in the company of Mr. Milindi and was further detained until February 2012 for breaching this condition (Tribunal Record, pp 282, 432-38; Applicant's Reply, para 3).",
    "[4]\nOn March 15, 2011, the parish identity card bearing the name of Benon Bagire and issued on July 11, 2010 was analyzed by the Canada Border Services Agency. The results were inconclusive. The report noted that the document contained no security features, was laminated and hand cut, and was poorly aligned overall. The utilized printing methods were commercially available and highly subject to illegitimate production. The report indicated that there were no clear indications that the hand cut laminate and excess glue were caused by intentional alterations or tampering. In the absence of other specimens or samples of this document, the results remained inconclusive (Tribunal Record, pp 188-93).",
    "[5]\nAlso on March 15, 2011, a document analysis report indicated that the analysis of a student identity card bearing the name of Benon Bagire, issued on February 20, 2009 and valid until December 31, 2010, was inconclusive. The report stated that the card contained no security features, and that in the absence of other specimens, the analysis remained inconclusive. However, the report indicated that the entire document was printed by an ink jet printer, including the issuance stamp which was meant to resemble a rubber stamp impression, and that it was of poor quality with hand cut corners and misalignments. The report stated that this document was not issued by a competent issuing authority for identity or travel, and was not acceptable as evidence of identity, nationality or any other purpose (Tribunal Record, pp 194-96).",
    "[6]\nIn April 2011, a Ugandan passport issued on April 2, 2011 and numbered B0692009 (Tribunal Record, pp 199-203; the first Ugandan passport) and a Ugandan birth certificate issued on April 20, 2001, numbered A470781 (Tribunal Record, pp 204-05), were seized from the mail by immigration officials (Tribunal Record, pp 210-12). The package was addressed to the applicant's counsel (Tribunal Record, p 206). The analysis of the passport revealed that the substrate of the document was genuine, but that it had been altered by adding a counterfeit biographical data page over the original (Tribunal Record, pp 216-17). The analysis of the birth certificate was inconclusive as the document is not a secure one, was produced on commercial grade paper and did not display any security features. It was of overall poor quality and had signs of data alteration, such as fields which were printed over and correction fluid. The examiner also commented on the birth certificate being \"tertiary\", in that it contained no biometric information allowing the document to be linked to the bearer, nor did it attest to the bearer's nationality (Tribunal Record, pp 227-28).",
    "[7]\nA copy of a Ugandan passport numbered B0883221 (the second Ugandan passport), issued on July 22, 2011 and bearing the name of Benon Bagire was analyzed on October 20, 2011 (Tribunal Record, pp 521-23). It was found to be genuine, but improperly obtained because a citizen of Uganda must present him or herself in person to apply for and pick up a Ugandan passport. At the time of issuance of this passport, the applicant was in Canada. The analysis report stated that when a passport is issued abroad, it would state the name and location of the foreign issuing office, and not Kampala, Uganda, as this passport indicates.",
    "[8]\nA letter from the Uganda High Commission, dated October 6, 2011, indicated that Mr. Benon Bagire is a Ugandan national, born in Bujumbura County, Rukungiri District of the Republic of Uganda on November 25, 1991 (Tribunal Record, p 491).",
    "[9]\nThe dates set for the hearing were as follows: July 15, 2011; October 6, 2011; December 14, 2011; and September 10, 2012.\nDecision under review",
    "[10]\nThe Board found the applicant to be neither a person in need of protection, nor a Convention refugee, because his identity could not be established, an element which is fatal to the claim.",
    "[11]\nThe Board first noted that the applicant lied to immigration officials on arrival in Canada and that he had identity documents from three (3) different people (Mr. Milindi's passport, the applicant's own alleged identity documents, as well as documents related to Mr. Bosco). Recalling that the applicant's alleged identity documents were analysed with inconclusive outcomes, the Board found that these facts led to a negative credibility inference with respect to the applicant's identity. The Board also drew a negative credibility inference on the applicant's identity from the fact that persons acting on his behalf sent a fraudulent passport (the first Ugandan passport) to his lawyer in Canada. The Board drew another negative credibility inference from the applicant's untrustworthy behaviour demonstrated by his disregard of his conditions of release after detention.",
    "[12]\nThe Board noted the applicant's testimony with regards to the second Ugandan passport, according to which he would have filled out an application form before leaving Uganda, and would have asked an aunt to pick it up for him and mail it to him. The Board rejected this explanation since, according to the evidence before it, a Ugandan passport must be applied for and picked up in person. Furthermore, the second Ugandan passport states that the applicant is a businessman, while he is actually a student. The Board dismissed the applicant's explanation according to which he would have had difficulty obtaining a passport as a student because he adduced no objective evidence supporting this allegation. The Board also noted that the signature of the bearer on the second Ugandan passport is not that of the applicant.",
    "[13]\nThe Board considered a reply to a request for information by the Ugandan authorities which states that in exceptional circumstances, a passport can be issued to a proxy who has written authorization from an applicant and a valid reason why the said applicant cannot pick up the passport in person. The Board noted that the applicant produced no such authorization even though he claimed to have given such an authorization to his aunt. The Board found the passport to have been improperly obtained, tainted, and having little probative value in establishing identity.",
    "[14]\nThe Board also took note of the fact that during the October 6, 2011 hearing, the applicant was asked whether he had other documents to support his identity such as report cards. While the applicant stated that he thought he could obtain them, at the final hearing on September 10, 2012, he still had not produced any such documents, or affidavits from his aunt or uncle in Uganda. The Board gave little weight to an email allegedly sent by the applicant's uncle and filed at the final hearing because counsel for the applicant did not address it in questions to the applicant nor in his written submissions, and because it came from a Yahoo email address and could have been sent by anyone. The Board thought that since the applicant and his counsel were able to have both Ugandan passports sent to Canada from Uganda, and since the applicant had almost a year since his first refugee hearing to adduce more evidence, they should not have had difficulty contacting individuals in Uganda in order to obtain additional evidence.",
    "[15]\nThe Board was of the opinion that the letter from the High Commission was insufficient by itself to establish the applicant's identity because it was based on the applicant's school identity card and his birth certificate (two (2) documents for which the authenticity analysis was inconclusive), and because of the fact that the applicant adduced a fraudulent Ugandan passport and an improperly obtained one was not before the Ugandan authorities. The Board recalled that the onus was on the applicant to establish his identity, and that he failed to do so. His claim was therefore rejected.\nIssue",
    "[16]\nThe only issue in the present application for judicial review is whether the Board's conclusion that the applicant failed to establish his identity was reasonable.\nStatutory provisions",
    "[17]\nSection 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act are relevant to the applicant's underlying claim for protection. However, the Board in this case did not examine the applicant's claim under these provisions, having dismissed the claim on the preliminary issue of identity. Section 106 of the Act and Rule 7 of the\nRefugee Protection Division Rules\n, SOR/2002-228, which were in force at the time of the hearing, outline the importance of adducing proper documents to establish one's identity. They read, in relevant part, as follows:\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\nPART 2\nREFUGEE PROTECTION\n...\nDivision 2\nConvention Refugees and Persons in Need of Protection\n...\nClaimant Without Identification\nCredibility\n106\n. The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\nRefugee Protection\nDivision Rules\nDocuments establishing identity and other elements of the claim\n7.\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\nPARTIE 2\nPROTECTION DES RÉFUGIÉS\n[...]\nSection 2\nRéfugiés et personnes à protéger\n[...]\nÉtrangers sans papier\nCrédibilité\n106\n. La Section de la protection des réfugiés prend en compte, s'agissant de crédibilité, le fait que, n'étant pas muni de papiers d'identité acceptables, le demandeur ne peut raisonnablement en justifier la raison et n'a pas pris les mesures voulues pour s'en procurer.\nRègles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés\nDocuments d'identité et autres éléments de la demande\n7.\nLe demandeur d'asile transmet à la Section des documents acceptables pour établir son identité et les autres éléments de sa demande. S'il ne peut le faire, il en donne la raison et indique quelles mesures il a prises pour s'en procurer.\nStandard of Review",
    "[18]\nThe standard of review to apply to the Board's findings on identity has been clearly established by the jurisprudence as that of reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 28 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 930 (QL)). Consequently, the Court will limit its review of the decision to \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\", as well as \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\nAnalysis",
    "[19]\nThe applicant argues that the Board erred by rejecting the documentation he provided to prove his identity. According to the respondent, the Board's decision was reasonable in concluding that the applicant had failed to establish his identity, a finding which is fatal to his claim.",
    "[20]\nFrom the outset, the Court agrees with the applicant that the mere fact that he travelled with a passport that was not his should not, in itself, have a negative impact on his credibility as it is not uncommon for refugee claimants to flee a country with irregular documents (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 258;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] FCJ No 560 (QL)). However, the Court also notes that the Board drew a negative inference from the fact that the applicant was dishonest with immigration officials concerning the disposal of the travel documents he used. It was reasonable for the Board to take this element into account in its analysis.",
    "[21]\nThe Court also takes note of the applicant's reliance on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 1998 CanLII 7241; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 592 (QL) at para 34, to argue that \"[I]t is an error of law to find that apparently validly issued identity documents are fraudulent if there is no evidence to establish this\". However, in the present case, there were reasons to doubt the validity of the documents submitted by the applicant.",
    "[22]\nAside from Mr. Milindi's passport and permanent resident card, the applicant also arrived in Canada with a school identity card and parish card bearing the name of Benon Bagire. The analysis on both these documents was inconclusive (Tribunal Record, pp 188-96). While identity documents issued by a foreign government are presumed to be valid ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above), the expertise on the school identity card clearly states that it is not issued by a competent issuing authority. Furthermore, there were, in this case, reasons to doubt the validity of these two (2) documents. Both documents were of overall poor quality, and the parish card showed signs of hand cutting and re-gluing. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to give them little probative weight to establish the applicant's identity.",
    "[23]\nThe first Ugandan passport which bears Benon Bagire's name was determined to be altered: while the substrate of the passport itself was genuine, the biographical data page was counterfeit (Tribunal Record, pp 216-17). Consequently, it was certainly open to the Board to reject this document as evidence of the applicant's identity. The birth certificate's authenticity analysis was inconclusive since it presented no security features and was printed on commercial grade paper. The alterations analysis was also inconclusive since the experts could not determine whether the alterations to the birth certificate (fields printed over and correction fluid) were intentional (Tribunal Record, pp 227-28). The birth certificate was also characterized as a tertiary document, as it lacked security features and basic biometric information allowing the document to be linked to the bearer. In light of this expertise report, it was open to the Board not to give much probative weight to this document.",
    "[24]\nThe Board observed that the second Ugandan passport, which was analyzed and deemed genuine, was improperly obtained. Contrary to the applicant's contention, this was not speculation on the Board's part since it had objective evidence from Ugandan authorities that passports must be applied for and picked up in person. While exceptions can be made with the authorization of a passport applicant to have someone else pick up a passport, the Board could reasonably reject this explanation from the applicant in the absence of corroborating evidence of this authorization allegedly given to his aunt. It is also noteworthy that the expert forensic report on this second Ugandan passport also concluded that it was improperly obtained (Tribunal Record, p 522). Other discrepancies with the document - namely, the name of Benon Bagire being written out and not signed, the alleged application having been made in January 2011 while the passport was only issued in July 2011 (well beyond ten (10) business days), and the occupation listed as businessman instead of student - could reasonably contribute to the Board's finding that this passport was improperly obtained and tainted.",
    "[25]\nThe applicant relied on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1158 (QL), to argue that background inconsistencies with regards to how an applicant obtained documents are insufficient to reject such documents as fraudulent if they appear authentic, referring in his case to the second Ugandan passport bearing the name of Benon Bagire.",
    "[26]\nThere are, on the face of the second Ugandan passport, reasons to doubt how it was obtained (namely, his name being written out instead of signed, the issuance date being well beyond the ten (10) business days necessary for processing, and his occupation being incorrect). While in the case of\nRu\n, above, at paragraph 53, the Board's concerns over the authenticity of the document were solely driven by its perception that fraudulent documents are easily obtained, it is not the case in the circumstances at bar. The Board in\nRu\nhad also overlooked objective evidence which strongly supported the applicant's position. In this case, the information provided by Ugandan authorities on the process for obtaining a Ugandan passport was not overlooked by the Board, and does not support the applicant's position.",
    "[27]\nThe applicant submits that the Board unreasonably gave little weight to the letter from the Ugandan High Commission. The Board stated the following at paragraph 20 of its decision:\n... First of all, Canadian forensic experts have deemed these two documents are inconclusive as to identity. Secondly, the claimant adduced a fraudulent Ugandan passport and an improperly obtained one - two salient facts which were not before Ugandan authorities. The proven ease with which one can obtain a false or even genuine, but improperly obtained, Uganda passport leads me to conclude that C-3 [the High Commission's letter] is insufficient by itself to establish the claimant's identity to my satisfaction.",
    "[28]\nHowever, the Court is of the view that it was reasonable for the Board to give little weight to the Ugandan High Commission's letter. Indeed, the Ugandan High Commission's letter is based on two (2) documents which have been found to be inconclusive. Furthermore, no evidence was provided which could lead the Court to conclude that the Ugandan High Commission examined a genuine passport or met with the applicant. The Ugandan High Commission's letter merely state that \"Benon Bagire is a Ugandan national\". However, this conclusion cannot conclusively establish, in and of itself, whether the identity of the individual before the Board was indeed Benon Bagire.",
    "[29]\nThe Court finds that, on the basis of the totality of the evidence before the Board and the lack of acceptable documentation, the Board's decision is reasonable (\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The applicant's identity has been an issue since his arrival in Canada and the onus is on him to establish it using adequate documentation. The role of the Court is not to re-weigh the evidence already considered by the Board. The Board's conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, having regard to the facts and the law (\nDunsmuir)\n.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[30]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> This Court is seized of an application for judicial review, made pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27, [the Act], of the decision of October 9, 2012 by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) ruled that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, for the purposes of sections 96 and 97 of the Act. The Board rejected the applicant's asylum application on the grounds that he had not established his identity.\nThe facts"

In its decision, the Board held that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Act. The Board rejected the applicant's claim because he failed to establish his identity.\nFacts\n[2]\nThe applicant claims to be Mr. Benon Bagire, a citizen of Uganda. He claims to be homosexual, and to be at risk in Uganda because of his sexual orientation. The applicant submits that on November 24, 2010, his uncle was attacked by a mob and accused of hiding homosexual individuals. The applicant claims to have been hiding at his uncle's house along with four (4) of his friends at that time. The applicant's uncle feared for the applicant's safety and allegedly helped him leave the country (Application Record, Affidavit of Benon Bagire, p 14).\n[3]\nThe applicant arrived in Canada on February 28, 2011 from the United Kingdom and claimed refugee protection on arrival (Applicant's Record, p 25). The applicant travelled to Canada with Mrs. Barbara Nyiraneza. The applicant used the travel documents belonging to Mrs. Nyiraneza's son, Mr. Paul Clement Milindi. The applicant was approached by immigration officers who boarded the plane on landing, at which time he presented a blank declaration card and indicated having flushed the passport with which he travelled (Tribunal Record, p 253). However, upon searching Mrs. Nyiraneza's luggage, a Rwandan passport and a Canadian Permanent Resident Card were found, both belonging to Mr. Paul Milindi (Tribunal Record, pp 274, 320-26). A résumé for Mr. Murangira John Bosco was also found, along with a letter from a psychiatrist in Kenya recommending that Mr. Bosco join his family in Canada (Tribunal Record, pp 328-29). The applicant was also carrying a student identity card and a card from a parish, both bearing the name of Benon Bagire (Tribunal Record, p 291). The applicant was detained on arrival until August 2011, when he was released from detention on condition, among others, that he has no contact with his alleged aunt and cousin, Mrs. Nyiraneza and Mr. Milindi. The applicant was arrested in October 2011 in the company of Mr. Milindi and was further detained until February 2012 for breaching this condition (Tribunal Record, pp 282, 432-38; Applicant's Reply, para 3).\n[4]\nOn March 15, 2011, the parish identity card bearing the name of Benon Bagire and issued on July 11, 2010 was analyzed by the Canada Border Services Agency. The results were inconclusive. The report noted that the document contained no security features, was laminated and hand cut, and was poorly aligned overall. The utilized printing methods were commercially available and highly subject to illegitimate production. The report indicated that there were no clear indications that the hand cut laminate and excess glue were caused by intentional alterations or tampering. In the absence of other specimens or samples of this document, the results remained inconclusive (Tribunal Record, pp 188-93).\n[5]\nAlso on March 15, 2011, a document analysis report indicated that the analysis of a student identity card bearing the name of Benon Bagire, issued on February 20, 2009 and valid until December 31, 2010, was inconclusive. The report stated that the card contained no security features, and that in the absence of other specimens, the analysis remained inconclusive. However, the report indicated that the entire document was printed by an ink jet printer, including the issuance stamp which was meant to resemble a rubber stamp impression, and that it was of poor quality with hand cut corners and misalignments. The report stated that this document was not issued by a competent issuing authority for identity or travel, and was not acceptable as evidence of identity, nationality or any other purpose (Tribunal Record, pp 194-96).\n[6]\nIn April 2011, a Ugandan passport issued on April 2, 2011 and numbered B0692009 (Tribunal Record, pp 199-203; the first Ugandan passport) and a Ugandan birth certificate issued on April 20, 2001, numbered A470781 (Tribunal Record, pp 204-05), were seized from the mail by immigration officials (Tribunal Record, pp 210-12).

It was found to be genuine, but improperly obtained because a citizen of Uganda must present him or herself in person to apply for and pick up a Ugandan passport. At the time of issuance of this passport, the applicant was in Canada. The analysis report stated that when a passport is issued abroad, it would state the name and location of the foreign issuing office, and not Kampala, Uganda, as this passport indicates.\n[8]\nA letter from the Uganda High Commission, dated October 6, 2011, indicated that Mr. Benon Bagire is a Ugandan national, born in Bujumbura County, Rukungiri District of the Republic of Uganda on November 25, 1991 (Tribunal Record, p 491).\n[9]\nThe dates set for the hearing were as follows: July 15, 2011; October 6, 2011; December 14, 2011; and September 10, 2012.\nDecision under review\n[10]\nThe Board found the applicant to be neither a person in need of protection, nor a Convention refugee, because his identity could not be established, an element which is fatal to the claim.\n[11]\nThe Board first noted that the applicant lied to immigration officials on arrival in Canada and that he had identity documents from three (3) different people (Mr. Milindi's passport, the applicant's own alleged identity documents, as well as documents related to Mr. Bosco).

However, the Board in this case did not examine the applicant's claim under these provisions, having dismissed the claim on the preliminary issue of identity. Section 106 of the Act and Rule 7 of the\nRefugee Protection Division Rules\n, SOR/2002-228, which were in force at the time of the hearing, outline the importance of adducing proper documents to establish one's identity. They read, in relevant part, as follows:\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\nPART 2\nREFUGEE PROTECTION\n...\nDivision 2\nConvention Refugees and Persons in Need of Protection\n...\nClaimant Without Identification\nCredibility\n106\n. The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\nRefugee Protection\nDivision Rules\nDocuments establishing identity and other elements of the claim\n7.\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\nPARTIE 2\nPROTECTION DES RÉFUGIÉS\n[...]\nSection 2\nRéfugiés et personnes à protéger\n[...]\nÉtrangers sans papier\nCrédibilité\n106\n. La Section de la protection des réfugiés prend en compte, s'agissant de crédibilité, le fait que, n'étant pas muni de papiers d'identité acceptables, le demandeur ne peut raisonnablement en justifier la raison et n'a pas pris les mesures voulues pour s'en procurer.\nRègles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés\nDocuments d'identité et autres éléments de la demande\n7.\nLe demandeur d'asile transmet à la Section des documents acceptables pour établir son identité et les autres éléments de sa demande. S'il ne peut le faire, il en donne la raison et indique quelles mesures il a prises pour s'en procurer.\nStandard of Review\n[18]\nThe standard of review to apply to the Board's findings on identity has been clearly established by the jurisprudence as that of reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 28 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 930 (QL)). Consequently, the Court will limit its review of the decision to \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\", as well as \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\nAnalysis\n[19]\nThe applicant argues that the Board erred by rejecting the documentation he provided to prove his identity. According to the respondent, the Board's decision was reasonable in concluding that the applicant had failed to establish his identity, a finding which is fatal to his claim.\n[20]\nFrom the outset, the Court agrees with the applicant that the mere fact that he travelled with a passport that was not his should not, in itself, have a negative impact on his credibility as it is not uncommon for refugee claimants to flee a country with irregular documents (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 258;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] FCJ No 560 (QL)). However, the Court also notes that the Board drew a negative inference from the fact that the applicant was dishonest with immigration officials concerning the disposal of the travel documents he used. It was reasonable for the Board to take this element into account in its analysis.\n[21]\nThe Court also takes note of the applicant's reliance on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 1998 CanLII 7241; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 592 (QL) at para 34, to argue that \"[I]t is an error of law to find that apparently validly issued identity documents are fraudulent if there is no evidence to establish this\". However, in the present case, there were reasons to doubt the validity of the documents submitted by the applicant.\n[22]\nAside from Mr. Milindi's passport and permanent resident card, the applicant also arrived in Canada with a school identity card and parish card bearing the name of Benon Bagire. The analysis on both these documents was inconclusive (Tribunal Record, pp 188-96). While identity documents issued by a foreign government are presumed to be valid ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above), the expertise on the school identity card clearly states that it is not issued by a competent issuing authority. Furthermore, there were, in this case, reasons to doubt the validity of these two (2) documents. Both documents were of overall poor quality, and the parish card showed signs of hand cutting and re-gluing. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to give them little probative weight to establish the applicant's identity.\n[23]\nThe first Ugandan passport which bears Benon Bagire's name was determined to be altered: while the substrate of the passport itself was genuine, the biographical data page was counterfeit (Tribunal Record, pp 216-17). Consequently, it was certainly open to the Board to reject this document as evidence of the applicant's identity. The birth certificate's authenticity analysis was inconclusive since it presented no security features and was printed on commercial grade paper. The alterations analysis was also inconclusive since the experts could not determine whether the alterations to the birth certificate (fields printed over and correction fluid) were intentional (Tribunal Record, pp 227-28). The birth certificate was also characterized as a tertiary document, as it lacked security features and basic biometric information allowing the document to be linked to the bearer. In light of this expertise report, it was open to the Board not to give much probative weight to this document.\n[24]\nThe Board observed that the second Ugandan passport, which was analyzed and deemed genuine, was improperly obtained. Contrary to the applicant's contention, this was not speculation on the Board's part since it had objective evidence from Ugandan authorities that passports must be applied for and picked up in person. While exceptions can be made with the authorization of a passport applicant to have someone else pick up a passport, the Board could reasonably reject this explanation from the applicant in the absence of corroborating evidence of this authorization allegedly given to his aunt. It is also noteworthy that the expert forensic report on this second Ugandan passport also concluded that it was improperly obtained (Tribunal Record, p 522). Other discrepancies with the document - namely, the name of Benon Bagire being written out and not signed, the alleged application having been made in January 2011 while the passport was only issued in July 2011 (well beyond ten (10) business days), and the occupation listed as businessman instead of student - could reasonably contribute to the Board's finding that this passport was improperly obtained and tainted.\n[25]\nThe applicant relied on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1158 (QL), to argue that background inconsistencies with regards to how an applicant obtained documents are insufficient to reject such documents as fraudulent if they appear authentic, referring in his case to the second Ugandan passport bearing the name of Benon Bagire.\n[26]\nThere are, on the face of the second Ugandan passport, reasons to doubt how it was obtained (namely, his name being written out instead of signed, the issuance date being well beyond the ten (10) business days necessary for processing, and his occupation being incorrect). While in the case of\nRu\n, above, at paragraph 53, the Board's concerns over the authenticity of the document were solely driven by its perception that fraudulent documents are easily obtained, it is not the case in the circumstances at bar. The Board in\nRu\nhad also overlooked objective evidence which strongly supported the applicant's position. In this case, the information provided by Ugandan authorities on the process for obtaining a Ugandan passport was not overlooked by the Board, and does not support the applicant's position.\n[27]\nThe applicant submits that the Board unreasonably gave little weight to the letter from the Ugandan High Commission. The Board stated the following at paragraph 20 of its decision:\n... First of all, Canadian forensic experts have deemed these two documents are inconclusive as to identity. Secondly, the claimant adduced a fraudulent Ugandan passport and an improperly obtained one - two salient facts which were not before Ugandan authorities. The proven ease with which one can obtain a false or even genuine, but improperly obtained, Uganda passport leads me to conclude that C-3 [the High Commission's letter] is insufficient by itself to establish the claimant's identity to my satisfaction.\n[28]\nHowever, the Court is of the view that it was reasonable for the Board to give little weight to the Ugandan High Commission's letter. Indeed, the Ugandan High Commission's letter is based on two (2) documents which have been found to be inconclusive. Furthermore, no evidence was provided which could lead the Court to conclude that the Ugandan High Commission examined a genuine passport or met with the applicant. The Ugandan High Commission's letter merely state that \"Benon Bagire is a Ugandan national\". However, this conclusion cannot conclusively establish, in and of itself, whether the identity of the individual before the Board was indeed Benon Bagire.\n[29]\nThe Court finds that, on the basis of the totality of the evidence before the Board and the lack of acceptable documentation, the Board's decision is reasonable (\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The applicant's identity has been an issue since his arrival in Canada and the onus is on him to establish it using adequate documentation. The role of the Court is not to re-weigh the evidence already considered by the Board. The Board's conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, having regard to the facts and the law (\nDunsmuir)\n.\nJUDGMENT\n[30]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, c 27, [la Loi], de la décision du 9 octobre 2012 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) a statué que le demandeur n'était ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention, ni une personne à protéger, aux fins des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi. La Commission a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur au motif qu'il n'avait pas établi son identité.\nLes faits\n[2]\nLe demandeur déclare être M. Benon Bagire, un citoyen de l'Ouganda. Il dit être homosexuel et être exposé à un risque en Ouganda en raison de son orientation sexuelle. Le demandeur soutient que, le 24 novembre 2010, son oncle a été attaqué par un groupe de personnes qui l'avaient accusé de cacher des homosexuels. Il déclare qu'il se tenait caché chez son oncle avec quatre de ses amis à ce moment-là. Craignant pour la sécurité du demandeur, son oncle l'aurait alors aidé à quitter le pays (dossier du demandeur, affidavit de Benon Bagire, page 14).\n[3]\nParvenu au Canada en provenance du Royaume-Uni le 28 février 2011, le demandeur a demandé l'asile dès son arrivée (dossier du demandeur, page 25). Le demandeur était accompagné de Mme Barbara Nyiraneza et muni de titres de voyage appartenant au fils de cette dernière, M. Paul Clement Milindi. Des agents d'immigration montés à bord de l'avion après l'atterrissage ont abordé le demandeur, qui leur a remis une carte de déclaration vierge et a déclaré qu'il avait jeté à la toilette le passeport avec lequel il voyageait (dossier du tribunal, page 253). En fouillant les bagages de Mme Nyiraneza, toutefois, on a trouvé un passeport rwandais et une carte de résident permanent du Canada qui appartenaient à M. Paul Milindi (dossier du tribunal, pages 274 et 320 à 326). On a également trouvé le curriculum vitae d'un certain Murangira John Bosco, ainsi que la lettre d'un psychiatre du Kenya recommandant que M. Bosco rejoigne les membres de sa famille au Canada (dossier du tribunal, pages 328 et 329). Le demandeur était également muni d'une carte d'identité scolaire et d'une carte de paroisse, toutes deux établies au nom de Benon Bagire (dossier du tribunal, page 291). Détenu dès son arrivée, le demandeur a été remis en liberté en août 2011, à la condition notamment de ne pas communiquer avec ses prétendus tante et cousin, Mme Nyiraneza et M. Milindi. En octobre 2011, le demandeur a été arrêté alors qu'il se trouvait avec M. Milindi; il a de nouveau été détenu, pour violation de condition de mise en liberté, jusqu'en février 2012 (dossier du tribunal, pages 282 et 432 à 438; réponse du demandeur, paragraphe 3).\n[4]\nLe 15 mars 2011, l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada a analysé la carte de paroisse établie le 11 juillet 2010 au nom de Benon Bagire. L'analyse a donné des résultats peu concluants. Selon le rapport rédigé, la carte ne comportait pas de caractéristiques de sécurité et elle était plastifiée, coupée à la main et mal cadrée de manière générale. Le mode d'impression utilisé était disponible sur le marché et fortement susceptible d'utilisation illicite. D'après le rapport, rien n'indiquait clairement si le laminage à la main et l'excès de colle étaient dus ou non à des modifications ou à des altérations intentionnelles. Faute de disposer d'autres exemplaires du document, ou d'autres modèles de ce type de document, les résultats demeuraient non concluants (dossier du tribunal, pages 188 à 193).\n[5]\nLe 15 mars 2011 également, un rapport d'analyse de document indiquait que l'analyse d'une carte d'identité scolaire établie au nom de Benon Bagire le 20 février 2009, et valide jusqu'au 31 décembre 2010, s'était avérée non concluante. On précisait dans le rapport que la carte ne comportait aucune caractéristique de sécurité et que, faute d'autres modèles, l'analyse ne pouvait donner de résultat clair. Selon le rapport, toutefois, on avait imprimé tout le document au moyen d'une imprimante à jet d'encre, y compris le timbre d'émission censé ressembler à une reproduction de tampon, et le document, mal cadré et dont les coins étaient coupés à la main, était de mauvaise qualité. Le rapport indiquait également que le document ne provenait pas d'une autorité compétente pour délivrer des pièces d'identité ou des titres de voyage, et qu'il n'était pas acceptable comme preuve, notamment, de l'identité ou de la nationalité (dossier du tribunal, pages 194 à 196).\n[6]\nEn avril 2011, des agents d'immigration ont saisi un passeport ougandais délivré le 2 avril 2011 et portant le numéro B0692009 (dossier du tribunal, pages 199 à 203; le premier passeport ougandais) ainsi qu'un certificat de naissance ougandais délivré le 20 avril 2001 et portant le numéro A470781 (dossier du tribunal, pages 204 et 205) qui avaient été transmis par la poste (dossier du tribunal, pages 210 à 212). Le destinataire de l'envoi était l'avocat du demandeur (dossier du tribunal, page 206). L'analyse du passeport a révélé que le support du document était authentique, mais qu'on l'avait modifié en ajoutant à l'original une page de données personnelles contrefaite (dossier du tribunal, pages 216 et 217). L'analyse du certificat de naissance n'était pas concluante, puisqu'il s'agissait d'un document non sécurisé, produit sur du papier de qualité commerciale et qui ne comportait aucune caractéristique de sécurité. De manière générale le document était de qualité médiocre, et il s'y trouvait des indices d'altération des données, comme des champs surimprimés et la présence de liquide correcteur. L'examinateur a également qualifié le certificat de [traduction]  tertiaire , en ce sens qu'il ne renfermait aucun renseignement biométrique permettant d'établir un lien entre le document et son titulaire, et qu'il n'attestait pas la nationalité de ce dernier (dossier du tribunal, pages 227 et 228).\n[7]\nLe 20 octobre 2011, la copie d'un passeport ougandais délivré le 22 juillet 2011 au nom de Benon Bagire et portant le numéro B0883221 (le deuxième passeport ougandais) a été analysée. On a conclu que le passeport était authentique, mais qu'il avait été obtenu irrégulièrement, puisqu'un citoyen de l'Ouganda doit se présenter en personne pour demander un passeport de son pays et aller le chercher en personne. Or, le demandeur se trouvait au Canada au moment de la délivrance du passeport. On précisait dans le rapport d'analyse que, lorsqu'un passeport est délivré à l'étranger, la désignation et l'adresse du bureau de délivrance étranger y figurent, au lieu de mentionner Kampala en Ouganda comme lieu d'origine, cette mention figurant sur le passeport en cause.\n[8]\nD'après une lettre du 6 octobre 2011 du Haut Commissariat de l'Ouganda, M. Benon Bagire est un ressortissant de l'Ouganda, né le 25 novembre 1991 dans le comté de Bujumbura, district de Rukungiri, de la République de l'Ouganda (dossier du tribunal, page 491).\n[9]\nL'audience s'est déroulée le 15 juillet 2011, le 6 octobre 2011, le 14 décembre 2011 et le 10 septembre 2012.\nDécision visée par le contrôle\n[10]\nLa Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'était ni une personne à protéger ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention parce que son identité n'avait pu être établie, cette lacune entraînant automatiquement le rejet de sa demande d'asile.\n[11]\nLa Commission a d'abord fait remarquer que le demandeur avait menti à des agents de l'immigration à son arrivée au Canada et qu'il disposait de pièces d'identité de trois personnes différentes (le passeport de M. Milindi, ses propres documents d'identité et des documents liés à M. Bosco). Rappelant aussi les résultats peu concluants de l'analyse des pièces d'identité du demandeur, la Commission a conclu que ces faits la conduisaient à tirer, à l'égard de l'identité du demandeur, une inférence défavorable quant à la crédibilité. La Commission a également tiré une pareille inférence, relativement à l'identité du demandeur, du fait que des personnes agissant pour son compte avaient envoyé un faux passeport (le premier passeport ougandais) à son avocat au Canada. Enfin, la Commission a tiré une autre inférence défavorable quant à la crédibilité en raison du comportement peu fiable dénoté par le non-respect par le demandeur des conditions de sa remise en liberté.\n[12]\nLa Commission a observé que le demandeur avait indiqué dans son témoignage quant au deuxième passeport ougandais qu'il aurait rempli un formulaire de demande avant de quitter l'Ouganda et aurait demandé à une tante d'aller le chercher pour lui et de le lui envoyer par la poste. La Commission a rejeté cette explication parce qu'en vertu de la preuve dont elle disposait, il fallait se présenter en personne pour demander un passeport ougandais et aller les chercher en personne. En outre, selon le deuxième passeport ougandais, le demandeur était un homme d'affaires, alors qu'en réalité il est étudiant. La Commission n'a pas prêté foi non plus à l'explication du demandeur selon laquelle il lui aurait été difficile d'obtenir un passeport en tant qu'étudiant parce qu'il n'avait produit aucune preuve objective étayant cette allégation. La Commission a également souligné que la signature du titulaire figurant dans le deuxième passeport ougandais n'était pas celle du demandeur.\n[13]\nLa Commission a pris en compte la réponse à une demande de renseignements fournie par les autorités ougandaises: dans certaines situations exceptionnelles, un passeport peut être délivré à un fondé de pouvoir, si le demandeur l'y a autorisé par écrit et s'il a une raison valable pour ne pas aller le chercher lui-même en personne. Toutefois, a fait remarquer la Commission, le demandeur n'a pas produit une telle autorisation même s'il a dit en avoir donnée une à sa tante. La Commission a conclu que le passeport avait été obtenu irrégulièrement, qu'il était de validité douteuse et qu'il était de faible valeur probante pour établir l'identité du demandeur.\n[14]\nLa Commission a également mentionné qu'à l'audience tenue le 6 octobre 2011, on avait demandé au demandeur s'il disposait d'autres documents, comme des bulletins de notes, pouvant aider à établir son identité. Bien que le demandeur ait déclaré qu'il pouvait obtenir pareils documents, il n'en avait toujours pas produit à l'audience finale, le 10 septembre 2012, non plus que des affidavits de sa tante ou de son oncle en Ouganda. La Commission a accordé peu d'importance à un courriel que l'oncle du demandeur aurait envoyé et qui a été déposé à l'audience finale, parce que l'avocat du demandeur n'y avait pas fait allusion lorsqu'il avait interrogé son client, pas plus que dans ses observations écrites, et parce qu'on avait recouru à une adresse de courriel Yahoo pour l'envoyer, ce qui aurait pu être fait par quiconque. La Commission a estimé que, puisque le demandeur et son avocat avaient pu se faire transmettre les deux passeports ougandais au Canada depuis l'Ouganda, et puisque le demandeur avait disposé de près d'un an depuis la première date de l'audience relative à la demande d'asile pour produire des éléments de preuve additionnels, le demandeur et son avocat n'auraient pas dû avoir de mal à communiquer avec quiconque en Ouganda afin d'obtenir des éléments de preuve supplémentaires.\n[15]\nLa Commission s'est dite d'avis que la lettre du Haut Commissariat ne permettait pas à elle seule d'établir l'identité du demandeur, étant donné que son auteur s'était fondé sur la carte d'identité scolaire et sur le certificat de naissance du demandeur (deux documents jugés non concluants au terme d'une analyse d'authenticité), et que le demandeur avait produit un faux passeport ougandais et qu'un autre obtenu irrégulièrement n'avait pas été porté à la connaissance des autorités ougandaises. La Commission a rappelé qu'il incombait au demandeur d'établir son identité et qu'il ne l'avait pas fait. Sa demande d'asile a donc été rejetée.\nQuestion en litige\n[16]\nLa seule question en litige dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est celle de savoir s'il était raisonnable pour la Commission de conclure que le demandeur n'avait pas établi son identité.\nDispositions législatives applicables\n[17]\nL'article 96 et le paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi sont pertinents quant à la demande d'asile sous-jacente du demandeur. La Commission n'a toutefois pas examiné la demande d'asile en fonction de ces dispositions en l'espèce, étant donné qu'elle l'a rejetée sur le fondement de la question préliminaire de l'identité. L'article 106 de la Loi et l'article 7 des\nRègles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/2002-228, en vigueur à la date de l'audience, font comprendre l'importance de produire les bons documents pour établir l'identité du demandeur. Voici les extraits pertinents de ces articles:\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\nPARTIE 2\nPROTECTION DES RÉFUGIÉS\n[...]\nSection 2\nRéfugiés et personnes à protéger\n[...]\nÉtrangers sans papier\nCrédibilité\n106. La Section de la protection des réfugiés prend en compte, s'agissant de crédibilité, le fait que, n'étant pas muni de papiers d'identité acceptables, le demandeur ne peut raisonnablement en justifier la raison et n'a pas pris les mesures voulues pour s'en procurer.\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\nPART 2\nREFUGEE PROTECTION\n...\nDivision 2\nConvention Refugees and Persons in Need of Protection\n...\nClaimant Without Identification\nCredibility\n106. The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\nRègles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés\nDocuments d'identité et autres éléments de la demande\n7. Le demandeur d'asile transmet à la Section des documents acceptables pour établir son identité et les autres éléments de sa demande. S'il ne peut le faire, il en donne la raison et indique quelles mesures il a prises pour s'en procurer.\nRefugee Protection\nDivision Rules\nDocuments establishing identity and other elements of the claim\n7. The claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\nNorme de contrôle\n[18]\nLa jurisprudence a clairement établi que la raisonnabilité est la norme de contrôle applicable aux conclusions de la Commission relatives à l'identité (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 28, aux paragraphes 12 et 13 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF n 930 (QL)). Par conséquent, la Cour s'en tiendra uniquement  à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit  (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\nAnalyse\n[19]\nSelon le demandeur, la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a rejeté la documentation qu'il avait fournie pour prouver son identité. Le défendeur estime, pour sa part, qu'il était raisonnable pour la Commission de conclure dans sa décision que le demandeur n'avait pas établi son identité, et que cette conclusion entraînait le rejet de la demande d'asile.\n[20]\nD'entrée de jeu, la Cour est d'accord avec le demandeur pour dire que le simple fait qu'il a voyagé muni du passeport dont il n'était pas titulaire ne devrait pas, en soi, miner sa crédibilité, puisqu'il n'est pas rare que les demandeurs d'asile n'aient pas de documents réguliers en main lorsqu'ils fuient leur pays (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 258;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] ACF n 560 (QL)). La Cour fait également remarquer que la Commission a aussi tiré une inférence défavorable du fait que le demandeur avait déclaré faussement à des agents d'immigration qu'il s'était départi de ses documents de voyage. Il était raisonnable que la Commission tienne compte de cet élément dans son analyse.\n[21]\nLa Cour prend également note du fait que le demandeur s'appuie sur les décisions\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF n 592 (QL), au paragraphe 34, pour affirmer que  [l] e fait de conclure que des documents d'identité en apparence valablement délivrés sont frauduleux constitue une erreur de droit si la preuve n'établit pas la fraude . En l'espèce, toutefois, il y avait des raisons de douter de la validité des documents soumis par le demandeur.\n[22]\nMis à part le passeport et la carte de résident permanent de M. Milindi, le demandeur est arrivé au Canada muni d'une carte d'identité scolaire et d'une carte de paroisse où figurait le nom de Benon Bagire. L'analyse des deux documents a donné des résultats peu concluants (dossier du tribunal, pages 188 à 196). Bien que les pièces d'identité délivrées par un gouvernement étranger soient présumées être valides ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée), l'expert ayant analysé la carte d'identité scolaire a déclaré sans équivoque que ce document n'avait pas été délivré par une autorité compétente. Il y avait en outre en l'espèce des raisons de douter de la validité des deux documents. Tous deux étaient de qualité médiocre, et des indices montraient qu'on avait coupé à la main puis recollé la carte de paroisse. Il était donc raisonnable que la Commission leur reconnaisse une faible valeur probante en vue d'établir l'identité du demandeur.\n[23]\nLa Commission a jugé que le premier passeport ougandais, sur lequel figurait le nom de Benon Bagire, avait été falsifié: bien que le support du passeport ait lui-même été authentique, la page de renseignements personnels avait été contrefaite (dossier du tribunal, pages 216 et 217). Il était donc assurément loisible à la Commission de rejeter ce document pour établir l'identité du demandeur. L'analyse de l'authenticité du certificat de naissance n'a pas non plus été concluante, ce document ne comportant aucune caractéristique de sécurité et ayant été imprimé sur du papier de qualité commerciale. L'analyse des modifications apportées au certificat (champs surimprimés et présence de liquide correcteur) s'est avérée elle aussi peu concluante, les experts n'ayant pu établir si elles avaient été intentionnelles (dossier du tribunal, pages 227 et 228). En outre, le certificat de naissance a été qualifié de document tertiaire parce qu'il était dénué de caractéristiques de sécurité, ainsi que de renseignements biométriques de base permettant de faire le lien entre le document et son titulaire. Compte tenu du rapport d'expert, il y avait lieu pour la Commission de ne reconnaître qu'une faible valeur probante à ce document.\n[24]\nLa Commission a souligné que le deuxième passeport ougandais, jugé authentique après analyse, avait été obtenu irrégulièrement. Ce n'était pas là pure conjecture de la part de la Commission, contrairement à ce que soutient le demandeur, étant donné qu'elle disposait à cet égard d'une preuve objective - une déclaration des autorités ougandaises selon laquelle il fallait faire en personne une demande de passeport et aller le chercher en personne. Si par exception un demandeur de passeport peut autoriser une autre personne à aller chercher son passeport, il était raisonnable que la Commission rejette l'explication donnée à cet égard par le demandeur en l'absence de toute preuve corroborant l'autorisation qu'il aurait donnée à sa tante. Il convient également de souligner que l'auteur du rapport d'expertise judiciaire sur le deuxième passeport ougandais a également conclu que ce document avait été irrégulièrement obtenu (dossier du tribunal, page 522). Il est aussi raisonnable de croire que d'autres lacunes entachant le document - le fait que le nom de Benon Bagire ait été inscrit mais que sa signature n'ait pas été apposée, la prétention selon laquelle la demande avait été présentée en janvier 2011 alors que le passeport n'a été délivré qu'en juillet 2011 (soit bien plus que dix jours ouvrables plus tard) et l'occupation d'hommes d'affaires plutôt que d'étudiant qui y était inscrite - ont pu aider la Commission à conclure que ce passeport avait été obtenu irrégulièrement et était de validité douteuse.\n[25]\nInvoquant la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF n 1158 (QL), le demandeur a soutenu que les incohérences contextuelles quant à la manière dont le demandeur a obtenu ses documents ne suffisaient pas pour que les documents, déclarés frauduleux pour ce motif, soient rejetés alors qu'ils semblent être authentiques; le demandeur faisait allusion en l'occurrence au deuxième passeport ougandais délivré au nom de Benon Bagire.\n[26]\nIl existe à la face même du deuxième passeport ougandais des raisons de mettre en question la manière dont il a été obtenu (le nom du demandeur qui y est inscrit plutôt que signé, la délivrance effectuée bien après les dix jours ouvrables requis pour le traitement d'une demande et la mention erronée de l'occupation du demandeur). Dans l'affaire\nRu\n(précitée, au paragraphe 53), la Commission doutait de l'authenticité du document en cause uniquement parce qu'elle croyait qu'il était facile de se procurer des faux documents. Or, ce n'est pas le cas en l'espèce. Dans\nRu\n, la Commission avait aussi fait abstraction d'une preuve objective qui étayait fortement les prétentions de la demanderesse. Dans la présente affaire, la Commission n'a pas fait abstraction des renseignements fournis par les autorités ougandaises sur la procédure d'obtention d'un passeport ougandais, et ces renseignements n'étayaient pas les prétentions du demandeur.\n[27]\nSelon le demandeur, la Commission a agi de manière déraisonnable en accordant peu de poids à la lettre du Haut Commissariat de l'Ouganda. La Commission a déclaré ce qui suit à ce sujet, au paragraphe 20 de sa décision:\n[...] D'abord, des experts judiciaires canadiens ont jugé ces deux documents comme étant non concluants pour ce qui est d'établir l'identité. Ensuite, le demandeur d'asile a produit un faux passeport ougandais et un autre obtenu irrégulièrement - deux faits saillants dont ne disposaient pas les autorités ougandaises. Aussi, la facilité prouvée avec laquelle une personne peut obtenir un passeport ougandais, qu'il soit faux ou encore authentique, mais obtenu irrégulièrement, me mène à conclure que la pièce C-3 [la lettre du Haut Commissariat] ne suffit pas à elle seule à établir l'identité du demandeur d'asile d'une manière que je jugerais satisfaisante.\n[28]\nLa Cour estime toutefois raisonnable que la Commission ait accordé peu de poids à la lettre du Haut Commissariat de l'Ouganda. Cette lettre s'appuyait sur deux documents jugés non concluants. De plus, aucune preuve n'a été produite qui pourrait permettre à la Cour de conclure que le Haut Commissariat a examiné un passeport authentique ou a rencontré le demandeur. Dans la lettre du Haut Commissariat, son auteur déclarait simplement: [traduction]  Benon Bagire est un ressortissant de l'Ouganda.  Cette conclusion ne permettait toutefois pas d'établir de manière concluante, à elle seule, que la personne qui a comparu devant la Commission était bien Benon Bagire.\n[29]\nLa Cour conclut, compte tenu de l'ensemble de la preuve présentée à la Commission et de l'absence de documentation acceptable, que la décision de la Commission était raisonnable (\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). L'identité du demandeur est en litige depuis qu'il est arrivé au Canada, et c'est à lui qu'il incombe d'établir cette identité au moyen de documents acceptables. La Cour n'a pas pour rôle d'apprécier de nouveau la preuve déjà examinée par la Commission. La conclusion de la Commission appartient aux issues acceptables, au regard des faits et du droit (\nDunsmuir)\n.\nJUGEMENT\n[30]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.

Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nBoivin, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act], of a decision rendered by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) on October 9, 2012. In its decision, the Board held that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Act. The Board rejected the applicant's claim because he failed to establish his identity.\nFacts\n\n[2]\nThe applicant claims to be Mr. Benon Bagire, a citizen of Uganda. He claims to be homosexual, and to be at risk in Uganda because of his sexual orientation. The applicant submits that on November 24, 2010, his uncle was attacked by a mob and accused of hiding homosexual individuals. The applicant claims to have been hiding at his uncle's house along with four (4) of his friends at that time. The applicant's uncle feared for the applicant's safety and allegedly helped him leave the country (Application Record, Affidavit of Benon Bagire, p 14).\n\n[3]\nThe applicant arrived in Canada on February 28, 2011 from the United Kingdom and claimed refugee protection on arrival (Applicant's Record, p 25). The applicant travelled to Canada with Mrs. Barbara Nyiraneza. The applicant used the travel documents belonging to Mrs. Nyiraneza's son, Mr. Paul Clement Milindi. The applicant was approached by immigration officers who boarded the plane on landing, at which time he presented a blank declaration card and indicated having flushed the passport with which he travelled (Tribunal Record, p 253). However, upon searching Mrs. Nyiraneza's luggage, a Rwandan passport and a Canadian Permanent Resident Card were found, both belonging to Mr. Paul Milindi (Tribunal Record, pp 274, 320-26). A résumé for Mr. Murangira John Bosco was also found, along with a letter from a psychiatrist in Kenya recommending that Mr. Bosco join his family in Canada (Tribunal Record, pp 328-29). The applicant was also carrying a student identity card and a card from a parish, both bearing the name of Benon Bagire (Tribunal Record, p 291). The applicant was detained on arrival until August 2011, when he was released from detention on condition, among others, that he has no contact with his alleged aunt and cousin, Mrs. Nyiraneza and Mr. Milindi. The applicant was arrested in October 2011 in the company of Mr. Milindi and was further detained until February 2012 for breaching this condition (Tribunal Record, pp 282, 432-38; Applicant's Reply, para 3).\n\n[4]\nOn March 15, 2011, the parish identity card bearing the name of Benon Bagire and issued on July 11, 2010 was analyzed by the Canada Border Services Agency. The results were inconclusive. The report noted that the document contained no security features, was laminated and hand cut, and was poorly aligned overall. The utilized printing methods were commercially available and highly subject to illegitimate production. The report indicated that there were no clear indications that the hand cut laminate and excess glue were caused by intentional alterations or tampering. In the absence of other specimens or samples of this document, the results remained inconclusive (Tribunal Record, pp 188-93).\n\n[5]\nAlso on March 15, 2011, a document analysis report indicated that the analysis of a student identity card bearing the name of Benon Bagire, issued on February 20, 2009 and valid until December 31, 2010, was inconclusive. The report stated that the card contained no security features, and that in the absence of other specimens, the analysis remained inconclusive. However, the report indicated that the entire document was printed by an ink jet printer, including the issuance stamp which was meant to resemble a rubber stamp impression, and that it was of poor quality with hand cut corners and misalignments. The report stated that this document was not issued by a competent issuing authority for identity or travel, and was not acceptable as evidence of identity, nationality or any other purpose (Tribunal Record, pp 194-96).\n\n[6]\nIn April 2011, a Ugandan passport issued on April 2, 2011 and numbered B0692009 (Tribunal Record, pp 199-203; the first Ugandan passport) and a Ugandan birth certificate issued on April 20, 2001, numbered A470781 (Tribunal Record, pp 204-05), were seized from the mail by immigration officials (Tribunal Record, pp 210-12). The package was addressed to the applicant's counsel (Tribunal Record, p 206). The analysis of the passport revealed that the substrate of the document was genuine, but that it had been altered by adding a counterfeit biographical data page over the original (Tribunal Record, pp 216-17). The analysis of the birth certificate was inconclusive as the document is not a secure one, was produced on commercial grade paper and did not display any security features. It was of overall poor quality and had signs of data alteration, such as fields which were printed over and correction fluid. The examiner also commented on the birth certificate being \"tertiary\", in that it contained no biometric information allowing the document to be linked to the bearer, nor did it attest to the bearer's nationality (Tribunal Record, pp 227-28).\n\n[7]\nA copy of a Ugandan passport numbered B0883221 (the second Ugandan passport), issued on July 22, 2011 and bearing the name of Benon Bagire was analyzed on October 20, 2011 (Tribunal Record, pp 521-23). It was found to be genuine, but improperly obtained because a citizen of Uganda must present him or herself in person to apply for and pick up a Ugandan passport. At the time of issuance of this passport, the applicant was in Canada. The analysis report stated that when a passport is issued abroad, it would state the name and location of the foreign issuing office, and not Kampala, Uganda, as this passport indicates.\n\n[8]\nA letter from the Uganda High Commission, dated October 6, 2011, indicated that Mr. Benon Bagire is a Ugandan national, born in Bujumbura County, Rukungiri District of the Republic of Uganda on November 25, 1991 (Tribunal Record, p 491).\n\n[9]\nThe dates set for the hearing were as follows: July 15, 2011; October 6, 2011; December 14, 2011; and September 10, 2012.\nDecision under review\n\n[10]\nThe Board found the applicant to be neither a person in need of protection, nor a Convention refugee, because his identity could not be established, an element which is fatal to the claim.\n\n[11]\nThe Board first noted that the applicant lied to immigration officials on arrival in Canada and that he had identity documents from three (3) different people (Mr. Milindi's passport, the applicant's own alleged identity documents, as well as documents related to Mr. Bosco). Recalling that the applicant's alleged identity documents were analysed with inconclusive outcomes, the Board found that these facts led to a negative credibility inference with respect to the applicant's identity. The Board also drew a negative credibility inference on the applicant's identity from the fact that persons acting on his behalf sent a fraudulent passport (the first Ugandan passport) to his lawyer in Canada. The Board drew another negative credibility inference from the applicant's untrustworthy behaviour demonstrated by his disregard of his conditions of release after detention.\n\n[12]\nThe Board noted the applicant's testimony with regards to the second Ugandan passport, according to which he would have filled out an application form before leaving Uganda, and would have asked an aunt to pick it up for him and mail it to him. The Board rejected this explanation since, according to the evidence before it, a Ugandan passport must be applied for and picked up in person. Furthermore, the second Ugandan passport states that the applicant is a businessman, while he is actually a student. The Board dismissed the applicant's explanation according to which he would have had difficulty obtaining a passport as a student because he adduced no objective evidence supporting this allegation. The Board also noted that the signature of the bearer on the second Ugandan passport is not that of the applicant.\n\n[13]\nThe Board considered a reply to a request for information by the Ugandan authorities which states that in exceptional circumstances, a passport can be issued to a proxy who has written authorization from an applicant and a valid reason why the said applicant cannot pick up the passport in person. The Board noted that the applicant produced no such authorization even though he claimed to have given such an authorization to his aunt. The Board found the passport to have been improperly obtained, tainted, and having little probative value in establishing identity.\n\n[14]\nThe Board also took note of the fact that during the October 6, 2011 hearing, the applicant was asked whether he had other documents to support his identity such as report cards. While the applicant stated that he thought he could obtain them, at the final hearing on September 10, 2012, he still had not produced any such documents, or affidavits from his aunt or uncle in Uganda. The Board gave little weight to an email allegedly sent by the applicant's uncle and filed at the final hearing because counsel for the applicant did not address it in questions to the applicant nor in his written submissions, and because it came from a Yahoo email address and could have been sent by anyone. The Board thought that since the applicant and his counsel were able to have both Ugandan passports sent to Canada from Uganda, and since the applicant had almost a year since his first refugee hearing to adduce more evidence, they should not have had difficulty contacting individuals in Uganda in order to obtain additional evidence.\n\n[15]\nThe Board was of the opinion that the letter from the High Commission was insufficient by itself to establish the applicant's identity because it was based on the applicant's school identity card and his birth certificate (two (2) documents for which the authenticity analysis was inconclusive), and because of the fact that the applicant adduced a fraudulent Ugandan passport and an improperly obtained one was not before the Ugandan authorities. The Board recalled that the onus was on the applicant to establish his identity, and that he failed to do so. His claim was therefore rejected.\nIssue\n\n[16]\nThe only issue in the present application for judicial review is whether the Board's conclusion that the applicant failed to establish his identity was reasonable.\nStatutory provisions\n\n[17]\nSection 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act are relevant to the applicant's underlying claim for protection. However, the Board in this case did not examine the applicant's claim under these provisions, having dismissed the claim on the preliminary issue of identity. Section 106 of the Act and Rule 7 of the\nRefugee Protection Division Rules\n, SOR/2002-228, which were in force at the time of the hearing, outline the importance of adducing proper documents to establish one's identity. They read, in relevant part, as follows:\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\nPART 2\nREFUGEE PROTECTION\n...\nDivision 2\nConvention Refugees and Persons in Need of Protection\n...\nClaimant Without Identification\nCredibility\n106\n. The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\nRefugee Protection\nDivision Rules\nDocuments establishing identity and other elements of the claim\n7.\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\nPARTIE 2\nPROTECTION DES RÉFUGIÉS\n[...]\nSection 2\nRéfugiés et personnes à protéger\n[...]\nÉtrangers sans papier\nCrédibilité\n106\n. La Section de la protection des réfugiés prend en compte, s'agissant de crédibilité, le fait que, n'étant pas muni de papiers d'identité acceptables, le demandeur ne peut raisonnablement en justifier la raison et n'a pas pris les mesures voulues pour s'en procurer.\nRègles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés\nDocuments d'identité et autres éléments de la demande\n7.\nLe demandeur d'asile transmet à la Section des documents acceptables pour établir son identité et les autres éléments de sa demande. S'il ne peut le faire, il en donne la raison et indique quelles mesures il a prises pour s'en procurer.\nStandard of Review\n\n[18]\nThe standard of review to apply to the Board's findings on identity has been clearly established by the jurisprudence as that of reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 28 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 930 (QL)). Consequently, the Court will limit its review of the decision to \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\", as well as \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\nAnalysis\n\n[19]\nThe applicant argues that the Board erred by rejecting the documentation he provided to prove his identity. According to the respondent, the Board's decision was reasonable in concluding that the applicant had failed to establish his identity, a finding which is fatal to his claim.\n\n[20]\nFrom the outset, the Court agrees with the applicant that the mere fact that he travelled with a passport that was not his should not, in itself, have a negative impact on his credibility as it is not uncommon for refugee claimants to flee a country with irregular documents (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 258;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] FCJ No 560 (QL)). However, the Court also notes that the Board drew a negative inference from the fact that the applicant was dishonest with immigration officials concerning the disposal of the travel documents he used. It was reasonable for the Board to take this element into account in its analysis.\n\n[21]\nThe Court also takes note of the applicant's reliance on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 1998 CanLII 7241; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 592 (QL) at para 34, to argue that \"[I]t is an error of law to find that apparently validly issued identity documents are fraudulent if there is no evidence to establish this\". However, in the present case, there were reasons to doubt the validity of the documents submitted by the applicant.\n\n[22]\nAside from Mr. Milindi's passport and permanent resident card, the applicant also arrived in Canada with a school identity card and parish card bearing the name of Benon Bagire. The analysis on both these documents was inconclusive (Tribunal Record, pp 188-96). While identity documents issued by a foreign government are presumed to be valid ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above), the expertise on the school identity card clearly states that it is not issued by a competent issuing authority. Furthermore, there were, in this case, reasons to doubt the validity of these two (2) documents. Both documents were of overall poor quality, and the parish card showed signs of hand cutting and re-gluing. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to give them little probative weight to establish the applicant's identity.\n\n[23]\nThe first Ugandan passport which bears Benon Bagire's name was determined to be altered: while the substrate of the passport itself was genuine, the biographical data page was counterfeit (Tribunal Record, pp 216-17). Consequently, it was certainly open to the Board to reject this document as evidence of the applicant's identity. The birth certificate's authenticity analysis was inconclusive since it presented no security features and was printed on commercial grade paper. The alterations analysis was also inconclusive since the experts could not determine whether the alterations to the birth certificate (fields printed over and correction fluid) were intentional (Tribunal Record, pp 227-28). The birth certificate was also characterized as a tertiary document, as it lacked security features and basic biometric information allowing the document to be linked to the bearer. In light of this expertise report, it was open to the Board not to give much probative weight to this document.\n\n[24]\nThe Board observed that the second Ugandan passport, which was analyzed and deemed genuine, was improperly obtained. Contrary to the applicant's contention, this was not speculation on the Board's part since it had objective evidence from Ugandan authorities that passports must be applied for and picked up in person. While exceptions can be made with the authorization of a passport applicant to have someone else pick up a passport, the Board could reasonably reject this explanation from the applicant in the absence of corroborating evidence of this authorization allegedly given to his aunt. It is also noteworthy that the expert forensic report on this second Ugandan passport also concluded that it was improperly obtained (Tribunal Record, p 522). Other discrepancies with the document - namely, the name of Benon Bagire being written out and not signed, the alleged application having been made in January 2011 while the passport was only issued in July 2011 (well beyond ten (10) business days), and the occupation listed as businessman instead of student - could reasonably contribute to the Board's finding that this passport was improperly obtained and tainted.\n\n[25]\nThe applicant relied on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1158 (QL), to argue that background inconsistencies with regards to how an applicant obtained documents are insufficient to reject such documents as fraudulent if they appear authentic, referring in his case to the second Ugandan passport bearing the name of Benon Bagire.\n\n[26]\nThere are, on the face of the second Ugandan passport, reasons to doubt how it was obtained (namely, his name being written out instead of signed, the issuance date being well beyond the ten (10) business days necessary for processing, and his occupation being incorrect). While in the case of\nRu\n, above, at paragraph 53, the Board's concerns over the authenticity of the document were solely driven by its perception that fraudulent documents are easily obtained, it is not the case in the circumstances at bar. The Board in\nRu\nhad also overlooked objective evidence which strongly supported the applicant's position. In this case, the information provided by Ugandan authorities on the process for obtaining a Ugandan passport was not overlooked by the Board, and does not support the applicant's position.\n\n[27]\nThe applicant submits that the Board unreasonably gave little weight to the letter from the Ugandan High Commission. The Board stated the following at paragraph 20 of its decision:\n... First of all, Canadian forensic experts have deemed these two documents are inconclusive as to identity. Secondly, the claimant adduced a fraudulent Ugandan passport and an improperly obtained one - two salient facts which were not before Ugandan authorities. The proven ease with which one can obtain a false or even genuine, but improperly obtained, Uganda passport leads me to conclude that C-3 [the High Commission's letter] is insufficient by itself to establish the claimant's identity to my satisfaction.\n\n[28]\nHowever, the Court is of the view that it was reasonable for the Board to give little weight to the Ugandan High Commission's letter. Indeed, the Ugandan High Commission's letter is based on two (2) documents which have been found to be inconclusive. Furthermore, no evidence was provided which could lead the Court to conclude that the Ugandan High Commission examined a genuine passport or met with the applicant. The Ugandan High Commission's letter merely state that \"Benon Bagire is a Ugandan national\". However, this conclusion cannot conclusively establish, in and of itself, whether the identity of the individual before the Board was indeed Benon Bagire.\n\n[29]\nThe Court finds that, on the basis of the totality of the evidence before the Board and the lack of acceptable documentation, the Board's decision is reasonable (\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The applicant's identity has been an issue since his arrival in Canada and the onus is on him to establish it using adequate documentation. The role of the Court is not to re-weigh the evidence already considered by the Board. The Board's conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, having regard to the facts and the law (\nDunsmuir)\n.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[30]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> This Court is seized of an application for judicial review, made pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27, [the Act], of the decision of October 9, 2012 by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) ruled that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, for the purposes of sections 96 and 97 of the Act. The Board rejected the applicant's asylum application on the grounds that he had not established his identity.\nThe facts",
