    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC)\nMLB unedited judgment\n[French language version follows English language version]\n[La version française vient à la suite de la version anglaise]\nChristopher Brazeau and Bradley Rogers and Harvey Andres and Ernest Meigs and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 1300)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nHughes, J.\nNovember 7, 2012.\nCounsel:\nSelf-represented, for the plaintiffs (On Their Own Behalf);\nMarcia Jackson, for the defendant.\nSolicitors of Record:\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the defendant.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nHughes, J.\n: The Defendant, Her Majesty the Queen, has brought a motion to strike the Statement of Claim in this action as filed on June 13, 2012 and for other relief. For the reasons that follow, I am ordering that the action is to be stayed for six (6) months on certain conditions.",
    "[2]\nThe Plaintiffs, as enumerated in the Statement of Claim filed June 13, 2012, are all prisoners in a federal penitentiary located in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. They claim damages in excess of fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars as against the Defendant for, as described in paragraph 1 of that Claim:\n negligence\n negligent infliction of nervous shock\n intentional infliction of nervous shock\n misfeasance in Public Office\n breach of sections 7, 8, 9, 12 and 15(1) of the Charter",
    "[3]\nIn addition, they claim aggravated and exemplary damages, costs on a lawyer/client basis, and other relief.",
    "[4]\nThe first named Plaintiff, Christopher Brazeau, describes himself in paragraph 2 of the Claim as \"Plaintiff in lead\". None of the Plaintiffs describe themselves as lawyers entitled to practise law in any of Canada's provinces or territories. Each of the Plaintiffs has personally signed the Statement of Claim. In the materials filed in the Court record, such as the Plaintiff's submissions on this motion, the Plaintiff Brazeau appears to be acting as the spokesman for all Plaintiffs.",
    "[5]\nIn response to the Defendant's original motion to strike, the Plaintiffs filed a response, together with a document entitled \"Amended Statement of Claim etc\".This document was not filed as a separate document purporting to amend the original Statement of Claim. This document purports to add two further Plaintiffs and to provide further particulars beyond that which was set out in the original Statement of Claim. In the meantime, Justice Snider of this Court has given an Order, together with Reasons (cited as 2012 FC 648), in another action, T-1543-11, involving the same person, Christopher Brazeau, as Plaintiff, and the Attorney General of Canada. Her Order dealt with a motion to strike brought by the Attorney General.",
    "[6]\nAs a result, I gave a Direction requesting that the Defendant in the present action provide an amended argument dealing with Justice Snider's Reasons and the purported amendments to the Statement of Claim in this action. The Defendant has now provided an Amended Motion Record. The Plaintiffs, through the Plaintiff Brazeau, have provided an Amended Record in response. I will deal with the motion, principally having regard to these documents; but I also have in mind the earlier documents provided in the record.",
    "[7]\nI start with noting that none of the Plaintiffs are lawyers. At paragraph 6 of their Memorandum of Argument, they state that they \"...are not legally trained and must prepare and argue their case without the assistance/advice of counsel ...\". Nonetheless, a reading of the Claim and other materials provided by the Plaintiffs demonstrates that considerable time and effort has been expended by one or more of them in conducting some sort of legal research into the matter. Therein lies one of the problems encountered by self-represented litigants such as the Plaintiffs. Legal training involves more than just reading materials and copying from precedents. It requires a thorough knowledge of the law and how it is practised, and the exercise of experienced judgment in determining, for instance, whether a claim should be made to the Courts or to some other person or tribunal; how that claim fits within the principles of law; and how that claim is to be set forth properly in the relevant documents in which a claim is submitted. While many people can wield a knife, not all are surgeons. While many people can read Rules of Practice and legal texts, not all are barristers or solicitors. It takes not only knowledge, but thorough knowledge, exercised through experienced judgment to get it right.",
    "[8]\nI have no information as to whether the Plaintiffs sought legal advice and failed to obtain it, for financial reasons or otherwise. Nor do I have any information as to whether the Plaintiffs did secure legal advice and chose not to follow it.",
    "[9]\nThe Plaintiffs' circumstances are described by themselves in paragraph 17 of their Amended Statement of Claim:\n17. The awkward, damaging positions and uncomfortable extremes of the Plaintiffs Detention is inflicting extreme stress and nervous shock by inter alia\n:\n(a) being unable to understand, control or offset the effects or impositions;\n(b) having to self deaden in order to cope, which in turn;\n(c) diminishes ability and capacity to bear desire, feel/express emotions including the ability/desire to;\n(d) express and/or enjoy mutuality, connectivity and meaning making;\n(e) sleep deprivation\n(f) being unable to express and/or realize my rights\n(g) constantly being overwhelmed with hopelessness and erosion of self worth/value\n(h) loosing control over my ability to tolerate my circumstances and maintain my composure/sanity at the same time;\n(i) constantly worrying and fearing over the longevity and extent these effects will have on my life, personality and future;\n(j) feeling constant and incessant\nsubtle anger over being unable to make fundamental and critical life choices;\n(k)\nall of which resemble the symptoms associated with Morbid Depression, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Order, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\n(l)\nother, not limited by the foregoing which has occured both during and subsequent to the conduct of the Defendant",
    "[10]\nHere we see expressions of anger, hopelessness, diminished capacity and losing control. One is reminded of a quotation ascribed to Gautama Buddha, \"Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned\". Similarly, one can cite Greeks such as Sophocles and Seneca \"Whom god wishes to destroy, he first makes mad.\"",
    "[11]\nIn viewing the Statement of Claim and Amended Statement of Claim, the Court can clearly grasp that the Plaintiffs are unhappy to the point of frustration, distraction and despair, with the circumstances of their imprisonment. Whether this is a normal and expected consequence of that imprisonment or whether their circumstances have gone beyond those prescribed by the laws of Canada, is not sufficiently clear from the pleadings, even those as amended. What the pleadings do set forth are conclusions. What they must set forth are:\n the precise circumstances at issue: the who, what, when and where relevant events leading to the complaint took place\n the resulting effect\n the standard required by law\n the manner in which those circumstances failed to live up to the standards required by law\n what harm resulted",
    "[12]\nThe Rules of this Court, including Rule 174, require a pleading to contain a concise statement of the material facts. Simply to conclude, for example, that barber services were not provided, or that library services were inadequate; or that access to sunlight was not provided, is insufficient. What happened, when, and where; who was involved must be clearly and precisely set out. What is the standard required by law? How did the Defendant's servants fall short of that standard? All of this is required of a proper pleading.",
    "[13]\nShould the Court be involved at this time? There are more appropriate resources through which anger and frustration can be worked out. There are resources through which inadequate services can be identified and redressed. These include mediation and grievance procedures. The Plaintiffs in their amended Record, paragraph 17, set out a long list of reference numbers, presumably identifying grievance procedures that have been initiated. While in some circumstances, the Court has permitted an action to proceed notwithstanding the availability or pursuit of a grievance process, the more usual and more desirable procedure is that a proper grievance or grievances should be fairly pursued and determined before the Court is asked to address the situation.",
    "[14]\nAccordingly, the Court concludes in respect of the pleadings, including the draft amended Statement of Claim:\na) the Statement of Claim is inadequate; it fails to set out the specific factual circumstances giving rise to a claim; it fails to set out the standard required; it fails to set out how and in what respect the Defendant's officers failed to meet that standard;\nb) the Statement of Claim, however, is not so inadequate that leave to amend should be denied;\nc) no party can be added by simply filing an amended Claim; leave of the Court must be sought;\nd) the Plaintiffs should seek competent legal representation;\ne) the parties should calmly act in good faith and follow appropriate mediation and grievance procedures before seeking the assistance of the Court.\nORDER",
    "[15]\nACCORDINGLY,\nI will stay the present action for a period of six (6) months so as to permit:\n1. The Plaintiffs to secure competent legal counsel. If they cannot do so, they shall advise the Court within five (5) months as to the difficulties experienced and why they are unable to do so.\n2. Defendant's Counsel shall, within two (2) months, advise the Plaintiffs and the Court as to competent legal services that may be available to the Plaintiffs, including Legal Aid,\npro bono\nservices, and otherwise.\n3. The parties shall advise on or before the expiration of six (6) months as to the status of any grievance procedure or procedures taken.\n4. The parties shall advise on or before the expiry of six (6) months as to any mediation process(es) undertaken, and efforts undertaken as between themselves to discuss and resolve their disputes.\n5. Upon receipt of the foregoing, the Court shall provide direction as to procedures to be followed in the present action.\n6. Costs are reserved.\n.........................\nChristopher Brazeau and Bradley Rogers and Harvey Andres and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Reine, filed a motion seeking the expungement of the declaration filed on June 13, 2012, in this action, as well as various other relief. For the reasons set out below, the Court will order that the action be suspended for six (6) months, under certain conditions. [2]\nThe applicants, as listed in the declaration filed on June 13, 2012, are all inmates of the federal penitentiary in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. They claim damages of more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) from the defendant, claiming, according to the description in paragraph 1 of the declaration in question:\n negligence\n the infliction, through negligence, of nervous shocks\n the deliberate infliction of nervous shock\n misconduct in the performance of official duties\n violation of sections 7, 8, 9 and 12 as well as subsection 15(1) of the Charter [3]\nThey further seek aggravated and punitive damages, attorney-client costs, and various other relief. [4]\nThe first of the listed plaintiffs, Christopher Brazeau, identifies himself, in paragraph 2 of the statement of claim, as lead plaintiff. None of the applicants hold themselves out as lawyers admitted to practice in any territory or province of Canada. The applicants all signed the declaration. In the documents filed in the Court file, including in the applicant's observations regarding this motion, the applicant Brazeau appears to act as a spokesperson for all of the applicants. [5]\nFollowing the motion to strike initially filed by the defendant, the plaintiffs filed a response, accompanied by a document entitled Amended Declaration, etc.  This document was not filed as a separate document to amend the statement originally filed. This document purports to join two plaintiffs to the action, and to provide additional details beyond what was contained in the initial statement. In the meantime, Justice Snider, on behalf of the Court, issued a reasoned order (reference: 2012 FC 648), in the context of file T-1543-11, another action brought by the same plaintiff, Christopher Brazeau, against the Attorney General of Canada. Judge Snider's order addressed a motion to expunge filed by the Attorney General. [6]\nThat being so, I have issued a direction requiring the respondent in this case to submit an amended argument regarding Judge Snider's reasons and the changes that purported to have been made to the statement in this case. The defendant has since submitted an amended motion brief. The plaintiffs, through plaintiff Brazeau, responded by filing an amended filing. I will now rule on the request, primarily in light of these documents, but I also intend to take into account the documents previously placed on file. [7]\nRemember that none of the plaintiffs are lawyers. In paragraph 6 of their Statement of Case, they specify that they ... have no legal training, and therefore must prepare and defend their case without the assistance or advice of a lawyer ... . It appears, however, from the declaration and other documents filed by the plaintiffs, that one or more of them have devoted considerable time and effort to the study of the questions of law raised in this case. This is one of the problems experienced by litigants who, like plaintiffs, represent themselves in court. Legal training does not, in fact, rely solely on reading documents and researching precedents. Such training also requires in-depth knowledge of law and its practice, as well as a capacity for reflection based on experience and enabling, for example, to know whether an application should be brought before the Court, or before some other authority. It is also a question of knowing precisely where the request fits among the applicable legal principles, and how to formulate it correctly in the necessary documents. Many people know how to use a knife, but that does not make them surgeons. Many people can read procedural rules and legal texts, but not all of them are lawyers. Doing things right requires not just knowledge, but in-depth knowledge applied with the discernment that experience brings. [8]\nI do not know whether, for financial or other reasons, the plaintiffs attempted unsuccessfully to retain counsel. I also can't know if they actually had the benefit of legal advice but decided not to follow it. [9]\nHere is how, in paragraph 17 of their amended statement of claim, the applicants describe the situation in which they find themselves:\n[translation]\n17. The inconvenient and harmful positions, and the extreme discomfort that their detention imposes on the applicants, inflict extreme stress and nervous shock on them, in particular because:\na) they are unable to understand, control or compensate for the consequences of what is imposed on them;\nb) to cope with the situation, they have to close themselves off, which leads to;\nc) an attack on their ability and capacity to desire, experience and express their emotions including the capacity and desire to:\nd) express and experience feelings of mutuality, connectedness and meaning;\ne) sleep deprivation;\nf) an inability to express and/or realize my rights;\ng) constantly overwhelmed by despair and a progressive deterioration of self-esteem and self-esteem;\nh) loss of control over my ability to tolerate the situation I find myself in and, at the same time, maintain my composure and not go crazy;\ni) constant worry and fear about the duration and scope of the effects that all of this will have on my life, on my personality and on my future;\nj) the constant and incessant feeling\nof a subtle anger born from the fact that I do not have the means to make the fundamental and essential choices of existence\n;\nk)\nall these correspond to the symptoms of morbid depression, antisocial personality disorders, obsessive-compulsive neurosis and post-traumatic stress disorder\n;\nl)\nother disorders which manifested themselves during the defendant's behavior, or which followed it\n. [10]\nWe are faced with the expression of feelings of anger, despair, diminished abilities and loss of control. This reminds us of the words attributed to the Buddha: Clinging to one's anger is like grabbing a burning ember with the intention of throwing it at someone; it's you who gets burned.  In a similar vein, we could cite Greek authors, such as Sophocles and Seneca, who say that those whom the gods want to destroy, they first make mad. [11]\nReading the declaration and the amended declaration, the Court clearly understands that the discontent and frustration that their conditions of detention inspire in the detainees push them to despair and lose their minds. The procedural documents, even as amended, do not allow us to say whether this situation is the normal and expected consequence of their incarceration, or whether it goes beyond what is prescribed by Canadian law. What the declaration contains are observations, whereas it should state:\n the precise circumstances of this case: that is, in relation to the events giving rise to the statement in this case, who did what, when and where;\n the repercussions this had;\n the standard that the law imposes;\n how the circumstances in question violate the standards prescribed by law;\n the resulting harm. [12]\nAccording to the Rules of Court, in particular article 174, every procedural document must contain a concise statement of the material facts. It is not enough, for example, to conclude that one does not have access to the services of a hairdresser, that library services are insufficient or that one is deprived of sunlight. It is appropriate, in fact, to explain clearly and precisely what happened, when it happened and where. What is the standard prescribed by law? To what extent did the defendant's agents fail to meet this standard? All this must be described in an appropriate procedural document. [13]\nShould the Court intervene at this time? There are better avenues for expressing such feelings of anger and frustration. There are remedies available to identify and correct deficiencies in services. These include mediation and grievance mechanisms. In their amended case, in paragraph 17, the applicants set out a long list of reference numbers, presumably corresponding to the grievance procedures they have initiated. While the Court has, in some cases, allowed an action despite the existence of a grievance procedure, it is, before bringing a case before the Court, customary and desirable to file a grievance and wait for it to be decided. [14]\nTherefore, the Court concludes, with respect to the pleadings, including the draft amended declaration that:\n(a) the statement is inadequate because it does not specifically state the precise factual circumstances giving rise to the request; it does not state the applicable standard; it does not explain how and in what way the defendant's agents failed to meet this standard;\n(b) the declaration is not, however, so inadequate that authorization to amend it should be refused;\n(c) a party cannot be joined to the action simply by filing an amended application; To do this, it is necessary to seek authorization from the Court;\n(d) applicants should be represented by a lawyer;\n(e) the parties should act calmly and in good faith and, before approaching the Court, exhaust mediation and grievance procedures.\nORDER [15]\nCONSEQUENTLY,\nthis proceeding is suspended for a period of six (6) months so that:\n1. the applicants retain the services of an attorney. If they are unable to do so, they must, within five (5) months, bring to the attention of the Court the difficulties they are experiencing and the reasons why they are unable to retain the services of a lawyer;\n2. the defendant's lawyer must, within two (2) months, inform the plaintiffs and the Court of the legal services that the plaintiffs could benefit from, including legal aid, the services of a pro bono lawyer or otherwise;\n3. before the expiration of this six (6) month period, the parties will inform the Court of the status of the grievance settlement procedures initiated;\n4. at the latest at the end of this six (6) month period, the parties will inform the Court of the status of the mediation procedures initiated as well as the efforts undertaken to discuss the disputes between them in order to resolve them;\n5. upon receipt of this information, the Court will give directions as to the procedure to be followed in these proceedings;\n6. the question of costs will be decided later.\n[End of document]"

For the reasons that follow, I am ordering that the action is to be stayed for six (6) months on certain conditions.\n[2]\nThe Plaintiffs, as enumerated in the Statement of Claim filed June 13, 2012, are all prisoners in a federal penitentiary located in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. They claim damages in excess of fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars as against the Defendant for, as described in paragraph 1 of that Claim:\n negligence\n negligent infliction of nervous shock\n intentional infliction of nervous shock\n misfeasance in Public Office\n breach of sections 7, 8, 9, 12 and 15(1) of the Charter\n[3]\nIn addition, they claim aggravated and exemplary damages, costs on a lawyer/client basis, and other relief.\n[4]\nThe first named Plaintiff, Christopher Brazeau, describes himself in paragraph 2 of the Claim as \"Plaintiff in lead\".

Pour les motifs ci-dessous exposés, la Cour va ordonner que l'action soit suspendue pour six (6) mois, et ce, à certaines conditions.\n[2]\nLes demandeurs, selon l'énumération faite dans la déclaration déposée le 13 juin 2012, sont tous des détenus de l'établissement pénitentiaire fédéral de Prince Albert, en Saskatchewan. Ils réclament à la défenderesse des dommages-intérêts de plus de cinquante mille dollars (50 000 $) invoquant, selon la description figurant au paragraphe 1 de la déclaration en question:\n la négligence\n l'infliction, par négligence, de chocs nerveux\n l'infliction délibérée de chocs nerveux\n des fautes dans l'exercice de fonctions officielles\n la violation des articles 7, 8, 9 et 12 ainsi que du paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte\n[3]\nIls réclament en outre des dommages-intérêts majorés et punitifs, les dépens avocat-client, et diverses autres mesures de redressement.\n[4]\nLe premier parmi les demandeurs énumérés, Christopher Brazeau, se présente, au paragraphe 2 de la déclaration, comme [traduction]  demandeur principal . Aucun des demandeurs ne se présente comme avocat admis à exercer dans un territoire ou une province du Canada. Les demandeurs ont tous signé la déclaration. Dans les documents versés au dossier de la Cour, y compris dans les observations du demandeur concernant la présente requête, le demandeur Brazeau semble agir en tant que porte-parole de l'ensemble des demandeurs.\n[5]\nÀ la suite de la requête en radiation initialement déposée par la défenderesse, les demandeurs ont déposé une réponse, accompagnée d'un document intitulé [traduction]  Déclaration modifiée, etc.  Ce document n'a pas été déposé à titre de document distinct visant à modifier la déclaration déposée initialement. Ce document prétend joindre deux demandeurs à l'action, et fournir des détails supplémentaires au-delà de ce que contenait la déclaration initiale. Entre-temps, la juge Snider a, au nom de la Cour, rendu une ordonnance motivée (référence: 2012 CF 648), dans le cadre du dossier T-1543-11, une autre action introduite par le même demandeur, Christopher Brazeau, contre le procureur général du Canada. L'ordonnance de la juge Snider traitait d'une requête en radiation présentée par le procureur général.\n[6]\nCela étant, j'ai donné une directive demandant à la défenderesse en l'espèce de remettre une argumentation modifiée au sujet des motifs de la juge Snider et des modifications qui sont censées avoir été apportées à la déclaration en l'espèce. La défenderesse a depuis remis un dossier de requête modifié. Les demandeurs, par l'entremise du demandeur Brazeau, ont, en réponse, déposé un dossier modifié. Je vais maintenant me prononcer sur la requête, essentiellement au vu de ces documents, mais j'entends également prendre en compte les documents versés auparavant au dossier.\n[7]\nRappelons qu'aucun des demandeurs n'est avocat. Au paragraphe 6 de leur exposé des arguments, ils précisent qu'ils [traduction]  [...] n'ont aucune formation juridique, et doivent par conséquent préparer et soutenir leur cause sans l'aide ou les conseils d'un avocat [...] . Il ressort, cependant, de la déclaration et des autres documents déposés par les demandeurs, que l'un ou plusieurs d'entre eux ont consacré un temps et des efforts considérables à l'étude des questions de droit soulevées en l'espèce. C'est un des problèmes éprouvés par les plaideurs qui, comme les demandeurs, se représentent eux-mêmes en justice. Une formation juridique ne repose pas, en effet, seulement sur la lecture de documents et la recherche de précédents. Une telle formation exige en outre une connaissance approfondie du droit et de son exercice, ainsi qu'une capacité de réflexion fondée sur l'expérience et permettant, par exemple, de savoir si une demande doit être portée devant la Cour, ou devant quelque autre instance. Il s'agit, par ailleurs, de savoir précisément où la demande s'insère parmi les principes de droit applicables, et comment la formuler correctement dans les documents nécessaires. Nombreux sont ceux qui savent se servir d'un couteau, mais cela n'en fait pas des chirurgiens. Bien des gens peuvent prendre connaissance des règles de procédure et des textes juridiques, mais ils ne sont pas tous des avocats. Pour faire les choses correctement, il faut non seulement des connaissances, mais des connaissances approfondies appliquées avec le discernement qu'apporte l'expérience.\n[8]\nJe ne sais pas si, pour des raisons financières ou autres, les demandeurs ont tenté en vain de retenir les services d'un avocat. Je ne peux pas savoir non plus s'ils ont en fait bénéficié des conseils d'un avocat, mais ont décidé de ne pas les suivre.\n[9]\nVoici en quels termes, au paragraphe 17 de leur déclaration modifiée, les demandeurs désignent la situation dans laquelle ils se trouvent:\n[traduction]\n17. Les positions incommodes et dommageables, et l'extrême inconfort que leur détention impose aux demandeurs leur infligent un stress extrême et des chocs nerveux, notamment parce que:\na) ils sont dans l'incapacité de comprendre, de contrôler ou de compenser les conséquences de ce qu'on leur impose;\nb) il leur faut, pour faire face à la situation, se fermer à eux-mêmes, ce qui entraîne;\nc) une atteinte à leur aptitude et capacité de désirer, d'éprouver et d'exprimer leurs émotions y compris la capacité et le désir de:\nd) exprimer et éprouver des sentiments de mutualité, de connectivité et de signification;\ne) une privation de sommeil;\nf) une incapacité à exprimer et/ou à réaliser mes droits;\ng) constamment accablé par le désespoir et une détérioration progressive de l'amour propre et de l'estime de soi;\nh) perte de contrôle quant à ma capacité de tolérer la situation dans laquelle je me trouve et, en même temps, de conserver mon sang-froid et de ne pas devenir fou;\ni) une inquiétude et une crainte constantes quant à la durée et la portée des effets que tout cela va avoir sur ma vie, sur ma personnalité et sur mon avenir;\nj) le sentiment constant et incessant\nd'une subtile colère née du fait que je n'ai pas les moyens d'effectuer les choix fondamentaux et essentiels de l'existence\n;\nk)\ntout cela correspond aux symptômes d'une dépression morbide, de troubles de la personnalité antisociale, de la névrose obsessionnelle compulsive et d'un état de stress post-traumatique\n;\nl)\nd'autres troubles qui se sont manifestés à l'occasion du comportement de la défenderesse, ou qui y font suite\n.\n[10]\nNous sommes face à l'expression de sentiments de colère, de désespoir, d'amoindrissement des capacités et d'une perte de contrôle. Cela nous remet en mémoire des paroles attribuées au Bouddha: [traduction]  Se raccrocher à sa colère, c'est comme saisir une braise ardente dans le but de la jeter sur quelqu'un; c'est vous qui vous brûlez.  On pourrait, dans un même ordre d'idées, citer des auteurs grecs, tels que Sophocle et Sénèque, selon qui [traduction]  [c] eux que les dieux veulent détruire, ils les rendent d'abord fous .\n[11]\nÀ la lecture de la déclaration et de la déclaration modifiée, la Cour saisit clairement que le mécontentement et la frustration que leurs conditions de détention inspirent aux détenus les poussent à désespérer et à perdre la tête. Les actes de procédure, même tels que modifiés, ne permettent pas de dire si cette situation est la conséquence normale et attendue de leur incarcération, ou si cela dépasse ce que prescrit la loi canadienne. Ce que contient la déclaration, ce sont des observations, alors qu'il faudrait qu'on y expose:\n les circonstances précises de cette affaire: c'est-à-dire, en ce qui concerne les événements à l'origine de la déclaration en l'espèce, qui a fait quoi, quand et où;\n les répercussions que cela a eues;\n la norme que la loi impose;\n en quoi les circonstances en question enfreignent les normes prescrites par la loi;\n le préjudice qui en a résulté.\n[12]\nSelon les Règles de la Cour, notamment l'article 174, tout acte de procédure doit contenir un exposé concis des faits substantiels. Il ne suffit pas, par exemple, de conclure que l'on n'a pas accès aux services d'un coiffeur, que les services de bibliothèque sont insuffisants ou que l'on est privé de soleil. Il convient, en effet, d'exposer de manière claire et précise ce qui s'est passé, quand cela s'est passé et où. Quelle est la norme prescrite par la loi? Dans quelle mesure les agents de la défenderesse ont-ils manqué à cette norme? Tout cela doit être décrit dans un acte de procédure approprié.\n[13]\nLa Cour devrait-elle intervenir à ce moment-ci? Il y a des voies de recours mieux adaptées à l'expression de tels sentiments de colère et de frustration. Il y a des voies de recours qui permettent d'identifier et de corriger les carences dans les services. Il s'agit notamment de mécanismes de médiation et de règlement des griefs. Dans leur dossier modifié, au paragraphe 17, les demandeurs dressent une longue liste de numéros de référence, correspondant vraisemblablement aux procédures de règlement de griefs qu'ils ont engagées. Si la Cour a, dans certains cas, accueilli une action malgré l'existence d'une procédure de règlement des griefs, il est, avant de porter une affaire devant la Cour, habituel et souhaitable de déposer un grief et d'attendre qu'il soit tranché.\n[14]\nPar conséquent, la Cour conclut, en ce qui concerne les actes de procédure, y compris le projet de déclaration modifiée que:\na) la déclaration est inadéquate, car elle ne fait pas spécifiquement état des circonstances de fait précises à l'origine de la demande; elle ne fait pas état de la norme applicable; elle n'explique pas comment et en quoi les agents de la défenderesse ont manqué à cette norme;\nb) la déclaration n'est cependant pas à ce point inadéquate qu'il y ait lieu de refuser l'autorisation de la modifier;\nc) une partie ne peut être jointe à l'action par le simple dépôt d'une demande modifiée; il faut pour cela solliciter l'autorisation de la Cour;\nd) les demandeurs devraient se faire représenter par un avocat;\ne) les parties devraient agir avec sérénité et bonne foi et, avant de s'adresser à la Cour, épuiser les procédures de médiation et de règlement des griefs.\nORDONNANCE\n[15]\nEN CONSÉQUENCE,\nla présente instance est suspendue pour une période de six (6) mois afin que:\n1. les demandeurs retiennent les services d'un avocat. S'ils sont dans l'impossibilité de le faire, ils devront, dans les cinq (5) mois, porter à l'attention de la Cour les difficultés qu'ils éprouvent et les raisons pour lesquelles ils ne parviennent pas à retenir les services d'un avocat;\n2. l'avocat de la défenderesse devra, dans les deux (2) mois, faire savoir aux demandeurs et à la Cour les services juridiques dont pourraient bénéficier les demandeurs, y compris l'aide juridique, les services d'un avocat bénévole ou autre;\n3. avant l'expiration de ce délai de six (6) mois, les parties feront savoir à la Cour où en sont les procédures de règlement des griefs engagées;\n4. au plus tard à la fin de ce délai de six (6) mois, les parties feront connaître à la Cour la où en seront les procédures de médiation engagées ainsi que les efforts entrepris pour discuter entre elles des différends afin de les résoudre;\n5. à la réception de ces renseignements, la Cour donnera des directives quant à la procédure à suivre en la présente instance;\n6. la question des dépens sera tranchée ultérieurement.\n[End of document]",

Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the defendant.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nHughes, J.\n: The Defendant, Her Majesty the Queen, has brought a motion to strike the Statement of Claim in this action as filed on June 13, 2012 and for other relief. For the reasons that follow, I am ordering that the action is to be stayed for six (6) months on certain conditions.\n\n[2]\nThe Plaintiffs, as enumerated in the Statement of Claim filed June 13, 2012, are all prisoners in a federal penitentiary located in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. They claim damages in excess of fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars as against the Defendant for, as described in paragraph 1 of that Claim:\n negligence\n negligent infliction of nervous shock\n intentional infliction of nervous shock\n misfeasance in Public Office\n breach of sections 7, 8, 9, 12 and 15(1) of the Charter\n\n[3]\nIn addition, they claim aggravated and exemplary damages, costs on a lawyer/client basis, and other relief.\n\n[4]\nThe first named Plaintiff, Christopher Brazeau, describes himself in paragraph 2 of the Claim as \"Plaintiff in lead\". None of the Plaintiffs describe themselves as lawyers entitled to practise law in any of Canada's provinces or territories. Each of the Plaintiffs has personally signed the Statement of Claim. In the materials filed in the Court record, such as the Plaintiff's submissions on this motion, the Plaintiff Brazeau appears to be acting as the spokesman for all Plaintiffs.\n\n[5]\nIn response to the Defendant's original motion to strike, the Plaintiffs filed a response, together with a document entitled \"Amended Statement of Claim etc\".This document was not filed as a separate document purporting to amend the original Statement of Claim. This document purports to add two further Plaintiffs and to provide further particulars beyond that which was set out in the original Statement of Claim. In the meantime, Justice Snider of this Court has given an Order, together with Reasons (cited as 2012 FC 648), in another action, T-1543-11, involving the same person, Christopher Brazeau, as Plaintiff, and the Attorney General of Canada. Her Order dealt with a motion to strike brought by the Attorney General.\n\n[6]\nAs a result, I gave a Direction requesting that the Defendant in the present action provide an amended argument dealing with Justice Snider's Reasons and the purported amendments to the Statement of Claim in this action. The Defendant has now provided an Amended Motion Record. The Plaintiffs, through the Plaintiff Brazeau, have provided an Amended Record in response. I will deal with the motion, principally having regard to these documents; but I also have in mind the earlier documents provided in the record.\n\n[7]\nI start with noting that none of the Plaintiffs are lawyers. At paragraph 6 of their Memorandum of Argument, they state that they \"...are not legally trained and must prepare and argue their case without the assistance/advice of counsel ...\". Nonetheless, a reading of the Claim and other materials provided by the Plaintiffs demonstrates that considerable time and effort has been expended by one or more of them in conducting some sort of legal research into the matter. Therein lies one of the problems encountered by self-represented litigants such as the Plaintiffs. Legal training involves more than just reading materials and copying from precedents. It requires a thorough knowledge of the law and how it is practised, and the exercise of experienced judgment in determining, for instance, whether a claim should be made to the Courts or to some other person or tribunal; how that claim fits within the principles of law; and how that claim is to be set forth properly in the relevant documents in which a claim is submitted. While many people can wield a knife, not all are surgeons. While many people can read Rules of Practice and legal texts, not all are barristers or solicitors. It takes not only knowledge, but thorough knowledge, exercised through experienced judgment to get it right.\n\n[8]\nI have no information as to whether the Plaintiffs sought legal advice and failed to obtain it, for financial reasons or otherwise. Nor do I have any information as to whether the Plaintiffs did secure legal advice and chose not to follow it.\n\n[9]\nThe Plaintiffs' circumstances are described by themselves in paragraph 17 of their Amended Statement of Claim:\n17. The awkward, damaging positions and uncomfortable extremes of the Plaintiffs Detention is inflicting extreme stress and nervous shock by inter alia\n:\n(a) being unable to understand, control or offset the effects or impositions;\n(b) having to self deaden in order to cope, which in turn;\n(c) diminishes ability and capacity to bear desire, feel/express emotions including the ability/desire to;\n(d) express and/or enjoy mutuality, connectivity and meaning making;\n(e) sleep deprivation\n(f) being unable to express and/or realize my rights\n(g) constantly being overwhelmed with hopelessness and erosion of self worth/value\n(h) loosing control over my ability to tolerate my circumstances and maintain my composure/sanity at the same time;\n(i) constantly worrying and fearing over the longevity and extent these effects will have on my life, personality and future;\n(j) feeling constant and incessant\nsubtle anger over being unable to make fundamental and critical life choices;\n(k)\nall of which resemble the symptoms associated with Morbid Depression, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Order, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\n(l)\nother, not limited by the foregoing which has occured both during and subsequent to the conduct of the Defendant\n\n[10]\nHere we see expressions of anger, hopelessness, diminished capacity and losing control. One is reminded of a quotation ascribed to Gautama Buddha, \"Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned\". Similarly, one can cite Greeks such as Sophocles and Seneca \"Whom god wishes to destroy, he first makes mad.\"\n\n[11]\nIn viewing the Statement of Claim and Amended Statement of Claim, the Court can clearly grasp that the Plaintiffs are unhappy to the point of frustration, distraction and despair, with the circumstances of their imprisonment. Whether this is a normal and expected consequence of that imprisonment or whether their circumstances have gone beyond those prescribed by the laws of Canada, is not sufficiently clear from the pleadings, even those as amended. What the pleadings do set forth are conclusions. What they must set forth are:\n the precise circumstances at issue: the who, what, when and where relevant events leading to the complaint took place\n the resulting effect\n the standard required by law\n the manner in which those circumstances failed to live up to the standards required by law\n what harm resulted\n\n[12]\nThe Rules of this Court, including Rule 174, require a pleading to contain a concise statement of the material facts. Simply to conclude, for example, that barber services were not provided, or that library services were inadequate; or that access to sunlight was not provided, is insufficient. What happened, when, and where; who was involved must be clearly and precisely set out. What is the standard required by law? How did the Defendant's servants fall short of that standard? All of this is required of a proper pleading.\n\n[13]\nShould the Court be involved at this time? There are more appropriate resources through which anger and frustration can be worked out. There are resources through which inadequate services can be identified and redressed. These include mediation and grievance procedures. The Plaintiffs in their amended Record, paragraph 17, set out a long list of reference numbers, presumably identifying grievance procedures that have been initiated. While in some circumstances, the Court has permitted an action to proceed notwithstanding the availability or pursuit of a grievance process, the more usual and more desirable procedure is that a proper grievance or grievances should be fairly pursued and determined before the Court is asked to address the situation.\n\n[14]\nAccordingly, the Court concludes in respect of the pleadings, including the draft amended Statement of Claim:\na) the Statement of Claim is inadequate; it fails to set out the specific factual circumstances giving rise to a claim; it fails to set out the standard required; it fails to set out how and in what respect the Defendant's officers failed to meet that standard;\nb) the Statement of Claim, however, is not so inadequate that leave to amend should be denied;\nc) no party can be added by simply filing an amended Claim; leave of the Court must be sought;\nd) the Plaintiffs should seek competent legal representation;\ne) the parties should calmly act in good faith and follow appropriate mediation and grievance procedures before seeking the assistance of the Court.\nORDER\n\n[15]\nACCORDINGLY,\nI will stay the present action for a period of six (6) months so as to permit:\n1. The Plaintiffs to secure competent legal counsel. If they cannot do so, they shall advise the Court within five (5) months as to the difficulties experienced and why they are unable to do so.\n2. Defendant's Counsel shall, within two (2) months, advise the Plaintiffs and the Court as to competent legal services that may be available to the Plaintiffs, including Legal Aid,\npro bono\nservices, and otherwise.\n3. The parties shall advise on or before the expiration of six (6) months as to the status of any grievance procedure or procedures taken.\n4. The parties shall advise on or before the expiry of six (6) months as to any mediation process(es) undertaken, and efforts undertaken as between themselves to discuss and resolve their disputes.\n5. Upon receipt of the foregoing, the Court shall provide direction as to procedures to be followed in the present action.\n6. Costs are reserved.\n.........................\nChristopher Brazeau and Bradley Rogers and Harvey Andres and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Reine, filed a motion seeking the expungement of the declaration filed on June 13, 2012, in this action, as well as various other relief. For the reasons set out below, the Court will order that the action be suspended for six (6) months, under certain conditions. [2]\nThe applicants, as listed in the declaration filed on June 13, 2012, are all inmates of the federal penitentiary in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. They claim damages of more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) from the defendant, claiming, according to the description in paragraph 1 of the declaration in question:\n negligence\n the infliction, through negligence, of nervous shocks\n the deliberate infliction of nervous shock\n misconduct in the performance of official duties\n violation of sections 7, 8, 9 and 12 as well as subsection 15(1) of the Charter [3]\nThey further seek aggravated and punitive damages, attorney-client costs, and various other relief. [4]\nThe first of the listed plaintiffs, Christopher Brazeau, identifies himself, in paragraph 2 of the statement of claim, as lead plaintiff. None of the applicants hold themselves out as lawyers admitted to practice in any territory or province of Canada. The applicants all signed the declaration. In the documents filed in the Court file, including in the applicant's observations regarding this motion, the applicant Brazeau appears to act as a spokesperson for all of the applicants. [5]\nFollowing the motion to strike initially filed by the defendant, the plaintiffs filed a response, accompanied by a document entitled Amended Declaration, etc.  This document was not filed as a separate document to amend the statement originally filed. This document purports to join two plaintiffs to the action, and to provide additional details beyond what was contained in the initial statement. In the meantime, Justice Snider, on behalf of the Court, issued a reasoned order (reference: 2012 FC 648), in the context of file T-1543-11, another action brought by the same plaintiff, Christopher Brazeau, against the Attorney General of Canada. Judge Snider's order addressed a motion to expunge filed by the Attorney General. [6]\nThat being so, I have issued a direction requiring the respondent in this case to submit an amended argument regarding Judge Snider's reasons and the changes that purported to have been made to the statement in this case. The defendant has since submitted an amended motion brief. The plaintiffs, through plaintiff Brazeau, responded by filing an amended filing. I will now rule on the request, primarily in light of these documents, but I also intend to take into account the documents previously placed on file. [7]\nRemember that none of the plaintiffs are lawyers. In paragraph 6 of their Statement of Case, they specify that they ... have no legal training, and therefore must prepare and defend their case without the assistance or advice of a lawyer ... . It appears, however, from the declaration and other documents filed by the plaintiffs, that one or more of them have devoted considerable time and effort to the study of the questions of law raised in this case. This is one of the problems experienced by litigants who, like plaintiffs, represent themselves in court. Legal training does not, in fact, rely solely on reading documents and researching precedents. Such training also requires in-depth knowledge of law and its practice, as well as a capacity for reflection based on experience and enabling, for example, to know whether an application should be brought before the Court, or before some other authority. It is also a question of knowing precisely where the request fits among the applicable legal principles, and how to formulate it correctly in the necessary documents. Many people know how to use a knife, but that does not make them surgeons. Many people can read procedural rules and legal texts, but not all of them are lawyers. Doing things right requires not just knowledge, but in-depth knowledge applied with the discernment that experience brings. [8]\nI do not know whether, for financial or other reasons, the plaintiffs attempted unsuccessfully to retain counsel. I also can't know if they actually had the benefit of legal advice but decided not to follow it. [9]\nHere is how, in paragraph 17 of their amended statement of claim, the applicants describe the situation in which they find themselves:\n[translation]\n17. The inconvenient and harmful positions, and the extreme discomfort that their detention imposes on the applicants, inflict extreme stress and nervous shock on them, in particular because:\na) they are unable to understand, control or compensate for the consequences of what is imposed on them;\nb) to cope with the situation, they have to close themselves off, which leads to;\nc) an attack on their ability and capacity to desire, experience and express their emotions including the capacity and desire to:\nd) express and experience feelings of mutuality, connectedness and meaning;\ne) sleep deprivation;\nf) an inability to express and/or realize my rights;\ng) constantly overwhelmed by despair and a progressive deterioration of self-esteem and self-esteem;\nh) loss of control over my ability to tolerate the situation I find myself in and, at the same time, maintain my composure and not go crazy;\ni) constant worry and fear about the duration and scope of the effects that all of this will have on my life, on my personality and on my future;\nj) the constant and incessant feeling\nof a subtle anger born from the fact that I do not have the means to make the fundamental and essential choices of existence\n;\nk)\nall these correspond to the symptoms of morbid depression, antisocial personality disorders, obsessive-compulsive neurosis and post-traumatic stress disorder\n;\nl)\nother disorders which manifested themselves during the defendant's behavior, or which followed it\n. [10]\nWe are faced with the expression of feelings of anger, despair, diminished abilities and loss of control. This reminds us of the words attributed to the Buddha: Clinging to one's anger is like grabbing a burning ember with the intention of throwing it at someone; it's you who gets burned.  In a similar vein, we could cite Greek authors, such as Sophocles and Seneca, who say that those whom the gods want to destroy, they first make mad. [11]\nReading the declaration and the amended declaration, the Court clearly understands that the discontent and frustration that their conditions of detention inspire in the detainees push them to despair and lose their minds. The procedural documents, even as amended, do not allow us to say whether this situation is the normal and expected consequence of their incarceration, or whether it goes beyond what is prescribed by Canadian law. What the declaration contains are observations, whereas it should state:\n the precise circumstances of this case: that is, in relation to the events giving rise to the statement in this case, who did what, when and where;\n the repercussions this had;\n the standard that the law imposes;\n how the circumstances in question violate the standards prescribed by law;\n the resulting harm. [12]\nAccording to the Rules of Court, in particular article 174, every procedural document must contain a concise statement of the material facts. It is not enough, for example, to conclude that one does not have access to the services of a hairdresser, that library services are insufficient or that one is deprived of sunlight. It is appropriate, in fact, to explain clearly and precisely what happened, when it happened and where. What is the standard prescribed by law? To what extent did the defendant's agents fail to meet this standard? All this must be described in an appropriate procedural document. [13]\nShould the Court intervene at this time? There are better avenues for expressing such feelings of anger and frustration. There are remedies available to identify and correct deficiencies in services. These include mediation and grievance mechanisms. In their amended case, in paragraph 17, the applicants set out a long list of reference numbers, presumably corresponding to the grievance procedures they have initiated. While the Court has, in some cases, allowed an action despite the existence of a grievance procedure, it is, before bringing a case before the Court, customary and desirable to file a grievance and wait for it to be decided. [14]\nTherefore, the Court concludes, with respect to the pleadings, including the draft amended declaration that:\n(a) the statement is inadequate because it does not specifically state the precise factual circumstances giving rise to the request; it does not state the applicable standard; it does not explain how and in what way the defendant's agents failed to meet this standard;\n(b) the declaration is not, however, so inadequate that authorization to amend it should be refused;\n(c) a party cannot be joined to the action simply by filing an amended application; To do this, it is necessary to seek authorization from the Court;\n(d) applicants should be represented by a lawyer;\n(e) the parties should act calmly and in good faith and, before approaching the Court, exhaust mediation and grievance procedures.\nORDER [15]\nCONSEQUENTLY,\nthis proceeding is suspended for a period of six (6) months so that:\n1. the applicants retain the services of an attorney. If they are unable to do so, they must, within five (5) months, bring to the attention of the Court the difficulties they are experiencing and the reasons why they are unable to retain the services of a lawyer;\n2. the defendant's lawyer must, within two (2) months, inform the plaintiffs and the Court of the legal services that the plaintiffs could benefit from, including legal aid, the services of a pro bono lawyer or otherwise;\n3. before the expiration of this six (6) month period, the parties will inform the Court of the status of the grievance settlement procedures initiated;\n4. at the latest at the end of this six (6) month period, the parties will inform the Court of the status of the mediation procedures initiated as well as the efforts undertaken to discuss the disputes between them in order to resolve them;\n5. upon receipt of this information, the Court will give directions as to the procedure to be followed in these proceedings;\n6. the question of costs will be decided later.\n[End of document]",

      "The court found the plaintiffs' statement of claim inadequate because it lacked specific factual details, failing to articulate the 'who, what, when, and where' of the alleged harms and how the defendant's actions fell short of legal standards. The court emphasized that pleadings must contain concise statements of material facts, not merely conclusions.",
      "The court recognized the plaintiffs were self-represented and had clearly invested effort in legal research, but distinguished between basic legal research and the practiced judgment of a trained legal professional. It analogized legal practice to surgery, noting that knowledge alone is insufficient without experience.",
      "The court determined that while the claim wasn't so deficient as to warrant dismissal without opportunity to amend, adding parties required leave of the court, which hadn't been sought. The attempted amendment was therefore procedurally flawed.",
      "The court suggested alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation and grievance procedures, as potentially more appropriate avenues for addressing the plaintiffs' complaints before resorting to litigation, particularly given the existence of initiated grievance processes.",
      "The court stayed the action for six months to allow the plaintiffs to secure legal counsel, with the defendant directed to provide information on available legal services (legal aid, pro bono). This stay was conditioned on the plaintiffs reporting on their efforts to obtain counsel and the status of any grievance or mediation processes.",
      "The court acknowledged the plaintiffs' expressions of distress and frustration but emphasized that the pleadings needed to establish a legally cognizable claim, demonstrating a breach of a legal standard resulting in harm, rather than simply stating feelings of anger or despair. The court referenced philosophical and literary allusions to illustrate the self-destructive nature of unchecked anger.",
      "The court applied Rule 174 of its Rules of Court, which mandates a concise statement of material facts in pleadings, as the basis for finding the statement of claim deficient. The court’s reasoning centered on the need for a clear articulation of the factual basis for the legal claims."
