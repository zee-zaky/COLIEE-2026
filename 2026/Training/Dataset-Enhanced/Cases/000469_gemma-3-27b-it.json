    "[0]\nI.\nOverview",
    "[1]\nO'Reilly, J.\n: The defendant Merck Frosst Canada & Co. holds the rights to a patented drug called norfloxacin. (On consent, the action against the other named defendant Merck & Co., Inc. was dismissed). In the early 1990s, Apotex Inc. tried to enter the market with a generic version of norfloxacin and, to that end, applied to the Minister of Health for a Notice of Compliance (NOC). Apotex alleged that it would not infringe the defendant's patent as it would either use norfloxacin raw material acquired by a third company, Novopharm Ltd., under a license from Merck, or it would produce norfloxacin by a method that would not infringe the patent.",
    "[2]\nMerck filed two applications to prohibit the Minister from issuing an NOC to Apotex. In respect of the first, relating to the use of a non-infringing method of making norfloxacin, Justice Marshall Rothstein granted the order Merck sought, and the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Apotex's appeal (\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n.\nv. Canada\n(\nMinister of National Health and Welfare\n), [1999] F.C.J. No. 209 (F.C.A.)).",
    "[3]\nIn respect of the second application, relating to the use of licensed material, Justice Sandra Simpson granted Merck its order in 1995 (\nMerck Frosst Canada\nInc\n. v.\nCanada (Minister of National Health and Welfare\n) (1995), 65 C.P.R. (3d) 483 (F.C.T.D.)). Apotex appealed her decision unsuccessfully to the Federal Court of Appeal (\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n. v.\nCanada (Minister of National Health and Welfare\n) (1996), 67 C.P.R. (3d) 455 (F.C.A.)). Apotex appealed again to the Supreme Court of Canada and succeeded in having the prohibition order set aside on July 9, 1998 (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). A week later, the Minister issued Apotex its NOC.",
    "[4]\nApotex now seeks compensation from Merck under s. 8 of the\nPatented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n, SOR/93-133, as amended by SOR/98-166 (relevant regulatory provisions are set out in Annexes I and II). Apotex argues that it is entitled to relief for having been kept out of the norfloxacin market for several years while the parties were in litigation.",
    "[5]\nTwo issues arise:\n1. Which version of the\nRegulations\napplies: the 1993 version, or the version that came into force in March 1998?\n2. If Merck had not sought an order prohibiting Apotex from obtaining an NOC, would Apotex have been able to get onto the market and, if so, when?",
    "[6]\nIn short, I find that the 1998 version of the\nRegulations\napplies to this action and that Apotex would have entered the market sooner had it not been prohibited by the operation of the\nRegulations\nand the order Merck obtained in 1995. Therefore, Apotex is entitled under the\nRegulations\nto obtain compensation from Merck. According to a bifurcation order, this phase of the trial is devoted solely to determining whether Apotex has a basis in fact and law for its claim. The quantum of damages will be determined in a subsequent phase.\nII.\nAnalysis\n1.\nWhich version of the Regulations applies: the 1993 version, or the version that came into force in March 1998\n?\n(a) Comparing the 1993 and 1998 versions of the\nRegulations",
    "[7]\nThe\nRegulations\nwere amended on March 12, 1998, about four months before the Supreme Court of Canada decided that Merck was not entitled to its prohibition order. The transitional rule in the 1998 Regulations (s. 9(6)) states that the amended remedies section (s. 8) applies to applications that were \"pending\" at the time the new\nRegulations\ncame into force.",
    "[8]\nThe 1998 version of s. 8 makes clear that a company that succeeded in obtaining a prohibition order that was later reversed on appeal must compensate the company that was prevented from getting onto the market for \"any loss\" suffered from the date a notice of compliance would otherwise have been granted to that company (or some other appropriate date) up until the date of the reversal.",
    "[9]\nApotex argues that Merck's application was \"pending\" at the time the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force because its merits had not been finally determined. That did not happen until the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on it in July 1998. Therefore, Apotex argues, the 1998\nRegulations\n, particularly the amended remedies clause, apply to Merck. Accordingly, Merck must compensate Apotex for its losses from the date Apotex would otherwise have obtained its NOC up until the date of the Supreme Court's ruling. Apotex says the former date is June 10, 1993 and the latter, obviously, is July 9, 1998.",
    "[10]\nMerck argues that the 1998\nRegulations\ndo not apply because its application for a prohibition order was no longer \"pending\" at the time the new\nRegulations\ncame into force. Its application, it submits, was decided by Justice Simpson in 1995. The\norder\nshe granted was appealed and its merits were not finally decided until the Supreme Court handed down its judgment, but the\napplication\nitself was no longer pending.",
    "[11]\nThis is an important question for the parties because the meaning of the remedies provision of the 1993\nRegulations\nis, by all accounts, murky. The 1993 version of s. 8 says that a patent holder is liable for all damage suffered by a second company seeking an NOC where the Minister delays issuing the NOC beyond the expiration of all patents that are the subject of a prohibition order. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) that accompanied the 1993\nRegulations\nstated that the Governor-in-Council intended to create liability for a patent holder, like Merck, when a generic competitor, like Apotex, has wrongly been kept out of the market:\n\"In addition, some generic products that turn out [not] to have infringed an original applicant's product or use patents could be delayed under these Regulations where patents listed in a patentee NOC application turn out either not to be valid or not to be infringed by the sale of a later applicant's drug. However, the frequency and costs associated with any such delays arising from these Regulations will be minimized by the fact that such a patentee will be liable for all damage suffered from the delay.\"",
    "[12]\nI must point out that the word \"not\" in the first sentence was not included in the original RIAS. However, this was an obvious oversight taking into account both the context, as well as the French version of the RIAS, which states that \"certains produits génériques qui ...\nne sont pas\ndes contrefaçons d'un brevet original pourrait avoir été retardée indûment ... \".",
    "[13]\nBoth parties presented plausible interpretations of what this section might mean. Apotex suggests that the 1993 and 1998 provisions, while differently worded, are identical in their effect. Merck maintains that the 1993 version creates no liability for it while the 1998 version creates absolute liability. Frankly, the meaning of the 1993 version eludes me. As Justice James Hugessen said of it:\n\"Section 8 is particularly obscure in its meaning. It appears to create a liability in the first person in the event that the Minister should comply with the 30 month prohibition in circumstances where subsection 7(2) specifically provides that that prohibition shall have ceased to apply. Fortunately, we are not required to interpret it on this appeal. (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at 316)\"",
    "[14]\nIt seems reasonably clear from the RIAS that the Governor-in-Council's original intention was to create liability along the lines of what was promulgated in the 1998\nRegulations\n. The 1998 RIAS states that the purpose of the amendment was to provide a \"clearer indication\" \"as to the circumstances in which damages could be awarded to a generic manufacturer to compensate for loss suffered by reason of delayed market entry of its drug\". From this, it seems the original intention was to create liability for patent holders where generic companies were denied early entry to the market, and that the purpose of the 1998 amendment was simply to make this clearer. However, in 1993, the Governor-in-Council apparently did not find words to express its intention. In 1998, it did.",
    "[15]\nIn any case, I do not have to determine definitively what the 1993\nRegulations\nmean because, in my view, the 1998 version applies here. In other words, I conclude that Merck's application was, indeed, \"pending\" in March 1998 and, therefore, according to the transitional rule, the 1998\nRegulations\napply to this action.\n(b) What is a \"pending\" application?",
    "[16]\nObviously, the word \"pending\" must take its meaning from the context in which it is used. Merck argues that one must look to the other words in the 1998\nRegulations\nfor guidance. It points out that the transitional rule (s. 9(6)) refers to applications pending at the time the\nRegulations\ncame into force. The remedies section itself (s. 8) provides relief where an application \"is withdrawn or discontinued\" or \"is dismissed by the court hearing the application\" or if \"an order preventing the Minister from issuing a notice of compliance ... is reversed on appeal\". In Merck's submission, when the transitional rule speaks of an application \"pending\" it is referring to the time period prior to an application being withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. It is not referring to the point in time after the application has been granted and a prohibition order has been issued, even if the order is reversed on appeal. Had the provision been intended to apply to orders whose merits were pending before appellate courts, the provision would have used the word \"order\" not \"application\".",
    "[17]\nMerck further argues that to interpret the 1998\nRegulations\nas applying to these circumstances would be to give them a retrospective effect. There is no specific authority given to the Governor-in-Council in the\nPatent Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, to enact retrospective regulations. Therefore, if I interpret the transitional rule as purporting to apply to these circumstances, Merck says I must find that it is beyond the regulatory authority of the Governor-in-Council. In support of that argument, Merck asserts that application of the 1998 remedies provision would interfere with its vested rights.",
    "[18]\nIn my view, Merck's application for a prohibition order remained pending when the 1998 Regulations came into force. Accordingly, it is s. 8 of the 1998\nRegulations\nthat defines the remedies available in the circumstances. As I read it, this provision does not operate retrospectively and, even if it did, it does interfere with any vested rights of Merck.",
    "[19]\nIn general, a pending matter is one in which further steps can be taken in it (\nIn re Clagett's Estate\n;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  finally decided - \"[t] he suit does not expire with the decision given by the trial judge\". Rather, a proceeding is \"still alive, still pending until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.) at paras. 13, 20).",
    "[20]\nWithin the context of the 1998\nRegulations\n, Justice Roger Hughes found that proceedings are pending if they are \"not yet finished\" and \"there is no final judgment\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 38). By contrast, a final judgment is one that is rendered when \"all appeals have disposed of the matter\" (para. 39). By that reasoning, Merck's application was still pending when the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force; the Supreme Court of Canada was still seized of the matter and had not rendered a final decision on the merits of Merck's application.",
    "[21]\nJustice Hughes noted that, in the case before him, the application was not pending at the time the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force. The Court had issued a prohibition order and an appeal from that decision had been dismissed well before the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force on March 12, 1998. The matter was not pending; it was final. Therefore, the 1993\nRegulations\napplied, not the 1998 version. At a later point, in 1999, the order was set aside by Justice Barbara Reed who, at the same time, dismissed the underlying application. Justice Hughes found that the dismissal of the application would have triggered the remedy provision of the 1998\nRegulations\n, had they applied.",
    "[22]\nI note that in the matter before me the Supreme Court of Canada specifically dismissed Merck's application for an order of prohibition in its July 9, 1998 decision when it allowed Apotex's appeal. Both the dismissal of the application and the reversal of the decision on which the prohibition order was based trigger liability under the 1998 version of the\nRegulations\n. If Merck's application had not then been \"pending\", there would have been no reason for the Supreme Court to dismiss it.",
    "[23]\nAs mentioned, the word \"pending\" takes its meaning from the context in which it is used. Merck rightly points out that, for purposes of determining rights of appeal under s. 27 of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, C. F-7, s. 1; 2002, c. 8, s. 14, an application would not be pending after the Federal Court had ruled on it. It would be considered a final decision and amenable to appeal. In this case, the Federal Court decided Merck's application for prohibition in 1995 and, for purposes of Merck's right of appeal, the Court's decision was a final determination. In that context, one could not say that the application was pending.",
    "[24]\nHowever, looking at the broader context, it could not be said, once appealed, that the merits of Merck's application had been finally determined. Its application was \"pending\" in the sense that its legal foundation was very much a live issue before the Supreme Court of Canada when the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect.",
    "[25]\nMerck argues that the reference to an \"application\" in the transitional rule (s. 9(6)) corresponds only to the scenarios outlined in s. 8 in which an application is withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. It does not extend to an order being reversed on appeal. By this interpretation, an application would be pending only up to the point when it is withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. An application that gave rise to a prohibition order could not be said to be pending, even if appealed, Merck says. If the intention had been for the 1998\nRegulations\nto apply to orders under appeal, the transitional rule would have used clearer language, such as \"section 8 applies to all ongoing proceedings relating to the issuance of a prohibition order\".",
    "[26]\nI am not persuaded by this argument. First, as mentioned, the meaning of \"pending\" is reasonably clear and I must assume the drafters of the transitional rule would have been aware of its breadth. Second, as the 1998 RIAS describes, the purpose of the revised remedies provision was to clarify the liability of patent holders and not, as Merck suggests, to create an entirely new basis for it. It would not be unfair in that context to apply the amended provision to all cases that were in the system at that point and no particular reason to treat cases in which a prohibition order was under appeal differently from those at an earlier stage of litigation.",
    "[27]\nMerck relies on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). There, the Court found that when the\nRegulations\nrefer to an application being \"finally dismissed by the court\" they mean dismissed by the Federal Court, not the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada. Accordingly, Merck says, an application should be considered pending only when it is before the Federal Court. I note, however, that the word \"court\" is defined in the\nRegulations\nspecifically to mean the Federal Court. The passage in issue in that case clearly related to the initial decision by the applications judge. The\nRegulations\nhave since been amended to refer to the court \"hearing the application\" (s. 7(4), s. 8). However, in the transitional rule in s. 9(6) of the 1998\nRegulations\n, the word \"court\" is not used. The provision merely refers to an \"application pending\" when the\nRegulations\ncame into force. It does not refer to an \"application pending before the court\" or to an \"application pending before the court hearing the application\". When the Governor-in-Council wished to be specific about the relevant stage of proceedings, it used specific language.",
    "[28]\nFurther, I do not interpret the 1998\nRegulations\nas interfering with Merck's vested rights. At best, before the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect, Merck had the right to have its liability to Apotex determined according to the 1993 version of s. 8, the meaning of which is wholly uncertain. This does not amount to a vested right. Merck had the right to argue that the 1993 version of s. 8 did not impose liability upon it but the outcome of such an argument is unknowable. No court has been required to interpret the former s. 8 and, it follows, no court has found that companies  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's circumstances were not liable to generic manufacturers kept out of the market by virtue of the operation of the\nRegulations\n. Merck had the right to urge a favourable interpretation of the\nRegulations\non an attentive court, but no more. As mentioned, Merck submits that it went from having no liability under the 1993\nRegulations\nto having absolute liability under the 1998\nRegulations\n. In other words, it made its application to keep Apotex out of the market knowing that there would be no adverse economic consequences of doing so, even if it failed to obtain its prohibition order or if the order was later overturned. I think Merck overstates its case. In my view, it went from having uncertain liability in 1993 to having potential liability in 1998. It did not give up a vested right, only an untested argument. Merck repeatedly asserted that s. 8 of the 1993\nRegulations\nwas equivalent to an undertaking in damages and yet, at the same time, maintained that it not impose any obligations on Merck. I find this position unpersuasive. Accordingly, I cannot find that the 1998\nRegulations\nhave an impermissible retrospective effect, beyond the competence of the Governor-in-Council.",
    "[29]\nSection 8 sets out the liability of a patent holder for losses of a generic competitor who was kept out of the market by virtue of the operation of the\nRegulations\n. That liability, on the facts of this case, was triggered by the Supreme Court of Canada's dismissal of Merck's application and its reversal of the prohibition order. That event did not take place until after the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect. Apotex's s. 8 claim could not been initiated until after the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in July 1998 and the remedies provision of the 1998\nRegulations\n, quite naturally, applied to it. Whether the 1993\nRegulations\nwould have given Apotex any relief is unknown, but there is nothing peculiar or unfair about Apotex initiating its action on the basis of the remedies provision then in force.",
    "[30]\nOne could say that, in this case, the 1998\nRegulations\ngovern events that straddle the date of its coming into force. Section 8 defines the scope of a patent holder's liability according to two dates - first, the date when the second company would have obtained its NOC but for the operation of the\nRegulations\nand, second, the date when the patent holder's prohibition order was overturned on appeal (or when its application was withdrawn or dismissed). In this case, the first date precedes the coming into force of the\nRegulations\n; the second date follows it. Justice Lebel described this situation as follows:\n\"New legislation does not operate retroactively when it is applied to a situation made up of a series of events that occurred before and after it came into force or with respect to legal effects straddling the date it came into force. If events are under way when it comes into force, the new legislation will apply in accordance with the principle of immediate application, that is, it governs the future development of the legal situation. If the legal effects of the situation are already occurring when the new legislation comes into force, the principle of retrospective effect applies. According to this principle, the new legislation governs the future consequences of events that happened before it came into force but does not modify effects that occurred before that date.\" (\nÉpiciers  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 46).",
    "[31]\nEven on this characterization of the\nRegulations\n, I cannot see any interference with any vested rights Merck might have held. Therefore, to the extent the\nRegulations\ncan be described as retrospective, I see no basis for Merck's argument that they run afoul of the general rule that subordinate legislation cannot operate retrospectively unless the enabling legislation clearly authorizes it.",
    "[32]\nIn conclusion, I find that the 1998\nRegulations\napply in this case. Merck is therefore liable to Apotex for \"any loss suffered during the period\" from the date Apotex would otherwise have obtained an NOC until the date Merck's application was dismissed. I come now to the second issue:\n2.\nIf Merck had not sought an order prohibiting Apotex from obtaining a NOC, would Apotex have been able to get onto the market and, if so, when?\n(a) Burden of Proof",
    "[33]\nIn essence, I must decide if Apotex did, in fact, suffer a loss by having been kept out of the market by virtue of the prohibition proceedings Merck had initiated. This requires me to consider what would have happened if Merck had not done so.",
    "[34]\nApotex argues that it does not have to prove on a balance of probabilities that, but for the operation of the\nRegulations\n, it would have entered the norfloxacin market. Rather, it need only show that it had a reasonable chance of doing so. The cases relied on by Apotex for this proposition deal with the calculation of damages where courts must consider the likelihood of future contingencies that might affect quantum (e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 243; 132 W.A.C. 243;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). But here we are considering Merck's liability for damages, not the quantification of those damages. At this stage, in my view, Apotex must show on a balance of probabilities that it was prevented from getting into the norfloxacin market because of Merck's prohibition application. As Justice Norris said in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Apotex must \"establish on the balance of probabilities that the chance of making a profit was real and not fanciful\" (para. 5(e)). This is consistent with the approach taken by Justice Johanne Gauthier in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 762. In the circumstances, Apotex must show, at a minimum, that it had access to a supply of norfloxacin. Without that, its assertion that it was kept out of the market by Merck's prohibition application would be fanciful, not real.",
    "[35]\nSection 8 provides relief within a defined period, beginning on the date the Minister would have issued an NOC to the generic manufacturer (unless some other date is more appropriate) and ending on the date the prohibition order was overturned. In this case, the relevant time frame is between June 10, 1993 and July 9, 1998. There is no basis in law for choosing a more appropriate beginning date, although that is not to say that Apotex, as a matter of fact, started suffering a loss on June 10, 1993.",
    "[36]\nAs mentioned above, this phase of the trial is confined to determining whether Apotex has shown a basis in fact and law for its claim. Above, I found that s. 8 of the 1998 Regulations provides a basis in law for Apotex's claim. Now, I must decide whether Apotex has proved a factual basis for it - that is, whether it would actually have been able to enter the norfloxacin market before 1998 and, if so, when.",
    "[37]\nIn summary, Merck argues that Apotex has failed to meet that burden because Apotex has not proved that it had an available supply of non-infringing material that would have permitted it to get product on the market.\n(c) Factors Affecting Market Entry",
    "[38]\nI need only consider whether Apotex could have entered the market with material obtained from Novopharm under Novopharm's compulsory license with Merck. The other possible route, through use of norfloxacin manufactured by a non-infringing process, was foreclosed by the decisions of Justice Rothstein and the Federal Court of Appeal, where it was found that the process proposed by Apotex actually did infringe the patent. It was also held up, as a matter of fact, by the difficulties that Apotex's supplier, Delmar Chemicals Inc., encountered in producing norfloxacin by an allegedly non-infringing process without impurities.",
    "[39]\nApotex's alternative was to use material obtained through Novopharm. Novopharm had a compulsory license from Merck for norfloxacin and had a reciprocal agreement with Apotex to supply licensed material on request. The Federal Court of Appeal concluded that this supply agreement amounted to an improper sublicense but the Supreme Court of Canada found otherwise in its decision of July 9, 1998. Therefore, the supply agreement created a means by which Apotex could, at least in theory, enter the norfloxacin market without infringing Merck's patent rights.",
    "[40]\nIn my view, however, Apotex was not in a position to enter the norfloxacin market in June 1993 even if there had been no prohibition application by Merck. There are two main reasons for this:\n1. Apotex did not have a willing supplier.\n2. Apotex did not have a willing partner in Novopharm, notwithstanding their mutual supply agreement.",
    "[41]\nOn the other hand, as discussed below, Apotex probably would have been able to enter the market by July 1996, when it could have asked Novopharm to obtain raw material from a foreign source, as it did in 1998, after Apotex received its NOC. The question, then, is whether Apotex could have entered the market prior to July 1996, notwithstanding its difficulties getting cooperation from its intended supplier, Delmar, and putative partner, Novopharm.\n(d) Problems with Supply",
    "[42]\nApotex submits that in 1993 it had a supplier who was ready and willing to provide Apotex with norfloxacin. Apotex was a minority shareholder in Delmar Chemicals Inc. and, accordingly, Apotex was entitled to request Delmar to provide it with material so long as doing so would not strain Delmar's capacity. However, Delmar was clearly uncomfortable with the arrangements Apotex was proposing.",
    "[43]\nApotex purported to order norfloxacin directly from Delmar on Novopharm's behalf. Delmar raised concerns about Apotex's proposal and, in 1995, sought a legal opinion about it. Thereafter, it agreed to supply norfloxacin only if it obtained indemnification from Apotex and Novopharm, and received a direct request from Novopharm. Apotex provided an indemnity, but not until October 27, 1997. Delmar never did receive an order from Novopharm or any indemnity from it.",
    "[44]\nClearly, Delmar would not have been ready, in June 1993, to start providing Apotex with norfloxacin by way of Apotex's supply agreement with Novopharm. At a minimum, even if Apotex had its NOC in hand, it would have taken several months to arrive at an arrangement that would have been satisfactory to Delmar.\n(e) Problems with Novopharm",
    "[45]\nSince October 15, 1991, Novopharm had a compulsory license from Merck in respect of norfloxacin. The licence entitled Novopharm to make, use or sell norfloxacin as of July 2, 1993, and to import it after July 2, 1996. Novopharm entered into a supply agreement with Apotex on November 27, 1992. Under the agreement, Novopharm and Apotex each agreed to supply the other with pharmaceutical ingredients if one of them had a license and the other did not. In this case, since Novopharm had a license for norfloxacin, Apotex was entitled, it argues, to ask Novopharm to supply norfloxacin to Apotex  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's request.",
    "[46]\nHowever, it took Apotex some time actually to convince Novopharm to go along with the arrangement. In April 1993, Apotex advised Novopharm that it intended to rely on their supply agreement to obtain norfloxacin. Details about quantities were left to a later date. Novopharm replied by asking Apotex to confirm whether Novopharm's license remained valid and there were no other patents of concern, and to address an outstanding grievance between Novopharm and Apotex about another drug (enalapril). Apotex reminded Novopharm about the terms of their mutual supply agreement, and undertook to indemnify Novopharm for any liability it might incur in responding to Apotex's request (which was part of the supply agreement anyway). Novopharm responded by stating that its license was no longer valid and, therefore, could not be relied on by Apotex under the supply agreement. Further, it pointed out that Eli Lilly was challenging the legality of the supply agreement and that Novopharm expected Apotex to reimburse Novopharm for the legal costs of defending it.",
    "[47]\nThe correspondence between Apotex and Novopharm continued, to and fro, for many months, indeed years. It was not until November 16, 1995 that Apotex made a formal request to Novopharm to supply it with norfloxacin. In particular, Apotex asked Novopharm to arrange for the manufacture of 2,000 kilograms of norfloxacin at Delmar. Novopharm refused. It said that the supply agreement had been terminated and that Apotex's proposal to deal directly with Delmar rendered Novopharm's license invalid. This position was backed up by Novopharm's lawyers.",
    "[48]\nThings remained quiet until 1998, until after the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its decision finding the supply agreement between Apotex and Novopharm was not an invalid sublicense and, accordingly, dismissing Merck's application for an order of prohibition. The Supreme Court of Canada issued its decision on July 9, 1998. Apotex received its NOC a week later. It then demanded material from Novopharm pursuant to the supply agreement. Within weeks, Novopharm issued purchase orders for the requested material. On August 18, 1998, Apotex received its first material from Novopharm, who had obtained the material from Cipla, a foreign source. More foreign material arrived in September. Apotex entered the market with its first sales in September 1998. Apotex received more foreign material throughout the autumn and winter of 1998-1999.",
    "[49]\nNovopharm was not what one could call a willing partner. While it did supply material  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's request, its compliance was no doubt a product in part of legal proceedings underway between the parties. Those proceedings led to a decision of Justice Ferrier in the Ontario Court (General Division) in January 1999, in which he upheld the supply agreement (in relation to another drug, nizatidine. See Court File No. 98-CV-157772, January 28, 1999).",
    "[50]\nBased on these events, Apotex suggests that certainly as of July 2, 1996, when it would have been permitted to obtain material through foreign sources, through the combination of Novopharm's license and the supply agreement between Novopharm and Apotex, without infringing Merck's patent rights, it was in a position to enter the market within weeks. Foreign sources were available during the relevant time frame.",
    "[51]\nAs for domestic sources, Apotex maintains that Novopharm would have obtained material from Delmar on Apotex's request. As discussed above, Delmar would have required a direct request from Novopharm and indemnity from Novopharm against any potential patent liability. Apotex suggests that those conditions would have been met by Novopharm because they were covered by the supply agreement between Apotex and Novopharm. In turn, Novopharm would have been indemnified by Apotex. Delmar was in a position to supply norfloxacin; the raw materials were readily available in 1993. So, Delmar-produced norfloxacin could have been put on the market by Apotex soon after Apotex received its NOC, had the Minister issued it in June 1993.",
    "[52]\nMerck notes, however, that Apotex made no request of Novopharm in respect of norfloxacin until November 16, 1995. Dr. Barry Sherman for Apotex purported to direct Novopharm to arrange for the manufacture of 2000 kilograms of norfloxacin at Delmar. In fact, the draft letter he attached stated that Novopharm wished to manufacture norfloxacin at Delmar's facilities. Merck notes that Novopharm's licence was for manufacture of norfloxacin, not purchase from another manufacturer. Therefore, it was important for the parties to make arrangements that would respect the licence. The license included many terms but did not expressly include the right to have norfloxacin made by another manufacturer and sold to others. In my view, however, Novopharm's license was broad enough to permit manufacture of norfloxacin by an agent of Novopharm and sold to Apotex to make a medicine. As mentioned, Novopharm raised numerous objections to the arrangements Apotex was proposing, but none of them related to any limitations on its license.",
    "[53]\nMerck also argues that Apotex's NOA did not match its new drug submission (NDS). It suggests that Apotex would not have managed to have its norfloxacin approved in 1993, notwithstanding the Minister's letter to the contrary. In its original NDS in 1990, Apotex named Chemo Iberica as the supplier of its active ingredient. It amended the NDS in 1992 to substitute Torcan Chemical Ltd. as the source. As mentioned, the Torcan process was a more complicated four-step process compared to the patented two-step process. Nevertheless, the Torcan process was found to be an obvious variation and an infringement of Merck's patent (by Justice Rothstein, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 144 F.T.R. 299 (T.D.)) upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal,\nApotex Inc\n. v.\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n., [1999] F.C.J. No. 206; 236 N.R. 179 (F.C.A.)). So Apotex could not obtain an NOC for norfloxacin by the Torcan process.",
    "[54]\nMerck further submits that Apotex could not have obtained an NOC for norfloxacin made by Novopharm at Delmar using the patented process because its NDS referred to a different process. The Drug Master File (DMF) would have had to be amended, as well as the NDS, before an NOC could issue. Either way, Merck argues, Apotex could not obtain an NOC at any time prior to July 9, 1998. I am not persuaded by Merck's submissions on this point. Apotex could have made changes in source and process of manufacture relatively easily, either by informal means, particularly prior to 1994. Thereafter, Apotex would have had to advise Health Canada of a notifiable change. Substituting Delmar as the supplier would have been easily done as Delmar was already an approved manufacturer.",
    "[55]\nFinally, Merck argues that Apotex's statement of claim only alleges that Delmar would have allowed Novopharm actually to manufacture norfloxacin at its plant, and makes no reference to the possibility of Apotex having access to foreign material. Paragraph 23 of the statement of claim states that Delmar was ready \"to enter an arrangement with Novopharm to manufacture norfloxacin at its plant\". Delmar clearly would not have allowed Novopharm employees to enter its plant and start making a drug. However, it would have permitted an arrangement whereby Novopharm could oversee production at Delmar. In my view, this potential arrangement is contemplated by paragraph 23.",
    "[56]\nAs for foreign sources, paragraph 22 of the statement of claim mentions Novopharm's license which permitted it to manufacture norfloxacin as of July 2, 1993 and to import it as of July 2, 1996. In my view, this allegation permitted Apotex to lead evidence about foreign sources. However, as discussed above, Apotex would have had access to domestic material from Delmar in any case through the supply agreement with Novopharm. It was not dependent on foreign material.",
    "[57]\nThe problems Apotex would likely have had getting Novopharm's cooperation would have slowed, not stopped, Apotex from getting on the market. As with the supply problems with Delmar, I am satisfied it would have taken Apotex up to a year to establish an arrangement with Novopharm. Litigation might well have been necessary.\nIII. Conclusion and Disposition",
    "[58]\nIn my view, therefore, Apotex has met its burden of proving that it would have entered the norfloxacin market before July 9, 1998 but for the operation of the\nRegulations\n. However, taking account of the problems with supply from Delmar, and with the supply agreement with Novopharm, I conclude that Apotex would not have been able to get on the market until one full year after it would have received its NOC, that is, as of June 10, 1994. Therefore, Apotex is entitled to be compensated for the losses it suffered between that date and July 9, 1998. I will allow Apotex's action against Merck under s. 8 of the\nRegulations\n, with costs. Determination of the quantum of damages will be made in the next phase of this trial.\nJUDGMENT",

  "full_text": "I.\nOverview\n[1]\nO'Reilly, J.\n: The defendant Merck Frosst Canada & Co. holds the rights to a patented drug called norfloxacin. (On consent, the action against the other named defendant Merck & Co., Inc. was dismissed). In the early 1990s, Apotex Inc. tried to enter the market with a generic version of norfloxacin and, to that end, applied to the Minister of Health for a Notice of Compliance (NOC). Apotex alleged that it would not infringe the defendant's patent as it would either use norfloxacin raw material acquired by a third company, Novopharm Ltd., under a license from Merck, or it would produce norfloxacin by a method that would not infringe the patent.\n[2]\nMerck filed two applications to prohibit the Minister from issuing an NOC to Apotex. In respect of the first, relating to the use of a non-infringing method of making norfloxacin, Justice Marshall Rothstein granted the order Merck sought, and the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Apotex's appeal (\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n.\nv. Canada\n(\nMinister of National Health and Welfare\n), [1999] F.C.J. No. 209 (F.C.A.)).\n[3]\nIn respect of the second application, relating to the use of licensed material, Justice Sandra Simpson granted Merck its order in 1995 (\nMerck Frosst Canada\nInc\n. v.\nCanada (Minister of National Health and Welfare\n) (1995), 65 C.P.R. (3d) 483 (F.C.T.D.)). Apotex appealed her decision unsuccessfully to the Federal Court of Appeal (\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n. v.\nCanada (Minister of National Health and Welfare\n) (1996), 67 C.P.R. (3d) 455 (F.C.A.)). Apotex appealed again to the Supreme Court of Canada and succeeded in having the prohibition order set aside on July 9, 1998 (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). A week later, the Minister issued Apotex its NOC.\n[4]\nApotex now seeks compensation from Merck under s. 8 of the\nPatented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n, SOR/93-133, as amended by SOR/98-166 (relevant regulatory provisions are set out in Annexes I and II). Apotex argues that it is entitled to relief for having been kept out of the norfloxacin market for several years while the parties were in litigation.\n[5]\nTwo issues arise:\n1. Which version of the\nRegulations\napplies: the 1993 version, or the version that came into force in March 1998?\n2. If Merck had not sought an order prohibiting Apotex from obtaining an NOC, would Apotex have been able to get onto the market and, if so, when?\n[6]\nIn short, I find that the 1998 version of the\nRegulations\napplies to this action and that Apotex would have entered the market sooner had it not been prohibited by the operation of the\nRegulations\nand the order Merck obtained in 1995. Therefore, Apotex is entitled under the\nRegulations\nto obtain compensation from Merck. According to a bifurcation order, this phase of the trial is devoted solely to determining whether Apotex has a basis in fact and law for its claim. The quantum of damages will be determined in a subsequent phase.\nII.\nAnalysis\n1.\nWhich version of the Regulations applies: the 1993 version, or the version that came into force in March 1998\n?\n(a) Comparing the 1993 and 1998 versions of the\nRegulations\n[7]\nThe\nRegulations\nwere amended on March 12, 1998, about four months before the Supreme Court of Canada decided that Merck was not entitled to its prohibition order. The transitional rule in the 1998 Regulations (s. 9(6)) states that the amended remedies section (s. 8) applies to applications that were \"pending\" at the time the new\nRegulations\ncame into force.\n[8]\nThe 1998 version of s. 8 makes clear that a company that succeeded in obtaining a prohibition order that was later reversed on appeal must compensate the company that was prevented from getting onto the market for \"any loss\" suffered from the date a notice of compliance would otherwise have been granted to that company (or some other appropriate date) up until the date of the reversal.\n[9]\nApotex argues that Merck's application was \"pending\" at the time the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force because its merits had not been finally determined. That did not happen until the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on it in July 1998. Therefore, Apotex argues, the 1998\nRegulations\n, particularly the amended remedies clause, apply to Merck. Accordingly, Merck must compensate Apotex for its losses from the date Apotex would otherwise have obtained its NOC up until the date of the Supreme Court's ruling. Apotex says the former date is June 10, 1993 and the latter, obviously, is July 9, 1998.\n[10]\nMerck argues that the 1998\nRegulations\ndo not apply because its application for a prohibition order was no longer \"pending\" at the time the new\nRegulations\ncame into force. Its application, it submits, was decided by Justice Simpson in 1995. The\norder\nshe granted was appealed and its merits were not finally decided until the Supreme Court handed down its judgment, but the\napplication\nitself was no longer pending.\n[11]\nThis is an important question for the parties because the meaning of the remedies provision of the 1993\nRegulations\nis, by all accounts, murky. The 1993 version of s. 8 says that a patent holder is liable for all damage suffered by a second company seeking an NOC where the Minister delays issuing the NOC beyond the expiration of all patents that are the subject of a prohibition order. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) that accompanied the 1993\nRegulations\nstated that the Governor-in-Council intended to create liability for a patent holder, like Merck, when a generic competitor, like Apotex, has wrongly been kept out of the market:\n\"In addition, some generic products that turn out [not] to have infringed an original applicant's product or use patents could be delayed under these Regulations where patents listed in a patentee NOC application turn out either not to be valid or not to be infringed by the sale of a later applicant's drug. However, the frequency and costs associated with any such delays arising from these Regulations will be minimized by the fact that such a patentee will be liable for all damage suffered from the delay.\"\n[12]\nI must point out that the word \"not\" in the first sentence was not included in the original RIAS. However, this was an obvious oversight taking into account both the context, as well as the French version of the RIAS, which states that \"certains produits génériques qui ...\nne sont pas\ndes contrefaçons d'un brevet original pourrait avoir été retardée indûment ... \".\n[13]\nBoth parties presented plausible interpretations of what this section might mean. Apotex suggests that the 1993 and 1998 provisions, while differently worded, are identical in their effect. Merck maintains that the 1993 version creates no liability for it while the 1998 version creates absolute liability. Frankly, the meaning of the 1993 version eludes me. As Justice James Hugessen said of it:\n\"Section 8 is particularly obscure in its meaning. It appears to create a liability in the first person in the event that the Minister should comply with the 30 month prohibition in circumstances where subsection 7(2) specifically provides that that prohibition shall have ceased to apply. Fortunately, we are not required to interpret it on this appeal. (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at 316)\"\n[14]\nIt seems reasonably clear from the RIAS that the Governor-in-Council's original intention was to create liability along the lines of what was promulgated in the 1998\nRegulations\n. The 1998 RIAS states that the purpose of the amendment was to provide a \"clearer indication\" \"as to the circumstances in which damages could be awarded to a generic manufacturer to compensate for loss suffered by reason of delayed market entry of its drug\". From this, it seems the original intention was to create liability for patent holders where generic companies were denied early entry to the market, and that the purpose of the 1998 amendment was simply to make this clearer. However, in 1993, the Governor-in-Council apparently did not find words to express its intention. In 1998, it did.\n[15]\nIn any case, I do not have to determine definitively what the 1993\nRegulations\nmean because, in my view, the 1998 version applies here. In other words, I conclude that Merck's application was, indeed, \"pending\" in March 1998 and, therefore, according to the transitional rule, the 1998\nRegulations\napply to this action.\n(b) What is a \"pending\" application?\n[16]\nObviously, the word \"pending\" must take its meaning from the context in which it is used. Merck argues that one must look to the other words in the 1998\nRegulations\nfor guidance. It points out that the transitional rule (s. 9(6)) refers to applications pending at the time the\nRegulations\ncame into force. The remedies section itself (s. 8) provides relief where an application \"is withdrawn or discontinued\" or \"is dismissed by the court hearing the application\" or if \"an order preventing the Minister from issuing a notice of compliance ... is reversed on appeal\". In Merck's submission, when the transitional rule speaks of an application \"pending\" it is referring to the time period prior to an application being withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. It is not referring to the point in time after the application has been granted and a prohibition order has been issued, even if the order is reversed on appeal. Had the provision been intended to apply to orders whose merits were pending before appellate courts, the provision would have used the word \"order\" not \"application\".\n[17]\nMerck further argues that to interpret the 1998\nRegulations\nas applying to these circumstances would be to give them a retrospective effect. There is no specific authority given to the Governor-in-Council in the\nPatent Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, to enact retrospective regulations. Therefore, if I interpret the transitional rule as purporting to apply to these circumstances, Merck says I must find that it is beyond the regulatory authority of the Governor-in-Council. In support of that argument, Merck asserts that application of the 1998 remedies provision would interfere with its vested rights.\n[18]\nIn my view, Merck's application for a prohibition order remained pending when the 1998 Regulations came into force. Accordingly, it is s. 8 of the 1998\nRegulations\nthat defines the remedies available in the circumstances. As I read it, this provision does not operate retrospectively and, even if it did, it does interfere with any vested rights of Merck.\n[19]\nIn general, a pending matter is one in which further steps can be taken in it (\nIn re Clagett's Estate\n;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  finally decided - \"[t] he suit does not expire with the decision given by the trial judge\". Rather, a proceeding is \"still alive, still pending until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.) at paras. 13, 20).\n[20]\nWithin the context of the 1998\nRegulations\n, Justice Roger Hughes found that proceedings are pending if they are \"not yet finished\" and \"there is no final judgment\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 38). By contrast, a final judgment is one that is rendered when \"all appeals have disposed of the matter\" (para. 39). By that reasoning, Merck's application was still pending when the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force; the Supreme Court of Canada was still seized of the matter and had not rendered a final decision on the merits of Merck's application.\n[21]\nJustice Hughes noted that, in the case before him, the application was not pending at the time the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force. The Court had issued a prohibition order and an appeal from that decision had been dismissed well before the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force on March 12, 1998. The matter was not pending; it was final. Therefore, the 1993\nRegulations\napplied, not the 1998 version. At a later point, in 1999, the order was set aside by Justice Barbara Reed who, at the same time, dismissed the underlying application. Justice Hughes found that the dismissal of the application would have triggered the remedy provision of the 1998\nRegulations\n, had they applied.\n[22]\nI note that in the matter before me the Supreme Court of Canada specifically dismissed Merck's application for an order of prohibition in its July 9, 1998 decision when it allowed Apotex's appeal. Both the dismissal of the application and the reversal of the decision on which the prohibition order was based trigger liability under the 1998 version of the\nRegulations\n. If Merck's application had not then been \"pending\", there would have been no reason for the Supreme Court to dismiss it.\n[23]\nAs mentioned, the word \"pending\" takes its meaning from the context in which it is used. Merck rightly points out that, for purposes of determining rights of appeal under s. 27 of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, C. F-7, s. 1; 2002, c. 8, s. 14, an application would not be pending after the Federal Court had ruled on it. It would be considered a final decision and amenable to appeal. In this case, the Federal Court decided Merck's application for prohibition in 1995 and, for purposes of Merck's right of appeal, the Court's decision was a final determination. In that context, one could not say that the application was pending.\n[24]\nHowever, looking at the broader context, it could not be said, once appealed, that the merits of Merck's application had been finally determined. Its application was \"pending\" in the sense that its legal foundation was very much a live issue before the Supreme Court of Canada when the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect.\n[25]\nMerck argues that the reference to an \"application\" in the transitional rule (s. 9(6)) corresponds only to the scenarios outlined in s. 8 in which an application is withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. It does not extend to an order being reversed on appeal. By this interpretation, an application would be pending only up to the point when it is withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. An application that gave rise to a prohibition order could not be said to be pending, even if appealed, Merck says. If the intention had been for the 1998\nRegulations\nto apply to orders under appeal, the transitional rule would have used clearer language, such as \"section 8 applies to all ongoing proceedings relating to the issuance of a prohibition order\".\n[26]\nI am not persuaded by this argument. First, as mentioned, the meaning of \"pending\" is reasonably clear and I must assume the drafters of the transitional rule would have been aware of its breadth. Second, as the 1998 RIAS describes, the purpose of the revised remedies provision was to clarify the liability of patent holders and not, as Merck suggests, to create an entirely new basis for it. It would not be unfair in that context to apply the amended provision to all cases that were in the system at that point and no particular reason to treat cases in which a prohibition order was under appeal differently from those at an earlier stage of litigation.\n[27]\nMerck relies on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). There, the Court found that when the\nRegulations\nrefer to an application being \"finally dismissed by the court\" they mean dismissed by the Federal Court, not the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada. Accordingly, Merck says, an application should be considered pending only when it is before the Federal Court. I note, however, that the word \"court\" is defined in the\nRegulations\nspecifically to mean the Federal Court. The passage in issue in that case clearly related to the initial decision by the applications judge. The\nRegulations\nhave since been amended to refer to the court \"hearing the application\" (s. 7(4), s. 8). However, in the transitional rule in s. 9(6) of the 1998\nRegulations\n, the word \"court\" is not used. The provision merely refers to an \"application pending\" when the\nRegulations\ncame into force. It does not refer to an \"application pending before the court\" or to an \"application pending before the court hearing the application\". When the Governor-in-Council wished to be specific about the relevant stage of proceedings, it used specific language.\n[28]\nFurther, I do not interpret the 1998\nRegulations\nas interfering with Merck's vested rights. At best, before the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect, Merck had the right to have its liability to Apotex determined according to the 1993 version of s. 8, the meaning of which is wholly uncertain. This does not amount to a vested right. Merck had the right to argue that the 1993 version of s. 8 did not impose liability upon it but the outcome of such an argument is unknowable. No court has been required to interpret the former s. 8 and, it follows, no court has found that companies  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's circumstances were not liable to generic manufacturers kept out of the market by virtue of the operation of the\nRegulations\n. Merck had the right to urge a favourable interpretation of the\nRegulations\non an attentive court, but no more. As mentioned, Merck submits that it went from having no liability under the 1993\nRegulations\nto having absolute liability under the 1998\nRegulations\n. In other words, it made its application to keep Apotex out of the market knowing that there would be no adverse economic consequences of doing so, even if it failed to obtain its prohibition order or if the order was later overturned. I think Merck overstates its case. In my view, it went from having uncertain liability in 1993 to having potential liability in 1998. It did not give up a vested right, only an untested argument. Merck repeatedly asserted that s. 8 of the 1993\nRegulations\nwas equivalent to an undertaking in damages and yet, at the same time, maintained that it not impose any obligations on Merck. I find this position unpersuasive. Accordingly, I cannot find that the 1998\nRegulations\nhave an impermissible retrospective effect, beyond the competence of the Governor-in-Council.\n[29]\nSection 8 sets out the liability of a patent holder for losses of a generic competitor who was kept out of the market by virtue of the operation of the\nRegulations\n. That liability, on the facts of this case, was triggered by the Supreme Court of Canada's dismissal of Merck's application and its reversal of the prohibition order. That event did not take place until after the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect. Apotex's s. 8 claim could not been initiated until after the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in July 1998 and the remedies provision of the 1998\nRegulations\n, quite naturally, applied to it. Whether the 1993\nRegulations\nwould have given Apotex any relief is unknown, but there is nothing peculiar or unfair about Apotex initiating its action on the basis of the remedies provision then in force.\n[30]\nOne could say that, in this case, the 1998\nRegulations\ngovern events that straddle the date of its coming into force. Section 8 defines the scope of a patent holder's liability according to two dates - first, the date when the second company would have obtained its NOC but for the operation of the\nRegulations\nand, second, the date when the patent holder's prohibition order was overturned on appeal (or when its application was withdrawn or dismissed). In this case, the first date precedes the coming into force of the\nRegulations\n; the second date follows it. Justice Lebel described this situation as follows:\n\"New legislation does not operate retroactively when it is applied to a situation made up of a series of events that occurred before and after it came into force or with respect to legal effects straddling the date it came into force. If events are under way when it comes into force, the new legislation will apply in accordance with the principle of immediate application, that is, it governs the future development of the legal situation. If the legal effects of the situation are already occurring when the new legislation comes into force, the principle of retrospective effect applies. According to this principle, the new legislation governs the future consequences of events that happened before it came into force but does not modify effects that occurred before that date.\" (\nÉpiciers  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 46).\n[31]\nEven on this characterization of the\nRegulations\n, I cannot see any interference with any vested rights Merck might have held. Therefore, to the extent the\nRegulations\ncan be described as retrospective, I see no basis for Merck's argument that they run afoul of the general rule that subordinate legislation cannot operate retrospectively unless the enabling legislation clearly authorizes it.\n[32]\nIn conclusion, I find that the 1998\nRegulations\napply in this case. Merck is therefore liable to Apotex for \"any loss suffered during the period\" from the date Apotex would otherwise have obtained an NOC until the date Merck's application was dismissed. I come now to the second issue:\n2.\nIf Merck had not sought an order prohibiting Apotex from obtaining a NOC, would Apotex have been able to get onto the market and, if so, when?\n(a) Burden of Proof\n[33]\nIn essence, I must decide if Apotex did, in fact, suffer a loss by having been kept out of the market by virtue of the prohibition proceedings Merck had initiated. This requires me to consider what would have happened if Merck had not done so.\n[34]\nApotex argues that it does not have to prove on a balance of probabilities that, but for the operation of the\nRegulations\n, it would have entered the norfloxacin market. Rather, it need only show that it had a reasonable chance of doing so. The cases relied on by Apotex for this proposition deal with the calculation of damages where courts must consider the likelihood of future contingencies that might affect quantum (e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 243; 132 W.A.C. 243;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). But here we are considering Merck's liability for damages, not the quantification of those damages. At this stage, in my view, Apotex must show on a balance of probabilities that it was prevented from getting into the norfloxacin market because of Merck's prohibition application. As Justice Norris said in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Apotex must \"establish on the balance of probabilities that the chance of making a profit was real and not fanciful\" (para. 5(e)). This is consistent with the approach taken by Justice Johanne Gauthier in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 762. In the circumstances, Apotex must show, at a minimum, that it had access to a supply of norfloxacin. Without that, its assertion that it was kept out of the market by Merck's prohibition application would be fanciful, not real.\n[35]\nSection 8 provides relief within a defined period, beginning on the date the Minister would have issued an NOC to the generic manufacturer (unless some other date is more appropriate) and ending on the date the prohibition order was overturned. In this case, the relevant time frame is between June 10, 1993 and July 9, 1998. There is no basis in law for choosing a more appropriate beginning date, although that is not to say that Apotex, as a matter of fact, started suffering a loss on June 10, 1993.\n[36]\nAs mentioned above, this phase of the trial is confined to determining whether Apotex has shown a basis in fact and law for its claim. Above, I found that s. 8 of the 1998 Regulations provides a basis in law for Apotex's claim. Now, I must decide whether Apotex has proved a factual basis for it - that is, whether it would actually have been able to enter the norfloxacin market before 1998 and, if so, when.\n[37]\nIn summary, Merck argues that Apotex has failed to meet that burden because Apotex has not proved that it had an available supply of non-infringing material that would have permitted it to get product on the market.\n(c) Factors Affecting Market Entry\n[38]\nI need only consider whether Apotex could have entered the market with material obtained from Novopharm under Novopharm's compulsory license with Merck. The other possible route, through use of norfloxacin manufactured by a non-infringing process, was foreclosed by the decisions of Justice Rothstein and the Federal Court of Appeal, where it was found that the process proposed by Apotex actually did infringe the patent. It was also held up, as a matter of fact, by the difficulties that Apotex's supplier, Delmar Chemicals Inc., encountered in producing norfloxacin by an allegedly non-infringing process without impurities.\n[39]\nApotex's alternative was to use material obtained through Novopharm. Novopharm had a compulsory license from Merck for norfloxacin and had a reciprocal agreement with Apotex to supply licensed material on request. The Federal Court of Appeal concluded that this supply agreement amounted to an improper sublicense but the Supreme Court of Canada found otherwise in its decision of July 9, 1998. Therefore, the supply agreement created a means by which Apotex could, at least in theory, enter the norfloxacin market without infringing Merck's patent rights.\n[40]\nIn my view, however, Apotex was not in a position to enter the norfloxacin market in June 1993 even if there had been no prohibition application by Merck. There are two main reasons for this:\n1. Apotex did not have a willing supplier.\n2. Apotex did not have a willing partner in Novopharm, notwithstanding their mutual supply agreement.\n[41]\nOn the other hand, as discussed below, Apotex probably would have been able to enter the market by July 1996, when it could have asked Novopharm to obtain raw material from a foreign source, as it did in 1998, after Apotex received its NOC. The question, then, is whether Apotex could have entered the market prior to July 1996, notwithstanding its difficulties getting cooperation from its intended supplier, Delmar, and putative partner, Novopharm.\n(d) Problems with Supply\n[42]\nApotex submits that in 1993 it had a supplier who was ready and willing to provide Apotex with norfloxacin. Apotex was a minority shareholder in Delmar Chemicals Inc. and, accordingly, Apotex was entitled to request Delmar to provide it with material so long as doing so would not strain Delmar's capacity. However, Delmar was clearly uncomfortable with the arrangements Apotex was proposing.\n[43]\nApotex purported to order norfloxacin directly from Delmar on Novopharm's behalf. Delmar raised concerns about Apotex's proposal and, in 1995, sought a legal opinion about it. Thereafter, it agreed to supply norfloxacin only if it obtained indemnification from Apotex and Novopharm, and received a direct request from Novopharm. Apotex provided an indemnity, but not until October 27, 1997. Delmar never did receive an order from Novopharm or any indemnity from it.\n[44]\nClearly, Delmar would not have been ready, in June 1993, to start providing Apotex with norfloxacin by way of Apotex's supply agreement with Novopharm. At a minimum, even if Apotex had its NOC in hand, it would have taken several months to arrive at an arrangement that would have been satisfactory to Delmar.\n(e) Problems with Novopharm\n[45]\nSince October 15, 1991, Novopharm had a compulsory license from Merck in respect of norfloxacin. The licence entitled Novopharm to make, use or sell norfloxacin as of July 2, 1993, and to import it after July 2, 1996. Novopharm entered into a supply agreement with Apotex on November 27, 1992. Under the agreement, Novopharm and Apotex each agreed to supply the other with pharmaceutical ingredients if one of them had a license and the other did not. In this case, since Novopharm had a license for norfloxacin, Apotex was entitled, it argues, to ask Novopharm to supply norfloxacin to Apotex  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's request.\n[46]\nHowever, it took Apotex some time actually to convince Novopharm to go along with the arrangement. In April 1993, Apotex advised Novopharm that it intended to rely on their supply agreement to obtain norfloxacin. Details about quantities were left to a later date. Novopharm replied by asking Apotex to confirm whether Novopharm's license remained valid and there were no other patents of concern, and to address an outstanding grievance between Novopharm and Apotex about another drug (enalapril). Apotex reminded Novopharm about the terms of their mutual supply agreement, and undertook to indemnify Novopharm for any liability it might incur in responding to Apotex's request (which was part of the supply agreement anyway). Novopharm responded by stating that its license was no longer valid and, therefore, could not be relied on by Apotex under the supply agreement. Further, it pointed out that Eli Lilly was challenging the legality of the supply agreement and that Novopharm expected Apotex to reimburse Novopharm for the legal costs of defending it.\n[47]\nThe correspondence between Apotex and Novopharm continued, to and fro, for many months, indeed years. It was not until November 16, 1995 that Apotex made a formal request to Novopharm to supply it with norfloxacin. In particular, Apotex asked Novopharm to arrange for the manufacture of 2,000 kilograms of norfloxacin at Delmar. Novopharm refused. It said that the supply agreement had been terminated and that Apotex's proposal to deal directly with Delmar rendered Novopharm's license invalid. This position was backed up by Novopharm's lawyers.\n[48]\nThings remained quiet until 1998, until after the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its decision finding the supply agreement between Apotex and Novopharm was not an invalid sublicense and, accordingly, dismissing Merck's application for an order of prohibition. The Supreme Court of Canada issued its decision on July 9, 1998. Apotex received its NOC a week later. It then demanded material from Novopharm pursuant to the supply agreement. Within weeks, Novopharm issued purchase orders for the requested material. On August 18, 1998, Apotex received its first material from Novopharm, who had obtained the material from Cipla, a foreign source. More foreign material arrived in September. Apotex entered the market with its first sales in September 1998. Apotex received more foreign material throughout the autumn and winter of 1998-1999.\n[49]\nNovopharm was not what one could call a willing partner. While it did supply material  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's request, its compliance was no doubt a product in part of legal proceedings underway between the parties. Those proceedings led to a decision of Justice Ferrier in the Ontario Court (General Division) in January 1999, in which he upheld the supply agreement (in relation to another drug, nizatidine. See Court File No. 98-CV-157772, January 28, 1999).\n[50]\nBased on these events, Apotex suggests that certainly as of July 2, 1996, when it would have been permitted to obtain material through foreign sources, through the combination of Novopharm's license and the supply agreement between Novopharm and Apotex, without infringing Merck's patent rights, it was in a position to enter the market within weeks. Foreign sources were available during the relevant time frame.\n[51]\nAs for domestic sources, Apotex maintains that Novopharm would have obtained material from Delmar on Apotex's request. As discussed above, Delmar would have required a direct request from Novopharm and indemnity from Novopharm against any potential patent liability. Apotex suggests that those conditions would have been met by Novopharm because they were covered by the supply agreement between Apotex and Novopharm. In turn, Novopharm would have been indemnified by Apotex. Delmar was in a position to supply norfloxacin; the raw materials were readily available in 1993. So, Delmar-produced norfloxacin could have been put on the market by Apotex soon after Apotex received its NOC, had the Minister issued it in June 1993.\n[52]\nMerck notes, however, that Apotex made no request of Novopharm in respect of norfloxacin until November 16, 1995. Dr. Barry Sherman for Apotex purported to direct Novopharm to arrange for the manufacture of 2000 kilograms of norfloxacin at Delmar. In fact, the draft letter he attached stated that Novopharm wished to manufacture norfloxacin at Delmar's facilities. Merck notes that Novopharm's licence was for manufacture of norfloxacin, not purchase from another manufacturer. Therefore, it was important for the parties to make arrangements that would respect the licence. The license included many terms but did not expressly include the right to have norfloxacin made by another manufacturer and sold to others. In my view, however, Novopharm's license was broad enough to permit manufacture of norfloxacin by an agent of Novopharm and sold to Apotex to make a medicine. As mentioned, Novopharm raised numerous objections to the arrangements Apotex was proposing, but none of them related to any limitations on its license.\n[53]\nMerck also argues that Apotex's NOA did not match its new drug submission (NDS). It suggests that Apotex would not have managed to have its norfloxacin approved in 1993, notwithstanding the Minister's letter to the contrary. In its original NDS in 1990, Apotex named Chemo Iberica as the supplier of its active ingredient. It amended the NDS in 1992 to substitute Torcan Chemical Ltd. as the source. As mentioned, the Torcan process was a more complicated four-step process compared to the patented two-step process. Nevertheless, the Torcan process was found to be an obvious variation and an infringement of Merck's patent (by Justice Rothstein, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 144 F.T.R. 299 (T.D.)) upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal,\nApotex Inc\n. v.\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n., [1999] F.C.J. No. 206; 236 N.R. 179 (F.C.A.)). So Apotex could not obtain an NOC for norfloxacin by the Torcan process.\n[54]\nMerck further submits that Apotex could not have obtained an NOC for norfloxacin made by Novopharm at Delmar using the patented process because its NDS referred to a different process. The Drug Master File (DMF) would have had to be amended, as well as the NDS, before an NOC could issue. Either way, Merck argues, Apotex could not obtain an NOC at any time prior to July 9, 1998. I am not persuaded by Merck's submissions on this point. Apotex could have made changes in source and process of manufacture relatively easily, either by informal means, particularly prior to 1994. Thereafter, Apotex would have had to advise Health Canada of a notifiable change. Substituting Delmar as the supplier would have been easily done as Delmar was already an approved manufacturer.\n[55]\nFinally, Merck argues that Apotex's statement of claim only alleges that Delmar would have allowed Novopharm actually to manufacture norfloxacin at its plant, and makes no reference to the possibility of Apotex having access to foreign material. Paragraph 23 of the statement of claim states that Delmar was ready \"to enter an arrangement with Novopharm to manufacture norfloxacin at its plant\". Delmar clearly would not have allowed Novopharm employees to enter its plant and start making a drug. However, it would have permitted an arrangement whereby Novopharm could oversee production at Delmar. In my view, this potential arrangement is contemplated by paragraph 23.\n[56]\nAs for foreign sources, paragraph 22 of the statement of claim mentions Novopharm's license which permitted it to manufacture norfloxacin as of July 2, 1993 and to import it as of July 2, 1996. In my view, this allegation permitted Apotex to lead evidence about foreign sources. However, as discussed above, Apotex would have had access to domestic material from Delmar in any case through the supply agreement with Novopharm. It was not dependent on foreign material.\n[57]\nThe problems Apotex would likely have had getting Novopharm's cooperation would have slowed, not stopped, Apotex from getting on the market. As with the supply problems with Delmar, I am satisfied it would have taken Apotex up to a year to establish an arrangement with Novopharm. Litigation might well have been necessary.\nIII. Conclusion and Disposition\n[58]\nIn my view, therefore, Apotex has met its burden of proving that it would have entered the norfloxacin market before July 9, 1998 but for the operation of the\nRegulations\n. However, taking account of the problems with supply from Delmar, and with the supply agreement with Novopharm, I conclude that Apotex would not have been able to get on the market until one full year after it would have received its NOC, that is, as of June 10, 1994. Therefore, Apotex is entitled to be compensated for the losses it suffered between that date and July 9, 1998. I will allow Apotex's action against Merck under s. 8 of the\nRegulations\n, with costs. Determination of the quantum of damages will be made in the next phase of this trial.\nJUDGMENT\n[59]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT IS that:\n1. Apotex Inc.'s action against Merck Frosst Canada & Co. under s. 8 of the\nPatented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n, SOR/98-166 is allowed, with costs.\n2.

  "full_text_en": "[0]\nI.\nOverview\n\n[1]\nO'Reilly, J.\n: The defendant Merck Frosst Canada & Co. holds the rights to a patented drug called norfloxacin. (On consent, the action against the other named defendant Merck & Co., Inc. was dismissed). In the early 1990s, Apotex Inc. tried to enter the market with a generic version of norfloxacin and, to that end, applied to the Minister of Health for a Notice of Compliance (NOC). Apotex alleged that it would not infringe the defendant's patent as it would either use norfloxacin raw material acquired by a third company, Novopharm Ltd., under a license from Merck, or it would produce norfloxacin by a method that would not infringe the patent.\n\n[2]\nMerck filed two applications to prohibit the Minister from issuing an NOC to Apotex. In respect of the first, relating to the use of a non-infringing method of making norfloxacin, Justice Marshall Rothstein granted the order Merck sought, and the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Apotex's appeal (\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n.\nv. Canada\n(\nMinister of National Health and Welfare\n), [1999] F.C.J. No. 209 (F.C.A.)).\n\n[3]\nIn respect of the second application, relating to the use of licensed material, Justice Sandra Simpson granted Merck its order in 1995 (\nMerck Frosst Canada\nInc\n. v.\nCanada (Minister of National Health and Welfare\n) (1995), 65 C.P.R. (3d) 483 (F.C.T.D.)). Apotex appealed her decision unsuccessfully to the Federal Court of Appeal (\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n. v.\nCanada (Minister of National Health and Welfare\n) (1996), 67 C.P.R. (3d) 455 (F.C.A.)). Apotex appealed again to the Supreme Court of Canada and succeeded in having the prohibition order set aside on July 9, 1998 (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). A week later, the Minister issued Apotex its NOC.\n\n[4]\nApotex now seeks compensation from Merck under s. 8 of the\nPatented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n, SOR/93-133, as amended by SOR/98-166 (relevant regulatory provisions are set out in Annexes I and II). Apotex argues that it is entitled to relief for having been kept out of the norfloxacin market for several years while the parties were in litigation.\n\n[5]\nTwo issues arise:\n1. Which version of the\nRegulations\napplies: the 1993 version, or the version that came into force in March 1998?\n2. If Merck had not sought an order prohibiting Apotex from obtaining an NOC, would Apotex have been able to get onto the market and, if so, when?\n\n[6]\nIn short, I find that the 1998 version of the\nRegulations\napplies to this action and that Apotex would have entered the market sooner had it not been prohibited by the operation of the\nRegulations\nand the order Merck obtained in 1995. Therefore, Apotex is entitled under the\nRegulations\nto obtain compensation from Merck. According to a bifurcation order, this phase of the trial is devoted solely to determining whether Apotex has a basis in fact and law for its claim. The quantum of damages will be determined in a subsequent phase.\nII.\nAnalysis\n1.\nWhich version of the Regulations applies: the 1993 version, or the version that came into force in March 1998\n?\n(a) Comparing the 1993 and 1998 versions of the\nRegulations\n\n[7]\nThe\nRegulations\nwere amended on March 12, 1998, about four months before the Supreme Court of Canada decided that Merck was not entitled to its prohibition order. The transitional rule in the 1998 Regulations (s. 9(6)) states that the amended remedies section (s. 8) applies to applications that were \"pending\" at the time the new\nRegulations\ncame into force.\n\n[8]\nThe 1998 version of s. 8 makes clear that a company that succeeded in obtaining a prohibition order that was later reversed on appeal must compensate the company that was prevented from getting onto the market for \"any loss\" suffered from the date a notice of compliance would otherwise have been granted to that company (or some other appropriate date) up until the date of the reversal.\n\n[9]\nApotex argues that Merck's application was \"pending\" at the time the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force because its merits had not been finally determined. That did not happen until the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on it in July 1998. Therefore, Apotex argues, the 1998\nRegulations\n, particularly the amended remedies clause, apply to Merck. Accordingly, Merck must compensate Apotex for its losses from the date Apotex would otherwise have obtained its NOC up until the date of the Supreme Court's ruling. Apotex says the former date is June 10, 1993 and the latter, obviously, is July 9, 1998.\n\n[10]\nMerck argues that the 1998\nRegulations\ndo not apply because its application for a prohibition order was no longer \"pending\" at the time the new\nRegulations\ncame into force. Its application, it submits, was decided by Justice Simpson in 1995. The\norder\nshe granted was appealed and its merits were not finally decided until the Supreme Court handed down its judgment, but the\napplication\nitself was no longer pending.\n\n[11]\nThis is an important question for the parties because the meaning of the remedies provision of the 1993\nRegulations\nis, by all accounts, murky. The 1993 version of s. 8 says that a patent holder is liable for all damage suffered by a second company seeking an NOC where the Minister delays issuing the NOC beyond the expiration of all patents that are the subject of a prohibition order. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) that accompanied the 1993\nRegulations\nstated that the Governor-in-Council intended to create liability for a patent holder, like Merck, when a generic competitor, like Apotex, has wrongly been kept out of the market:\n\"In addition, some generic products that turn out [not] to have infringed an original applicant's product or use patents could be delayed under these Regulations where patents listed in a patentee NOC application turn out either not to be valid or not to be infringed by the sale of a later applicant's drug. However, the frequency and costs associated with any such delays arising from these Regulations will be minimized by the fact that such a patentee will be liable for all damage suffered from the delay.\"\n\n[12]\nI must point out that the word \"not\" in the first sentence was not included in the original RIAS. However, this was an obvious oversight taking into account both the context, as well as the French version of the RIAS, which states that \"certains produits génériques qui ...\nne sont pas\ndes contrefaçons d'un brevet original pourrait avoir été retardée indûment ... \".\n\n[13]\nBoth parties presented plausible interpretations of what this section might mean. Apotex suggests that the 1993 and 1998 provisions, while differently worded, are identical in their effect. Merck maintains that the 1993 version creates no liability for it while the 1998 version creates absolute liability. Frankly, the meaning of the 1993 version eludes me. As Justice James Hugessen said of it:\n\"Section 8 is particularly obscure in its meaning. It appears to create a liability in the first person in the event that the Minister should comply with the 30 month prohibition in circumstances where subsection 7(2) specifically provides that that prohibition shall have ceased to apply. Fortunately, we are not required to interpret it on this appeal. (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at 316)\"\n\n[14]\nIt seems reasonably clear from the RIAS that the Governor-in-Council's original intention was to create liability along the lines of what was promulgated in the 1998\nRegulations\n. The 1998 RIAS states that the purpose of the amendment was to provide a \"clearer indication\" \"as to the circumstances in which damages could be awarded to a generic manufacturer to compensate for loss suffered by reason of delayed market entry of its drug\". From this, it seems the original intention was to create liability for patent holders where generic companies were denied early entry to the market, and that the purpose of the 1998 amendment was simply to make this clearer. However, in 1993, the Governor-in-Council apparently did not find words to express its intention. In 1998, it did.\n\n[15]\nIn any case, I do not have to determine definitively what the 1993\nRegulations\nmean because, in my view, the 1998 version applies here. In other words, I conclude that Merck's application was, indeed, \"pending\" in March 1998 and, therefore, according to the transitional rule, the 1998\nRegulations\napply to this action.\n(b) What is a \"pending\" application?\n\n[16]\nObviously, the word \"pending\" must take its meaning from the context in which it is used. Merck argues that one must look to the other words in the 1998\nRegulations\nfor guidance. It points out that the transitional rule (s. 9(6)) refers to applications pending at the time the\nRegulations\ncame into force. The remedies section itself (s. 8) provides relief where an application \"is withdrawn or discontinued\" or \"is dismissed by the court hearing the application\" or if \"an order preventing the Minister from issuing a notice of compliance ... is reversed on appeal\". In Merck's submission, when the transitional rule speaks of an application \"pending\" it is referring to the time period prior to an application being withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. It is not referring to the point in time after the application has been granted and a prohibition order has been issued, even if the order is reversed on appeal. Had the provision been intended to apply to orders whose merits were pending before appellate courts, the provision would have used the word \"order\" not \"application\".\n\n[17]\nMerck further argues that to interpret the 1998\nRegulations\nas applying to these circumstances would be to give them a retrospective effect. There is no specific authority given to the Governor-in-Council in the\nPatent Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, to enact retrospective regulations. Therefore, if I interpret the transitional rule as purporting to apply to these circumstances, Merck says I must find that it is beyond the regulatory authority of the Governor-in-Council. In support of that argument, Merck asserts that application of the 1998 remedies provision would interfere with its vested rights.\n\n[18]\nIn my view, Merck's application for a prohibition order remained pending when the 1998 Regulations came into force. Accordingly, it is s. 8 of the 1998\nRegulations\nthat defines the remedies available in the circumstances. As I read it, this provision does not operate retrospectively and, even if it did, it does interfere with any vested rights of Merck.\n\n[19]\nIn general, a pending matter is one in which further steps can be taken in it (\nIn re Clagett's Estate\n;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  finally decided - \"[t] he suit does not expire with the decision given by the trial judge\". Rather, a proceeding is \"still alive, still pending until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.) at paras. 13, 20).\n\n[20]\nWithin the context of the 1998\nRegulations\n, Justice Roger Hughes found that proceedings are pending if they are \"not yet finished\" and \"there is no final judgment\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 38). By contrast, a final judgment is one that is rendered when \"all appeals have disposed of the matter\" (para. 39). By that reasoning, Merck's application was still pending when the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force; the Supreme Court of Canada was still seized of the matter and had not rendered a final decision on the merits of Merck's application.\n\n[21]\nJustice Hughes noted that, in the case before him, the application was not pending at the time the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force. The Court had issued a prohibition order and an appeal from that decision had been dismissed well before the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into force on March 12, 1998. The matter was not pending; it was final. Therefore, the 1993\nRegulations\napplied, not the 1998 version. At a later point, in 1999, the order was set aside by Justice Barbara Reed who, at the same time, dismissed the underlying application. Justice Hughes found that the dismissal of the application would have triggered the remedy provision of the 1998\nRegulations\n, had they applied.\n\n[22]\nI note that in the matter before me the Supreme Court of Canada specifically dismissed Merck's application for an order of prohibition in its July 9, 1998 decision when it allowed Apotex's appeal. Both the dismissal of the application and the reversal of the decision on which the prohibition order was based trigger liability under the 1998 version of the\nRegulations\n. If Merck's application had not then been \"pending\", there would have been no reason for the Supreme Court to dismiss it.\n\n[23]\nAs mentioned, the word \"pending\" takes its meaning from the context in which it is used. Merck rightly points out that, for purposes of determining rights of appeal under s. 27 of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, C. F-7, s. 1; 2002, c. 8, s. 14, an application would not be pending after the Federal Court had ruled on it. It would be considered a final decision and amenable to appeal. In this case, the Federal Court decided Merck's application for prohibition in 1995 and, for purposes of Merck's right of appeal, the Court's decision was a final determination. In that context, one could not say that the application was pending.\n\n[24]\nHowever, looking at the broader context, it could not be said, once appealed, that the merits of Merck's application had been finally determined. Its application was \"pending\" in the sense that its legal foundation was very much a live issue before the Supreme Court of Canada when the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect.\n\n[25]\nMerck argues that the reference to an \"application\" in the transitional rule (s. 9(6)) corresponds only to the scenarios outlined in s. 8 in which an application is withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. It does not extend to an order being reversed on appeal. By this interpretation, an application would be pending only up to the point when it is withdrawn, discontinued or dismissed. An application that gave rise to a prohibition order could not be said to be pending, even if appealed, Merck says. If the intention had been for the 1998\nRegulations\nto apply to orders under appeal, the transitional rule would have used clearer language, such as \"section 8 applies to all ongoing proceedings relating to the issuance of a prohibition order\".\n\n[26]\nI am not persuaded by this argument. First, as mentioned, the meaning of \"pending\" is reasonably clear and I must assume the drafters of the transitional rule would have been aware of its breadth. Second, as the 1998 RIAS describes, the purpose of the revised remedies provision was to clarify the liability of patent holders and not, as Merck suggests, to create an entirely new basis for it. It would not be unfair in that context to apply the amended provision to all cases that were in the system at that point and no particular reason to treat cases in which a prohibition order was under appeal differently from those at an earlier stage of litigation.\n\n[27]\nMerck relies on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). There, the Court found that when the\nRegulations\nrefer to an application being \"finally dismissed by the court\" they mean dismissed by the Federal Court, not the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada. Accordingly, Merck says, an application should be considered pending only when it is before the Federal Court. I note, however, that the word \"court\" is defined in the\nRegulations\nspecifically to mean the Federal Court. The passage in issue in that case clearly related to the initial decision by the applications judge. The\nRegulations\nhave since been amended to refer to the court \"hearing the application\" (s. 7(4), s. 8). However, in the transitional rule in s. 9(6) of the 1998\nRegulations\n, the word \"court\" is not used. The provision merely refers to an \"application pending\" when the\nRegulations\ncame into force. It does not refer to an \"application pending before the court\" or to an \"application pending before the court hearing the application\". When the Governor-in-Council wished to be specific about the relevant stage of proceedings, it used specific language.\n\n[28]\nFurther, I do not interpret the 1998\nRegulations\nas interfering with Merck's vested rights. At best, before the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect, Merck had the right to have its liability to Apotex determined according to the 1993 version of s. 8, the meaning of which is wholly uncertain. This does not amount to a vested right. Merck had the right to argue that the 1993 version of s. 8 did not impose liability upon it but the outcome of such an argument is unknowable. No court has been required to interpret the former s. 8 and, it follows, no court has found that companies  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's circumstances were not liable to generic manufacturers kept out of the market by virtue of the operation of the\nRegulations\n. Merck had the right to urge a favourable interpretation of the\nRegulations\non an attentive court, but no more. As mentioned, Merck submits that it went from having no liability under the 1993\nRegulations\nto having absolute liability under the 1998\nRegulations\n. In other words, it made its application to keep Apotex out of the market knowing that there would be no adverse economic consequences of doing so, even if it failed to obtain its prohibition order or if the order was later overturned. I think Merck overstates its case. In my view, it went from having uncertain liability in 1993 to having potential liability in 1998. It did not give up a vested right, only an untested argument. Merck repeatedly asserted that s. 8 of the 1993\nRegulations\nwas equivalent to an undertaking in damages and yet, at the same time, maintained that it not impose any obligations on Merck. I find this position unpersuasive. Accordingly, I cannot find that the 1998\nRegulations\nhave an impermissible retrospective effect, beyond the competence of the Governor-in-Council.\n\n[29]\nSection 8 sets out the liability of a patent holder for losses of a generic competitor who was kept out of the market by virtue of the operation of the\nRegulations\n. That liability, on the facts of this case, was triggered by the Supreme Court of Canada's dismissal of Merck's application and its reversal of the prohibition order. That event did not take place until after the 1998\nRegulations\ncame into effect. Apotex's s. 8 claim could not been initiated until after the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in July 1998 and the remedies provision of the 1998\nRegulations\n, quite naturally, applied to it. Whether the 1993\nRegulations\nwould have given Apotex any relief is unknown, but there is nothing peculiar or unfair about Apotex initiating its action on the basis of the remedies provision then in force.\n\n[30]\nOne could say that, in this case, the 1998\nRegulations\ngovern events that straddle the date of its coming into force. Section 8 defines the scope of a patent holder's liability according to two dates - first, the date when the second company would have obtained its NOC but for the operation of the\nRegulations\nand, second, the date when the patent holder's prohibition order was overturned on appeal (or when its application was withdrawn or dismissed). In this case, the first date precedes the coming into force of the\nRegulations\n; the second date follows it. Justice Lebel described this situation as follows:\n\"New legislation does not operate retroactively when it is applied to a situation made up of a series of events that occurred before and after it came into force or with respect to legal effects straddling the date it came into force. If events are under way when it comes into force, the new legislation will apply in accordance with the principle of immediate application, that is, it governs the future development of the legal situation. If the legal effects of the situation are already occurring when the new legislation comes into force, the principle of retrospective effect applies. According to this principle, the new legislation governs the future consequences of events that happened before it came into force but does not modify effects that occurred before that date.\" (\nÉpiciers  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 46).\n\n[31]\nEven on this characterization of the\nRegulations\n, I cannot see any interference with any vested rights Merck might have held. Therefore, to the extent the\nRegulations\ncan be described as retrospective, I see no basis for Merck's argument that they run afoul of the general rule that subordinate legislation cannot operate retrospectively unless the enabling legislation clearly authorizes it.\n\n[32]\nIn conclusion, I find that the 1998\nRegulations\napply in this case. Merck is therefore liable to Apotex for \"any loss suffered during the period\" from the date Apotex would otherwise have obtained an NOC until the date Merck's application was dismissed. I come now to the second issue:\n2.\nIf Merck had not sought an order prohibiting Apotex from obtaining a NOC, would Apotex have been able to get onto the market and, if so, when?\n(a) Burden of Proof\n\n[33]\nIn essence, I must decide if Apotex did, in fact, suffer a loss by having been kept out of the market by virtue of the prohibition proceedings Merck had initiated. This requires me to consider what would have happened if Merck had not done so.\n\n[34]\nApotex argues that it does not have to prove on a balance of probabilities that, but for the operation of the\nRegulations\n, it would have entered the norfloxacin market. Rather, it need only show that it had a reasonable chance of doing so. The cases relied on by Apotex for this proposition deal with the calculation of damages where courts must consider the likelihood of future contingencies that might affect quantum (e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 243; 132 W.A.C. 243;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). But here we are considering Merck's liability for damages, not the quantification of those damages. At this stage, in my view, Apotex must show on a balance of probabilities that it was prevented from getting into the norfloxacin market because of Merck's prohibition application. As Justice Norris said in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Apotex must \"establish on the balance of probabilities that the chance of making a profit was real and not fanciful\" (para. 5(e)). This is consistent with the approach taken by Justice Johanne Gauthier in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 762. In the circumstances, Apotex must show, at a minimum, that it had access to a supply of norfloxacin. Without that, its assertion that it was kept out of the market by Merck's prohibition application would be fanciful, not real.\n\n[35]\nSection 8 provides relief within a defined period, beginning on the date the Minister would have issued an NOC to the generic manufacturer (unless some other date is more appropriate) and ending on the date the prohibition order was overturned. In this case, the relevant time frame is between June 10, 1993 and July 9, 1998. There is no basis in law for choosing a more appropriate beginning date, although that is not to say that Apotex, as a matter of fact, started suffering a loss on June 10, 1993.\n\n[36]\nAs mentioned above, this phase of the trial is confined to determining whether Apotex has shown a basis in fact and law for its claim. Above, I found that s. 8 of the 1998 Regulations provides a basis in law for Apotex's claim. Now, I must decide whether Apotex has proved a factual basis for it - that is, whether it would actually have been able to enter the norfloxacin market before 1998 and, if so, when.\n\n[37]\nIn summary, Merck argues that Apotex has failed to meet that burden because Apotex has not proved that it had an available supply of non-infringing material that would have permitted it to get product on the market.\n(c) Factors Affecting Market Entry\n\n[38]\nI need only consider whether Apotex could have entered the market with material obtained from Novopharm under Novopharm's compulsory license with Merck. The other possible route, through use of norfloxacin manufactured by a non-infringing process, was foreclosed by the decisions of Justice Rothstein and the Federal Court of Appeal, where it was found that the process proposed by Apotex actually did infringe the patent. It was also held up, as a matter of fact, by the difficulties that Apotex's supplier, Delmar Chemicals Inc., encountered in producing norfloxacin by an allegedly non-infringing process without impurities.\n\n[39]\nApotex's alternative was to use material obtained through Novopharm. Novopharm had a compulsory license from Merck for norfloxacin and had a reciprocal agreement with Apotex to supply licensed material on request. The Federal Court of Appeal concluded that this supply agreement amounted to an improper sublicense but the Supreme Court of Canada found otherwise in its decision of July 9, 1998. Therefore, the supply agreement created a means by which Apotex could, at least in theory, enter the norfloxacin market without infringing Merck's patent rights.\n\n[40]\nIn my view, however, Apotex was not in a position to enter the norfloxacin market in June 1993 even if there had been no prohibition application by Merck. There are two main reasons for this:\n1. Apotex did not have a willing supplier.\n2. Apotex did not have a willing partner in Novopharm, notwithstanding their mutual supply agreement.\n\n[41]\nOn the other hand, as discussed below, Apotex probably would have been able to enter the market by July 1996, when it could have asked Novopharm to obtain raw material from a foreign source, as it did in 1998, after Apotex received its NOC. The question, then, is whether Apotex could have entered the market prior to July 1996, notwithstanding its difficulties getting cooperation from its intended supplier, Delmar, and putative partner, Novopharm.\n(d) Problems with Supply\n\n[42]\nApotex submits that in 1993 it had a supplier who was ready and willing to provide Apotex with norfloxacin. Apotex was a minority shareholder in Delmar Chemicals Inc. and, accordingly, Apotex was entitled to request Delmar to provide it with material so long as doing so would not strain Delmar's capacity. However, Delmar was clearly uncomfortable with the arrangements Apotex was proposing.\n\n[43]\nApotex purported to order norfloxacin directly from Delmar on Novopharm's behalf. Delmar raised concerns about Apotex's proposal and, in 1995, sought a legal opinion about it. Thereafter, it agreed to supply norfloxacin only if it obtained indemnification from Apotex and Novopharm, and received a direct request from Novopharm. Apotex provided an indemnity, but not until October 27, 1997. Delmar never did receive an order from Novopharm or any indemnity from it.\n\n[44]\nClearly, Delmar would not have been ready, in June 1993, to start providing Apotex with norfloxacin by way of Apotex's supply agreement with Novopharm. At a minimum, even if Apotex had its NOC in hand, it would have taken several months to arrive at an arrangement that would have been satisfactory to Delmar.\n(e) Problems with Novopharm\n\n[45]\nSince October 15, 1991, Novopharm had a compulsory license from Merck in respect of norfloxacin. The licence entitled Novopharm to make, use or sell norfloxacin as of July 2, 1993, and to import it after July 2, 1996. Novopharm entered into a supply agreement with Apotex on November 27, 1992. Under the agreement, Novopharm and Apotex each agreed to supply the other with pharmaceutical ingredients if one of them had a license and the other did not. In this case, since Novopharm had a license for norfloxacin, Apotex was entitled, it argues, to ask Novopharm to supply norfloxacin to Apotex  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's request.\n\n[46]\nHowever, it took Apotex some time actually to convince Novopharm to go along with the arrangement. In April 1993, Apotex advised Novopharm that it intended to rely on their supply agreement to obtain norfloxacin. Details about quantities were left to a later date. Novopharm replied by asking Apotex to confirm whether Novopharm's license remained valid and there were no other patents of concern, and to address an outstanding grievance between Novopharm and Apotex about another drug (enalapril). Apotex reminded Novopharm about the terms of their mutual supply agreement, and undertook to indemnify Novopharm for any liability it might incur in responding to Apotex's request (which was part of the supply agreement anyway). Novopharm responded by stating that its license was no longer valid and, therefore, could not be relied on by Apotex under the supply agreement. Further, it pointed out that Eli Lilly was challenging the legality of the supply agreement and that Novopharm expected Apotex to reimburse Novopharm for the legal costs of defending it.\n\n[47]\nThe correspondence between Apotex and Novopharm continued, to and fro, for many months, indeed years. It was not until November 16, 1995 that Apotex made a formal request to Novopharm to supply it with norfloxacin. In particular, Apotex asked Novopharm to arrange for the manufacture of 2,000 kilograms of norfloxacin at Delmar. Novopharm refused. It said that the supply agreement had been terminated and that Apotex's proposal to deal directly with Delmar rendered Novopharm's license invalid. This position was backed up by Novopharm's lawyers.\n\n[48]\nThings remained quiet until 1998, until after the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its decision finding the supply agreement between Apotex and Novopharm was not an invalid sublicense and, accordingly, dismissing Merck's application for an order of prohibition. The Supreme Court of Canada issued its decision on July 9, 1998. Apotex received its NOC a week later. It then demanded material from Novopharm pursuant to the supply agreement. Within weeks, Novopharm issued purchase orders for the requested material. On August 18, 1998, Apotex received its first material from Novopharm, who had obtained the material from Cipla, a foreign source. More foreign material arrived in September. Apotex entered the market with its first sales in September 1998. Apotex received more foreign material throughout the autumn and winter of 1998-1999.\n\n[49]\nNovopharm was not what one could call a willing partner. While it did supply material  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's request, its compliance was no doubt a product in part of legal proceedings underway between the parties. Those proceedings led to a decision of Justice Ferrier in the Ontario Court (General Division) in January 1999, in which he upheld the supply agreement (in relation to another drug, nizatidine. See Court File No. 98-CV-157772, January 28, 1999).\n\n[50]\nBased on these events, Apotex suggests that certainly as of July 2, 1996, when it would have been permitted to obtain material through foreign sources, through the combination of Novopharm's license and the supply agreement between Novopharm and Apotex, without infringing Merck's patent rights, it was in a position to enter the market within weeks. Foreign sources were available during the relevant time frame.\n\n[51]\nAs for domestic sources, Apotex maintains that Novopharm would have obtained material from Delmar on Apotex's request. As discussed above, Delmar would have required a direct request from Novopharm and indemnity from Novopharm against any potential patent liability. Apotex suggests that those conditions would have been met by Novopharm because they were covered by the supply agreement between Apotex and Novopharm. In turn, Novopharm would have been indemnified by Apotex. Delmar was in a position to supply norfloxacin; the raw materials were readily available in 1993. So, Delmar-produced norfloxacin could have been put on the market by Apotex soon after Apotex received its NOC, had the Minister issued it in June 1993.\n\n[52]\nMerck notes, however, that Apotex made no request of Novopharm in respect of norfloxacin until November 16, 1995. Dr. Barry Sherman for Apotex purported to direct Novopharm to arrange for the manufacture of 2000 kilograms of norfloxacin at Delmar. In fact, the draft letter he attached stated that Novopharm wished to manufacture norfloxacin at Delmar's facilities. Merck notes that Novopharm's licence was for manufacture of norfloxacin, not purchase from another manufacturer. Therefore, it was important for the parties to make arrangements that would respect the licence. The license included many terms but did not expressly include the right to have norfloxacin made by another manufacturer and sold to others. In my view, however, Novopharm's license was broad enough to permit manufacture of norfloxacin by an agent of Novopharm and sold to Apotex to make a medicine. As mentioned, Novopharm raised numerous objections to the arrangements Apotex was proposing, but none of them related to any limitations on its license.\n\n[53]\nMerck also argues that Apotex's NOA did not match its new drug submission (NDS). It suggests that Apotex would not have managed to have its norfloxacin approved in 1993, notwithstanding the Minister's letter to the contrary. In its original NDS in 1990, Apotex named Chemo Iberica as the supplier of its active ingredient. It amended the NDS in 1992 to substitute Torcan Chemical Ltd. as the source. As mentioned, the Torcan process was a more complicated four-step process compared to the patented two-step process. Nevertheless, the Torcan process was found to be an obvious variation and an infringement of Merck's patent (by Justice Rothstein, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 144 F.T.R. 299 (T.D.)) upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal,\nApotex Inc\n. v.\nMerck Frosst Canada Inc\n., [1999] F.C.J. No. 206; 236 N.R. 179 (F.C.A.)). So Apotex could not obtain an NOC for norfloxacin by the Torcan process.\n\n[54]\nMerck further submits that Apotex could not have obtained an NOC for norfloxacin made by Novopharm at Delmar using the patented process because its NDS referred to a different process. The Drug Master File (DMF) would have had to be amended, as well as the NDS, before an NOC could issue. Either way, Merck argues, Apotex could not obtain an NOC at any time prior to July 9, 1998. I am not persuaded by Merck's submissions on this point. Apotex could have made changes in source and process of manufacture relatively easily, either by informal means, particularly prior to 1994. Thereafter, Apotex would have had to advise Health Canada of a notifiable change. Substituting Delmar as the supplier would have been easily done as Delmar was already an approved manufacturer.\n\n[55]\nFinally, Merck argues that Apotex's statement of claim only alleges that Delmar would have allowed Novopharm actually to manufacture norfloxacin at its plant, and makes no reference to the possibility of Apotex having access to foreign material. Paragraph 23 of the statement of claim states that Delmar was ready \"to enter an arrangement with Novopharm to manufacture norfloxacin at its plant\". Delmar clearly would not have allowed Novopharm employees to enter its plant and start making a drug. However, it would have permitted an arrangement whereby Novopharm could oversee production at Delmar. In my view, this potential arrangement is contemplated by paragraph 23.\n\n[56]\nAs for foreign sources, paragraph 22 of the statement of claim mentions Novopharm's license which permitted it to manufacture norfloxacin as of July 2, 1993 and to import it as of July 2, 1996. In my view, this allegation permitted Apotex to lead evidence about foreign sources. However, as discussed above, Apotex would have had access to domestic material from Delmar in any case through the supply agreement with Novopharm. It was not dependent on foreign material.\n\n[57]\nThe problems Apotex would likely have had getting Novopharm's cooperation would have slowed, not stopped, Apotex from getting on the market. As with the supply problems with Delmar, I am satisfied it would have taken Apotex up to a year to establish an arrangement with Novopharm. Litigation might well have been necessary.\nIII. Conclusion and Disposition\n\n[58]\nIn my view, therefore, Apotex has met its burden of proving that it would have entered the norfloxacin market before July 9, 1998 but for the operation of the\nRegulations\n. However, taking account of the problems with supply from Delmar, and with the supply agreement with Novopharm, I conclude that Apotex would not have been able to get on the market until one full year after it would have received its NOC, that is, as of June 10, 1994. Therefore, Apotex is entitled to be compensated for the losses it suffered between that date and July 9, 1998. I will allow Apotex's action against Merck under s. 8 of the\nRegulations\n, with costs. Determination of the quantum of damages will be made in the next phase of this trial.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[59]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT IS that:\n1.

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court determined that the 1998 version of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations applied to Apotex’s claim, rather than the 1993 version, because Apotex’s application for a Notice of Compliance was still 'pending' when the 1998 Regulations came into force. The court interpreted 'pending' to mean not yet finalized, even though a lower court had issued a prohibition order, as the matter was still subject to appeal.",
      "The court found the transitional rule in the 1998 Regulations (s. 9(6)) applied because the Supreme Court of Canada hadn’t rendered a final decision on the merits of Merck’s application until after the new Regulations took effect. This meant the amended remedies section (s. 8) of the 1998 Regulations, which provided for compensation for delays caused by prohibition orders later overturned, was applicable.",
      "The court rejected Merck’s argument that applying the 1998 Regulations would be retrospective, finding that the Regulations governed the future consequences of an ongoing situation (the appeal) rather than altering past events. It also dismissed concerns about interfering with vested rights, stating Merck only had an uncertain argument under the 1993 Regulations, not a guaranteed outcome.",
      "The court clarified that a matter is 'pending' as long as further steps can be taken, citing case law supporting the idea that a proceeding remains pending until all avenues of appeal are exhausted. The court distinguished this from a final decision at the Federal Court level, which would trigger different appeal rights.",
      "The court found Apotex was prevented from entering the market due to Merck’s prohibition application, but determined Apotex would not have been able to enter the market until one year after receiving a NOC (June 10, 1994) due to difficulties with both its supplier, Delmar, and its potential partner, Novopharm. This established the relevant period for calculating damages.",
      "The court determined that Apotex had a reasonable prospect of entering the market, even with the difficulties, and that the prohibition order was a causative factor in delaying that entry. The court found that Novopharm’s eventual cooperation after the Supreme Court decision demonstrated a potential pathway to market entry had the prohibition not been in place."
