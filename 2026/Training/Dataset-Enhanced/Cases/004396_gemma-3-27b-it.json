      "The court held that the applicant’s subjective reasons for not seeking state protection – shame, emotional dependence, and societal stigma – were insufficient to establish that state protection was not available or effective. The fact that she never sought any state protection, even with her mother’s support, was central to this finding.",
      "The court applied a standard of review of ‘patent unreasonableness’ to the RPD’s assessment of state protection. It found the RPD’s consideration of Korean state structures and reports regarding their implementation (specifically, U.S. DOS reports acknowledging some problems) was reasonable and balanced.",
      "The court rejected the argument that the RPD needed to conduct a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of Korean state protection. It reasoned that such a review was not required in the absence of substantial evidence demonstrating ineffectiveness, and there was no evidence suggesting the system was merely a ‘sham’ or ‘form over substance’."
