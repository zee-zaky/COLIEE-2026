    "[1]\nCollier, J. [orally]\n: I gave reasons for judgment in this action on March 9, 1987. [See 9 F.T.R. 241]. I requested counsel for the plaintiff to draw the formal pronouncement and submit it to counsel for the defendant; if the parties were unable to agree, I said I would settle the formal judgment.",
    "[2]\nThe parties have not been able to agree on some matters. The plaintiff brought a motion, in effect, to settle the judgment. There were several points discussed. I clarified one preliminary point.",
    "[3]\nIn preparing for this motion to settle, I reread my reasons for judgment. I noticed two obvious errors, on my part, in the second full paragraph on page 22. I referred to \"the plaintiff's contention,\" and later \"the plaintiff had submitted\". In fact, it had been the contention of the defendant, and the submission of the defendant. I had, late last week, directed two changes be made so that \"defendant's\" and \"defendant\" were to be substituted. [These corrections are reflected in the reasons reported 9 F.T.R. 241, p. 248].",
    "[4]\nThere was a question raised as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction in respect of patent 864,875. (The other patent, 805,757, expired on February 11, 1986).",
    "[5]\nIt is true, I did not specifically say, in my reasons, the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction. But I found validity, and infringement. I dismissed the defences of lateness and acquiescence. Having made those findings, I intended the plaintiff to have the relief requested in the prayer for relief, where applicable.",
    "[6]\nI do not think it necessary, in reasons for judgment, to set out precisely the relief to be granted to the plaintiff. That is more properly to be found in the pronouncement (formal judgment).",
    "[7]\nThe same remarks apply to the discussion as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to delivery up of the offending devices.",
    "[8]\nIn respect of delivery up and patent 864,875, there is a claim, or claims, involving a combination of a wheelchair having a footrest with the latch device specified in the patent. I direct there be delivery up of wheelchairs, as well as separate wheelchair parts, which offend.",
    "[9]\nIn respect of patent 805,957, and delivery up, I direct that there be delivery up of wheelchairs or parts manufactured prior to February 11, 1986, that offend the claims. If the offending parts can be separated from the wheelchair, then only those parts need be delivered up.",
    "[10]\nThe plaintiff sought to amend the statement of claim to request prejudgment and postjudgment interest.",
    "[11]\nI am not convinced any amendment is needed in respect of postjudgment interest. This Court can, pursuant to s. 40 of the Federal Court Act, fix a rate of interest greater, or perhaps even less, than that set out in the Interest Act. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  postjudgment interest, I direct that it shall run from March 9, 1987, the date of my reasons. The per annum rate will be the average of the Bank of Canada rate in succeeding months or years or five per cent, whichever is higher, until the date of satisfaction of the judgment.",
    "[12] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[13]\nIn respect of a claim for prejudgment interest, it is my view, it should be requested in the statement of claim, or at the very latest, at some stage during the trial where the defendant can consider the matter, challenge the jurisdiction of this Court to award that kind of interest, or challenge the rates claimed.",
    "[14]\nPreferably, the claim for prejudgment interest should be set out in the statement of claim; setting out precisely what law is said to apply. The defendant then knows fully the case he has to meet. For example, in a claim for a liquidated amount, the defendant can then consider settlement, or a payment into court, and what monetary risks there are if the action proceeds to trial.",
    "[15]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Federal Court of Appeal), the trial judge had allowed prejudgment interest, apparently applying the relevant Ontario legislation. The Federal Court of Appeal confirmed the awarding of prejudgment interest, in the somewhat unusual circumstances of that case, and of that appeal.",
    "[16]\nHere, the facts are dissimilar. The request for prejudgment interest is requested after the hearing and argument, and after reasons have issued.",
    "[17]\nIt would be, as I see it, unfair, and unjust, to allow the amendment at this stage, or to entertain the request today.",
    "[18]\nRe the witness Knaub. I ruled he was qualified to give expert evidence. In my view, he is entitled to be paid (pursuant to section 4(2) of Tariff A., reasonable payment for the services performed by him in preparing to give evidence and in giving evidence.",
    "[19]\nI am not prepared to direct that the taxing officer be given power to increase the scale of counsel fees. There was nothing exceptional in this case. I refer to the C.A.E. reasons, earlier cited, and the cases referred to in those reasons.",

      "The court initially issued reasons for judgment on March 9, 1987.",

        "Entitlement to an injunction regarding patent 864,875 (despite it not being explicitly stated in the reasons for judgment, it was intended as the findings of validity and infringement supported the request for relief).",

    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The court clarified two factual errors in its original reasons for judgment regarding attribution of contentions and submissions, correcting references to the 'plaintiff' to 'defendant' and updating the reported reasons accordingly.",
      "Despite not explicitly stating an injunction was granted, the court reasoned that its findings of patent validity and infringement, coupled with the dismissal of defenses, inherently intended the plaintiff to receive the relief requested in their prayer for relief, particularly regarding patent 864,875 (and for patent 805,757 prior to its expiration). The court clarified that specific relief details are more appropriately addressed in the formal judgment pronouncement.",
      "The court ordered delivery up of infringing wheelchairs and parts, differentiating between those related to patent 864,875 and those related to the expired patent 805,757, limiting delivery up for the latter to items manufactured before its expiration date. This was based on the established findings of infringement.",
      "The court allowed the amendment to claim post-judgment interest, citing its authority under Section 40 of the Federal Court Act to set interest rates independently of the Interest Act, and set the rate to the higher of the Bank of Canada rate or 5% from the date of the original judgment (March 9, 1987).",
      "The court denied the amendment to claim pre-judgment interest, finding it procedurally inappropriate as the request was made after the hearing and issuance of reasons. The court emphasized that pre-judgment interest claims should be included in the statement of claim or raised during trial to allow the defendant a fair opportunity to respond, citing a Federal Court of Appeal case where the circumstances were significantly different.",
      "The court affirmed the expert witness Knaub’s qualification and ordered reasonable payment for his services under Tariff A, section 4(2).",
      "The court declined to authorize an increase in counsel fees, finding no exceptional circumstances warranting such an adjustment, referencing prior case law (C.A.E. reasons) for support."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "Application to amend statement of claim for prejudgment interest was denied.",
      "Postjudgment interest shall run from March 9, 1987, at the average of the Bank of Canada rate in succeeding months or years or five per cent, whichever is higher, until satisfaction of the judgment.",
      "Delivery up of wheelchairs and separate wheelchair parts infringing patent 864,875 is ordered.",
      "Delivery up of wheelchairs or parts manufactured prior to February 11, 1986, infringing patent 805,957 is ordered.",
