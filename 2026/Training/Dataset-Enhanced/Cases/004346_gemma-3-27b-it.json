    "[0]\n..................................................\nI.\nOverview",
    "[1]\nGascon, J.\n: Mr. Suleiman entered Canada in July 2004 and became a permanent resident on that day. He applied for Canadian citizenship on April 1, 2009. As the citizenship officer reviewing his application was not satisfied that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirements during the relevant period of reference, Mr. Suleiman completed a residency questionnaire. In April 2014, after reviewing Mr. Suleiman's application, his residency questionnaire and other documents, the citizenship officer identified some concerns with Mr. Suleiman's file and with the credibility of his statements about his presence in Canada.",
    "[2]\nThe matter was thus referred to a citizenship judge who held a two and a half hour hearing with Mr. Suleiman in October 2014, where he questioned him and discussed the issues of concern regarding the number of days he resided in Canada. The citizenship judge concluded that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirements and, on October 20, 2014, he approved Mr. Suleiman's application for citizenship.",
    "[3]\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has applied for a judicial review of this decision of the citizenship judge on the basis that the judge made numerous erroneous factual findings and did not show a grasp of the concerns raised by the citizenship officer. The Minister also contends that the citizenship judge's reasons in support of his decision were inadequate and insufficient. In response, Mr. Suleiman submits that the citizenship judge's decision was reasonable, and that the factual errors identified by the Minister were immaterial to the decision. Mr. Suleiman is also seeking costs from the Minister.",
    "[4]\nThe outcome of this application for judicial review turns on the credibility assessments made by the citizenship judge on Mr. Suleiman's residence in Canada and on the sufficiency of his reasons. For the reasons that follow, the Minister's application for judicial review is dismissed. I am not convinced that the citizenship judge's decision is unreasonable or that the discrepancies singled out by the Minister were material to the judge's decision. I also find that the reasons for the decision adequately explain how the citizenship judge found that Mr. Suleiman had met the residency requirement. However, I agree with the Minister that there are no special reasons justifying an award of costs to Mr. Suleiman in this matter.\nII.\nBackground",
    "[5]\nIn his decision dated October 20, 2014, the citizenship judge found, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, RSC 1985 c 29 to obtain Canadian citizenship, as outlined in\nRe Pourghasemi\n(1993), 62 FTR 122, 19 Imm LR (2d) 259 (FCTD). This physical test of residence provides that the Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who, within the relevant four-year or 1460-day period of reference, has accumulated at least three years (or 1095 days) of residence in Canada.",
    "[6]\nThe citizenship judge identified the period of reference as being from April 1, 2005 to April 1, 2009, and noted that Mr. Suleiman had declared 1402 days of presence in Canada and 58 days of absence from Canada in that time frame.",
    "[7]\nAfter summarizing the procedural steps leading to his decision, including his review of the residency questionnaire and documents submitted by Mr. Suleiman and Mr. Suleiman's appearance at a hearing before him, the citizenship judge outlined the facts as he understood them. Specifically, the citizenship judge mentioned the following:\nMr. Suleiman's work experience of 20 years in Dubai with Ernst and Young and the termination of his employment there at the beginning of 2005;\nMr. Suleiman's arrival in Canada with his family in July 2004 and his trip back to Dubai approximately three months later to finalize his affairs in Dubai;\nMr. Suleiman's return to Canada in March 2005;\nThe fact that Mr. Suleiman left Canada only twice since March 2005 for short visits to Dubai to see his family;\nMr. Suleiman's residence with his cousin for about 7 months when he returned to Canada in 2005, and then in the apartment that his brother owned after his wife and children moved out of it, until 2010;\nMr. Suleiman's contentious divorce proceedings, finally disposed of in 2011.",
    "[8]\nThe citizenship judge then referred to the credibility concerns raised by the citizenship officer with regard to Mr. Suleiman's file, and cited:\nInconsistencies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the evidence from the court decision in his divorce proceedings regarding the termination of his employment in Dubai;\nThe absence of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport;\nA United Arab Emirates [UAE] stamp dated \"25 May 2005\", a date not declared by Mr. Suleiman;\nA UAE residence visa in Mr. Suleiman's passport for the entire period of reference;\nThe absence or scarcity of financial documents for 2005 and 2006;\nAn absence of evidence of mortgage, rent or utility payments during the period of reference.",
    "[9]\nThe citizenship judge reviewed each of the citizenship officer's concerns about Mr. Suleiman's file and discussed them in the decision. Specifically, the citizenship judge concluded that it was difficult to determine the extent of inconsistencies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the court decision on his divorce because the remarks in the divorce court order regarding Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai were \"very vague\".",
    "[10]\nThe citizenship judge found that the lack of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport could not lead to any conclusions as the Canadian Border Services Agency at Pearson Airport routinely did not stamp permanent residents' passports returning to Canada during that time period.",
    "[11]\nFurther to his examination of Mr. Suleiman's passport, the citizenship judge concluded that a \"May 25, 2006\" (not 2005) stamp was clearly visible, a date corresponding with an absence from Canada declared by Mr. Suleiman.",
    "[12]\nIn addressing the citizenship officer's concern that Mr. Suleiman's passport contained a UAE residence visa during the period of reference, the citizenship judge found that the visa did not cover the entire period, and noted that visas are routinely not cancelled when a person leaves Dubai while the visa is valid.",
    "[13]\nThe citizenship judge acknowledged the citizenship officer's concern regarding the lack of financial documents for 2005, the paucity of those for 2006 and the dearth of evidence regarding rent/mortgage or utility payments; however, he accepted Mr. Suleiman's explanation that he did not work in 2005, and that his income was small in 2006 as he only started working when his financial resources were depleted. The citizenship judge also noted Mr. Suleiman's explanation that his ex-wife had kept and destroyed most of his documents, and that he had not disclosed his divorce on his residency questionnaire because he was ashamed and the divorce had not been finalized until 2011.",
    "[14]\nThe citizenship judge found the documentation and explanations from Mr. Suleiman credible as they substantiated his claim that he resided in Canada during the time he had declared residence in the country. The citizenship judge further noted the absence of evidence that Mr. Suleiman had travelled outside Canada other than for his declared absences.",
    "[15]\nThe citizenship judge concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Suleiman had demonstrated that he had resided in Canada for a sufficient number of days to meet the residency requirement of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the\nCitizenship Act\n.\nIII.\nAnalysis\nA.\nWere the conclusions of the citizenship judge on Mr. Suleiman's residence in Canada unreasonable?",
    "[16]\nThe Minister alleges that the citizenship judge made a number of incorrect factual findings in his decision, sufficient to render his decision unreasonable. Mr. Suleiman replies that the citizenship judge had the opportunity to assess his credibility during a hearing which lasted over two and a half hours, and that the Minister has not produced a transcript of such hearing. In his decision, the citizenship judge found the explanations of Mr. Suleiman credible. Counsel for Mr. Suleiman acknowledged that there could be minor discrepancies between Mr. Suleiman's application and the residency questionnaire but contends that these have no material impact on the physical test of residence used by the citizenship judge, given that Mr. Suleiman exceeded the residence requirement by a significant margin of about 300 days.",
    "[17]\nI agree with Mr. Suleiman and am satisfied that the citizenship judge's findings were reasonable and that the minor discrepancies identified by the Minister were not material enough to render the decision unreasonable. The judge engaged in a thorough and detailed assessment of the evidence on Mr. Suleiman's presence in Canada. While the citizenship judge could perhaps have provided additional reasons to support certain findings, there is no fatal flaw to his reasoning and I am satisfied that he considered the totality of the evidence.",
    "[18]\nIt is well established that the standard of reasonableness applies to a review of a citizenship judge's decision in determining whether the residency requirement has been met (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[19]\nWhen reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis is concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. Findings involving questions of facts or mixed fact and law should not be disturbed provided that the decision \"falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In conducting a reasonableness review of factual findings, it is not the role of the Court to reweigh the evidence or the relative importance given by the immigration officer to any relevant factor ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Under a reasonableness standard, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency, and intelligibility, a reviewing court should not substitute its own view of a preferable outcome (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSafi\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[20]\nIt is also settled law that the courts owe significant deference to credibility findings made by boards and tribunals (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 4;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In particular, the credibility findings of citizenship judges deserve such deference because they are better situated to \"make the factual determination as to whether the threshold question of the existence of a residence has been established\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[21]\nThe Minister contends that the citizenship judge made several incorrect factual findings with respect to passport issues, discrepancies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the evidence in the divorce court order, and Mr. Suleiman's travels outside of Canada in 2004 and 2005.",
    "[22]\nThe Minister's arguments on these factual findings invite the Court to substitute its view of the evidence for that of the citizenship judge. The judge heard from Mr. Suleiman directly at the hearing and thoroughly reviewed the evidence before reaching the conclusion that Mr. Suleiman had resided the sufficient number of days in Canada in the period of reference. The Minister has not pointed to evidence that contradicts this finding. There is also no basis for an inference that the citizenship judge ignored material evidence that squarely contradicted his conclusions (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 3). A failure to mention an element of evidence does not mean that it was ignored or that there was a reviewable error. In this case, the judge has also had the benefit of a long hearing with Mr. Suleiman, for which there is no transcript to contradict the evidence on the record or the affidavit filed by Mr. Suleiman. The decision of the citizenship judge evidently took into account the oral evidence provided by Mr. Suleiman. A review of the decision shows that the judge found the following:\nMr. Suleiman terminated his employment in Dubai at the beginning of 2005 and returned to Canada in March 2005, after finalizing his affairs in Dubai;\nMr. Suleiman left Canada only twice since March 2005 for short visits to Dubai to see his family;\nMr. Suleiman had places of residence in Canada when he returned to Canada in 2005 and throughout the period of reference, first with his cousin and afterwards in an apartment owned by his brother;\nMr. Suleiman had not travelled outside of Canada other than for his declared absences;\nThere were satisfactory explanations for the absence of Canadian re-entry stamps on Mr. Suleiman's passport, the alleged \"25 May 2005\" stamp date and the UAE residence visa in Mr. Suleiman's passport.",
    "[23]\nA decision-maker such as a citizenship judge is deemed to have considered all the evidence in the file [\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CAF), in paragraph 3]. Failure to mention evidence does not mean that it was not considered or that a reviewable error was made. In this case, the judge also had the opportunity to hold a lengthy hearing with Mr. Suleiman, for which there is no transcript contradicting the evidence in the record or the affidavit filed by Mr. Suleiman. In his decision, the citizenship judge obviously took into consideration the oral testimony provided by Mr. Suleiman. A review of the decision reveals that the judge concluded the following:\nMr. Suleiman left his job in Dubai in early 2005 and returned to Canada in March 2005, after settling his affairs in Dubai;\nMr. Suleiman has only left Canada twice since March 2005 for short trips to Dubai to see his family;\nMr. Suleiman had places of residence in Canada when he returned to the country in 2005 and throughout the reference period, first with his cousin and then in an apartment belonging to his brother;\nMr. Suleiman had not traveled outside of Canada for purposes other than his declared absences;\nThere have been satisfactory explanations regarding the absence of Canadian entry stamps on Mr. Suleiman's passport, the purported stamp date of May 25, 2005, and the UAE residency visa in Mr. Suleiman's passport.",
    "[24]\nIn view of these elements, it was reasonable for the citizenship judge to conclude that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement. I further note that this is not a situation where Mr. Suleiman was close to the minimum number of days required to meet the physical test of residence; even with some minor discrepancies in the evidence relating to some travel dates, he was well above the 1095 day threshold.",
    "[25]\nI now turn to the more specific allegations made by the Minister. The Minister challenges the citizenship judge's statement that the remarks made in the divorce proceedings regarding Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai were \"very vague\". The divorce court order reported that Mr. Suleiman had indicated a termination of his employment in Dubai sometime in 2005 or 2006; since Mr. Suleiman had responded in his residency questionnaire that his employment in Dubai rather ended prior to his entry in Canada in July 2004, the Minister contends that Mr. Suleiman either provided inaccurate information in his residency questionnaire or in the divorce court proceedings. I do not find that the judge's conclusion on Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai is unreasonable. In his decision, the citizenship judge reports that, based on the evidence before him, Mr. Suleiman returned to Canada in March 2005 and terminated his employment in Dubai in early 2005; this does not contradict the divorce court order. Mr. Suleiman also points out that, in his affidavit (which was not contradicted), the citizenship judge did in fact question him about this specific issue during the hearing, and was satisfied with his response.",
    "[26]\nWhile the judge could arguably have elaborated further on the apparent discrepancy with the residency questionnaire, it does not make his decision on this point unreasonable. His finding is rather supported by evidence on the record. Furthermore, I agree with Mr. Suleiman that this alleged discrepancy is in any event peripheral and immaterial to the decision given that the termination of his employment in Dubai was before the period of reference ranging from April 2005 to April 2009.",
    "[27]\nThe Minister is right to point out that there remains at all times a positive obligation on the citizenship applicants to provide true, correct, and complete information and to refrain from making false declarations. This however does not mean that corroborative evidence is required on every single element. It is well recognized that the\nCitizenship Act\ndoes not require corroboration on all counts; instead, it is \"the responsibility of the original decision-maker, taking the context into consideration, to determine the extent and nature of the evidence required\" (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nEl Bousserghini\n]). The citizenship judge may not have reconciled the apparent discrepancy as clearly as the Minister would have liked to see it in his reasons, or explained in as much detail as the Minister would have hoped how Mr. Suleiman convinced the judge that the discrepancy did not harm his credibility. But there is nothing to indicate that the judge's finding on Mr. Suleiman's return to Canada prior to the beginning of the reference period was not reasonable.",
    "[28]\nThe Minister also submits that the citizenship judge made a factual error on Mr. Suleiman's travel dates to Dubai from October to December 2004, and from December 2004 or January 2005 to March 2005. I again note that these trips occurred before the period of reference and have no impact on the calculations for the residence requirements. Given that the citizenship judge had the benefit of the hearing with Mr. Suleiman, I find that the citizenship judge was entitled not to draw an adverse credibility finding out of such evidence.",
    "[29]\nThe Minister further contends that the citizenship judge made a factual error by stating that Mr. Suleiman only left Canada twice since his return in March 2005, whereas his citizenship application and residency questionnaire indicate that he had actually left Canada three times. Assuming there is a discrepancy, the evidence shows that, in the worst-case scenario, the difference adds up to some 14 days of absence from Canada (73 days as opposed to 59) out of the 1460 days considered for the residency period. I agree with counsel for Mr. Suleiman that such a minor difference is of no relevance, considering that the citizenship judge also concluded that all the trips of Mr. Suleiman outside of Canada had been declared. Once again, it was therefore not unreasonable for the citizenship judge not to refer to this extensively in his decision.",
    "[30]\nThis is not a situation where, as in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the exercise of discretion by the citizenship judge went too far and the judge accepted weak and unconceivable explanations on unreported absences with no further inquiries (at paras 23 and 30). In the present case, the citizenship judge reviewed these concerns with Mr. Suleiman at the hearing and concluded that Mr. Suleiman had met his onus to establish residence through sufficient and credible evidence. All of the alleged errors or discrepancies identified by the Minister relate to factual findings made by the citizenship judge after he had the opportunity to question the credibility of Mr. Suleiman at the hearing and after he was satisfied about it. Furthermore, they are discrepancies regarding events that occurred outside of the period of reference, and would not have affected the outcome of the residency requirement. The minor factual errors identified by the Minister are far from making the decision unreasonable and are not significant enough to warrant this Court's intervention.",
    "[31]\nAs this Court stated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  immaterial errors, even if there are several, are not sufficient to render a decision unreasonable. An imperfect decision with immaterial errors remains reasonable.",
    "[32]\nThe Minister also takes issue with the manner in which the citizenship judge weighed Mr. Suleiman's declarations against the objective evidence, submitting that the citizenship judge did not hold Mr. Suleiman to his evidentiary onus under the\nCitizenship Act\n. The Minister contends that Mr. Suleiman did not provide objective corroborative evidence to establish his residence in Canada between April 2005 and June 2006, and that this was unreasonable given the discrepancies in the evidence. The Minister submits that the lack of Canadian re-entry stamps and documentary evidence establishing residency in Canada is important because the citizenship judge failed to assess whether, in absence of such corroborative evidence, Mr. Suleiman was able to meet his evidentiary onus.",
    "[33]\nI do not agree with this reading of the decision. I rather conclude that the decision reflects that the citizenship judge turned his mind to those issues and addressed them. He found that the absence of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport could not lead to any conclusions given the Canada Border Services Agency's practice of not stamping permanent residents' passports returning to Canada during that period. He also reviewed and considered the paucity of financial documents for 2005 and 2006 and the lack of evidence regarding rent/mortgage or utility payments made by Mr. Suleiman, and accepted Mr. Suleiman's explanation about his unemployment in 2005, the depletion of his financial resources in 2006 and the destruction of documents by his ex-wife in the context of his divorce. It was certainly not unreasonable, in light of such evidence, for the citizenship judge to conclude that Mr. Suleiman met his onus of demonstrating residence in Canada in the period of reference. The citizenship judge found the documentation and explanations provided by Mr. Suleiman credible as they substantiated his claim that he resided in Canada during the time he had declared residence in the country.",
    "[34]\nThe Court understands the Minister's desire to receive more detailed or more complete reasons from a citizenship judge, as the process established by the\nCitizenship Act\nrequires a citizenship officer to refer a matter to a citizenship judge when the officer has concerns and is not satisfied that residency requirements are met. But the test this Court has to apply is not whether the decision satisfies the expectations of the Minister; the test is the reasonableness of the decision. None of the conclusions of the citizenship judge are outside the range of reasonableness. Where there might have been some alleged inconsistencies, they were either immaterial or could be reasonably reconciled within the decision.",
    "[35]\nI find the ultimate result reasonable considering the totality of the evidence and the applicable legal principles. The decision falls within a range of reasonable alternatives defensible in respect of the facts and the law, and this Court should not interfere with it on judicial review.\nB.\nWere the reasons provided by the citizenship judge in support of his decision sufficient and adequate?",
    "[36]\nThe Minister submits that the citizenship judge's reasons are inadequate in that they do not show a grasp of the issues raised by the evidence, let alone the concerns raised by the citizenship officer for the citizenship judge's consideration. As such, they do not allow a reviewing party to understand why the citizenship judge made his decision. I do not agree and rather find that the citizenship judge's reasons were adequate.",
    "[37]\nThe law relating to the sufficiency of reasons in administrative decision-making has evolved substantially since <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , both with respect to the degree of scrutiny to which fact-based decisions such as the decision at issue in this case should be subjected, and in relation to the sufficiency of reasons as a stand-alone ground for judicial review. In\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [\nNewfoundland Nurses\n], the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance on how to approach situations where decision-makers provide brief or limited reasons. An alleged insufficiency of reasons is no longer a stand-alone basis for granting judicial review: reasons need not be fulsome or perfect, and need not address all of the evidence or arguments put forward by a party or in the record.",
    "[38]\nThe decision-maker is not required to refer to each and every detail supporting his or her conclusion. It is sufficient if the reasons permit the Court to understand why the decision was made and determine whether the conclusion falls within the range of possible acceptable outcomes (\nNewfoundland Nurses\nat para 16). The reasons are to be read as a whole, in conjunction with the record, in order to determine whether the reasons provide the justification, transparency and intelligibility required of a reasonable decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This Court discussed the issue of adequacy of reasons in a citizenship judge's decision in the recent\nSafi\ndecision. In that decision, Justice Kane echoed the\nNewfoundland Nurses\nprinciples and stated that the decision-maker is not required to set out every reason, argument or detail in the reasons, or to make an explicit finding on each element that leads to the final conclusion. The reasons are to \"be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes\" (\nSafi\nat para 17).",
    "[39]\nIn this case, the citizenship judge's decision meets this standard; the reasons clearly explain why he decided that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement and how he considered the evidence. Consequently, there is no merit to the argument that the judge's reasons were insufficient. The focus of judicial review remains on the outcome or decision itself, and not the process by which that outcome was reached. A reviewing court looks to the record with a view to upholding the decision; where readily apparent, evidentiary gaps may be filled in when supported by the evidence, and logical inferences implicit to the result may be drawn (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). That said, I acknowledge that\nNewfoundland Nurses\nis not an invitation to the Court to provide reasons that were not given, nor is it a licence to guess what findings might have been made or to speculate as to what a decision-maker might have been thinking. However, this is not the case here; rather, it is a situation where the reviewing court can connect the dots and draw the lines in the citizenship judge's decision.",
    "[40]\nIn this application for judicial review, it is the Minister's burden to persuade this Court that its intervention is warranted. However, it was Mr. Suleiman's duty to provide sufficient evidence that he met the residency requirement, and it was the citizenship judge's duty to provide reasons to show how he arrived at his decision (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is what the citizenship judge did.",
    "[41]\nReasonableness, not perfection, is the standard. In citizenship matters, reasons for decision are often very brief and do not always address all discrepancies in the evidence. However, even where the reasons for the decision are brief, or poorly written, this Court should defer to the decision-maker's weighing of the evidence and credibility determinations, as long as the Court is able to understand why the citizenship judge made its decision (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nThomas\n];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLee\n];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).",
    "[42]\nIn\nThomas\n, for example, the citizenship judge found that the respondent was credible, addressed the citizenship officer's concerns and accepted the respondent's explanations. In response to the Minister's argument that there was insufficient evidence, Justice Mosley noted that, although the notes could have been clearer and more thorough, the ultimate decision rested on a reasonable assessment of the evidence, including the explanations provided by the respondent. Justice Mosley pointed out that the case did not contain unexplained gaps in the evidence, as the respondent had provided explanations that the citizenship judge found credible. Justice Mosley reminded that the Court must defer to the decision-maker's weighing of the evidence and credibility determination in absence of clear error (\nThomas\nat paras 33-34).",
    "[43]\nCases where the Court agreed to intervene are distinguishable from the present one. In\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the citizenship officer had highlighted various concerns including a visa on a date where the applicant claimed to be in Canada, bank statements that were generally abundant but had periods of no activity when she was supposed to be in Canada, and doctor's visits on dates where she was supposed to be traveling. Justice Boivin found that the decision was not reasonable because these gaps in the evidence were not addressed, and the Court was unable to understand the citizenship judge's reasoning ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 28). In\nSafi\n, Justice Kane acknowledged that some of the unaddressed inadequacies were not important and likely the cause of a simple misunderstanding, but noted that there were problematic issues that required more careful scrutiny including illegible passport stamps, a failure to declare certain travel, and a visa issued in another name. Justice Kane found it was not clear how the citizenship judge weighed the evidence, and appeared to have ignored evidence which should have alerted him to probe further (\nSafi\nat paras 44-45).",
    "[44]\nIn\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration\n)\nv Jeizan\n, 2010 FC 323, Justice de Montigny found the extent of the short fall in days of residence to be much higher than what the citizenship judge had identified and the limited documentary proof to be problematic, particularly since numerous receipts provided to establish the applicant's presence in Canada were on dates she had admitted to not being present in the country. This Court has also quashed decisions of a citizenship judge to grant citizenship where it found the respondent had engaged in substantial misrepresentation (often involving substantial absences from Canada) that was not addressed by the citizenship judge's decision (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[45]\nThe present case is different. The citizenship judge identified the residency test he relied on and addressed the credibility concerns raised by the citizenship officer; there were no gaps in evidence or periods unaccounted for. I have no hesitation to conclude that the reasons are sufficient and adequate with regard to the test established by\nNewfoundland Nurses\n. It is clear from the decision why the citizenship judge approved Mr. Suleiman's application and dismissed the citizenship officer's concerns.\nC.\nAre there special reasons to award costs in this case?",
    "[46]\nMr. Suleiman asks for costs, given that the application for judicial review was ill-founded and there was an inordinate five-year delay before the citizenship judge adjudicated his citizenship application.",
    "[47]\nCosts are not ordinarily awarded in immigration proceedings in this Court, as Rule 22 of the\nFederal Courts\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22 provides that \"[n]o costs shall be awarded to or payable by any party in respect of an application for leave, an application for judicial review or an appeal under these Rules unless the Court, for special reasons, so orders.\" While each case turns on its own particular circumstances, the threshold for establishing the existence of \"special reasons\" is high (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In the circumstances of this case, I do not find that there are special reasons warranting an order of costs.",
    "[48]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Federal Court of Appeal provided a detailed summary of the circumstances in which the Court has recognized \"special circumstances\" meriting an award of costs. This decision observed that, based on an analysis of the jurisprudence, \"special reasons\" justifying an award of costs against the Minister have been found to exist where:\n- The Minister causes an applicant to suffer a significant waste of time and resources by taking inconsistent positions in the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal;\n- An immigration official circumvents an order of the Court;\n- An immigration official engages in conduct that is misleading or abusive;\n- An immigration official issues a decision only after an unreasonable and unjustified delay;\n- The Minister unreasonably opposes an obviously meritorious application for judicial review.",
    "[49]\nI do not find that the circumstances of this case are similar or close to those situations which have justified an order of costs. Special reasons do not arise merely because the Minister elected to exercise his statutory right to apply for judicial review of a decision and is not successful. Furthermore, I agree with the Minister that the five-year delay between Mr. Suleiman's application and the citizenship judge's decision does not amount to a sufficient reason for costs, as Mr. Suleiman could have sought the Court's assistance to deal with any prejudice he might have suffered during those five years, but elected not to do it.",
    "[50]\nI am therefore not persuaded that \"special reasons\" exist in this case that would justify an order of costs, and I decline to make such an order.\nIV.\nConclusion",
    "[51]\nFor the reasons set forth above, this application for judicial review is dismissed. Although the Minister might have preferred a more elaborate decision, the citizenship judge addressed all concerns that were raised by the citizenship officer in his decision and explained why they did not impact his finding on residence requirement. His decision was reasonable and provided adequate reasons. I do not find that there were unreasonable factual findings made by the citizenship judge or that the judge lacked a grasp of the issues raised by the citizenship officer. Instead, the citizenship judge addressed the concerns that were raised, first discussing them with Mr. Suleiman, and then explaining them in his decision.\nJUDGMENT",

  "full_text": "..................................................\nI.\nOverview\n[1]\nGascon, J.\n: Mr. Suleiman entered Canada in July 2004 and became a permanent resident on that day. He applied for Canadian citizenship on April 1, 2009. As the citizenship officer reviewing his application was not satisfied that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirements during the relevant period of reference, Mr. Suleiman completed a residency questionnaire. In April 2014, after reviewing Mr. Suleiman's application, his residency questionnaire and other documents, the citizenship officer identified some concerns with Mr. Suleiman's file and with the credibility of his statements about his presence in Canada.\n[2]\nThe matter was thus referred to a citizenship judge who held a two and a half hour hearing with Mr. Suleiman in October 2014, where he questioned him and discussed the issues of concern regarding the number of days he resided in Canada. The citizenship judge concluded that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirements and, on October 20, 2014, he approved Mr. Suleiman's application for citizenship.\n[3]\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has applied for a judicial review of this decision of the citizenship judge on the basis that the judge made numerous erroneous factual findings and did not show a grasp of the concerns raised by the citizenship officer. The Minister also contends that the citizenship judge's reasons in support of his decision were inadequate and insufficient. In response, Mr. Suleiman submits that the citizenship judge's decision was reasonable, and that the factual errors identified by the Minister were immaterial to the decision. Mr. Suleiman is also seeking costs from the Minister.\n[4]\nThe outcome of this application for judicial review turns on the credibility assessments made by the citizenship judge on Mr. Suleiman's residence in Canada and on the sufficiency of his reasons. For the reasons that follow, the Minister's application for judicial review is dismissed. I am not convinced that the citizenship judge's decision is unreasonable or that the discrepancies singled out by the Minister were material to the judge's decision. I also find that the reasons for the decision adequately explain how the citizenship judge found that Mr. Suleiman had met the residency requirement. However, I agree with the Minister that there are no special reasons justifying an award of costs to Mr. Suleiman in this matter.\nII.\nBackground\n[5]\nIn his decision dated October 20, 2014, the citizenship judge found, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, RSC 1985 c 29 to obtain Canadian citizenship, as outlined in\nRe Pourghasemi\n(1993), 62 FTR 122, 19 Imm LR (2d) 259 (FCTD). This physical test of residence provides that the Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who, within the relevant four-year or 1460-day period of reference, has accumulated at least three years (or 1095 days) of residence in Canada.\n[6]\nThe citizenship judge identified the period of reference as being from April 1, 2005 to April 1, 2009, and noted that Mr. Suleiman had declared 1402 days of presence in Canada and 58 days of absence from Canada in that time frame.\n[7]\nAfter summarizing the procedural steps leading to his decision, including his review of the residency questionnaire and documents submitted by Mr. Suleiman and Mr. Suleiman's appearance at a hearing before him, the citizenship judge outlined the facts as he understood them. Specifically, the citizenship judge mentioned the following:\nMr. Suleiman's work experience of 20 years in Dubai with Ernst and Young and the termination of his employment there at the beginning of 2005;\nMr. Suleiman's arrival in Canada with his family in July 2004 and his trip back to Dubai approximately three months later to finalize his affairs in Dubai;\nMr. Suleiman's return to Canada in March 2005;\nThe fact that Mr. Suleiman left Canada only twice since March 2005 for short visits to Dubai to see his family;\nMr. Suleiman's residence with his cousin for about 7 months when he returned to Canada in 2005, and then in the apartment that his brother owned after his wife and children moved out of it, until 2010;\nMr. Suleiman's contentious divorce proceedings, finally disposed of in 2011.\n[8]\nThe citizenship judge then referred to the credibility concerns raised by the citizenship officer with regard to Mr. Suleiman's file, and cited:\nInconsistencies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the evidence from the court decision in his divorce proceedings regarding the termination of his employment in Dubai;\nThe absence of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport;\nA United Arab Emirates [UAE] stamp dated \"25 May 2005\", a date not declared by Mr. Suleiman;\nA UAE residence visa in Mr. Suleiman's passport for the entire period of reference;\nThe absence or scarcity of financial documents for 2005 and 2006;\nAn absence of evidence of mortgage, rent or utility payments during the period of reference.\n[9]\nThe citizenship judge reviewed each of the citizenship officer's concerns about Mr. Suleiman's file and discussed them in the decision. Specifically, the citizenship judge concluded that it was difficult to determine the extent of inconsistencies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the court decision on his divorce because the remarks in the divorce court order regarding Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai were \"very vague\".\n[10]\nThe citizenship judge found that the lack of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport could not lead to any conclusions as the Canadian Border Services Agency at Pearson Airport routinely did not stamp permanent residents' passports returning to Canada during that time period.\n[11]\nFurther to his examination of Mr. Suleiman's passport, the citizenship judge concluded that a \"May 25, 2006\" (not 2005) stamp was clearly visible, a date corresponding with an absence from Canada declared by Mr. Suleiman.\n[12]\nIn addressing the citizenship officer's concern that Mr. Suleiman's passport contained a UAE residence visa during the period of reference, the citizenship judge found that the visa did not cover the entire period, and noted that visas are routinely not cancelled when a person leaves Dubai while the visa is valid.\n[13]\nThe citizenship judge acknowledged the citizenship officer's concern regarding the lack of financial documents for 2005, the paucity of those for 2006 and the dearth of evidence regarding rent/mortgage or utility payments; however, he accepted Mr. Suleiman's explanation that he did not work in 2005, and that his income was small in 2006 as he only started working when his financial resources were depleted. The citizenship judge also noted Mr. Suleiman's explanation that his ex-wife had kept and destroyed most of his documents, and that he had not disclosed his divorce on his residency questionnaire because he was ashamed and the divorce had not been finalized until 2011.\n[14]\nThe citizenship judge found the documentation and explanations from Mr. Suleiman credible as they substantiated his claim that he resided in Canada during the time he had declared residence in the country. The citizenship judge further noted the absence of evidence that Mr. Suleiman had travelled outside Canada other than for his declared absences.\n[15]\nThe citizenship judge concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Suleiman had demonstrated that he had resided in Canada for a sufficient number of days to meet the residency requirement of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the\nCitizenship Act\n.\nIII.\nAnalysis\nA.\nWere the conclusions of the citizenship judge on Mr. Suleiman's residence in Canada unreasonable?\n[16]\nThe Minister alleges that the citizenship judge made a number of incorrect factual findings in his decision, sufficient to render his decision unreasonable. Mr. Suleiman replies that the citizenship judge had the opportunity to assess his credibility during a hearing which lasted over two and a half hours, and that the Minister has not produced a transcript of such hearing. In his decision, the citizenship judge found the explanations of Mr. Suleiman credible. Counsel for Mr. Suleiman acknowledged that there could be minor discrepancies between Mr. Suleiman's application and the residency questionnaire but contends that these have no material impact on the physical test of residence used by the citizenship judge, given that Mr. Suleiman exceeded the residence requirement by a significant margin of about 300 days.\n[17]\nI agree with Mr. Suleiman and am satisfied that the citizenship judge's findings were reasonable and that the minor discrepancies identified by the Minister were not material enough to render the decision unreasonable. The judge engaged in a thorough and detailed assessment of the evidence on Mr. Suleiman's presence in Canada. While the citizenship judge could perhaps have provided additional reasons to support certain findings, there is no fatal flaw to his reasoning and I am satisfied that he considered the totality of the evidence.\n[18]\nIt is well established that the standard of reasonableness applies to a review of a citizenship judge's decision in determining whether the residency requirement has been met (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[19]\nWhen reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis is concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. Findings involving questions of facts or mixed fact and law should not be disturbed provided that the decision \"falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In conducting a reasonableness review of factual findings, it is not the role of the Court to reweigh the evidence or the relative importance given by the immigration officer to any relevant factor ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Under a reasonableness standard, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency, and intelligibility, a reviewing court should not substitute its own view of a preferable outcome (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSafi\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[20]\nIt is also settled law that the courts owe significant deference to credibility findings made by boards and tribunals (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 4;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In particular, the credibility findings of citizenship judges deserve such deference because they are better situated to \"make the factual determination as to whether the threshold question of the existence of a residence has been established\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[21]\nThe Minister contends that the citizenship judge made several incorrect factual findings with respect to passport issues, discrepancies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the evidence in the divorce court order, and Mr. Suleiman's travels outside of Canada in 2004 and 2005.\n[22]\nThe Minister's arguments on these factual findings invite the Court to substitute its view of the evidence for that of the citizenship judge. The judge heard from Mr. Suleiman directly at the hearing and thoroughly reviewed the evidence before reaching the conclusion that Mr. Suleiman had resided the sufficient number of days in Canada in the period of reference. The Minister has not pointed to evidence that contradicts this finding. There is also no basis for an inference that the citizenship judge ignored material evidence that squarely contradicted his conclusions (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 3). A failure to mention an element of evidence does not mean that it was ignored or that there was a reviewable error. In this case, the judge has also had the benefit of a long hearing with Mr. Suleiman, for which there is no transcript to contradict the evidence on the record or the affidavit filed by Mr. Suleiman. The decision of the citizenship judge evidently took into account the oral evidence provided by Mr. Suleiman. A review of the decision shows that the judge found the following:\nMr. Suleiman terminated his employment in Dubai at the beginning of 2005 and returned to Canada in March 2005, after finalizing his affairs in Dubai;\nMr. Suleiman left Canada only twice since March 2005 for short visits to Dubai to see his family;\nMr. Suleiman had places of residence in Canada when he returned to Canada in 2005 and throughout the period of reference, first with his cousin and afterwards in an apartment owned by his brother;\nMr. Suleiman had not travelled outside of Canada other than for his declared absences;\nThere were satisfactory explanations for the absence of Canadian re-entry stamps on Mr. Suleiman's passport, the alleged \"25 May 2005\" stamp date and the UAE residence visa in Mr. Suleiman's passport.\n[24]\nIn view of these elements, it was reasonable for the citizenship judge to conclude that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement. I further note that this is not a situation where Mr. Suleiman was close to the minimum number of days required to meet the physical test of residence; even with some minor discrepancies in the evidence relating to some travel dates, he was well above the 1095 day threshold.\n[25]\nI now turn to the more specific allegations made by the Minister. The Minister challenges the citizenship judge's statement that the remarks made in the divorce proceedings regarding Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai were \"very vague\". The divorce court order reported that Mr. Suleiman had indicated a termination of his employment in Dubai sometime in 2005 or 2006; since Mr. Suleiman had responded in his residency questionnaire that his employment in Dubai rather ended prior to his entry in Canada in July 2004, the Minister contends that Mr. Suleiman either provided inaccurate information in his residency questionnaire or in the divorce court proceedings. I do not find that the judge's conclusion on Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai is unreasonable. In his decision, the citizenship judge reports that, based on the evidence before him, Mr. Suleiman returned to Canada in March 2005 and terminated his employment in Dubai in early 2005; this does not contradict the divorce court order. Mr. Suleiman also points out that, in his affidavit (which was not contradicted), the citizenship judge did in fact question him about this specific issue during the hearing, and was satisfied with his response.\n[26]\nWhile the judge could arguably have elaborated further on the apparent discrepancy with the residency questionnaire, it does not make his decision on this point unreasonable. His finding is rather supported by evidence on the record. Furthermore, I agree with Mr. Suleiman that this alleged discrepancy is in any event peripheral and immaterial to the decision given that the termination of his employment in Dubai was before the period of reference ranging from April 2005 to April 2009.\n[27]\nThe Minister is right to point out that there remains at all times a positive obligation on the citizenship applicants to provide true, correct, and complete information and to refrain from making false declarations. This however does not mean that corroborative evidence is required on every single element. It is well recognized that the\nCitizenship Act\ndoes not require corroboration on all counts; instead, it is \"the responsibility of the original decision-maker, taking the context into consideration, to determine the extent and nature of the evidence required\" (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nEl Bousserghini\n]). The citizenship judge may not have reconciled the apparent discrepancy as clearly as the Minister would have liked to see it in his reasons, or explained in as much detail as the Minister would have hoped how Mr. Suleiman convinced the judge that the discrepancy did not harm his credibility. But there is nothing to indicate that the judge's finding on Mr. Suleiman's return to Canada prior to the beginning of the reference period was not reasonable.\n[28]\nThe Minister also submits that the citizenship judge made a factual error on Mr. Suleiman's travel dates to Dubai from October to December 2004, and from December 2004 or January 2005 to March 2005. I again note that these trips occurred before the period of reference and have no impact on the calculations for the residence requirements. Given that the citizenship judge had the benefit of the hearing with Mr. Suleiman, I find that the citizenship judge was entitled not to draw an adverse credibility finding out of such evidence.\n[29]\nThe Minister further contends that the citizenship judge made a factual error by stating that Mr. Suleiman only left Canada twice since his return in March 2005, whereas his citizenship application and residency questionnaire indicate that he had actually left Canada three times. Assuming there is a discrepancy, the evidence shows that, in the worst-case scenario, the difference adds up to some 14 days of absence from Canada (73 days as opposed to 59) out of the 1460 days considered for the residency period. I agree with counsel for Mr. Suleiman that such a minor difference is of no relevance, considering that the citizenship judge also concluded that all the trips of Mr. Suleiman outside of Canada had been declared. Once again, it was therefore not unreasonable for the citizenship judge not to refer to this extensively in his decision.\n[30]\nThis is not a situation where, as in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the exercise of discretion by the citizenship judge went too far and the judge accepted weak and unconceivable explanations on unreported absences with no further inquiries (at paras 23 and 30). In the present case, the citizenship judge reviewed these concerns with Mr. Suleiman at the hearing and concluded that Mr. Suleiman had met his onus to establish residence through sufficient and credible evidence. All of the alleged errors or discrepancies identified by the Minister relate to factual findings made by the citizenship judge after he had the opportunity to question the credibility of Mr. Suleiman at the hearing and after he was satisfied about it. Furthermore, they are discrepancies regarding events that occurred outside of the period of reference, and would not have affected the outcome of the residency requirement. The minor factual errors identified by the Minister are far from making the decision unreasonable and are not significant enough to warrant this Court's intervention.\n[31]\nAs this Court stated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  immaterial errors, even if there are several, are not sufficient to render a decision unreasonable. An imperfect decision with immaterial errors remains reasonable.\n[32]\nThe Minister also takes issue with the manner in which the citizenship judge weighed Mr. Suleiman's declarations against the objective evidence, submitting that the citizenship judge did not hold Mr. Suleiman to his evidentiary onus under the\nCitizenship Act\n. The Minister contends that Mr. Suleiman did not provide objective corroborative evidence to establish his residence in Canada between April 2005 and June 2006, and that this was unreasonable given the discrepancies in the evidence. The Minister submits that the lack of Canadian re-entry stamps and documentary evidence establishing residency in Canada is important because the citizenship judge failed to assess whether, in absence of such corroborative evidence, Mr. Suleiman was able to meet his evidentiary onus.\n[33]\nI do not agree with this reading of the decision. I rather conclude that the decision reflects that the citizenship judge turned his mind to those issues and addressed them. He found that the absence of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport could not lead to any conclusions given the Canada Border Services Agency's practice of not stamping permanent residents' passports returning to Canada during that period. He also reviewed and considered the paucity of financial documents for 2005 and 2006 and the lack of evidence regarding rent/mortgage or utility payments made by Mr. Suleiman, and accepted Mr. Suleiman's explanation about his unemployment in 2005, the depletion of his financial resources in 2006 and the destruction of documents by his ex-wife in the context of his divorce. It was certainly not unreasonable, in light of such evidence, for the citizenship judge to conclude that Mr. Suleiman met his onus of demonstrating residence in Canada in the period of reference. The citizenship judge found the documentation and explanations provided by Mr. Suleiman credible as they substantiated his claim that he resided in Canada during the time he had declared residence in the country.\n[34]\nThe Court understands the Minister's desire to receive more detailed or more complete reasons from a citizenship judge, as the process established by the\nCitizenship Act\nrequires a citizenship officer to refer a matter to a citizenship judge when the officer has concerns and is not satisfied that residency requirements are met. But the test this Court has to apply is not whether the decision satisfies the expectations of the Minister; the test is the reasonableness of the decision. None of the conclusions of the citizenship judge are outside the range of reasonableness. Where there might have been some alleged inconsistencies, they were either immaterial or could be reasonably reconciled within the decision.\n[35]\nI find the ultimate result reasonable considering the totality of the evidence and the applicable legal principles. The decision falls within a range of reasonable alternatives defensible in respect of the facts and the law, and this Court should not interfere with it on judicial review.\nB.\nWere the reasons provided by the citizenship judge in support of his decision sufficient and adequate?\n[36]\nThe Minister submits that the citizenship judge's reasons are inadequate in that they do not show a grasp of the issues raised by the evidence, let alone the concerns raised by the citizenship officer for the citizenship judge's consideration. As such, they do not allow a reviewing party to understand why the citizenship judge made his decision. I do not agree and rather find that the citizenship judge's reasons were adequate.\n[37]\nThe law relating to the sufficiency of reasons in administrative decision-making has evolved substantially since <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , both with respect to the degree of scrutiny to which fact-based decisions such as the decision at issue in this case should be subjected, and in relation to the sufficiency of reasons as a stand-alone ground for judicial review. In\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [\nNewfoundland Nurses\n], the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance on how to approach situations where decision-makers provide brief or limited reasons. An alleged insufficiency of reasons is no longer a stand-alone basis for granting judicial review: reasons need not be fulsome or perfect, and need not address all of the evidence or arguments put forward by a party or in the record.\n[38]\nThe decision-maker is not required to refer to each and every detail supporting his or her conclusion. It is sufficient if the reasons permit the Court to understand why the decision was made and determine whether the conclusion falls within the range of possible acceptable outcomes (\nNewfoundland Nurses\nat para 16). The reasons are to be read as a whole, in conjunction with the record, in order to determine whether the reasons provide the justification, transparency and intelligibility required of a reasonable decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This Court discussed the issue of adequacy of reasons in a citizenship judge's decision in the recent\nSafi\ndecision. In that decision, Justice Kane echoed the\nNewfoundland Nurses\nprinciples and stated that the decision-maker is not required to set out every reason, argument or detail in the reasons, or to make an explicit finding on each element that leads to the final conclusion. The reasons are to \"be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes\" (\nSafi\nat para 17).\n[39]\nIn this case, the citizenship judge's decision meets this standard; the reasons clearly explain why he decided that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement and how he considered the evidence. Consequently, there is no merit to the argument that the judge's reasons were insufficient. The focus of judicial review remains on the outcome or decision itself, and not the process by which that outcome was reached. A reviewing court looks to the record with a view to upholding the decision; where readily apparent, evidentiary gaps may be filled in when supported by the evidence, and logical inferences implicit to the result may be drawn (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). That said, I acknowledge that\nNewfoundland Nurses\nis not an invitation to the Court to provide reasons that were not given, nor is it a licence to guess what findings might have been made or to speculate as to what a decision-maker might have been thinking. However, this is not the case here; rather, it is a situation where the reviewing court can connect the dots and draw the lines in the citizenship judge's decision.\n[40]\nIn this application for judicial review, it is the Minister's burden to persuade this Court that its intervention is warranted. However, it was Mr. Suleiman's duty to provide sufficient evidence that he met the residency requirement, and it was the citizenship judge's duty to provide reasons to show how he arrived at his decision (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is what the citizenship judge did.\n[41]\nReasonableness, not perfection, is the standard. In citizenship matters, reasons for decision are often very brief and do not always address all discrepancies in the evidence. However, even where the reasons for the decision are brief, or poorly written, this Court should defer to the decision-maker's weighing of the evidence and credibility determinations, as long as the Court is able to understand why the citizenship judge made its decision (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nThomas\n];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLee\n];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\n[42]\nIn\nThomas\n, for example, the citizenship judge found that the respondent was credible, addressed the citizenship officer's concerns and accepted the respondent's explanations. In response to the Minister's argument that there was insufficient evidence, Justice Mosley noted that, although the notes could have been clearer and more thorough, the ultimate decision rested on a reasonable assessment of the evidence, including the explanations provided by the respondent. Justice Mosley pointed out that the case did not contain unexplained gaps in the evidence, as the respondent had provided explanations that the citizenship judge found credible. Justice Mosley reminded that the Court must defer to the decision-maker's weighing of the evidence and credibility determination in absence of clear error (\nThomas\nat paras 33-34).\n[43]\nCases where the Court agreed to intervene are distinguishable from the present one. In\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the citizenship officer had highlighted various concerns including a visa on a date where the applicant claimed to be in Canada, bank statements that were generally abundant but had periods of no activity when she was supposed to be in Canada, and doctor's visits on dates where she was supposed to be traveling. Justice Boivin found that the decision was not reasonable because these gaps in the evidence were not addressed, and the Court was unable to understand the citizenship judge's reasoning ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 28). In\nSafi\n, Justice Kane acknowledged that some of the unaddressed inadequacies were not important and likely the cause of a simple misunderstanding, but noted that there were problematic issues that required more careful scrutiny including illegible passport stamps, a failure to declare certain travel, and a visa issued in another name. Justice Kane found it was not clear how the citizenship judge weighed the evidence, and appeared to have ignored evidence which should have alerted him to probe further (\nSafi\nat paras 44-45).\n[44]\nIn\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration\n)\nv Jeizan\n, 2010 FC 323, Justice de Montigny found the extent of the short fall in days of residence to be much higher than what the citizenship judge had identified and the limited documentary proof to be problematic, particularly since numerous receipts provided to establish the applicant's presence in Canada were on dates she had admitted to not being present in the country. This Court has also quashed decisions of a citizenship judge to grant citizenship where it found the respondent had engaged in substantial misrepresentation (often involving substantial absences from Canada) that was not addressed by the citizenship judge's decision (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[45]\nThe present case is different. The citizenship judge identified the residency test he relied on and addressed the credibility concerns raised by the citizenship officer; there were no gaps in evidence or periods unaccounted for. I have no hesitation to conclude that the reasons are sufficient and adequate with regard to the test established by\nNewfoundland Nurses\n. It is clear from the decision why the citizenship judge approved Mr. Suleiman's application and dismissed the citizenship officer's concerns.\nC.\nAre there special reasons to award costs in this case?\n[46]\nMr. Suleiman asks for costs, given that the application for judicial review was ill-founded and there was an inordinate five-year delay before the citizenship judge adjudicated his citizenship application.\n[47]\nCosts are not ordinarily awarded in immigration proceedings in this Court, as Rule 22 of the\nFederal Courts\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22 provides that \"[n]o costs shall be awarded to or payable by any party in respect of an application for leave, an application for judicial review or an appeal under these Rules unless the Court, for special reasons, so orders.\" While each case turns on its own particular circumstances, the threshold for establishing the existence of \"special reasons\" is high (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In the circumstances of this case, I do not find that there are special reasons warranting an order of costs.\n[48]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Federal Court of Appeal provided a detailed summary of the circumstances in which the Court has recognized \"special circumstances\" meriting an award of costs. This decision observed that, based on an analysis of the jurisprudence, \"special reasons\" justifying an award of costs against the Minister have been found to exist where:\n- The Minister causes an applicant to suffer a significant waste of time and resources by taking inconsistent positions in the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal;\n- An immigration official circumvents an order of the Court;\n- An immigration official engages in conduct that is misleading or abusive;\n- An immigration official issues a decision only after an unreasonable and unjustified delay;\n- The Minister unreasonably opposes an obviously meritorious application for judicial review.\n[49]\nI do not find that the circumstances of this case are similar or close to those situations which have justified an order of costs. Special reasons do not arise merely because the Minister elected to exercise his statutory right to apply for judicial review of a decision and is not successful. Furthermore, I agree with the Minister that the five-year delay between Mr. Suleiman's application and the citizenship judge's decision does not amount to a sufficient reason for costs, as Mr. Suleiman could have sought the Court's assistance to deal with any prejudice he might have suffered during those five years, but elected not to do it.\n[50]\nI am therefore not persuaded that \"special reasons\" exist in this case that would justify an order of costs, and I decline to make such an order.\nIV.\nConclusion\n[51]\nFor the reasons set forth above, this application for judicial review is dismissed. Although the Minister might have preferred a more elaborate decision, the citizenship judge addressed all concerns that were raised by the citizenship officer in his decision and explained why they did not impact his finding on residence requirement. His decision was reasonable and provided adequate reasons. I do not find that there were unreasonable factual findings made by the citizenship judge or that the judge lacked a grasp of the issues raised by the citizenship officer. Instead, the citizenship judge addressed the concerns that were raised, first discussing them with Mr. Suleiman, and then explaining them in his decision.\nJUDGMENT\n[52]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthis application for judicial review is dismissed, without costs.\n.........................\nLe Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Canada en juillet 2004 et est devenu résident permanent le jour même. Il a présenté une demande de citoyenneté canadienne le 1er avril 2009. Puisque l'agent de la citoyenneté chargé de l'examen de sa demande n'était pas convaincu que M. Suleiman satisfaisait aux obligations de résidence au cours de la période de référence visée, M. Suleiman a rempli un questionnaire sur la résidence. En avril 2014, après avoir examiné la demande de M. Suleiman, son questionnaire sur la résidence et d'autres documents, l'agent de la citoyenneté a soulevé certaines préoccupations à l'égard du dossier de M. Suleiman et de la crédibilité de ses déclarations au sujet de sa présence au Canada.\n[2]\nL'affaire a donc été renvoyée à un juge de la citoyenneté qui a tenu une audience de deux heures et demie avec M. Suleiman en octobre 2014, dans le cadre de laquelle il l'a questionné et a discuté des préoccupations concernant le nombre de jours qu'il a résidé au Canada. Le juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que M. Suleiman satisfaisait aux obligations de résidence et, le 20 octobre 2014, il a approuvé la demande de citoyenneté de M. Suleiman.\n[3]\nLe ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration a présenté une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision du juge de la citoyenneté au motif que le juge a tiré de nombreuses conclusions de fait erronées et n'a pas fait montre d'une compréhension des préoccupations soulevées par l'agent de la citoyenneté. De même, le ministre affirme que les motifs du juge de la citoyenneté à l'appui de sa décision étaient inadéquats et insuffisants. En réponse, M. Suleiman soutient que la décision du juge de la citoyenneté était raisonnable et que les erreurs de fait relevées par le ministre étaient sans conséquence sur la décision. De plus, M. Suleiman réclame des dépens au ministre.\n[4]\nL'issue de la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire repose sur les évaluations de la crédibilité effectuées par le juge de la citoyenneté à l'égard de la résidence au Canada de M. Suleiman et sur le caractère suffisant de ses motifs. Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire du ministre est rejetée. Je ne suis pas convaincu que la décision du juge de la citoyenneté est déraisonnable ni que les divergences relevées par le ministre étaient essentielles à la décision du juge. Je conclus également que les motifs de la décision expliquent de manière adéquate comment le juge de la citoyenneté est parvenu à la conclusion que M. Suleiman avait satisfait à l'obligation de résidence. Toutefois, je suis d'accord avec le ministre qu'il n'y a pas de raisons spéciales justifiant l'adjudication de dépens à M. Suleiman en l'espèce.\nII.\nContexte\n[5]\nDans sa décision datée du 20 octobre 2014, le juge de la citoyenneté a conclu, selon la prépondérance de la preuve, que M. Suleiman a satisfait à l'obligation de résidence prévue à l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n, LRC 1985, c 29, pour obtenir la citoyenneté canadienne, comme il a été établi dans la décision\nRe Pourghasemi\n(1993), 62 FTR. 122, 19 Imm. LR. (2d) 259 (CF 1re inst). Ce critère de présence effective prévoit que le ministre doit attribuer la citoyenneté à toute personne qui, au cours de la période de référence visée de 4 ans, soit 1 460 jours, a résidé au Canada pendant au moins 3 ans (soit 1 095 jours) en tout.\n[6]\nLe juge de la citoyenneté a établi la période de référence du 1er avril 2005 au 1er avril 2009 et a souligné que M. Suleiman avait déclaré 1 402 jours de présence au Canada et 58 jours d'absence du Canada au cours de cette période.\n[7]\nAprès avoir résumé les étapes ayant mené à sa décision, y compris son examen du questionnaire sur la résidence et des documents présentés par M. Suleiman ainsi que la comparution de M. Suleiman à une audience devant lui, le juge de la citoyenneté a énoncé les faits tels qu'il les comprenait. Plus particulièrement, le juge de la citoyenneté a tenu compte de ce qui suit:\nLes 20 années d'expérience de travail de M. Suleiman acquises à Dubaï au sein d'Ernst and Young et la cessation de son emploi au début de 2005;\nL'arrivée au Canada de M. Suleiman avec sa famille en juillet 2004 et son voyage de retour à Dubaï environ trois mois plus tard pour y régler ses affaires;\nLe retour au Canada de M. Suleiman en mars 2005;\nLe fait que M. Suleiman n'a quitté le Canada que deux fois depuis mars 2005 pour faire de courts séjours à Dubaï afin de voir sa famille;\nLe fait que M. Suleiman a résidé avec son cousin pendant environ sept mois lorsqu'il est revenu au Canada en 2005, puis dans l'appartement qui appartenait à son frère après que son épouse et ses enfants en sont déménagés, jusqu'en 2010;\nL'action en divorce de M. Suleiman, finalement réglée en 2011.\n[8]\nLe juge de la citoyenneté a ensuite renvoyé aux préoccupations en matière de crédibilité soulevées par l'agent de la citoyenneté en ce qui concerne le dossier de M. Suleiman et a invoqué:\nLes incohérences entre le questionnaire sur la résidence de M. Suleiman et les éléments de preuve de la décision rendue dans son action en divorce relativement à la cessation de son emploi à Dubaï;\nL'absence de timbres d'entrée au Canada dans le passeport de M. Suleiman;\nUn timbre des Émirats arabes unis daté du [traduction]  25 mai 2005 , une date non déclarée par M. Suleiman;\nUn visa de résident des Émirats arabes unis dans le passeport de M. Suleiman valide pendant toute la période de référence;\nL'absence ou la rareté de documents financiers pour 2005 et 2006;\nL'absence d'éléments de preuve de paiements d'hypothèque, de loyer ou de services publics au cours de la période de référence.\n[9]\nLe juge de la citoyenneté a examiné chacune des préoccupations de l'agent de la citoyenneté au sujet du dossier de M. Suleiman et en a discuté dans la décision. Plus particulièrement, le juge de la citoyenneté a conclu qu'il était difficile d'établir le degré d'incohérence entre le questionnaire sur la résidence de M. Suleiman et la décision rendue dans son action en divorce puisque les observations figurant dans l'ordonnance rendue dans le divorce concernant l'emploi à Dubaï de M. Suleiman étaient [traduction]  très vagues .\n[10]\nLe juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que l'absence de timbres d'entrée au Canada dans le passeport de M. Suleiman ne pouvait permettre de tirer des conclusions puisque les agents de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada à l'aéroport Pearson n'ont pas systématiquement estampillé le passeport des résidents permanents qui sont rentrés au Canada au cours de cette période.\n[11]\nÀ la suite de son examen du passeport de M. Suleiman, le juge de la citoyenneté a conclu qu'un timbre du [traduction]  25 mai 2006  (et non 2005) était clairement visible, soit une date correspondant à une absence du Canada déclarée par M. Suleiman.\n[12]\nPour donner suite à la préoccupation de l'agent de la citoyenneté selon laquelle le passeport de M. Suleiman contenait un visa de résidence des Émirats arabes unis valide au cours de la période de référence, le juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que le visa ne visait pas toute la période, et a fait remarquer que couramment, les visas ne sont pas annulés lorsqu'une personne quitte Dubaï pendant qu'un visa est valide.\n[13]\nLe juge de la citoyenneté a reconnu la préoccupation de l'agent de citoyenneté au sujet de l'absence de documents financiers pour 2005, de la rareté de ceux pour 2006 et du manque d'éléments de preuve concernant les paiements de loyer ou d'hypothèque ou de services publics; toutefois, il a accepté l'explication de M. Suleiman selon laquelle il n'a pas travaillé en 2005, et que son revenu était faible en 2006, car il n'a commencé à travailler que lorsqu'il a épuisé ses ressources financières. Le juge de la citoyenneté a également souligné l'explication de M. Suleiman voulant que son ex-épouse ait conservé et détruit la plupart de ses documents, et qu'il n'avait pas divulgué son divorce sur son questionnaire sur la résidence parce qu'il en avait honte et que ce n'est qu'en 2011 que le divorce a été réglé.\n[14]\nLe juge de la citoyenneté a jugé crédibles la documentation et les explications de M. Suleiman puisqu'elles corroboraient sa déclaration selon laquelle il résidait au Canada pendant la période où il avait déclaré résider au pays. En outre, le juge de la citoyenneté a souligné l'absence d'éléments de preuve selon lesquels M. Suleiman a quitté le Canada à des fins autres que ses absences déclarées.\n[15]\nLe juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, M. Suleiman avait démontré qu'il avait résidé au Canada pendant un nombre suffisant de jours pour satisfaire à l'obligation de résidence visée à l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n.\nIII.\nAnalyse\nA.\nLes conclusions du juge de la citoyenneté relativement à la résidence de M. Suleiman au Canada étaient-elles déraisonnables?\n[16]\nLe ministre fait valoir que le juge de la citoyenneté a tiré un certain nombre de conclusions de fait erronées dans sa décision, ce qui suffit à rendre sa décision déraisonnable. Monsieur Suleiman répond que le juge de la citoyenneté a eu l'occasion d'évaluer sa crédibilité au cours d'une audience qui a duré plus de deux heures et demie, et que le ministre n'a pas produit de transcription de l'audience. Dans sa décision, le juge de la citoyenneté a jugé crédibles les explications de M. Suleiman. L'avocat de M. Suleiman a reconnu qu'il pourrait y avoir des divergences mineures entre la demande et le questionnaire sur la résidence de M. Suleiman, mais indique que ces divergences n'ont aucune conséquence importante sur le critère de présence effective appliqué par le juge de la citoyenneté, étant donné que M. Suleiman dépassait l'obligation de résidence d'une marge considérable d'environ 300 jours.\n[17]\nJe suis d'accord avec M. Suleiman et je suis convaincu que les conclusions du juge de la citoyenneté sont raisonnables et que les divergences mineures relevées par le ministre ne sont pas suffisamment importantes pour rendre la décision déraisonnable. Le juge a procédé à un examen approfondi et détaillé des éléments de preuve liés à la présence de M. Suleiman au Canada. Le juge de la citoyenneté aurait peut-être pu donner d'autres motifs à l'appui de certaines conclusions, mais son raisonnement ne présente aucune lacune déterminante et je suis convaincu qu'il a tenu compte de l'ensemble de la preuve.\n[18]\nIl est bien établi que la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique à un examen de la décision du juge de la citoyenneté en vue de décider si l'obligation de résidence a été satisfaite [\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[19]\nLorsqu'il s'agit d'examiner une décision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse tient compte de la justification de la décision, de la transparence et de l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel. Les conclusions comportant des questions de fait ou des questions mixtes de fait et de droit ne doivent pas être modifiées à condition que la décision appartienne aux  issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit  [\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Lorsqu'il s'agit d'examiner des conclusions de fait selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour n'a pas pour rôle d'apprécier de nouveau les éléments de preuve ni l'importance relative accordée par l'agent d'immigration à tout facteur pertinent [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, si le processus et l'issue en cause cadrent bien avec les principes de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité, la cour de révision ne doit pas y substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable [\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSafi\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n[20]\nDe même, il est bien établi en droit que les tribunaux doivent faire preuve d'un degré élevé de retenue à l'égard des conclusions relatives à la crédibilité que tirent les organismes et tribunaux administratifs [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), au paragraphe 4;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Plus particulièrement, il y a lieu de faire preuve d'une telle retenue à l'égard des conclusions quant à la crédibilité tirées par les juges de la citoyenneté puisque ces derniers sont les mieux placés pour  tirer une conclusion de fait quant à savoir si a été établie, à titre de question préliminaire, l'existence d'une \"résidence\"  [\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n[21]\nLe ministre allègue que le juge de la citoyenneté a tiré plusieurs conclusions de fait erronées en ce qui concerne les questions liées au passeport, les divergences entre le questionnaire sur la résidence de M. Suleiman et les éléments de preuve figurant dans l'ordonnance de divorce du tribunal, ainsi que les déplacements de M. Suleiman à l'extérieur du Canada en 2004 et en 2005.\n[22]\nLes arguments du ministre en ce qui a trait à ces conclusions de fait invitent la Cour à substituer son point de vue concernant les éléments de preuve à celui du juge de la citoyenneté. Le juge a entendu le témoignage de M. Suleiman directement à l'audience et a soigneusement examiné les éléments de preuve avant d'arriver à la conclusion que le nombre de jours pendant lesquels M. Suleiman avait résidé au Canada au cours de la période de référence était suffisant. Le ministre n'a montré aucun élément de preuve qui contredit cette conclusion. Rien ne permet non plus de conclure que le juge de la citoyenneté n'a pas tenu compte des éléments de preuve substantiels qui contredisaient carrément ses conclusions [\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst), au paragraphe 17].\n[23]\nUn décideur tel qu'un juge de la citoyenneté est réputé avoir pris en considération tous les éléments de preuve au dossier [\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), au paragraphe 3]. Le défaut de mentionner un élément de preuve ne signifie pas qu'il n'a pas été pris en compte ni qu'une erreur susceptible de contrôle a été commise. En l'espèce, le juge a également eu l'occasion de tenir une longue audience avec M. Suleiman, pour laquelle il n'existe aucune transcription contredisant les éléments de preuve au dossier ou l'affidavit déposé par M. Suleiman. Dans sa décision, le juge de la citoyenneté a, de toute évidence, pris en considération le témoignage oral fourni par M. Suleiman. Un examen de la décision révèle que le juge a conclu ce qui suit:\nM. Suleiman a quitté son emploi à Dubaï au début de 2005 et est revenu au Canada en mars 2005, après avoir réglé ses affaires à Dubaï;\nM. Suleiman n'a quitté le Canada que deux fois depuis mars 2005 pour faire de courts séjours à Dubaï afin de voir sa famille;\nM. Suleiman avait des lieux de résidence au Canada lorsqu'il est revenu au pays en 2005 et tout au long de la période de référence, d'abord avec son cousin puis dans un appartement appartenant à son frère;\nM. Suleiman n'avait pas voyagé à l'extérieur du Canada à des fins autres que ses absences déclarées;\nIl y a eu des explications satisfaisantes en ce qui concerne l'absence de timbres d'entrée canadiens sur le passeport de M. Suleiman, la prétendue date du timbre du [traduction]  25 mai 2005  et le visa de résidence des Émirats arabes unis dans le passeport de M. Suleiman.\n[24]\nAu vu de ces éléments, il était raisonnable pour le juge de la citoyenneté de conclure que M. Suleiman satisfaisait à l'obligation de résidence. En outre, j'observe qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une situation où la durée de résidence de M. Suleiman était près du nombre minimal de jours nécessaires pour respecter le critère de présence effective; même en présence de légères divergences dans les éléments de preuve en ce qui touche certaines dates de voyage, la durée de résidence de M. Suleiman était bien au-dessus du seuil de 1 095 jours.\n[25]\nJe me tourne maintenant vers les allégations plus précises soulevées par le ministre. Le ministre conteste la déclaration du juge de la citoyenneté selon laquelle les remarques faites dans le cadre de l'action en divorce concernant l'emploi de M. Suleiman à Dubaï étaient [traduction]  très vagues . Selon l'ordonnance de divorce du tribunal, M. Suleiman a indiqué que son emploi à Dubaï avait pris fin en 2005 ou 2006; étant donné que M. Suleiman a déclaré dans son questionnaire sur la résidence que son emploi avait plutôt pris fin avant son entrée au Canada en juillet 2004, le ministre affirme que M. Suleiman a fourni des renseignements inexacts dans son questionnaire sur la résidence ou dans le cadre de l'action en divorce. Je ne juge pas déraisonnable la conclusion tirée par le juge relativement à l'emploi de M. Suleiman à Dubaï. Dans sa décision, le juge de la citoyenneté a indiqué que, d'après la preuve dont il disposait, M. Suleiman est revenu au Canada en mars 2005 et a mis fin à son emploi à Dubaï au début de 2005; cela ne contredit pas l'ordonnance de divorce du tribunal. De même, M. Suleiman souligne que, dans son affidavit (qui n'a pas été contredit), le juge de la citoyenneté l'a effectivement interrogé au sujet de cette question précise au cours de l'audience et était satisfait de sa réponse.\n[26]\nLe juge aurait sans doute pu expliquer de façon plus approfondie la divergence évidente en ce qui a trait au questionnaire sur la résidence, mais sa décision à cet égard n'est pas pour autant déraisonnable. Sa conclusion est plutôt fondée sur la preuve au dossier. En outre, je conviens avec M. Suleiman que cette divergence est de toute façon accessoire et sans importance sur la décision puisque la date de cessation de son emploi à Dubaï précède la période de référence allant d'avril 2005 à avril 2009.\n[27]\nLe ministre a raison de souligner que les demandeurs de la citoyenneté ont, en tout temps, une obligation positive de fournir des renseignements véridiques, exacts et complets et de s'abstenir de faire de fausses déclarations. Toutefois, cela ne veut pas dire que chaque élément nécessite une preuve corroborante. Il est bien établi que la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\nn'exige pas la corroboration à tous les égards; plutôt, il  en revient au décideur initial, en tenant compte du contexte, de déterminer l'étendue et la nature de la preuve requise  [\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (\nEl Bousserghini\n)]. Le juge de la citoyenneté n'a peut-être pas concilié la divergence évidente aussi clairement que le ministre l'aurait souhaité dans ses motifs, ou expliqué de manière aussi détaillée que le ministre l'aurait espéré la façon dont M. Suleiman a convaincu le juge que la divergence ne nuisait pas à sa crédibilité. Toutefois, rien n'indique que la conclusion tirée par le juge relativement au retour de M. Suleiman au Canada avant le début de la période de référence était déraisonnable.\n[28]\nDe même, le ministre soutient que le juge de la citoyenneté a commis une erreur de fait en ce qui concerne les dates de voyage à Dubaï de M. Suleiman d'octobre à décembre 2004 et de décembre 2004 ou janvier 2005 à mars 2005. Là encore, je souligne que ces voyages ont eu lieu avant la période de référence et n'ont aucune incidence sur les calculs liés aux obligations de résidence. Étant donné que le juge de la citoyenneté a eu l'occasion de tenir une audience avec M. Suleiman, j'estime qu'il avait le droit de ne pas tirer une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité d'après les éléments de preuve.\n[29]\nLe ministre fait également valoir que le juge de la citoyenneté a commis une erreur de fait en déclarant que M. Suleiman n'a quitté le Canada que deux fois depuis son retour en mars 2005, alors que sa demande de citoyenneté et son questionnaire sur la résidence indiquent qu'il a en fait quitté le Canada trois fois. En supposant qu'il y ait une divergence, les éléments de preuve révèlent que, dans le pire des cas, la différence représente environ 14 jours d'absence du Canada (73 jours comparativement à 59) sur les 1 460 jours pris en considération pour la période de résidence. Je conviens avec l'avocat de M. Suleiman qu'une différence si mineure est sans intérêt, étant donné que le juge de la citoyenneté a également conclu que tous les voyages de M. Suleiman à l'extérieur du Canada avaient été déclarés. Là encore, il n'était donc pas déraisonnable pour le juge de la citoyenneté de ne pas en faire mention de façon détaillée dans sa décision.\n[30]\nIl ne s'agit pas d'une situation où, à l'instar de la décision\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge de la citoyenneté a excédé son pouvoir discrétionnaire et a accepté des explications chancelantes et invraisemblables concernant les absences non déclarées, et ce, sans essayer d'obtenir des précisions (aux paragraphes 23 et 30). En l'espèce, le juge de la citoyenneté a examiné ces préoccupations avec M. Suleiman à l'audience et a conclu que ce dernier s'était acquitté du fardeau d'établir la résidence au moyen d'éléments de preuve suffisants et crédibles. Toutes les erreurs ou divergences relevées par le ministre se rattachent aux conclusions de fait tirées par le juge de la citoyenneté après qu'il a eu l'occasion de mettre en doute la crédibilité de M. Suleiman lors de l'audience et après qu'il en a été satisfait. De plus, il s'agit de divergences concernant des événements qui se sont produits en dehors de la période de référence, et elles n'auraient eu aucune incidence sur le résultat lié à l'obligation de résidence. Les erreurs de fait mineures relevées par le ministre sont loin de rendre la décision déraisonnable et ne sont pas suffisamment importantes pour justifier l'intervention de la Cour.\n[31]\nComme l'a déclaré la Cour dans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  les erreurs sans conséquence, même s'il y en a plusieurs, ne suffisent pas à rendre une décision déraisonnable. Une décision imparfaite contenant des erreurs sans conséquence demeure raisonnable.\n[32]\nDe même, le ministre conteste la façon dont le juge de la citoyenneté a soupesé les déclarations de M. Suleiman en fonction de la preuve matérielle, faisant valoir que le juge de la citoyenneté n'a pas obligé M. Suleiman à s'acquitter de son fardeau de la preuve en vertu de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n. Le ministre indique que M. Suleiman n'a fourni aucune preuve matérielle corroborante visant à établir sa résidence au Canada au cours de la période d'avril 2005 à juin 2006, et que cela était déraisonnable compte tenu des divergences relevées dans la preuve. Le ministre soutient que l'absence de timbres d'entrée canadiens et de preuves documentaires établissant la résidence au Canada est importante puisque le juge de la citoyenneté a omis d'établir si, en l'absence des preuves corroborantes en cause, M. Suleiman a été en mesure de s'acquitter de son fardeau de preuve.\n[33]\nJe ne souscris pas à cette interprétation de la décision. Je conclus plutôt que la décision reflète que le juge de la citoyenneté a porté son attention sur ces questions et y a donné suite. Il a conclu que l'absence de timbres d'entrée canadiens dans le passeport de M. Suleiman ne permettrait de tirer aucune conclusion étant donné la pratique adoptée par l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada au cours de cette période, soit celle de ne pas estampiller le passeport des résidents permanents qui reviennent au Canada. Il a également examiné et pris en compte les documents financiers peu nombreux pour 2005 et 2006 ainsi que l'absence d'éléments de preuve concernant les paiements de loyer ou d'hypothèque ou de services publics effectués par M. Suleiman, et a accepté l'explication de M. Suleiman au sujet de sa période de chômage en 2005, de l'épuisement de ses ressources financières en 2006 et de la destruction de documents par son ex-épouse dans le contexte de son divorce. Au vu des éléments de preuve, il n'était assurément pas déraisonnable pour le juge de la citoyenneté de conclure que M. Suleiman s'est acquitté du fardeau de démontrer sa résidence au Canada au cours de la période de référence. Le juge de la citoyenneté a jugé crédibles la documentation et les explications fournies par M. Suleiman puisqu'elles corroboraient son affirmation selon laquelle il résidait au Canada au cours de la période où il avait déclaré résider au pays.\n[34]\nLa Cour comprend le désir du ministre de recevoir des motifs plus détaillés ou plus complets de la part d'un juge de la citoyenneté, puisque le processus établi par la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\nexige d'un agent de la citoyenneté qu'il renvoie une affaire devant un juge de la citoyenneté lorsqu'il a des préoccupations et n'est pas convaincu que les obligations de résidence sont satisfaites. Toutefois, le critère que doit appliquer la Cour ne consiste pas à savoir si la décision satisfait aux attentes du ministre; le critère vise le caractère raisonnable de la décision. Les conclusions tirées par le juge de la citoyenneté répondent toutes au critère du caractère raisonnable. Dans les cas où il aurait pu y avoir certaines divergences, celles-ci étaient sans importance ou pouvaient être conciliées de façon raisonnable dans la décision.\n[35]\nJe juge raisonnable l'issue finale compte tenu de l'ensemble de la preuve et des principes juridiques applicables. La décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit, et la Cour ne doit pas intervenir à cet égard dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire.\nB.\nLes motifs donnés par le juge de la citoyenneté pour appuyer sa décision étaient-ils suffisants et adéquats?\n[36]\nLe ministre soutient que les motifs donnés par le juge de la citoyenneté sont inadéquats puisqu'ils n'expriment pas une compréhension des questions soulevées par la preuve, encore moins des préoccupations que l'agent de la citoyenneté a portées à l'attention du juge de la citoyenneté. Ainsi, ces motifs ne permettent pas à la partie responsable de l'examen de comprendre pourquoi le juge de la citoyenneté a pris sa décision. Je ne suis pas d'accord, et je trouve au contraire que les motifs du juge de la citoyenneté étaient adéquats.\n[37]\nLe droit applicable a grandement évolué depuis l'époque où l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a été prononcé en ce qui concerne le caractère adéquat des motifs d'une décision administrative, tant pour ce qui est du niveau de détail de l'analyse auquel devraient être assujetties les décisions reposant sur des faits, comme celle qui nous intéresse en l'espèce, que pour ce qui est du caractère suffisant des motifs en tant que raison justifiant à elle seule le contrôle judiciaire. Dans l'arrêt\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [\nNewfoundland Nurses\n], la Cour suprême du Canada a formulé des indications quant à la manière d'aborder les situations dans lesquelles le décideur fournit des motifs brefs ou limités. L'insuffisance alléguée des motifs ne constitue plus à elle seule un fondement pour accueillir une demande de contrôle judiciaire: les motifs n'ont pas à être exhaustifs ou parfaits ni à traiter de l'ensemble des éléments de preuve ou des arguments présentés par une partie ou figurant dans le dossier.\n[38]\nLe décideur n'est pas tenu de mentionner tous les détails qui étayent sa conclusion. Il suffit que les motifs permettent à la Cour de comprendre le fondement d'une décision et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables (\nNewfoundland Nurses\n, au paragraphe 16). Les motifs doivent être lus comme un tout, en corrélation avec le dossier, dans le but de décider s'ils offrent la justification, la transparence et l'intelligibilité requise d'une décision raisonnable (Dunsmuir, au paragraphe 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Dans la décision\nSafi\n, prononcée récemment, la Cour a analysé la question du caractère adéquat des motifs d'une décision du juge de la citoyenneté. Dans cette décision, la juge Kane a fait écho aux principes énoncés dans l'arrêt\nNewfoundland Nurses\net a fait observer que le décideur n'est pas tenu d'expliciter chaque motif, argument ou détail dans sa décision, ni de tirer une conclusion explicite sur chaque élément constitutif du raisonnement qui l'a mené à sa conclusion finale. Les motifs doivent  être examinés en corrélation avec le résultat et ils doivent permettre de savoir si ce dernier fait partie des issues possibles  (\nSafi\n, au paragraphe 17).\n[39]\nEn l'espèce, la décision du juge de la citoyenneté satisfait à ce critère; les motifs indiquent clairement pourquoi il a déterminé que M. Suleiman a satisfait à l'obligation de résidence et de quelle façon il a tenu compte de la preuve. Par conséquent, l'argument selon lequel les motifs du juge n'étaient pas suffisants n'est pas fondé. Le contrôle judiciaire porte sur la décision en soi, et non sur le processus décisionnel. Une cour de révision examine le dossier dans le but de confirmer la décision; lorsqu'elles sont manifestes, les lacunes de la preuve peuvent être comblées s'il est possible de le faire en s'appuyant sur la preuve, et des inférences logiques comprises dans le résultat peuvent être tirées (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Cela étant dit, je reconnais que l'arrêt\nNewfoundland Nurses\nne donne pas à la Cour toute la latitude voulue pour fournir des motifs qui n'ont pas été donnés ni ne l'autorise à deviner quelles conclusions auraient pu être tirées ou à émettre des hypothèses sur ce que le décideur a pu penser. Toutefois, ce n'est pas le cas en l'espèce; il s'agit plutôt d'une situation dans laquelle la cour de révision peut établir les liens et les distinctions qui s'imposent dans la décision du juge de la citoyenneté.\n[40]\nDans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire, il incombe au ministre de convaincre la Cour que son intervention est justifiée. Toutefois, il incombait à M. Suleiman de prouver qu'il satisfaisait à l'obligation de résidence, et le juge de la citoyenneté avait le devoir de fournir des motifs pour montrer comment il était arrivé à sa décision (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). C'est ce que le juge de la citoyenneté a fait.\n[41]\nLa norme applicable est celle de la décision raisonnable, et non celle de la décision parfaite. En matière de citoyenneté, les motifs de décision sont souvent très brefs et ne portent pas toujours sur toutes les divergences dans la preuve. Toutefois, même lorsque les motifs de la décision sont brefs ou mal rédigés, la Cour doit faire preuve de retenue à l'égard de l'appréciation de la preuve par le décideur et de ses décisions au sujet de la crédibilité, pourvu que la Cour soit en mesure de comprendre la décision du juge de la citoyenneté (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nThomas\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLee\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 25 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\n[42]\nDans la décision\nThomas\n, par exemple, le juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que la défenderesse était crédible et avait répondu aux préoccupations de l'agent de citoyenneté et a accepté les explications de la défenderesse. En réponse à l'argument du ministre selon lequel la preuve était insuffisante, le juge Mosley a indiqué que les notes auraient pu être plus claires et plus détaillées, mais que la décision finale reposait sur une appréciation raisonnable de la preuve, y compris des explications données par la défenderesse. Le juge Mosley a souligné qu'il n'y avait pas de lacunes inexpliquées dans la preuve puisque le défendeur a donné des explications que le juge de la citoyenneté a jugées crédibles. Le juge Mosley a rappelé que la Cour doit, en l'absence d'une erreur manifeste, faire montre de retenue à l'égard de l'appréciation de la preuve effectuée par le décideur et des conclusions de ce dernier relatives à la crédibilité (\nThomas\n, aux paragraphes 33 et 34).\n[43]\nIl faut établir une distinction entre les affaires dans lesquelles la Cour accepte d'intervenir et l'espèce. Dans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], l'agente de la citoyenneté a souligné quelques préoccupations, notamment un visa délivré à une date à laquelle la demanderesse prétendait se trouver au Canada, des relevés bancaires qui présentaient généralement de nombreuses transactions, mais qui présentaient des périodes sans activité alors que la demanderesse était supposée être au Canada, et des visites chez le médecin à des dates pendant lesquelles elle était supposée être en voyage. Le juge Boivin a conclu que la décision n'était pas raisonnable, car plusieurs lacunes dans la preuve n'avaient pas été traitées, et la Cour n'a pas été en mesure de comprendre le raisonnement du juge de la citoyenneté ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 28). Dans la décision\nSafi\n, la juge Kane a reconnu que certaines des lacunes non réglées n'étaient pas importantes et étaient probablement le résultat d'un simple malentendu, mais a ajouté que des éléments posaient problème et nécessitaient un examen plus poussé, notamment des timbres illisibles du passeport, certains voyages qui n'avaient pas été déclarés et un visa délivré sous un autre nom. La juge Kane a indiqué qu'il n'était pas possible de déterminer clairement de quelle manière le juge de la citoyenneté avait apprécié la preuve et que ce dernier avait semblé ignorer des éléments de preuve au dossier qui auraient dû l'inciter à fouiller davantage la question (\nSafi\n, aux paragraphes 44 et 45).\n[44]\nDans la décision\nCanada (Citoyenneté et Immigration\n)\nc Jeizan\n, 2010 CF 323, le juge de Montigny a conclu que le manquement au chapitre des jours de résidence était beaucoup plus important que ce qu'avait déterminé le juge de la citoyenneté et que la preuve documentaire limitée posait problème, en particulier puisque de nombreux reçus présentés pour prouver la présence de la demanderesse au Canada portaient des dates auxquelles, de son propre aveu, elle n'était pas présente au Canada. La Cour a également annulé les décisions d'un juge de la citoyenneté d'accorder la citoyenneté lorsqu'elle a constaté que le défendeur avait fait des fausses déclarations importantes (mettant souvent en cause de longues absences du Canada) dont le juge de la citoyenneté n'avait pas tenu compte dans sa décision (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[45]\nLa présente affaire est différente. Le juge de la citoyenneté a défini le critère de résidence qu'il a appliqué et a abordé les préoccupations de l'agent de la citoyenneté quant à la crédibilité; il n'y avait pas de lacunes dans la preuve ni de périodes qui n'ont pas été prises en compte. Je n'hésite aucunement à conclure que les motifs sont suffisants et adéquats en ce qui concerne le critère établi dans l'arrêt\nNewfoundland Nurses\n. La décision démontre clairement pourquoi le juge de la citoyenneté a approuvé la demande de M. Suleiman et a rejeté les préoccupations de l'agent de la citoyenneté.\nC.\nY a-t-il des raisons spéciales qui justifieraient l'adjudication de dépens en l'espèce?\n[46]\nMonsieur Suleiman demande l'adjudication de dépens, étant donné que la demande de contrôle judiciaire n'était pas fondée et qu'il s'est écoulé un délai démesuré de cinq ans avant que le juge de la citoyenneté se prononce sur sa demande de citoyenneté.\n[47]\nLa Cour n'adjuge habituellement pas de dépens dans les instances en matière d'immigration puisque l'article 22 des\nRègles des cours fédérales en matière d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/93-22, prévoit que  [s]auf ordonnance contraire rendue par un juge pour des raisons spéciales, la demande d'autorisation, la demande de contrôle judiciaire ou l'appel introduit en application des présentes règles ne donnent pas lieu à des dépens . Bien que chaque affaire présente des circonstances qui lui sont propres, le critère de l'existence de  raisons spéciales  est rigoureux (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En l'espèce, j'estime qu'il n'existe pas de raisons spéciales justifiant l'adjudication de dépens.\n[48]\nDans l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> la Cour d'appel fédérale a présenté un résumé détaillé des circonstances dans lesquelles la Cour reconnaît l'existence de [traduction]  circonstances particulières  justifiant l'adjudication de dépens. Selon cette décision, en fonction d'une analyse de la jurisprudence, des  raisons spéciales  justifiant que les dépens soient adjugés à l'encontre du ministre existent dans les circonstances suivantes:\n- Le ministre cause à un demandeur une perte considérable de temps et de ressources en adoptant des thèses incompatibles devant la Cour fédérale et la Cour d'appel fédérale;\n- Un agent d'immigration contourne une ordonnance de la Cour;\n- Un agent d'immigration adopte une conduite trompeuse ou abusive;\n- Un agent d'immigration rend une décision uniquement après un délai déraisonnable et injustifié;\n- Le ministre s'oppose de façon déraisonnable à une demande de contrôle judiciaire qui est manifestement valable en droit.\n[49]\nJe ne conclus pas que les circonstances en l'espèce sont semblables ou étroitement similaires aux situations qui justifient l'adjudication de dépens. Le fait que le ministre a choisi d'exercer son droit prévu par la loi de demander un contrôle judiciaire et que sa demande est rejetée ne permet pas de conclure à l'existence de raisons spéciales. De plus, je conviens avec le ministre que le délai de cinq ans entre la demande de M. Suleiman et la décision du juge de la citoyenneté ne constitue pas une raison justifiant l'adjudication de dépens, puisque M. Suleiman aurait pu demander l'aide de la Cour concernant tout préjudice qu'il aurait pu subir pendant ces cinq années, mais a choisi de ne pas le faire.\n[50]\nPar conséquent, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il existe en l'espèce des  raisons spéciales  justifiant l'adjudication des dépens, et je refuse de rendre pareille ordonnance.\nIV.\nConclusion\n[51]\nPour les motifs susmentionnés, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. S'il est vrai que le ministre aurait préféré une décision plus élaborée, le juge de la citoyenneté a néanmoins répondu à toutes les préoccupations soulevées par l'agent de la citoyenneté dans sa décision et a expliqué pourquoi ces préoccupations n'avaient pas d'incidence sur sa conclusion relativement à l'obligation de résidence. Sa décision est raisonnable, et les motifs présentés sont suffisants. Je n'estime pas que le juge de la citoyenneté a tiré des conclusions de fait déraisonnables ni qu'il a mal saisi les questions soulevées par l'agent de la citoyenneté. Le juge de la citoyenneté a plutôt réglé les préoccupations soulevées, d'abord en discutant de ces préoccupations avec M. Suleiman, puis en les expliquant dans sa décision.\nJUGEMENT\n[52]\nLA COUR STATUE\nque\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée sans frais.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Sharon McCartney\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0]\n..................................................\nI.\nOverview\n\n[1]\nGascon, J.\n: Mr. Suleiman entered Canada in July 2004 and became a permanent resident on that day. He applied for Canadian citizenship on April 1, 2009. As the citizenship officer reviewing his application was not satisfied that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirements during the relevant period of reference, Mr. Suleiman completed a residency questionnaire. In April 2014, after reviewing Mr. Suleiman's application, his residency questionnaire and other documents, the citizenship officer identified some concerns with Mr. Suleiman's file and with the credibility of his statements about his presence in Canada.\n\n[2]\nThe matter was thus referred to a citizenship judge who held a two and a half hour hearing with Mr. Suleiman in October 2014, where he questioned him and discussed the issues of concern regarding the number of days he resided in Canada. The citizenship judge concluded that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirements and, on October 20, 2014, he approved Mr. Suleiman's application for citizenship.\n\n[3]\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has applied for a judicial review of this decision of the citizenship judge on the basis that the judge made numerous erroneous factual findings and did not show a grasp of the concerns raised by the citizenship officer. The Minister also contends that the citizenship judge's reasons in support of his decision were inadequate and insufficient. In response, Mr. Suleiman submits that the citizenship judge's decision was reasonable, and that the factual errors identified by the Minister were immaterial to the decision. Mr. Suleiman is also seeking costs from the Minister.\n\n[4]\nThe outcome of this application for judicial review turns on the credibility assessments made by the citizenship judge on Mr. Suleiman's residence in Canada and on the sufficiency of his reasons. For the reasons that follow, the Minister's application for judicial review is dismissed. I am not convinced that the citizenship judge's decision is unreasonable or that the discrepancies singled out by the Minister were material to the judge's decision. I also find that the reasons for the decision adequately explain how the citizenship judge found that Mr. Suleiman had met the residency requirement. However, I agree with the Minister that there are no special reasons justifying an award of costs to Mr. Suleiman in this matter.\nII.\nBackground\n\n[5]\nIn his decision dated October 20, 2014, the citizenship judge found, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, RSC 1985 c 29 to obtain Canadian citizenship, as outlined in\nRe Pourghasemi\n(1993), 62 FTR 122, 19 Imm LR (2d) 259 (FCTD). This physical test of residence provides that the Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who, within the relevant four-year or 1460-day period of reference, has accumulated at least three years (or 1095 days) of residence in Canada.\n\n[6]\nThe citizenship judge identified the period of reference as being from April 1, 2005 to April 1, 2009, and noted that Mr. Suleiman had declared 1402 days of presence in Canada and 58 days of absence from Canada in that time frame.\n\n[7]\nAfter summarizing the procedural steps leading to his decision, including his review of the residency questionnaire and documents submitted by Mr. Suleiman and Mr. Suleiman's appearance at a hearing before him, the citizenship judge outlined the facts as he understood them. Specifically, the citizenship judge mentioned the following:\nMr. Suleiman's work experience of 20 years in Dubai with Ernst and Young and the termination of his employment there at the beginning of 2005;\nMr. Suleiman's arrival in Canada with his family in July 2004 and his trip back to Dubai approximately three months later to finalize his affairs in Dubai;\nMr. Suleiman's return to Canada in March 2005;\nThe fact that Mr. Suleiman left Canada only twice since March 2005 for short visits to Dubai to see his family;\nMr. Suleiman's residence with his cousin for about 7 months when he returned to Canada in 2005, and then in the apartment that his brother owned after his wife and children moved out of it, until 2010;\nMr. Suleiman's contentious divorce proceedings, finally disposed of in 2011.\n\n[8]\nThe citizenship judge then referred to the credibility concerns raised by the citizenship officer with regard to Mr. Suleiman's file, and cited:\nInconsistencies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the evidence from the court decision in his divorce proceedings regarding the termination of his employment in Dubai;\nThe absence of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport;\nA United Arab Emirates [UAE] stamp dated \"25 May 2005\", a date not declared by Mr. Suleiman;\nA UAE residence visa in Mr. Suleiman's passport for the entire period of reference;\nThe absence or scarcity of financial documents for 2005 and 2006;\nAn absence of evidence of mortgage, rent or utility payments during the period of reference.\n\n[9]\nThe citizenship judge reviewed each of the citizenship officer's concerns about Mr. Suleiman's file and discussed them in the decision. Specifically, the citizenship judge concluded that it was difficult to determine the extent of inconsistencies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the court decision on his divorce because the remarks in the divorce court order regarding Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai were \"very vague\".\n\n[10]\nThe citizenship judge found that the lack of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport could not lead to any conclusions as the Canadian Border Services Agency at Pearson Airport routinely did not stamp permanent residents' passports returning to Canada during that time period.\n\n[11]\nFurther to his examination of Mr. Suleiman's passport, the citizenship judge concluded that a \"May 25, 2006\" (not 2005) stamp was clearly visible, a date corresponding with an absence from Canada declared by Mr. Suleiman.\n\n[12]\nIn addressing the citizenship officer's concern that Mr. Suleiman's passport contained a UAE residence visa during the period of reference, the citizenship judge found that the visa did not cover the entire period, and noted that visas are routinely not cancelled when a person leaves Dubai while the visa is valid.\n\n[13]\nThe citizenship judge acknowledged the citizenship officer's concern regarding the lack of financial documents for 2005, the paucity of those for 2006 and the dearth of evidence regarding rent/mortgage or utility payments; however, he accepted Mr. Suleiman's explanation that he did not work in 2005, and that his income was small in 2006 as he only started working when his financial resources were depleted. The citizenship judge also noted Mr. Suleiman's explanation that his ex-wife had kept and destroyed most of his documents, and that he had not disclosed his divorce on his residency questionnaire because he was ashamed and the divorce had not been finalized until 2011.\n\n[14]\nThe citizenship judge found the documentation and explanations from Mr. Suleiman credible as they substantiated his claim that he resided in Canada during the time he had declared residence in the country. The citizenship judge further noted the absence of evidence that Mr. Suleiman had travelled outside Canada other than for his declared absences.\n\n[15]\nThe citizenship judge concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Suleiman had demonstrated that he had resided in Canada for a sufficient number of days to meet the residency requirement of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the\nCitizenship Act\n.\nIII.\nAnalysis\nA.\nWere the conclusions of the citizenship judge on Mr. Suleiman's residence in Canada unreasonable?\n\n[16]\nThe Minister alleges that the citizenship judge made a number of incorrect factual findings in his decision, sufficient to render his decision unreasonable. Mr. Suleiman replies that the citizenship judge had the opportunity to assess his credibility during a hearing which lasted over two and a half hours, and that the Minister has not produced a transcript of such hearing. In his decision, the citizenship judge found the explanations of Mr. Suleiman credible. Counsel for Mr. Suleiman acknowledged that there could be minor discrepancies between Mr. Suleiman's application and the residency questionnaire but contends that these have no material impact on the physical test of residence used by the citizenship judge, given that Mr. Suleiman exceeded the residence requirement by a significant margin of about 300 days.\n\n[17]\nI agree with Mr. Suleiman and am satisfied that the citizenship judge's findings were reasonable and that the minor discrepancies identified by the Minister were not material enough to render the decision unreasonable. The judge engaged in a thorough and detailed assessment of the evidence on Mr. Suleiman's presence in Canada. While the citizenship judge could perhaps have provided additional reasons to support certain findings, there is no fatal flaw to his reasoning and I am satisfied that he considered the totality of the evidence.\n\n[18]\nIt is well established that the standard of reasonableness applies to a review of a citizenship judge's decision in determining whether the residency requirement has been met (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[19]\nWhen reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis is concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. Findings involving questions of facts or mixed fact and law should not be disturbed provided that the decision \"falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In conducting a reasonableness review of factual findings, it is not the role of the Court to reweigh the evidence or the relative importance given by the immigration officer to any relevant factor ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Under a reasonableness standard, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency, and intelligibility, a reviewing court should not substitute its own view of a preferable outcome (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSafi\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[20]\nIt is also settled law that the courts owe significant deference to credibility findings made by boards and tribunals (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 4;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In particular, the credibility findings of citizenship judges deserve such deference because they are better situated to \"make the factual determination as to whether the threshold question of the existence of a residence has been established\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[21]\nThe Minister contends that the citizenship judge made several incorrect factual findings with respect to passport issues, discrepancies between Mr. Suleiman's residency questionnaire and the evidence in the divorce court order, and Mr. Suleiman's travels outside of Canada in 2004 and 2005.\n\n[22]\nThe Minister's arguments on these factual findings invite the Court to substitute its view of the evidence for that of the citizenship judge. The judge heard from Mr. Suleiman directly at the hearing and thoroughly reviewed the evidence before reaching the conclusion that Mr. Suleiman had resided the sufficient number of days in Canada in the period of reference. The Minister has not pointed to evidence that contradicts this finding. There is also no basis for an inference that the citizenship judge ignored material evidence that squarely contradicted his conclusions (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 3). A failure to mention an element of evidence does not mean that it was ignored or that there was a reviewable error. In this case, the judge has also had the benefit of a long hearing with Mr. Suleiman, for which there is no transcript to contradict the evidence on the record or the affidavit filed by Mr. Suleiman. The decision of the citizenship judge evidently took into account the oral evidence provided by Mr. Suleiman. A review of the decision shows that the judge found the following:\nMr. Suleiman terminated his employment in Dubai at the beginning of 2005 and returned to Canada in March 2005, after finalizing his affairs in Dubai;\nMr. Suleiman left Canada only twice since March 2005 for short visits to Dubai to see his family;\nMr. Suleiman had places of residence in Canada when he returned to Canada in 2005 and throughout the period of reference, first with his cousin and afterwards in an apartment owned by his brother;\nMr. Suleiman had not travelled outside of Canada other than for his declared absences;\nThere were satisfactory explanations for the absence of Canadian re-entry stamps on Mr. Suleiman's passport, the alleged \"25 May 2005\" stamp date and the UAE residence visa in Mr. Suleiman's passport.\n\n[23]\nA decision-maker such as a citizenship judge is deemed to have considered all the evidence in the file [\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CAF), in paragraph 3]. Failure to mention evidence does not mean that it was not considered or that a reviewable error was made. In this case, the judge also had the opportunity to hold a lengthy hearing with Mr. Suleiman, for which there is no transcript contradicting the evidence in the record or the affidavit filed by Mr. Suleiman. In his decision, the citizenship judge obviously took into consideration the oral testimony provided by Mr. Suleiman. A review of the decision reveals that the judge concluded the following:\nMr. Suleiman left his job in Dubai in early 2005 and returned to Canada in March 2005, after settling his affairs in Dubai;\nMr. Suleiman has only left Canada twice since March 2005 for short trips to Dubai to see his family;\nMr. Suleiman had places of residence in Canada when he returned to the country in 2005 and throughout the reference period, first with his cousin and then in an apartment belonging to his brother;\nMr. Suleiman had not traveled outside of Canada for purposes other than his declared absences;\nThere have been satisfactory explanations regarding the absence of Canadian entry stamps on Mr. Suleiman's passport, the purported stamp date of May 25, 2005, and the UAE residency visa in Mr. Suleiman's passport.\n\n[24]\nIn view of these elements, it was reasonable for the citizenship judge to conclude that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement. I further note that this is not a situation where Mr. Suleiman was close to the minimum number of days required to meet the physical test of residence; even with some minor discrepancies in the evidence relating to some travel dates, he was well above the 1095 day threshold.\n\n[25]\nI now turn to the more specific allegations made by the Minister. The Minister challenges the citizenship judge's statement that the remarks made in the divorce proceedings regarding Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai were \"very vague\". The divorce court order reported that Mr. Suleiman had indicated a termination of his employment in Dubai sometime in 2005 or 2006; since Mr. Suleiman had responded in his residency questionnaire that his employment in Dubai rather ended prior to his entry in Canada in July 2004, the Minister contends that Mr. Suleiman either provided inaccurate information in his residency questionnaire or in the divorce court proceedings. I do not find that the judge's conclusion on Mr. Suleiman's employment in Dubai is unreasonable. In his decision, the citizenship judge reports that, based on the evidence before him, Mr. Suleiman returned to Canada in March 2005 and terminated his employment in Dubai in early 2005; this does not contradict the divorce court order. Mr. Suleiman also points out that, in his affidavit (which was not contradicted), the citizenship judge did in fact question him about this specific issue during the hearing, and was satisfied with his response.\n\n[26]\nWhile the judge could arguably have elaborated further on the apparent discrepancy with the residency questionnaire, it does not make his decision on this point unreasonable. His finding is rather supported by evidence on the record. Furthermore, I agree with Mr. Suleiman that this alleged discrepancy is in any event peripheral and immaterial to the decision given that the termination of his employment in Dubai was before the period of reference ranging from April 2005 to April 2009.\n\n[27]\nThe Minister is right to point out that there remains at all times a positive obligation on the citizenship applicants to provide true, correct, and complete information and to refrain from making false declarations. This however does not mean that corroborative evidence is required on every single element. It is well recognized that the\nCitizenship Act\ndoes not require corroboration on all counts; instead, it is \"the responsibility of the original decision-maker, taking the context into consideration, to determine the extent and nature of the evidence required\" (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nEl Bousserghini\n]). The citizenship judge may not have reconciled the apparent discrepancy as clearly as the Minister would have liked to see it in his reasons, or explained in as much detail as the Minister would have hoped how Mr. Suleiman convinced the judge that the discrepancy did not harm his credibility. But there is nothing to indicate that the judge's finding on Mr. Suleiman's return to Canada prior to the beginning of the reference period was not reasonable.\n\n[28]\nThe Minister also submits that the citizenship judge made a factual error on Mr. Suleiman's travel dates to Dubai from October to December 2004, and from December 2004 or January 2005 to March 2005. I again note that these trips occurred before the period of reference and have no impact on the calculations for the residence requirements. Given that the citizenship judge had the benefit of the hearing with Mr. Suleiman, I find that the citizenship judge was entitled not to draw an adverse credibility finding out of such evidence.\n\n[29]\nThe Minister further contends that the citizenship judge made a factual error by stating that Mr. Suleiman only left Canada twice since his return in March 2005, whereas his citizenship application and residency questionnaire indicate that he had actually left Canada three times. Assuming there is a discrepancy, the evidence shows that, in the worst-case scenario, the difference adds up to some 14 days of absence from Canada (73 days as opposed to 59) out of the 1460 days considered for the residency period. I agree with counsel for Mr. Suleiman that such a minor difference is of no relevance, considering that the citizenship judge also concluded that all the trips of Mr. Suleiman outside of Canada had been declared. Once again, it was therefore not unreasonable for the citizenship judge not to refer to this extensively in his decision.\n\n[30]\nThis is not a situation where, as in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the exercise of discretion by the citizenship judge went too far and the judge accepted weak and unconceivable explanations on unreported absences with no further inquiries (at paras 23 and 30). In the present case, the citizenship judge reviewed these concerns with Mr. Suleiman at the hearing and concluded that Mr. Suleiman had met his onus to establish residence through sufficient and credible evidence. All of the alleged errors or discrepancies identified by the Minister relate to factual findings made by the citizenship judge after he had the opportunity to question the credibility of Mr. Suleiman at the hearing and after he was satisfied about it. Furthermore, they are discrepancies regarding events that occurred outside of the period of reference, and would not have affected the outcome of the residency requirement. The minor factual errors identified by the Minister are far from making the decision unreasonable and are not significant enough to warrant this Court's intervention.\n\n[31]\nAs this Court stated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  immaterial errors, even if there are several, are not sufficient to render a decision unreasonable. An imperfect decision with immaterial errors remains reasonable.\n\n[32]\nThe Minister also takes issue with the manner in which the citizenship judge weighed Mr. Suleiman's declarations against the objective evidence, submitting that the citizenship judge did not hold Mr. Suleiman to his evidentiary onus under the\nCitizenship Act\n. The Minister contends that Mr. Suleiman did not provide objective corroborative evidence to establish his residence in Canada between April 2005 and June 2006, and that this was unreasonable given the discrepancies in the evidence. The Minister submits that the lack of Canadian re-entry stamps and documentary evidence establishing residency in Canada is important because the citizenship judge failed to assess whether, in absence of such corroborative evidence, Mr. Suleiman was able to meet his evidentiary onus.\n\n[33]\nI do not agree with this reading of the decision. I rather conclude that the decision reflects that the citizenship judge turned his mind to those issues and addressed them. He found that the absence of Canadian re-entry stamps in Mr. Suleiman's passport could not lead to any conclusions given the Canada Border Services Agency's practice of not stamping permanent residents' passports returning to Canada during that period. He also reviewed and considered the paucity of financial documents for 2005 and 2006 and the lack of evidence regarding rent/mortgage or utility payments made by Mr. Suleiman, and accepted Mr. Suleiman's explanation about his unemployment in 2005, the depletion of his financial resources in 2006 and the destruction of documents by his ex-wife in the context of his divorce. It was certainly not unreasonable, in light of such evidence, for the citizenship judge to conclude that Mr. Suleiman met his onus of demonstrating residence in Canada in the period of reference. The citizenship judge found the documentation and explanations provided by Mr. Suleiman credible as they substantiated his claim that he resided in Canada during the time he had declared residence in the country.\n\n[34]\nThe Court understands the Minister's desire to receive more detailed or more complete reasons from a citizenship judge, as the process established by the\nCitizenship Act\nrequires a citizenship officer to refer a matter to a citizenship judge when the officer has concerns and is not satisfied that residency requirements are met. But the test this Court has to apply is not whether the decision satisfies the expectations of the Minister; the test is the reasonableness of the decision. None of the conclusions of the citizenship judge are outside the range of reasonableness. Where there might have been some alleged inconsistencies, they were either immaterial or could be reasonably reconciled within the decision.\n\n[35]\nI find the ultimate result reasonable considering the totality of the evidence and the applicable legal principles. The decision falls within a range of reasonable alternatives defensible in respect of the facts and the law, and this Court should not interfere with it on judicial review.\nB.\nWere the reasons provided by the citizenship judge in support of his decision sufficient and adequate?\n\n[36]\nThe Minister submits that the citizenship judge's reasons are inadequate in that they do not show a grasp of the issues raised by the evidence, let alone the concerns raised by the citizenship officer for the citizenship judge's consideration. As such, they do not allow a reviewing party to understand why the citizenship judge made his decision. I do not agree and rather find that the citizenship judge's reasons were adequate.\n\n[37]\nThe law relating to the sufficiency of reasons in administrative decision-making has evolved substantially since <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , both with respect to the degree of scrutiny to which fact-based decisions such as the decision at issue in this case should be subjected, and in relation to the sufficiency of reasons as a stand-alone ground for judicial review. In\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [\nNewfoundland Nurses\n], the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance on how to approach situations where decision-makers provide brief or limited reasons. An alleged insufficiency of reasons is no longer a stand-alone basis for granting judicial review: reasons need not be fulsome or perfect, and need not address all of the evidence or arguments put forward by a party or in the record.\n\n[38]\nThe decision-maker is not required to refer to each and every detail supporting his or her conclusion. It is sufficient if the reasons permit the Court to understand why the decision was made and determine whether the conclusion falls within the range of possible acceptable outcomes (\nNewfoundland Nurses\nat para 16). The reasons are to be read as a whole, in conjunction with the record, in order to determine whether the reasons provide the justification, transparency and intelligibility required of a reasonable decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This Court discussed the issue of adequacy of reasons in a citizenship judge's decision in the recent\nSafi\ndecision. In that decision, Justice Kane echoed the\nNewfoundland Nurses\nprinciples and stated that the decision-maker is not required to set out every reason, argument or detail in the reasons, or to make an explicit finding on each element that leads to the final conclusion. The reasons are to \"be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes\" (\nSafi\nat para 17).\n\n[39]\nIn this case, the citizenship judge's decision meets this standard; the reasons clearly explain why he decided that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirement and how he considered the evidence. Consequently, there is no merit to the argument that the judge's reasons were insufficient. The focus of judicial review remains on the outcome or decision itself, and not the process by which that outcome was reached. A reviewing court looks to the record with a view to upholding the decision; where readily apparent, evidentiary gaps may be filled in when supported by the evidence, and logical inferences implicit to the result may be drawn (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). That said, I acknowledge that\nNewfoundland Nurses\nis not an invitation to the Court to provide reasons that were not given, nor is it a licence to guess what findings might have been made or to speculate as to what a decision-maker might have been thinking. However, this is not the case here; rather, it is a situation where the reviewing court can connect the dots and draw the lines in the citizenship judge's decision.\n\n[40]\nIn this application for judicial review, it is the Minister's burden to persuade this Court that its intervention is warranted. However, it was Mr. Suleiman's duty to provide sufficient evidence that he met the residency requirement, and it was the citizenship judge's duty to provide reasons to show how he arrived at his decision (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is what the citizenship judge did.\n\n[41]\nReasonableness, not perfection, is the standard. In citizenship matters, reasons for decision are often very brief and do not always address all discrepancies in the evidence. However, even where the reasons for the decision are brief, or poorly written, this Court should defer to the decision-maker's weighing of the evidence and credibility determinations, as long as the Court is able to understand why the citizenship judge made its decision (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nThomas\n];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLee\n];\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\n\n[42]\nIn\nThomas\n, for example, the citizenship judge found that the respondent was credible, addressed the citizenship officer's concerns and accepted the respondent's explanations. In response to the Minister's argument that there was insufficient evidence, Justice Mosley noted that, although the notes could have been clearer and more thorough, the ultimate decision rested on a reasonable assessment of the evidence, including the explanations provided by the respondent. Justice Mosley pointed out that the case did not contain unexplained gaps in the evidence, as the respondent had provided explanations that the citizenship judge found credible. Justice Mosley reminded that the Court must defer to the decision-maker's weighing of the evidence and credibility determination in absence of clear error (\nThomas\nat paras 33-34).\n\n[43]\nCases where the Court agreed to intervene are distinguishable from the present one. In\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the citizenship officer had highlighted various concerns including a visa on a date where the applicant claimed to be in Canada, bank statements that were generally abundant but had periods of no activity when she was supposed to be in Canada, and doctor's visits on dates where she was supposed to be traveling. Justice Boivin found that the decision was not reasonable because these gaps in the evidence were not addressed, and the Court was unable to understand the citizenship judge's reasoning ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 28). In\nSafi\n, Justice Kane acknowledged that some of the unaddressed inadequacies were not important and likely the cause of a simple misunderstanding, but noted that there were problematic issues that required more careful scrutiny including illegible passport stamps, a failure to declare certain travel, and a visa issued in another name. Justice Kane found it was not clear how the citizenship judge weighed the evidence, and appeared to have ignored evidence which should have alerted him to probe further (\nSafi\nat paras 44-45).\n\n[44]\nIn\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration\n)\nv Jeizan\n, 2010 FC 323, Justice de Montigny found the extent of the short fall in days of residence to be much higher than what the citizenship judge had identified and the limited documentary proof to be problematic, particularly since numerous receipts provided to establish the applicant's presence in Canada were on dates she had admitted to not being present in the country. This Court has also quashed decisions of a citizenship judge to grant citizenship where it found the respondent had engaged in substantial misrepresentation (often involving substantial absences from Canada) that was not addressed by the citizenship judge's decision (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[45]\nThe present case is different. The citizenship judge identified the residency test he relied on and addressed the credibility concerns raised by the citizenship officer; there were no gaps in evidence or periods unaccounted for. I have no hesitation to conclude that the reasons are sufficient and adequate with regard to the test established by\nNewfoundland Nurses\n. It is clear from the decision why the citizenship judge approved Mr. Suleiman's application and dismissed the citizenship officer's concerns.\nC.\nAre there special reasons to award costs in this case?\n\n[46]\nMr. Suleiman asks for costs, given that the application for judicial review was ill-founded and there was an inordinate five-year delay before the citizenship judge adjudicated his citizenship application.\n\n[47]\nCosts are not ordinarily awarded in immigration proceedings in this Court, as Rule 22 of the\nFederal Courts\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22 provides that \"[n]o costs shall be awarded to or payable by any party in respect of an application for leave, an application for judicial review or an appeal under these Rules unless the Court, for special reasons, so orders.\" While each case turns on its own particular circumstances, the threshold for establishing the existence of \"special reasons\" is high (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In the circumstances of this case, I do not find that there are special reasons warranting an order of costs.\n\n[48]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Federal Court of Appeal provided a detailed summary of the circumstances in which the Court has recognized \"special circumstances\" meriting an award of costs. This decision observed that, based on an analysis of the jurisprudence, \"special reasons\" justifying an award of costs against the Minister have been found to exist where:\n- The Minister causes an applicant to suffer a significant waste of time and resources by taking inconsistent positions in the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal;\n- An immigration official circumvents an order of the Court;\n- An immigration official engages in conduct that is misleading or abusive;\n- An immigration official issues a decision only after an unreasonable and unjustified delay;\n- The Minister unreasonably opposes an obviously meritorious application for judicial review.\n\n[49]\nI do not find that the circumstances of this case are similar or close to those situations which have justified an order of costs. Special reasons do not arise merely because the Minister elected to exercise his statutory right to apply for judicial review of a decision and is not successful. Furthermore, I agree with the Minister that the five-year delay between Mr. Suleiman's application and the citizenship judge's decision does not amount to a sufficient reason for costs, as Mr. Suleiman could have sought the Court's assistance to deal with any prejudice he might have suffered during those five years, but elected not to do it.\n\n[50]\nI am therefore not persuaded that \"special reasons\" exist in this case that would justify an order of costs, and I decline to make such an order.\nIV.\nConclusion\n\n[51]\nFor the reasons set forth above, this application for judicial review is dismissed. Although the Minister might have preferred a more elaborate decision, the citizenship judge addressed all concerns that were raised by the citizenship officer in his decision and explained why they did not impact his finding on residence requirement. His decision was reasonable and provided adequate reasons. I do not find that there were unreasonable factual findings made by the citizenship judge or that the judge lacked a grasp of the issues raised by the citizenship officer. Instead, the citizenship judge addressed the concerns that were raised, first discussing them with Mr. Suleiman, and then explaining them in his decision.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[52]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthis application for judicial review is dismissed, without costs.\n.........................\nThe Minister of Citizenship and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Canada in July 2004 and became a permanent resident the same day. He applied for Canadian citizenship on April 1, 2009. Since the citizenship officer reviewing his application was not satisfied that Mr. Suleiman met the residency requirements during the reference period in question, Mr. Suleiman completed a residency questionnaire. In April 2014, after reviewing Mr. Suleiman's application, his residency questionnaire and other documents, the citizenship officer raised some concerns about Mr. Suleiman's file and the credibility of his statements about his presence in Canada.",
