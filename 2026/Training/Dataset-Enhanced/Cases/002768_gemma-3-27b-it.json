    "[1]\nMacKay, J.\n: In this action, the plaintiff seeks damages for injury and loss alleged to have been caused by the wrongful actions of certain officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, servants of Her Majesty, the defendant, in the course of their employment.",
    "[2]\nThe action is brought pursuant to the\nCrown Liability Act\n(now the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\n),  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  servant of the Crown, provided, in accord with s. 10, that the tort is one for which the servant would be personally liable. By reason of s. 36 (as amended by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 32, effective February 1, 1992), a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is specifically declared to be a servant of the Crown. Counsel for the defendant properly concedes that if the peace officers involved here committed a tort, they are clearly liable and the Crown is liable to answer for them.",
    "[3]\nTwo distinct causes of action are alleged, both arising from unfortunate events on April 21, 1987, when the plaintiff was arrested at her home after a brief scuffle with the officers. The first cause of action concerns injuries said to have been caused to the plaintiff when the arresting officers used excessive force, thus assaulting her and causing physical injuries which necessitated treatment and which have resulted in some impairment with long-term effects. Charges were laid against the plaintiff following her arrest, pursuant to s. 118(a) of the\nCriminal Code\n, that she wrongfully obstructed a police officer in the execution of his duty in executing a search warrant on the farm property occupied by the plaintiff and her husband east of Millet, Alberta. When those charges were tried in August 1987, the plaintiff was acquitted.",
    "[4]\nThe second cause of action concerns mental distress suffered and expenses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of an additional charge laid on June 26, 1987, against the plaintiff pursuant to s. 246(1)(b) of the\nCriminal Code\n, relating to the circumstances of her arrest on April 21, 1987, alleging that she unlawfully assaulted one of the police officers with intent to resist arrest. That charge, it is alleged, was wrongful, malicious and without reasonable and probable cause, and was initiated in retaliation for the plaintiff having made a complaint to the officer in charge of the R.C.M.P. detachment in which the arresting officers served, alleging assault by those officers. When the plaintiff appeared in provincial court in mid-September 1987, to answer to the second charge laid against her, the charge was withdrawn.",
    "[5]\nI propose to deal with the plaintiff's causes of action in turn in relation to liability and then to deal with the plaintiff's claims for damages.\nThe Alleged Assault\nUpon The Plaintiff",
    "[6]\nOn April 21, 1987, Mrs. Babyn, the plaintiff, then nearly 48 years of age, was at her rural farm home east of Millet, Alberta. There, her husband, with her assistance, operated a farm with some 30 head of cattle. It was a warm spring day and she worked in the garden on the south side of the house, away from the road, for an hour or so in the late morning, while her 2 year old grandson, who had been left at the farm by his mother, played nearby on a deck on the east side of the house. Around midday, she went in the house to prepare lunch, leaving her grandson on the deck with patio doors open between the deck and the kitchen/dining area of the house.",
    "[7]\nShe heard her grandson call and when she understood what he had said, she rushed outside through the open patio doors and across the deck to prevent him from going off to the fields to look for her youngest son who had earlier set off to hunt and shoot gophers. She caught up with the youngster at the rear of the house near the field extending beyond the house and a mobile home where Mrs. Babyn's grown daughter, Sharon, lived on the farm property with her parents. With the boy, she headed back to the house, coming around the trailer toward the yard or lawn that lies to the north side of the house between its back door and the main road. Her daughter came out of the mobile home and chatted briefly with Mrs. Babyn as they proceeded towards the house.",
    "[8]\nThen a number of police vehicles, including three marked R.C.M.P. vehicles with one or more unmarked cars, pulled up at the property. Two R.C.M.P. officers, in uniform, approached. One introduced the officers by name, asked if Mr. Edward Babyn, Mrs. Babyn's husband, was at home, to which she replied that she did not know where he was. The officer, then Constable Brooks, said that they were there to execute search warrants and he commenced reading one, a warrant to search the farm property, buildings and vehicles for drugs. He had a second warrant, to search the same property for stolen motor vehicle parts, which the police team was there to execute at the same time, but he did not have a chance to read or explain that one. Whether Brooks finished reading the first warrant is not entirely clear. Mrs. Babyn's evidence is that he did and that is supported by evidence of her daughter, but Brooks' evidence is that he did not. He did offer at some point to provide her with a copy of the warrant to which her response was negative. She and her daughter testified that she told Brooks to go ahead and search, but neither Brooks nor his fellow officer, then Corporal Huget, could recall that.",
    "[9]\nIn any event, either while Brooks was still reading, or had just completed reading, the first warrant, Mrs. Babyn, without any explanation, suddenly turned, hurried to the back door of the house, which was the door nearest the main roadway. She had met with Brooks at a point perhaps 30 feet from the door. When she reached the door which was ajar, Mrs. Babyn says she found boots behind the door, partly blocking access, and that she bent over to move the boots out of the way. She closed the door, solidly, as testified by the police officers, but she does not recall actually closing the door or why she did so, unless it was to remove the boots behind it or merely because of habit.",
    "[10]\nThe door she entered provides access to what I would call a porch, then by an open doorway on the left, access is provided to another small entryway which by another doorway to the right leads into the kitchen/dining area of the house. The kitchen area with refrigerator, stove and sink is at the far end and the dining area lies between the kitchen area and the entryway from the back door, to the left of the room in front of the open patio doors onto the deck outside. As one enters from the back door area, on the right is an open doorway to the livingroom.",
    "[11]\nMrs. Babyn's explanation for her sudden departure from the officers in the yard, which she did not at that time explain, is that she suddenly remembered that before leaving the house to catch her grandson, she had lit a cigarette and put it down, lighted, leaving it in an ashtray. She says that, worried her lighted cigarette might fall from the ashtray and cause a fire, she left the officers to ensure it had not done so. When she reached the kitchen/dining area, she found her cigarette still in the ashtray on the dining room table. She picked it up and then went to waken her husband whom she had noticed, as she moved to retrieve the cigarette, asleep on the couch just next to the open doorway in the livingroom. She told him the police were there. She then heard loud banging from the back door followed by footsteps running and, as she saw Corporal Huget enter the kitchen/dining area moving quickly, she moved, out of the path of his approach, toward the dining area near the table at the end near the back door and toward the side in front of the patio doors.",
    "[12]\nI digress from the main events. Mrs. Babyn testified that until she found her husband on the couch, she did not know he was at home, or where he was, because he had earlier planned to go to a neighbour's to assist with some work. When asked his whereabouts earlier by Brooks, she says that since she did not see the tractor in the yard area, she assumed her husband had set off as planned and had not yet returned. Only when she returned to the kitchen after leaving the policemen in the yard did she learn that he was at home and in the house.",
    "[13]\nThen Corporal Huget, now Staff Sergeant with the R.C.M.P., was in charge of the investigation in which the search warrants were issued and were to be executed. His testimony was that the investigation related to the Babyns' son, the father of the youngster whom Mrs. Babyn was looking after on the day in question, who had been arrested two days earlier after a high speed chase and an accident, and who had been found at that time to be in possession of drugs. The investigation of the son was in relation to activities in which he was believed to be involved, illegal trafficking in drugs and in stolen auto parts. The information available to the police was said to have come from informants to both the R.C.M.P. and Edmonton city police, and that information included a reported threat by the son to kill a police officer, probably an R.C.M.P. officer. Following the son's arrest, search warrants were obtained to search the properties and premises at some four locations where he was reported, or had admitted, he had been living recently. The search at the Babyn farm was the second in the same general vicinity in which the officers were engaged on April 21.",
    "[14]\nWhen Huget, accompanied by Brooks, walked into the yard at the Babyn's farm, he observed the area and farmhouse while Brooks spoke to Mrs. Babyn and her daughter, who were previously unknown to the officers. Huget heard such conversation as occurred without remembering the details, except that Brooks read the warrant to the women and had offered to provide a copy to Mrs. Babyn. He was very concerned when she appeared to be negative to that offer and suddenly hurried to the house, for this seemed to be out of keeping with the initial reception they had encountered from her. From his experience, he was concerned, though neither he nor Brooks said anything as she hurried away towards the house, that she might attempt to conceal or destroy evidence, or that she might be going into the house to get a firearm.",
    "[15]\nHuget's recollection is that the door nearest them, the back door to the house, was open, though he is uncertain about whether there was also a screen door which was closed, but he saw that, after she entered she closed the door, solidly. He testified that he observed her lock the door, but that was impossible with the door closed. Because of his concerns, he quickly followed Mrs. Babyn, moving to do so before she reached the door. On arriving at the closed door, he tried to open it without success, for though it did not appear stuck at the top or bottom, it was stuck at the latch. Mrs. Babyn denies that she locked the door; it was not their practice to do so. Her evidence, supported by that of her husband and her daughter, is that the latch mechanism of the door often stuck and that the doorknob had to be turned in one direction for the latch to release. Huget's evidence is that he turned the doorknob in both directions but the latch did not release and he believes it was locked. He kicked the door three times at the latch level, broke the door open and hurried into the house after Mrs. Babyn. He was followed closely by Brooks who saw Huget try to open the door and then kick it open.",
    "[16]\nHuget's testimony was clear that upon finding the door locked, he concluded Mrs. Babyn was obstructing the police officers in their execution of the search warrants and he then determined that she should be arrested and charged. When he entered the kitchen/dining area, he saw Mrs. Babyn to his left at the near end of the dining table towards the patio doors. He told her she was under arrest for obstruction, went quickly to Mrs. Babyn and took hold of her left arm above the wrist. He testified that she responded loudly, \"take your [profanity] hands off me\" and then she reached with the other hand to grab or hit him in the groin, yelling \"I'll fix you\".",
    "[17]\nBrooks, who had followed Huget into the kitchen/dining area, and had stopped in front of the livingroom door where Mr. Babyn was entering in order to deter him from getting involved, did not confirm that Mrs. Babyn so spoke and he did not see her reach out as Huget reports. Nor did her husband confirm Huget's evidence on this aspect. Mrs. Babyn herself claimed she had her cigarette in her right hand and merely reached out to put it back in the ashtray. No one else present noticed that she had a cigarette in her hand, and Huget's testimony was that she had nothing in her hands. She did ask \"What for?\" or \"What did I do?\" when she had been told by Huget that she was under arrest and he again said it was for obstruction.",
    "[18]\nHuget says that he then sought to restrain Mrs. Babyn by applying a wrist lock, a technique apparently rendered from the side of the person by bending the wrist backwards while holding the lower arm firmly. Mrs. Babyn's testimony is that Huget applied an armlock, bending her arm behind her back and pressing upward, causing pain that she sought to stop by bending over and moving away. Huget does not recall applying such a hold and the only time he could recall that her arms were behind her back was when she was later handcuffed. Mrs. Babyn claims that in the scuffle, her head was bumped into the wall and on the table, and that after reaching unsuccessfully to put her cigarette in the ashtray, she lost the cigarette and then used her free hand to try to protect her head. As she sought to get free of the painful armlock as she says, or as she fought to break free as Huget believed, she claims she asked what she was arrested for, but got no answer other than for obstruction.",
    "[19]\nAs they scuffled, dining table and chairs were disturbed and a side unit holding plants was knocked over. The scuffle must have been noisy, for the noise of yelling and shifting furniture carried out the open patio doors and the back door to the daughter, Sharon, and to a police car some 50 feet or more from the house, where Constable Moritz had been preparing paperwork to account for anything found in the search. Moritz had first heard the noise of Huget breaking in the back door and was able to see through a window that a scuffle had started. He left his car and rushed into the house, where he observed Huget with the still struggling Mrs. Babyn at the far end of the dining table and Brooks standing to block Mr. Babyn from entering the fray. Moritz moved swiftly to take Mrs. Babyn's free right arm and restrain her. When Mrs. Babyn called for help from her husband, Moritz ordered him not to get involved. Suddenly, Mrs. Babyn, Huget and Moritz ended up on the floor, Mrs. Babyn on the bottom, face down. Moritz held her thus while Huget handcuffed her wrists behind her back.",
    "[20]\nThe two officers, each holding one of her upper arms, then helped her to her knees, lifted her to her feet and proceeded to take her, one holding each arm, to a police vehicle where she was placed in the rear seat. She says they virtually carried her by the arms, hardly letting her feet hit the floor or the ground, causing her considerable pain. Outside, she says that she said to her daughter, who confirms it, that they were hurting her. Huget and Moritz both testified that she was continuing to resist, dragging her feet and that she said nothing to her daughter about them hurting her.",
    "[21]\nOnce in the vehicle, which had a plexiglass screen between front and back seats -- she says it prevented her from hearing the officers in the front seat, but they say it could not do so -- Huget advised her of the charge to be laid for her arrest, that she could call a lawyer, and further, that if she would calm down, be cooperative and provide her name, address and date of birth for identification purposes, he would consider issuing a promise to appear and not take her away from the farm. She would say nothing to the officers. Huget then called his detachment at Leduc for an officer to come to remove her from the farm.",
    "[22]\nShe was permitted to talk to her daughter about caring for her grandson before leaving about 30 minutes later in the police car which had been called. She was taken to Leduc, but because no matron was there on duty that day, she was then taken on to the R.C.M.P. detachment at Devon where a matron was present. At Devon, apparently after she was booked in, the handcuffs were removed and she was detained, but later that day, was released on a promise to appear when any charge was to be heard.",
    "[23]\nFrom this incident, Mrs. Babyn claims to have suffered physical injuries which are discussed in relation to her claim for damages for assault. The day after the incident, she sought treatment from a chiropractor who had provided assistance to her previously, and his evidence supports her claim of physical injuries. Assuming for the moment that these arose from the efforts of the officers to restrain her, were the officers liable for assault by excessive use of force?",
    "[24]\nFor the plaintiff, it was submitted that on the evidence, there was no reasonable and probable cause to arrest Mrs. Babyn, but even if there were, the officers used excessive force and wrongfully assaulted her.",
    "[25]\nWhile it is true that Mrs. Babyn was acquitted when tried for the offence of obstructing the peace officers, that in itself is not a basis for concluding there was no reasonable and probable cause for her arrest. In my view, it was not unreasonable for Corporal Huget to conclude, having observed Mrs. Babyn depart in haste without explanation, enter the open door and close so that it appeared to be locked and would not open when he tried it, that she was acting to obstruct the officers in their execution of the search warrant which specifically authorized search of the dwelling house. In the circumstances known to Huget and in light of his observations at the time, his decision in my view cannot be found to be unreasonable.",
    "[26]\nUnder then s. 450(1)(a) and (b), now s. 495(1)(a) and (b) of the\nCriminal Code\n, a peace officer is authorized to arrest without warrant a person whom he believes on reasonable and probable grounds has committed, is committing or is about to commit a criminal offence. It is, of course, a criminal offence under then s. 118(a) -- now s. 129(a) -- of the\nCriminal Code\n, to wilfully obstruct a peace officer in the execution of his duty. An arrest may be lawful even though the person arrested is subsequently acquitted of an offence charged, for it is the circumstances apparent to the officer at the time of the arrest that determine the validity of the arrest. In this case, I find that the circumstances at the time were such that the arrest of Mrs. Babyn cannot be found to be unlawful (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.)), and that she was informed at the time by Huget of the charge for which she was arrested.",
    "[27]\nI am, however, satisfied that the officers used excessive force in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn. I reach that conclusion for the following reasons:\n(1) The necessity for the officers to control the situation did not require the use of force. When Huget entered the kitchen/dining area and saw Mrs. Babyn to his left, while he saw her moving and did not know for what purpose, his evidence is that she had nothing in her hands. He was not then, or later, concerned about her attempting to escape or about his ability with his officers, to maintain control of the situation. His concerns earlier, when outside she had hurriedly departed for the house, that she might seek to destroy evidence or obtain a weapon were matters well within his observation of her activities in the kitchen/dining area and which he was then in a position to thwart if necessary.\n(2) The argument by the defendant that the officers only used such force as was necessary to restrain Mrs. Babyn's resistance to her arrest only has merit, if one concedes that the use of force in physically restraining her was necessary in the first place, whether by a wristlock as Huget says he attempted to apply, or by an armlock hold behind her back as Mrs. Babyn says was applied. I do not so concede. The evidence, in my view, does not support a conclusion that physical force was necessary at all to effect the arrest of Mrs. Babyn. Her arrest simply required that her freedom be restrained. In my view, there could be no doubt that this was a matter within control of the officers without the use of physical force. She explains her resistance to the use of force in her arrest by saying that after he arm was seized, she was trying to avoid the pain caused by the use of physical force and to protect herself. At first, she had pulled away from Huget because she did not understand why she was arrested. When told she was under arrest for obstruction, she had asked what for, not sharing any sense of Huget's conclusion that she had locked the door, for she is convinced she did not do so.\n(3) In a physical sense, even without the use of force, the officers dominated the situation and the use of force was unnecessary to maintain control. Huget, a senior officer with more than 25 years' service, is nearly six feet tall and weighs 170 pounds. Moritz, who arrived late on the scene and moved quickly to restrain Mrs. Babyn, had some 12 years of service at that time. He is six feet two inches tall and weighs 195 pounds. Mrs. Babyn is five feet one inch tall and weighs, then and now, about 135 pounds.",
    "[28]\nOne is tempted to say res ipsa loquitor. Perhaps Mr. Babyn aptly described the situation, with understatement, in two comments made in the course of his testimony. When asked what he did when his wife ended up on the floor with two police officers, he said (Transcript, vol. I, p. 171):\n\"Well, at that point, I made a step to move in and settle this thing out. To my way of thinking, it was getting a little ridiculous [...]\"",
    "[29]\nWhen asked at a later point how he felt about what happened in the kitchen that day, he said (Transcript, vol. I, p. 177):\n\"Well, it was -- at the time, I just woke up and all this happened in a matter of, you know, seconds almost. I was originally shocked. I couldn't believe it was happening, you know.\n\"I figured, you know, I didn't know what transpired outside before they came in. I was, you know, when it takes two big police officers to physically arrest a slightly small, middle-aged lady, you know, it makes you wonder.\"",
    "[30]\nPolice officers have a very difficult role in modern society. I appreciate that it is not made easier by review of their actions with the benefit of hindsight taking account of factors perhaps not fully understood at the time. Nevertheless, as officers trained in the use of force, their responsibilities are very great in the exercise of judgment about when force is necessary and what may be appropriate in the circumstances. Decisions made in the heat of the moment, if excessive force results, are not protected by s. 25(1) of the\nCriminal Code\n.",
    "[31]\nMoreover, in the circumstances of this case, where physical force was unnecessary to effect the arrest, any significant use of force is excessive and it constitutes an assault upon the person physically restrained by the use of force.\nThe Alleged Malicious Prosecution",
    "[32]\nFollowing her arrest and release on April 21, Mr. Babyn filed a complaint, alleging assault by the officers involved in her arrest, with the officer-in-charge of their detachment at Leduc. That charge was investigated in the normal course of dealing by the Force with complaints about the conduct of its members. The result of that complaint, if known at the time of trial, was not in evidence and is, in any event, irrelevant to these proceedings.",
    "[33]\nAs earlier noted, in June a second charge was laid against Mrs. Babyn, that on April 21 she unlawfully assaulted Corporal Huget with intent to resist her arrest or detention, contrary to s. 246(1) of the\nCriminal Code\n. Subsequently, that charge was not prosecuted, though it was not withdrawn until she appeared at court in response to a summons in September. The process resulted in her incurring $250 costs for her lawyer's services in preparation and in appearing with her in relation to the charge. She claims damages for injury to her reputation, for inconvenience and the expense incurred.",
    "[34]\nThis claim is based on alleged malicious prosecution, without reasonable and probable cause. The claim arises in substantial part because of the sequence of the arrest and original charge for obstruction of a peace officer, Mrs. Babyn's complaint to the R.C.M.P. about the conduct of the officers involved in her arrest, and the subsequent charge of assault in resisting arrest.",
    "[35]\nTo establish the requirements of tort of malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must satisfy four elements. These are described by A.M. Linden in\nCanadian Tort Law\n(5th Ed., Butterworths, 1993, Toronto, at p. 49):\n\"The tort of malicious prosecution, though closely related to false imprisonment, is somewhat different, requiring the presence of four elements. First, criminal proceedings must have been instituted by the defendant against the plaintiff; second, those proceedings must have been concluded favourably to the plaintiff; third, there must have been a lack of reasonable and probable cause for the defendant's conduct, and fourth, there must have been an improper purpose underlying the defendant's conduct, not an honest belief in guilt.\"",
    "[36]\nI am satisfied on the evidence of the officers, Huget, Brooks and Moritz, that there was no conspiracy on their part, as the plaintiff alleged, to initiate the second charge. All professed not to be concerned about Mrs. Babyn's complaint to the Force.",
    "[37]\nHuget's evidence was that the practice followed in relation to the laying of charges at their detachment in Alberta is that all charges initially laid by arresting officers are reviewed, before the initial appearance date, by the provincial Crown prosecutor who ultimately determines on the basis of the police reports whether those charges are to be pursued or dropped and whether any additional charges should be laid. The general practice in Alberta as described by Huget was supported by the testimony of Brooks and Moritz.",
    "[38]\nIn this case, the Crown prosecutor, after reviewing the reports, had instructed that the second charge against Mrs. Babyn be laid, and it would have been the prosecutor who subsequently decided that it be withdrawn without prosecution. Apparently, the decision to withdraw the second charge was made before the date fixed for its hearing, for none of the officers involved appeared for the hearing. It is unfortunate that Mrs. Babyn and her lawyer were not informed until they appeared, but any fault in neglecting to advise her, in the circumstances of this case, was not that of the police officers involved, but was that of the prosecutor's office.",
    "[39]\nI conclude that the elements of the tort of malicious prosecution are not established in this case. I add that no evidence of loss was adduced in relation to this alleged wrong, except the expense incurred by Mrs. Babyn for her lawyer's fees. Since there was no wrong, in relation to the second charge laid, for which the defendant's servants were liable, there is no ground to consider compensating her for that expense.\nDamages Claimed",
    "[40]\nI have found that the police officers involved in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn used excessive force. In so doing, they assaulted Mrs. Babyn. I conclude that the physical injuries suffered by Mrs. Babyn were caused directly by that assault. For the defendant, it is pleaded that any damages or injuries she suffered were caused or contributed to by the plaintiff in obstructing and resisting Her Majesty's peace officers. Since the obstruction of the officers in execution of their duties was identified by Huget as her closing and, he believed, her locking the back door after she entered, it was not that incident that resulted in injury to her. Her injury arose only from the physical force applied in arresting her. There is no doubt she struggled when Huget sought to physically restrain her, but I accept Mrs. Babyn's testimony that she did not understand what she had done to warrant the effort to physically restrain her, and further, that she was seeking to avoid the pain, from the armhold applied to her, by bending and pulling away. Since I have concluded that in the circumstances there was no necessity for Huget to physically restrain her, I do not find that her efforts to avoid the pain of his grasp caused or contributed to her injuries.",
    "[41]\nThe struggle lasted a very brief time. I have no doubt that all involved, in retrospect, regret that it happened at all and that it ended as it did. While one cannot predict how anyone seized by the arm by a police officer will react, in circumstances where the person does not understand the reason for being seized, asks for a reason and is told simply that they are under arrest for obstruction, the manner of their reaction in the very short term does not, in my view, provide a defence or even a basis for a finding of contributory negligence if the officers' action were deemed to be negligent.",
    "[42]\nIt is implicit in the defence offered that Mrs. Babyn should have meekly submitted to Huget's use of force. In my view, the situation was entirely within his control and that of his colleagues. That control would not have been threatened by his restraint from any use of force, or once he had taken Mrs. Babyn's arm and found her resisting, to have simply released her. In the circumstances of this case, that would have been an equally effective way to end the scuffle as expecting Mrs. Babyn to do nothing to try to avoid physical restraint and pain which was unnecessary.",
    "[43]\nThere was no evidence to counter that of Mrs. Babyn that as a result of the manner of her arrest, she suffered pain, mainly in her back, shoulders and arms. On the day after her arrest, she went to a Doctor of Chiropractic, Dr. Sindelar, in Wetaskiwin, who had treated her previously for back problems. In his opinion, the injuries he found were caused by the physical actions of the officers in arresting her, as those actions were described to him by the plaintiff, and based also on his understanding of arrest techniques employed by the police in Alberta. While I am not prepared to accept his knowledge of police techniques as a proper basis for his assigning cause for the injuries, there is no evidence, explanation or theory offered at trial to suggest these injuries arose from any other event than the physical force used in effecting Mrs. Babyn's arrest.",
    "[44]\nI note for the record that Dr. Sindelar filed an affidavit and was accepted, after questioning but without objection, as an expert witness in chiropractic, in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal dysfunction, and with special expertise in Ju-Jitsu and self-defence techniques.",
    "[45]\nDr. Sindelar had treated Mrs. Babyn previously for back problems in 1984 and 1986, but that condition had been alleviated and she had not had treatment for about a year when she came to see him on April 22, 1987. His initial examination that day revealed swelling and tenderness in the muscles along the entire spine, in the pectoral muscles, evidence of pain and weakness in upper body muscles, restricted and stiff movement from the hips upward, particularly in the lower back, neck and both shoulders. His diagnosis was an acute traumatic spinal and shoulder injury resulting in subluxations (or small dislocations) of the 5th cervical, 1st and 5th thoracic, and 3rd and 5th lumbar vertebrae, with paravertebral muscular strain, along with a bilateral shoulder sprain. Her earlier condition in the right sacroiliac region was re-aggravated.",
    "[46]\nMrs. Babyn continued treatment by Dr. Sindelar following her initial visit in April 1987, once a week for a time and thereafter twice monthly, and she was still seeing him on a regular basis at the time of the trial. In July 1992, he had reexamined her to assess her condition at that time. Some muscles in the lumbar and mid-thoracic area were sore and tender, and there was restricted motion throughout the entire spine, and weakness in a number of muscles. His diagnosis at that time confirmed subluxations of the 5th thoracic and 5th lumbar vertebrae, causing arthritic and degenerative change in the thoracic spine and right sacroiliac joint. It is Dr. Sindelar's opinion that since the original diagnosis on April 22, 1987, arthritic and degenerative changes had accelerated beyond the norm that would be expected for someone of Mrs. Babyn's age.",
    "[47]\nThe doctor's prognosis, at the time of his affidavit sworn in January 1993, was poor, and he expected Mrs. Babyn to be bothered periodically for the rest of her life due to the arthritic and degenerative changes in the cervical and thoracic spine.",
    "[48]\nMrs. Babyn's evidence is that she continues to suffer discomfort, occasional pain and back problems if she undertakes strenuous work. She has little strength in her arms and is unable to lift, for example, her grandchildren. She is not able to do heavy work in the garden as she once did. She spoke of inability to undertake physical work in the farming operation, with reference to her previous work when the Babyns operated a dairy farm. Since they no longer do so, having switched to raising beef cattle in 1986 as Mr. Babyn testified, I take Mrs. Babyn's references to work on the dairy farm as illustrations of physical work she once did but is no longer able to do because of the injury to her back as a result of the assault on April 21, 1987. Mr. Babyn's evidence generally supported his wife's more limited physical activity since the incident.",
    "[49]\nI turn to the plaintiff's claims for damages. She seeks, in relation to the two causes of action pleaded, special damages, general damages of $50,000 and exemplary or punitive damages of $10,000. I consider only those heads of damages as they are related to the assault, not as they might be affected by the claim for malicious prosecution which I have found is not established.",
    "[50]\nSpecial damages are claimed, and are awarded, in the amount of $2,308.78. Of that total, $1,092.50 is for costs incurred for the plaintiff's share of fees for services rendered by Dr. Sindelar and not recoverable under the public health program in Alberta. The balance, $1,216.28, is for the cost of transportation, at reasonable rates, for vehicle operation in travel from the Babyns' home to Dr. Sindelar's office in Wetaskawin.",
    "[51]\nCounsel for the plaintiff made reference to Goldsmith's Damage Tables in relation to awards of general damages in other cases involving spinal injuries below the neck. None of the examples were Alberta cases, all were cases decided from 1981 to 1989, mainly in the early to mid-1980's. General damage awards for physical injury to the back ranged from $10,000 to $65,000, the highest award being in a case of more serious injury, involving two fusions, some resulting drug addition and some permanent partial disability.",
    "[52]\nIn my view, in light of the prognosis for Mrs. Babyn's condition, that she is likely to be bothered for the rest of her life with accelerated arthritic and degenerative conditions, and in light of the restrictive changes her injury has caused in her lifestyle, the appropriate award of general damages in this case is $25,000. I include in this figure a measure for aggravated damages reflecting my conclusion that in the circumstances of this case, the use of physical force in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn and the extent to which that force was used was unnecessary. There is no doubt in my mind that she suffered loss of dignity as a result of the use of force in her arrest in the kitchen of her own home, in circumstances where it ought to have been evident to the officers concerned, even as events rapidly unfolded, that she presented no threat to them or to their control of the situation.",
    "[53]\nThe plaintiff claims exemplary or punitive damages. In my view, the circumstances of this case do not warrant any such award. There is no evidence of malicious conduct, or intentional, high-handed and abusive conduct found by my colleague Mr. Justice Cullen in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), or by my colleague Mr. Justice Muldoon in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . On appeal of the latter case, Mr. Justice MacGuigan, for the Court of Appeal, discussed punitive damages and their award against the Crown (see\nHer Majesty the Queen in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 193; [1989] 4 W.W.R. 218; 36 B.C.L.R.(2d) 273; 90 C.L.L.C. 14,035; 25 C.C.E.L. 81, where Mr. Justice McIntyre for the majority of the Supreme Court said:\n\"Moreover, punitive damages may only be awarded in respect of conduct which is of such a nature as to be deserving of punishment because of its harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious nature. I do not suggest that I have exhausted the adjectives which could describe the conduct capable of characterizing a punitive award, but in any case, where such an award is made, the conduct must be extreme in its nature and such that by any reasonable standard, it is deserving of full condemnation and punishment.\"",
    "[54]\nThe conduct of the officers involved in Mrs. Babyn's arrest involved errors of judgment in circumstances that developed quickly, but it did not constitute action that was vindictive, or malicious, or deserving of punishment. Having found aggravated general damages are warranted, I need hardly say that the conduct of the officers is disapproved of and not to be encouraged or condoned, even if it does not warrant punitive damages.\nConclusion",
    "[55]\nAs counsel for the plaintiff noted at trial, this action was originally initiated against the three R.C.M.P. officers -- Huget, Brooks and Moritz -- as well as the defendant, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Subsequently, by notice of discontinuance filed April 23, 1990, the action was wholly discontinued against the three named officers. No order to vary the style of cause in the action has since been made, and ex proprio motu this court by order included in the judgment filed with these reasons, directs that the style of cause now include only Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as defendant in the action.",
    "[56]\nI have concluded that the R.C.M.P. officers used excessive force in effecting the arrest of the plaintiff and thus assaulted her, which caused her expense and personal injury, with resulting impairment and discomfort expected to continue for her lifetime. It is acknowledged, on behalf of the defendant, that the officers were acting in the course of their duties as servants of Her Majesty. The defendant is thus liable in damages pursuant to the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\nin relation to the claim by the plaintiff. For reasons outlined, those damages are fixed by judgment filed with these reasons, as follows:\nFor special damages - $ 2,308.78\nFor general damages - $25,000.00",
    "[57]\nThe award of damages is subject to post-judgment interest in accord with s. 31.1 of the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\nas amended.",
    "[58]\nThe plaintiff's claims for damages for alleged malicious prosecution and for punitive damages are not established and are not allowed.",
    "[59]\nThe plaintiff asked for costs, and at trial counsel submitted that these be on a solicitor and client basis, but no argument was addressed, and I see no ground for finding the sort of conduct in relation to preparations for and proceedings in this action which would warrant costs on that basis. The plaintiff is, however, entitled to recover costs on the usual party and party basis and the judgment filed herein so provides.\nJudgment for plaintiff.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/sms\n[End of document]"

  "full_text": "[1]\nMacKay, J.\n: In this action, the plaintiff seeks damages for injury and loss alleged to have been caused by the wrongful actions of certain officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, servants of Her Majesty, the defendant, in the course of their employment.\n[2]\nThe action is brought pursuant to the\nCrown Liability Act\n(now the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\n),  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  servant of the Crown, provided, in accord with s. 10, that the tort is one for which the servant would be personally liable. By reason of s. 36 (as amended by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 32, effective February 1, 1992), a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is specifically declared to be a servant of the Crown. Counsel for the defendant properly concedes that if the peace officers involved here committed a tort, they are clearly liable and the Crown is liable to answer for them.\n[3]\nTwo distinct causes of action are alleged, both arising from unfortunate events on April 21, 1987, when the plaintiff was arrested at her home after a brief scuffle with the officers. The first cause of action concerns injuries said to have been caused to the plaintiff when the arresting officers used excessive force, thus assaulting her and causing physical injuries which necessitated treatment and which have resulted in some impairment with long-term effects. Charges were laid against the plaintiff following her arrest, pursuant to s. 118(a) of the\nCriminal Code\n, that she wrongfully obstructed a police officer in the execution of his duty in executing a search warrant on the farm property occupied by the plaintiff and her husband east of Millet, Alberta. When those charges were tried in August 1987, the plaintiff was acquitted.\n[4]\nThe second cause of action concerns mental distress suffered and expenses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of an additional charge laid on June 26, 1987, against the plaintiff pursuant to s. 246(1)(b) of the\nCriminal Code\n, relating to the circumstances of her arrest on April 21, 1987, alleging that she unlawfully assaulted one of the police officers with intent to resist arrest. That charge, it is alleged, was wrongful, malicious and without reasonable and probable cause, and was initiated in retaliation for the plaintiff having made a complaint to the officer in charge of the R.C.M.P. detachment in which the arresting officers served, alleging assault by those officers. When the plaintiff appeared in provincial court in mid-September 1987, to answer to the second charge laid against her, the charge was withdrawn.\n[5]\nI propose to deal with the plaintiff's causes of action in turn in relation to liability and then to deal with the plaintiff's claims for damages.\nThe Alleged Assault\nUpon The Plaintiff\n[6]\nOn April 21, 1987, Mrs. Babyn, the plaintiff, then nearly 48 years of age, was at her rural farm home east of Millet, Alberta. There, her husband, with her assistance, operated a farm with some 30 head of cattle. It was a warm spring day and she worked in the garden on the south side of the house, away from the road, for an hour or so in the late morning, while her 2 year old grandson, who had been left at the farm by his mother, played nearby on a deck on the east side of the house. Around midday, she went in the house to prepare lunch, leaving her grandson on the deck with patio doors open between the deck and the kitchen/dining area of the house.\n[7]\nShe heard her grandson call and when she understood what he had said, she rushed outside through the open patio doors and across the deck to prevent him from going off to the fields to look for her youngest son who had earlier set off to hunt and shoot gophers. She caught up with the youngster at the rear of the house near the field extending beyond the house and a mobile home where Mrs. Babyn's grown daughter, Sharon, lived on the farm property with her parents. With the boy, she headed back to the house, coming around the trailer toward the yard or lawn that lies to the north side of the house between its back door and the main road. Her daughter came out of the mobile home and chatted briefly with Mrs. Babyn as they proceeded towards the house.\n[8]\nThen a number of police vehicles, including three marked R.C.M.P. vehicles with one or more unmarked cars, pulled up at the property. Two R.C.M.P. officers, in uniform, approached. One introduced the officers by name, asked if Mr. Edward Babyn, Mrs. Babyn's husband, was at home, to which she replied that she did not know where he was. The officer, then Constable Brooks, said that they were there to execute search warrants and he commenced reading one, a warrant to search the farm property, buildings and vehicles for drugs. He had a second warrant, to search the same property for stolen motor vehicle parts, which the police team was there to execute at the same time, but he did not have a chance to read or explain that one. Whether Brooks finished reading the first warrant is not entirely clear. Mrs. Babyn's evidence is that he did and that is supported by evidence of her daughter, but Brooks' evidence is that he did not. He did offer at some point to provide her with a copy of the warrant to which her response was negative. She and her daughter testified that she told Brooks to go ahead and search, but neither Brooks nor his fellow officer, then Corporal Huget, could recall that.\n[9]\nIn any event, either while Brooks was still reading, or had just completed reading, the first warrant, Mrs. Babyn, without any explanation, suddenly turned, hurried to the back door of the house, which was the door nearest the main roadway. She had met with Brooks at a point perhaps 30 feet from the door. When she reached the door which was ajar, Mrs. Babyn says she found boots behind the door, partly blocking access, and that she bent over to move the boots out of the way. She closed the door, solidly, as testified by the police officers, but she does not recall actually closing the door or why she did so, unless it was to remove the boots behind it or merely because of habit.\n[10]\nThe door she entered provides access to what I would call a porch, then by an open doorway on the left, access is provided to another small entryway which by another doorway to the right leads into the kitchen/dining area of the house. The kitchen area with refrigerator, stove and sink is at the far end and the dining area lies between the kitchen area and the entryway from the back door, to the left of the room in front of the open patio doors onto the deck outside. As one enters from the back door area, on the right is an open doorway to the livingroom.\n[11]\nMrs. Babyn's explanation for her sudden departure from the officers in the yard, which she did not at that time explain, is that she suddenly remembered that before leaving the house to catch her grandson, she had lit a cigarette and put it down, lighted, leaving it in an ashtray. She says that, worried her lighted cigarette might fall from the ashtray and cause a fire, she left the officers to ensure it had not done so. When she reached the kitchen/dining area, she found her cigarette still in the ashtray on the dining room table. She picked it up and then went to waken her husband whom she had noticed, as she moved to retrieve the cigarette, asleep on the couch just next to the open doorway in the livingroom. She told him the police were there. She then heard loud banging from the back door followed by footsteps running and, as she saw Corporal Huget enter the kitchen/dining area moving quickly, she moved, out of the path of his approach, toward the dining area near the table at the end near the back door and toward the side in front of the patio doors.\n[12]\nI digress from the main events. Mrs. Babyn testified that until she found her husband on the couch, she did not know he was at home, or where he was, because he had earlier planned to go to a neighbour's to assist with some work. When asked his whereabouts earlier by Brooks, she says that since she did not see the tractor in the yard area, she assumed her husband had set off as planned and had not yet returned. Only when she returned to the kitchen after leaving the policemen in the yard did she learn that he was at home and in the house.\n[13]\nThen Corporal Huget, now Staff Sergeant with the R.C.M.P., was in charge of the investigation in which the search warrants were issued and were to be executed. His testimony was that the investigation related to the Babyns' son, the father of the youngster whom Mrs. Babyn was looking after on the day in question, who had been arrested two days earlier after a high speed chase and an accident, and who had been found at that time to be in possession of drugs. The investigation of the son was in relation to activities in which he was believed to be involved, illegal trafficking in drugs and in stolen auto parts. The information available to the police was said to have come from informants to both the R.C.M.P. and Edmonton city police, and that information included a reported threat by the son to kill a police officer, probably an R.C.M.P. officer. Following the son's arrest, search warrants were obtained to search the properties and premises at some four locations where he was reported, or had admitted, he had been living recently. The search at the Babyn farm was the second in the same general vicinity in which the officers were engaged on April 21.\n[14]\nWhen Huget, accompanied by Brooks, walked into the yard at the Babyn's farm, he observed the area and farmhouse while Brooks spoke to Mrs. Babyn and her daughter, who were previously unknown to the officers. Huget heard such conversation as occurred without remembering the details, except that Brooks read the warrant to the women and had offered to provide a copy to Mrs. Babyn. He was very concerned when she appeared to be negative to that offer and suddenly hurried to the house, for this seemed to be out of keeping with the initial reception they had encountered from her. From his experience, he was concerned, though neither he nor Brooks said anything as she hurried away towards the house, that she might attempt to conceal or destroy evidence, or that she might be going into the house to get a firearm.\n[15]\nHuget's recollection is that the door nearest them, the back door to the house, was open, though he is uncertain about whether there was also a screen door which was closed, but he saw that, after she entered she closed the door, solidly. He testified that he observed her lock the door, but that was impossible with the door closed. Because of his concerns, he quickly followed Mrs. Babyn, moving to do so before she reached the door. On arriving at the closed door, he tried to open it without success, for though it did not appear stuck at the top or bottom, it was stuck at the latch. Mrs. Babyn denies that she locked the door; it was not their practice to do so. Her evidence, supported by that of her husband and her daughter, is that the latch mechanism of the door often stuck and that the doorknob had to be turned in one direction for the latch to release. Huget's evidence is that he turned the doorknob in both directions but the latch did not release and he believes it was locked. He kicked the door three times at the latch level, broke the door open and hurried into the house after Mrs. Babyn. He was followed closely by Brooks who saw Huget try to open the door and then kick it open.\n[16]\nHuget's testimony was clear that upon finding the door locked, he concluded Mrs. Babyn was obstructing the police officers in their execution of the search warrants and he then determined that she should be arrested and charged. When he entered the kitchen/dining area, he saw Mrs. Babyn to his left at the near end of the dining table towards the patio doors. He told her she was under arrest for obstruction, went quickly to Mrs. Babyn and took hold of her left arm above the wrist. He testified that she responded loudly, \"take your [profanity] hands off me\" and then she reached with the other hand to grab or hit him in the groin, yelling \"I'll fix you\".\n[17]\nBrooks, who had followed Huget into the kitchen/dining area, and had stopped in front of the livingroom door where Mr. Babyn was entering in order to deter him from getting involved, did not confirm that Mrs. Babyn so spoke and he did not see her reach out as Huget reports. Nor did her husband confirm Huget's evidence on this aspect. Mrs. Babyn herself claimed she had her cigarette in her right hand and merely reached out to put it back in the ashtray. No one else present noticed that she had a cigarette in her hand, and Huget's testimony was that she had nothing in her hands. She did ask \"What for?\" or \"What did I do?\" when she had been told by Huget that she was under arrest and he again said it was for obstruction.\n[18]\nHuget says that he then sought to restrain Mrs. Babyn by applying a wrist lock, a technique apparently rendered from the side of the person by bending the wrist backwards while holding the lower arm firmly. Mrs. Babyn's testimony is that Huget applied an armlock, bending her arm behind her back and pressing upward, causing pain that she sought to stop by bending over and moving away. Huget does not recall applying such a hold and the only time he could recall that her arms were behind her back was when she was later handcuffed. Mrs. Babyn claims that in the scuffle, her head was bumped into the wall and on the table, and that after reaching unsuccessfully to put her cigarette in the ashtray, she lost the cigarette and then used her free hand to try to protect her head. As she sought to get free of the painful armlock as she says, or as she fought to break free as Huget believed, she claims she asked what she was arrested for, but got no answer other than for obstruction.\n[19]\nAs they scuffled, dining table and chairs were disturbed and a side unit holding plants was knocked over. The scuffle must have been noisy, for the noise of yelling and shifting furniture carried out the open patio doors and the back door to the daughter, Sharon, and to a police car some 50 feet or more from the house, where Constable Moritz had been preparing paperwork to account for anything found in the search. Moritz had first heard the noise of Huget breaking in the back door and was able to see through a window that a scuffle had started. He left his car and rushed into the house, where he observed Huget with the still struggling Mrs. Babyn at the far end of the dining table and Brooks standing to block Mr. Babyn from entering the fray. Moritz moved swiftly to take Mrs. Babyn's free right arm and restrain her. When Mrs. Babyn called for help from her husband, Moritz ordered him not to get involved. Suddenly, Mrs. Babyn, Huget and Moritz ended up on the floor, Mrs. Babyn on the bottom, face down. Moritz held her thus while Huget handcuffed her wrists behind her back.\n[20]\nThe two officers, each holding one of her upper arms, then helped her to her knees, lifted her to her feet and proceeded to take her, one holding each arm, to a police vehicle where she was placed in the rear seat. She says they virtually carried her by the arms, hardly letting her feet hit the floor or the ground, causing her considerable pain. Outside, she says that she said to her daughter, who confirms it, that they were hurting her. Huget and Moritz both testified that she was continuing to resist, dragging her feet and that she said nothing to her daughter about them hurting her.\n[21]\nOnce in the vehicle, which had a plexiglass screen between front and back seats -- she says it prevented her from hearing the officers in the front seat, but they say it could not do so -- Huget advised her of the charge to be laid for her arrest, that she could call a lawyer, and further, that if she would calm down, be cooperative and provide her name, address and date of birth for identification purposes, he would consider issuing a promise to appear and not take her away from the farm. She would say nothing to the officers. Huget then called his detachment at Leduc for an officer to come to remove her from the farm.\n[22]\nShe was permitted to talk to her daughter about caring for her grandson before leaving about 30 minutes later in the police car which had been called. She was taken to Leduc, but because no matron was there on duty that day, she was then taken on to the R.C.M.P. detachment at Devon where a matron was present. At Devon, apparently after she was booked in, the handcuffs were removed and she was detained, but later that day, was released on a promise to appear when any charge was to be heard.\n[23]\nFrom this incident, Mrs. Babyn claims to have suffered physical injuries which are discussed in relation to her claim for damages for assault. The day after the incident, she sought treatment from a chiropractor who had provided assistance to her previously, and his evidence supports her claim of physical injuries. Assuming for the moment that these arose from the efforts of the officers to restrain her, were the officers liable for assault by excessive use of force?\n[24]\nFor the plaintiff, it was submitted that on the evidence, there was no reasonable and probable cause to arrest Mrs. Babyn, but even if there were, the officers used excessive force and wrongfully assaulted her.\n[25]\nWhile it is true that Mrs. Babyn was acquitted when tried for the offence of obstructing the peace officers, that in itself is not a basis for concluding there was no reasonable and probable cause for her arrest. In my view, it was not unreasonable for Corporal Huget to conclude, having observed Mrs. Babyn depart in haste without explanation, enter the open door and close so that it appeared to be locked and would not open when he tried it, that she was acting to obstruct the officers in their execution of the search warrant which specifically authorized search of the dwelling house. In the circumstances known to Huget and in light of his observations at the time, his decision in my view cannot be found to be unreasonable.\n[26]\nUnder then s. 450(1)(a) and (b), now s. 495(1)(a) and (b) of the\nCriminal Code\n, a peace officer is authorized to arrest without warrant a person whom he believes on reasonable and probable grounds has committed, is committing or is about to commit a criminal offence. It is, of course, a criminal offence under then s. 118(a) -- now s. 129(a) -- of the\nCriminal Code\n, to wilfully obstruct a peace officer in the execution of his duty. An arrest may be lawful even though the person arrested is subsequently acquitted of an offence charged, for it is the circumstances apparent to the officer at the time of the arrest that determine the validity of the arrest. In this case, I find that the circumstances at the time were such that the arrest of Mrs. Babyn cannot be found to be unlawful (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.)), and that she was informed at the time by Huget of the charge for which she was arrested.\n[27]\nI am, however, satisfied that the officers used excessive force in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn. I reach that conclusion for the following reasons:\n(1) The necessity for the officers to control the situation did not require the use of force. When Huget entered the kitchen/dining area and saw Mrs. Babyn to his left, while he saw her moving and did not know for what purpose, his evidence is that she had nothing in her hands. He was not then, or later, concerned about her attempting to escape or about his ability with his officers, to maintain control of the situation. His concerns earlier, when outside she had hurriedly departed for the house, that she might seek to destroy evidence or obtain a weapon were matters well within his observation of her activities in the kitchen/dining area and which he was then in a position to thwart if necessary.\n(2) The argument by the defendant that the officers only used such force as was necessary to restrain Mrs. Babyn's resistance to her arrest only has merit, if one concedes that the use of force in physically restraining her was necessary in the first place, whether by a wristlock as Huget says he attempted to apply, or by an armlock hold behind her back as Mrs. Babyn says was applied. I do not so concede. The evidence, in my view, does not support a conclusion that physical force was necessary at all to effect the arrest of Mrs. Babyn. Her arrest simply required that her freedom be restrained. In my view, there could be no doubt that this was a matter within control of the officers without the use of physical force. She explains her resistance to the use of force in her arrest by saying that after he arm was seized, she was trying to avoid the pain caused by the use of physical force and to protect herself. At first, she had pulled away from Huget because she did not understand why she was arrested. When told she was under arrest for obstruction, she had asked what for, not sharing any sense of Huget's conclusion that she had locked the door, for she is convinced she did not do so.\n(3) In a physical sense, even without the use of force, the officers dominated the situation and the use of force was unnecessary to maintain control. Huget, a senior officer with more than 25 years' service, is nearly six feet tall and weighs 170 pounds. Moritz, who arrived late on the scene and moved quickly to restrain Mrs. Babyn, had some 12 years of service at that time. He is six feet two inches tall and weighs 195 pounds. Mrs. Babyn is five feet one inch tall and weighs, then and now, about 135 pounds.\n[28]\nOne is tempted to say res ipsa loquitor. Perhaps Mr. Babyn aptly described the situation, with understatement, in two comments made in the course of his testimony. When asked what he did when his wife ended up on the floor with two police officers, he said (Transcript, vol. I, p. 171):\n\"Well, at that point, I made a step to move in and settle this thing out. To my way of thinking, it was getting a little ridiculous [...]\"\n[29]\nWhen asked at a later point how he felt about what happened in the kitchen that day, he said (Transcript, vol. I, p. 177):\n\"Well, it was -- at the time, I just woke up and all this happened in a matter of, you know, seconds almost. I was originally shocked. I couldn't believe it was happening, you know.\n\"I figured, you know, I didn't know what transpired outside before they came in. I was, you know, when it takes two big police officers to physically arrest a slightly small, middle-aged lady, you know, it makes you wonder.\"\n[30]\nPolice officers have a very difficult role in modern society. I appreciate that it is not made easier by review of their actions with the benefit of hindsight taking account of factors perhaps not fully understood at the time. Nevertheless, as officers trained in the use of force, their responsibilities are very great in the exercise of judgment about when force is necessary and what may be appropriate in the circumstances. Decisions made in the heat of the moment, if excessive force results, are not protected by s. 25(1) of the\nCriminal Code\n.\n[31]\nMoreover, in the circumstances of this case, where physical force was unnecessary to effect the arrest, any significant use of force is excessive and it constitutes an assault upon the person physically restrained by the use of force.\nThe Alleged Malicious Prosecution\n[32]\nFollowing her arrest and release on April 21, Mr. Babyn filed a complaint, alleging assault by the officers involved in her arrest, with the officer-in-charge of their detachment at Leduc. That charge was investigated in the normal course of dealing by the Force with complaints about the conduct of its members. The result of that complaint, if known at the time of trial, was not in evidence and is, in any event, irrelevant to these proceedings.\n[33]\nAs earlier noted, in June a second charge was laid against Mrs. Babyn, that on April 21 she unlawfully assaulted Corporal Huget with intent to resist her arrest or detention, contrary to s. 246(1) of the\nCriminal Code\n. Subsequently, that charge was not prosecuted, though it was not withdrawn until she appeared at court in response to a summons in September. The process resulted in her incurring $250 costs for her lawyer's services in preparation and in appearing with her in relation to the charge. She claims damages for injury to her reputation, for inconvenience and the expense incurred.\n[34]\nThis claim is based on alleged malicious prosecution, without reasonable and probable cause. The claim arises in substantial part because of the sequence of the arrest and original charge for obstruction of a peace officer, Mrs. Babyn's complaint to the R.C.M.P. about the conduct of the officers involved in her arrest, and the subsequent charge of assault in resisting arrest.\n[35]\nTo establish the requirements of tort of malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must satisfy four elements. These are described by A.M. Linden in\nCanadian Tort Law\n(5th Ed., Butterworths, 1993, Toronto, at p. 49):\n\"The tort of malicious prosecution, though closely related to false imprisonment, is somewhat different, requiring the presence of four elements. First, criminal proceedings must have been instituted by the defendant against the plaintiff; second, those proceedings must have been concluded favourably to the plaintiff; third, there must have been a lack of reasonable and probable cause for the defendant's conduct, and fourth, there must have been an improper purpose underlying the defendant's conduct, not an honest belief in guilt.\"\n[36]\nI am satisfied on the evidence of the officers, Huget, Brooks and Moritz, that there was no conspiracy on their part, as the plaintiff alleged, to initiate the second charge. All professed not to be concerned about Mrs. Babyn's complaint to the Force.\n[37]\nHuget's evidence was that the practice followed in relation to the laying of charges at their detachment in Alberta is that all charges initially laid by arresting officers are reviewed, before the initial appearance date, by the provincial Crown prosecutor who ultimately determines on the basis of the police reports whether those charges are to be pursued or dropped and whether any additional charges should be laid. The general practice in Alberta as described by Huget was supported by the testimony of Brooks and Moritz.\n[38]\nIn this case, the Crown prosecutor, after reviewing the reports, had instructed that the second charge against Mrs. Babyn be laid, and it would have been the prosecutor who subsequently decided that it be withdrawn without prosecution. Apparently, the decision to withdraw the second charge was made before the date fixed for its hearing, for none of the officers involved appeared for the hearing. It is unfortunate that Mrs. Babyn and her lawyer were not informed until they appeared, but any fault in neglecting to advise her, in the circumstances of this case, was not that of the police officers involved, but was that of the prosecutor's office.\n[39]\nI conclude that the elements of the tort of malicious prosecution are not established in this case. I add that no evidence of loss was adduced in relation to this alleged wrong, except the expense incurred by Mrs. Babyn for her lawyer's fees. Since there was no wrong, in relation to the second charge laid, for which the defendant's servants were liable, there is no ground to consider compensating her for that expense.\nDamages Claimed\n[40]\nI have found that the police officers involved in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn used excessive force. In so doing, they assaulted Mrs. Babyn. I conclude that the physical injuries suffered by Mrs. Babyn were caused directly by that assault. For the defendant, it is pleaded that any damages or injuries she suffered were caused or contributed to by the plaintiff in obstructing and resisting Her Majesty's peace officers. Since the obstruction of the officers in execution of their duties was identified by Huget as her closing and, he believed, her locking the back door after she entered, it was not that incident that resulted in injury to her. Her injury arose only from the physical force applied in arresting her. There is no doubt she struggled when Huget sought to physically restrain her, but I accept Mrs. Babyn's testimony that she did not understand what she had done to warrant the effort to physically restrain her, and further, that she was seeking to avoid the pain, from the armhold applied to her, by bending and pulling away. Since I have concluded that in the circumstances there was no necessity for Huget to physically restrain her, I do not find that her efforts to avoid the pain of his grasp caused or contributed to her injuries.\n[41]\nThe struggle lasted a very brief time. I have no doubt that all involved, in retrospect, regret that it happened at all and that it ended as it did. While one cannot predict how anyone seized by the arm by a police officer will react, in circumstances where the person does not understand the reason for being seized, asks for a reason and is told simply that they are under arrest for obstruction, the manner of their reaction in the very short term does not, in my view, provide a defence or even a basis for a finding of contributory negligence if the officers' action were deemed to be negligent.\n[42]\nIt is implicit in the defence offered that Mrs. Babyn should have meekly submitted to Huget's use of force. In my view, the situation was entirely within his control and that of his colleagues. That control would not have been threatened by his restraint from any use of force, or once he had taken Mrs. Babyn's arm and found her resisting, to have simply released her. In the circumstances of this case, that would have been an equally effective way to end the scuffle as expecting Mrs. Babyn to do nothing to try to avoid physical restraint and pain which was unnecessary.\n[43]\nThere was no evidence to counter that of Mrs. Babyn that as a result of the manner of her arrest, she suffered pain, mainly in her back, shoulders and arms. On the day after her arrest, she went to a Doctor of Chiropractic, Dr. Sindelar, in Wetaskiwin, who had treated her previously for back problems. In his opinion, the injuries he found were caused by the physical actions of the officers in arresting her, as those actions were described to him by the plaintiff, and based also on his understanding of arrest techniques employed by the police in Alberta. While I am not prepared to accept his knowledge of police techniques as a proper basis for his assigning cause for the injuries, there is no evidence, explanation or theory offered at trial to suggest these injuries arose from any other event than the physical force used in effecting Mrs. Babyn's arrest.\n[44]\nI note for the record that Dr. Sindelar filed an affidavit and was accepted, after questioning but without objection, as an expert witness in chiropractic, in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal dysfunction, and with special expertise in Ju-Jitsu and self-defence techniques.\n[45]\nDr. Sindelar had treated Mrs. Babyn previously for back problems in 1984 and 1986, but that condition had been alleviated and she had not had treatment for about a year when she came to see him on April 22, 1987. His initial examination that day revealed swelling and tenderness in the muscles along the entire spine, in the pectoral muscles, evidence of pain and weakness in upper body muscles, restricted and stiff movement from the hips upward, particularly in the lower back, neck and both shoulders. His diagnosis was an acute traumatic spinal and shoulder injury resulting in subluxations (or small dislocations) of the 5th cervical, 1st and 5th thoracic, and 3rd and 5th lumbar vertebrae, with paravertebral muscular strain, along with a bilateral shoulder sprain. Her earlier condition in the right sacroiliac region was re-aggravated.\n[46]\nMrs. Babyn continued treatment by Dr. Sindelar following her initial visit in April 1987, once a week for a time and thereafter twice monthly, and she was still seeing him on a regular basis at the time of the trial. In July 1992, he had reexamined her to assess her condition at that time. Some muscles in the lumbar and mid-thoracic area were sore and tender, and there was restricted motion throughout the entire spine, and weakness in a number of muscles. His diagnosis at that time confirmed subluxations of the 5th thoracic and 5th lumbar vertebrae, causing arthritic and degenerative change in the thoracic spine and right sacroiliac joint. It is Dr. Sindelar's opinion that since the original diagnosis on April 22, 1987, arthritic and degenerative changes had accelerated beyond the norm that would be expected for someone of Mrs. Babyn's age.\n[47]\nThe doctor's prognosis, at the time of his affidavit sworn in January 1993, was poor, and he expected Mrs. Babyn to be bothered periodically for the rest of her life due to the arthritic and degenerative changes in the cervical and thoracic spine.\n[48]\nMrs. Babyn's evidence is that she continues to suffer discomfort, occasional pain and back problems if she undertakes strenuous work. She has little strength in her arms and is unable to lift, for example, her grandchildren. She is not able to do heavy work in the garden as she once did. She spoke of inability to undertake physical work in the farming operation, with reference to her previous work when the Babyns operated a dairy farm. Since they no longer do so, having switched to raising beef cattle in 1986 as Mr. Babyn testified, I take Mrs. Babyn's references to work on the dairy farm as illustrations of physical work she once did but is no longer able to do because of the injury to her back as a result of the assault on April 21, 1987. Mr. Babyn's evidence generally supported his wife's more limited physical activity since the incident.\n[49]\nI turn to the plaintiff's claims for damages. She seeks, in relation to the two causes of action pleaded, special damages, general damages of $50,000 and exemplary or punitive damages of $10,000. I consider only those heads of damages as they are related to the assault, not as they might be affected by the claim for malicious prosecution which I have found is not established.\n[50]\nSpecial damages are claimed, and are awarded, in the amount of $2,308.78. Of that total, $1,092.50 is for costs incurred for the plaintiff's share of fees for services rendered by Dr. Sindelar and not recoverable under the public health program in Alberta. The balance, $1,216.28, is for the cost of transportation, at reasonable rates, for vehicle operation in travel from the Babyns' home to Dr. Sindelar's office in Wetaskawin.\n[51]\nCounsel for the plaintiff made reference to Goldsmith's Damage Tables in relation to awards of general damages in other cases involving spinal injuries below the neck. None of the examples were Alberta cases, all were cases decided from 1981 to 1989, mainly in the early to mid-1980's. General damage awards for physical injury to the back ranged from $10,000 to $65,000, the highest award being in a case of more serious injury, involving two fusions, some resulting drug addition and some permanent partial disability.\n[52]\nIn my view, in light of the prognosis for Mrs. Babyn's condition, that she is likely to be bothered for the rest of her life with accelerated arthritic and degenerative conditions, and in light of the restrictive changes her injury has caused in her lifestyle, the appropriate award of general damages in this case is $25,000. I include in this figure a measure for aggravated damages reflecting my conclusion that in the circumstances of this case, the use of physical force in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn and the extent to which that force was used was unnecessary. There is no doubt in my mind that she suffered loss of dignity as a result of the use of force in her arrest in the kitchen of her own home, in circumstances where it ought to have been evident to the officers concerned, even as events rapidly unfolded, that she presented no threat to them or to their control of the situation.\n[53]\nThe plaintiff claims exemplary or punitive damages. In my view, the circumstances of this case do not warrant any such award. There is no evidence of malicious conduct, or intentional, high-handed and abusive conduct found by my colleague Mr. Justice Cullen in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), or by my colleague Mr. Justice Muldoon in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . On appeal of the latter case, Mr. Justice MacGuigan, for the Court of Appeal, discussed punitive damages and their award against the Crown (see\nHer Majesty the Queen in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 193; [1989] 4 W.W.R. 218; 36 B.C.L.R.(2d) 273; 90 C.L.L.C. 14,035; 25 C.C.E.L. 81, where Mr. Justice McIntyre for the majority of the Supreme Court said:\n\"Moreover, punitive damages may only be awarded in respect of conduct which is of such a nature as to be deserving of punishment because of its harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious nature. I do not suggest that I have exhausted the adjectives which could describe the conduct capable of characterizing a punitive award, but in any case, where such an award is made, the conduct must be extreme in its nature and such that by any reasonable standard, it is deserving of full condemnation and punishment.\"\n[54]\nThe conduct of the officers involved in Mrs. Babyn's arrest involved errors of judgment in circumstances that developed quickly, but it did not constitute action that was vindictive, or malicious, or deserving of punishment. Having found aggravated general damages are warranted, I need hardly say that the conduct of the officers is disapproved of and not to be encouraged or condoned, even if it does not warrant punitive damages.\nConclusion\n[55]\nAs counsel for the plaintiff noted at trial, this action was originally initiated against the three R.C.M.P. officers -- Huget, Brooks and Moritz -- as well as the defendant, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Subsequently, by notice of discontinuance filed April 23, 1990, the action was wholly discontinued against the three named officers. No order to vary the style of cause in the action has since been made, and ex proprio motu this court by order included in the judgment filed with these reasons, directs that the style of cause now include only Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as defendant in the action.\n[56]\nI have concluded that the R.C.M.P. officers used excessive force in effecting the arrest of the plaintiff and thus assaulted her, which caused her expense and personal injury, with resulting impairment and discomfort expected to continue for her lifetime. It is acknowledged, on behalf of the defendant, that the officers were acting in the course of their duties as servants of Her Majesty. The defendant is thus liable in damages pursuant to the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\nin relation to the claim by the plaintiff. For reasons outlined, those damages are fixed by judgment filed with these reasons, as follows:\nFor special damages - $ 2,308.78\nFor general damages - $25,000.00\n[57]\nThe award of damages is subject to post-judgment interest in accord with s. 31.1 of the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\nas amended.\n[58]\nThe plaintiff's claims for damages for alleged malicious prosecution and for punitive damages are not established and are not allowed.\n[59]\nThe plaintiff asked for costs, and at trial counsel submitted that these be on a solicitor and client basis, but no argument was addressed, and I see no ground for finding the sort of conduct in relation to preparations for and proceedings in this action which would warrant costs on that basis. The plaintiff is, however, entitled to recover costs on the usual party and party basis and the judgment filed herein so provides.\nJudgment for plaintiff.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/sms\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nMacKay, J.\n: In this action, the plaintiff seeks damages for injury and loss alleged to have been caused by the wrongful actions of certain officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, servants of Her Majesty, the defendant, in the course of their employment.\n\n[2]\nThe action is brought pursuant to the\nCrown Liability Act\n(now the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\n),  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  servant of the Crown, provided, in accord with s. 10, that the tort is one for which the servant would be personally liable. By reason of s. 36 (as amended by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 32, effective February 1, 1992), a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is specifically declared to be a servant of the Crown. Counsel for the defendant properly concedes that if the peace officers involved here committed a tort, they are clearly liable and the Crown is liable to answer for them.\n\n[3]\nTwo distinct causes of action are alleged, both arising from unfortunate events on April 21, 1987, when the plaintiff was arrested at her home after a brief scuffle with the officers. The first cause of action concerns injuries said to have been caused to the plaintiff when the arresting officers used excessive force, thus assaulting her and causing physical injuries which necessitated treatment and which have resulted in some impairment with long-term effects. Charges were laid against the plaintiff following her arrest, pursuant to s. 118(a) of the\nCriminal Code\n, that she wrongfully obstructed a police officer in the execution of his duty in executing a search warrant on the farm property occupied by the plaintiff and her husband east of Millet, Alberta. When those charges were tried in August 1987, the plaintiff was acquitted.\n\n[4]\nThe second cause of action concerns mental distress suffered and expenses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of an additional charge laid on June 26, 1987, against the plaintiff pursuant to s. 246(1)(b) of the\nCriminal Code\n, relating to the circumstances of her arrest on April 21, 1987, alleging that she unlawfully assaulted one of the police officers with intent to resist arrest. That charge, it is alleged, was wrongful, malicious and without reasonable and probable cause, and was initiated in retaliation for the plaintiff having made a complaint to the officer in charge of the R.C.M.P. detachment in which the arresting officers served, alleging assault by those officers. When the plaintiff appeared in provincial court in mid-September 1987, to answer to the second charge laid against her, the charge was withdrawn.\n\n[5]\nI propose to deal with the plaintiff's causes of action in turn in relation to liability and then to deal with the plaintiff's claims for damages.\nThe Alleged Assault\nUpon The Plaintiff\n\n[6]\nOn April 21, 1987, Mrs. Babyn, the plaintiff, then nearly 48 years of age, was at her rural farm home east of Millet, Alberta. There, her husband, with her assistance, operated a farm with some 30 head of cattle. It was a warm spring day and she worked in the garden on the south side of the house, away from the road, for an hour or so in the late morning, while her 2 year old grandson, who had been left at the farm by his mother, played nearby on a deck on the east side of the house. Around midday, she went in the house to prepare lunch, leaving her grandson on the deck with patio doors open between the deck and the kitchen/dining area of the house.\n\n[7]\nShe heard her grandson call and when she understood what he had said, she rushed outside through the open patio doors and across the deck to prevent him from going off to the fields to look for her youngest son who had earlier set off to hunt and shoot gophers. She caught up with the youngster at the rear of the house near the field extending beyond the house and a mobile home where Mrs. Babyn's grown daughter, Sharon, lived on the farm property with her parents. With the boy, she headed back to the house, coming around the trailer toward the yard or lawn that lies to the north side of the house between its back door and the main road. Her daughter came out of the mobile home and chatted briefly with Mrs. Babyn as they proceeded towards the house.\n\n[8]\nThen a number of police vehicles, including three marked R.C.M.P. vehicles with one or more unmarked cars, pulled up at the property. Two R.C.M.P. officers, in uniform, approached. One introduced the officers by name, asked if Mr. Edward Babyn, Mrs. Babyn's husband, was at home, to which she replied that she did not know where he was. The officer, then Constable Brooks, said that they were there to execute search warrants and he commenced reading one, a warrant to search the farm property, buildings and vehicles for drugs. He had a second warrant, to search the same property for stolen motor vehicle parts, which the police team was there to execute at the same time, but he did not have a chance to read or explain that one. Whether Brooks finished reading the first warrant is not entirely clear. Mrs. Babyn's evidence is that he did and that is supported by evidence of her daughter, but Brooks' evidence is that he did not. He did offer at some point to provide her with a copy of the warrant to which her response was negative. She and her daughter testified that she told Brooks to go ahead and search, but neither Brooks nor his fellow officer, then Corporal Huget, could recall that.\n\n[9]\nIn any event, either while Brooks was still reading, or had just completed reading, the first warrant, Mrs. Babyn, without any explanation, suddenly turned, hurried to the back door of the house, which was the door nearest the main roadway. She had met with Brooks at a point perhaps 30 feet from the door. When she reached the door which was ajar, Mrs. Babyn says she found boots behind the door, partly blocking access, and that she bent over to move the boots out of the way. She closed the door, solidly, as testified by the police officers, but she does not recall actually closing the door or why she did so, unless it was to remove the boots behind it or merely because of habit.\n\n[10]\nThe door she entered provides access to what I would call a porch, then by an open doorway on the left, access is provided to another small entryway which by another doorway to the right leads into the kitchen/dining area of the house. The kitchen area with refrigerator, stove and sink is at the far end and the dining area lies between the kitchen area and the entryway from the back door, to the left of the room in front of the open patio doors onto the deck outside. As one enters from the back door area, on the right is an open doorway to the livingroom.\n\n[11]\nMrs. Babyn's explanation for her sudden departure from the officers in the yard, which she did not at that time explain, is that she suddenly remembered that before leaving the house to catch her grandson, she had lit a cigarette and put it down, lighted, leaving it in an ashtray. She says that, worried her lighted cigarette might fall from the ashtray and cause a fire, she left the officers to ensure it had not done so. When she reached the kitchen/dining area, she found her cigarette still in the ashtray on the dining room table. She picked it up and then went to waken her husband whom she had noticed, as she moved to retrieve the cigarette, asleep on the couch just next to the open doorway in the livingroom. She told him the police were there. She then heard loud banging from the back door followed by footsteps running and, as she saw Corporal Huget enter the kitchen/dining area moving quickly, she moved, out of the path of his approach, toward the dining area near the table at the end near the back door and toward the side in front of the patio doors.\n\n[12]\nI digress from the main events. Mrs. Babyn testified that until she found her husband on the couch, she did not know he was at home, or where he was, because he had earlier planned to go to a neighbour's to assist with some work. When asked his whereabouts earlier by Brooks, she says that since she did not see the tractor in the yard area, she assumed her husband had set off as planned and had not yet returned. Only when she returned to the kitchen after leaving the policemen in the yard did she learn that he was at home and in the house.\n\n[13]\nThen Corporal Huget, now Staff Sergeant with the R.C.M.P., was in charge of the investigation in which the search warrants were issued and were to be executed. His testimony was that the investigation related to the Babyns' son, the father of the youngster whom Mrs. Babyn was looking after on the day in question, who had been arrested two days earlier after a high speed chase and an accident, and who had been found at that time to be in possession of drugs. The investigation of the son was in relation to activities in which he was believed to be involved, illegal trafficking in drugs and in stolen auto parts. The information available to the police was said to have come from informants to both the R.C.M.P. and Edmonton city police, and that information included a reported threat by the son to kill a police officer, probably an R.C.M.P. officer. Following the son's arrest, search warrants were obtained to search the properties and premises at some four locations where he was reported, or had admitted, he had been living recently. The search at the Babyn farm was the second in the same general vicinity in which the officers were engaged on April 21.\n\n[14]\nWhen Huget, accompanied by Brooks, walked into the yard at the Babyn's farm, he observed the area and farmhouse while Brooks spoke to Mrs. Babyn and her daughter, who were previously unknown to the officers. Huget heard such conversation as occurred without remembering the details, except that Brooks read the warrant to the women and had offered to provide a copy to Mrs. Babyn. He was very concerned when she appeared to be negative to that offer and suddenly hurried to the house, for this seemed to be out of keeping with the initial reception they had encountered from her. From his experience, he was concerned, though neither he nor Brooks said anything as she hurried away towards the house, that she might attempt to conceal or destroy evidence, or that she might be going into the house to get a firearm.\n\n[15]\nHuget's recollection is that the door nearest them, the back door to the house, was open, though he is uncertain about whether there was also a screen door which was closed, but he saw that, after she entered she closed the door, solidly. He testified that he observed her lock the door, but that was impossible with the door closed. Because of his concerns, he quickly followed Mrs. Babyn, moving to do so before she reached the door. On arriving at the closed door, he tried to open it without success, for though it did not appear stuck at the top or bottom, it was stuck at the latch. Mrs. Babyn denies that she locked the door; it was not their practice to do so. Her evidence, supported by that of her husband and her daughter, is that the latch mechanism of the door often stuck and that the doorknob had to be turned in one direction for the latch to release. Huget's evidence is that he turned the doorknob in both directions but the latch did not release and he believes it was locked. He kicked the door three times at the latch level, broke the door open and hurried into the house after Mrs. Babyn. He was followed closely by Brooks who saw Huget try to open the door and then kick it open.\n\n[16]\nHuget's testimony was clear that upon finding the door locked, he concluded Mrs. Babyn was obstructing the police officers in their execution of the search warrants and he then determined that she should be arrested and charged. When he entered the kitchen/dining area, he saw Mrs. Babyn to his left at the near end of the dining table towards the patio doors. He told her she was under arrest for obstruction, went quickly to Mrs. Babyn and took hold of her left arm above the wrist. He testified that she responded loudly, \"take your [profanity] hands off me\" and then she reached with the other hand to grab or hit him in the groin, yelling \"I'll fix you\".\n\n[17]\nBrooks, who had followed Huget into the kitchen/dining area, and had stopped in front of the livingroom door where Mr. Babyn was entering in order to deter him from getting involved, did not confirm that Mrs. Babyn so spoke and he did not see her reach out as Huget reports. Nor did her husband confirm Huget's evidence on this aspect. Mrs. Babyn herself claimed she had her cigarette in her right hand and merely reached out to put it back in the ashtray. No one else present noticed that she had a cigarette in her hand, and Huget's testimony was that she had nothing in her hands. She did ask \"What for?\" or \"What did I do?\" when she had been told by Huget that she was under arrest and he again said it was for obstruction.\n\n[18]\nHuget says that he then sought to restrain Mrs. Babyn by applying a wrist lock, a technique apparently rendered from the side of the person by bending the wrist backwards while holding the lower arm firmly. Mrs. Babyn's testimony is that Huget applied an armlock, bending her arm behind her back and pressing upward, causing pain that she sought to stop by bending over and moving away. Huget does not recall applying such a hold and the only time he could recall that her arms were behind her back was when she was later handcuffed. Mrs. Babyn claims that in the scuffle, her head was bumped into the wall and on the table, and that after reaching unsuccessfully to put her cigarette in the ashtray, she lost the cigarette and then used her free hand to try to protect her head. As she sought to get free of the painful armlock as she says, or as she fought to break free as Huget believed, she claims she asked what she was arrested for, but got no answer other than for obstruction.\n\n[19]\nAs they scuffled, dining table and chairs were disturbed and a side unit holding plants was knocked over. The scuffle must have been noisy, for the noise of yelling and shifting furniture carried out the open patio doors and the back door to the daughter, Sharon, and to a police car some 50 feet or more from the house, where Constable Moritz had been preparing paperwork to account for anything found in the search. Moritz had first heard the noise of Huget breaking in the back door and was able to see through a window that a scuffle had started. He left his car and rushed into the house, where he observed Huget with the still struggling Mrs. Babyn at the far end of the dining table and Brooks standing to block Mr. Babyn from entering the fray. Moritz moved swiftly to take Mrs. Babyn's free right arm and restrain her. When Mrs. Babyn called for help from her husband, Moritz ordered him not to get involved. Suddenly, Mrs. Babyn, Huget and Moritz ended up on the floor, Mrs. Babyn on the bottom, face down. Moritz held her thus while Huget handcuffed her wrists behind her back.\n\n[20]\nThe two officers, each holding one of her upper arms, then helped her to her knees, lifted her to her feet and proceeded to take her, one holding each arm, to a police vehicle where she was placed in the rear seat. She says they virtually carried her by the arms, hardly letting her feet hit the floor or the ground, causing her considerable pain. Outside, she says that she said to her daughter, who confirms it, that they were hurting her. Huget and Moritz both testified that she was continuing to resist, dragging her feet and that she said nothing to her daughter about them hurting her.\n\n[21]\nOnce in the vehicle, which had a plexiglass screen between front and back seats -- she says it prevented her from hearing the officers in the front seat, but they say it could not do so -- Huget advised her of the charge to be laid for her arrest, that she could call a lawyer, and further, that if she would calm down, be cooperative and provide her name, address and date of birth for identification purposes, he would consider issuing a promise to appear and not take her away from the farm. She would say nothing to the officers. Huget then called his detachment at Leduc for an officer to come to remove her from the farm.\n\n[22]\nShe was permitted to talk to her daughter about caring for her grandson before leaving about 30 minutes later in the police car which had been called. She was taken to Leduc, but because no matron was there on duty that day, she was then taken on to the R.C.M.P. detachment at Devon where a matron was present. At Devon, apparently after she was booked in, the handcuffs were removed and she was detained, but later that day, was released on a promise to appear when any charge was to be heard.\n\n[23]\nFrom this incident, Mrs. Babyn claims to have suffered physical injuries which are discussed in relation to her claim for damages for assault. The day after the incident, she sought treatment from a chiropractor who had provided assistance to her previously, and his evidence supports her claim of physical injuries. Assuming for the moment that these arose from the efforts of the officers to restrain her, were the officers liable for assault by excessive use of force?\n\n[24]\nFor the plaintiff, it was submitted that on the evidence, there was no reasonable and probable cause to arrest Mrs. Babyn, but even if there were, the officers used excessive force and wrongfully assaulted her.\n\n[25]\nWhile it is true that Mrs. Babyn was acquitted when tried for the offence of obstructing the peace officers, that in itself is not a basis for concluding there was no reasonable and probable cause for her arrest. In my view, it was not unreasonable for Corporal Huget to conclude, having observed Mrs. Babyn depart in haste without explanation, enter the open door and close so that it appeared to be locked and would not open when he tried it, that she was acting to obstruct the officers in their execution of the search warrant which specifically authorized search of the dwelling house. In the circumstances known to Huget and in light of his observations at the time, his decision in my view cannot be found to be unreasonable.\n\n[26]\nUnder then s. 450(1)(a) and (b), now s. 495(1)(a) and (b) of the\nCriminal Code\n, a peace officer is authorized to arrest without warrant a person whom he believes on reasonable and probable grounds has committed, is committing or is about to commit a criminal offence. It is, of course, a criminal offence under then s. 118(a) -- now s. 129(a) -- of the\nCriminal Code\n, to wilfully obstruct a peace officer in the execution of his duty. An arrest may be lawful even though the person arrested is subsequently acquitted of an offence charged, for it is the circumstances apparent to the officer at the time of the arrest that determine the validity of the arrest. In this case, I find that the circumstances at the time were such that the arrest of Mrs. Babyn cannot be found to be unlawful (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.)), and that she was informed at the time by Huget of the charge for which she was arrested.\n\n[27]\nI am, however, satisfied that the officers used excessive force in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn. I reach that conclusion for the following reasons:\n(1) The necessity for the officers to control the situation did not require the use of force. When Huget entered the kitchen/dining area and saw Mrs. Babyn to his left, while he saw her moving and did not know for what purpose, his evidence is that she had nothing in her hands. He was not then, or later, concerned about her attempting to escape or about his ability with his officers, to maintain control of the situation. His concerns earlier, when outside she had hurriedly departed for the house, that she might seek to destroy evidence or obtain a weapon were matters well within his observation of her activities in the kitchen/dining area and which he was then in a position to thwart if necessary.\n(2) The argument by the defendant that the officers only used such force as was necessary to restrain Mrs. Babyn's resistance to her arrest only has merit, if one concedes that the use of force in physically restraining her was necessary in the first place, whether by a wristlock as Huget says he attempted to apply, or by an armlock hold behind her back as Mrs. Babyn says was applied. I do not so concede. The evidence, in my view, does not support a conclusion that physical force was necessary at all to effect the arrest of Mrs. Babyn. Her arrest simply required that her freedom be restrained. In my view, there could be no doubt that this was a matter within control of the officers without the use of physical force. She explains her resistance to the use of force in her arrest by saying that after he arm was seized, she was trying to avoid the pain caused by the use of physical force and to protect herself. At first, she had pulled away from Huget because she did not understand why she was arrested. When told she was under arrest for obstruction, she had asked what for, not sharing any sense of Huget's conclusion that she had locked the door, for she is convinced she did not do so.\n(3) In a physical sense, even without the use of force, the officers dominated the situation and the use of force was unnecessary to maintain control. Huget, a senior officer with more than 25 years' service, is nearly six feet tall and weighs 170 pounds. Moritz, who arrived late on the scene and moved quickly to restrain Mrs. Babyn, had some 12 years of service at that time. He is six feet two inches tall and weighs 195 pounds. Mrs. Babyn is five feet one inch tall and weighs, then and now, about 135 pounds.\n\n[28]\nOne is tempted to say res ipsa loquitor. Perhaps Mr. Babyn aptly described the situation, with understatement, in two comments made in the course of his testimony. When asked what he did when his wife ended up on the floor with two police officers, he said (Transcript, vol. I, p. 171):\n\"Well, at that point, I made a step to move in and settle this thing out. To my way of thinking, it was getting a little ridiculous [...]\"\n\n[29]\nWhen asked at a later point how he felt about what happened in the kitchen that day, he said (Transcript, vol. I, p. 177):\n\"Well, it was -- at the time, I just woke up and all this happened in a matter of, you know, seconds almost. I was originally shocked. I couldn't believe it was happening, you know.\n\"I figured, you know, I didn't know what transpired outside before they came in. I was, you know, when it takes two big police officers to physically arrest a slightly small, middle-aged lady, you know, it makes you wonder.\"\n\n[30]\nPolice officers have a very difficult role in modern society. I appreciate that it is not made easier by review of their actions with the benefit of hindsight taking account of factors perhaps not fully understood at the time. Nevertheless, as officers trained in the use of force, their responsibilities are very great in the exercise of judgment about when force is necessary and what may be appropriate in the circumstances. Decisions made in the heat of the moment, if excessive force results, are not protected by s. 25(1) of the\nCriminal Code\n.\n\n[31]\nMoreover, in the circumstances of this case, where physical force was unnecessary to effect the arrest, any significant use of force is excessive and it constitutes an assault upon the person physically restrained by the use of force.\nThe Alleged Malicious Prosecution\n\n[32]\nFollowing her arrest and release on April 21, Mr. Babyn filed a complaint, alleging assault by the officers involved in her arrest, with the officer-in-charge of their detachment at Leduc. That charge was investigated in the normal course of dealing by the Force with complaints about the conduct of its members. The result of that complaint, if known at the time of trial, was not in evidence and is, in any event, irrelevant to these proceedings.\n\n[33]\nAs earlier noted, in June a second charge was laid against Mrs. Babyn, that on April 21 she unlawfully assaulted Corporal Huget with intent to resist her arrest or detention, contrary to s. 246(1) of the\nCriminal Code\n. Subsequently, that charge was not prosecuted, though it was not withdrawn until she appeared at court in response to a summons in September. The process resulted in her incurring $250 costs for her lawyer's services in preparation and in appearing with her in relation to the charge. She claims damages for injury to her reputation, for inconvenience and the expense incurred.\n\n[34]\nThis claim is based on alleged malicious prosecution, without reasonable and probable cause. The claim arises in substantial part because of the sequence of the arrest and original charge for obstruction of a peace officer, Mrs. Babyn's complaint to the R.C.M.P. about the conduct of the officers involved in her arrest, and the subsequent charge of assault in resisting arrest.\n\n[35]\nTo establish the requirements of tort of malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must satisfy four elements. These are described by A.M. Linden in\nCanadian Tort Law\n(5th Ed., Butterworths, 1993, Toronto, at p. 49):\n\"The tort of malicious prosecution, though closely related to false imprisonment, is somewhat different, requiring the presence of four elements. First, criminal proceedings must have been instituted by the defendant against the plaintiff; second, those proceedings must have been concluded favourably to the plaintiff; third, there must have been a lack of reasonable and probable cause for the defendant's conduct, and fourth, there must have been an improper purpose underlying the defendant's conduct, not an honest belief in guilt.\"\n\n[36]\nI am satisfied on the evidence of the officers, Huget, Brooks and Moritz, that there was no conspiracy on their part, as the plaintiff alleged, to initiate the second charge. All professed not to be concerned about Mrs. Babyn's complaint to the Force.\n\n[37]\nHuget's evidence was that the practice followed in relation to the laying of charges at their detachment in Alberta is that all charges initially laid by arresting officers are reviewed, before the initial appearance date, by the provincial Crown prosecutor who ultimately determines on the basis of the police reports whether those charges are to be pursued or dropped and whether any additional charges should be laid. The general practice in Alberta as described by Huget was supported by the testimony of Brooks and Moritz.\n\n[38]\nIn this case, the Crown prosecutor, after reviewing the reports, had instructed that the second charge against Mrs. Babyn be laid, and it would have been the prosecutor who subsequently decided that it be withdrawn without prosecution. Apparently, the decision to withdraw the second charge was made before the date fixed for its hearing, for none of the officers involved appeared for the hearing. It is unfortunate that Mrs. Babyn and her lawyer were not informed until they appeared, but any fault in neglecting to advise her, in the circumstances of this case, was not that of the police officers involved, but was that of the prosecutor's office.\n\n[39]\nI conclude that the elements of the tort of malicious prosecution are not established in this case. I add that no evidence of loss was adduced in relation to this alleged wrong, except the expense incurred by Mrs. Babyn for her lawyer's fees. Since there was no wrong, in relation to the second charge laid, for which the defendant's servants were liable, there is no ground to consider compensating her for that expense.\nDamages Claimed\n\n[40]\nI have found that the police officers involved in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn used excessive force. In so doing, they assaulted Mrs. Babyn. I conclude that the physical injuries suffered by Mrs. Babyn were caused directly by that assault. For the defendant, it is pleaded that any damages or injuries she suffered were caused or contributed to by the plaintiff in obstructing and resisting Her Majesty's peace officers. Since the obstruction of the officers in execution of their duties was identified by Huget as her closing and, he believed, her locking the back door after she entered, it was not that incident that resulted in injury to her. Her injury arose only from the physical force applied in arresting her. There is no doubt she struggled when Huget sought to physically restrain her, but I accept Mrs. Babyn's testimony that she did not understand what she had done to warrant the effort to physically restrain her, and further, that she was seeking to avoid the pain, from the armhold applied to her, by bending and pulling away. Since I have concluded that in the circumstances there was no necessity for Huget to physically restrain her, I do not find that her efforts to avoid the pain of his grasp caused or contributed to her injuries.\n\n[41]\nThe struggle lasted a very brief time. I have no doubt that all involved, in retrospect, regret that it happened at all and that it ended as it did. While one cannot predict how anyone seized by the arm by a police officer will react, in circumstances where the person does not understand the reason for being seized, asks for a reason and is told simply that they are under arrest for obstruction, the manner of their reaction in the very short term does not, in my view, provide a defence or even a basis for a finding of contributory negligence if the officers' action were deemed to be negligent.\n\n[42]\nIt is implicit in the defence offered that Mrs. Babyn should have meekly submitted to Huget's use of force. In my view, the situation was entirely within his control and that of his colleagues. That control would not have been threatened by his restraint from any use of force, or once he had taken Mrs. Babyn's arm and found her resisting, to have simply released her. In the circumstances of this case, that would have been an equally effective way to end the scuffle as expecting Mrs. Babyn to do nothing to try to avoid physical restraint and pain which was unnecessary.\n\n[43]\nThere was no evidence to counter that of Mrs. Babyn that as a result of the manner of her arrest, she suffered pain, mainly in her back, shoulders and arms. On the day after her arrest, she went to a Doctor of Chiropractic, Dr. Sindelar, in Wetaskiwin, who had treated her previously for back problems. In his opinion, the injuries he found were caused by the physical actions of the officers in arresting her, as those actions were described to him by the plaintiff, and based also on his understanding of arrest techniques employed by the police in Alberta. While I am not prepared to accept his knowledge of police techniques as a proper basis for his assigning cause for the injuries, there is no evidence, explanation or theory offered at trial to suggest these injuries arose from any other event than the physical force used in effecting Mrs. Babyn's arrest.\n\n[44]\nI note for the record that Dr. Sindelar filed an affidavit and was accepted, after questioning but without objection, as an expert witness in chiropractic, in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal dysfunction, and with special expertise in Ju-Jitsu and self-defence techniques.\n\n[45]\nDr. Sindelar had treated Mrs. Babyn previously for back problems in 1984 and 1986, but that condition had been alleviated and she had not had treatment for about a year when she came to see him on April 22, 1987. His initial examination that day revealed swelling and tenderness in the muscles along the entire spine, in the pectoral muscles, evidence of pain and weakness in upper body muscles, restricted and stiff movement from the hips upward, particularly in the lower back, neck and both shoulders. His diagnosis was an acute traumatic spinal and shoulder injury resulting in subluxations (or small dislocations) of the 5th cervical, 1st and 5th thoracic, and 3rd and 5th lumbar vertebrae, with paravertebral muscular strain, along with a bilateral shoulder sprain. Her earlier condition in the right sacroiliac region was re-aggravated.\n\n[46]\nMrs. Babyn continued treatment by Dr. Sindelar following her initial visit in April 1987, once a week for a time and thereafter twice monthly, and she was still seeing him on a regular basis at the time of the trial. In July 1992, he had reexamined her to assess her condition at that time. Some muscles in the lumbar and mid-thoracic area were sore and tender, and there was restricted motion throughout the entire spine, and weakness in a number of muscles. His diagnosis at that time confirmed subluxations of the 5th thoracic and 5th lumbar vertebrae, causing arthritic and degenerative change in the thoracic spine and right sacroiliac joint. It is Dr. Sindelar's opinion that since the original diagnosis on April 22, 1987, arthritic and degenerative changes had accelerated beyond the norm that would be expected for someone of Mrs. Babyn's age.\n\n[47]\nThe doctor's prognosis, at the time of his affidavit sworn in January 1993, was poor, and he expected Mrs. Babyn to be bothered periodically for the rest of her life due to the arthritic and degenerative changes in the cervical and thoracic spine.\n\n[48]\nMrs. Babyn's evidence is that she continues to suffer discomfort, occasional pain and back problems if she undertakes strenuous work. She has little strength in her arms and is unable to lift, for example, her grandchildren. She is not able to do heavy work in the garden as she once did. She spoke of inability to undertake physical work in the farming operation, with reference to her previous work when the Babyns operated a dairy farm. Since they no longer do so, having switched to raising beef cattle in 1986 as Mr. Babyn testified, I take Mrs. Babyn's references to work on the dairy farm as illustrations of physical work she once did but is no longer able to do because of the injury to her back as a result of the assault on April 21, 1987. Mr. Babyn's evidence generally supported his wife's more limited physical activity since the incident.\n\n[49]\nI turn to the plaintiff's claims for damages. She seeks, in relation to the two causes of action pleaded, special damages, general damages of $50,000 and exemplary or punitive damages of $10,000. I consider only those heads of damages as they are related to the assault, not as they might be affected by the claim for malicious prosecution which I have found is not established.\n\n[50]\nSpecial damages are claimed, and are awarded, in the amount of $2,308.78. Of that total, $1,092.50 is for costs incurred for the plaintiff's share of fees for services rendered by Dr. Sindelar and not recoverable under the public health program in Alberta. The balance, $1,216.28, is for the cost of transportation, at reasonable rates, for vehicle operation in travel from the Babyns' home to Dr. Sindelar's office in Wetaskawin.\n\n[51]\nCounsel for the plaintiff made reference to Goldsmith's Damage Tables in relation to awards of general damages in other cases involving spinal injuries below the neck. None of the examples were Alberta cases, all were cases decided from 1981 to 1989, mainly in the early to mid-1980's. General damage awards for physical injury to the back ranged from $10,000 to $65,000, the highest award being in a case of more serious injury, involving two fusions, some resulting drug addition and some permanent partial disability.\n\n[52]\nIn my view, in light of the prognosis for Mrs. Babyn's condition, that she is likely to be bothered for the rest of her life with accelerated arthritic and degenerative conditions, and in light of the restrictive changes her injury has caused in her lifestyle, the appropriate award of general damages in this case is $25,000. I include in this figure a measure for aggravated damages reflecting my conclusion that in the circumstances of this case, the use of physical force in the arrest of Mrs. Babyn and the extent to which that force was used was unnecessary. There is no doubt in my mind that she suffered loss of dignity as a result of the use of force in her arrest in the kitchen of her own home, in circumstances where it ought to have been evident to the officers concerned, even as events rapidly unfolded, that she presented no threat to them or to their control of the situation.\n\n[53]\nThe plaintiff claims exemplary or punitive damages. In my view, the circumstances of this case do not warrant any such award. There is no evidence of malicious conduct, or intentional, high-handed and abusive conduct found by my colleague Mr. Justice Cullen in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), or by my colleague Mr. Justice Muldoon in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . On appeal of the latter case, Mr. Justice MacGuigan, for the Court of Appeal, discussed punitive damages and their award against the Crown (see\nHer Majesty the Queen in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 193; [1989] 4 W.W.R. 218; 36 B.C.L.R.(2d) 273; 90 C.L.L.C. 14,035; 25 C.C.E.L. 81, where Mr. Justice McIntyre for the majority of the Supreme Court said:\n\"Moreover, punitive damages may only be awarded in respect of conduct which is of such a nature as to be deserving of punishment because of its harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious nature. I do not suggest that I have exhausted the adjectives which could describe the conduct capable of characterizing a punitive award, but in any case, where such an award is made, the conduct must be extreme in its nature and such that by any reasonable standard, it is deserving of full condemnation and punishment.\"\n\n[54]\nThe conduct of the officers involved in Mrs. Babyn's arrest involved errors of judgment in circumstances that developed quickly, but it did not constitute action that was vindictive, or malicious, or deserving of punishment. Having found aggravated general damages are warranted, I need hardly say that the conduct of the officers is disapproved of and not to be encouraged or condoned, even if it does not warrant punitive damages.\nConclusion\n\n[55]\nAs counsel for the plaintiff noted at trial, this action was originally initiated against the three R.C.M.P. officers -- Huget, Brooks and Moritz -- as well as the defendant, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Subsequently, by notice of discontinuance filed April 23, 1990, the action was wholly discontinued against the three named officers. No order to vary the style of cause in the action has since been made, and ex proprio motu this court by order included in the judgment filed with these reasons, directs that the style of cause now include only Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as defendant in the action.\n\n[56]\nI have concluded that the R.C.M.P. officers used excessive force in effecting the arrest of the plaintiff and thus assaulted her, which caused her expense and personal injury, with resulting impairment and discomfort expected to continue for her lifetime. It is acknowledged, on behalf of the defendant, that the officers were acting in the course of their duties as servants of Her Majesty. The defendant is thus liable in damages pursuant to the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\nin relation to the claim by the plaintiff. For reasons outlined, those damages are fixed by judgment filed with these reasons, as follows:\nFor special damages - $ 2,308.78\nFor general damages - $25,000.00\n\n[57]\nThe award of damages is subject to post-judgment interest in accord with s. 31.1 of the\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act\nas amended.\n\n[58]\nThe plaintiff's claims for damages for alleged malicious prosecution and for punitive damages are not established and are not allowed.\n\n[59]\nThe plaintiff asked for costs, and at trial counsel submitted that these be on a solicitor and client basis, but no argument was addressed, and I see no ground for finding the sort of conduct in relation to preparations for and proceedings in this action which would warrant costs on that basis. The plaintiff is, however, entitled to recover costs on the usual party and party basis and the judgment filed herein so provides.\nJudgment for plaintiff.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/sms\n[End of document]",
