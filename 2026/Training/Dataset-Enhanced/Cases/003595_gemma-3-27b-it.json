Darnay, for the applicant; \n \n Keitha Elvin-Jensen, for the respondent. \n \n \n \n Solicitors of Record: \n \n Christopher Darnay, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the applicant; \n \n Myles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the respondent. \n \n \n \n This application for judicial review was heard at Vancouver, British Columbia, on August 4, 2010, before Mandamin, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following reasons for judgment and judgment, dated February 4, 2011.",
    "[1] \n   \n Mandamin, J. \n : The Applicant, Mr. Allan Arthur Crawshaw, applies for judicial review of the decision of the Senior Deputy Commissioner (the Commissioner) on October 27, 2009 denying the Applicant's grievance about the implementation of a stand-to count at the Mission Institution in British Columbia where the Applicant is a serving inmate.",
    "[2] \n  The Applicant grieved about the implementation of a 22:40 stand-to count. A \"stand-to count\", as the name suggests, requires prisoners to stand up for a count by Correctional Services officers. The Applicant raised a number of objections in his grievance about the 22:40 stand-to count. Since the grievance involved a policy matter instituted by the Commissioner, it proceeded directly to the highest order of grievance, a third level grievance. The Commissioner denied the grievance.",
    "[3] \n  The Applicant now applies for judicial review focusing on one issue: that the Commissioner failed to consider that the 22:40 stand-to count adversely and disproportionably affected him and other elderly inmates.",
    "[4] \n  For reasons that follow, I am denying this application for judicial review. \n \n \n \n Background",
    "[5] \n  The Applicant is a 62 year old inmate at the Mission Institution, a medium security institution. He is serving a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 25 years until May 17, 2015. Due to his age and his various activities in prison including study and tutoring, the Applicant chooses to go to bed between 20:30 to 21:00 hours.",
    "[6] \n  A \"stand-to count\" is defined in Commissioner's Directive 566-4 - Inmate Counts and Security Patrols as follows: \n \n \n \n \"A formal count of inmates in a standing position, facing the counting stall member to ensure facial identification is made except in cases where exemptions for medical conditions or physical limitations have been identified.\"",
    "[7] \n  The Bulletin was issued in response to the recommendations of a Coroner's Inquest and a report by the Officer of the Correctional Investigator into Deaths in Custody. The Jury recommendations at the Coroner's Inquest into the death of an inmate at the Collins Bay Institution included: \n \n \n \n \"1. It is recommended that correctional service of Canada (CSC) undertake a feasibility study on making the count when the cells are locked for the night a stand-to count. \n \n \n \n \"2. It is recommended that CSC issue a security bulletin reinforcing the existing requirement that ensures correctional staff confirm that an inmate is alive and breathing during a formal count and identify the manner by which such verification is made. \n \n \n \n \"3. It is recommended that every count be done by a correctional officer (CO) should verify that there is a living and breathing inmate in each occupied cell.\" \n \n \n \n The Office of the Correctional Investigator's report on Deaths in Custody also discussed the failure of correctional officers to ensure that inmates are still alive in their cells as an issue that frequently arose in a review of deaths in custody from 2001 to 2005.",
    "[8] \n  On July 10, 2009, Correctional Services Canada (CSC) issued a Security Branch Bulletin setting out a change with respect to stand-to counts at federal institutions. The Bulletin provided that stand-to counts must be conducted as follows: \n \n \n \n - For maximum, medium, and multi-level security institutions including women's institutions there will be two stand-to counts; \n \n \n \n - One of the two stand-to counts must be completed between the hours of 18:00 and 24:00",
    "[9] \n  Following receipt of the Bulletin, CSC staff at Mission Institution consulted with the Inmate Committee. On July 16, 2009, Acting Warden Corinne Justason announced that it had been determined that it would be least disruptive to incorporate the stand-to count into the unit lock up count at 22:40 hours.",
    "[10] \n  The Applicant filed a third level grievance on July 17, 2009 in response to the implementation of the 22:40 stand-to count raising a number of objections and requesting the 22:40 stand-to count be removed as it was arbitrary, capricious and without legal justification.",
    "[11] \n  The Applicant argued the Bulletin did not have the force of law as it was only a directive for administrative purposes. He submitted the CSC must consider the health factor of all elderly prisoners referencing section 87 of the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n  quoting: \"the Service shall take into consideration an offender's state of health and healthcare needs (a) in all decisions affecting the offender ...\" He likens the stand-to count as punishment by means of sleep deprivation. He declares CSC is in violation of section11 of the  \n Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \n  and raises an argument for procedural fairness invoking section 7 of the  \n Charter \n . He contends the stand-to count did not ensure the security of any prisoner, staff member or Canadian citizen. He alleged it was discrimination against him because of age. Finally, he claimed there was no consultation with inmates. In short, the Applicant raised a broad range of issues in grieving the 22:40 stand-to count.",
    "[12] \n  His grievance was denied by the Commissioner on October 27, 2009. \n \n \n \n Decision Under Review",
    "[13] \n  In the Offender Grievance Response dated October 27, 2009, the Commissioner responded to the Applicant's grievance, grouping the issues the Applicant raises into the four areas. Since the Applicant focuses on one issue, the impact of the 22:40 stand-to count on himself and elderly inmates, I have extracted and summarized the portions of the Commissioner's decision relevant to the issue the Applicant addresses in this judicial review.",
    "[14] \n   \n Issue One: Security Bulletin \n : the Commissioner stated the Bulletin's directive on a late night stand-to count is in response to the Corner's Inquest and the Death in Custody Report recommendations. As such the regulations are not punishment but part of an effort to save lives. Further, exemptions to the stand-to counts exist for medical conditions or physical limitations.",
    "[15] \n   \n Issue Two: Danger of Being Awoken \n : the Commissioner noted that Paragraph 11 of CD 566-4 provides that inmates with medical conditions or physical limitations deemed by the Chief of Health Services as unable to respond to, or perform a stand-to count request, are exempt. In such cases inmates must be awake and signal the staff member through an alternative means, normally a hand signal. There is no indication that the 22:40 count poses a significant health risk to the (inmate) population as a whole.",
    "[16] \n   \n Issue Three Targets the Elderly \n : the Commissioner wrote \"There is no indication why you believe the stand-to counts punish the elderly more than other offenders. There is nothing specific as to who must attend the stand-to as the Bulletin applies to all.\"",
    "[17] \n   \n Issue Four: Offender Participation \n : the Commissioner noted the Inmate Committee was consulted. A number of other times were considered and the 22:40 count was determined to be the most efficient and least disruptive. The morning unlock is 07:00 providing for 8 hours between counts.",
    "[18] \n  The Commissioner denied the Applicant's grievance in each of the above four issue categories addressing the whole of the subject matter of the grievance. The above extracted responses from those categories in the Commissioner's decision relate to the issue the Applicant raises in this judicial review. \n \n \n \n Legislation",
    "[19] \n  In respect of health and safety of inmates, the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n , 1992, c. 20 (the  \n CCRA \n ) provides: \n \n \n \n \"3. The purpose of the federal correctional system is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by \n \n \n \n (a) carrying out sentences imposed by courts through the safe and humane custody and supervision of offenders; and \n \n \n \n (b) assisting the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community as law-abiding citizens through the provision of programs in penitentiaries and in the community. \n \n \n \n \"4. The principles that shall guide the Service in achieving the purpose referred to in section 3 are \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (d) that the Service uses the least restrictive measures consistent with the protection of the public, staff members and offenders; \n \n \n \n (e) that offenders retain the rights and privileges of all members of society, except those rights and privileges that are necessarily removed or restricted as a consequence of the sentence; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (g) that correctional decisions be made in a forthright and fair manner, with access by the offender to an effective grievance procedure; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (h) that correctional policies, programs and practices respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and be responsive to the special needs of women and aboriginal peoples, as well as to the needs of other groups of offenders with special requirements; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n \"70. The Service shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that penitentiaries, the penitentiary environment, the living and working conditions of inmates and the working conditions of staff members are safe, healthful and free of practices that undermine a person's sense of personal dignity. \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n “87. The Service shall take into consideration an offender's state of health and health care needs \n \n \n \n (a) in all decisions affecting the offender, including decisions relating to placement, transfer, administrative segregation and disciplinary matters; and \n \n \n \n (b) in the preparation of the offender for release and the supervision of the offender.\" \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \"3. The correctional system aims to contribute to the maintenance of a just society, living in peace and security, on the one hand, by ensuring the execution of sentences through safe and humane custody and supervision measures, and on the other hand, by assisting, through appropriate programs in penitentiaries or in the community, in the rehabilitation of offenders and their social reintegration as law-abiding citizens. \n \n \n \n \"4. The Service is guided, in the execution of this mandate, by the following principles: \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (d) the measures necessary to protect the public, officers and offenders must be as least restrictive as possible; \n \n \n \n e) the offender continues to enjoy the rights and privileges recognized to every citizen, except those whose suppression or restriction is a necessary consequence of the sentence imposed on him; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n g) its decisions must be clear and fair, with offenders having access to effective grievance mechanisms; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (h) its general orientation directives, programs and methods respect ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences, as well as between the sexes, and take into account the specific needs of women, indigenous people and other specific groups; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n “70. The Service takes all useful measures to ensure that the living and working environment of detainees and the working conditions of officers are healthy, safe and free from practices detrimental to human dignity. \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n \"87. Decisions concerning an offender, in particular regarding his placement, his transfer, his administrative segregation or any disciplinary question, as well as the preparatory measures for his release and his supervision during that release, must take into account his state of health and the care he requires.\"",
    "[20] \n  The inmate grievance procedures are set out in the  \n Regulations Respecting Corrections and the Conditional Release and Detention of Offenders \n  (SOR/92-620) and are appended in part to this judgment. \n \n \n \n Issues",
    "[21] \n  The Applicant submits the Commissioner failed to address the central issue raised in the grievance, namely that the 22:40 stand-to count adversely and disproportionately affects the Applicant and other elderly inmates. The Applicant expresses the issue as whether the Commissioner improperly declined to exercise his jurisdiction.",
    "[22] \n  The Respondent submits the issues are whether the Applicant was denied procedural fairness and whether the Commissioner committed a reviewable error based on the standard of review.",
    "[23] \n  In my view, the issues in this judicial review are: \n \n \n \n a) Did the Commissioner fail to address the issue that the stand-to count adversely and disproportionately affected the Applicant and other elderly inmates thereby committing a breach of procedural fairness? \n \n \n \n b) Was the Commissioner's response reasonable? \n \n \n \n Standard of Review",
    "[24] \n  There are now only two standards of review: reasonableness and correctness. A detailed analysis of which standard to apply in a given case is not required if it has been determined in earlier jurisprudence.  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED.",
    "[25] \n  The standard of review for decisions made pursuant to the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n  was addressed by the Federal Court of Appeal in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED)",
    "[26] \n  In  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n , the Federal Court of Appeal held that correctness applied to questions of law which include issues of procedural fairness, whereas the reasonableness [standard] would apply to the application of legal principles to fact and the standard of patent unreasonableness (now reasonableness) would apply to findings of fact.   \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n  confirms the application of these standards in CSC grievance procedures: \n \n \n \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED",
    "[27] \n  Accordingly, the Commissioner's findings of fact and of mixed law and fact should be evaluated on a standard of reasonableness. In reviewing the impugned decisions against the reasonableness standard, the Court will consider whether these decisions under review fall within a range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in light of the facts and the law.  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n \n \n \n Analysis",
    "[28] \n  The Applicant submits that, given the purpose and role of the grievance process in maintaining a safe, humane and lawful correctional system, the grievance process should provide inmates with an opportunity to be heard and to seek redress in a forthright and fair manner.",
    "[29] \n  The Applicant submits that the Commissioner failed to address one of the central issues he raised in his grievance, namely that he and other elderly inmates were adversely and disproportionately affected by the 22:40 stand-to count, and that he was seeking some type of accommodation based on his age. Instead of addressing this issue of whether the elderly should be accommodated, the Applicant contends the Commissioner only looked at whether the elderly were specifically targeted.",
    "[30] \n  The Applicant submits that the Commissioner's failure to directly address the central issue in a grievance is a wrongful failure to exercise jurisdiction and statutory power. His specific submission on this point had been: \n \n \n \n \"There are many elderly prisoners including myself, who will be impacted by the unnecessary late count. Many times, because of the stress of the everyday prison life, I have been forced to retire early to bed in order to reduce the stress and anxiety and get enough rest for next strenuous day, and now I will be discriminated against because of my age.\"",
    "[31] \n  The Applicant now submits the core of his grievance was not whether the elderly were \"specifically targeted\" but whether the elderly should be accommodated. \n \n \n \n Did the Commissioner fail to address the issues raised by the Applicant?",
    "[32] \n  Although the Applicant now frames the issue of whether the elderly should be accommodated as the central issue, there is nothing in his third level grievance to suggest that this was the central issue. In his third level grievance, the Applicant raised myriad issues. He was not merely seeking accommodation for himself or for other elderly inmates in respect of the 22:40 stand-to count but rather was seeking to remove the 22:40 stand-to count altogether.",
    "[33] \n  In the response, the Commissioner explained the purpose of the stand-to count as being to save lives. The Commissioner also explained that the policy does not specifically target the elderly and that the Applicant did not provide any reason why he believed the stand-to counts punished the elderly more than other offenders.",
    "[34] \n  The Applicant, in his submissions, accepts the elderly are not targeted within the prison population since the Bulletin applies to all inmates. The Applicant now submits he is disproportionately affected by the late night stand-to count because of his age and the Commissioner failed to address his grievance in terms of adverse impact of the 22:40 stand-to count.",
    "[35] \n  In my view the Commissioner adequately addressed the Applicant's grievance about adverse impacts by: first, pointing out that the stand-to count was implemented in response to recommendations to save lives; second, noting there was no information that 22:40 stand-to count adversely affected other elderly inmates; and third, indicating that there is provision for exemptions from the stand-to count for medical and physical limitations. \n \n \n \n Was the Commissioner's response reasonable?",
    "[36] \n  The Applicant cites  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED to support his claim that an inmate has the right to a restful night's sleep without being unnecessarily awakened. In that case, the applicant inmate was purposely awakened two to three times a night. This is not the situation the Applicant now faces with the regularly scheduled stand-to count at 22:40.",
    "[37] \n  The Commissioner noted there is an eight hour span between the 22:40 stand-to count and the 7:00 morning unlock count. As such, I consider the Commissioner's finding that the 22:40 stand-to count allows for an appropriate period for sleep as reasonable.",
    "[38] \n  The Commissioner was mindful that medical exemptions are available to inmates who qualify and apply for them. At no point did the Applicant address the option of seeking of a personal exemption based on medical or physical limitations.",
    "[39] \n  The onus was on the Applicant to show some basis for his contention that the stand-to count posed a significant health risk to elderly inmates. While the Applicant may be personally unhappy with the time of the stand-to count, there was nothing to show other elderly inmates were negatively affected especially given the fact that an unbroken eight hour span is available for sleep and exemptions are available for medical or physical limitations. \n \n \n \n Conclusion",
    "[40] \n  I find the Commissioner's response to the Applicant's grievance adequately addressed the issue the Applicant now raises in this judicial review.",
    "[41] \n  I further find the Commissioner's response satisfies the reasonableness requirements of justification, transparency and intelligibility, and clearly falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes, as set out in  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. The Commissioner's response to the Applicant's third-level grievance was reasonable.",
    "[42] \n  I dismiss this application for judicial review.",
    "[43] \n  I make no order for costs. \n \n \n \n JUDGMENT",
    "[44] THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that \n : \n \n \n \n 1. The application for judicial review is dismissed. \n \n \n \n 2. No order for costs is made. \n \n \n \n Application dismissed. \n \n \n \n Editor: E.

Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the respondent. \n \n \n \n This application for judicial review was heard at Vancouver, British Columbia, on August 4, 2010, before Mandamin, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following reasons for judgment and judgment, dated February 4, 2011. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n [1] \n   \n Mandamin, J. \n : The Applicant, Mr. Allan Arthur Crawshaw, applies for judicial review of the decision of the Senior Deputy Commissioner (the Commissioner) on October 27, 2009 denying the Applicant's grievance about the implementation of a stand-to count at the Mission Institution in British Columbia where the Applicant is a serving inmate. \n \n \n \n [2] \n  The Applicant grieved about the implementation of a 22:40 stand-to count. A \"stand-to count\", as the name suggests, requires prisoners to stand up for a count by Correctional Services officers. The Applicant raised a number of objections in his grievance about the 22:40 stand-to count. Since the grievance involved a policy matter instituted by the Commissioner, it proceeded directly to the highest order of grievance, a third level grievance. The Commissioner denied the grievance. \n \n \n \n [3] \n  The Applicant now applies for judicial review focusing on one issue: that the Commissioner failed to consider that the 22:40 stand-to count adversely and disproportionably affected him and other elderly inmates. \n \n \n \n [4] \n  For reasons that follow, I am denying this application for judicial review. \n \n \n \n Background \n \n \n \n [5] \n  The Applicant is a 62 year old inmate at the Mission Institution, a medium security institution. He is serving a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 25 years until May 17, 2015. Due to his age and his various activities in prison including study and tutoring, the Applicant chooses to go to bed between 20:30 to 21:00 hours. \n \n \n \n [6] \n  A \"stand-to count\" is defined in Commissioner's Directive 566-4 - Inmate Counts and Security Patrols as follows: \n \n \n \n \"A formal count of inmates in a standing position, facing the counting stall member to ensure facial identification is made except in cases where exemptions for medical conditions or physical limitations have been identified.\" \n \n \n \n [7] \n  The Bulletin was issued in response to the recommendations of a Coroner's Inquest and a report by the Officer of the Correctional Investigator into Deaths in Custody. The Jury recommendations at the Coroner's Inquest into the death of an inmate at the Collins Bay Institution included: \n \n \n \n \"1. It is recommended that correctional service of Canada (CSC) undertake a feasibility study on making the count when the cells are locked for the night a stand-to count. \n \n \n \n \"2. It is recommended that CSC issue a security bulletin reinforcing the existing requirement that ensures correctional staff confirm that an inmate is alive and breathing during a formal count and identify the manner by which such verification is made. \n \n \n \n \"3. It is recommended that every count be done by a correctional officer (CO) should verify that there is a living and breathing inmate in each occupied cell.\" \n \n \n \n The Office of the Correctional Investigator's report on Deaths in Custody also discussed the failure of correctional officers to ensure that inmates are still alive in their cells as an issue that frequently arose in a review of deaths in custody from 2001 to 2005. \n \n \n \n [8] \n  On July 10, 2009, Correctional Services Canada (CSC) issued a Security Branch Bulletin setting out a change with respect to stand-to counts at federal institutions. The Bulletin provided that stand-to counts must be conducted as follows: \n \n \n \n - For maximum, medium, and multi-level security institutions including women's institutions there will be two stand-to counts; \n \n \n \n - One of the two stand-to counts must be completed between the hours of 18:00 and 24:00 \n \n \n \n [9] \n  Following receipt of the Bulletin, CSC staff at Mission Institution consulted with the Inmate Committee. On July 16, 2009, Acting Warden Corinne Justason announced that it had been determined that it would be least disruptive to incorporate the stand-to count into the unit lock up count at 22:40 hours. \n \n \n \n [10] \n  The Applicant filed a third level grievance on July 17, 2009 in response to the implementation of the 22:40 stand-to count raising a number of objections and requesting the 22:40 stand-to count be removed as it was arbitrary, capricious and without legal justification. \n \n \n \n [11] \n  The Applicant argued the Bulletin did not have the force of law as it was only a directive for administrative purposes. He submitted the CSC must consider the health factor of all elderly prisoners referencing section 87 of the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n  quoting: \"the Service shall take into consideration an offender's state of health and healthcare needs (a) in all decisions affecting the offender ...\" He likens the stand-to count as punishment by means of sleep deprivation. He declares CSC is in violation of section11 of the  \n Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \n  and raises an argument for procedural fairness invoking section 7 of the  \n Charter \n . He contends the stand-to count did not ensure the security of any prisoner, staff member or Canadian citizen. He alleged it was discrimination against him because of age. Finally, he claimed there was no consultation with inmates. In short, the Applicant raised a broad range of issues in grieving the 22:40 stand-to count. \n \n \n \n [12] \n  His grievance was denied by the Commissioner on October 27, 2009. \n \n \n \n Decision Under Review \n \n \n \n [13] \n  In the Offender Grievance Response dated October 27, 2009, the Commissioner responded to the Applicant's grievance, grouping the issues the Applicant raises into the four areas. Since the Applicant focuses on one issue, the impact of the 22:40 stand-to count on himself and elderly inmates, I have extracted and summarized the portions of the Commissioner's decision relevant to the issue the Applicant addresses in this judicial review. \n \n \n \n [14] \n   \n Issue One: Security Bulletin \n : the Commissioner stated the Bulletin's directive on a late night stand-to count is in response to the Corner's Inquest and the Death in Custody Report recommendations. As such the regulations are not punishment but part of an effort to save lives. Further, exemptions to the stand-to counts exist for medical conditions or physical limitations. \n \n \n \n [15] \n   \n Issue Two: Danger of Being Awoken \n : the Commissioner noted that Paragraph 11 of CD 566-4 provides that inmates with medical conditions or physical limitations deemed by the Chief of Health Services as unable to respond to, or perform a stand-to count request, are exempt. In such cases inmates must be awake and signal the staff member through an alternative means, normally a hand signal. There is no indication that the 22:40 count poses a significant health risk to the (inmate) population as a whole. \n \n \n \n [16] \n   \n Issue Three Targets the Elderly \n : the Commissioner wrote \"There is no indication why you believe the stand-to counts punish the elderly more than other offenders. There is nothing specific as to who must attend the stand-to as the Bulletin applies to all.\" \n \n \n \n [17] \n   \n Issue Four: Offender Participation \n : the Commissioner noted the Inmate Committee was consulted. A number of other times were considered and the 22:40 count was determined to be the most efficient and least disruptive. The morning unlock is 07:00 providing for 8 hours between counts. \n \n \n \n [18] \n  The Commissioner denied the Applicant's grievance in each of the above four issue categories addressing the whole of the subject matter of the grievance. The above extracted responses from those categories in the Commissioner's decision relate to the issue the Applicant raises in this judicial review. \n \n \n \n Legislation \n \n \n \n [19] \n  In respect of health and safety of inmates, the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n , 1992, c. 20 (the  \n CCRA \n ) provides: \n \n \n \n \"3. The purpose of the federal correctional system is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by \n \n \n \n (a) carrying out sentences imposed by courts through the safe and humane custody and supervision of offenders; and \n \n \n \n (b) assisting the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community as law-abiding citizens through the provision of programs in penitentiaries and in the community. \n \n \n \n \"4. The principles that shall guide the Service in achieving the purpose referred to in section 3 are \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (d) that the Service use the least restrictive measures consistent with the protection of the public, staff members and offenders; \n \n \n \n (e) that offenders retain the rights and privileges of all members of society, except those rights and privileges that are necessarily removed or restricted as a consequence of the sentence; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (g) that correctional decisions be made in a forthright and fair manner, with access by the offender to an effective grievance procedure; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (h) that correctional policies, programs and practices respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and be responsive to the special needs of women and aboriginal peoples, as well as to the needs of other groups of offenders with special requirements; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n \"70. The Service shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that penitentiaries, the penitentiary environment, the living and working conditions of inmates and the working conditions of staff members are safe, healthful and free of practices that undermine a person's sense of personal dignity. \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n \"87. The Service shall take into consideration an offender's state of health and health care needs \n \n \n \n (a) in all decisions affecting the offender, including decisions relating to placement, transfer, administrative segregation and disciplinary matters; and \n \n \n \n (b) in the preparation of the offender for release and the supervision of the offender.\" \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \"3. Le système correctionnel vise à contribuer au maintien d'une société juste, vivant en paix et en sécurité, d'une part, en assurant l'exécution des peines par des mesures de garde et de surveillance sécuritaires et humaines, et d'autre part, en aidant au moyen de programmes appropriés dans les pénitenciers ou dans la collectivité, à la réadaptation des délinquants et à leur réinsertion sociale à titre de citoyens respectueux des lois. \n \n \n \n \"4. Le Service est guidé, dans l'exécution de ce mandat, par les principes qui suivent: \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n d) les mesures nécessaires à la protection du public, des agents et des délinquants doivent être le moins restrictives possible; \n \n \n \n e) le délinquant continue à jouir des droits et privilèges reconnus à tout citoyen, sauf de ceux dont la suppression ou restriction est une conséquence nécessaire de la peine qui lui est infligée; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n g) ses décisions doivent être claires et équitables, les délinquants ayant accès à des mécanismes efficaces de règlement de griefs; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n h) ses directives d'orientation générale, programmes et méthodes respectent les différences ethniques, culturelles et linguistiques, ainsi qu'entre les sexes, et tiennent compte des besoins propres aux femmes, aux autochtones et à d'autres groupes particuliers; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n \"70. Le Service prend toutes mesures utiles pour que le milieu de vie et de travail des détenus et les conditions de travail des agents soient sains, sécuritaires et exempts de pratiques portant atteinte à la dignité humaine. \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n \"87. Les décisions concernant un délinquant, notamment en ce qui touche son placement, son transfèrement, son isolement préventif ou toute question disciplinaire, ainsi que les mesures préparatoires à sa mise en liberté et sa surveillance durant celle-ci, doivent tenir compte de son état de santé et des soins qu'il requiert.\" \n \n \n \n [20] \n  The inmate grievance procedures are set out in the  \n Regulations Respecting Corrections and the Conditional Release and Detention of Offenders \n  (SOR/92-620) and are appended in part to this judgment. \n \n \n \n Issues \n \n \n \n [21] \n  The Applicant submits the Commissioner failed to address the central issue raised in the grievance, namely that the 22:40 stand-to count adversely and disproportionately affects the Applicant and other elderly inmates. The Applicant expresses the issue as whether the Commissioner improperly declined to exercise his jurisdiction. \n \n \n \n [22] \n  The Respondent submits the issues are whether the Applicant was denied procedural fairness and whether the Commissioner committed a reviewable error based on the standard of review. \n \n \n \n [23] \n  In my view, the issues in this judicial review are: \n \n \n \n a) Did the Commissioner fail to address the issue that the stand-to count adversely and disproportionately affected the Applicant and other elderly inmates thereby committing a breach of procedural fairness? \n \n \n \n b) Was the Commissioner's response reasonable? \n \n \n \n Standard of Review \n \n \n \n [24] \n  There are now only two standards of review: reasonableness and correctness. A detailed analysis of which standard to apply in a given case is not required if it has been determined in earlier jurisprudence.  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. \n \n \n \n [25] \n  The standard of review for decisions made pursuant to the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n  was addressed by the Federal Court of Appeal in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED) \n \n \n \n [26] \n  In  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n , the Federal Court of Appeal held that correctness applied to questions of law which include issues of procedural fairness, whereas the reasonableness [standard] would apply to the application of legal principles to fact and the standard of patent unreasonableness (now reasonableness) would apply to findings of fact.   \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n  confirms the application of these standards in CSC grievance procedures: \n \n \n \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n \n \n \n [27] \n  Accordingly, the Commissioner's findings of fact and of mixed law and fact should be evaluated on a standard of reasonableness. In reviewing the impugned decisions against the reasonableness standard, the Court will consider whether these decisions under review fall within a range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in light of the facts and the law.  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n \n \n \n Analysis \n \n \n \n [28] \n  The Applicant submits that, given the purpose and role of the grievance process in maintaining a safe, humane and lawful correctional system, the grievance process should provide inmates with an opportunity to be heard and to seek redress in a forthright and fair manner. \n \n \n \n [29] \n  The Applicant submits that the Commissioner failed to address one of the central issues he raised in his grievance, namely that he and other elderly inmates were adversely and disproportionately affected by the 22:40 stand-to count, and that he was seeking some type of accommodation based on his age. Instead of addressing this issue of whether the elderly should be accommodated, the Applicant contends the Commissioner only looked at whether the elderly were specifically targeted. \n \n \n \n [30] \n  The Applicant submits that the Commissioner's failure to directly address the central issue in a grievance is a wrongful failure to exercise jurisdiction and statutory power. His specific submission on this point had been: \n \n \n \n \"There are many elderly prisoners including myself, who will be impacted by the unnecessary late count. Many times, because of the stress of the everyday prison life, I have been forced to retire early to bed in order to reduce the stress and anxiety and get enough rest for next strenuous day, and now I will be discriminated against because of my age.\" \n \n \n \n [31] \n  The Applicant now submits the core of his grievance was not whether the elderly were \"specifically targeted\" but whether the elderly should be accommodated. \n \n \n \n Did the Commissioner fail to address the issues raised by the Applicant? \n \n \n \n [32] \n  Although the Applicant now frames the issue of whether the elderly should be accommodated as the central issue, there is nothing in his third level grievance to suggest that this was the central issue. In his third level grievance, the Applicant raised myriad issues. He was not merely seeking accommodation for himself or for other elderly inmates in respect of the 22:40 stand-to count but rather was seeking to remove the 22:40 stand-to count altogether. \n \n \n \n [33] \n  In the response, the Commissioner explained the purpose of the stand-to count as being to save lives. The Commissioner also explained that the policy does not specifically target the elderly and that the Applicant did not provide any reason why he believed the stand-to counts punished the elderly more than other offenders. \n \n \n \n [34] \n  The Applicant, in his submissions, accepts the elderly are not targeted within the prison population since the Bulletin applies to all inmates. The Applicant now submits he is disproportionately affected by the late night stand-to count because of his age and the Commissioner failed to address his grievance in terms of adverse impact of the 22:40 stand-to count. \n \n \n \n [35] \n  In my view the Commissioner adequately addressed the Applicant's grievance about adverse impacts by: first, pointing out that the stand-to count was implemented in response to recommendations to save lives; second, noting there was no information that 22:40 stand-to count adversely affected other elderly inmates; and third, indicating that there is provision for exemptions from the stand-to count for medical and physical limitations. \n \n \n \n Was the Commissioner's response reasonable? \n \n \n \n [36] \n  The Applicant cites  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED to support his claim that an inmate has the right to a restful night's sleep without being unnecessarily awakened. In that case, the applicant inmate was purposely awakened two to three times a night. This is not the situation the Applicant now faces with the regularly scheduled stand-to count at 22:40. \n \n \n \n [37] \n  The Commissioner noted there is an eight hour span between the 22:40 stand-to count and the 7:00 morning unlock count. As such, I consider the Commissioner's finding that the 22:40 stand-to count allows for an appropriate period for sleep as reasonable. \n \n \n \n [38] \n  The Commissioner was mindful that medical exemptions are available to inmates who qualify and apply for them. At no point did the Applicant address the option of seeking of a personal exemption based on medical or physical limitations. \n \n \n \n [39] \n  The onus was on the Applicant to show some basis for his contention that the stand-to count posed a significant health risk to elderly inmates. While the Applicant may be personally unhappy with the time of the stand-to count, there was nothing to show other elderly inmates were negatively affected especially given the fact that an unbroken eight hour span is available for sleep and exemptions are available for medical or physical limitations. \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \n \n [40] \n  I find the Commissioner's response to the Applicant's grievance adequately addressed the issue the Applicant now raises in this judicial review. \n \n \n \n [41] \n  I further find the Commissioner's response satisfies the reasonableness requirements of justification, transparency and intelligibility, and clearly falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes, as set out in  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. The Commissioner's response to the Applicant's third-level grievance was reasonable. \n \n \n \n [42] \n  I dismiss this application for judicial review. \n \n \n \n [43] \n  I make no order for costs. \n \n \n \n JUDGMENT \n \n \n \n [44] THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that \n : \n \n \n \n 1. The application for judicial review is dismissed. \n \n \n \n 2. No order for costs is made. \n \n \n \n Application dismissed. \n \n \n \n Editor: E.

Darnay, for the applicant; \n \n Keitha Elvin-Jensen, for the respondent. \n \n \n \n Solicitors of Record: \n \n Christopher Darnay, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the applicant; \n \n Myles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the respondent. \n \n \n \n This application for judicial review was heard at Vancouver, British Columbia, on August 4, 2010, before Mandamin, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following reasons for judgment and judgment, dated February 4, 2011.\n\n[1] \n   \n Mandamin, J. \n : The Applicant, Mr. Allan Arthur Crawshaw, applies for judicial review of the decision of the Senior Deputy Commissioner (the Commissioner) on October 27, 2009 denying the Applicant's grievance about the implementation of a stand-to count at the Mission Institution in British Columbia where the Applicant is a serving inmate.\n\n[2] \n  The Applicant grieved about the implementation of a 22:40 stand-to count. A \"stand-to count\", as the name suggests, requires prisoners to stand up for a count by Correctional Services officers. The Applicant raised a number of objections in his grievance about the 22:40 stand-to count. Since the grievance involved a policy matter instituted by the Commissioner, it proceeded directly to the highest order of grievance, a third level grievance. The Commissioner denied the grievance.\n\n[3] \n  The Applicant now applies for judicial review focusing on one issue: that the Commissioner failed to consider that the 22:40 stand-to count adversely and disproportionably affected him and other elderly inmates.\n\n[4] \n  For reasons that follow, I am denying this application for judicial review. \n \n \n \n Background\n\n[5] \n  The Applicant is a 62 year old inmate at the Mission Institution, a medium security institution. He is serving a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 25 years until May 17, 2015. Due to his age and his various activities in prison including study and tutoring, the Applicant chooses to go to bed between 20:30 to 21:00 hours.\n\n[6] \n  A \"stand-to count\" is defined in Commissioner's Directive 566-4 - Inmate Counts and Security Patrols as follows: \n \n \n \n \"A formal count of inmates in a standing position, facing the counting stall member to ensure facial identification is made except in cases where exemptions for medical conditions or physical limitations have been identified.\"\n\n[7] \n  The Bulletin was issued in response to the recommendations of a Coroner's Inquest and a report by the Officer of the Correctional Investigator into Deaths in Custody. The Jury recommendations at the Coroner's Inquest into the death of an inmate at the Collins Bay Institution included: \n \n \n \n \"1. It is recommended that correctional service of Canada (CSC) undertake a feasibility study on making the count when the cells are locked for the night a stand-to count. \n \n \n \n \"2. It is recommended that CSC issue a security bulletin reinforcing the existing requirement that ensures correctional staff confirm that an inmate is alive and breathing during a formal count and identify the manner by which such verification is made. \n \n \n \n \"3. It is recommended that every count be done by a correctional officer (CO) should verify that there is a living and breathing inmate in each occupied cell.\" \n \n \n \n The Office of the Correctional Investigator's report on Deaths in Custody also discussed the failure of correctional officers to ensure that inmates are still alive in their cells as an issue that frequently arose in a review of deaths in custody from 2001 to 2005.\n\n[8] \n  On July 10, 2009, Correctional Services Canada (CSC) issued a Security Branch Bulletin setting out a change with respect to stand-to counts at federal institutions. The Bulletin provided that stand-to counts must be conducted as follows: \n \n \n \n - For maximum, medium, and multi-level security institutions including women's institutions there will be two stand-to counts; \n \n \n \n - One of the two stand-to counts must be completed between the hours of 18:00 and 24:00\n\n[9] \n  Following receipt of the Bulletin, CSC staff at Mission Institution consulted with the Inmate Committee. On July 16, 2009, Acting Warden Corinne Justason announced that it had been determined that it would be least disruptive to incorporate the stand-to count into the unit lock up count at 22:40 hours.\n\n[10] \n  The Applicant filed a third level grievance on July 17, 2009 in response to the implementation of the 22:40 stand-to count raising a number of objections and requesting the 22:40 stand-to count be removed as it was arbitrary, capricious and without legal justification.\n\n[11] \n  The Applicant argued the Bulletin did not have the force of law as it was only a directive for administrative purposes. He submitted the CSC must consider the health factor of all elderly prisoners referencing section 87 of the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n  quoting: \"the Service shall take into consideration an offender's state of health and healthcare needs (a) in all decisions affecting the offender ...\" He likens the stand-to count as punishment by means of sleep deprivation. He declares CSC is in violation of section11 of the  \n Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \n  and raises an argument for procedural fairness invoking section 7 of the  \n Charter \n . He contends the stand-to count did not ensure the security of any prisoner, staff member or Canadian citizen. He alleged it was discrimination against him because of age. Finally, he claimed there was no consultation with inmates. In short, the Applicant raised a broad range of issues in grieving the 22:40 stand-to count.\n\n[12] \n  His grievance was denied by the Commissioner on October 27, 2009. \n \n \n \n Decision Under Review\n\n[13] \n  In the Offender Grievance Response dated October 27, 2009, the Commissioner responded to the Applicant's grievance, grouping the issues the Applicant raises into the four areas. Since the Applicant focuses on one issue, the impact of the 22:40 stand-to count on himself and elderly inmates, I have extracted and summarized the portions of the Commissioner's decision relevant to the issue the Applicant addresses in this judicial review.\n\n[14] \n   \n Issue One: Security Bulletin \n : the Commissioner stated the Bulletin's directive on a late night stand-to count is in response to the Corner's Inquest and the Death in Custody Report recommendations. As such the regulations are not punishment but part of an effort to save lives. Further, exemptions to the stand-to counts exist for medical conditions or physical limitations.\n\n[15] \n   \n Issue Two: Danger of Being Awoken \n : the Commissioner noted that Paragraph 11 of CD 566-4 provides that inmates with medical conditions or physical limitations deemed by the Chief of Health Services as unable to respond to, or perform a stand-to count request, are exempt. In such cases inmates must be awake and signal the staff member through an alternative means, normally a hand signal. There is no indication that the 22:40 count poses a significant health risk to the (inmate) population as a whole.\n\n[16] \n   \n Issue Three Targets the Elderly \n : the Commissioner wrote \"There is no indication why you believe the stand-to counts punish the elderly more than other offenders. There is nothing specific as to who must attend the stand-to as the Bulletin applies to all.\"\n\n[17] \n   \n Issue Four: Offender Participation \n : the Commissioner noted the Inmate Committee was consulted. A number of other times were considered and the 22:40 count was determined to be the most efficient and least disruptive. The morning unlock is 07:00 providing for 8 hours between counts.\n\n[18] \n  The Commissioner denied the Applicant's grievance in each of the above four issue categories addressing the whole of the subject matter of the grievance. The above extracted responses from those categories in the Commissioner's decision relate to the issue the Applicant raises in this judicial review. \n \n \n \n Legislation\n\n[19] \n  In respect of health and safety of inmates, the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n , 1992, c. 20 (the  \n CCRA \n ) provides: \n \n \n \n \"3. The purpose of the federal correctional system is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by \n \n \n \n (a) carrying out sentences imposed by courts through the safe and humane custody and supervision of offenders; and \n \n \n \n (b) assisting the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community as law-abiding citizens through the provision of programs in penitentiaries and in the community. \n \n \n \n \"4. The principles that shall guide the Service in achieving the purpose referred to in section 3 are \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (d) that the Service uses the least restrictive measures consistent with the protection of the public, staff members and offenders; \n \n \n \n (e) that offenders retain the rights and privileges of all members of society, except those rights and privileges that are necessarily removed or restricted as a consequence of the sentence; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (g) that correctional decisions be made in a forthright and fair manner, with access by the offender to an effective grievance procedure; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (h) that correctional policies, programs and practices respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and be responsive to the special needs of women and aboriginal peoples, as well as to the needs of other groups of offenders with special requirements; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n \"70. The Service shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that penitentiaries, the penitentiary environment, the living and working conditions of inmates and the working conditions of staff members are safe, healthful and free of practices that undermine a person's sense of personal dignity. \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n “87. The Service shall take into consideration an offender's state of health and health care needs \n \n \n \n (a) in all decisions affecting the offender, including decisions relating to placement, transfer, administrative segregation and disciplinary matters; and \n \n \n \n (b) in the preparation of the offender for release and the supervision of the offender.\" \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \"3. The correctional system aims to contribute to the maintenance of a just society, living in peace and security, on the one hand, by ensuring the execution of sentences through safe and humane custody and supervision measures, and on the other hand, by assisting, through appropriate programs in penitentiaries or in the community, in the rehabilitation of offenders and their social reintegration as law-abiding citizens. \n \n \n \n \"4. The Service is guided, in the execution of this mandate, by the following principles: \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (d) the measures necessary to protect the public, officers and offenders must be as least restrictive as possible; \n \n \n \n e) the offender continues to enjoy the rights and privileges recognized to every citizen, except those whose suppression or restriction is a necessary consequence of the sentence imposed on him; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n g) its decisions must be clear and fair, with offenders having access to effective grievance mechanisms; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n (h) its general orientation directives, programs and methods respect ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences, as well as between the sexes, and take into account the specific needs of women, indigenous people and other specific groups; \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n “70. The Service takes all useful measures to ensure that the living and working environment of detainees and the working conditions of officers are healthy, safe and free from practices detrimental to human dignity. \n \n \n \n . . . . . \n \n \n \n \"87. Decisions concerning an offender, in particular regarding his placement, his transfer, his administrative segregation or any disciplinary question, as well as the preparatory measures for his release and his supervision during that release, must take into account his state of health and the care he requires.\"\n\n[20] \n  The inmate grievance procedures are set out in the  \n Regulations Respecting Corrections and the Conditional Release and Detention of Offenders \n  (SOR/92-620) and are appended in part to this judgment. \n \n \n \n Issues\n\n[21] \n  The Applicant submits the Commissioner failed to address the central issue raised in the grievance, namely that the 22:40 stand-to count adversely and disproportionately affects the Applicant and other elderly inmates. The Applicant expresses the issue as whether the Commissioner improperly declined to exercise his jurisdiction.\n\n[22] \n  The Respondent submits the issues are whether the Applicant was denied procedural fairness and whether the Commissioner committed a reviewable error based on the standard of review.\n\n[23] \n  In my view, the issues in this judicial review are: \n \n \n \n a) Did the Commissioner fail to address the issue that the stand-to count adversely and disproportionately affected the Applicant and other elderly inmates thereby committing a breach of procedural fairness? \n \n \n \n b) Was the Commissioner's response reasonable? \n \n \n \n Standard of Review\n\n[24] \n  There are now only two standards of review: reasonableness and correctness. A detailed analysis of which standard to apply in a given case is not required if it has been determined in earlier jurisprudence.  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED.\n\n[25] \n  The standard of review for decisions made pursuant to the  \n Corrections and Conditional Release Act \n  was addressed by the Federal Court of Appeal in  \nFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED)\n\n[26] \n  In  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n , the Federal Court of Appeal held that correctness applied to questions of law which include issues of procedural fairness, whereas the reasonableness [standard] would apply to the application of legal principles to fact and the standard of patent unreasonableness (now reasonableness) would apply to findings of fact.   \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n  confirms the application of these standards in CSC grievance procedures: \n \n \n \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED\n\n[27] \n  Accordingly, the Commissioner's findings of fact and of mixed law and fact should be evaluated on a standard of reasonableness. In reviewing the impugned decisions against the reasonableness standard, the Court will consider whether these decisions under review fall within a range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in light of the facts and the law.  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED \n \n \n \n Analysis\n\n[28] \n  The Applicant submits that, given the purpose and role of the grievance process in maintaining a safe, humane and lawful correctional system, the grievance process should provide inmates with an opportunity to be heard and to seek redress in a forthright and fair manner.\n\n[29] \n  The Applicant submits that the Commissioner failed to address one of the central issues he raised in his grievance, namely that he and other elderly inmates were adversely and disproportionately affected by the 22:40 stand-to count, and that he was seeking some type of accommodation based on his age. Instead of addressing this issue of whether the elderly should be accommodated, the Applicant contends the Commissioner only looked at whether the elderly were specifically targeted.\n\n[30] \n  The Applicant submits that the Commissioner's failure to directly address the central issue in a grievance is a wrongful failure to exercise jurisdiction and statutory power. His specific submission on this point had been: \n \n \n \n \"There are many elderly prisoners including myself, who will be impacted by the unnecessary late count. Many times, because of the stress of the everyday prison life, I have been forced to retire early to bed in order to reduce the stress and anxiety and get enough rest for next strenuous day, and now I will be discriminated against because of my age.\"\n\n[31] \n  The Applicant now submits the core of his grievance was not whether the elderly were \"specifically targeted\" but whether the elderly should be accommodated. \n \n \n \n Did the Commissioner fail to address the issues raised by the Applicant?\n\n[32] \n  Although the Applicant now frames the issue of whether the elderly should be accommodated as the central issue, there is nothing in his third level grievance to suggest that this was the central issue. In his third level grievance, the Applicant raised myriad issues. He was not merely seeking accommodation for himself or for other elderly inmates in respect of the 22:40 stand-to count but rather was seeking to remove the 22:40 stand-to count altogether.\n\n[33] \n  In the response, the Commissioner explained the purpose of the stand-to count as being to save lives. The Commissioner also explained that the policy does not specifically target the elderly and that the Applicant did not provide any reason why he believed the stand-to counts punished the elderly more than other offenders.\n\n[34] \n  The Applicant, in his submissions, accepts the elderly are not targeted within the prison population since the Bulletin applies to all inmates. The Applicant now submits he is disproportionately affected by the late night stand-to count because of his age and the Commissioner failed to address his grievance in terms of adverse impact of the 22:40 stand-to count.\n\n[35] \n  In my view the Commissioner adequately addressed the Applicant's grievance about adverse impacts by: first, pointing out that the stand-to count was implemented in response to recommendations to save lives; second, noting there was no information that 22:40 stand-to count adversely affected other elderly inmates; and third, indicating that there is provision for exemptions from the stand-to count for medical and physical limitations. \n \n \n \n Was the Commissioner's response reasonable?\n\n[36] \n  The Applicant cites  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED to support his claim that an inmate has the right to a restful night's sleep without being unnecessarily awakened. In that case, the applicant inmate was purposely awakened two to three times a night. This is not the situation the Applicant now faces with the regularly scheduled stand-to count at 22:40.\n\n[37] \n  The Commissioner noted there is an eight hour span between the 22:40 stand-to count and the 7:00 morning unlock count. As such, I consider the Commissioner's finding that the 22:40 stand-to count allows for an appropriate period for sleep as reasonable.\n\n[38] \n  The Commissioner was mindful that medical exemptions are available to inmates who qualify and apply for them. At no point did the Applicant address the option of seeking of a personal exemption based on medical or physical limitations.\n\n[39] \n  The onus was on the Applicant to show some basis for his contention that the stand-to count posed a significant health risk to elderly inmates. While the Applicant may be personally unhappy with the time of the stand-to count, there was nothing to show other elderly inmates were negatively affected especially given the fact that an unbroken eight hour span is available for sleep and exemptions are available for medical or physical limitations. \n \n \n \n Conclusion\n\n[40] \n  I find the Commissioner's response to the Applicant's grievance adequately addressed the issue the Applicant now raises in this judicial review.\n\n[41] \n  I further find the Commissioner's response satisfies the reasonableness requirements of justification, transparency and intelligibility, and clearly falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes, as set out in  \n FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. The Commissioner's response to the Applicant's third-level grievance was reasonable.\n\n[42] \n  I dismiss this application for judicial review.\n\n[43] \n  I make no order for costs. \n \n \n \n JUDGMENT\n\n[44] THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that \n : \n \n \n \n 1. The application for judicial review is dismissed. \n \n \n \n 2. No order for costs is made. \n \n \n \n Application dismissed. \n \n \n \n Editor: E.

      "Crawshaw is 62 years old and typically goes to bed between 20:30 and 21:00.",
      "The Senior Deputy Commissioner denied Crawshaw's grievance.",
      "The stand-to count policy followed recommendations from a Coroner's Inquest and a report by the Officer of the Correctional Investigator regarding deaths in custody, aiming to verify inmates were alive during counts.",
      "Following the Bulletin, Mission Institution staff consulted with the Inmate Committee and decided to implement the stand-to count during the unit lock-up at 22:40.",
      "Crawshaw's grievance raised multiple objections, including claims of arbitrariness, lack of legal justification, and adverse impact on elderly inmates.",
      "Crawshaw argued the Bulletin was merely a directive and did not have the force of law, and that the stand-to count constituted sleep deprivation.",
      "The Commissioner responded that the stand-to count was implemented to save lives, that there was no evidence of adverse effects on other elderly inmates, and that exemptions were available for medical or physical limitations.",
