The visa officer found that Lam did not establish that he had received any training as a chef-cook and that he did not qualify for selection in that occupation. She also assessed him in the assistant manager restaurant category, but there was no demand in that occupational category. Lam sought judicial review of the visa officer's decision. \n \n \n \n The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, dismissed the application.

Leahy, for the applicant; \n \n Andrea M. Horton, for the respondent. \n \n \n \n Solicitors of Record: \n \n Timothy E. Leahy, North York, Ontario, for the applicant; \n \n Morris Rosenberg, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent. \n \n \n \n This application was heard at Toronto, Ontario, on August 24, 1998, before Rothstein, J., of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, who delivered the following judgment orally on August 25, 1998 with written release on August 31, 1998. \n \n \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[1] \n   \n Rothstein, J. \n : The applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada in the occupation of Chef-Cook, General (CCCDO6121-111). The visa officer found the applicant did not establish that he had received any training or experience as a Chef-Cook and that he did not qualify for selection in that occupation. She then assessed the applicant as an Assistant Manager Restaurant, an occupation for which he had training. However, there was no demand in that occupational category and he received zero units of assessment for the occupational factor.",
    "[2] \n  The application for permanent residence was denied without a personal interview. The applicant says he was entitled to a personal interview so that he could clarify his training and experience as a Chef-Cook for the visa officer. However, his application for permanent residence is clear. He applied to work as a Chef-Cook and there was nothing in the application or material he submitted that demonstrated training or experience in that occupation. In other words, there was nothing to clarify.",
    "[3] \n  At best, the applicant must be saying that his application is ambiguous and that when he included in his work history that he was a manager/trainee and assistant manager at McDonald's, that this placed the onus on the visa officer to inquire, through a personal interview, whether those occupations gave him training or experience as a Chef-Cook. However, if correct, this argument gives an advantage to applicants for permanent residence who file ambiguous applications. This cannot be correct.",
    "[4] \n  A visa officer may inquire further if he or she considers a further enquiry is warranted. Obviously, a visa officer cannot be wilfully blind in assessing an application and must act in good faith. However, there is no general obligation on a visa officer to make further inquiries when an application is ambiguous. The onus is on an applicant to file a clear application together with such supporting documentation as he or she considers advisable. The onus does not shift to the visa officer and there is no entitlement to a personal interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included.",
    "[5] \n  Notwithstanding that he obtained zero units in the occupational factor and was therefore not entitled to the issuance of an immigrant visa under s. 11(2) of the  \n Immigration Regulations \n , 1978 SOR/78-122 as amended, the applicant says that the visa officer erred in not exercising her discretion under s. 11(3) of the  \n Regulations \n  [see footnote 1]. Section 11(3) does not specify what is required to engage the visa officer's exercise of discretion under it. Nothing precludes the visa officer, on his or her own motion, from proceeding under s. 11(3) if he or she considers that it is warranted to do so. However, if an applicant wishes the visa officer to exercise discretion under s. 11(3), it would seem that some form of application would be required. While there is no prescribed wording to which an applicant must adhere, I would think the application would at least have to indicate some good reasons why a units of assessment determination would not reflect the chances of successful establishment in Canada by the applicant. There was no such application here.",
    "[6] \n  The applicant says he would not know that he must make an application to request s. 11(3) consideration until he is told his application fails under the units of assessment determination, and this is a reason for a personal interview. However, this argument is misplaced. The visa officer is not required to provide a piecemeal ongoing determination and advise the applicant at each stage, even if a personal interview is conducted. The units of assessment award is the conventional way in which visa officers determine whether an immigrant visa may be issued. Section 11(3) is exceptional. Where an applicant has reason to believe that he or she may be successfully established in Canada, irrespective of the units of assessment determination, he or she should apply for a determination under s. 11(3) setting forth relevant reasons. Otherwise, while the visa officer may do so on his or her own volition, there is no obligation on the visa officer to exercise a discretion under s. 11(3). As indicated, there was no application by the applicant for the exercise of discretion by the visa officer under s. 11(3) in this case.",
    "[7] \n  The judicial review is dismissed.",
    "[8] \n  Applicant's counsel proposes the following questions for certification: \n \n \n \n \"1. In making a 'preliminary' review of an application, where the officer does not find documentation sufficient to show that the applicant is qualified for the proposed 'intended occupation' may the officer summarily reject the application without having advised the applicant that s/he might not qualify to be assessed in the proposed 'intended occupation'? \n \n \n \n \"2. Where an officer concludes without having communicated to an applicant that s/he appears not to meet s. 81a selection criteria, does the officer err by not accessing its sister provision s. 11(3) before rejecting the case?\" \n \n \n \n Applicant's counsel has not indicated anything in the  \n Immigration Act \n  supporting the propositions that a visa officer is required to provide applicants with interim decisions to enable them to seek other remedies or obliging visa officers to exercise discretion under s. 11(3) of the  \n Regulations \n  on their own volition. In the absence of some reasonable indication by the applicant that either question is fairly arguable no question will be certified. \n \n \n \n Application dismissed. \n \n \n \n Editor: Janette Blue/saf \n \n \n \n Footnotes \n \n \n \n 1.\"11(2) Subject to subss.

        "He was entitled to a personal interview to clarify his training and experience as a Chef-Cook.",
        "The visa officer should have exercised her discretion under s. 11(3) of the Immigration Regulations to grant him a visa despite receiving zero units of assessment.",
        "The application was ambiguous regarding his training and experience, placing an onus on the visa officer to inquire further through a personal interview.",
        "He should have been advised that he might not qualify for assessment in his intended occupation before the application was summarily rejected.",
        "The visa officer should have considered s. 11(3) before rejecting the case."

      "Respondents": [
        "The applicant did not establish that he had received any training or experience as a Chef-Cook.",
        "There was no obligation to make further inquiries when the application was ambiguous; the onus is on the applicant to file a clear application.",
        "The applicant did not apply to have the visa officer exercise her discretion under s. 11(3) of the Immigration Regulations.",
        "There is no requirement for a visa officer to provide ongoing, piecemeal determinations or advise applicants at each stage.",
        "The visa officer is not obligated to exercise discretion under s. 11(3) unless an applicant specifically requests it and provides good reasons."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court dismissed the application for judicial review, finding no obligation for a visa officer to conduct a personal interview simply because an application is ambiguous. The court reasoned that the onus is on the applicant to submit a clear and complete application, not on the visa officer to seek clarification proactively.",
      "The court distinguished between a visa officer being 'wilfully blind' and having a general duty to inquire into ambiguous applications, holding that the latter does not exist. A visa officer is permitted to assess applications based on the information provided, and an applicant cannot rely on ambiguity to trigger an interview.",
      "Regarding section 11(3) of the Immigration Regulations, the court held that while a visa officer *may* exercise discretion under this section, there is no obligation to do so. The court emphasized that an applicant must specifically request consideration under section 11(3) and provide written reasons why the units of assessment do not accurately reflect their potential for successful establishment in Canada.",
      "The court rejected the applicant’s argument that he should have been informed of the possibility of a section 11(3) consideration after receiving a low assessment, stating that the visa officer is not required to provide ongoing, piecemeal determinations or advise applicants at every stage. Section 11(3) is an exceptional measure, and applicants must proactively pursue it.",
      "The court declined to certify the proposed questions for appeal, finding that the applicant had not demonstrated a 'fairly arguable question' based on any provision of the Immigration Act or Regulations. The questions relied on assumptions about obligations not supported by the statutory framework."

    "final_outcome": [
      "The application for judicial review was dismissed.",
      "No questions were certified for appeal."
