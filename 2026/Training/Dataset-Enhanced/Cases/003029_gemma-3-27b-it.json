Cintosun, for the applicant;\nAlexis Singer, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nBrian I. Cintosun, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicant;\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nO'Keefe, J.\n: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board), dated January 19, 2012, wherein the applicant was determined to be neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection as defined in subsection 97(1) of the Act.",
    "[2]\nThe applicant requests that the Board's decision be set aside and the application be referred back to the Board for redetermination by a different panel.\nBackground",
    "[3]\nThe applicant is a citizen of Turkey. He alleges that he was persecuted due to his participation in Kurdish political groups, including detention and torture by the Turkish police.",
    "[4]\nThe applicant is Kurdish and was marginalized growing up in Turkish society. He is a supporter of HADEP, known as the People's Democracy Party in English, which supports the cause of Kurdish nationalism.",
    "[5]\nIn 1995, he was detained for three days and subjected to being blindfolded and tortured. He was abused in the military and badly beaten.",
    "[6]\nIn 1999, he attended a HADEP press conference in Amasya and was detained for two days, accused of being a member of the Kurdistan People's Party (a terrorist organization) and subjected to torture.",
    "[7]\nIn 2009, he was attacked by Turkish nationalists and detained by police for two days. He was badly tortured, resulting in a chest wound.",
    "[8]\nIn 2010, he was detained by police, who attempted to recruit him as an informant. They repeatedly called him on his cell phone. This led to his decision to leave Turkey. He arrived in Canada via the United States on November 23, 2010 and his refugee claim was heard on January 18, 2012.\nBoard's Decision",
    "[9]\nThe Board rendered its decision on January 19, 2012. The Board began by summarizing the applicant's allegations.",
    "[10]\nThe Board considered credibility to be the determinative issue in this claim. The Board focused on a psychological report in evidence that referred to the applicant's religion as Alevi instead of Muslim and rejected the applicant's explanations that this was due to translation error or left in the doctor's template by error. The applicant was unable to produce any document proving his religion. Since many Alevi bring forward refugee claims in Canada, the Board found that the applicant had attempted to embellish his claim by telling the doctor he was Alevi and made a negative credibility finding.",
    "[11]\nThe Board also made a negative inference as to credibility based on the fact that the applicant had expressed no pro-Kurdish political opinions during his time in Canada and noted the lack of documentary evidence supporting his claim of supporting political parties or his detentions and beatings.",
    "[12]\nThe Board noted the applicant omitted mention of a 1995 attack in his Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, IMM 5611 and port of entry interview. The Board rejected the applicant's explanation that he had forgotten to mention this incident and made a negative credibility inference.",
    "[13]\nWith regards to the applicant's description of his 1999 torture, the applicant wrote in his narrative he had been beaten on the soles of his feet. The Board noted that only at the hearing did the applicant claim he was also beaten in the abdomen. The Board rejected his explanation that he had probably forgot and made a negative credibility inference.",
    "[14]\nThe Board found that the applicant had been inconsistent in describing whether it was during his 1999 or 2009 torture incidents that he had been stripped naked. The Board rejected his explanation that he had mixed up the two incidents and drew a negative credibility inference.",
    "[15]\nSimilarly, the Board pointed out that the applicant had written in his narrative that during the 2009 torture, he was beaten with wooden and iron sticks, but at the hearing only referred to iron sticks. The applicant was unable to explain this inconsistency.",
    "[16]\nThe Board identified other inconsistencies between the applicant's medical evidence and his oral evidence, including whether a scar from his 2009 torture was on his right side or his left side and whether his face had been beaten.",
    "[17]\nGiven the identified credibility concerns, the Board did not accept the applicant's claim that he was involved in pro-Kurdish agitation. Instead, the Board considered whether he would suffer persecution simply as a Kurdish person in Turkey and concluded Kurds face discrimination but not persecution. Therefore, the Board rejected the claim.\nIssues",
    "[18]\nThe applicant submits the following points at issue:\n1. Did the Board member err in law by failing to provide adequate and valid reasons for the negative credibility determination?\n2. Did the Board member err in law by making patently unreasonable inferences and relying on such to justify the negative decision?\n3. Did the Board member err in law by selectively referencing supporting documentary evidence while ignoring contradictory documentary evidence?\n4. Did the Board member err by simply misunderstanding or misapprehending central aspects of the applicant's claim?",
    "[19]\nI would rephrase the issues as follows:\n1. What is the appropriate standard of review?\n2. Did the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?\nApplicant's Written Submissions",
    "[20]\nThe applicant submits that in assessing credibility, the Board should not microscopically comb the evidence searching for trivial errors and inconsistencies. In this case, the Board made a number of negative inferences due to matters irrelevant or peripheral to the applicant's claim.",
    "[21]\nThe Board focused on the trivial matter of whether a certain scar was on the left or the right side of the applicant's chest, but ignored the doctor's evidence that various scars were consistent with torture described in the applicant's narrative.",
    "[22]\nThe Board made an issue of the applicant's religion, but the applicant has not claimed refugee protection based on religious persecution. The applicant has been consistent in identifying his religion as Muslim. The Board rejected the possibility that the doctor's report referred to Alevi religion as a template error by referring to \"several other concerns in regard to credibility\", an inadequate justification given the applicant had claimed to be Muslim in every other piece of evidence.",
    "[23]\nThe Board doubted the applicant's pro-Kurdish sentiments since he had not engaged in any political activity in Canada, an unreasonable finding given that a person arriving in a new country may easily have more pressing issues than political activity.",
    "[24]\nThe Board erred by considering the omitted details about the detention and torture of the applicant to be contradictions and embellishments. The thrust of the evidence regarding an altercation with ultra-nationalists was to showcase the brutal treatment by police of detained Kurdish demonstrators.",
    "[25]\nThe Board omitted important evidence such as the police's threats against the applicant in July 2010 that led to his fleeing Turkey and the letter from his wife indicating the police had visited his home five times since he had left Turkey. On this error alone, the decision should be quashed.\nRespondent's Written Submissions",
    "[26]\nThe respondent contends the applicant's evidence contained inconsistencies and embellishments, that the reasons provided were adequate and that the Board properly considered country conditions.",
    "[27]\nThe respondent argues the Board is owed deference on the weighing of evidence and drawing conclusions from evidence. Reasons should be read as a whole. The Board understood the facts of the claim and found insufficient evidence to support a positive finding.",
    "[28]\nCredibility findings are based on oral hearings and the Court should not interfere unless satisfied the Board based its conclusion on irrelevant considerations or ignored evidence. It was open to the Board to reject the applicant's explanation for the document identifying him as Alevi. It is possible that none of the Board's findings on their own would have resulted in a negative decision, but the Board's decision was based on a totality of the evidence. The Board is entitled to reject uncontradicted evidence if it is implausible.",
    "[29]\nRefugee status does not exist at large for anyone from a country with an unfavourable human rights record. The applicant failed to adduce evidence that he was personally threatened.\nAnalysis and Decision",
    "[30]\nIssue 1\nWhat is the appropriate standard of review?\nWhere previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).",
    "[31]\nIt is established jurisprudence that credibility findings, described as the \"heartland of the Board's jurisdiction\", are essentially pure findings of fact that are reviewable on a reasonableness standard (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 46; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 786 at paragraph 23). Similarly, the weighing of evidence and the interpretation and assessment of evidence are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1286 at paragraph 38).",
    "[32]\nIn reviewing the Board's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47; and\nCanada  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 59). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraph 59).",
    "[33]\nIssue 2\nDid the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?\nAs described above, deference is owed to the Board on credibility findings since they are based on oral hearings while the Court only considers a paper record. The Board is entitled to make findings based on implausibility (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2006] FCJ No 689).",
    "[34]\nHowever, not every kind of inconsistency or implausibility in the applicant's evidence will reasonably support the Board's negative credibility finding. This is particularly true of issues irrelevant or peripheral to the claim (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 37).",
    "[35]\nThe applicant's alleged torture is hardly irrelevant to his claim. That said, the Board's focus on minor details (such as whether the instrument of torture was made of wood or iron, which of four incidents of torture the applicant involved being stripped naked, whether the applicant was beaten on his face in addition to his abdomen and the location of a scar) is indicative of an overzealous approach that demands more of the applicant's memory than is reasonable, especially given his central allegation that he is a victim of repeated torture.",
    "[36]\nThe Board was right to be concerned that a key piece of the applicant's evidence, a medical report, referred to the applicant's religion as Alevi. The Board's rejection of the applicant's explanation for this inconsistency, however, was in part based on \"several other concerns in regard to credibility\". I would note that all of the applicant's other documents that mentioned religion stated that his religion was Islam or Muslim. Given this fact, it does not appear to me that the Board's conclusion that this would result in the applicant being not credible is reasonable.",
    "[37]\nWith respect to the Board's finding that the applicant did not take part in Kurdish activities in Canada that would support the Kurdish movement does not, in my view, make the applicant not credible.",
    "[38]\nWith respect to the location of the scar on the applicant's chest, the doctor states that the scar is on the right side of his chest. The applicant consistently stated it was on the left side of his chest. I cannot see how the applicant could control what the doctor wrote. On the facts of this case, I do not believe that this alone supports a non-credibility finding, particularly since the doctor also stated that, \"The scars that I observed are consistent with Mr. Dag's history of assault while in police detention in Turkey.\"",
    "[39]\nThere is also the further submission that the Board did not take into consideration the applicant's wife's letter that stated the police had visited her five times asking about her husband and that they had threatened her with detention. Also, the Board did not take into consideration the fact that the applicant's nephew was found to be a Convention refugee in September 2002. This information could be relevant to the claim but was not considered by the Board. This results in a reviewable error (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[40]\nFor the above reasons, the application for judicial review must be allowed and the matter referred back to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.",
    "[41]\nNeither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[42]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the Board is set aside and the matter is referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.\nANNEX\nRelevant Statutory Provisions\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\n25. (1) Subject to subsection (1.2), the Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who applies for permanent resident status and who is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada who applies for a permanent resident visa, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court with respect to any matter - a decision, determination or order made, a measure taken or a question raised - under this Act is begun by making an application for leave to the Court.\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; gold\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n25. (1) Subject to subsection (1.2), the Minister shall, on the application of a foreign national in Canada who is applying for permanent resident status and who is either inadmissible or failing to comply with this Act, and may, on the application of a foreign national outside Canada who is applying for a permanent resident visa, consider the case of that foreign national; he may grant him permanent resident status or waive all or part of the applicable criteria and obligations, if he considers that humanitarian considerations relating to the foreigner justify it, taking into account the best interests of the child directly affected.\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court of any action - decision, order, question or matter - taken under this Act is subject to the filing of an application for leave.\n96. A refugee within the meaning of the Convention - the refugee - is the person who, having a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his race, his religion, his nationality, his membership in a social group or his political opinions:\na) either is outside any country of which he or she is a national and cannot or, because of this fear, does not want to claim the protection of each of these countries;\nb) or, if he does not have a nationality and is outside the country in which he had his habitual residence, cannot and, because of this fear, does not want to return there.\n97. (1) A person to be protected is a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\n(a) or at risk, if there are serious grounds for believing so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is a request based on subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c. 27 (the Act) which seeks judicial review of the decision, dated January 19, 2012, by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) concluded that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96, nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of the Act."

(1) Judicial review by the Federal Court with respect to any matter - a decision, determination or order made, a measure taken or a question raised - under this Act is commenced by making an application for leave to the Court.\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n25. (1) Sous réserve du paragraphe (1.2), le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui demande le statut de résident permanent et qui soit est interdit de territoire, soit ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada qui demande un visa de résident permanent, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.\n72. (1) Le contrôle judiciaire par la Cour fédérale de toute mesure - décision, ordonnance, question ou affaire - prise dans le cadre de la présente loi est subordonné au dépôt d'une demande d'autorisation.\n96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:\na) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;\nb) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.\n97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:\na) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;\nb) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:\n(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,\n(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,\n(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,\n(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande fondée sur le paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, ch 27 (la Loi) qui vise le contrôle judiciaire de la décision, datée du 19 janvier 2012, par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) a conclut que le demandeur n'était ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention, au terme de l'article 96, ni une personne à protéger au terme du paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi.\n[2]\nLe demandeur demande que la décision de la Commission soit annulée et que l'affaire soit renvoyée à la Commission pour qu'un tribunal différemment constitué statue à nouveau sur l'affaire.\nContexte\n[3]\nLe demandeur est citoyen de la Turquie. Il affirme avoir été persécuté à cause de sa participation à des groupes politiques kurdes, y compris avoir été détenu et torturé par la police en Turquie.\n[4]\nLe demandeur est Kurde. Pendant sa jeunesse, il était marginalisé dans la société turque. Il soutient le HADEP (en français, le Parti de la démocratie du peuple), lequel défend la cause du nationalisme kurde.\n[5]\nEn 1995, le demandeur a été détenu durant trois jours, période pendant laquelle on lui a bandé les yeux et on l'a torturé. Il a été maltraité par les militaires et battu sauvagement.\n[6]\nEn 1999, le demandeur a assisté à une conférence de presse du HADEP à Amasya. Il a ensuite été détenu durant deux jours, accusé d'être membre du Parti des travailleurs du Kurdistan (PKK), une organisation terroriste, et torturé.\n[7]\nEn 2009, le demandeur a été attaqué par des nationalistes turcs et détenu par la police durant deux jours. Il a été torturé gravement, ce qui lui a causé une blessure à la poitrine.\n[8]\nEn 2010, le demandeur a été détenu par la police, qui a tenté de le recruter comme indicateur. Il a ensuite reçu de nombreux appels de la police sur son téléphone cellulaire. Cela a poussé le demandeur à décider de quitter la Turquie. Il est arrivé au Canada, via les États-Unis, le 23 novembre 2010. Sa demande d'asile a été entendue le 18 janvier 2012.\nDécision de la Commission\n[9]\nLa Commission a rendu sa décision le 19 janvier 2012. Elle a commencé par résumer les allégations du demandeur.\n[10]\nLa Commission a jugé que la crédibilité était la question déterminante pour la demande d'asile. La Commission a mis l'accent sur un rapport psychologique qui avait été déposé en preuve, rapport selon lequel le demandeur était de confession aléviste et non musulmane. Elle a rejeté l'explication du demandeur, selon qui cette différence découlait d'une erreur de traduction ou de l'oubli de modifier le modèle de rapport utilisé par le médecin. Le demandeur n'a pu présenter aucun document pour attester son appartenance religieuse. La Commission a conclu que, comme de nombreux alévis présentent des demandes d'asile au Canada, le demandeur avait cherché à embellir sa demande en disant au médecin qu'il était alévi. La Commission a tiré une conclusion négative à l'égard de la crédibilité du demandeur.\n[11]\nLe Commission a aussi tiré une conclusion négative quant à la crédibilité du demandeur parce que le demandeur n'avait exprimé aucune opinion politique pro-kurde pendant son séjour au Canada. Elle a aussi souligné que le demandeur n'avait présenté aucune preuve documentaire relativement à son appui à des partis politiques ou au fait qu'il avait été détenu et battu.\n[12]\nLa Commission a noté que le demandeur n'avait pas mentionné l'attaque dont il aurait été victime en 1995, que ce soit dans le récit fait dans sa Fiche de renseignements personnels (FRP), dans le formulaire 5611 ou lors de l'entrevue au point d'entrée. La Commission a rejeté l'explication du demandeur - il a dit avoir oublié de mentionner l'incident - et elle a tiré une conclusion négative sur le plan de la crédibilité.\n[13]\nIl a aussi été question de la manière dont le demandeur a décrit les tortures qu'il avait subies en 1999. Dans son récit, le demandeur a écrit qu'il avait été frappé sur la plante des pieds. La Commission a souligné que, avant l'audience, le demandeur n'avait jamais affirmé avoir aussi été frappé à l'abdomen. La Commission a rejeté l'explication du demandeur - selon qui il s'agissait probablement d'un oubli - et elle a tiré une conclusion négative quant à la crédibilité.\n[14]\nLe Commission a conclu que le demandeur avait donné des explications contradictoires quant à l'incident de torture, celui de 1999 ou celui de 2009, lors duquel il avait été déshabillé. La Commission a rejeté l'explication du demandeur - qui soutient avoir confondu les deux incidents - et elle a tiré une conclusion négative sur la crédibilité du demandeur.\n[15]\nDans le même ordre d'idées, la Commission a fait remarquer que, dans son récit, le demandeur avait allégué avoir été battu avec des bâtons de bois et des barres de fer lors de l'incident de torture de 2009, mais que, à l'audience, il avait seulement mentionné les barres de fer. Le demandeur n'a pas su expliquer ces divergences.\n[16]\nLa Commission a relevé d'autres contradictions entre les preuves médicales présentées par le demandeur et le témoignage oral de ce dernier, notamment quant à savoir si la cicatrice causée par l'incident de torture de 2009 se trouvait sur le côté droit ou gauche de son corps et s'il avait été frappé au visage.\n[17]\nCompte tenu des doutes soulevés quant à la crédibilité, la Commission a rejeté l'allégation du demandeur selon laquelle il participait à des activités d'agitation pro-kurde. La Commission s'est plutôt demandé si le demandeur, à titre de simple Kurde, risquait d'être persécuté en Turquie. Elle a conclu que les Kurdes y sont victimes de discrimination, mais pas de persécution. La Commission a donc rejeté la demande d'asile.\nQuestions en litige\n[18]\nSelon le demandeur, les questions en litige sont les suivantes:\n1. Le commissaire a-t-il commis une erreur de droit en ne fournissant pas de motifs suffisants ou valides pour justifier ses conclusions négatives quant à la crédibilité du demandeur?\n2. Le commissaire a-t-il commis une erreur de droit en tirant des conclusions manifestement déraisonnables et en se fondant sur ces conclusions pour motiver sa décision négative?\n3. Le commissaire a-t-il commis une erreur de droit en citant certains éléments de preuve documentaire tout en faisant abstraction des éléments de preuve documentaire contradictoires?\n4. Le commissaire a-t-il commis une erreur du fait d'une simple mauvaise compréhension ou interprétation des éléments essentiels de la demande d'asile du demandeur?\n[19]\nÀ mon avis, les questions en litige doivent être formulées de la manière suivante:\n1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle appropriée?\n2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en rejetant la demande d'asile du demandeur?\nObservations écrites du demandeur\n[20]\nLe demandeur soutient que, lorsque la Commission évalue la crédibilité, elle ne doit pas scruter la preuve à la loupe afin de découvrir des erreurs ou des incohérences triviales. En l'espèce, la Commission a tiré plusieurs conclusions défavorables sur le fondement de facteurs non pertinents ou accessoires à l'égard de la demande d'asile du demandeur.\n[21]\nLe Commission a accordé de l'importance à la question triviale de savoir si une cicatrice se trouvait sur le côté droit ou le côté gauche de la poitrine du demandeur, mais elle n'a pas tenu compte du témoignage du médecin voulant que les diverses cicatrices étaient compatibles avec les tortures décrites par le demandeur dans son récit.\n[22]\nLa Commission a soulevé la question de l'appartenance religieuse du demandeur, mais ce dernier n'a pas demandé le statut de réfugié sur le fondement d'une persécution religieuse. Le demandeur s'est toujours décrit comme un musulman. La Commission a rejeté la possibilité que le rapport du médecin ait indiqué que le demandeur était de confession aléviste à cause d'un modèle erroné, en raison  de plusieurs autres préoccupations concernant la crédibilité  - il s'agit là d'une justification insuffisante, car le demandeur a affirmé être musulman dans tous les autres éléments de preuve.\n[23]\nLa Commission a mis en doute les sentiments pro-kurdes du demandeur parce qu'il n'avait participé à aucune activité politique au Canada, une conclusion déraisonnable compte tenu du fait qu'une personne nouvellement arrivée dans un pays peut très bien avoir des choses plus importantes à faire que de participer à des activités politiques.\n[24]\nLa Commission a commis une erreur en considérant que les détails omis par le demandeur relativement à sa détention et à sa torture étaient des contradictions et des exagérations. Les éléments de preuve portant sur l'altercation avec des ultra-nationalistes visaient essentiellement à démontrer la manière brutale dont la police traitait les manifestants kurdes qu'elle détenait.\n[25]\nLa Commission a fait abstraction d'éléments de preuve importants, notamment les menaces proférées par la police à l'endroit du demandeur en juillet 2010 - menaces qui ont mené le demandeur à fuir la Turquie - et la lettre de l'épouse du demandeur qui indique que la police s'était rendue au domicile de ce dernier à cinq reprises depuis son départ de la Turquie. Cette erreur justifie à elle seule l'annulation de la décision.\nObservations écrites du défendeur\n[26]\nLe défendeur soutient que le témoignage du demandeur comportait des incohérences et des exagérations, que les motifs fournis par la Commission étaient suffisants et que la Commission a correctement analysé les conditions dans le pays d'origine.\n[27]\nSelon le défendeur, la Cour doit faire preuve de déférence à l'égard de la Commission en ce qui a trait à la pondération de la preuve et aux conclusions tirées de la preuve. Les motifs doivent être analysés dans leur ensemble. La Commission a compris les faits en cause dans la demande et elle a estimé que la preuve était insuffisante pour étayer une conclusion favorable.\n[28]\nLes conclusions sur la crédibilité sont fondées sur les audiences, et la Cour ne doit pas intervenir à moins d'être convaincue que la Commission a fondé ses conclusions sur des considérations non pertinentes ou des éléments de preuve non pris en compte. Il était loisible à la Commission de rejeter l'explication du demandeur au sujet du document l'identifiant comme un alévi. Il se peut que, prise individuellement, aucune des conclusions de la Commission n'ait entraîné une décision défavorable, mais la décision de la Commission reposait sur l'ensemble des éléments de preuve. La Commission a le droit de rejeter un élément de preuve non contredit s'il est invraisemblable.\n[29]\nLe statut de réfugié n'est pas ouvert à toute personne provenant d'un pays ayant un bilan négatif en matière de droits de la personne. Le demandeur n'a présenté aucun élément de preuve démontrant qu'il était menacé personnellement.\nAnalyse et décision\n[30]\nQuestion 1\nQuelle est la norme de contrôle appropriée?\nLorsque la jurisprudence établit déjà quelle norme de contrôle s'applique à une question donnée, la cour chargée du contrôle peut adopter cette norme (voir l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 57).\n[31]\nIl est de jurisprudence constante que les appréciations de la crédibilité, décrites comme  l'essentiel de la compétence de la Commission ,sont essentiellement de pures conclusions de fait et sont assujetties à la norme de la raisonnabilité (voir la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 46, et la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 786, au paragraphe 23). De même, l'importance relative attribuée à la preuve, l'interprétation et l'appréciation de cette preuve sont des questions qui doivent être examinées selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 1286, au paragraphe 38).\n[32]\nLorsqu'elle contrôle une décision de la Commission suivant la norme de la raisonnabilité, la Cour doit seulement intervenir si elle conclut que cette décision ne répond pas aux principes de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité et qu'elle n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables compte tenu de la preuve en cause (voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et l'arrêt Khosa, précité, au paragraphe 59). Comme l'a affirmé la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la cour de révision ne peut remplacer la décision par l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable et elle n'a pas le rôle de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve (paragraphe 59).\n[33]\nQuestion 2\nLa Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en rejetant la demande d'asile du demandeur?\nComme il est expliqué ci-dessus, la Cour doit faire preuve de déférence à l'égard des conclusions de la Commission en matière de crédibilité, car la Commission se fonde sur l'audience, alors que la Cour ne se fonde que sur le dossier écrit. La Commission peut tirer des conclusions fondées sur des invraisemblances (voir la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 689, au paragraphe 37).\n[34]\nCependant, ce ne sont pas tous les types d'incohérence ou d'invraisemblance contenue dans la preuve présentée par le demandeur qui justifieront raisonnablement que la Commission tire des conclusions défavorables sur la crédibilité, à plus forte raison lorsqu'il s'agit d'éléments qui ne sont pas pertinents ou qui sont accessoires à la demande (voir la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 37).\n[35]\nOn peut difficilement soutenir que les tortures dont le demandeur affirme avoir été victime ne sont pas pertinentes à l'égard de sa demande. Cela étant dit, l'importance que la Commission a accordée à des détails secondaires (par exemple, la question de savoir si l'instrument de torture était fait de bois ou de fer, lors de quel des quatre incidents de torture le demandeur avait été déshabillé, si le demandeur avait aussi été frappé au visage ou seulement sur l'abdomen et l'emplacement d'une cicatrice) révèle un zèle excessif qui impose des exigences déraisonnables à la faculté de mémoire du demandeur, surtout eu égard à son allégation fondamentale voulant qu'il ait été torturé à répétition.\n[36]\nLa Commission avait raison d'être préoccupée par le fait qu'un élément de preuve clé présenté par le demandeur, un rapport médical, indiquait que le demandeur était de confession aléviste. Toutefois, pour rejeter l'explication du demandeur quant à cette incohérence, la Commission a notamment invoqué  plusieurs autres préoccupations concernant la crédibilité . Je tiens à souligner que tous les autres documents présentés par le demandeur indiquaient que sa religion est l'Islam ou qu'il est de confession musulmane. Par conséquent, j'estime que la Commission a tiré une conclusion déraisonnable en jugeant que le demandeur n'était pas crédible à cause de cette incohérence.\n[37]\nPour ce qui est de la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle le demandeur n'avait pas participé à des activités pro-kurdes au Canada afin d'appuyer la cause kurde, je suis d'avis que cela n'empêche pas le demandeur d'être crédible.\n[38]\nPour ce qui est de l'emplacement de la cicatrice sur la poitrine du demandeur, le médecin affirme qu'elle se trouve sur le côté droit. Le demandeur a systématiquement affirmé que la cicatrice se trouve sur le côté gauche de sa poitrine. Je ne vois pas comment le demandeur aurait pu contrôler ce que le médecin a inscrit dans son rapport. Compte tenu de l'ensemble des faits en cause, je ne crois pas que cet élément étaye à lui seul une conclusion d'absence de crédibilité, d'autant plus que le médecin a affirmé que [traduction]  [l] es cicatrices que j'ai observées sont compatibles avec le récit de M. Dag selon lequel il avait été agressé lorsqu'il était détenu par la police en Turquie .\n[39]\nFinalement, il reste à aborder l'argument voulant que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte de la lettre dans laquelle l'épouse du demandeur expliquait que la police était venue la voir à cinq reprises pour lui poser des questions au sujet de son époux et l'avait menacé de la mettre en détention. De plus, la Commission a fait abstraction du fait que le neveu du demandeur avait été reconnu comme réfugié au sens de la Convention en septembre 2002. Ce fait pouvait être pertinent à l'égard de la demande, mais la Commission n'en a pas tenu compte. Cela constitue une erreur susceptible de contrôle (voir la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[40]\nPour les motifs exposés ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être accueillie et l'affaire doit être renvoyée à la Commission pour qu'un tribunal différemment constitué statue à nouveau sur l'affaire.\n[41]\nAucune des parties n'a souhaité me soumettre une question grave de portée générale en vue de sa certification.\nJUGEMENT\n[42]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, que la décision de la Commission est annulée et que l'affaire est renvoyée à la Commission pour qu'un tribunal différemment constitué statue à nouveau sur l'affaire.\nANNEXE\nDispositions légales pertinentes\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, ch 27\n25.

Cintosun, for the applicant;\nAlexis Singer, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nBrian I. Cintosun, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicant;\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nO'Keefe, J.\n: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board), dated January 19, 2012, wherein the applicant was determined to be neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection as defined in subsection 97(1) of the Act.\n\n[2]\nThe applicant requests that the Board's decision be set aside and the application be referred back to the Board for redetermination by a different panel.\nBackground\n\n[3]\nThe applicant is a citizen of Turkey. He alleges that he was persecuted due to his participation in Kurdish political groups, including detention and torture by the Turkish police.\n\n[4]\nThe applicant is Kurdish and was marginalized growing up in Turkish society. He is a supporter of HADEP, known as the People's Democracy Party in English, which supports the cause of Kurdish nationalism.\n\n[5]\nIn 1995, he was detained for three days and subjected to being blindfolded and tortured. He was abused in the military and badly beaten.\n\n[6]\nIn 1999, he attended a HADEP press conference in Amasya and was detained for two days, accused of being a member of the Kurdistan People's Party (a terrorist organization) and subjected to torture.\n\n[7]\nIn 2009, he was attacked by Turkish nationalists and detained by police for two days. He was badly tortured, resulting in a chest wound.\n\n[8]\nIn 2010, he was detained by police, who attempted to recruit him as an informant. They repeatedly called him on his cell phone. This led to his decision to leave Turkey. He arrived in Canada via the United States on November 23, 2010 and his refugee claim was heard on January 18, 2012.\nBoard's Decision\n\n[9]\nThe Board rendered its decision on January 19, 2012. The Board began by summarizing the applicant's allegations.\n\n[10]\nThe Board considered credibility to be the determinative issue in this claim. The Board focused on a psychological report in evidence that referred to the applicant's religion as Alevi instead of Muslim and rejected the applicant's explanations that this was due to translation error or left in the doctor's template by error. The applicant was unable to produce any document proving his religion. Since many Alevi bring forward refugee claims in Canada, the Board found that the applicant had attempted to embellish his claim by telling the doctor he was Alevi and made a negative credibility finding.\n\n[11]\nThe Board also made a negative inference as to credibility based on the fact that the applicant had expressed no pro-Kurdish political opinions during his time in Canada and noted the lack of documentary evidence supporting his claim of supporting political parties or his detentions and beatings.\n\n[12]\nThe Board noted the applicant omitted mention of a 1995 attack in his Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, IMM 5611 and port of entry interview. The Board rejected the applicant's explanation that he had forgotten to mention this incident and made a negative credibility inference.\n\n[13]\nWith regards to the applicant's description of his 1999 torture, the applicant wrote in his narrative he had been beaten on the soles of his feet. The Board noted that only at the hearing did the applicant claim he was also beaten in the abdomen. The Board rejected his explanation that he had probably forgot and made a negative credibility inference.\n\n[14]\nThe Board found that the applicant had been inconsistent in describing whether it was during his 1999 or 2009 torture incidents that he had been stripped naked. The Board rejected his explanation that he had mixed up the two incidents and drew a negative credibility inference.\n\n[15]\nSimilarly, the Board pointed out that the applicant had written in his narrative that during the 2009 torture, he was beaten with wooden and iron sticks, but at the hearing only referred to iron sticks. The applicant was unable to explain this inconsistency.\n\n[16]\nThe Board identified other inconsistencies between the applicant's medical evidence and his oral evidence, including whether a scar from his 2009 torture was on his right side or his left side and whether his face had been beaten.\n\n[17]\nGiven the identified credibility concerns, the Board did not accept the applicant's claim that he was involved in pro-Kurdish agitation. Instead, the Board considered whether he would suffer persecution simply as a Kurdish person in Turkey and concluded Kurds face discrimination but not persecution. Therefore, the Board rejected the claim.\nIssues\n\n[18]\nThe applicant submits the following points at issue:\n1. Did the Board member err in law by failing to provide adequate and valid reasons for the negative credibility determination?\n2. Did the Board member err in law by making patently unreasonable inferences and relying on such to justify the negative decision?\n3. Did the Board member err in law by selectively referencing supporting documentary evidence while ignoring contradictory documentary evidence?\n4. Did the Board member err by simply misunderstanding or misapprehending central aspects of the applicant's claim?\n\n[19]\nI would rephrase the issues as follows:\n1. What is the appropriate standard of review?\n2. Did the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?\nApplicant's Written Submissions\n\n[20]\nThe applicant submits that in assessing credibility, the Board should not microscopically comb the evidence searching for trivial errors and inconsistencies. In this case, the Board made a number of negative inferences due to matters irrelevant or peripheral to the applicant's claim.\n\n[21]\nThe Board focused on the trivial matter of whether a certain scar was on the left or the right side of the applicant's chest, but ignored the doctor's evidence that various scars were consistent with torture described in the applicant's narrative.\n\n[22]\nThe Board made an issue of the applicant's religion, but the applicant has not claimed refugee protection based on religious persecution. The applicant has been consistent in identifying his religion as Muslim. The Board rejected the possibility that the doctor's report referred to Alevi religion as a template error by referring to \"several other concerns in regard to credibility\", an inadequate justification given the applicant had claimed to be Muslim in every other piece of evidence.\n\n[23]\nThe Board doubted the applicant's pro-Kurdish sentiments since he had not engaged in any political activity in Canada, an unreasonable finding given that a person arriving in a new country may easily have more pressing issues than political activity.\n\n[24]\nThe Board erred by considering the omitted details about the detention and torture of the applicant to be contradictions and embellishments. The thrust of the evidence regarding an altercation with ultra-nationalists was to showcase the brutal treatment by police of detained Kurdish demonstrators.\n\n[25]\nThe Board omitted important evidence such as the police's threats against the applicant in July 2010 that led to his fleeing Turkey and the letter from his wife indicating the police had visited his home five times since he had left Turkey. On this error alone, the decision should be quashed.\nRespondent's Written Submissions\n\n[26]\nThe respondent contends the applicant's evidence contained inconsistencies and embellishments, that the reasons provided were adequate and that the Board properly considered country conditions.\n\n[27]\nThe respondent argues the Board is owed deference on the weighing of evidence and drawing conclusions from evidence. Reasons should be read as a whole. The Board understood the facts of the claim and found insufficient evidence to support a positive finding.\n\n[28]\nCredibility findings are based on oral hearings and the Court should not interfere unless satisfied the Board based its conclusion on irrelevant considerations or ignored evidence. It was open to the Board to reject the applicant's explanation for the document identifying him as Alevi. It is possible that none of the Board's findings on their own would have resulted in a negative decision, but the Board's decision was based on a totality of the evidence. The Board is entitled to reject uncontradicted evidence if it is implausible.\n\n[29]\nRefugee status does not exist at large for anyone from a country with an unfavourable human rights record. The applicant failed to adduce evidence that he was personally threatened.\nAnalysis and Decision\n\n[30]\nIssue 1\nWhat is the appropriate standard of review?\nWhere previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).\n\n[31]\nIt is established jurisprudence that credibility findings, described as the \"heartland of the Board's jurisdiction\", are essentially pure findings of fact that are reviewable on a reasonableness standard (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 46; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 786 at paragraph 23). Similarly, the weighing of evidence and the interpretation and assessment of evidence are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1286 at paragraph 38).\n\n[32]\nIn reviewing the Board's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47; and\nCanada  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 59). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraph 59).\n\n[33]\nIssue 2\nDid the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?\nAs described above, deference is owed to the Board on credibility findings since they are based on oral hearings while the Court only considers a paper record. The Board is entitled to make findings based on implausibility (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2006] FCJ No 689).\n\n[34]\nHowever, not every kind of inconsistency or implausibility in the applicant's evidence will reasonably support the Board's negative credibility finding. This is particularly true of issues irrelevant or peripheral to the claim (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 37).\n\n[35]\nThe applicant's alleged torture is hardly irrelevant to his claim. That said, the Board's focus on minor details (such as whether the instrument of torture was made of wood or iron, which of four incidents of torture the applicant involved being stripped naked, whether the applicant was beaten on his face in addition to his abdomen and the location of a scar) is indicative of an overzealous approach that demands more of the applicant's memory than is reasonable, especially given his central allegation that he is a victim of repeated torture.\n\n[36]\nThe Board was right to be concerned that a key piece of the applicant's evidence, a medical report, referred to the applicant's religion as Alevi. The Board's rejection of the applicant's explanation for this inconsistency, however, was in part based on \"several other concerns in regard to credibility\". I would note that all of the applicant's other documents that mentioned religion stated that his religion was Islam or Muslim. Given this fact, it does not appear to me that the Board's conclusion that this would result in the applicant being not credible is reasonable.\n\n[37]\nWith respect to the Board's finding that the applicant did not take part in Kurdish activities in Canada that would support the Kurdish movement does not, in my view, make the applicant not credible.\n\n[38]\nWith respect to the location of the scar on the applicant's chest, the doctor states that the scar is on the right side of his chest. The applicant consistently stated it was on the left side of his chest. I cannot see how the applicant could control what the doctor wrote. On the facts of this case, I do not believe that this alone supports a non-credibility finding, particularly since the doctor also stated that, \"The scars that I observed are consistent with Mr. Dag's history of assault while in police detention in Turkey.\"\n\n[39]\nThere is also the further submission that the Board did not take into consideration the applicant's wife's letter that stated the police had visited her five times asking about her husband and that they had threatened her with detention. Also, the Board did not take into consideration the fact that the applicant's nephew was found to be a Convention refugee in September 2002. This information could be relevant to the claim but was not considered by the Board. This results in a reviewable error (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[40]\nFor the above reasons, the application for judicial review must be allowed and the matter referred back to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.\n\n[41]\nNeither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[42]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the Board is set aside and the matter is referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.\nANNEX\nRelevant Statutory Provisions\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\n25. (1) Subject to subsection (1.2), the Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who applies for permanent resident status and who is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada who applies for a permanent resident visa, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court with respect to any matter - a decision, determination or order made, a measure taken or a question raised - under this Act is begun by making an application for leave to the Court.\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; gold\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n25. (1) Subject to subsection (1.2), the Minister shall, on the application of a foreign national in Canada who is applying for permanent resident status and who is either inadmissible or failing to comply with this Act, and may, on the application of a foreign national outside Canada who is applying for a permanent resident visa, consider the case of that foreign national; he may grant him permanent resident status or waive all or part of the applicable criteria and obligations, if he considers that humanitarian considerations relating to the foreigner justify it, taking into account the best interests of the child directly affected.\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court of any action - decision, order, question or matter - taken under this Act is subject to the filing of an application for leave.\n96. A refugee within the meaning of the Convention - the refugee - is the person who, having a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his race, his religion, his nationality, his membership in a social group or his political opinions:\na) either is outside any country of which he or she is a national and cannot or, because of this fear, does not want to claim the protection of each of these countries;\nb) or, if he does not have a nationality and is outside the country in which he had his habitual residence, cannot and, because of this fear, does not want to return there.\n97. (1) A person to be protected is a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\n(a) or at risk, if there are serious grounds for believing so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is a request based on subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c. 27 (the Act) which seeks judicial review of the decision, dated January 19, 2012, by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) concluded that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96, nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of the Act.",
