Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nDeputy Judge Frenette\n: This is an appeal brought under subsection 14(5) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, L.R.C. (1985), c. C-29, (the Act) against the decision rendered on May 30, 2008 by Citizenship Judge Gordana Caricevic-Rakovich, refusing the application for Canadian citizenship presented by the applicant because the proof he produced did not demonstrate that he met the residency requirements provided for in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act.\nThe factual context",
    "[2]\nThe applicant was born on March 6, 1969, in Morocco. He arrived in Canada on April 12, 2001, with his wife and his three children. On August 23, 2004, he filed his application for Canadian citizenship.",
    "[3]\nThe applicable reference period of four years or 1,460 days preceding his application for citizenship ran from August 23, 2000, to August 23, 2004 (the reference period).",
    "[4]\nThe applicant says that he was absent from Canada for a total of 90 days following his arrival in Canada on April 12, 2001. The 90 days consisted of two trips to Morocco: a 77-day trip to visit his family and a 13-day trip for vacation.",
    "[5]\nIn November 2004, he decided to return to France to complete his doctorate in business administration and economics. He brought his wife and children with him to France but, at the end of 2004, she and the children returned to Morocco to live.",
    "[6]\nThe applicant had acquired a house in Notre-Dame-de-la-Merci, in the province of Quebec, in 1998. He contends that they were established in the local community between 2001 and 2004.",
    "[7]\nOn February 5, 2008, the applicant appeared before the citizenship judge after being invited to an interview.",
    "[8]\nAt paragraph 45 of his affidavit dated August 22, 2008, signed at Rabat, Morocco, the applicant wrote:\n[translation] At the interview, I did not understand the substance and the scope of some of the questions the citizenship judge asked; she was looking for certain information that was very specific to the questions and I had specific answers, but they slipped my mind because of stress.",
    "[9]\nThe Canadian notices of assessment for 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 show that the applicant had no taxable income in Canada during those years.\nImpugned decision",
    "[10]\nIn her decision dated May 30, 2008, the citizenship judge rejected the applicant's application for citizenship. She explained that between April 12, 2001, and August 23, 2004, the applicant had accumulated 1,138 days of physical presence in Canada; he had spent 90 days outside Canada during the same period. She analyzed the evidence presented by the applicant, i.e., the acquisition of a house, his tax returns, bank statements and telephone bills. She considered the fact that, despite the applicant's submissions that he was an economist/independent consultant, he had not provided any tangible evidence of his work activities during his stay in Canada.",
    "[11]\nThe bank account that was opened in the name of the applicant and one Jean Lavoie shows few transactions. The telephone bill statements indicate long periods without any telephone communications. The citizenship judge also considered the lack of taxable income during the four years involved.",
    "[12]\nIn her decision, the judge concluded that the applicant had not met the residence conditions in Canada, as required under paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the Act.\nStandard of review",
    "[13]\nThe applicable standard of review for decisions of a citizenship judge concerning an applicant's residence, which is a question of fact or mixed law and fact, is reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[14]\nA citizenship judge's assessment on the issue of adequate knowledge of Canada is a purely factual question for which the Court should show considerable deference (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[15]\nThe applicant's explanation regarding his answers is not convincing.\nApplicable legislation",
    "[16]\nParagraph 5(1)(c) of the Act reads as follows:\n5(1) The Minister grants citizenship to any person who:\n[. . .]\n(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and has, in the four years preceding the date of his application, resided in Canada for at least three years in total, the duration of his residence being calculated as follows:\n(i) one-half day for each day of residence in Canada before admission as a permanent resident;\n(ii) one day for each day of residence in Canada after admission as a permanent resident;\n5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n[. . .]\n(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;",
    "[17]\nArticle 15 of\nCitizenship Regulations, 1993\n, SOR/93-246, reads as follows:\n15. A person has sufficient knowledge of Canada and the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship if he or she generally understands simple oral questions based on information contained in self-study materials approved by the Minister and presented to citizenship applicants and can answer them correctly. The questions cover:\na) the right to vote in federal, provincial and municipal elections and the right to run for elected office;\nb) formalities related to the electoral census and voting;\n(c) one of the following subjects, at the discretion of the person responsible for interviewing the applicant:\n(i) the main characteristics of the social and cultural history of Canada,\n(ii) the main characteristics of the political history of Canada,\n(iii) the main characteristics of the physical and political geography of Canada,\n(iv) the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).\n15. The criteria for determining whether a person has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship are that the person has a general understanding of and can answer correctly simple oral questions based on the information contained in self-instructional materials approved by the Minister and presented to applicants for the grant of citizenship respecting\n(a) the right to vote in federal, provincial and municipal elections and the right to run for elected office;\n(b) enumerating and voting procedures related to elections; and\n(c) one of the following topics, to be chosen by the person questioning the applicant, namely,\n(i) the chief characteristics of Canadian social and cultural history,\n(ii) the chief characteristics of Canadian political history,\n(iii) the chief characteristics of Canadian physical and political geography, or\n(iv) the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).",
    "[18]\nThe questions in paragraphs 15(a) and (b) are mandatory (\nWang\n, above, at paragraph 9).",
    "[19]\nThe onus is on the applicant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the conditions required by the Act have been satisfied (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nKoo (Re)\n, [1993] 1 F.C. 286).",
    "[20]\nResidence has the ordinary meaning of the word (\nIn re the Citizenship Law and in re Papadogiorgakis\n, [1978] 2 F.C. 208;\nKoo (Re)\n, [1993] 1 F.C. 286).",
    "[21]\nIt is open to the citizenship judge to choose one of the methods suggested in the jurisprudence to determine \"residence\" and if he or she applies one of those methods in each case, his or her decision will be considered valid (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 14).",
    "[22]\nAccording to the jurisprudence, if an applicant establishes that he or she was physically in Canada for 1,095 days during the reference period, the applicant has fulfilled this requirement of the Act (\nSo\n, above, at paragraph 32).",
    "[23]\nIn this case, the judge chose the method suggested in\nPourghasemi (Re)\n, [1993] F.C.J. No. 232 (T.D.) (QL).\nAnalysis",
    "[24]\nThe citizenship judge noted that the applicant was in Canada as a permanent resident beginning on April 12, 2001. He submitted an application for citizenship on August 23, 2004; thus, the applicable reference period of four years preceding his application ran from August 23, 2000, to August 23, 2004.",
    "[25]\nThe applicant states that he resided in Canada for 1,138 days during the reference period (excluding the 90 days during this period when, he admits, he was outside Canada).",
    "[26]\nThe applicant challenges this negative decision on the following grounds.",
    "[27]\nThe judge took it for granted that he had accumulated 1,138 days as a permanent resident during the reference period and therefore met the requirements of the Act. The respondent, for his part, replies that if the decision seems ambiguous about the issue of 1,138 days, it was only an introductory ambivalent comment and the subsequent reasons clearly demonstrated the ratio decidendi of the decision.",
    "[28]\nThe judge's notes (which are legally part of the decision), clearly show that she had not been persuaded that the applicant had really been present in Canada for 1,095 days during the reference period. She gave the following four reasons as the basis for her decision.",
    "[29]\nFirst, the applicant did not provide the court with his passport, which would have showed the dates when he left and entered Canada. The applicant responds that he had to leave his passport with the Moroccan authorities. However, he did not explain why he had been unable to obtain a copy and produce it to the court.",
    "[30]\nSecond, the bank account shows long periods of inactivity (up to six months), which suggests that he could have been outside Canada during those periods. He held this bank account jointly with Jean Lavoie, a real estate broker, who did not have a power of attorney to carry out transactions-an explanation that is difficult to understand.",
    "[31]\nThird, the telephone bills show long periods with no telephone communications, corresponding grosso modo to the periods when the bank account was inactive. The applicant maintains that during those periods, he was busy renovating his house and produced bills and receipts from those activities. However, these documents do not prove that the applicant was in Canada at the time indicated thereon.",
    "[32]\nLast, the judge pointed out that the applicant did not provide any evidence about his work or consultation activities that he carried on during his stay in Canada. In his affidavit, the applicant tried to explain his occupations but did not really succeed in changing this ground.",
    "[33]\nFinally, the respondent demonstrated that the applicant's spouse had purchased plane tickets on December 24, 2003, which does not coincide with the periods of absence from Canada that the applicant identified, i.e. from September 1 to November 18, 2003, and from August 1 to 14, 2004. The evidence also shows that the applicant spent only a few months in Canada from August 24, 2004, to 2008.\nConclusion",
    "[34]\nGiven the evidence in the record, the citizenship judge was correct in believing that the applicant had not presented sufficient evidence to establish his residence in Canada during the reference period and that, consequently, he did not meet the requirements of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the Act. This finding is not unreasonable. It is within the range of inferences that the judge could draw from the facts and the Act, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[35]\nFor these reasons, the Court orders that the applicant's appeal is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[36]\nThe appeal of the decision rendered on May 30, 2008, by Citizenship Judge Gordana Caricevic-Rakovich, refusing the applicant's application for Canadian citizenship because the evidence he produced did not establish that he met the requirements of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, is dismissed.\n[End of document]"

Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n[1]\nLe juge suppléant Frenette\n: Il s'agit ici d'un appel interjeté en vertu du paragraphe 14(5) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n, L.R.C. (1985), ch. C-29, (la Loi) à l'encontre de la décision rendue le 30 mai 2008 par la juge de la Citoyenneté Gordana Caricevic-Rakovich, refusant la demande de citoyenneté canadienne présentée par le demandeur parce que la preuve qu'il a produite ne démontre pas qu'il remplissait les exigences de résidence prévues à l'alinéa 5(1)c) de la Loi.\nLe contexte factuel\n[2]\nLe demandeur est né le 6 mars 1969 au Maroc. Il est entré au Canada le 12 avril 2001 avec son épouse et ses trois enfants. Le 23 août 2004 il déposait sa demande de citoyenneté canadienne.\n[3]\nLa période de référence applicable de quatre ans ou de 1 460 jours précédant sa demande de citoyenneté s'étend du 23 août 2000 au 23 août 2004 (la période de référence).\n[4]\nLe demandeur allègue s'être absenté du Canada pendant 90 jours au total suite à son arrivée au Canada le 12 avril 2001. Ces 90 jours consistent en deux voyages au Maroc, dont un de 77 jours pour visiter sa famille et un autre pour des vacances de 13 jours.\n[5]\nEn novembre 2004, il décidait de retourner en France afin de finaliser des études de doctorat en sciences administratives et économiques. Il amenait alors son épouse et ses enfants avec lui en France mais, à la fin de l'année 2004, celle-ci et les enfants retournent résider au Maroc.\n[6]\nLe demandeur avait acquis une maison d'habitation à Notre-Dame-de-la-Merci, province de Québec, en 1998. Il soutient qu'ils se sont intégrés à la communauté locale entre 2001 et 2004.\n[7]\nLe 5 février 2008, le demandeur se présentait devant la juge de la Citoyenneté suite à une convocation pour une entrevue.\n[8]\nDans son affidavit du 22 août 2008, signé à Rabat, Maroc, le demandeur écrivait, au paragraphe 45:\nLors de l'entrevue, je n'étais pas en mesure de saisir la substance et la portée de certaines questions du juge de la citoyenneté en ce qu'elle recherchait certaines informations bien spécifiques aux questions pour lesquelles j'avais des réponses précises, mais qui m'ont échappé en raison du stress;\n[9]\nLes avis de cotisations fiscales canadiennes pour les années 2001, 2002, 2003 et 2004 révèlent que le demandeur n'a pas bénéficié de revenus taxables au Canada pendant ces années.\nLa décision en litige\n[10]\nLa juge de la Citoyenneté, dans sa décision rendue le 30 mai 2008, rejeta la demande de citoyenneté du demandeur. Elle élabore qu'entre le 12 avril 2001 et le 23 août 2004, le demandeur avait accumulé 1 138 jours de présence physique au Canada; il aurait passé 90 jours hors du Canada pendant la même période. Elle analysa la preuve produite par le demandeur, soit l'acquisition d'une maison d'habitation, ses déclarations fiscales, ses relevés bancaires et ses comptes téléphoniques. Elle considéra que malgré les prétentions du demandeur qu'il était économiste consultant indépendant, il n'avait pas présenté de preuve tangible d'activités professionnelles pendant son séjour au Canada.\n[11]\nLes activités au compte bancaire ouvert au nom du demandeur et d'un dénommé Jean Lavoie, démontrent peu de transactions. Les relevés de ses factures de téléphone indiquent de longues périodes sans communications téléphoniques. L'absence de revenus taxables pendant les quatre années impliquées fut aussi considérée par la juge de la Citoyenneté.\n[12]\nDans sa décision, la juge a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas rempli les conditions de résidence au Canada, tel qu'exigé par l'alinéa 5(1)c) de la Loi.\nLa norme de contrôle applicable\n[13]\nLa norme de contrôle judiciaire applicable aux décisions d'un juge de la Citoyenneté en ce qui concerne la résidence d'un demandeur, est une question de faits ou mixte de droit et de faits, assujettie à la norme d'une décision raisonnable (\nChen c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, 2006 CF 85;\nZhao c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, 2006 CF 1536;\nPourzand c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, 2008 CF 395, au paragraphe 19).\n[14]\nL'évaluation de la juge de la Citoyenneté quant à la connaissance suffisante du Canada, est une pure question de fait à l'égard de laquelle la Cour doit faire preuve de grande retenue (\nArif c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, 2007 CF 557;\nHuang c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, 2005 CF 861;\nWang c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, 2008 CF 391;\nSo c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, 2001 CFPI 733).\n[15]\nL'explication du demandeur quant à ses réponses, est peu convaincante.\nLa législation applicable\n[16]\nL'alinéa 5(1)c) de la Loi se lit comme suit:\n5(1) Le ministre attribue la citoyenneté à toute personne qui, à la fois:\n[. . .]\nc) est un résident permanent au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés et a, dans les quatre ans qui ont précédé la date de sa demande, résidé au Canada pendant au moins trois ans en tout, la durée de sa résidence étant calculée de la manière suivante:\n(i) un demi-jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada avant son admission à titre de résident permanent;\n(ii) un jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada après son admission à titre de résident permanent;\n5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n[. . .]\n(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;\n[17]\nL'article 15 du\nRèglement sur la citoyenneté, 1993\n, DORS/93-246, se lit comme suit:\n15. Une personne possède une connaissance suffisante du Canada et des responsabilités et privilèges attachés à la citoyenneté si elle comprend de façon générale des questions orales simples basées sur les renseignements figurant dans des documents d'auto-apprentissage approuvés par le ministre et présentés aux aspirants à la citoyenneté et si elle peut y répondre correctement. Les questions portent sur:\na) le droit de vote aux élections fédérales, provinciales et municipales et le droit de se porter candidat à une charge élective;\nb) les formalités liées au recensement électoral et au vote;\nc) l'un des sujets suivants, à la discrétion de la personne chargée d'interroger le demandeur:\n(i) les principales caractéristiques de l'histoire sociale et culturelle du Canada,\n(ii) les principales caractéristiques de l'histoire politique du Canada,\n(iii) les principales caractéristiques de la géographie physique et politique du Canada,\n(iv) les responsabilités et privilèges attachés à la citoyenneté autres que ceux visés aux alinéas a) et b).\n15. The criteria for determining whether a person has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship are that the person has a general understanding of and can answer correctly simple oral questions based on the information contained in self-instructional materials approved by the Minister and presented to applicants for the grant of citizenship respecting\n(a) the right to vote in federal, provincial and municipal elections and the right to run for elected office;\n(b) enumerating and voting procedures related to elections; and\n(c) one of the following topics, to be chosen by the person questioning the applicant, namely,\n(i) the chief characteristics of Canadian social and cultural history,\n(ii) the chief characteristics of Canadian political history,\n(iii) the chief characteristics of Canadian physical and political geography, or\n(iv) the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).\n[18]\nLes questions prévues aux paragraphes 15a) et b) sont obligatoires (\nWang\n, ci-dessus, au paragraphe 9).\n[19]\nLe demandeur a le fardeau de la preuve d'établir, selon le poids des probabilités, que les conditions exigées par la Loi ont été remplies (\nMaharatnam c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, [2000] A.C.F. no 405 (1re inst.) (QL);\nMalevsky c. ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration\n, 2002 CFPI 1148).\n[20]\nLa résidence a le sens ordinaire du mot (\nIn re la Loi sur la citoyenneté et in re Papadogiorgakis\n, [1978] 2 C.F. 208;\nKoo (Re)\n, [1993] 1 C.F. 286).\n[21]\nLe juge de la Citoyenneté a l'option de choisir l'une des méthodes préconisées par la jurisprudence pour décider de la  résidence  et s'il applique une de ces méthodes dans le contexte de chaque affaire, sa décision sera considérée valide (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 14).\n[22]\nSelon la jurisprudence, si le demandeur démontre qu'il a été physiquement au Canada 1 095 jours pendant la période de référence, il satisfait à cette exigence de la Loi (\nSo\n, ci-dessus, au paragraphe 32).\n[23]\nDans le dossier en l'espèce, la juge a favorisé la méthode mise de l'avant dans l'arrêt\nPourghasemi (Re)\n, [1993] A.C.F. no 232 (1re inst.) (QL).\nAnalyse\n[24]\nLa juge de la Citoyenneté a constaté que le demandeur était au Canada comme résident permanent à compter du 12 avril 2001. Il a présenté une demande de citoyenneté le 23 août 2004; ainsi sa période de référence applicable de quatre ans précédant sa demande s'étend du 23 août 2000 au 23 août 2004.\n[25]\nSelon le demandeur, il aurait été résident au Canada pendant 1 138 jours pendant la période de référence (excluant les 90 jours qu'il admet avoir séjourné hors du Canada durant cette période).\n[26]\nLe demandeur conteste la décision négative pour les motifs suivants.\n[27]\nLa juge a pris pour acquis qu'il avait accumulé 1 138 jours à titre de résident permanent durant la période de référence, donc il satisfaisait aux exigences de la Loi. Le défendeur, quant à lui, répond que si la décision semble ambiguë quant à la problématique des 1 138 jours, il ne s'agissait que d'une mention introductive de nature ambivalente et que les motifs subséquents ont clairement démontré le ratio decidendi de la décision.\n[28]\nLes notes de la juge (qui font légalement partie de la décision), démontrent clairement qu'elle n'a pas été convaincue que le demandeur avait réellement été présent au Canada pendant 1 095 jours durant la période de référence. Elle élabore les quatre motifs suivants pour justifier sa décision.\n[29]\nPremièrement, le demandeur n'a pas fourni au tribunal son passeport lequel aurait démontré ses entrées et sorties du Canada. Le demandeur répond qu'il avait dû laisser son passeport aux autorités marocaines. Par ailleurs, il n'a pas expliqué pourquoi il n'avait pas pu en obtenir une copie et la produire au tribunal.\n[30]\nDeuxièmement, le compte bancaire démontre de longues périodes d'inactivité (jusqu'à six mois), ce qui tend à démontrer qu'il pouvait alors se trouver en dehors du Canada. Il détenait ce compte de banque conjointement avec Jean Lavoie, un courtier immobilier, mais qui n'avait aucune procuration pour effectuer des transactions - une explication difficile à comprendre.\n[31]\nTroisièmement, les factures téléphoniques révèlent de longues périodes sans communications téléphoniques, correspondant grosso modo aux périodes d'inactivité du compte bancaire. Le demandeur soutient que durant ces périodes il s'affairait à réparer ou à rénover sa maison et produisit des comptes ou reçus émanant de ces activités. Cependant, ces écrits ne prouvent pas que le demandeur était au Canada à l'époque indiquée sur ceux-ci.\n[32]\nEnfin, la juge souligne que le demandeur n'a pas présenté de preuve quant aux activités professionnelles ou de consultation qu'il aurait exercées durant son séjour au Canada. Le demandeur a tenté, dans son affidavit, d'expliquer ses occupations mais sans vraiment réussir à modifier ce motif.\n[33]\nFinalement, le défendeur a démontré que l'épouse du demandeur s'était procuré des billets d'avion le 24 décembre 2003, ce qui ne correspond pas aux périodes d'absence du Canada que le demandeur a identifiées, soit du 1er septembre au 18 novembre 2003 et du 1er au 14 août 2004. La preuve révèle aussi que depuis le 24 août 2004, le demandeur n'a séjourné au Canada que quelques mois jusqu'en 2008.\nConclusion\n[34]\nÀ la lumière des éléments de preuve au dossier, la juge de la Citoyenneté était fondée de croire que le demandeur n'avait pas présenté d'éléments de preuve suffisants établissant sa résidence au Canada durant la période de référence et, par conséquent, il ne répondait pas aux exigences de l'alinéa 5(1)c) de la Loi. Cette conclusion n'est pas déraisonnable. Elle se situe à l'intérieur de la gamme d'inférences que la juge pouvait tirer des faits et de la Loi, tel qu'énoncé par la Cour suprême du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[35]\nPour ces motifs, la Cour ordonne que l'appel du demandeur soit rejeté.\nJUGEMENT\n[36]\nL'appel de la décision rendue le 30 mai 2008 par la juge de la Citoyenneté Gordana Caricevic-Rakovich, refusant la demande de citoyenneté canadienne présentée par le demandeur parce que la preuve qu'il a produite ne démontre pas qu'il remplissait les exigences de l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n, L.R.C. (1985), ch. C-29, est rejeté.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pursuant to subsection 14(5) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, (the Act) against the decision rendered on May 30, 2008, by Citizenship Judge Gordana Caricevic-Rakovich, refusing the application for Canadian citizenship submitted by the applicant because the evidence he presented did not demonstrate that he met the residency requirements under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act.\nFacts\n[2]\nThe applicant was born on March 6, 1969, in Morocco. He arrived in Canada on April 12, 2001, with his wife and his three children. On August 23, 2004, he filed his application for Canadian citizenship.\n[3]\nThe applicable reference period of four years or 1,460 days preceding his application for citizenship ran from August 23, 2000, to August 23, 2004 (the reference period).\n[4]\nThe applicant says that he was absent from Canada for a total of 90 days following his arrival in Canada on April 12, 2001. The 90 days consisted of two trips to Morocco: a 77-day trip to visit his family and a 13-day trip for vacation.\n[5]\nIn November 2004, he decided to return to France to complete his doctorate in business administration and economics. He brought his wife and children with him to France but, at the end of 2004, she and the children returned to Morocco to live.\n[6]\nThe applicant had acquired a house in Notre-Dame-de-la-Merci, in the province of Quebec, in 1998. He contends that they were established in the local community between 2001 and 2004.\n[7]\nOn February 5, 2008, the applicant appeared before the citizenship judge after being invited to an interview.\n[8]\nAt paragraph 45 of his affidavit dated August 22, 2008, signed at Rabat, Morocco, the applicant wrote:\n[translation] At the interview, I did not understand the substance and the scope of some of the questions the citizenship judge asked; she was looking for certain information that was very specific to the questions and I had specific answers, but they slipped my mind because of stress.\n[9]\nThe Canadian notices of assessment for 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 show that the applicant had no taxable income in Canada during those years.\nImpugned decision\n[10]\nIn her decision dated May 30, 2008, the citizenship judge rejected the applicant's application for citizenship. She explained that between April 12, 2001, and August 23, 2004, the applicant had accumulated 1,138 days of physical presence in Canada; he had spent 90 days outside Canada during the same period. She analyzed the evidence presented by the applicant, i.e., the acquisition of a house, his tax returns, bank statements and telephone bills. She considered the fact that, despite the applicant's submissions that he was an economist/independent consultant, he had not provided any tangible evidence of his work activities during his stay in Canada.\n[11]\nThe bank account that was opened in the name of the applicant and one Jean Lavoie shows few transactions. The telephone bill statements indicate long periods without any telephone communications. The citizenship judge also considered the lack of taxable income during the four years involved.\n[12]\nIn her decision, the judge concluded that the applicant had not met the residence conditions in Canada, as required under paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the Act.\nStandard of review\n[13]\nThe applicable standard of review for decisions of a citizenship judge concerning an applicant's residence, which is a question of fact or mixed law and fact, is reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[14]\nA citizenship judge's assessment on the issue of adequate knowledge of Canada is a purely factual question for which the Court should show considerable deference (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[15]\nThe applicant's explanation regarding his answers is not convincing.\nApplicable legislation\n[16]\nParagraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the Act reads as follows:\n5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n. . . . .\n(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;\n5(1) Le ministre attribue la citoyenneté à toute personne qui, à la fois:\n[. . .]\nc) est un résident permanent au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés et a, dans les quatre ans qui ont précédé la date de sa demande, résidé au Canada pendant au moins trois ans en tout, la durée de sa résidence étant calculée de la manière suivante:\n(i) un demi-jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada avant son admission à titre de résident permanent;\n(ii) un jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada après son admission à titre de résident permanent;\n[17]\nSection 15 of the\nCitizenship Regulations, 1993\n, SOR/93-246, reads as follows:\n15. The criteria for determining whether a person has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship are that the person has a general understanding of and can answer correctly simple oral questions based on the information contained in self-instructional materials approved by the Minister and presented to applicants for the grant of citizenship respecting\n(a) the right to vote in federal, provincial and municipal elections and the right to run for elected office;\n(b) enumerating and voting procedures related to elections; and\n(c) one of the following topics, to be chosen by the person questioning the applicant, namely,\n(i) the chief characteristics of Canadian social and cultural history,\n(ii) the chief characteristics of Canadian political history,\n(iii) the chief characteristics of Canadian physical and political geography, or\n(iv) the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).\n15. Une personne possède une connaissance suffisante du Canada et des responsabilités et privilèges attachés à la citoyenneté si elle comprend de façon générale des questions orales simples basées sur les renseignements figurant dans des documents d'auto-apprentissage approuvés par le ministre et présentés aux aspirants à la citoyenneté et si elle peut y répondre correctement. Les questions portent sur:\na) le droit de vote aux élections fédérales, provinciales et municipales et le droit de se porter candidat à une charge élective;\nb) les formalités liées au recensement électoral et au vote;\nc) l'un des sujets suivants, à la discrétion de la personne chargée d'interroger the applicant:\n(i) les principales caractéristiques de l'histoire sociale et culturelle du Canada,\n(ii) les principales caractéristiques de l'histoire politique du Canada,\n(iii) les principales caractéristiques de la géographie physique et politique du Canada,\n(iv) les responsabilités et privilèges attachés à la citoyenneté autres que ceux visés aux alinéas a) et b).\n[18]\nThe questions in paragraphs 15(a) and (b) are mandatory (\nWang\n, above, at paragraph 9).\n[19]\nThe onus is on the applicant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the conditions required by the Act have been satisfied (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nKoo (Re)\n, [1993] 1 F.C. 286).\n[21]\nIt is open to the citizenship judge to choose one of the methods suggested in the jurisprudence to determine \"residence\" and if he or she applies one of those methods in each case, his or her decision will be considered valid (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 14).\n[22]\nAccording to the jurisprudence, if an applicant establishes that he or she was physically in Canada for 1,095 days during the reference period, the applicant has fulfilled this requirement of the Act (\nSo\n, above, at paragraph 32).\n[23]\nIn this case, the judge chose the method suggested in\nPourghasemi (Re)\n, [1993] F.C.J. No. 232 (T.D.) (QL).\nAnalysis\n[24]\nThe citizenship judge noted that the applicant was in Canada as a permanent resident beginning on April 12, 2001. He submitted an application for citizenship on August 23, 2004; thus, the applicable reference period of four years preceding his application ran from August 23, 2000, to August 23, 2004.\n[25]\nThe applicant states that he resided in Canada for 1,138 days during the reference period (excluding the 90 days during this period when, he admits, he was outside Canada).\n[26]\nThe applicant challenges this negative decision on the following grounds.\n[27]\nThe judge took it for granted that he had accumulated 1,138 days as a permanent resident during the reference period and therefore met the requirements of the Act. The respondent, for his part, replies that if the decision seems ambiguous about the issue of 1,138 days, it was only an introductory ambivalent comment and the subsequent reasons clearly demonstrated the ratio decidendi of the decision.\n[28]\nThe judge's notes (which are legally part of the decision), clearly show that she had not been persuaded that the applicant had really been present in Canada for 1,095 days during the reference period. She gave the following four reasons as the basis for her decision.\n[29]\nFirst, the applicant did not provide the court with his passport, which would have showed the dates when he left and entered Canada. The applicant responds that he had to leave his passport with the Moroccan authorities. However, he did not explain why he had been unable to obtain a copy and produce it to the court.\n[30]\nSecond, the bank account shows long periods of inactivity (up to six months), which suggests that he could have been outside Canada during those periods. He held this bank account jointly with Jean Lavoie, a real estate broker, who did not have a power of attorney to carry out transactions-an explanation that is difficult to understand.\n[31]\nThird, the telephone bills show long periods with no telephone communications, corresponding grosso modo to the periods when the bank account was inactive. The applicant maintains that during those periods, he was busy renovating his house and produced bills and receipts from those activities. However, these documents do not prove that the applicant was in Canada at the time indicated thereon.\n[32]\nLast, the judge pointed out that the applicant did not provide any evidence about his work or consultation activities that he carried on during his stay in Canada. In his affidavit, the applicant tried to explain his occupations but did not really succeed in changing this ground.\n[33]\nFinally, the respondent demonstrated that the applicant's spouse had purchased plane tickets on December 24, 2003, which does not coincide with the periods of absence from Canada that the applicant identified, i.e. from September 1 to November 18, 2003, and from August 1 to 14, 2004. The evidence also shows that the applicant spent only a few months in Canada from August 24, 2004, to 2008.\nConclusion\n[34]\nGiven the evidence in the record, the citizenship judge was correct in believing that the applicant had not presented sufficient evidence to establish his residence in Canada during the reference period and that, consequently, he did not meet the requirements of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the Act. This finding is not unreasonable. It is within the range of inferences that the judge could draw from the facts and the Act, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[35]\nFor these reasons, the Court orders that the applicant's appeal is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n[36]\nThe appeal of the decision rendered on May 30, 2008, by Citizenship Judge Gordana Caricevic-Rakovich, refusing the applicant's application for Canadian citizenship because the evidence he produced did not establish that he met the requirements of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, is dismissed.\n[End of document]",

C-29, (the Act) against the decision rendered on May 30, 2008 by Citizenship Judge Gordana Caricevic-Rakovich, refusing the application for Canadian citizenship presented by the applicant because the proof he produced did not demonstrate that he met the residency requirements provided for in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act.\nThe factual context\n\n[2]\nThe applicant was born on March 6, 1969, in Morocco. He arrived in Canada on April 12, 2001, with his wife and his three children. On August 23, 2004, he filed his application for Canadian citizenship.\n\n[3]\nThe applicable reference period of four years or 1,460 days preceding his application for citizenship ran from August 23, 2000, to August 23, 2004 (the reference period).\n\n[4]\nThe applicant says that he was absent from Canada for a total of 90 days following his arrival in Canada on April 12, 2001.
