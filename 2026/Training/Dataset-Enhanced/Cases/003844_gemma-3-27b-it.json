    "[1]\nReed, J.\n: The applicants seek an order quashing a decision of a visa officer which found that Elena Chatrova (the applicant) did not meet the requirements for immigration to Canada. He awarded her 68 units of assessment pursuant to the factors listed in Schedule I of the\nImmigration Regulations\n. A minimum of 70 units is required.",
    "[2]\nI am persuaded that the decision under review should be set aside. In the first place, it is clear to me that the visa officer did not properly evaluate the applicant's language skills. I will refer first to the arguments concerning the assessment of her verbal skills. In his decision letter, refusing the applicant an immigrant visa, the visa officer explained to her that her English was good but not \"flawless\". The applicant is not required to have flawless English in order to be awarded three points. The visa officer has to assess whether her English is \"fluent\". I do not place much emphasis on the wording of the visa officer's letter since the visa officer's notes indicate that it was fluency, not flawlessness, that he assessed. At the same time, the use of the word \"flawless\", in the decision letter, understandably left the applicant somewhat puzzled. It must have raised in her mind a question as to whether she was being fairly assessed. She responded to that letter by stating that she had never claimed her English to be flawless but she did claim to be fluent.",
    "[3]\nI turn to the assessment of her ability to write in English. It is this assessment that I find most troublesome. The visa officer assumed that the applicant's ability in this area was comparable to her ability to speak the language. She had claimed fluency in all three areas which are assessed: reading, writing and speaking. The visa officer accepted her self assessment insofar as reading is concerned and awarded her three points. He awarded her two points for her verbal skills because he determined, on speaking to her, that her English was good but not fluent. He assumed, however, that her writing ability was comparable to her speaking ability, not to her reading ability. No test was done nor was she asked to demonstrate her writing ability. In the circumstances of this case, this is a significant error.",
    "[4]\nThe applicant has a university degree for which her major area of study was English language and literature. Following her graduation she held several jobs including that of English teacher and librarian. She now works with the Latvian - Russian Joint Venture Solis - Riga. In that job she works mainly in the Russian and Latvian languages but she also translates documents, when required, into English. It is certainly within the common knowledge of many people who acquire a second language that when one is not surrounded by the spoken language, fluency in reading and writing is more easily attained than fluency in speaking. Even if I may not take notice of this consideration, given the applicant's educational and employment history, I do not think the visa officer can reject her self assessment with respect to her writing ability on the basis of the assumption that it is at the same level as her speaking ability. Counsel for the respondent argues that it is for the applicant to prove her skills. That is so but, in the circumstances of this case, I think she is entitled to be alerted to the fact that her self assessment is being questioned before a burden falls on her to provide further evidence in this regard.",
    "[5]\nSecondly, the visa officer not only assessed her language abilities in the context of the units awarded under factor 8 in Schedule I (Knowledge of English and French Languages), he also used what he considered to be her deficiencies in that area as a reason for not awarding her more points under factor 9 (Personal Suitability). The visa officer is required by the regulations to consider, under factor 9, the person's \"adaptability, motivation, initiative, resourcefulness and other similar qualities\". This assessment is for the purpose of assessing the individual's personal suitability to become successfully established in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 167 (F.C.A.), a decision of a visa officer was set aside because he had taken into account, when assessing personal suitability, matters that had already been considered under the other assessment factors listed in Column 1 of Schedule I. The intended occupation of the applicant in that case was that of machinist. The visa officer took into account, when assessing personal suitability, the fact that the applicant had no relatives in Canada, had no close ties in Canada, had never visited Canada and had difficulty in communicating. The court held that this was inappropriate because, at least, some of these had already been considered under the other assessment factors listed in Column 1 of Schedule I. Thus, they were being taken into account a second time and, what is more, the court noted that the matters, in question, were not qualities similar to adaptability, motivation, initiative and resourcefulness.",
    "[6]\nIn the present case, the visa officer gave the applicant 4 out of a possible 10 points for personal suitability because:\n\"she had not taken basic steps to prepare herself for immigration to Canada, such as learning about realistic employment requirements or opportunities for an 'executive secretary', learning about Canadian society in general, applying for employment,\nimproving her language skills to the level an 'executive secretary' would need to know\n, learning the appropriate and very basic software that an 'executive secretary' would need to know and\nlearning the English-language versions of the software that she needed to know\n. She thus failed to show sufficient adaptability, motivation, initiative, resourcefulness and other similar qualities.\" (underlining added)",
    "[7]\nIt is clear that her language skills were being, as counsel for the applicant put it, \"double-counted\". Counsel for the respondent defends this approach by reference to the decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), revd. [1994] 1 F.C. 639; 164 N.R. 257 (F.C.A.), revd. [1995] 1 S.C.R. 725; 179 N.R. 70. As I read that decision, it stands for the proposition that all the factors listed in Column 1 to Schedule I are addressed to assessing an applicant's ability to establish himself or herself in Canada, on an economically independent basis. This overriding purpose is relevant to the assessment of each factor in Schedule I but it does not obviate the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision and the finding that double counting is not appropriate. I note that subs. 10(3) of the\nRegulations\nalways allows the visa officer, at the end of an assessment, to decide that despite an award of 70 points, that assessment does not reflect the chances of the particular applicant becoming successfully established in Canada. A visa can then be denied, providing the approval and procedure required by that subsection are followed.",
    "[8]\nIn addition to the treatment of the applicant's language skills, there is another aspect of the assessment that is troubling. Great emphasis was placed on her lack of knowledge of computer software. As appears from the portion of the visa officer's affidavit quoted above, her lack of knowledge in this area was considered to demonstrate a lack of motivation, initiative, resourcefulness and other similar qualities under factor 9. It was also considered in determining the number of points the applicant was granted under factor 3 (Experience). The visa officer wrote in his affidavit:\n\"\nShe had virtually no formal software training\n. She was familiar with the Russian-language version of Lotus Organizer. For about half a year she had sometimes been using the Russian-language version of Word for Windows, although most typing using this software was done by her subordinates (3 subordinates).\nShe did not do spreadsheets and had never heard of Word Perfect\n.\" (underlining added)",
    "[9]\nWith respect to his reasons for awarding her only 4 out of 8 possible points for experience he wrote:\n\"... Furthermore, I determined that the Applicant did not have experience in the full range of responsibilities required of an 'executive secretary' in Canada. In particular,\nshe was unfamiliar with English language versions of software packages; the only software package that she regularly used was Lotus Organizer and sometimes Word for Windows\n; she was\ncompletely unfamiliar with basic software packages such as Word Perfect; and indicated no knowledge of any spreadsheet programmes or data base programmes\n. Nevertheless, given her work experience with 'Consum' and her two years' work experience with SOLIS-RIGA, I decided that the Applicant had accumulated roughly the equivalent of two years of experience as an Executive Secretary. ...\" (underlining added)",
    "[10]\nThe occupational category under which the applicant was being asked to be assessed, as a potential immigrant to Canada, is \"executive secretary\". The description of that occupation found in the\nCanadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations 1971\n(\"\nCCDO\n\") reads as follows:\n\"\n4111-111 EXECUTIVE SECRETARY\n(clerical)\n\"Performs secretarial and administrative duties for office executive: Performs duties similar to those of\n4111-110 SECRETARY\n(clerical) utilizing secretarial experience and knowledge of office administration and public relations. Arranges conferences and other meetings and researches and compiles information for employer. Acts on routine matters affecting day to day operations of organization, in employer's absence. May perform other duties including supervising office workers.\n\"4111-110 SECRETARY\n(clerical)\nsecretarial stenographer.\n\"Schedules appointments, gives information to callers, takes dictation and relieves employer of clerical work and minor administrative and business details, performing any of the following duties:\nReads and routes incoming mail. Locates and attaches appropriate file to correspondence to be answered by employer. Takes dictation in shorthand or on stenotype machine, and transcribes on typewriter from notes or voice recordings. Composes and types correspondence. Files correspondence and other records. Answers telephone and gives information to caller, or routes call to appropriate official, and places outgoing calls. Schedules appointments for employer and reminds him when they are due. Greets visitors, ascertains nature of business and conducts visitors to employer or to appropriate person. Compiles and types statistical reports. Records minutes of meetings.\nMay keep confidential personnel records. May arrange travel schedules and reservations. May be designated according to type of work performed; for example, ...\"",
    "[11]\nThere is no doubt that that description is out of date. Two questions arose: whether the visa officer could go outside the\nCCDO\ndefinition set out above, in assessing the applicant's experience and whether, in any event, the visa officer can take an absence of such skills, which are not referred to in the\nCCDO\n, as demonstrating an absence of motivation, initiative, adaptability and resourcefulness.",
    "[12]\nIt is necessary to describe the relevance of the\nCCDO\nfor immigrant assessment purposes. Visa officers are instructed to assess potential immigrants in accordance with certain factors described in Schedule I to the\nImmigration Regulations\n. Some of the nine factors, under which an applicant is to be assessed, are inter-related. This is particularly true for factor 4 (Occupational Demand), factor 3 (Experience) and factor 2 (Specific Vocational Preparation). The number of points a potential immigrant is given under factor 4 depends upon the occupation \"that the applicant is qualified for and is prepared to follow in Canada\". There is no description of what constitutes an occupation or how these are to be defined. Factor 3 (Experience) and factor 4 (Specific Vocational Preparation) are connected to factor 2. The number of points to be awarded with respect to experience relates to \"experience in the occupation in which the applicant is assessed under item 4 ...\". The number of points to be awarded for specific vocational preparation (SVP) are measured by the amount of training specified in the\nCCDO\nas necessary for average performance in the occupation in which the applicant is assessed under item 4. In addition, factor 2 (Specific Vocational Preparation) and factor 3 (Experience) are inter-related. The number of points awarded for experience is directly related to the SVP factor. As I understand this assessment, it is that a potential immigrant who lacks formal education (SVP) in the relevant occupation still obtains points by having had experience in that occupation. The two factors are relevant in all assessments so that a person with a greater degree of formal education but less experience will be assessed fairly against a person with less formal education but more experience.",
    "[13]\nThe fact that is most pertinent for present purposes is that the degree of formal education (SVP) required for each occupation is specifically linked to the occupation listing and description in the\nCCDO\n. The question arises, then, that if the SVP assessment is listed as part of the occupation description found in the\nCCDO\nand the experience factor is linked to the SVP, should the visa officer's assessment of an applicant's experience not be constrained by reference to the\nCCDO\noccupation description. This has been raised, recently, in a number of decisions of this court.",
    "[14]\nWhile I have set out the argument with respect to constraints on the visa officer's assessment, I do not think it is necessary for me to make any further comments on it for the purposes of this case. I think it is sufficient to say that, in any event, there has been a \"double counting\" of her alleged lack of computer skills. It was counted under both the Experience factor and the Personal Suitability factor. Also, an applicant should not be faulted as lacking in adaptability, motivation, initiative and resourcefulness for not having acquired skills in English language computer software when that skill is not part of the\nCCDO\noccupation description. The individual lives and works abroad. In such circumstance considerable reliance will be placed on government documentary materials published in relation to the immigrant assessment process. It may be that her failure to directly explore the Canadian job market, before applying to be accepted as an immigrant, is something that can be taken into account under factor 9, however, to fault her as lacking in adaptability, motivation, initiative and resourcefulness because she lacks knowledge of English language computer software, when the government published occupation description makes no reference to these skills is not reasonable.",
    "[15]\nOne last consideration, there is some question about the assessment of the extent of her computer skills that was made. It was acknowledged that she had some computer skills. She used Lotus Organizer and Word for Windows. She was assessed as fluent in reading English, a skill which using English language computer programs depends upon. Great emphasis was put by the visa officer on the fact that she did not know Word Perfect. One has to ask why this was so important. If she knew Word for Windows, arguably a more complex program, and had basic computer skills, why could she not have acquired the ability to use Word Perfect in, perhaps, half a day. In the reasons there does seem to be an over emphasis on the absence of any experience with Word Perfect.",
    "[16]\nIn any event, it suffices to say that the lack of any real assessment of her writing skills and the double counting both her language skills and her alleged lack of computer skills alone, require me to set the decision aside and refer the application back for reconsideration by another visa officer.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Giovanni A.

The visa officer took into account, when assessing personal suitability, the fact that the applicant had no relatives in Canada, had no close ties in Canada, had never visited Canada and had difficulty in communicating. The court held that this was inappropriate because, at least, some of these had already been considered under the other assessment factors listed in Column 1 of Schedule I. Thus, they were being taken into account a second time and, what is more, the court noted that the matters, in question, were not qualities similar to adaptability, motivation, initiative and resourcefulness.\n\n[6]\nIn the present case, the visa officer gave the applicant 4 out of a possible 10 points for personal suitability because:\n\"she had not taken basic steps to prepare herself for immigration to Canada, such as learning about realistic employment requirements or opportunities for an 'executive secretary', learning about Canadian society in general, applying for employment,\nimproving her language skills to the level an 'executive secretary' would need to know\n, learning the appropriate and very basic software that an 'executive secretary' would need to know and\nlearning the English-language versions of the software that she needed to know\n. She thus failed to show sufficient adaptability, motivation, initiative, resourcefulness and other similar qualities.\" (underlining added)\n\n[7]\nIt is clear that her language skills were being, as counsel for the applicant put it, \"double-counted\". Counsel for the respondent defends this approach by reference to the decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), revd. [1994] 1 F.C. 639; 164 N.R. 257 (F.C.A.), revd. [1995] 1 S.C.R. 725; 179 N.R. 70. As I read that decision, it stands for the proposition that all the factors listed in Column 1 to Schedule I are addressed to assessing an applicant's ability to establish himself or herself in Canada, on an economically independent basis. This overriding purpose is relevant to the assessment of each factor in Schedule I but it does not obviate the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision and the finding that double counting is not appropriate. I note that subs. 10(3) of the\nRegulations\nalways allows the visa officer, at the end of an assessment, to decide that despite an award of 70 points, that assessment does not reflect the chances of the particular applicant becoming successfully established in Canada. A visa can then be denied, providing the approval and procedure required by that subsection are followed.\n\n[8]\nIn addition to the treatment of the applicant's language skills, there is another aspect of the assessment that is troubling. Great emphasis was placed on her lack of knowledge of computer software. As appears from the portion of the visa officer's affidavit quoted above, her lack of knowledge in this area was considered to demonstrate a lack of motivation, initiative, resourcefulness and other similar qualities under factor 9. It was also considered in determining the number of points the applicant was granted under factor 3 (Experience). The visa officer wrote in his affidavit:\n\"\nShe had virtually no formal software training\n. She was familiar with the Russian-language version of Lotus Organizer. For about half a year she had sometimes been using the Russian-language version of Word for Windows, although most typing using this software was done by her subordinates (3 subordinates).\nShe did not do spreadsheets and had never heard of Word Perfect\n.\" (underlining added)\n\n[9]\nWith respect to his reasons for awarding her only 4 out of 8 possible points for experience he wrote:\n\"... Furthermore, I determined that the Applicant did not have experience in the full range of responsibilities required of an 'executive secretary' in Canada. In particular,\nshe was unfamiliar with English language versions of software packages; the only software package that she regularly used was Lotus Organizer and sometimes Word for Windows\n; she was\ncompletely unfamiliar with basic software packages such as Word Perfect; and indicated no knowledge of any spreadsheet programmes or data base programmes\n. Nevertheless, given her work experience with 'Consum' and her two years' work experience with SOLIS-RIGA, I decided that the Applicant had accumulated roughly the equivalent of two years of experience as an Executive Secretary. ...\" (underlining added)\n\n[10]\nThe occupational category under which the applicant was being asked to be assessed, as a potential immigrant to Canada, is \"executive secretary\". The description of that occupation found in the\nCanadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations 1971\n(\"\nCCDO\n\") reads as follows:\n\"\n4111-111 EXECUTIVE SECRETARY\n(clerical)\n\"Performs secretarial and administrative duties for office executive: Performs duties similar to those of\n4111-110 SECRETARY\n(clerical) utilizing secretarial experience and knowledge of office administration and public relations. Arranges conferences and other meetings and researches and compiles information for employer. Acts on routine matters affecting day to day operations of organization, in employer's absence. May perform other duties including supervising office workers.\n\"4111-110 SECRETARY\n(clerical)\nsecretarial stenographer.\n\"Schedules appointments, gives information to callers, takes dictation and relieves employer of clerical work and minor administrative and business details, performing any of the following duties:\nReads and routes incoming mail. Locates and attaches appropriate file to correspondence to be answered by employer. Takes dictation in shorthand or on stenotype machine, and transcribes on typewriter from notes or voice recordings. Composes and types correspondence. Files correspondence and other records. Answers telephone and gives information to caller, or routes call to appropriate official, and places outgoing calls. Schedules appointments for employer and reminds him when they are due. Greets visitors, ascertains nature of business and conducts visitors to employer or to appropriate person. Compiles and types statistical reports. Records minutes of meetings.\nMay keep confidential personnel records. May arrange travel schedules and reservations. May be designated according to type of work performed; for example, ...\"\n\n[11]\nThere is no doubt that that description is out of date. Two questions arose: whether the visa officer could go outside the\nCCDO\ndefinition set out above, in assessing the applicant's experience and whether, in any event, the visa officer can take an absence of such skills, which are not referred to in the\nCCDO\n, as demonstrating an absence of motivation, initiative, adaptability and resourcefulness.\n\n[12]\nIt is necessary to describe the relevance of the\nCCDO\nfor immigrant assessment purposes. Visa officers are instructed to assess potential immigrants in accordance with certain factors described in Schedule I to the\nImmigration Regulations\n. Some of the nine factors, under which an applicant is to be assessed, are inter-related. This is particularly true for factor 4 (Occupational Demand), factor 3 (Experience) and factor 2 (Specific Vocational Preparation). The number of points a potential immigrant is given under factor 4 depends upon the occupation \"that the applicant is qualified for and is prepared to follow in Canada\". There is no description of what constitutes an occupation or how these are to be defined. Factor 3 (Experience) and factor 4 (Specific Vocational Preparation) are connected to factor 2. The number of points to be awarded with respect to experience relates to \"experience in the occupation in which the applicant is assessed under item 4 ...\". The number of points to be awarded for specific vocational preparation (SVP) are measured by the amount of training specified in the\nCCDO\nas necessary for average performance in the occupation in which the applicant is assessed under item 4. In addition, factor 2 (Specific Vocational Preparation) and factor 3 (Experience) are inter-related. The number of points awarded for experience is directly related to the SVP factor. As I understand this assessment, it is that a potential immigrant who lacks formal education (SVP) in the relevant occupation still obtains points by having had experience in that occupation. The two factors are relevant in all assessments so that a person with a greater degree of formal education but less experience will be assessed fairly against a person with less formal education but more experience.\n\n[13]\nThe fact that is most pertinent for present purposes is that the degree of formal education (SVP) required for each occupation is specifically linked to the occupation listing and description in the\nCCDO\n. The question arises, then, that if the SVP assessment is listed as part of the occupation description found in the\nCCDO\nand the experience factor is linked to the SVP, should the visa officer's assessment of an applicant's experience not be constrained by reference to the\nCCDO\noccupation description. This has been raised, recently, in a number of decisions of this court.\n\n[14]\nWhile I have set out the argument with respect to constraints on the visa officer's assessment, I do not think it is necessary for me to make any further comments on it for the purposes of this case. I think it is sufficient to say that, in any event, there has been a \"double counting\" of her alleged lack of computer skills. It was counted under both the Experience factor and the Personal Suitability factor. Also, an applicant should not be faulted as lacking in adaptability, motivation, initiative and resourcefulness for not having acquired skills in English language computer software when that skill is not part of the\nCCDO\noccupation description. The individual lives and works abroad. In such circumstance considerable reliance will be placed on government documentary materials published in relation to the immigrant assessment process. It may be that her failure to directly explore the Canadian job market, before applying to be accepted as an immigrant, is something that can be taken into account under factor 9, however, to fault her as lacking in adaptability, motivation, initiative and resourcefulness because she lacks knowledge of English language computer software, when the government published occupation description makes no reference to these skills is not reasonable.\n\n[15]\nOne last consideration, there is some question about the assessment of the extent of her computer skills that was made. It was acknowledged that she had some computer skills. She used Lotus Organizer and Word for Windows. She was assessed as fluent in reading English, a skill which using English language computer programs depends upon. Great emphasis was put by the visa officer on the fact that she did not know Word Perfect. One has to ask why this was so important. If she knew Word for Windows, arguably a more complex program, and had basic computer skills, why could she not have acquired the ability to use Word Perfect in, perhaps, half a day. In the reasons there does seem to be an over emphasis on the absence of any experience with Word Perfect.\n\n[16]\nIn any event, it suffices to say that the lack of any real assessment of her writing skills and the double counting both her language skills and her alleged lack of computer skills alone, require me to set the decision aside and refer the application back for reconsideration by another visa officer.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Giovanni A.

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court found the visa officer’s assessment of the applicant’s language skills flawed, specifically regarding writing ability. The officer assumed writing ability mirrored speaking ability without any direct assessment, which the court deemed an error given the applicant’s educational background (a degree in English language and literature) and professional experience (English teacher, translator). The court reasoned that fluency in reading and writing is often more easily attained than speaking when not immersed in the language, and the officer lacked sufficient basis to reject the applicant’s self-assessment of writing fluency.",
      "The court determined the visa officer improperly ‘double-counted’ deficiencies in the applicant’s English language skills. The officer used perceived language deficiencies both to reduce points under the ‘Knowledge of English and French Languages’ factor *and* to lower the score for ‘Personal Suitability,’ which the court found inappropriate, citing precedent (Imm. L.R.(2d) 167 (F.C.A.)) where similar double-counting was disallowed. The court emphasized that personal suitability should assess qualities like adaptability, motivation, and initiative, not re-evaluate already assessed skills.",
      "The court criticized the visa officer for considering the applicant’s lack of computer skills as evidence of a lack of adaptability, motivation, and initiative, and also factoring it into the ‘Experience’ assessment. The court highlighted that the relevant job description (Executive Secretary) in the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (CCDO) did not require proficiency in specific software like Word Perfect. The court reasoned that penalizing the applicant for lacking skills not outlined in the official job description was unreasonable, especially given she was applying from abroad and should reasonably rely on official government documentation.",
      "The court acknowledged the interconnectedness of the assessment factors (Occupational Demand, Experience, and Specific Vocational Preparation) and the importance of the CCDO in defining occupations and required skills. While not making a definitive ruling on the extent to which the visa officer was constrained by the CCDO, the court found the double-counting of computer skills, combined with the lack of assessment of writing skills, sufficient grounds to overturn the decision.",
      "The court found the emphasis on the applicant’s lack of Word Perfect knowledge disproportionate, noting her familiarity with more complex software (Word for Windows) and basic computer literacy should have been sufficient. The court implied that the ability to learn new software quickly should have been considered."
