    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nLafrenière, Prothonotary\nNovember 23, 2004.\nCounsel:\nDavid Coles, for the applicants;\nMartin Ward and Elizabeth Richards, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nBoyne Clarke, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, for the applicants;\nMorris Rosenberg, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.",
    "[1]\nLafrenière, Prothonotary\n: The applicant, Robert Gordon, is a journalist employed by the co-applicant, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (the \"CBC\"). The two applicants seek an order that the notice periods and other time requirements under the Federal Court Rules, 1998 (\"the Rules\") that are applicable to their application for judicial review be abridged, and that a date be fixed as soon as possible for a hearing of the application for judicial review. Alternatively, they seek directions from the Court for the proper procedure to expedite the proceeding.",
    "[2]\nThe issue on this motion is whether the Court ought to depart from the timelines prescribed in Part 5 of the Rules, and more particularly, Rules 307, 308, 309, 310 and 314.\nBackground",
    "[3]\nThe main proceeding is an application for judicial review in respect of a decision dated November 4, 2004 of a Board of Inquiry convened by the Canadian Forces pursuant to s. 45 of the National Defence Act to investigate and report on the death and casualties suffered onboard the HMCS Chicoutimi on October 5, 2004 (the \"Board\").",
    "[4]\nThe Board has been tasked to complete its proceedings and report by November 30, 2004. It collected evidence and heard witnesses for 3 weeks in Scotland before commencing proceedings in Halifax in early November.",
    "[5]\nThe Canadian media, including the applicants, first requested access to the Board's proceedings in Halifax on November 2, 2004. After their informal request was denied, the applicants made an application, pursuant to Section 12 of the Board of Inquiries Terms of Reference, for immediate access to the hearings, or alternatively, for an opportunity to make representations before the Board in support of their request for access.",
    "[6]\nThe President of the Board denied the applicants' request for immediate access and also declined to hear oral submissions. He agreed, however, to accept written representations in support of the applicants' request.",
    "[7]\nOn November 5, 2004, following receipt of written submissions, the Board denied the applicants access to the Board hearing on the basis that the Board is an internal investigation body, and not a public inquiry or quasi-judicial body. The Board indicated that its mandate must be exercised in a very short time, and that allowing public access would delay the proceeding.",
    "[8]\nThe applicants responded with an application for judicial review and an emergency motion for a stay of the Board's proceedings on the grounds that there was a denial of their Charter rights. Harrington, J. accommodated the applicants by holding an emergency hearing on the night of Friday, November 5, 2004 and into the early morning of Saturday, November 6, 2004.",
    "[9]\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, Harrington, J. dismissed the motion orally, having concluded that the applicants failed to establish that there was a serious issue, that they would sustain irreparable harm, or that the balance of convenience was in their favour. He added that his decision should not be interpreted as dispositive of the merits of the application for judicial review, and that the applicants were entitled to bring a motion for an expedited hearing, if so advised. The applicants accepted this invitation by bringing the present motion.",
    "[10]\nWhen questioned at the hearing of the motion as to what the applicants were seeking in terms of expedited schedule, their counsel replied that they wanted the hearing of the application held within the next few days. Counsel maintained that the respondent could simply limit himself to the affidavit evidence he has already filed in response to the stay motion, that cross-examination on affidavits could be dispensed with, and that the respondent should be required to serve and file his record immediately.\nAnalysis",
    "[11]\nRule 8(1) of the Rules gives the Court the general power to extend or abridge any period set out in the Rules in appropriate circumstances. In order to obtain an abridgment of time, an applicant must establish not only that the matter is urgent, but also that the respondent will not be prejudiced by the compromise of the established procedure:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) at para.15;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 43.",
    "[12]\nThe applicants state in their notice of application that their right to free expression, protected by section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\"the Charter\"), has been infringed by the Board decision. According to the applicants, if an infringement of their right to free expression has occurred, the only remedy that alleviates the infringement is that the applicants be allowed access to the Board hearings. Expediency is therefore necessary, from the applicants' perspective, to ensure that an appropriate remedy is available. The applicants maintain that the balance of convenience favours abridging the time in order to protect them, and the public, from an infringement of their right to free expression.",
    "[13]\nFor the reasons that follow, I decline to grant the relief requested.",
    "[14]\nFirst, the matter cannot be viewed as urgent in circumstances where the proceedings have been ongoing since October 8, 2004, and there has been no request by the applicants for access until the first week of November. The applicants have already missed the opportunity to seek access to a significant portion of the inquiry, and it is anticipated that the Board hearing will be concluded shortly.",
    "[15]\nThe applicants have created an artificial sense of urgency through their own delay. The testimony of witnesses before the Board commenced in Scotland on October 11, 2004. It was public knowledge that the hearing had begun and the applicants had reporters in Scotland reporting on the progress of the Board. The fact that the hearing moved to Halifax in early November cannot, in the circumstances, be viewed as an anticipated event which would trigger the right to an expedited hearing.",
    "[16]\nSecondly, the respondent disputes the applicants' assertion that this application for judicial review is ready for hearing. The parties agree that this judicial review application raises complicated issues, including constitutional questions concerning freedom of the press under section 2(b) of the Charter. The respondent submits that it also raises issues concerning the status of boards of inquiry, established pursuant to legislation, whose legislative mandate is to investigate and report on facts. According to the respondent, this application therefore has implications not only for this particular Board of Inquiry, but also for similar boards constituted under other legislation.",
    "[17]\nSection 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act establishes a scheme for judicial review of federal administrative tribunals. In furtherance of that scheme, section 18.4 provides that judicial review applications \"shall be heard and determined without delay and in a summary way.\" The timeframes provided by the Rules are designed to give the parties adequate time to prepare the case so that the Court can properly decide the matter before it, thereby rendering justice to the parties, while also respecting the objective of deciding the matter without delay. Any departure from these rules - and especially an abridgement - is exceptional.",
    "[18]\nIn light of the complexity of the issues raised in the application, I find that the respondent would be seriously prejudiced if he were required to rush to deal with this application, particularly within a timeframe which would be of any practical benefit to the applicants. Inadequate preparation time would not only prejudice the respondent, but would also risk compromising the ability of the Court to adjudicate this matter properly by requiring it to decide significant matters without the benefit of proper material before it. As O'Keefe' J. observed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) at para. 3.:\n. . . I would not grant the short leave request pursuant to the Federal Court Rules for the hearing of this application. The matters are complicated and in this case the Respondent should be allowed to file its materials and take the steps allowed by the rules. In fact, this is necessary in order to allow the Court to properly deal with the issues that are raised in the request.",
    "[19]\nThe denial of the benefit of the timelines in the Rules which would allow the respondent an adequate opportunity to properly prepare its case for determination is not merely a matter of inconvenience for the respondent and the Court. It is matter of prejudice that is not outweighed by the applicants' desire to proceed quickly.",
    "[20]\nThirdly, this matter cannot be viewed as urgent since irreparable harm to the applicants has not been established. The issue of irreparable harm has already been considered by Harrington, J., who rejected the argument and concluded that the Board could continue with its hearings in the applicants' absence. Although the findings of Harrington, J. were made in the context of a motion to stay the Board inquiry, essentially the same facts and arguments are being advanced by the parties on this motion. The stay having been denied on the grounds that there was no irreparable harm, it would be inappropriate for me to revisit the issue.\nConclusion",
    "[21]\nIn summary, I find that the respondent would suffer serious prejudice if the timelines are abridged to the extent necessary to be of any practical benefit to the applicants. I am also unable to conclude that there is sufficient urgency to the application such as to warrant an expedited hearing in the manner proposed by the applicants. The applicants' motion for an immediate hearing of the application must therefore be dismissed.",
    "[22]\nNotwithstanding that the remedy of immediate access to the Board hearing may no longer be practical, the applicants continue to seek access to the transcripts of the hearing, which have not been made public. In order to ensure that the important issues of freedom of speech raised by the applicants can be addressed by this Court in a timely manner, while at the same time protecting the rights of the respondent, I am prepared to direct that the application for judicial review be fixed for hearing at the earliest available date in Halifax.\nORDER",
    "[23]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS\nthat:\n1. The application for judicial review in this matter be heard at the Federal Court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Wednesday, February 9, 2004 at 9:30 a.m.\n2. The motion to abridge the notice periods and all other time requirements associated with an application for judicial review is otherwise dismissed.\n3. To facilitate the expeditious determination of this matter, the application shall continue as a specially managed proceeding.\n4. The schedule for completion of the remaining steps in the proceeding is as follows:\n(a) The certified record of the tribunal shall be served and filed by November 29, 2004.\n(b) The respondent shall serve and file the respondent's affidavit evidence no later than December 13, 2004.\n(c) The parties shall complete cross-examinations by December 20, 2005.\n(d) The applicants shall serve and file the applicants' application record no later than January 10, 2005.\n(e) The respondent shall serve and file his application record by January 31, 2005.\n5.

    "factual_background": [
      "A journalist and a broadcasting corporation (applicants) sought access to proceedings of a Board of Inquiry convened by the Canadian Forces.",
      "The Board of Inquiry was investigating the death and casualties onboard the HMCS Chicoutimi on October 5, 2004.",
      "The Board was tasked with completing its investigation and reporting by November 30, 2004, and conducted hearings in Scotland and Halifax.",
      "The applicants initially requested access to the Halifax hearings on November 2, 2004, which was denied.",
      "The applicants then formally applied for access or the opportunity to make representations, pursuant to Section 12 of the Board of Inquiries Terms of Reference.",
      "The President of the Board denied immediate access and oral submissions but agreed to accept written representations.",
      "Following submission of written materials, the Board denied the applicants access, citing its status as an internal investigation and concerns about delays.",
      "The applicants filed an application for judicial review and a motion for a stay of the Board's proceedings, alleging Charter rights violations.",
      "A judge dismissed the stay motion, finding no serious issue, irreparable harm, or balance of convenience in the applicants' favour.",
      "The applicants then brought a motion to expedite the judicial review hearing.",
      "The Board began its proceedings on October 8, 2004, with initial testimony taken in Scotland starting October 11, 2004."

    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "The Board's decision infringed their section 2(b) Charter right to freedom of expression.",
        "Access to the Board hearings is the only remedy that alleviates the alleged infringement of their Charter rights.",
        "Expediting the hearing is necessary to ensure a remedy is available.",
        "The balance of convenience favours abridging time to protect their and the public's right to free expression.",
        "The respondent could limit themselves to already filed affidavit evidence.",
        "Cross-examination on affidavits could be dispensed with.",
        "The respondent should be required to serve and file the record immediately.",
        "They seek access to transcripts of the hearing that have not been made public."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The application for judicial review raises complicated issues, including constitutional questions concerning freedom of the press under section 2(b) of the Charter.",
        "The application also raises issues concerning the status of boards of inquiry established by legislation.",
        "The application has implications for similar boards constituted under other legislation.",
        "Abridging time would prejudice their ability to adequately prepare their case.",
        "Inadequate preparation time would compromise the Court's ability to properly adjudicate the matter.",
        "The matter is not urgent, as the applicants delayed requesting access until the first week of November despite the hearings beginning in October.",
        "The applicants have already missed the opportunity to seek access to a significant portion of the inquiry."
      ]
    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The court denied the applicants' request to abridge the timelines under the Federal Court Rules, finding they had not demonstrated sufficient urgency or established that the respondent would not be prejudiced.",
      "The court reasoned that the applicants created an 'artificial sense of urgency' by delaying their request for access until after the Board of Inquiry had already begun its proceedings, including testimony taken in Scotland, which was publicly known.",
      "The court emphasized that Rule 8(1) of the Federal Court Rules allows for abridgement of time only when urgency is established *and* the respondent won't be prejudiced, citing precedent for this dual requirement.",
      "The court determined the application involved complex constitutional issues concerning freedom of the press (s. 2(b) Charter) and the status of boards of inquiry, necessitating adequate preparation time for the respondent.",
      "The court interpreted s. 18.1 and 18.4 of the Federal Courts Act, which mandate a 'summary' and 'without delay' hearing of judicial review applications, as being balanced against the need for adequate preparation to ensure a just outcome, and that exceptional circumstances are required to depart from the established rules.",
      "The court deferred to the previous decision of Harrington J. who found no irreparable harm resulting from the denial of access to the hearings, deeming it inappropriate to revisit that finding.",
      "The court acknowledged the importance of the Charter rights at issue and, while denying immediate access, scheduled the judicial review application for a hearing on February 9, 2005, in Halifax, and designated it a 'specially managed proceeding' with a defined schedule for filing evidence and records to ensure a timely resolution.",
      "The court concluded that the respondent would suffer serious prejudice if forced to rush preparation, and that this prejudice outweighed the applicants’ desire for a quicker hearing, particularly as the immediate remedy of access to the live hearing was no longer practical."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The application to abridge the notice periods and all other time requirements associated with an application for judicial review is dismissed.",
      "The application for judicial review is to be heard at the Federal Court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Wednesday, February 9, 2004, at 9:30 a.m.",
      "The application shall continue as a specially managed proceeding.",
      "The certified record of the tribunal shall be served and filed by November 29, 2004.",
      "The respondent shall serve and file the respondent's affidavit evidence no later than December 13, 2004.",
      "The parties shall complete cross-examinations by December 20, 2005.",
      "The applicants shall serve and file the applicants' application record no later than January 10, 2005.",
      "The respondent shall serve and file his application record by January 31, 2005.",
      "There shall be no order as to costs of the motion."
