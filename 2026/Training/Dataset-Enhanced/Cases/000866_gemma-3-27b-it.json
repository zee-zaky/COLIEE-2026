Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nKelen, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a decision by a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) Officer, dated March 10, 2009, denying the applicants' application for protection because they failed to their provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a fear of personalized risk.\nFACTS\nBackground",
    "[2]\nThe applicants are citizens of South Africa. Forty-one (41) year old Melody Angel Cromhout is the principal applicant. She is married to forty-five year (45) year Jeff Colyn Cromhout, who is an applicant. Their children, thirteen (13) year old Angel Cromhout and nine (9) year old Mary, are the minor applicants.",
    "[3]\nThe applicant family entered Canada on March 8, 2004. The applicants claimed refugee status over a year later on September 28, 2005. They failed to appear for their refugee hearing in front of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board on October 16, 2007 and the subsequent abandonment hearing on January 2, 2008.",
    "[4]\nThe applicants failed to appear for a pre-removal interview on April 28, 2008. The applicants' counsel was allegedly unlicensed and failed to inform the applicants' of their appearance dates. A warrant was issued for the applicants' arrest on May 1, 2008 and executed upon the arrest of Ms. Cromhout on September11, 2008.",
    "[5]\nThe applicants filed two PRRAs on November 19, 2008, one for Ms. Cromhout and one for Mr. Cromhout. Both included their dependent children in their applications.",
    "[6]\nBoth PRRAs were denied on March 10, 2009 in a single decision. The applicant filed for leave to appeal the PRRA decision.",
    "[7]\nOn June 23, 2009 this Court stayed the execution of the deportation order. Leave was granted by this Court on August 4, 2009.\nDecision under review",
    "[8]\nThe applicants based their PRRAs on the Cromhout parents' combined traumas in South Africa. These traumas allegedly constituted \"compelling reasons\" per s. 108(4) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), which would justify an exception from the requirement to prove future persecution.",
    "[9]\nMs. Cromhout's application was based on her past physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her father, and the failure of the South African state to protect her as a child or as an adult. Ms. Cromhout's counsel submitted that Ms. Cromhout's trauma informs her failure to appear before the Board once she became disillusioned with her previous counsel's incompetence. The PRRA officer was asked to apply the doctrine of compelling reasons in light of Ms. Cromhout's history in South Africa and consider Ms. Cromhout's failure to attend the refugee and abandonment Board hearings with a view to the IRB Gender Guidelines.",
    "[10]\nMs. Cromhout submitted a lifetime chronology of incidents of abuse by her father and the consequent failure of the state to offer protection or assistance. It was submitted that incidents of abuse could reoccur should Ms. Cromhout return to South Africa. Ms. Cromhout submitted that she lives in fear of her children ever living in the same country as their grandfather.",
    "[11]\nMr. Cromhout's application was based on the trauma he experienced from serving on the South Africa Police force. Counsel at the hearing before the Court did not proceed with the case on behalf of Mr. Cromhout because there was no evidence to find him in need of protection.",
    "[12]\nThe officer accepted that Ms. Cromhout may have been abused in South Africa. The officer concluded that the principal applicant failed to provide sufficient objective evidence to support their fear of risk in South Africa.",
    "[13]\nThe PRRA officer held that the applicants failed to provide a reasonable explanation for their failure to attend any of the hearings in front of the Board. The PRRA officer found that the applicants could not impugn their previous counsel's competence without providing proof that the aforementioned counsel was provided with notice of the allegations. The PRRA officer considered the gender guidelines but found that they did not explain the applicants' failure to attend the Board hearings.",
    "[14]\nThe PRRA officer considered counsel's submissions on the doctrine of compelling reasons but determined that there was no evidence on the record to trigger the application of s. 108(4) of IRPA given the failure of the applicant to submit medical or psychological reports regarding her trauma.",
    "[15]\nThe officer further found that there was no evidence that the minor applicants, who were 8 and 4 years old respectively when they came to Canada, had ever been in contact with Ms. Cromhout's father or suffered abuse, and would be at risk if returned to South Africa.\nLEGISLATION",
    "[16]\nSection 96 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n(IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, confers protection upon persons who are Convention refugees:\n96\n.\nA Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(\na\n) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(\nb\n) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:\na\n) soit se trouve hors de tout pays don't elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;\nb) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.",
    "[17]\nSection 97 of IRPA confers protection to persons who may be at a personalized risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or at risk of torture:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(\nhas\n) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(\nb\n) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n97. (1) As a person to protect, a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he has nationality or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\nhas\n) or at risk, if there are serious grounds to believe so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.",
    "[18]\nSubsection 108(1)(e) of IRPA states that a refugee or protection claim shall be rejected if the reason which the claim was made has ceased to exist:\n108. (1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n...\n(\ne\n) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\n108. (1) Est rejetée la demande d'asile et le demandeur n'a pas qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger dans tel des cas suivants:\n...\ne) les raisons qui lui ont fait demander l'asile n'existent plus.",
    "[19]\nSubsection 108(4) of IRPA provides an exception to the general rule in s.108(1)(e) of IRPA if the claimant establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of the claimant's past experiences:\n(4) Paragraph (1)(\ne\n) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\n(4) L'alinéa (1)\ne\n) ne s'applique pas si le demandeur prouve qu'il y a des raisons impérieuses, tenant à des persécutions, à la torture ou à des traitements ou peines antérieurs, de refuser de se réclamer de la protection du pays qu'il a quitté ou hors duquel il est demeuré.",
    "[20]\nSubsection 113(b) allows the Minister to hold a PRRA hearing:\n113. Consideration of an application for protection shall be as follows:\n...\n(\nb\n) a hearing may be held if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required;\n113. Il est disposé de la demande comme il suit:\n...\nb) une audience peut être tenue si le ministre l'estime requis compte tenu des facteurs réglementaires;",
    "[21]\nSubsection 167 of the IRPR sets out the factors the Minister must consider before deciding if a PRRA hearing is required:\n167. For the purpose of determining whether a hearing is required under paragraph 113(\nb\n) of the Act, the factors are the following:\n(\nhas\n) whether there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility and is related to the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act;\n(\nb\n) whether the evidence is central to the decision with respect to the application for protection; and\n(\nc\n) whether the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection.\n167. For the application of paragraph 113\nb\n) of the Act, the following factors are used to decide whether a hearing is required:\nhas\n) the existence of evidence relating to the elements mentioned in sections 96 and 97 of the Act which raise a significant question regarding the credibility of the applicant;\n(b) the importance of this evidence for the decision on the application for protection;\n(c) whether such evidence, if admitted, would justify the granting of protection.\nOUTCOMES",
    "[22]\nThe applicant raises the following four issues:\nA. Is there any evidence which supports the applicants' submissions with respect to the issues set out below?\n1. Is there an obligation to advise an immigration counsel who is not licensed regarding allegations of incompetence?\n2. Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in rejecting the credibility of the applicants without an oral hearing?\n3. Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction in relation to s. 108 (4) (\"compelling reasons\")?\n4. Did the officer err in fact or err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in failing to determine the issue of state protection?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW",
    "[23]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 1, the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 62 that the first step in conducting a standard of review analysis is to \"ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of (deference) to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question (see\nalso  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Binnie at paragraph 53).\"",
    "[24]\nThe first two issues involve procedural fairness and questions of law and as such are reviewable on a correctness standard (see specifically regarding the obligation to give notice of an allegation of incompetence to counsel:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Per Justice Heneghan at paragraph 13;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Dawson at paragraph 14; specifically regarding the requirement to hold a hearing:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Russell at paragraph 31;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Lemieux at paragraph 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Phelan; and my decision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[25]\nThe PRRA officer's finding that the Mr. and Ms. Cromhout's experiences did not rise to the level of \"compelling reasons\" under section 108(4) is a finding of fact or mixed law and fact, and is subject to a standard of review of reasonableness (see my decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> citing\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2005 FC 822, 140 A.C.W.S. (3d) 354, per Justice Mosley at paragraph 5).",
    "[26]\nThe last issue concerns the adequate provision of reasons, which touches upon procedural fairness and therefore reviewable on a correctness standard of review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Justice Dawson at paragraph 24).",
    "[27]\nIn reviewing the officer's decision using a standard of reasonableness, the Court will consider \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\" and \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at paragraph 59).\nANALYSIS",
    "[28]\nBefore discussing the issues raised by the principal applicant, the Court finds that the PRRA officer dismissed this application because there was insufficient evidence of a serious risk to the applicants if deported to South Africa. The Court concludes that this finding was reasonably open to the PRRA officer.\nIssue No. 1\n: Is there an obligation to advise an immigration counsel who is not licensed regarding allegations of incompetence?",
    "[29]\nThe applicants submit that the officer erred in law in holding that there is an obligation to advise an immigration consultant who is not licensed regarding allegations of incompetence. The applicants argue that this case is distinguishable from the leading case law on this issue because the consultant in this case was unlicensed, so there was no governing body to which the applicants could have complained to.",
    "[30]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Teitelbaum at paragraph 31, is the leading case on the issue of giving counsel notice of allegations of incompetence made against them. In\nShirvan\n, supra, this Court held at paragraphs. 31-32 that before examining allegations of incompetence, the applicant must meet a preliminary burden to give notice of the allegations to the prior counsel.",
    "[31]\nContrary to the applicants' submission, a letter or complaint to a governing body is not the only notice that will be acceptable to this Court as a pre-condition to examining counsel's alleged incompetence.",
    "[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice O'Reilly held at paragraph 17 that the requirement to give of notice will be satisfied either when the applicants makes a complaint to a governing body, in that case the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants (CSIC), or when the applicants provide evidence that their consultant was informed of the allegations against them.",
    "[33]\nIt was incumbent upon the applicants, who were represented by new counsel when they applied for a PRRA, to send a letter to their immigration consultant to advise them of the allegations of incompetence made against them in the PRRA submissions. The onus is on the applicants to provide the necessary evidence to support their claim. The officer was under no obligation to alert the applicants to the requirement to provide evidence of notice to their immigration consultant.",
    "[34]\nThe officer interpreted the law correctly when he determined that the applicants' allegations of inadequate counsel at the time of their Board hearings could not be considered because of the failure to give notice.\nIssue No. 2\n: Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in rejecting the credibility of the applicants without an oral hearing?",
    "[35]\nThe applicants submit that the officer made a negative credibility finding based on the applicant's failure to provide a reasonable explanation for the failure to attend any of the Board hearings. The officer exceeded his jurisdiction by making a credibility finding without the benefit of an oral hearing pursuant to subsection 113(b) of IRPA section 167 of the IRPR.",
    "[36]\nSection 167 of the IRPR and subsection 113 (b) of IRPA set out the requirements for holding an oral hearing in a PRRA. Compliance with all three subparagraphs of section 167 indicates that a hearing\nmay\nbe required (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Shore, at paragraph 12) (emphasis in original). In other words, where the requirements in section 167 are complied with, a presumption in favour of an oral hearing is raised ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at paragraphs 20-21). However, there is no statutory obligation to conduct a hearing.",
    "[37]\nThere is also no statutory duty to conduct an oral hearing when an officer moves to assess the weight or probative value of evidence without considering whether it is credible (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Zinn, at paragraphs 26-27).",
    "[38]\nThe requirements of section 167 of the IRPR are not met in this case. The PRRA officer clearly stated that the applicant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove her fear of risk. The applicant did not provide any evidence to support her allegations of risk or trauma. The officer's comments on the applicant's failure to provide an excuse for not appearing in front of the Board bore no influence on the final disposition of the PRRA. There is no ambiguity in the officer's reasons that could lead this Court to hold that the officer failed to differentiate between findings of insufficiency and credibility.",
    "[39]\nThis ground of review must therefore fail.\nIssue No. 3: Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction in relation to subsection 108 (4) (\"compelling reasons\")?",
    "[40]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred in dismissing the applicant's claim for relief under the \"compelling reasons\" doctrine because she did not provide medical evidence of continuing psychological after-effects from the abuse.",
    "[41]\nThe respondent submits that subsection 108(4) of IRPA is not applicable in the present case because officer did not find that the applicants were Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.",
    "[42]\nThe case law is clear that before a tribunal or officer may embark on a compelling reasons analysis, \"it must first find that there was a valid refugee (or protected person) claim and that the reasons for the claim have ceased to exist (due to changed country conditions)\" (see the following decisions by Justice Layden-Stevenson in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; at paragraph 10;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Snider at paragraph 37). In the absence of a finding of past persecution or risk, subsection 108(4) has no application.",
    "[43]\nThe applicants in this case failed to satisfy the officer that they feared risk in South Africa. The officer was not unreasonable in finding that the applicant's claim was not sufficient to show she feared a risk if they returned to South Africa. Since the applicant was determined to not be a person in need of protection, subsection 108(4) does not apply.",
    "[44]\nThe officer's decision that subsection 108(4) does not apply in this case is reasonable and should not be disturbed.\nIssue No. 4\n: Did the officer err in fact or err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in failing to determine the issue of state protection?",
    "[45]\nThe applicants submit that the PRRA officer erred in rejecting the claim without any consideration or discussion of adequate state protection. The applicants argue the officer's reasons are inadequate in this regard and breach the duty of fairness. This issue does not need to be considered in view of the Court's findings on the other issues.\nCERTIFIED QUESTION",
    "[46]\nBoth parties advised the Court that this case does not raise a serious question of general importance which ought to be certified for an appeal. The Court agrees.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[47]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that:\nThe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n[End of document]"

Forty-one (41) year old Melody Angel Cromhout is the principal applicant. She is married to forty-five year (45) year Jeff Colyn Cromhout, who is an applicant. Their children, thirteen (13) year old Angel Cromhout and nine (9) year old Mary, are the minor applicants.\n[3]\nThe applicant family entered Canada on March 8, 2004.

The applicant filed for leave to appeal the PRRA decision.\n[7]\nOn June 23, 2009 this Court stayed the execution of the deportation order. Leave was granted by this Court on August 4, 2009.\nDecision under review\n[8]\nThe applicants based their PRRAs on the Cromhout parents' combined traumas in South Africa. These traumas allegedly constituted \"compelling reasons\" per s. 108(4) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), which would justify an exception from the requirement to prove future persecution.\n[9]\nMs. Cromhout's application was based on her past physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her father, and the failure of the South African state to protect her as a child or as an adult.

(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(\na\n) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(\nb\n) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays don't elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:\na\n) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;\nb) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:\n(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,\n(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,\n(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,\n(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.\n[18]\nSubsection 108(1)(e) of IRPA states that a refugee or protection claim shall be rejected if the reason which the claim was made has ceased to exist:\n108. (1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n...\n(\ne\n) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\n108.

For the purpose of determining whether a hearing is required under paragraph 113(\nb\n) of the Act, the factors are the following:\n(\na\n) whether there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility and is related to the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act;\n(\nb\n) whether the evidence is central to the decision with respect to the application for protection; and\n(\nc\n) whether the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection.\n167. Pour l'application de l'alinéa 113\nb\n) de la Loi, les facteurs ci-après servent à décider si la tenue d'une audience est requise:\na\n) l'existence d'éléments de preuve relatifs aux éléments mentionnés aux articles 96 et 97 de la Loi qui soulèvent une question importante en ce qui concerne la crédibilité du demandeur;\nb) l'importance de ces éléments de preuve pour la prise de la décision relative à la demande de protection;\nc) la question de savoir si ces éléments de preuve, à supposer qu'ils soient admis, justifieraient que soit accordée la protection.\nISSUES\n[22]\nThe applicant raises the following four issues:\nA. Is there any evidence which supports the applicants' submissions with respect to the issues set out below?\n1. Is there an obligation to advise an immigration counsel who is not licensed regarding allegations of incompetence?\n2. Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in rejecting the credibility of the applicants without an oral hearing?\n3. Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction in relation to s. 108 (4) (\"compelling reasons\")?\n4. Did the officer err in fact or err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in failing to determine the issue of state protection?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[23]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 1, the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 62 that the first step in conducting a standard of review analysis is to \"ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of (deference) to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question (see\nalso  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Binnie at paragraph 53).\"\n[24]\nThe first two issues involve procedural fairness and questions of law and as such are reviewable on a correctness standard (see specifically regarding the obligation to give notice of an allegation of incompetence to counsel:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Per Justice Heneghan at paragraph 13;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Dawson at paragraph 14; specifically regarding the requirement to hold a hearing:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Russell at paragraph 31;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Lemieux at paragraph 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Phelan; and my decision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[25]\nThe PRRA officer's finding that the Mr. and Ms. Cromhout's experiences did not rise to the level of \"compelling reasons\" under section 108(4) is a finding of fact or mixed law and fact, and is subject to a standard of review of reasonableness (see my decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> citing\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2005 FC 822, 140 A.C.W.S. (3d) 354, per Justice Mosley at paragraph 5).\n[26]\nThe last issue concerns the adequate provision of reasons, which touches upon procedural fairness and therefore reviewable on a correctness standard of review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Justice Dawson at paragraph 24).\n[27]\nIn reviewing the officer's decision using a standard of reasonableness, the Court will consider \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\" and \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at paragraph 59).\nANALYSIS\n[28]\nBefore discussing the issues raised by the principal applicant, the Court finds that the PRRA officer dismissed this application because there was insufficient evidence of a serious risk to the applicants if deported to South Africa. The Court concludes that this finding was reasonably open to the PRRA officer.\nIssue No. 1\n: Is there an obligation to advise an immigration counsel who is not licensed regarding allegations of incompetence?\n[29]\nThe applicants submit that the officer erred in law in holding that there is an obligation to advise an immigration consultant who is not licensed regarding allegations of incompetence. The applicants argue that this case is distinguishable from the leading case law on this issue because the consultant in this case was unlicensed, so there was no governing body to which the applicants could have complained to.\n[30]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Teitelbaum at paragraph 31, is the leading case on the issue of giving counsel notice of allegations of incompetence made against them. In\nShirvan\n, supra, this Court held at paragraphs. 31-32 that before examining allegations of incompetence, the applicant must meet a preliminary burden to give notice of the allegations to the prior counsel.\n[31]\nContrary to the applicants' submission, a letter or complaint to a governing body is not the only notice that will be acceptable to this Court as a pre-condition to examining counsel's alleged incompetence.\n[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice O'Reilly held at paragraph 17 that the requirement to give of notice will be satisfied either when the applicants makes a complaint to a governing body, in that case the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants (CSIC), or when the applicants provide evidence that their consultant was informed of the allegations against them.\n[33]\nIt was incumbent upon the applicants, who were represented by new counsel when they applied for a PRRA, to send a letter to their immigration consultant to advise them of the allegations of incompetence made against them in the PRRA submissions. The onus is on the applicants to provide the necessary evidence to support their claim. The officer was under no obligation to alert the applicants to the requirement to provide evidence of notice to their immigration consultant.\n[34]\nThe officer interpreted the law correctly when he determined that the applicants' allegations of inadequate counsel at the time of their Board hearings could not be considered because of the failure to give notice.\nIssue No. 2\n: Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in rejecting the credibility of the applicants without an oral hearing?\n[35]\nThe applicants submit that the officer made a negative credibility finding based on the applicant's failure to provide a reasonable explanation for the failure to attend any of the Board hearings. The officer exceeded his jurisdiction by making a credibility finding without the benefit of an oral hearing pursuant to subsection 113(b) of IRPA section 167 of the IRPR.\n[36]\nSection 167 of the IRPR and subsection 113 (b) of IRPA set out the requirements for holding an oral hearing in a PRRA. Compliance with all three subparagraphs of section 167 indicates that a hearing\nmay\nbe required (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Shore, at paragraph 12) (emphasis in original). In other words, where the requirements in section 167 are complied with, a presumption in favour of an oral hearing is raised ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at paragraphs 20-21). However, there is no statutory obligation to conduct a hearing.\n[37]\nThere is also no statutory duty to conduct an oral hearing when an officer moves to assess the weight or probative value of evidence without considering whether it is credible (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Zinn, at paragraphs 26-27).\n[38]\nThe requirements of section 167 of the IRPR are not met in this case. The PRRA officer clearly stated that the applicant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove her fear of risk. The applicant did not provide any evidence to support her allegations of risk or trauma. The officer's comments on the applicant's failure to provide an excuse for not appearing in front of the Board bore no influence on the final disposition of the PRRA. There is no ambiguity in the officer's reasons that could lead this Court to hold that the officer failed to differentiate between findings of insufficiency and credibility.\n[39]\nThis ground of review must therefore fail.\nIssue No. 3: Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction in relation to subsection 108 (4) (\"compelling reasons\")?\n[40]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred in dismissing the applicant's claim for relief under the \"compelling reasons\" doctrine because she did not provide medical evidence of continuing psychological after-effects from the abuse.\n[41]\nThe respondent submits that subsection 108(4) of IRPA is not applicable in the present case because officer did not find that the applicants were Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[42]\nThe case law is clear that before a tribunal or officer may embark on a compelling reasons analysis, \"it must first find that there was a valid refugee (or protected person) claim and that the reasons for the claim have ceased to exist (due to changed country conditions)\" (see the following decisions by Justice Layden-Stevenson in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; at paragraph 10;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Snider at paragraph 37). In the absence of a finding of past persecution or risk, subsection 108(4) has no application.\n[43]\nThe applicants in this case failed to satisfy the officer that they feared risk in South Africa. The officer was not unreasonable in finding that the applicant's claim was not sufficient to show she feared a risk if they returned to South Africa. Since the applicant was determined to not be a person in need of protection, subsection 108(4) does not apply.\n[44]\nThe officer's decision that subsection 108(4) does not apply in this case is reasonable and should not be disturbed.\nIssue No. 4\n: Did the officer err in fact or err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in failing to determine the issue of state protection?\n[45]\nThe applicants submit that the PRRA officer erred in rejecting the claim without any consideration or discussion of adequate state protection. The applicants argue the officer's reasons are inadequate in this regard and breach the duty of fairness. This issue does not need to be considered in view of the Court's findings on the other issues.\nCERTIFIED QUESTION\n[46]\nBoth parties advised the Court that this case does not raise a serious question of general importance which ought to be certified for an appeal. The Court agrees.\nJUDGMENT\n[47]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that:\nThe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n[End of document]",

Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nKelen, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a decision by a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) Officer, dated March 10, 2009, denying the applicants' application for protection because they failed to their provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a fear of personalized risk.\nFACTS\nBackground\n\n[2]\nThe applicants are citizens of South Africa. Forty-one (41) year old Melody Angel Cromhout is the principal applicant. She is married to forty-five year (45) year Jeff Colyn Cromhout, who is an applicant. Their children, thirteen (13) year old Angel Cromhout and nine (9) year old Mary, are the minor applicants.\n\n[3]\nThe applicant family entered Canada on March 8, 2004. The applicants claimed refugee status over a year later on September 28, 2005. They failed to appear for their refugee hearing in front of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board on October 16, 2007 and the subsequent abandonment hearing on January 2, 2008.\n\n[4]\nThe applicants failed to appear for a pre-removal interview on April 28, 2008. The applicants' counsel was allegedly unlicensed and failed to inform the applicants' of their appearance dates. A warrant was issued for the applicants' arrest on May 1, 2008 and executed upon the arrest of Ms. Cromhout on September11, 2008.\n\n[5]\nThe applicants filed two PRRAs on November 19, 2008, one for Ms. Cromhout and one for Mr. Cromhout. Both included their dependent children in their applications.\n\n[6]\nBoth PRRAs were denied on March 10, 2009 in a single decision. The applicant filed for leave to appeal the PRRA decision.\n\n[7]\nOn June 23, 2009 this Court stayed the execution of the deportation order. Leave was granted by this Court on August 4, 2009.\nDecision under review\n\n[8]\nThe applicants based their PRRAs on the Cromhout parents' combined traumas in South Africa. These traumas allegedly constituted \"compelling reasons\" per s. 108(4) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), which would justify an exception from the requirement to prove future persecution.\n\n[9]\nMs. Cromhout's application was based on her past physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her father, and the failure of the South African state to protect her as a child or as an adult. Ms. Cromhout's counsel submitted that Ms. Cromhout's trauma informs her failure to appear before the Board once she became disillusioned with her previous counsel's incompetence. The PRRA officer was asked to apply the doctrine of compelling reasons in light of Ms. Cromhout's history in South Africa and consider Ms. Cromhout's failure to attend the refugee and abandonment Board hearings with a view to the IRB Gender Guidelines.\n\n[10]\nMs. Cromhout submitted a lifetime chronology of incidents of abuse by her father and the consequent failure of the state to offer protection or assistance. It was submitted that incidents of abuse could reoccur should Ms. Cromhout return to South Africa. Ms. Cromhout submitted that she lives in fear of her children ever living in the same country as their grandfather.\n\n[11]\nMr. Cromhout's application was based on the trauma he experienced from serving on the South Africa Police force. Counsel at the hearing before the Court did not proceed with the case on behalf of Mr. Cromhout because there was no evidence to find him in need of protection.\n\n[12]\nThe officer accepted that Ms. Cromhout may have been abused in South Africa. The officer concluded that the principal applicant failed to provide sufficient objective evidence to support their fear of risk in South Africa.\n\n[13]\nThe PRRA officer held that the applicants failed to provide a reasonable explanation for their failure to attend any of the hearings in front of the Board. The PRRA officer found that the applicants could not impugn their previous counsel's competence without providing proof that the aforementioned counsel was provided with notice of the allegations. The PRRA officer considered the gender guidelines but found that they did not explain the applicants' failure to attend the Board hearings.\n\n[14]\nThe PRRA officer considered counsel's submissions on the doctrine of compelling reasons but determined that there was no evidence on the record to trigger the application of s. 108(4) of IRPA given the failure of the applicant to submit medical or psychological reports regarding her trauma.\n\n[15]\nThe officer further found that there was no evidence that the minor applicants, who were 8 and 4 years old respectively when they came to Canada, had ever been in contact with Ms. Cromhout's father or suffered abuse, and would be at risk if returned to South Africa.\nLEGISLATION\n\n[16]\nSection 96 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n(IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, confers protection upon persons who are Convention refugees:\n96\n.\nA Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(\na\n) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(\nb\n) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:\na\n) soit se trouve hors de tout pays don't elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;\nb) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.\n\n[17]\nSection 97 of IRPA confers protection to persons who may be at a personalized risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or at risk of torture:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(\nhas\n) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(\nb\n) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n97. (1) As a person to protect, a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he has nationality or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\nhas\n) or at risk, if there are serious grounds to believe so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\n\n[18]\nSubsection 108(1)(e) of IRPA states that a refugee or protection claim shall be rejected if the reason which the claim was made has ceased to exist:\n108. (1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n...\n(\ne\n) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\n108. (1) Est rejetée la demande d'asile et le demandeur n'a pas qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger dans tel des cas suivants:\n...\ne) les raisons qui lui ont fait demander l'asile n'existent plus.\n\n[19]\nSubsection 108(4) of IRPA provides an exception to the general rule in s.108(1)(e) of IRPA if the claimant establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of the claimant's past experiences:\n(4) Paragraph (1)(\ne\n) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\n(4) L'alinéa (1)\ne\n) ne s'applique pas si le demandeur prouve qu'il y a des raisons impérieuses, tenant à des persécutions, à la torture ou à des traitements ou peines antérieurs, de refuser de se réclamer de la protection du pays qu'il a quitté ou hors duquel il est demeuré.\n\n[20]\nSubsection 113(b) allows the Minister to hold a PRRA hearing:\n113. Consideration of an application for protection shall be as follows:\n...\n(\nb\n) a hearing may be held if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required;\n113. Il est disposé de la demande comme il suit:\n...\nb) une audience peut être tenue si le ministre l'estime requis compte tenu des facteurs réglementaires;\n\n[21]\nSubsection 167 of the IRPR sets out the factors the Minister must consider before deciding if a PRRA hearing is required:\n167. For the purpose of determining whether a hearing is required under paragraph 113(\nb\n) of the Act, the factors are the following:\n(\nhas\n) whether there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility and is related to the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act;\n(\nb\n) whether the evidence is central to the decision with respect to the application for protection; and\n(\nc\n) whether the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection.\n167. For the application of paragraph 113\nb\n) of the Act, the following factors are used to decide whether a hearing is required:\nhas\n) the existence of evidence relating to the elements mentioned in sections 96 and 97 of the Act which raise a significant question regarding the credibility of the applicant;\n(b) the importance of this evidence for the decision on the application for protection;\n(c) whether such evidence, if admitted, would justify the granting of protection.\nOUTCOMES\n\n[22]\nThe applicant raises the following four issues:\nA. Is there any evidence which supports the applicants' submissions with respect to the issues set out below?\n1. Is there an obligation to advise an immigration counsel who is not licensed regarding allegations of incompetence?\n2. Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in rejecting the credibility of the applicants without an oral hearing?\n3. Did the officer err in law or exceed jurisdiction in relation to s. 108 (4) (\"compelling reasons\")?\n4. Did the officer err in fact or err in law or exceed jurisdiction or breach fairness in failing to determine the issue of state protection?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[23]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 1, the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 62 that the first step in conducting a standard of review analysis is to \"ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of (deference) to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question (see\nalso  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Binnie at paragraph 53).\"\n\n[24]\nThe first two issues involve procedural fairness and questions of law and as such are reviewable on a correctness standard (see specifically regarding the obligation to give notice of an allegation of incompetence to counsel:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Per Justice Heneghan at paragraph 13;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Dawson at paragraph 14; specifically regarding the requirement to hold a hearing:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Russell at paragraph 31;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Lemieux at paragraph 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Phelan; and my decision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[25]\nThe PRRA officer's finding that the Mr. and Ms. Cromhout's experiences did not rise to the level of \"compelling reasons\" under section 108(4) is a finding of fact or mixed law and fact, and is subject to a standard of review of reasonableness (see my decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> citing\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2005 FC 822, 140 A.C.W.S.

      "Applicants are citizens of South Africa: Melody Angel Cromhout, Jeff Colyn Cromhout, and their two children (ages 13 and 9).",
      "The family entered Canada on March 8, 2004.",
      "They claimed refugee status on September 28, 2005.",
      "The applicants failed to appear at a Refugee Protection Division (RPD) hearing on October 16, 2007, and a subsequent abandonment hearing on January 2, 2008.",
      "A pre-removal interview scheduled for April 28, 2008, was also missed.",
      "The applicants' initial counsel was allegedly unlicensed and did not inform them of hearing dates.",
      "An arrest warrant was issued on May 1, 2008, and Ms. Cromhout was arrested on September 11, 2008.",
      "Two Pre-Removal Risk Assessments (PRRAs) were filed on November 19, 2008, one for each parent, including their children as dependents.",
      "Both PRRAs were denied on March 10, 2009, due to insufficient evidence of risk.",
      "The applicants sought leave to appeal the PRRA decision.",
      "A deportation order was stayed on June 23, 2009, and leave to appeal was granted on August 4, 2009.",
      "Ms. Cromhout's PRRA was based on past physical and sexual abuse by her father and perceived lack of state protection.",
      "Mr. Cromhout's PRRA was based on trauma experienced while serving in the South Africa Police force, but this claim was later not pursued.",
      "Ms. Cromhout submitted a chronology of abuse incidents and expressed fear of her children being in the same country as their grandfather.",
      "The PRRA officer acknowledged potential past abuse but found insufficient objective evidence of current risk."
    ],
    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "The PRRA officer erred by requiring notice to unlicensed immigration counsel regarding allegations of incompetence, as there was no governing body to which complaints could be made.",
        "The PRRA officer erred by making a negative credibility finding without an oral hearing, violating procedural fairness under IRPA and IRPR.",
        "The PRRA officer erred in dismissing the claim for relief under s. 108(4) (compelling reasons) by requiring medical evidence of ongoing psychological trauma.",
        "The PRRA officer erred by failing to consider the issue of state protection in South Africa.",
        "Ms. Cromhout's trauma from past abuse informs her failure to appear before the Board.",
        "Ms. Cromhout fears re-victimization if returned to South Africa, and fears her children living in the same country as her father.",
        "The PRRA officer should have applied the IRB Gender Guidelines when considering Ms. Cromhout’s failure to attend hearings."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The applicants failed to provide sufficient objective evidence of a fear of risk in South Africa.",
        "The applicants failed to provide a reasonable explanation for their failure to attend Board hearings.",
        "The applicants could not impugn their previous counsel's competence without providing proof of notice of the allegations.",
        "The Gender Guidelines do not explain the applicants’ failure to attend Board hearings.",
        "Subsection 108(4) (compelling reasons) is inapplicable because the applicants were not found to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.",
        "A compelling reasons analysis requires a prior finding of a valid refugee or protected person claim and that the reasons for the claim have ceased to exist.",
        "The PRRA officer was not unreasonable in finding the applicant’s claim insufficient to demonstrate a fear of risk upon return to South Africa."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court dismissed the application for judicial review, finding the PRRA officer's decision to deny protection was reasonable.",
      "The court clarified the standard of review: procedural fairness and questions of law were reviewed on a correctness standard, the 'compelling reasons' finding was reviewed on a reasonableness standard, and adequacy of reasons was reviewed on a correctness standard.",
      "Regarding the issue of unlicensed counsel, the court held the officer correctly interpreted the law; the applicants failed to provide evidence they informed their previous counsel of allegations of incompetence, and a complaint to a governing body wasn't strictly required, but evidence of notice to the counsel *was*.",
      "The court found the officer did not err in making a credibility assessment without an oral hearing because the officer’s decision was based on a lack of sufficient evidence of risk, not a negative credibility finding, and the requirements for a hearing under s. 167 of the IRPR were not met.",
      "The court affirmed that a 'compelling reasons' analysis under s. 108(4) of IRPA is only applicable *after* a finding that the applicant was a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, which was not made in this case. The officer reasonably found the applicant did not demonstrate a fear of risk in South Africa.",
      "The court determined the officer’s reasons were adequate and did not breach the duty of fairness, and therefore the issue of state protection did not need to be considered separately.",
      "The court emphasized that in reviewing for reasonableness, it considers justification, transparency, and intelligibility in the decision-making process, and whether the decision falls within an acceptable range of outcomes."

      "The application for judicial review is dismissed."
