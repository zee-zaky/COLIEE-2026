    "[1]\nTremblay-Lamer, J.\n[Translation]: The applicant, Jean Édouard Conille, has filed an application for judicial review under s. 18 of the\nFederal Court Act\n[see footnote 1] seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the \"Minister\") to process the application for citizenship he filed on August 7, 1995, under the\nCitizenship Act\n[see footnote 2] (the \"\nAct\n\").\nFacts",
    "[2]\nThe applicant comes from Haiti, and was born in 1967. He arrived in Canada in 1973 as a permanent resident. On November 18, 1991, he made his first application for citizenship, which was refused on June 15, 1995 by the citizenship judge Elizabeth Wilcock. The applicant did not meet the residence requirement set out in s. 5(1) of the\nAct\nin that he had been under a probation order for a period of three years ending on August 3, 1991, and in accordance with s. 21 of the\nAct\nthat period could not be taken into account in calculating the length of residence in Canada. The period of probation had been imposed on the applicant after he was convicted of causing death by criminal negligence, on August 3, 1988, contrary to ss. 202 and 203 of the\nCriminal Code\n. [see footnote 3]",
    "[3]\nOn August 7, 1995, the applicant made a new application for citizenship which has not yet received a response. Accordingly, the purpose of this application for judicial review is to obtain an order directing the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to process the application for citizenship.\nThe Parties' Arguments",
    "[4]\nThe applicant contends, first, that the three-year delay since the application for citizenship was made on August 7, 1995, is unreasonable. In his view, the investigation concerning him, which is cited as justification for the delay in processing his case, should have started in December 1994, although the application in question here was filed in August 1995. Under the regulatory procedure, requests for investigations are submitted when the application for citizenship is filed, and do not take three years to be completed. This delay does not comply with the provisions of the\nAct\n, which requires, in mandatory language, that applications be processed promptly and transparently.",
    "[5]\nIn addition, the applicant alleges that the processing of complaints is not legally subject to the authorization of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (\"CSIS\") and accordingly that the powers conferred on the registrar and the citizenship judge have been usurped. The respondent, on the other hand, asserts that the applicant's citizenship application cannot be examined as long as CSIS has not given its authorization. In the applicant's view, this amounts to an unauthorized and illegal delegation of power, since CSIS has no statutory power to authorize or not authorize a citizenship application. Sections 14 and 15 of the\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service Act\n[see footnote 4] only gives CSIS powers to advise the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.",
    "[6]\nWith respect to the delegation of power, the respondent contends that CSIS is involved only as an adviser, supplying the results of its investigation. As set out in the record, the decision-making power is not exercised by CSIS.\nIssue",
    "[7]\nIs issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to process the applicant's citizenship application justified having regard to the allegations of unreasonable delay and usurpation of powers by CSIS?\nAnalysis",
    "[8]\nWe need only briefly recall that issuance of a writ of mandamus is subject to the following conditions precedent:\n(1) there is a public legal duty to the applicant to act;\n(2) the duty must be owed to the applicant;\n(3) there is a clear right to the performance of that duty, in particular:\n(a) the applicant has satisfied all conditions precedent giving rise to the duty;\n(b) there was a prior demand for performance of the duty, a reasonable time to comply with the demand, and a subsequent refusal which can be either expressed or implied, e.g. unreasonable delay; and\n(4) there is no other adequate remedy. [see footnote 5]",
    "[9]\nProcessing of citizenship applications is governed by the\nAct\nand the\nCitizenship Regulations\n[see footnote 6], 1993 (the \"\nRegulations\n\"). In accordance with s. 5(1) of the\nAct\n, the Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who meets the requirements. Section 5(1) reads as follows:\n\"5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n(a) makes application for citizenship;\n(b) is eighteen years of age or over;\n(c) has been lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence, has not ceased since such admission to be a permanent resident pursuant to section 24 of the Immigration Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;\n(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;\n(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; and\n(f) is not under a deportation order and is not the subject of a declaration by the Governor-in-Council made pursuant to section 20.\"",
    "[10]\nSection 11 of the\nRegulations\nprovides that when a citizenship application is filed the registrar is responsible for causing the inquiries necessary for the application of the\nAct\nto be commenced. Section 11 of the\nRegulations\nprovides:\n\"11(1) On receipt of an application made in accordance with subsection 3(1), 6(1), 7(1) or 8(1), the registrar shall cause to be commenced the inquiries necessary to determine whether the person in respect of whom the application is made meets the requirements of the Act and these Regulations with respect to the application.\"",
    "[11]\nThe inquiries referred to in s. 11 are of three types:\n(a) inquiries under s. 5(1) to ascertain that applicants have permanent resident status;\n(b) inquiries under s. 5(1)(f) concerning the declaration by the Governor-in-Council pursuant to s. 20 to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS); and\n(c) inquiries under ss. 21 and 22 of the\nAct\nrelating to the whether the person is under a probation order, is a paroled inmate or is imprisoned.",
    "[12]\nAfter completion of the inquiries commenced, the registrar shall refer the applications to the citizenship judge for consideration in accordance with s. 11(5) of the\nRegulations\n.\n\"11(5) After completion of the inquiries commenced pursuant to subsection (1), the registrar shall\n(a) in the case of an application and materials filed with a citizenship officer in accordance with subsection 3(1), or forwarded to the registrar under subsection 3(3), request the citizenship officer with whom the application and materials have been filed or to whom they have been forwarded under subsection 3(5) to refer the application and materials to a citizenship judge for consideration; and\n(b) in the case of an application and materials filed under subsection 6(1), 7(1) or 8(1), forward the application and materials to a citizenship officer of the citizenship court that the registrar considers appropriate in the circumstances, and request the citizenship officer to refer the application and materials to a citizenship judge for consideration.\"\nNo time limit is provided for completing these inquiries.",
    "[13]\nSection 14 of the\nAct\nsets out the procedure and time limits for processing the case once it has been referred to the judge for consideration.\n\"14(1) An application for\n(a) a grant of citizenship under subsection 5(1),\n(b) a retention of citizenship under section 8,\n(c) a renunciation of citizenship under subsection 9(1), or\n(d) a resumption of citizenship under subsection 11(1)\nshall be considered by a citizenship judge who shall, within sixty days of the day the application was referred to the judge, determine whether or not the person who made the application meets the requirements of this Act and the regulations with respect to the application.\n\"Interruption of proceedings\n\"(1.1) Where an applicant is a permanent resident who is the subject of an inquiry under the Immigration Act, the citizenship judge may not make a determination under subsection (1) until there has been a final determination whether, for the purposes of that Act, a removal order shall be made against that applicant.\n\"Definitions\n\"(1.2) The expressions 'permanent resident' and 'removal order' in subsection (1.1) have the meanings assigned to those expressions by subsection 2(1) of the Immigration Act.\n\"Advice to Minister\n\"(2) Forthwith after making a determination under subsection (1) in respect of an application referred to therein but subject to section 15, the citizenship judge shall approve or not approve the application in accordance with his determination, notify the Minister accordingly and provide the Minister with the reasons therefor.\n\"Notice to applicant\n\"(3) Where a citizenship judge does not approve an application under subsection (2), the judge shall forthwith notify the applicant of his decision, of the reasons therefor and of the right to appeal.\n\"Sufficiency\n\"(4) A notice referred to in subsection (3) is sufficient if it is sent by registered mail to the applicant at his latest known address.\"",
    "[14]\nThus, when the citizenship judge finds that the application meets the requirements, the Minister \"shall\" grant citizenship to any person who meets the requirements therefor. Accordingly, in the instant case, there is a public legal duty owed to the applicant where the requirements are met.",
    "[15]\nIn the instant case, the applicant filed a citizenship application on August 7, 1995, and his application has still not been processed three years later.",
    "[16]\nThe respondent contends that the registrar cannot act as long as the inquiries have not been completed. Accordingly, there is no legal obligation to act as long as the investigation has not been concluded, and consequently issuance of mandamus cannot be justified.",
    "[17]\nOn this point, the respondent bases his argument on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applicant\nLee\nwas seeking a writ of mandamus directing the respondent to proceed with the processing of his case as soon as possible. Lee had asked that his application be processed urgently, and this memorandum had been placed on his file. After obtaining the results of the RCMP investigation concerning his criminal record, the registry had forwarded the file to CSIS on April 11, 1986. On June 26, 1987, CSIS informed the registry that the investigation was still ongoing and that the results were not yet available. One year had passed since the applicant applied for citizenship. Jerome dismissed the application for mandamus, stating that the registrar was not in a position to act as long as the investigation was ongoing:\n\"On the basis of that information, the registrar is not in a position to determine whether the applicant meets the requirements for the grant of citizenship specified in s. 5. On the contrary, while the CSIS investigation is ongoing, preliminary indications are that the applicant may be ineligible for citizenship. It would appear, therefore, that the respondent is acting precisely in conformity with her statutory obligation. The registrar of Citizenship has not determined whether the applicant meets the requirements of the\nAct\nand is therefore under no statutory duty to refer the citizenship application to a citizenship judge. Indeed, in the face of existing information, it is difficult to see how the registrar could permit the matter to get before a citizenship judge without offending the sections of the\nAct\nto which I referred above.\" [see footnote 8]",
    "[18]\nCertainly, some types of investigations may delay processing of citizenship applications.",
    "[19]\nCan they, however, justify an application being indefinitely suspended? In my view, when an applicant prima facie meets the requirements listed in s. 5(1) of the\nAct\n, and there is a demand for performance, the authorities involved have a duty to act. In the instant case, the record does not show that the applicant is under a deportation order and he is no longer the subject of a declaration by the Governor-in-Council made pursuant to s. 20.",
    "[20]\nIt is too easy to argue, as does the respondent, that the registrar has no legal obligation to act as long as the inquiries have not been completed. By that reckoning, an investigation could go on indefinitely and the registrar would never have a duty to act. The difficulty lies essentially in the fact that there is no time limit provided in the\nRegulations\nfor completing these inquiries. In fact, the source of the problem is a defective statutory framework. For one thing, the powers of the registrar to direct that an investigation be conducted in order to ascertain that the requirements of the\nAct\nhave been met are not subject to any temporal or pragmatic parameters, apart from the obligation to await completion of the inquiries provided for in s. 11 of the\nRegulations\n, and for another, no time limits are placed on the powers of the investigators, in this instance CSIS. Given these circumstances, the processing time may extend well beond the time required for conducting the investigation. At what point can that time be regarded as unreasonable?",
    "[21]\nThe reasonableness of the time taken to perform a statutory obligation has been examined in several cases:\nCivil Service Association of Alberta, Branch 45 and Alberta Human Rights Commission et al., Re\n[see footnote 9];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  10] and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Commission\nthe Alberta Supreme Court examined the question of whether a delay in performing a duty warranted issuance of a writ of mandamus. The court dismissed the applicant's case on the ground that the delay was justified because another similar investigation and hearing was under way and the respondent had proceeded reasonably in the performance of its duties, and the delay did not amount to a refusal to perform its duties.",
    "[22] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[23]\nFrom the reasons of the court, it appears that three requirements must be met if a delay is to be considered unreasonable:\n(1) the delay in question has been longer than the nature of the process required, prima facie;\n(2) the applicant and his counsel are not responsible for the delay; and\n(3) the authority responsible for the delay has not provided satisfactory justification.",
    "[24]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [see footnote 12] which the applicant cited in support of his argument, the Federal Court examined an application for a writ of mandamus to direct the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to process an application for permanent residence in Canada. In that case, processing had been delayed by investigations into the parties' bona fides. The court granted mandamus requiring that a decision be made, on the ground that the responsible authority had not adequately justified the delay. In that situation, unreasonable delay amounted to failure to decide. Mr. Justice Strayer stated:\n\"The decision to be taken by a visa officer pursuant to s. 6 of the\nRegulations\nwith respect to issuing an immigrant visa to a sponsored member of the familiy class is an administrative one and the court cannot direct what that decision should be. But mandamus can issue to require that some decision be made. Normally this would arise where there has been a specific refusal to make a decision, but it may also happen where there has been a long delay in the making of a decision without adequate explanation. I believe that to be the case here. The respondents have in the evidence submitted on their behalf suggested a number of general problems which they experience in processing these applications, particularly in New Delhi but they have not provided any precise explanation for the long delays in this case. While I would not presume to fix any uniform length of time as being the limit on what is reasonable, I am satisfied on the basis of the limited information which I have before me that a delay of 4 1/2 years from the time the renewed application was made is unreasonable and on its face amounts to a failure to make a decision.\" [see footnote 13]",
    "[25]\nWhen, as it is in this case, an investigation drags on beyond the normal time for this kind of investigation, it is my opinion that the registrar may inform the investigator that he will consider the investigation to be concluded, unless he is informed, as soon as he considers appropriate, that there are serious reasons to justify continuing it. Unless CSIS indicates otherwise as to the importance of confidentiality, procedural fairness demands that the registrar inform the applicant that an investigation is ongoing, delaying a decision on his citizenship application. In most cases, I do not believe that this kind of requirement could jeopardize the result of the investigation since, as in the instant case and in\nLee,\n[see footnote 14] the applicant is in any event aware that there is an investigation, having brought an application for mandamus in the Federal Court. The applicant would then have an opportunity to initiate other proceedings before the body in question, inter alia through the complaint procedure set out in s. 41 et seq. of the\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service Act\n, [see footnote 15] which provides:\n\"41(1) Any person may make a complaint to the Review Committee with respect to any act or thing done by the Service and the Committee shall, subject to subsection (2), investigate the complaint if,\n(a) the complainant has made a complaint to the Director with respect to that act or thing and the complainant has not received a response within such a period of time as the Committee considers reasonable or is dissatisfied with the response given; and\n(b) the Committee is satisfied that the complaint is not trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith.\"",
    "[26]\nTo allow CSIS to delay the conclusion of its investigation indefinitely, and thereby prevent the registrar from submitting the application to the citizenship judge, amounts, in my view, to usurping the powers conferred on the registrar and the citizenship judge by the\nAct\n.",
    "[27]\nIt is furthermore not surprising that the affidavit of the respondent's representative, Mr. Payette, refers to the practice of waiting for CSIS\nauthorization\nin processing complaints. On this point, he says in his affidavit: [see footnote 16]\n[TRANSLATION] \"12. I have been informed by representatives of CSIS that the applicant's case is still being examined. To date, CSIS has never given its authorization in respect of the citizenship application filed by the applicant on August 7, 1995.\n\"13. The applicant's citizenship application cannot be examined as long as CSIS has not given its authorization for that to be done.\"",
    "[28]\nIn addition, the memoranda in the file reiterate that the application is suspended as long as \"the clearance has not been finalized\". [see footnote 17]",
    "[29]\nThe respondent referred to Mr. Payette's cross-examination [see footnote 18] in which he stated that what he meant was checks. He also referred to a memorandum in the file dated December 7, 1995, in which Mr. Payette, on behalf of Mr. Sabourin, told CSIS that processing of the case would be suspended while awaiting advice from CSIS. [see footnote 19]",
    "[30]\nHowever, having carefully reread the transcript, it appears that Mr. Payette stated several times that he was talking about CSIS giving authorization, and not advice as provided in s. 14 of the\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service\n:\n\"14. The Service may\n(a) advise any minister of the Crown on matters relating to the security of Canada, or\n(b) provide any minister of the Crown with information relating to security matters or criminal activities, that is relevant to the exercise of any power or the performance of any duty or function by that Minister under the Citizenship Act or the Immigration Act.\"",
    "[31]\nIn my opinion, it is apparent on a balance of probabilities that CSIS has usurped the decision-making powers conferred on the registrar and the citizenship judge. Furthermore, I am of the view that the applicant has satisfied the requirements that must be met in order for a writ of mandamus to be issued.\n(1) there is a public legal duty to the applicant, which rests on the registrar and the citizenship judge, to determine and process the application in accordance with the\nAct\nand the\nRegulations\n;\n(2) first, the applicant's application satisfies the\nAct\nand the\nRegulations\nto the extent possible, and second, the time taken by CSIS is unreasonable and amounts to an implied refusal;\n(3) in the instant case, the applicant has no other remedy.\nConclusion",
    "[32]\nThis application for judicial review is allowed.",
    "[33]\nThe registrar shall inform CSIS that unless justification for continuing the investigation is provided as soon as the registrar shall consider appropriate, the investigation will be considered to be closed.",
    "[34]\nIf there are serious reasons to justify continuing the investigation, the registrar shall then inform the applicant that the investigation is continuing and that processing of his application is suspended until the investigation is completed.",
    "[35]\nIf there are no serious reasons or a reply is not received, the registrar shall, on the assumption that the investigation is closed, forward the application to a citizenship judge for the citizenship judge to consider the application and decide it on the merits.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Angela E.

Section 11 of the\nRegulations\nprovides:\n\"11(1) On receipt of an application made in accordance with subsection 3(1), 6(1), 7(1) or 8(1), the registrar shall cause to be commenced the inquiries necessary to determine whether the person in respect of whom the application is made meets the requirements of the Act and these Regulations with respect to the application.\"\n[11]\nThe inquiries referred to in s. 11 are of three types:\n(a) inquiries under s. 5(1) to ascertain that applicants have permanent resident status;\n(b) inquiries under s. 5(1)(f) concerning the declaration by the Governor-in-Council pursuant to s. 20 to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS); and\n(c) inquiries under ss. 21 and 22 of the\nAct\nrelating to the whether the person is under a probation order, is a paroled inmate or is imprisoned.\n[12]\nAfter completion of the inquiries commenced, the registrar shall refer the applications to the citizenship judge for consideration in accordance with s. 11(5) of the\nRegulations\n.\n\"11(5) After completion of the inquiries commenced pursuant to subsection (1), the registrar shall\n(a) in the case of an application and materials filed with a citizenship officer in accordance with subsection 3(1), or forwarded to the registrar under subsection 3(3), request the citizenship officer with whom the application and materials have been filed or to whom they have been forwarded under subsection 3(5) to refer the application and materials to a citizenship judge for consideration; and\n(b) in the case of an application and materials filed under subsection 6(1), 7(1) or 8(1), forward the application and materials to a citizenship officer of the citizenship court that the registrar considers appropriate in the circumstances, and request the citizenship officer to refer the application and materials to a citizenship judge for consideration.\"\nNo time limit is provided for completing these inquiries.\n[13]\nSection 14 of the\nAct\nsets out the procedure and time limits for processing the case once it has been referred to the judge for consideration.\n\"14(1) An application for\n(a) a grant of citizenship under subsection 5(1),\n(b) a retention of citizenship under section 8,\n(c) a renunciation of citizenship under subsection 9(1), or\n(d) a resumption of citizenship under subsection 11(1)\nshall be considered by a citizenship judge who shall, within sixty days of the day the application was referred to the judge, determine whether or not the person who made the application meets the requirements of this Act and the regulations with respect to the application.\n\"Interruption of proceedings\n\"(1.1) Where an applicant is a permanent resident who is the subject of an inquiry under the Immigration Act, the citizenship judge may not make a determination under subsection (1) until there has been a final determination whether, for the purposes of that Act, a removal order shall be made against that applicant.\n\"Definitions\n\"(1.2) The expressions 'permanent resident' and 'removal order' in subsection (1.1) have the meanings assigned to those expressions by subsection 2(1) of the Immigration Act.\n\"Advice to Minister\n\"(2) Forthwith after making a determination under subsection (1) in respect of an application referred to therein but subject to section 15, the citizenship judge shall approve or not approve the application in accordance with his determination, notify the Minister accordingly and provide the Minister with the reasons therefor.\n\"Notice to applicant\n\"(3) Where a citizenship judge does not approve an application under subsection (2), the judge shall forthwith notify the applicant of his decision, of the reasons therefor and of the right to appeal.\n\"Sufficiency\n\"(4) A notice referred to in subsection (3) is sufficient if it is sent by registered mail to the applicant at his latest known address.\"\n[14]\nThus, when the citizenship judge finds that the application meets the requirements, the Minister \"shall\" grant citizenship to any person who meets the requirements therefor. Accordingly, in the instant case, there is a public legal duty owed to the applicant where the requirements are met.\n[15]\nIn the instant case, the applicant filed a citizenship application on August 7, 1995, and his application has still not been processed three years later.\n[16]\nThe respondent contends that the registrar cannot act as long as the inquiries have not been completed. Accordingly, there is no legal obligation to act as long as the investigation has not been concluded, and consequently issuance of mandamus cannot be justified.\n[17]\nOn this point, the respondent bases his argument on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applicant\nLee\nwas seeking a writ of mandamus directing the respondent to proceed with the processing of his case as soon as possible. Lee had asked that his application be processed urgently, and this memorandum had been placed on his file. After obtaining the results of the RCMP investigation concerning his criminal record, the registry had forwarded the file to CSIS on April 11, 1986. On June 26, 1987, CSIS informed the registry that the investigation was still ongoing and that the results were not yet available. One year had passed since the applicant applied for citizenship. Jerome dismissed the application for mandamus, stating that the registrar was not in a position to act as long as the investigation was ongoing:\n\"On the basis of that information, the registrar is not in a position to determine whether the applicant meets the requirements for the grant of citizenship specified in s. 5. On the contrary, while the CSIS investigation is ongoing, preliminary indications are that the applicant may be ineligible for citizenship. It would appear, therefore, that the respondent is acting precisely in conformity with her statutory obligation. The registrar of Citizenship has not determined whether the applicant meets the requirements of the\nAct\nand is therefore under no statutory duty to refer the citizenship application to a citizenship judge. Indeed, in the face of existing information, it is difficult to see how the registrar could permit the matter to get before a citizenship judge without offending the sections of the\nAct\nto which I referred above.\" [see footnote 8]\n[18]\nCertainly, some types of investigations may delay processing of citizenship applications.\n[19]\nCan they, however, justify an application being indefinitely suspended? In my view, when an applicant prima facie meets the requirements listed in s. 5(1) of the\nAct\n, and there is a demand for performance, the authorities involved have a duty to act. In the instant case, the record does not show that the applicant is under a deportation order and he is no longer the subject of a declaration by the Governor-in-Council made pursuant to s. 20.\n[20]\nIt is too easy to argue, as does the respondent, that the registrar has no legal obligation to act as long as the inquiries have not been completed. By that reckoning, an investigation could go on indefinitely and the registrar would never have a duty to act. The difficulty lies essentially in the fact that there is no time limit provided in the\nRegulations\nfor completing these inquiries. In fact, the source of the problem is a defective statutory framework. For one thing, the powers of the registrar to direct that an investigation be conducted in order to ascertain that the requirements of the\nAct\nhave been met are not subject to any temporal or pragmatic parameters, apart from the obligation to await completion of the inquiries provided for in s. 11 of the\nRegulations\n, and for another, no time limits are placed on the powers of the investigators, in this instance CSIS. Given these circumstances, the processing time may extend well beond the time required for conducting the investigation. At what point can that time be regarded as unreasonable?\n[21]\nThe reasonableness of the time taken to perform a statutory obligation has been examined in several cases:\nCivil Service Association of Alberta, Branch 45 and Alberta Human Rights Commission et al., Re\n[see footnote 9];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  10] and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Commission\nthe Alberta Supreme Court examined the question of whether a delay in performing a duty warranted issuance of a writ of mandamus. The court dismissed the applicant's case on the ground that the delay was justified because another similar investigation and hearing was under way and the respondent had proceeded reasonably in the performance of its duties, and the delay did not amount to a refusal to perform its duties.\n[23]\nFrom the reasons of the court, it appears that three requirements must be met if a delay is to be considered unreasonable:\n(1) the delay in question has been longer than the nature of the process required, prima facie;\n(2) the applicant and his counsel are not responsible for the delay; and\n(3) the authority responsible for the delay has not provided satisfactory justification.\n[24]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [see footnote 12] which the applicant cited in support of his argument, the Federal Court examined an application for a writ of mandamus to direct the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to process an application for permanent residence in Canada. In that case, processing had been delayed by investigations into the parties' bona fides. The court granted mandamus requiring that a decision be made, on the ground that the responsible authority had not adequately justified the delay. In that situation, unreasonable delay amounted to failure to decide. Mr. Justice Strayer stated:\n\"The decision to be taken by a visa officer pursuant to s. 6 of the\nRegulations\nwith respect to issuing an immigrant visa to a sponsored member of the familiy class is an administrative one and the court cannot direct what that decision should be. But mandamus can issue to require that some decision be made. Normally this would arise where there has been a specific refusal to make a decision, but it may also happen where there has been a long delay in the making of a decision without adequate explanation. I believe that to be the case here. The respondents have in the evidence submitted on their behalf suggested a number of general problems which they experience in processing these applications, particularly in New Delhi but they have not provided any precise explanation for the long delays in this case. While I would not presume to fix any uniform length of time as being the limit on what is reasonable, I am satisfied on the basis of the limited information which I have before me that a delay of 4 1/2 years from the time the renewed application was made is unreasonable and on its face amounts to a failure to make a decision.\" [see footnote 13]\n[25]\nWhen, as it is in this case, an investigation drags on beyond the normal time for this kind of investigation, it is my opinion that the registrar may inform the investigator that he will consider the investigation to be concluded, unless he is informed, as soon as he considers appropriate, that there are serious reasons to justify continuing it. Unless CSIS indicates otherwise as to the importance of confidentiality, procedural fairness demands that the registrar inform the applicant that an investigation is ongoing, delaying a decision on his citizenship application. In most cases, I do not believe that this kind of requirement could jeopardize the result of the investigation since, as in the instant case and in\nLee,\n[see footnote 14] the applicant is in any event aware that there is an investigation, having brought an application for mandamus in the Federal Court. The applicant would then have an opportunity to initiate other proceedings before the body in question, inter alia through the complaint procedure set out in s. 41 et seq. of the\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service Act\n, [see footnote 15] which provides:\n\"41(1) Any person may make a complaint to the Review Committee with respect to any act or thing done by the Service and the Committee shall, subject to subsection (2), investigate the complaint if,\n(a) the complainant has made a complaint to the Director with respect to that act or thing and the complainant has not received a response within such a period of time as the Committee considers reasonable or is dissatisfied with the response given; and\n(b) the Committee is satisfied that the complaint is not trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith.\"\n[26]\nTo allow CSIS to delay the conclusion of its investigation indefinitely, and thereby prevent the registrar from submitting the application to the citizenship judge, amounts, in my view, to usurping the powers conferred on the registrar and the citizenship judge by the\nAct\n.\n[27]\nIt is furthermore not surprising that the affidavit of the respondent's representative, Mr. Payette, refers to the practice of waiting for CSIS\nauthorization\nin processing complaints. On this point, he says in his affidavit: [see footnote 16]\n[TRANSLATION] \"12. I have been informed by representatives of CSIS that the applicant's case is still being examined. To date, CSIS has never given its authorization in respect of the citizenship application filed by the applicant on August 7, 1995.\n\"13. The applicant's citizenship application cannot be examined as long as CSIS has not given its authorization for that to be done.\"\n[28]\nIn addition, the memoranda in the file reiterate that the application is suspended as long as \"the clearance has not been finalized\". [see footnote 17]\n[29]\nThe respondent referred to Mr. Payette's cross-examination [see footnote 18] in which he stated that what he meant was checks. He also referred to a memorandum in the file dated December 7, 1995, in which Mr. Payette, on behalf of Mr. Sabourin, told CSIS that processing of the case would be suspended while awaiting advice from CSIS. [see footnote 19]\n[30]\nHowever, having carefully reread the transcript, it appears that Mr. Payette stated several times that he was talking about CSIS giving authorization, and not advice as provided in s. 14 of the\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service\n:\n\"14. The Service may\n(a) advise any minister of the Crown on matters relating to the security of Canada, or\n(b) provide any minister of the Crown with information relating to security matters or criminal activities, that is relevant to the exercise of any power or the performance of any duty or function by that Minister under the Citizenship Act or the Immigration Act.\"\n[31]\nIn my opinion, it is apparent on a balance of probabilities that CSIS has usurped the decision-making powers conferred on the registrar and the citizenship judge. Furthermore, I am of the view that the applicant has satisfied the requirements that must be met in order for a writ of mandamus to be issued.\n(1) there is a public legal duty to the applicant, which rests on the registrar and the citizenship judge, to determine and process the application in accordance with the\nAct\nand the\nRegulations\n;\n(2) first, the applicant's application satisfies the\nAct\nand the\nRegulations\nto the extent possible, and second, the time taken by CSIS is unreasonable and amounts to an implied refusal;\n(3) in the instant case, the applicant has no other remedy.\nConclusion\n[32]\nThis application for judicial review is allowed.\n[33]\nThe registrar shall inform CSIS that unless justification for continuing the investigation is provided as soon as the registrar shall consider appropriate, the investigation will be considered to be closed.\n[34]\nIf there are serious reasons to justify continuing the investigation, the registrar shall then inform the applicant that the investigation is continuing and that processing of his application is suspended until the investigation is completed.\n[35]\nIf there are no serious reasons or a reply is not received, the registrar shall, on the assumption that the investigation is closed, forward the application to a citizenship judge for the citizenship judge to consider the application and decide it on the merits.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Angela E.

  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nTremblay-Lamer, J.\n[Translation]: The applicant, Jean Édouard Conille, has filed an application for judicial review under s. 18 of the\nFederal Court Act\n[see footnote 1] seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the \"Minister\") to process the application for citizenship he filed on August 7, 1995, under the\nCitizenship Act\n[see footnote 2] (the \"\nAct\n\").\nFacts\n\n[2]\nThe applicant comes from Haiti, and was born in 1967. He arrived in Canada in 1973 as a permanent resident. On November 18, 1991, he made his first application for citizenship, which was refused on June 15, 1995 by the citizenship judge Elizabeth Wilcock. The applicant did not meet the residence requirement set out in s. 5(1) of the\nAct\nin that he had been under a probation order for a period of three years ending on August 3, 1991, and in accordance with s. 21 of the\nAct\nthat period could not be taken into account in calculating the length of residence in Canada. The period of probation had been imposed on the applicant after he was convicted of causing death by criminal negligence, on August 3, 1988, contrary to ss. 202 and 203 of the\nCriminal Code\n. [see footnote 3]\n\n[3]\nOn August 7, 1995, the applicant made a new application for citizenship which has not yet received a response. Accordingly, the purpose of this application for judicial review is to obtain an order directing the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to process the application for citizenship.\nThe Parties' Arguments\n\n[4]\nThe applicant contends, first, that the three-year delay since the application for citizenship was made on August 7, 1995, is unreasonable. In his view, the investigation concerning him, which is cited as justification for the delay in processing his case, should have started in December 1994, although the application in question here was filed in August 1995. Under the regulatory procedure, requests for investigations are submitted when the application for citizenship is filed, and do not take three years to be completed. This delay does not comply with the provisions of the\nAct\n, which requires, in mandatory language, that applications be processed promptly and transparently.\n\n[5]\nIn addition, the applicant alleges that the processing of complaints is not legally subject to the authorization of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (\"CSIS\") and accordingly that the powers conferred on the registrar and the citizenship judge have been usurped. The respondent, on the other hand, asserts that the applicant's citizenship application cannot be examined as long as CSIS has not given its authorization. In the applicant's view, this amounts to an unauthorized and illegal delegation of power, since CSIS has no statutory power to authorize or not authorize a citizenship application. Sections 14 and 15 of the\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service Act\n[see footnote 4] only gives CSIS powers to advise the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.\n\n[6]\nWith respect to the delegation of power, the respondent contends that CSIS is involved only as an adviser, supplying the results of its investigation. As set out in the record, the decision-making power is not exercised by CSIS.\nIssue\n\n[7]\nIs issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to process the applicant's citizenship application justified having regard to the allegations of unreasonable delay and usurpation of powers by CSIS?\nAnalysis\n\n[8]\nWe need only briefly recall that issuance of a writ of mandamus is subject to the following conditions precedent:\n(1) there is a public legal duty to the applicant to act;\n(2) the duty must be owed to the applicant;\n(3) there is a clear right to the performance of that duty, in particular:\n(a) the applicant has satisfied all conditions precedent giving rise to the duty;\n(b) there was a prior demand for performance of the duty, a reasonable time to comply with the demand, and a subsequent refusal which can be either expressed or implied, e.g. unreasonable delay; and\n(4) there is no other adequate remedy. [see footnote 5]\n\n[9]\nProcessing of citizenship applications is governed by the\nAct\nand the\nCitizenship Regulations\n[see footnote 6], 1993 (the \"\nRegulations\n\"). In accordance with s. 5(1) of the\nAct\n, the Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who meets the requirements. Section 5(1) reads as follows:\n\"5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n(a) makes application for citizenship;\n(b) is eighteen years of age or over;\n(c) has been lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence, has not ceased since such admission to be a permanent resident pursuant to section 24 of the Immigration Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;\n(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;\n(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; and\n(f) is not under a deportation order and is not the subject of a declaration by the Governor-in-Council made pursuant to section 20.\"\n\n[10]\nSection 11 of the\nRegulations\nprovides that when a citizenship application is filed the registrar is responsible for causing the inquiries necessary for the application of the\nAct\nto be commenced.

While I would not presume to fix any uniform length of time as being the limit on what is reasonable, I am satisfied on the basis of the limited information which I have before me that a delay of 4 1/2 years from the time the renewed application was made is unreasonable and on its face amounts to a failure to make a decision.\" [see footnote 13]\n\n[25]\nWhen, as it is in this case, an investigation drags on beyond the normal time for this kind of investigation, it is my opinion that the registrar may inform the investigator that he will consider the investigation to be concluded, unless he is informed, as soon as he considers appropriate, that there are serious reasons to justify continuing it. Unless CSIS indicates otherwise as to the importance of confidentiality, procedural fairness demands that the registrar inform the applicant that an investigation is ongoing, delaying a decision on his citizenship application. In most cases, I do not believe that this kind of requirement could jeopardize the result of the investigation since, as in the instant case and in\nLee,\n[see footnote 14] the applicant is in any event aware that there is an investigation, having brought an application for mandamus in the Federal Court. The applicant would then have an opportunity to initiate other proceedings before the body in question, inter alia through the complaint procedure set out in s. 41 et seq. of the\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service Act\n, [see footnote 15] which provides:\n\"41(1) Any person may make a complaint to the Review Committee with respect to any act or thing done by the Service and the Committee shall, subject to subsection (2), investigate the complaint if,\n(a) the complainant has made a complaint to the Director with respect to that act or thing and the complainant has not received a response within such a period of time as the Committee considers reasonable or is dissatisfied with the response given; and\n(b) the Committee is satisfied that the complaint is not trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith.\"\n\n[26]\nTo allow CSIS to delay the conclusion of its investigation indefinitely, and thereby prevent the registrar from submitting the application to the citizenship judge, amounts, in my view, to usurping the powers conferred on the registrar and the citizenship judge by the\nAct\n.\n\n[27]\nIt is furthermore not surprising that the affidavit of the respondent's representative, Mr. Payette, refers to the practice of waiting for CSIS\nauthorization\nin processing complaints. On this point, he says in his affidavit: [see footnote 16]\n[TRANSLATION] \"12. I have been informed by representatives of CSIS that the applicant's case is still being examined. To date, CSIS has never given its authorization in respect of the citizenship application filed by the applicant on August 7, 1995.\n\"13. The applicant's citizenship application cannot be examined as long as CSIS has not given its authorization for that to be done.\"\n\n[28]\nIn addition, the memoranda in the file reiterate that the application is suspended as long as \"the clearance has not been finalized\". [see footnote 17]\n\n[29]\nThe respondent referred to Mr. Payette's cross-examination [see footnote 18] in which he stated that what he meant was checks. He also referred to a memorandum in the file dated December 7, 1995, in which Mr. Payette, on behalf of Mr. Sabourin, told CSIS that processing of the case would be suspended while awaiting advice from CSIS. [see footnote 19]\n\n[30]\nHowever, having carefully reread the transcript, it appears that Mr. Payette stated several times that he was talking about CSIS giving authorization, and not advice as provided in s. 14 of the\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service\n:\n\"14. The Service may\n(a) advise any minister of the Crown on matters relating to the security of Canada, or\n(b) provide any minister of the Crown with information relating to security matters or criminal activities, that is relevant to the exercise of any power or the performance of any duty or function by that Minister under the Citizenship Act or the Immigration Act.\"\n\n[31]\nIn my opinion, it is apparent on a balance of probabilities that CSIS has usurped the decision-making powers conferred on the registrar and the citizenship judge. Furthermore, I am of the view that the applicant has satisfied the requirements that must be met in order for a writ of mandamus to be issued.\n(1) there is a public legal duty to the applicant, which rests on the registrar and the citizenship judge, to determine and process the application in accordance with the\nAct\nand the\nRegulations\n;\n(2) first, the applicant's application satisfies the\nAct\nand the\nRegulations\nto the extent possible, and second, the time taken by CSIS is unreasonable and amounts to an implied refusal;\n(3) in the instant case, the applicant has no other remedy.\nConclusion\n\n[32]\nThis application for judicial review is allowed.\n\n[33]\nThe registrar shall inform CSIS that unless justification for continuing the investigation is provided as soon as the registrar shall consider appropriate, the investigation will be considered to be closed.\n\n[34]\nIf there are serious reasons to justify continuing the investigation, the registrar shall then inform the applicant that the investigation is continuing and that processing of his application is suspended until the investigation is completed.\n\n[35]\nIf there are no serious reasons or a reply is not received, the registrar shall, on the assumption that the investigation is closed, forward the application to a citizenship judge for the citizenship judge to consider the application and decide it on the merits.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Angela E.
