Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2009] F.T.R. TBEd. FE.003.\nI.\nAu préalable",
    "[1]\nJustice Shore\n: Evidence is not a toy to be manipulated in any way. Its meaning should be clear, clear and precise and unambiguous. The weakness within a proof is revealed when examined from all sides. Like a transparent crystal, its light, like its shadow, is demonstrated with time, devoted to observation. So the proof, in itself, should not become over time what it was not originally, a toy to be manipulated in one direction or another, dependent on the speaker ultimately demonstrating nonsense.",
    "[2] [9] I do not find that the officer erred in her assessment of the applicant's education. The applicant provided student transcripts from the Yorkdale Adult Learning Centre attesting to the accounting courses she had taken. However, none of these documents indicate that the applicant was awarded a credential for her studies. Thus, I find that the officer reasonably evaluated the evidence presented and awarded the applicant a sufficient number of points for her education.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 166).\nII.\nJudicial proceeding",
    "[3]\nThis is an application for judicial review of the decision dated January 17, 2008, by a visa officer of the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, rejecting the applicant's application for permanent residence under the skilled workers class. The visa officer rejected the application on the basis that the applicant failed to obtain the 67 points required for the issuance of a visa under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 (Regulations).\nIII.\nFacts",
    "[4]\nThe applicant, Barar Hanif, is a political science specialist in Pakistan. He is married to Samina Choudhry, and they have two children. On January 10, 2002, he applied to the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, for permanent residency under the skilled workers class.",
    "[5]\nThe (federal) skilled worker class is evaluated on the basis of the minimal requirements set out in subsection 75(2) and the criteria set out in subsection 76(1) of the Regulations. The criteria refer to the following factors: age, education, language proficiency, experience, arranged employment and adaptability. A maximum of 25 points may be awarded for education, and subsection 78(2) of the Regulations indicates the number of points that may be awarded for specific \"educational credentials\".",
    "[6]\nThe applicant's application for permanent residence was refused in a letter dated January 17, 2008. That decision is the subject of this application.\nIV.\nDecision under review",
    "[7]\nThe visa officer made the following evaluation under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA):\n-\nPoints awarded\nMaximum\nAge\n10\n10\nEducation\n05\n25\nExperience\n21\n21\nArranged employment\n00\n10\nProficiency in the official languages of Canada:\n-\n-\nEnglish\n-\n-\nFrench\n05\n24\nAdaptability: Educational credentials of the skilled worker's accompanying spouse or accompanying common-law partner\n-\n-\nPrevious study in Canada\n-\n-\nArranged employment\n-\n-\nClose relatives in Canada\n05\n10\nTotal\n46\n100",
    "[8]\nAs Mr. Hanif obtained a total of only 46 points, whereas the minimum number required is 67, the visa officer refused the application for permanent residence because she was not satisfied that he would be able to become economically established in Canada.",
    "[9]\nMr. Hanif provided evidence that he had obtained four post-secondary educational credentials, namely, a Bachelor of Arts from the University of the Punjab, a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Karachi, a Master of Arts in political science from the University of the Punjab and a Master of Arts in Punjabi from the University of the Punjab. The visa officer awarded him only 5 points out of 25 points for education. In her refusal letter, she explained that Mr. Hanif's post-secondary studies do not meet the requirements of subsection 78(1) of the Regulations because he is considered to be an external or private candidate.\nV.\nIssues",
    "[10]\n(1) Did the visa officer err in determining that she could not consider the applicant's post-secondary credentials because he had completed his studies as an external student?\n(2) Did the visa officer err in failing to consider, in her decision, the education of the applicant's spouse?\n(3) Did the visa officer base her decision on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a capricious manner, without regard for the material and evidence before her?\nVI.\nAnalysis\nStandard of review",
    "[11]\nThe visa officer had to determine whether Mr. Hanif met the statutory requirements for obtaining points for his studies: \"... the Visa Officer was primarily engaged in factual determinations. Determinations of fact by a specialized decision-maker attract deference\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 516 at paragraph 22).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 145 at paragraphs 10-15, Justice Elizabeth Heneghan concluded, following a pragmatic and functional analysis, that the applicable standard of review is patent unreasonableness. Therefore, before\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] 1 S. C. R. 190, the appropriate standard of review to apply in the context of a visa officer's discretionary decision was patent unreasonableness (also: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 22-25;\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 282 at paragraph 15).",
    "[12] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 57 and 62, states that, if a standard of review has already been determined, the four factors of the former pragmatic and functional analysis should not be applied. In this case, since the visa officer's decision is one based on an analysis of the facts, the standard of review is reasonableness.\nLegislation",
    "[13]\nSubsection 12(2) of the IRPA governs the selection of permanent residents based on economic reasons:\nEconomic immigration\n12\n. (2) A foreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.\nImmigration économique\n12.\n(2) La sélection des étrangers de la catégorie  immigration économique  se fait en fonction de leur capacité à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada.",
    "[14]\nSections 73 to 85 of the Regulations govern the evaluation of applications for permanent residence in the (federal) skilled worker class. The relevant provisions of the Regulations are those relating to the evaluation of studies.",
    "[15]\nThe definition of the diploma in the Regulations is as follows:\n73\n. The following definitions apply to this section.\n diploma Any diploma, certificate of competence or certificate of apprenticeship obtained following the successful completion of a program of study or a training course offered by an educational or training establishment recognized by the authorities responsible for registering, accrediting, supervising and regulating educational establishments in the country of issue of this diploma or certificate. (\neducational credential\n)\n73.\nThe definitions in this section apply in this Division.\n\"educational credential\" means any diploma, degree or trade or apprenticeship credential issued on the completion of a program of study or training at an educational or training institution recognized by the authorities responsible for registering, accrediting, supervising and regulating such institutions in the country of issue. (\ndiploma\n)",
    "[16]\nThe definition of full-time and full-time equivalent are as follows:\n78\n. (1) The following definitions apply in this section.\n full-time equivalent In relation to such number of years of full-time studies, the number of years of part-time studies or accelerated studies that would have been necessary to complete equivalent studies. (\nfull-time equivalent\n)\n full-time With regard to a program of study which leads to the obtaining of a diploma, corresponds to fifteen hours of classes per week during the school year, and includes any period of training given in the workplace and forming part of the program (\nfull-time\n).\n78.\n(1) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section.\n\"full-time\" means, in relation to a program of study leading to an educational credential, at least 15 hours of instruction per week during the academic year, including any period of training in the workplace that forms part of the course of instruction. (\nfull time\n)\n\"full-time equivalent\" means, in respect of part-time or accelerated studies, the period that would have been required to complete those studies on a full-time basis. (\nfull-time equivalent\n) .",
    "[17]\nThe selection criteria for studies are in subsection 78(2) of the Regulations:\n78.\n(2) A maximum of 25 assessment points are awarded for the qualified worker's studies according to the following grid:\na) 5 points, if he has obtained a secondary school diploma;\nb) 12 points, if he obtained a post-secondary diploma - other than a university diploma - requiring one year of study and has accumulated a total of at least twelve years of complete full-time studies or the full-time equivalent;\nc) 15 points, if, as applicable:\n(i) he has obtained a post-secondary diploma - other than a university diploma - requiring one year of study and has accumulated a total of thirteen years of complete full-time study or the full-time equivalent,\n(ii) he has obtained an undergraduate university degree requiring one year of study and has accumulated a total of at least thirteen full years of full-time study or the full-time equivalent;\nd) 20 points, if, as the case may be:\n(i) he has obtained a post-secondary diploma - other than a university diploma - requiring two years of study and has accumulated a total of fourteen years of complete full-time study or the full-time equivalent,\n(ii) he has obtained an undergraduate university degree requiring two years of study and has accumulated a total of at least fourteen years of complete full-time study or the full-time equivalent;\ne) 22 points, if, as applicable:\n(i) he has obtained a post-secondary diploma - other than a university diploma - requiring three years of full-time study and has accumulated a total of fifteen years of complete full-time study or the full-time equivalent,\n(ii) he has obtained at least two undergraduate university degrees and has accumulated a total of at least fifteen years of complete full-time study or the full-time equivalent;\nf\n) 25 points, if he has obtained a second or third cycle university degree and has accumulated a total of at least seventeen years of complete full-time studies or the full-time equivalent.\n78.\n(2) A maximum of 25 points shall be awarded for a skilled worker's education as follows:\n(\nhas\n) 5 points for a secondary school educational credential;\n(\nb\n) 12 points for a one-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 12 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies;\n(\nc\n) 15 points for\n(i) a one-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 13 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies, or\n(ii) a one-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 13 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies;\n(\nd\n) 20 points for\n(i) a two-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies, or\n(ii) a two-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies;\n(\ne\n) 22 points for\n(i) a three-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 15 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies, or\n(ii) two or more university educational credentials at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 15 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies; and\n(\nf\n) 25 points for a university educational credential at the master's or doctoral level and a total of at least 17 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies.",
    "[18]\nThe selection criteria for adaptability related to the education credentials of the applicant's accompanying spouse or accompanying common-law partner are found at subsections 83(1) and (2) of the Regulations:\nAdaptability (10 points)\n83.\n(1) A maximum of 10 points for adaptability shall be awarded to a skilled worker on the basis of any combination of the following elements:\n(\na\n) for the educational credentials of the skilled worker's accompanying spouse or accompanying common-law partner, 3, 4 or 5 points determined in accordance with subsection (2);\n. . . . .\n(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(\na\n), an officer shall evaluate the educational credentials of a skilled worker's accompanying spouse or accompanying common-law partner as if the spouse or common-law partner were a skilled worker, and shall award points to the skilled worker as follows:\n(\na\n) for a spouse or common-law partner who would be awarded 25 points, 5 points;\n(\nb\n) for a spouse or common-law partner who would be awarded 20 or 22 points, 4 points; and\n(\nc\n) for a spouse or common-law partner who would be awarded 12 or 15 points, 3 points.\nCapacité d'adaptation (10 points)\n83.\n(1) Un maximum de 10 points d'appréciation sont attribués au travailleur qualifié au titre de la capacité d'adaptation pour toute combinaison des éléments ci-après, selon le nombre indiqué:\na) pour les diplômes de l'époux ou du conjoint de fait, 3, 4 ou 5 points conformément au paragraphe (2);\n[. . . . .]\n(2) Pour l'application de l'alinéa (1)\na\n), l'agente évalue les diplômes de l'époux ou du conjoint de fait qui accompagne le travailleur qualifié comme s'il s'agissait du travailleur qualifié et lui attribue des points selon la grille suivante:\na) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 25 points, 5 points;\nb) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 20 ou 22 points, 4 points;\nc) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 12 ou 15 points, 3 points.\n(1)\nDid the visa officer err in determining that she could not consider the applicant's post-secondary credentials because he had completed his studies as an external student\n?",
    "[19]\nFirst, it should be mentioned that, even if Mr. Hanif were to be awarded 20 additional points for his studies, he would have a total of only 66 points, which falls short of the 67 points required; therefore, to attain the points required, Mr. Hanif must also obtain points for the second question regarding the eligibility of his spouse's studies. Otherwise, subsection 76(3) of the Regulations grants the visa officer the discretion to substitute for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(\na\n) his or her evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada. This Court does not have to rule on that last question.",
    "[20]\nMr. Hanif provided evidence that he had obtained his degrees from the University of the Punjab. The following is the list of Mr. Hanif's studies:\n- Primary and secondary school diplomas;\n- Bachelor of Arts conferred by the University of the Punjab;\n- Bachelor of Laws conferred by the University of Karachi;\n- Master of Arts in political science conferred by the University of the Punjab;\n- Master of Arts in Punjabi conferred by the University of the Punjab.\nMr. Hanif claims that he completed 10 years of primary and secondary schooling and 11 years of post-secondary studies, totalling more than 20 years of formal training.",
    "[21]\nMr. Hanif claims that, according to paragraph 78(2)(\nf\n) of the Regulations, he should have been awarded 25 points because he had a university educational credential at the master's or doctoral level and a total of at least 17 years of full-time studies.",
    "[22]\nHowever, the Minister claims that the evidence showed that Mr. Hanif was an external or private student. Notes in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) indicate that the visa officer determined that the diplomas submitted seemed to be legitimate (Record at page 156). She also wrote in the CAIPS:\nEDUCATION: FN'S POST SECONDARY EDUCATION FROM U OF PUNJAB TAKEN AS A PRIVATE STUDENT PER TRANSCRIPTS. THESE DEGREES ARE OBTAINED AFTER PASSING THE REQUIRED EXAMS WITHOUT ATTENDING CLASS. THEREFORE, DOES NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF FULL TIME STUDENT AS SET OUT IN R78(1). POINTS AWARDED FOR EDUCATION WHERE FN WAS A FULL TIME STUDENT.\n(05 POINTS)\n(Record at page 156).",
    "[23]\nDans son affidavit, l'agente des visas a élaboré ses raisons pour déterminer que monsieur Hanif a obtenu ses diplômes comme candidat externe:\n9. First, the introductory statement of both degrees reads: \"of the Sheikhupura district\". This means that the Applicant approached the University of Punjab as a resident of the Sheikhupura district and applied to write the final exam for each degree at the University of Punjab.\n10. Second, both degrees contain a \"z\" in the registration number. If a person is in full-time attendance at the University of Punjab, the registration number contains the initials of the college or high school that the person applied from, instead of the letter \"z\".\n(Affidavit de Janice Molsberry.)\nComme étudiant externe ou privé, l'agente des visas a déterminé que les faits démontrent que monsieur Hanif n'a jamais suivi des cours à l'Université de Punjab. Par conséquent, monsieur Hanif n'était pas un étudiant régulier à temps plein comme requis par le paragraphe 78(1) et l'alinéa 78(2)\nd\n) du Règlement.",
    "[24]\nThe definition of educational credential at section 73 of the Regulations does not indicate whether the applicant must have obtained the credential as an internal or external candidate. However, paragraph 78(2)(\nf\n) of the Regulations requires that the skilled worker must have obtained a university educational credential at the master's or doctoral level and a total of at least 17 years of full-time studies. The two statements in this paragraph are separated by \"and\", but it is not clear whether a university educational credential must have been obtained at the institution where the full-time studies were done. Consequently, the provision allows for the possibility of studying full time in one university while receiving a university degree from another.",
    "[25]\nThe recent decision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, rules on the same provisions with similar facts. Justice Orville Frenette found that the University of the Punjab was not an \"attending\" institution for undergraduate students: [38]\n... Rather, [the University of the Punjab] administered exams for those who have attended other institutions and conferred degrees accordingly. However, this did not mean that the Applicant did not receive a two-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level nor did it mean that he did not complete a total of fourteen years of schooling . ...",
    "[26]\nMoreover, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court found that the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan confirmed that Mr. Hameed's Bachelor of Arts degree conferred by the University of the Punjab was recognized as the equivalent to a corresponding bachelor's degree involving 14 years of schooling as awarded by other chartered universities/institutions ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 44). Even though this practice does not correspond exactly with Canadian standards, the guidelines do not call for comparisons to the Canadian educational system: \"Officers should assess programs of study and award points based on the standards that exist in the country of study\" (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Overseas Processing, OP6 Federal Skilled Workers Manual at section 10.2).",
    "[27]\nThe visa officer's determination that Mr. Hameed's degree was taken as a private student was completely irrelevant to the determination required to be made by subsection 78(2) of the Regulations: [45] [The provisions at subsection 78(2) of the Regulations require] only that the applicant demonstrate that he has a two-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time equivalent studies.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).",
    "[28]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Frenette ultimately found that the standards in Pakistan for granting a university bachelor's degree were met, regardless of whether the applicant attended the University of the Punjab as a private candidate or otherwise ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 48).",
    "[29]\nThe major difference between <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and this case is that Mr. Hameed submitted evidence confirming that he was a university-registered student in a Bachelor of Arts studies program recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.",
    "[30]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer was not satisfied that the applicant met the conditions set out in subsection 78(2) of the Regulations, as the applicant had not submitted any documents indicating that she had been awarded a credential for her studies: [8] The officer acknowledged that the applicant had taken an adult education course in accounting while living in Canada. However, given the applicant's failure to establish that the course was a course described in subsection 78(2) of the Regulations, the officer did not find that the accounting course justified the award of additional points. [9] I do not find that the officer erred in her assessment of the applicant's education. The applicant provided student transcripts from the Yorkdale Adult Learning Centre attesting to the accounting courses she had taken. However, none of these documents indicate that the applicant was awarded a credential for her studies. Thus, I find that the officer reasonably evaluated the evidence presented and awarded the applicant a sufficient number of points for her education.",
    "[31]\nIt is trite law that only information that was before the administrative tribunal can be considered by a reviewing court on judicial review. In this case, Mr. Hanif submitted no attendance record or transcript indicating that he was a full-time student. Therefore, to succeed, Mr. Hanif would require confirmation from the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan that the Bachelor of Arts conferred to Mr. Hanif by the University of the Punjab was recognized as the equivalent to a corresponding bachelor's degree as awarded by other chartered universities/institutions.\nIn other words, Mr. Hanif would need to provide an attendance record or a transcript indicating that he was a full-time student at another accredited university\n.",
    "[32]\nSince Mr. Hanif has not provided this type of evidence, the Court finds that the visa officer did not err in determining that she could not consider the applicant's post-secondary educational credentials.\n(2)\nDid the visa officer err in failing to consider, in her decision, the education of the applicant's spouse\n?",
    "[33]\nIn the CAIPS notes, the visa officer writes:\nFN IS MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN. SPOUSE AND CHILDREN ARE NOT ACCOMPANYING.\n. . . . .\nSPOUSE HOLDS BACHELORS DEGREE BUT NOT ACCOMPANYING AND NO FEES PAID. HOWEVER, SPOUSE WAS EXTERNAL STUDENT SO EVEN IF FEES PAID, NO POINTS WOULD BE AWARDED.\n(Record at pages 155-156).",
    "[34]\nIn the visa officer's affidavit, she states that Mr. Hanif's spouse was added as the worker's accompanying spouse. Therefore, the education of Mr. Hanif's spouse was considered. Mr. Hanif received no points because his wife's studies were not considered, since she was an external or private candidate. In following the above-mentioned analysis, the visa officer did not err in determining that she could not consider the post-secondary educational credentials of Mr. Hanif's spouse. There is no evidence in the record that Mr. Hanif's spouse was a full-time student at another accredited university.\n(3)\nDid the visa officer base her decision on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a capricious manner, without regard for the material and evidence before her\n?",
    "[35]\nWithin its jurisdiction, the Court has the discretion to quash the visa officer's decision if it was based on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before her (paragraph 18.1(4)(\nd\n) of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7).",
    "[36]\nThe visa officer made a number of findings regarding Mr. Hanif's post-secondary educational credentials, but the Court cannot disturb these findings absent unreasonableness. The CAIPS notes and the visa officer's affidavit provided a detailed explanation for her findings of fact relating to the documents submitted as proof of education. In this case, there is no unreasonable error.\nVII.\nConclusion",
    "[37]\nFor all these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[38]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée;\n2. Aucune question grave de portée générale ne soit certifiée.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is not a toy to be manipulated any which way. Its meaning should be clear, precise and unambiguous. Examining a piece of evidence from all angles reveals its inner weakness. Like a transparent crystal, it will cast light, as well as shadows, when observed over time. Therefore, with the passage of time, evidence in and of itself should not turn into something it never was to begin with; it should not be a toy to be manipulated one way or another, depending on the parties involved, to become, ultimately, meaningless."

La faiblesse, à l'intérieure d'une preuve, se dévoile une fois examinée de tous côtés. Comme un cristal transparent, sa lumière, comme son ombre se démontre avec le temps, consacré à l'observation. Donc la preuve, en elle-même, ne devrait pas devenir avec le temps ce qu'elle n'était pas à son origine, un jouet à manipuler dans un sens ou un autre, dépendant d'intervenant démontrant en fin, qu'un non-sens.\n[2]\n[9] Je ne conclus pas que l'agente a commis une erreur dans son appréciation des études de la demanderesse. La demanderesse a présenté des relevés de notes provenant du Yorkdale Adult Learning Centre attestant qu'elle avait suivi des cours de comptabilité. Toutefois, aucun de ces documents n'indique que la demanderesse avait reçu un titre de compétences pour ses études. Par conséquent, je conclus que l'agente a évalué d'une manière raisonnable les éléments de preuve qui ont été présentés et a accordé à la demanderesse un nombre de points suffisant pour ses études.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 166).\nII.\nProcédure judiciaire\n[3]\nLa présente est une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision d'une agente des visas du Haut-commissariat du Canada à Islamabad au Pakistan, rendue le 17 janvier 2008, rejetant la demande de résidence permanente dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés du demandeur. L'agente des visas a rejeté la demande au motif que le demandeur n'a pas obtenu les 67 points nécessaires à l'octroi d'un visa selon le\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/2002-227 (Règlement).\nIII.\nFaits\n[4]\nLe demandeur, monsieur Barar Hanif, est spécialiste en sciences politiques au Pakistan. Il est marié à madame Samina Choudhry et ils ont deux enfants. Le 10 janvier 2002, il a présenté une demande de résidence permanente dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés auprès du Haut-commissariat du Canada à Islamabad au Pakistan.\n[5]\nLa catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) est évaluée sur la base des exigences minimales prévues au paragraphe 75(2) et des critères prévus au paragraphe 76(1) du Règlement. Les critères visent les facteurs suivants: l'âge, les études, les compétences linguistiques, l'expérience, l'exercice d'un emploi réservé et la capacité d'adaptation. Le facteur des études permet d'obtenir un maximum de 25 points et le paragraphe 78(2) du Règlement énonce le nombre de points susceptibles d'être attribués pour des  diplômes  particuliers.\n[6]\nDans une lettre, datée du 17 janvier 2008, le demandeur s'est vu refuser la demande de résidence permanente. Cette décision fait l'objet de la présente demande.\nIV.\nLa décision faisant l'objet de la demande de contrôle judiciaire\n[7]\nL'agente des visas a fait l'évaluation suivante sous le régime de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (LIPR):\n-\nPoints attribués\nMaximum\nÂge\n10\n10\nÉtudes\n05\n25\nExpérience\n21\n21\nEmploi réservé\n00\n10\nCompétence dans les langues officielles du Canada:\n-\n-\n--Anglais\n-\n-\n--Français\n05\n24\nCapacité d'adaptation:\n-\n-\n--Diplôme de l'époux, épouse ou conjoint de fait qui l'accompagne\n-\n-\n--Études antérieures au Canada\n-\n-\n--Emploi réservé\n-\n-\n--Proches parents au Canada\n05\n10\nTotal\n46\n100\n[8]\nComme monsieur Hanif n'avait obtenu que 46 points au total, alors que le nombre minimum requis est de 67, l'agente des visas a refusé la demande de résidence permanente puisqu'elle n'était pas convaincue qu'il serait en mesure de réussir son établissement économique au Canada.\n[9]\nMonsieur Hanif a fourni des éléments de preuve tendant à démontrer qu'il avait obtenu quatre diplômes postsecondaires, soit un baccalauréat en art de l'Université de Punjab, un baccalauréat en droit de l'Université de Karachi, une maîtrise en art et science politique de l'Université de Punjab, et une maîtrise en art en Punjabi de l'Université de Punjab. L'agente des visas a donné seulement 5 points sur 25 points pour la catégorie des études. Dans sa lettre de refus, elle a expliqué que les études postsecondaires de monsieur Hanif ne satisfont pas aux exigences du paragraphe 78(1) du Règlement parce qu'il est considéré comme candidat externe ou privé.\nV.\nQuestions en litige\n[10]\n(1) L'agente des visas a-t-elle commis une erreur en déterminant qu'elle ne pouvait pas tenir compte des diplômes postsecondaires du demandeur parce qu'il avait terminé ses études en tant qu'étudiant externe?\n(2) L'agente des visas a-t-elle erré en ne tenant pas compte, dans sa décision, de l'éducation de l'épouse du demandeur?\n(3) L'agente des visas a-t-elle rendu une décision fondée sur une conclusion de faits erronés, tirée de façon arbitraire et sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle disposait et de la preuve présentée devant elle?\nVI.\nAnalyse\nLa norme de contrôle\n[11]\nL'agente des visas devait déterminer si monsieur Hanif remplissait les conditions prévues par la loi pour pouvoir obtenir des points d'appréciations pour ses études:  [...] l'agent des visas s'est surtout attardé en l'espèce à tirer des conclusions de fait. Les conclusions de fait tirées par un tribunal spécialisé commandent la retenue judiciaire  (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 516 au par. 22). À la suite d'une analyse pragmatique et fonctionnelle, la juge Elizabeth Heneghan a estimé dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la norme de contrôle applicable à une décision discrétionnaire d'une agente des visas était la norme de la décision manifestement déraisonnable (également: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus aux par. 22-25;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 282 au par. 15).\n[12] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 57 et 62, nous indique que s'il y a déjà une norme de contrôle établie, il n'y a pas lieu d'appliquer les quatre facteurs de l'ancienne analyse pragmatique et fonctionnelle. En l'espèce, puisque la décision de l'agente des visas est une décision basée sur l'analyse des faits, la norme de contrôle est celle de la décision raisonnable.\nLégislation\n[13]\nLe paragraphe 12(2) de la LIPR régit la sélection de résidence permanente fondée sur des motifs économiques:\nImmigration économique\n12.\n(2) La sélection des étrangers de la catégorie  immigration économique  se fait en fonction de leur capacité à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada.\nEconomic immigration\n12\n. (2) A foreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.\n[14]\nLes articles 73 à 85 du Règlement régissent l'évaluation des demandes de résidence permanente présentées dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). Les dispositions pertinentes du Règlement sont celles qui se rapportent à l'évaluation des études.\n[15]\nLa définition du diplôme dans le Règlement est le suivant:\n73\n. Les définitions qui suivent s'appliquent à la présente section.\n diplôme Tout diplôme, certificat de compétence ou certificat d'apprentissage obtenu conséquemment à la réussite d'un programme d'études ou d'un cours de formation offert par un établissement d'enseignement ou de formation reconnu par les autorités chargées d'enregistrer, d'accréditer, de superviser et de réglementer les établissements d'enseignement dans le pays de délivrance de ce diplôme ou certificat. (\neducational credential\n)\n73.\nThe definitions in this section apply in this Division.\n\"educational credential\" means any diploma, degree or trade or apprenticeship credential issued on the completion of a program of study or training at an educational or training institution recognized by the authorities responsible for registering, accrediting, supervising and regulating such institutions in the country of issue. (\ndiplôme\n)\n[16]\nLa définition de  temps plein  et  équivalent temps plein  sont les suivantes:\n78\n.

(\nfull-time equivalent\n)\n temps plein  À l'égard d'un programme d'études qui conduit à l'obtention d'un diplôme, correspond à quinze heures de cours par semaine pendant l'année scolaire, et comprend toute période de formation donnée en milieu de travail et faisant partie du programme (\nfull-time\n).\n78.\n(1) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section.\n\"full-time\" means, in relation to a program of study leading to an educational credential, at least 15 hours of instruction per week during the academic year, including any period of training in the workplace that forms part of the course of instruction. (\ntemps plein\n)\n\"full-time equivalent\" means, in respect of part-time or accelerated studies, the period that would have been required to complete those studies on a full-time basis. (\néquivalent temps plein\n) .\n[17]\nLes critères de sélection pour les études sont au paragraphe 78(2) du Règlement:\n78.\n(2) Un maximum de 25 points d'appréciation sont attribués pour les études du travailleur qualifié selon la grille suivante:\na) 5 points, s'il a obtenu un diplôme d'études secondaires;\nb) 12 points, s'il a obtenu un diplôme postsecondaire - autre qu'un diplôme universitaire - nécessitant une année d'études et a accumulé un total d'au moins douze années d'études à temps plein complètes ou l'équivalent temps plein;\nc) 15 points, si, selon le cas:\n(i) il a obtenu un diplôme postsecondaire - autre qu'un diplôme universitaire - nécessitant une année d'études et a accumulé un total de treize années d'études à temps plein complètes ou l'équivalent temps plein,\n(ii) il a obtenu un diplôme universitaire de premier cycle nécessitant une année d'études et a accumulé un total d'au moins treize années d'études à temps plein complètes ou l'équivalent temps plein;\nd) 20 points, si, selon le cas:\n(i) il a obtenu un diplôme postsecondaire - autre qu'un diplôme universitaire - nécessitant deux années d'études et a accumulé un total de quatorze années d'études à temps plein complètes ou l'équivalent temps plein,\n(ii) il a obtenu un diplôme universitaire de premier cycle nécessitant deux années d'études et a accumulé un total d'au moins quatorze années d'études à temps plein complètes ou l'équivalent temps plein;\ne) 22 points, si, selon le cas:\n(i) il a obtenu un diplôme postsecondaire - autre qu'un diplôme universitaire - nécessitant trois années d'études à temps plein et a accumulé un total de quinze années d'études à temps plein complètes ou l'équivalent temps plein,\n(ii) il a obtenu au moins deux diplômes universitaires de premier cycle et a accumulé un total d'au moins quinze années d'études à temps plein complètes ou l'équivalent temps plein;\nf\n) 25 points, s'il a obtenu un diplôme universitaire de deuxième ou de troisième cycle et a accumulé un total d'au moins dix-sept années d'études à temps plein complètes ou l'équivalent temps plein.\n78.\n(2) A maximum of 25 points shall be awarded for a skilled worker's education as follows:\n(\na\n) 5 points for a secondary school educational credential;\n(\nb\n) 12 points for a one-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 12 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies;\n(\nc\n) 15 points for\n(i) a one-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 13 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies, or\n(ii) a one-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 13 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies;\n(\nd\n) 20 points for\n(i) a two-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies, or\n(ii) a two-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies;\n(\ne\n) 22 points for\n(i) a three-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 15 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies, or\n(ii) two or more university educational credentials at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 15 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies; and\n(\nf\n) 25 points for a university educational credential at the master's or doctoral level and a total of at least 17 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies.\n[18]\nLes critères de sélection pour la capacité d'adaptation liée aux diplômes de l'époux, l'épouse ou le conjoint de fait qui accompagne le demandeur se trouvent aux paragraphes 83(1) et (2) du Règlement:\nCapacité d'adaptation (10 points)\n83.\n(1) Un maximum de 10 points d'appréciation sont attribués au travailleur qualifié au titre de la capacité d'adaptation pour toute combinaison des éléments ci-après, selon le nombre indiqué:\na) pour les diplômes de l'époux ou du conjoint de fait, 3, 4 ou 5 points conformément au paragraphe (2);\n[. . . . .]\n(2) Pour l'application de l'alinéa (1)\na\n), l'agente évalue les diplômes de l'époux ou du conjoint de fait qui accompagne le travailleur qualifié comme s'il s'agissait du travailleur qualifié et lui attribue des points selon la grille suivante:\na) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 25 points, 5 points;\nb) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 20 ou 22 points, 4 points;\nc) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 12 ou 15 points, 3 points.\nAdaptability (10 points)\n83.\n(1) A maximum of 10 points for adaptability shall be awarded to a skilled worker on the basis of any combination of the following elements:\n(\na\n) for the educational credentials of the skilled worker's accompanying spouse or accompanying common-law partner, 3, 4 or 5 points determined in accordance with subsection (2);\n. . . . .\n(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(\na\n), an officer shall evaluate the educational credentials of a skilled worker's accompanying spouse or accompanying common-law partner as if the spouse or common-law partner were a skilled worker, and shall award points to the skilled worker as follows:\n(\na\n) for a spouse or common-law partner who would be awarded 25 points, 5 points;\n(\nb\n) for a spouse or common-law partner who would be awarded 20 or 22 points, 4 points; and\n(\nc\n) for a spouse or common-law partner who would be awarded 12 or 15 points, 3 points.\n(1)\nL'agente des visas a-t-elle commis une erreur en déterminant qu'elle ne pouvait tenir compte des diplômes postsecondaires du demandeur parce qu'il avait terminé ses études en tant qu'étudiant externe?\n[19]\nPremièrement, il faut mentionner que même si monsieur Hanif se voit accorder 20 points additionnels pour ses études, il n'aura que 66 points en tout qui n'est pas suffisant pour obtenir les 67 points requis; donc, pour atteindre les points requis, monsieur Hanif doit aussi obtenir des points en ce qui concerne la deuxième question quant à l'admissibilité des études de son épouse. Autrement, le paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement donne à l'agente des visas la discrétion de substituer les critères de sélection pour son appréciation de l'aptitude du travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique au Canada. Cette Cour ne doit pas statuer sur cette dernière question.\n[20]\nMonsieur Hanif a fourni des éléments de preuve tendant à démontrer qu'il avait obtenu ses diplômes à l'Université de Punjab. Voici la liste des études poursuivies par monsieur Hanif:\n- Diplôme d'études primaires et secondaires;\n- Baccalauréat en art décerné par l'Université du Punjab;\n- Baccalauréat en droit décerné par l'Université de Karachi;\n- Maîtrise en arts en science politique décernée par l'Université de Punjab;\n- Maîtrise en arts en Punjabi décernée par l'Université de Punjab.\nMonsieur Hanif prétend qu'il a étudié pendant dix ans à l'école primaire et secondaire et onze ans d'études postsecondaires. En tout, il compte plus que vingt ans de formation officielle.\n[21]\nMonsieur Hanif prétend que selon l'alinéa 78(2)\nf\n) du Règlement, il aurait dû obtenir 25 points parce qu'il a obtenu un diplôme universitaire de deuxième ou de troisième cycle et a accumulé un total d'au moins dix-sept années d'études à temps plein.\n[22]\nPar contre, le Ministre prétend que la preuve démontrait que monsieur Hanif était un étudiant externe ou privé. Les notes du Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration (STIDI) montrent que l'agente des visas a établi que les diplômes soumis semblaient authentiques (Dossier à la p. 156). Elle a aussi écrit dans le STIDI:\nEDUCATION: FN'S POST SECONDARY EDUCATION FROM U OF PUNJAB TAKEN AS A PRIVATE STUDENT PER TRANSCRIPTS. THESE DEGREES ARE OBTAINED AFTER PASSING THE REQUIRED EXAMS WITHOUT ATTENDING CLASS. THEREFORE, DOES NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF FULL TIME STUDENT AS SET OUT IN R78(1). POINTS AWARDED FOR EDUCATION WHERE FN WAS A FULL TIME STUDENT.\n(05 POINTS)\n(Dossier à la p. 156.)\n[23]\nDans son affidavit, l'agente des visas a élaboré ses raisons pour déterminer que monsieur Hanif a obtenu ses diplômes comme candidat externe:\n9. First, the introductory statement of both degrees reads: \"of the Sheikhupura district\". This means that the Applicant approached the University of Punjab as a resident of the Sheikhupura district and applied to write the final exam for each degree at the University of Punjab.\n10. Second, both degrees contain a \"z\" in the registration number. If a person is in full-time attendance at the University of Punjab, the registration number contains the initials of the college or high school that the person applied from, instead of the letter \"z\".\n(Affidavit de Janice Molsberry.)\nComme étudiant externe ou privé, l'agente des visas a déterminé que les faits démontrent que monsieur Hanif n'a jamais suivi des cours à l'Université de Punjab. Par conséquent, monsieur Hanif n'était pas un étudiant régulier à temps plein comme requis par le paragraphe 78(1) et l'alinéa 78(2)\nd\n) du Règlement.\n[24]\nLa définition de diplôme à l'article 73 du Règlement n'indique pas si le diplôme doit être obtenu en tant que candidat interne ou externe. Cependant, l'alinéa 78(2)\nf\n) du Règlement exige que le travailleur qualifié ait obtenu un diplôme universitaire de deuxième ou de troisième cycle tout en ayant accumulé au moins 17 années d'études à temps plein. Les deux propositions dans cet alinéa sont séparées par  et  ; ce n'est toutefois pas clair s'il faut obtenir un diplôme universitaire où on a fait les études à temps plein. La disposition laisse par conséquent la possibilité d'étudier à temps plein dans une université tout en recevant un diplôme universitaire d'une autre université.\n[25]\nLa décision récente <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, tranche sur les mêmes dispositions avec des faits semblables. Le juge Orville Frenette a conclu que l'Université de Punjab n'est pas un établissement  fréquenté  par des étudiants du premier cycle:\n[38] [...] l'université du Pendjab [...] fait plutôt passer des examens à des étudiants qui ont fréquenté d'autres établissements d'enseignement et elle leur confère des diplômes en conséquence, ce qui ne veut cependant pas dire que le demandeur n'a pas obtenu un diplôme universitaire de premier cycle nécessitant deux années d'études ou qu'il n'a pas accumulé un total d'au moins quatorze années d'études...\n[26]\nEn outre, la Cour dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a constaté que la Commission des études supérieures du Pakistan a confirmé que le baccalauréat en arts conféré à monsieur Hameed par l'Université de Punjab a été reconnu comme l'équivalent du baccalauréat correspondant décerné par d'autres universités et établissements à charte au terme de quatorze années d'études ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au par. 44). Même si cette pratique ne correspond pas exactement aux normes canadiennes, les lignes directrices ne prévoient pas de comparaisons avec le système scolaire canadien:  L'évaluation des programmes d'études et l'attribution des points sont basées sur les normes existantes dans le pays où les études ont été faites  (Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada, Traitement des demandes à l'étranger, OP6 Guide des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) au par. 10.2).\n[27]\nLa conclusion de l'agente des visas suivant laquelle monsieur Hameed avait obtenu son diplôme en qualité d'étudiant privé n'avait rien à voir avec la conclusion qu'elle devait tirer aux termes du paragraphe 78(2) du Règlement:\n[45] [Les dispositions aux paragraphes 78(2) du Règlement exigent] seulement que le demandeur démontre qu'il a un diplôme universitaire de premier cycle nécessitant deux années d'études et qu'il a accumulé au total au moins quatorze années d'études à temps plein complètes équivalentes. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus.)\n[28]\nDans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Frenette a finalement conclu que les normes auxquelles il faut satisfaire au Pakistan pour pouvoir obtenir un baccalauréat universitaire ont été respectées et ce, peu importe que le demandeur ait fréquenté l'Université de Punjab en tant que candidat privé ou en une autre qualité ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au par. 48).\n[29]\nLa grande différence entre <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et le présent cas est que monsieur Hameed a soumis la preuve confirmant qu'il avait été inscrit dans une université et qu'il avait suivi un programme d'études menant à un baccalauréat en arts reconnu par la Commission des études supérieures du Pakistan.\n[30]\nDans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, la juge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur satisfaisait aux conditions prescrites au paragraphe 78(2) du Règlement puisque la demanderesse n'a pas soumis des documents indiquant qu'elle avait reçu un titre de compétence pour ses études:\n[8] L'agente a reconnu que la demanderesse avait suivi un cours d'éducation aux adultes en comptabilité alors qu'elle vivait au Canada. Toutefois, compte tenu que la demanderesse n'a pas démontré que le cours était l'un de ceux dont la description figure au paragraphe 78(2) des Règles, l'agente n'a pas conclu que le cours de comptabilité justifiait l'accord de points supplémentaires.\n[9] Je ne conclus pas que l'agente a commis une erreur dans son appréciation des études de la demanderesse. La demanderesse a présenté des relevés de notes provenant du Yorkdale Adult Learning Centre attestant qu'elle avait suivi des cours de comptabilité. Toutefois, aucun de ces documents n'indique que la demanderesse avait reçu un titre de compétences pour ses études. Par conséquent, je conclus que l'agente a évalué d'une manière raisonnable les éléments de preuve qui ont été présentés et a accordé à la demanderesse un nombre de points suffisant pour ses études.\n[31]\nIl est bien établi que seuls les renseignements qui ont été présentés au tribunal administratif peuvent être examinés par une cour de révision dans le cadre d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire. En l'espèce, monsieur Hanif n'a soumis aucun dossier de présence ni de relevé de notes pour indiquer qu'il était étudiant à temps plein. Donc, pour réussir, monsieur Hanif aurait besoin d'une confirmation par la Commission des études supérieures du Pakistan que le baccalauréat en arts conféré à monsieur Hanif par l'Université de Punjab a été reconnu comme l'équivalent du baccalauréat correspondant décerné par d'autres universités et établissements à charte.\nAutrement, monsieur Hanif aurait besoin de fournir un dossier de présence ou un relevé de notes pour indiquer qu'il était étudiant à temps plein chez une autre université accréditée\n.\n[32]\nPuisque monsieur Hanif n'a pas fourni ce type de preuve, la Cour conclut que l'agente des visas n'a pas commis une erreur en déterminant qu'elle ne pouvait pas tenir compte des diplômes postsecondaires du demandeur.\n(2)\nL'agente des visas a-t-elle erré en ne tenant pas compte, dans sa décision, de l'éducation de l'épouse du demandeur\n?\n[33]\nDans les notes du STIDI, l'agente des visas écrit:\nFN IS MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN. SPOUSE AND CHILDREN ARE NOT ACCOMPANYING.\n. . . . .\nSPOUSE HOLDS BACHELORS DEGREE BUT NOT ACCOMPANYING AND NO FEES PAID. HOWEVER, SPOUSE WAS EXTERNAL STUDENT SO EVEN IF FEES PAID, NO POINTS WOULD BE AWARDED.\n(Dossier aux pp. 155-156.)\n[34]\nDans l'affidavit de l'agente des visas, elle a indiqué que l'épouse de monsieur Hanif était ajoutée comme l'épouse qui accompagne le travailleur. Donc, l'éducation de l'épouse de monsieur Hanif a été considérée. Monsieur Hanif n'a pas reçu de points puisque les études de sa femme n'étaient pas considérées parce qu'elle était une candidate externe ou privée. En suivant l'analyse ci-dessus, l'agente des visas n'a pas commis d'erreur en déterminant qu'elle ne pouvait tenir compte des diplômes postsecondaires de l'épouse de monsieur Hanif. Il n'y a aucune preuve dans le dossier que l'épouse de monsieur Hanif était étudiante à temps plein dans une autre université accréditée.\n(3)\nL'agente des visas a-t-elle rendu une décision fondée sur une conclusion de faits erronés, tirée de façon arbitraire et sans tenir compte des éléments dont il disposait et de la preuve présentée devant elle\n?\n[35]\nÀ l'intérieur de sa juridiction, la Cour a la discrétion d'annuler la décision de l'agente des visas si elle l'a rendue fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle dispose (alinéa 18.1(4)\nd\n) de la\nLoi sur les Cours fédérales\n, L.R. (1985), ch. F-7.\n[36]\nL'agente des visas a tiré de nombreuses conclusions portant sur les diplômes postsecondaires de monsieur Hanif, mais la Cour ne peut modifier lesdites conclusions que si elles sont déraisonnables. Les notes du STIDI et son affidavit ont expliqué d'une manière détaillée ses conclusions de faits se rapportant aux documents soumis comme preuve d'éducation. En l'espèce, il n'a pas d'erreur déraisonnable.\nVII.\nConclusion\n[37]\nPour tous ces motifs, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\nJUGEMENT\n[38]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée;\n2. Aucune question grave de portée générale ne soit certifiée.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is not a toy to be manipulated any which way. Its meaning should be clear, precise and unambiguous. Examining a piece of evidence from all angles reveals its inner weakness. Like a transparent crystal, it will cast light, as well as shadows, when observed over time. Therefore, with the passage of time, evidence in and of itself should not turn into something it never was to begin with; it should not be a toy to be manipulated one way or another, depending on the parties involved, to become, ultimately, meaningless.\n[2]\n[9] I do not find that the officer erred in her assessment of the applicant's education. The applicant provided student transcripts from the Yorkdale Adult Learning Centre attesting to the accounting courses she had taken. However, none of these documents indicate that the applicant was awarded a credential for her studies. Thus, I find that the officer reasonably evaluated the evidence presented and awarded the applicant a sufficient number of points for her education.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 166).\nII.\nJudicial proceeding\n[3]\nThis is an application for judicial review of the decision dated January 17, 2008, by a visa officer of the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, rejecting the applicant's application for permanent residence under the skilled workers class. The visa officer rejected the application on the basis that the applicant failed to obtain the 67 points required for the issuance of a visa under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 (Regulations).\nIII.\nFacts\n[4]\nThe applicant, Barar Hanif, is a political science specialist in Pakistan. He is married to Samina Choudhry, and they have two children. On January 10, 2002, he applied to the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, for permanent residency under the skilled workers class.\n[5]\nThe (federal) skilled worker class is evaluated on the basis of the minimal requirements set out in subsection 75(2) and the criteria set out in subsection 76(1) of the Regulations. The criteria refer to the following factors: age, education, language proficiency, experience, arranged employment and adaptability. A maximum of 25 points may be awarded for education, and subsection 78(2) of the Regulations indicates the number of points that may be awarded for specific \"educational credentials\".\n[6]\nThe applicant's application for permanent residence was refused in a letter dated January 17, 2008. That decision is the subject of this application.\nIV.\nDecision under review\n[7]\nThe visa officer made the following evaluation under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA):\n-\nPoints awarded\nMaximum\nAge\n10\n10\nEducation\n05\n25\nExperience\n21\n21\nArranged employment\n00\n10\nProficiency in the official languages of Canada:\n-\n-\nEnglish\n-\n-\nFrench\n05\n24\nAdaptability: Educational credentials of the skilled worker's accompanying spouse or accompanying common-law partner\n-\n-\nPrevious study in Canada\n-\n-\nArranged employment\n-\n-\nClose relatives in Canada\n05\n10\nTotal\n46\n100\n[8]\nAs Mr. Hanif obtained a total of only 46 points, whereas the minimum number required is 67, the visa officer refused the application for permanent residence because she was not satisfied that he would be able to become economically established in Canada.\n[9]\nMr. Hanif provided evidence that he had obtained four post-secondary educational credentials, namely, a Bachelor of Arts from the University of the Punjab, a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Karachi, a Master of Arts in political science from the University of the Punjab and a Master of Arts in Punjabi from the University of the Punjab. The visa officer awarded him only 5 points out of 25 points for education. In her refusal letter, she explained that Mr. Hanif's post-secondary studies do not meet the requirements of subsection 78(1) of the Regulations because he is considered to be an external or private candidate.\nV.\nIssues\n[10]\n(1) Did the visa officer err in determining that she could not consider the applicant's post-secondary credentials because he had completed his studies as an external student?\n(2) Did the visa officer err in failing to consider, in her decision, the education of the applicant's spouse?\n(3) Did the visa officer base her decision on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a capricious manner, without regard for the material and evidence before her?\nVI.\nAnalysis\nStandard of review\n[11]\nThe visa officer had to determine whether Mr. Hanif met the statutory requirements for obtaining points for his studies: \"... the Visa Officer was primarily engaged in factual determinations. Determinations of fact by a specialized decision-maker attract deference\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 516 at paragraph 22).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 145 at paragraphs 10-15, Justice Elizabeth Heneghan concluded, following a pragmatic and functional analysis, that the applicable standard of review is patent unreasonableness. Therefore, before\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] 1 S. C. R. 190, the appropriate standard of review to apply in the context of a visa officer's discretionary decision was patent unreasonableness (also: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 22-25;\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 282 at paragraph 15).\n[12] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 57 and 62, states that, if a standard of review has already been determined, the four factors of the former pragmatic and functional analysis should not be applied. In this case, since the visa officer's decision is one based on an analysis of the facts, the standard of review is reasonableness.\nLegislation\n[13]\nSubsection 12(2) of the IRPA governs the selection of permanent residents based on economic reasons:\nEconomic immigration\n12\n. (2) A foreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.\nImmigration économique\n12.\n(2) La sélection des étrangers de la catégorie  immigration économique  se fait en fonction de leur capacité à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada.\n[14]\nSections 73 to 85 of the Regulations govern the evaluation of applications for permanent residence in the (federal) skilled worker class. The relevant provisions of the Regulations are those relating to the evaluation of studies.\n[15]\nThe definition of \"educational credential\" in the Regulations is as follows:\n73.\nThe definitions in this section apply in this Division.\n\"educational credential\" means any diploma, degree or trade or apprenticeship credential issued on the completion of a program of study or training at an educational or training institution recognized by the authorities responsible for registering, accrediting, supervising and regulating such institutions in the country of issue. (\ndiplôme\n)\n73\n.

and\n(\nc\n) for a spouse or common-law partner who would be awarded 12 or 15 points, 3 points.\nCapacité d'adaptation (10 points)\n83.\n(1) Un maximum de 10 points d'appréciation sont attribués au travailleur qualifié au titre de la capacité d'adaptation pour toute combinaison des éléments ci-après, selon le nombre indiqué:\na) pour les diplômes de l'époux ou du conjoint de fait, 3, 4 ou 5 points conformément au paragraphe (2);\n[. . . . .]\n(2) Pour l'application de l'alinéa (1)\na\n), l'agente évalue les diplômes de l'époux ou du conjoint de fait qui accompagne le travailleur qualifié comme s'il s'agissait du travailleur qualifié et lui attribue des points selon la grille suivante:\na) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 25 points, 5 points;\nb) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 20 ou 22 points, 4 points;\nc) dans le cas où l'époux ou le conjoint de fait obtiendrait 12 ou 15 points, 3 points.\n(1)\nDid the visa officer err in determining that she could not consider the applicant's post-secondary credentials because he had completed his studies as an external student\n?\n[19]\nFirst, it should be mentioned that, even if Mr. Hanif were to be awarded 20 additional points for his studies, he would have a total of only 66 points, which falls short of the 67 points required; therefore, to attain the points required, Mr. Hanif must also obtain points for the second question regarding the eligibility of his spouse's studies. Otherwise, subsection 76(3) of the Regulations grants the visa officer the discretion to substitute for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(\na\n) his or her evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada. This Court does not have to rule on that last question.\n[20]\nMr. Hanif provided evidence that he had obtained his degrees from the University of the Punjab. The following is the list of Mr. Hanif's studies:\n- Primary and secondary school diplomas;\n- Bachelor of Arts conferred by the University of the Punjab;\n- Bachelor of Laws conferred by the University of Karachi;\n- Master of Arts in political science conferred by the University of the Punjab;\n- Master of Arts in Punjabi conferred by the University of the Punjab.\nMr. Hanif claims that he completed 10 years of primary and secondary schooling and 11 years of post-secondary studies, totalling more than 20 years of formal training.\n[21]\nMr. Hanif claims that, according to paragraph 78(2)(\nf\n) of the Regulations, he should have been awarded 25 points because he had a university educational credential at the master's or doctoral level and a total of at least 17 years of full-time studies.\n[22]\nHowever, the Minister claims that the evidence showed that Mr. Hanif was an external or private student. Notes in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) indicate that the visa officer determined that the diplomas submitted seemed to be legitimate (Record at page 156). She also wrote in the CAIPS:\nEDUCATION: FN'S POST SECONDARY EDUCATION FROM U OF PUNJAB TAKEN AS A PRIVATE STUDENT PER TRANSCRIPTS. THESE DEGREES ARE OBTAINED AFTER PASSING THE REQUIRED EXAMS WITHOUT ATTENDING CLASS. THEREFORE, DOES NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF FULL TIME STUDENT AS SET OUT IN R78(1). POINTS AWARDED FOR EDUCATION WHERE FN WAS A FULL TIME STUDENT.\n(05 POINTS)\n(Record at page 156).\n[23]\nIn her affidavit, the visa officer explained her reasons for determining that Mr. Hanif had obtained his degrees as an external candidate:\n9. First, the introductory statement of both degrees reads: \"of the Sheikhupura district\". This means that the Applicant approached the University of Punjab as a resident of the Sheikhupura district and applied to write the final exam for each degree at the University of Punjab.\n10. Second, both degrees contain a \"z\" in the registration number. If a person is in full-time attendance at the University of Punjab, the registration number contains the initials of the college or high school that the person applied from, instead of the letter \"z\".\n(Affidavit of Janice Molsberry).\nThe visa officer found that, according to the facts, Mr. Hanif, as an external or private student, had never taken any classes at the University of the Punjab. Consequently, Mr. Hanif was not a regular full-time student as required by subsection 78(1) and paragraph 78(2)(\nd\n) of the Regulations.\n[24]\nThe definition of educational credential at section 73 of the Regulations does not indicate whether the applicant must have obtained the credential as an internal or external candidate. However, paragraph 78(2)(\nf\n) of the Regulations requires that the skilled worker must have obtained a university educational credential at the master's or doctoral level and a total of at least 17 years of full-time studies. The two statements in this paragraph are separated by \"and\", but it is not clear whether a university educational credential must have been obtained at the institution where the full-time studies were done. Consequently, the provision allows for the possibility of studying full time in one university while receiving a university degree from another.\n[25]\nThe recent decision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, rules on the same provisions with similar facts. Justice Orville Frenette found that the University of the Punjab was not an \"attending\" institution for undergraduate students:\n[38]\n... Rather, [the University of the Punjab] administered exams for those who have attended other institutions and conferred degrees accordingly. However, this did not mean that the Applicant did not receive a two-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level nor did it mean that he did not complete a total of fourteen years of schooling . ...\n[26]\nMoreover, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court found that the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan confirmed that Mr. Hameed's Bachelor of Arts degree conferred by the University of the Punjab was recognized as the equivalent to a corresponding bachelor's degree involving 14 years of schooling as awarded by other chartered universities/institutions ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 44). Even though this practice does not correspond exactly with Canadian standards, the guidelines do not call for comparisons to the Canadian educational system: \"Officers should assess programs of study and award points based on the standards that exist in the country of study\" (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Overseas Processing, OP6 Federal Skilled Workers Manual at section 10.2).\n[27]\nThe visa officer's determination that Mr. Hameed's degree was taken as a private student was completely irrelevant to the determination required to be made by subsection 78(2) of the Regulations:\n[45] [The provisions at subsection 78(2) of the Regulations require] only that the applicant demonstrate that he has a two-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time equivalent studies.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).\n[28]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Frenette ultimately found that the standards in Pakistan for granting a university bachelor's degree were met, regardless of whether the applicant attended the University of the Punjab as a private candidate or otherwise ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 48).\n[29]\nThe major difference between <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and this case is that Mr. Hameed submitted evidence confirming that he was a university-registered student in a Bachelor of Arts studies program recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.\n[30]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer was not satisfied that the applicant met the conditions set out in subsection 78(2) of the Regulations, as the applicant had not submitted any documents indicating that she had been awarded a credential for her studies:\n[8] The officer acknowledged that the applicant had taken an adult education course in accounting while living in Canada. However, given the applicant's failure to establish that the course was a course described in subsection 78(2) of the Regulations, the officer did not find that the accounting course justified the award of additional points.\n[9] I do not find that the officer erred in her assessment of the applicant's education. The applicant provided student transcripts from the Yorkdale Adult Learning Centre attesting to the accounting courses she had taken. However, none of these documents indicate that the applicant was awarded a credential for her studies. Thus, I find that the officer reasonably evaluated the evidence presented and awarded the applicant a sufficient number of points for her education.\n[31]\nIt is trite law that only information that was before the administrative tribunal can be considered by a reviewing court on judicial review. In this case, Mr. Hanif submitted no attendance record or transcript indicating that he was a full-time student. Therefore, to succeed, Mr. Hanif would require confirmation from the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan that the Bachelor of Arts conferred to Mr. Hanif by the University of the Punjab was recognized as the equivalent to a corresponding bachelor's degree as awarded by other chartered universities/institutions.\nIn other words, Mr. Hanif would need to provide an attendance record or a transcript indicating that he was a full-time student at another accredited university\n.\n[32]\nSince Mr. Hanif has not provided this type of evidence, the Court finds that the visa officer did not err in determining that she could not consider the applicant's post-secondary educational credentials.\n(2)\nDid the visa officer err in failing to consider, in her decision, the education of the applicant's spouse\n?\n[33]\nIn the CAIPS notes, the visa officer writes:\nFN IS MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN. SPOUSE AND CHILDREN ARE NOT ACCOMPANYING.\n. . . . .\nSPOUSE HOLDS BACHELORS DEGREE BUT NOT ACCOMPANYING AND NO FEES PAID. HOWEVER, SPOUSE WAS EXTERNAL STUDENT SO EVEN IF FEES PAID, NO POINTS WOULD BE AWARDED.\n(Record at pages 155-156).\n[34]\nIn the visa officer's affidavit, she states that Mr. Hanif's spouse was added as the worker's accompanying spouse. Therefore, the education of Mr. Hanif's spouse was considered. Mr. Hanif received no points because his wife's studies were not considered, since she was an external or private candidate. In following the above-mentioned analysis, the visa officer did not err in determining that she could not consider the post-secondary educational credentials of Mr. Hanif's spouse. There is no evidence in the record that Mr. Hanif's spouse was a full-time student at another accredited university.\n(3)\nDid the visa officer base her decision on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a capricious manner, without regard for the material and evidence before her\n?\n[35]\nWithin its jurisdiction, the Court has the discretion to quash the visa officer's decision if it was based on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before her (paragraph 18.1(4)(\nd\n) of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7).\n[36]\nThe visa officer made a number of findings regarding Mr. Hanif's post-secondary educational credentials, but the Court cannot disturb these findings absent unreasonableness. The CAIPS notes and the visa officer's affidavit provided a detailed explanation for her findings of fact relating to the documents submitted as proof of education. In this case, there is no unreasonable error.\nVII.\nConclusion\n[37]\nFor all these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n[38]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that\n1. The application for judicial review be dismissed;\n2. No serious question of general importance be certified.\n[End of document]",

TBEd. FE.003.\nI.\nAu préalable\n\n[1]\nJustice Shore\n: Evidence is not a toy to be manipulated in any way. Its meaning should be clear, clear and precise and unambiguous. The weakness within a proof is revealed when examined from all sides. Like a transparent crystal, its light, like its shadow, is demonstrated with time, devoted to observation. So the proof, in itself, should not become over time what it was not originally, a toy to be manipulated in one direction or another, dependent on the speaker ultimately demonstrating nonsense.\n\n[2] [9] I do not find that the officer erred in her assessment of the applicant's education. The applicant provided student transcripts from the Yorkdale Adult Learning Centre attesting to the accounting courses she had taken. However, none of these documents indicate that the applicant was awarded a credential for her studies. Thus, I find that the officer reasonably evaluated the evidence presented and awarded the applicant a sufficient number of points for her education.\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 166).\nII.\nJudicial proceeding\n\n[3]\nThis is an application for judicial review of the decision dated January 17, 2008, by a visa officer of the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, rejecting the applicant's application for permanent residence under the skilled workers class. The visa officer rejected the application on the basis that the applicant failed to obtain the 67 points required for the issuance of a visa under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 (Regulations).\nIII.\nFacts\n\n[4]\nThe applicant, Barar Hanif, is a political science specialist in Pakistan. He is married to Samina Choudhry, and they have two children. On January 10, 2002, he applied to the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, for permanent residency under the skilled workers class.\n\n[5]\nThe (federal) skilled worker class is evaluated on the basis of the minimal requirements set out in subsection 75(2) and the criteria set out in subsection 76(1) of the Regulations. The criteria refer to the following factors: age, education, language proficiency, experience, arranged employment and adaptability. A maximum of 25 points may be awarded for education, and subsection 78(2) of the Regulations indicates the number of points that may be awarded for specific \"educational credentials\".\n\n[6]\nThe applicant's application for permanent residence was refused in a letter dated January 17, 2008. That decision is the subject of this application.\nIV.\nDecision under review\n\n[7]\nThe visa officer made the following evaluation under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA):\n-\nPoints awarded\nMaximum\nAge\n10\n10\nEducation\n05\n25\nExperience\n21\n21\nArranged employment\n00\n10\nProficiency in the official languages of Canada:\n-\n-\nEnglish\n-\n-\nFrench\n05\n24\nAdaptability: Educational credentials of the skilled worker's accompanying spouse or accompanying common-law partner\n-\n-\nPrevious study in Canada\n-\n-\nArranged employment\n-\n-\nClose relatives in Canada\n05\n10\nTotal\n46\n100\n\n[8]\nAs Mr. Hanif obtained a total of only 46 points, whereas the minimum number required is 67, the visa officer refused the application for permanent residence because she was not satisfied that he would be able to become economically established in Canada.\n\n[9]\nMr. Hanif provided evidence that he had obtained four post-secondary educational credentials, namely, a Bachelor of Arts from the University of the Punjab, a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Karachi, a Master of Arts in political science from the University of the Punjab and a Master of Arts in Punjabi from the University of the Punjab. The visa officer awarded him only 5 points out of 25 points for education. In her refusal letter, she explained that Mr. Hanif's post-secondary studies do not meet the requirements of subsection 78(1) of the Regulations because he is considered to be an external or private candidate.\nV.\nIssues\n\n[10]\n(1) Did the visa officer err in determining that she could not consider the applicant's post-secondary credentials because he had completed his studies as an external student?\n(2) Did the visa officer err in failing to consider, in her decision, the education of the applicant's spouse?\n(3) Did the visa officer base her decision on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a capricious manner, without regard for the material and evidence before her?\nVI.\nAnalysis\nStandard of review\n\n[11]\nThe visa officer had to determine whether Mr. Hanif met the statutory requirements for obtaining points for his studies: \"... the Visa Officer was primarily engaged in factual determinations. Determinations of fact by a specialized decision-maker attract deference\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 516 at paragraph 22).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 145 at paragraphs 10-15, Justice Elizabeth Heneghan concluded, following a pragmatic and functional analysis, that the applicable standard of review is patent unreasonableness. Therefore, before\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] 1 S. C. R. 190, the appropriate standard of review to apply in the context of a visa officer's discretionary decision was patent unreasonableness (also: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 22-25;\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 282 at paragraph 15).\n\n[12] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 57 and 62, states that, if a standard of review has already been determined, the four factors of the former pragmatic and functional analysis should not be applied. In this case, since the visa officer's decision is one based on an analysis of the facts, the standard of review is reasonableness.\nLegislation\n\n[13]\nSubsection 12(2) of the IRPA governs the selection of permanent residents based on economic reasons:\nEconomic immigration\n12\n. (2) A foreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.\nImmigration économique\n12.\n(2) La sélection des étrangers de la catégorie  immigration économique  se fait en fonction de leur capacité à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada.\n\n[14]\nSections 73 to 85 of the Regulations govern the evaluation of applications for permanent residence in the (federal) skilled worker class. The relevant provisions of the Regulations are those relating to the evaluation of studies.\n\n[15]\nThe definition of the diploma in the Regulations is as follows:\n73\n. The following definitions apply to this section.\n diploma Any diploma, certificate of competence or certificate of apprenticeship obtained following the successful completion of a program of study or a training course offered by an educational or training establishment recognized by the authorities responsible for registering, accrediting, supervising and regulating educational establishments in the country of issue of this diploma or certificate. (\neducational credential\n)\n73.\nThe definitions in this section apply in this Division.\n\"educational credential\" means any diploma, degree or trade or apprenticeship credential issued on the completion of a program of study or training at an educational or training institution recognized by the authorities responsible for registering, accrediting, supervising and regulating such institutions in the country of issue. (\ndiploma\n)\n\n[16]\nThe definition of full-time and full-time equivalent are as follows:\n78\n. (1) The following definitions apply in this section.\n full-time equivalent In relation to such number of years of full-time studies, the number of years of part-time studies or accelerated studies that would have been necessary to complete equivalent studies. (\nfull-time equivalent\n)\n full-time With regard to a program of study which leads to the obtaining of a diploma, corresponds to fifteen hours of classes per week during the school year, and includes any period of training given in the workplace and forming part of the program (\nfull-time\n).\n78.\n(1) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section.\n\"full-time\" means, in relation to a program of study leading to an educational credential, at least 15 hours of instruction per week during the academic year, including any period of training in the workplace that forms part of the course of instruction. (\nfull time\n)\n\"full-time equivalent\" means, in respect of part-time or accelerated studies, the period that would have been required to complete those studies on a full-time basis.

therefore, to attain the points required, Mr. Hanif must also obtain points for the second question regarding the eligibility of his spouse's studies. Otherwise, subsection 76(3) of the Regulations grants the visa officer the discretion to substitute for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(\na\n) his or her evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada. This Court does not have to rule on that last question.\n\n[20]\nMr. Hanif provided evidence that he had obtained his degrees from the University of the Punjab. The following is the list of Mr. Hanif's studies:\n- Primary and secondary school diplomas;\n- Bachelor of Arts conferred by the University of the Punjab;\n- Bachelor of Laws conferred by the University of Karachi;\n- Master of Arts in political science conferred by the University of the Punjab;\n- Master of Arts in Punjabi conferred by the University of the Punjab.\nMr. Hanif claims that he completed 10 years of primary and secondary schooling and 11 years of post-secondary studies, totalling more than 20 years of formal training.\n\n[21]\nMr. Hanif claims that, according to paragraph 78(2)(\nf\n) of the Regulations, he should have been awarded 25 points because he had a university educational credential at the master's or doctoral level and a total of at least 17 years of full-time studies.\n\n[22]\nHowever, the Minister claims that the evidence showed that Mr. Hanif was an external or private student. Notes in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) indicate that the visa officer determined that the diplomas submitted seemed to be legitimate (Record at page 156). She also wrote in the CAIPS:\nEDUCATION: FN'S POST SECONDARY EDUCATION FROM U OF PUNJAB TAKEN AS A PRIVATE STUDENT PER TRANSCRIPTS. THESE DEGREES ARE OBTAINED AFTER PASSING THE REQUIRED EXAMS WITHOUT ATTENDING CLASS. THEREFORE, DOES NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF FULL TIME STUDENT AS SET OUT IN R78(1). POINTS AWARDED FOR EDUCATION WHERE FN WAS A FULL TIME STUDENT.\n(05 POINTS)\n(Record at page 156).\n\n[23]\nDans son affidavit, l'agente des visas a élaboré ses raisons pour déterminer que monsieur Hanif a obtenu ses diplômes comme candidat externe:\n9. First, the introductory statement of both degrees reads: \"of the Sheikhupura district\". This means that the Applicant approached the University of Punjab as a resident of the Sheikhupura district and applied to write the final exam for each degree at the University of Punjab.\n10. Second, both degrees contain a \"z\" in the registration number. If a person is in full-time attendance at the University of Punjab, the registration number contains the initials of the college or high school that the person applied from, instead of the letter \"z\".\n(Affidavit de Janice Molsberry.)\nComme étudiant externe ou privé, l'agente des visas a déterminé que les faits démontrent que monsieur Hanif n'a jamais suivi des cours à l'Université de Punjab. Par conséquent, monsieur Hanif n'était pas un étudiant régulier à temps plein comme requis par le paragraphe 78(1) et l'alinéa 78(2)\nd\n) du Règlement.\n\n[24]\nThe definition of educational credential at section 73 of the Regulations does not indicate whether the applicant must have obtained the credential as an internal or external candidate. However, paragraph 78(2)(\nf\n) of the Regulations requires that the skilled worker must have obtained a university educational credential at the master's or doctoral level and a total of at least 17 years of full-time studies. The two statements in this paragraph are separated by \"and\", but it is not clear whether a university educational credential must have been obtained at the institution where the full-time studies were done. Consequently, the provision allows for the possibility of studying full time in one university while receiving a university degree from another.\n\n[25]\nThe recent decision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, rules on the same provisions with similar facts. Justice Orville Frenette found that the University of the Punjab was not an \"attending\" institution for undergraduate students: [38]\n... Rather, [the University of the Punjab] administered exams for those who have attended other institutions and conferred degrees accordingly. However, this did not mean that the Applicant did not receive a two-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level nor did it mean that he did not complete a total of fourteen years of schooling . ...\n\n[26]\nMoreover, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court found that the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan confirmed that Mr. Hameed's Bachelor of Arts degree conferred by the University of the Punjab was recognized as the equivalent to a corresponding bachelor's degree involving 14 years of schooling as awarded by other chartered universities/institutions ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 44). Even though this practice does not correspond exactly with Canadian standards, the guidelines do not call for comparisons to the Canadian educational system: \"Officers should assess programs of study and award points based on the standards that exist in the country of study\" (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Overseas Processing, OP6 Federal Skilled Workers Manual at section 10.2).\n\n[27]\nThe visa officer's determination that Mr. Hameed's degree was taken as a private student was completely irrelevant to the determination required to be made by subsection 78(2) of the Regulations: [45] [The provisions at subsection 78(2) of the Regulations require] only that the applicant demonstrate that he has a two-year university educational credential at the bachelor's level and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time equivalent studies.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).\n\n[28]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Frenette ultimately found that the standards in Pakistan for granting a university bachelor's degree were met, regardless of whether the applicant attended the University of the Punjab as a private candidate or otherwise ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 48).\n\n[29]\nThe major difference between <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and this case is that Mr. Hameed submitted evidence confirming that he was a university-registered student in a Bachelor of Arts studies program recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.\n\n[30]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer was not satisfied that the applicant met the conditions set out in subsection 78(2) of the Regulations, as the applicant had not submitted any documents indicating that she had been awarded a credential for her studies: [8] The officer acknowledged that the applicant had taken an adult education course in accounting while living in Canada. However, given the applicant's failure to establish that the course was a course described in subsection 78(2) of the Regulations, the officer did not find that the accounting course justified the award of additional points. [9] I do not find that the officer erred in her assessment of the applicant's education. The applicant provided student transcripts from the Yorkdale Adult Learning Centre attesting to the accounting courses she had taken. However, none of these documents indicate that the applicant was awarded a credential for her studies. Thus, I find that the officer reasonably evaluated the evidence presented and awarded the applicant a sufficient number of points for her education.\n\n[31]\nIt is trite law that only information that was before the administrative tribunal can be considered by a reviewing court on judicial review. In this case, Mr. Hanif submitted no attendance record or transcript indicating that he was a full-time student. Therefore, to succeed, Mr. Hanif would require confirmation from the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan that the Bachelor of Arts conferred to Mr. Hanif by the University of the Punjab was recognized as the equivalent to a corresponding bachelor's degree as awarded by other chartered universities/institutions.\nIn other words, Mr. Hanif would need to provide an attendance record or a transcript indicating that he was a full-time student at another accredited university\n.\n\n[32]\nSince Mr. Hanif has not provided this type of evidence, the Court finds that the visa officer did not err in determining that she could not consider the applicant's post-secondary educational credentials.\n(2)\nDid the visa officer err in failing to consider, in her decision, the education of the applicant's spouse\n?\n\n[33]\nIn the CAIPS notes, the visa officer writes:\nFN IS MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN. SPOUSE AND CHILDREN ARE NOT ACCOMPANYING.\n. . . . .\nSPOUSE HOLDS BACHELORS DEGREE BUT NOT ACCOMPANYING AND NO FEES PAID. HOWEVER, SPOUSE WAS EXTERNAL STUDENT SO EVEN IF FEES PAID, NO POINTS WOULD BE AWARDED.\n(Record at pages 155-156).\n\n[34]\nIn the visa officer's affidavit, she states that Mr. Hanif's spouse was added as the worker's accompanying spouse. Therefore, the education of Mr. Hanif's spouse was considered. Mr. Hanif received no points because his wife's studies were not considered, since she was an external or private candidate. In following the above-mentioned analysis, the visa officer did not err in determining that she could not consider the post-secondary educational credentials of Mr. Hanif's spouse. There is no evidence in the record that Mr. Hanif's spouse was a full-time student at another accredited university.\n(3)\nDid the visa officer base her decision on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a capricious manner, without regard for the material and evidence before her\n?\n\n[35]\nWithin its jurisdiction, the Court has the discretion to quash the visa officer's decision if it was based on an erroneous finding of fact that she made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before her (paragraph 18.1(4)(\nd\n) of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7).\n\n[36]\nThe visa officer made a number of findings regarding Mr. Hanif's post-secondary educational credentials, but the Court cannot disturb these findings absent unreasonableness. The CAIPS notes and the visa officer's affidavit provided a detailed explanation for her findings of fact relating to the documents submitted as proof of education. In this case, there is no unreasonable error.\nVII.\nConclusion\n\n[37]\nFor all these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[38]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée;\n2. Aucune question grave de portée générale ne soit certifiée.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is not a toy to be manipulated any which way. Its meaning should be clear, precise and unambiguous. Examining a piece of evidence from all angles reveals its inner weakness. Like a transparent crystal, it will cast light, as well as shadows, when observed over time. Therefore, with the passage of time, evidence in and of itself should not turn into something it never was to begin with; it should not be a toy to be manipulated one way or another, depending on the parties involved, to become, ultimately, meaningless.",
