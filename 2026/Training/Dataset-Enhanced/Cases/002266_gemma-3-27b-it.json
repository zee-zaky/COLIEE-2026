    "[1]\nRennie, J.\n: This decision arises from an application for judicial review of a March 23, 2011 decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) that found that the applicants were neither Convention (United Nations'\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] Can TS No 6) refugees under section 96 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (\nIRPA\n) nor persons in need of protection under section 97 of the\nIRPA\n.",
    "[2]\nThe issue before this Court is whether the Board erred in its analysis under section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the\nIRPA\n. A second issue arises from the Board's findings on state protection; however, as the Board reasonably concluded that the applicants would not be subject to a risk not faced generally by other individuals in Mexico, the state protection issue need not be addressed. The third ground of review, breach of the principles of natural justice, was abandoned by the applicants at the outset of argument.\nFacts",
    "[3]\nThe principal applicant, Javier Camargo Vivero (applicant), his spouse and their minor child are originally from Cordoba, Veracruz, Mexico. The applicant was a self-employed auto-mechanic and his wife a self-employed graphic designer. On November 12, 2008, he was kidnapped, assaulted and held for a one million peso ransom by 'Los Zetas' (Zetas), a criminal gang in Mexico. His wife raised almost half of that in order to secure his release. The applicant was then instructed by the Zetas to pay 20,000 pesos each month in order to prevent harm to himself, his wife and child. He was told not to go to the police. He was told that his telephone would be monitored. He was told that he would be watched. He testified that both he and his home were, on occasion, under surveillance.",
    "[4]\nThe applicant spoke about the situation with some of his clients who were police officers. He was told by these officers that nothing could be done but to pay the ransom or close his business and move away. He thus did not report the kidnapping, the assault or the extortion threats to the police. By July 2009, the Zetas had increased the monthly extortionary rate to 25,000 pesos. The applicant testified that he thought of moving to another part of Mexico, but feared reprisals from the Zetas for closing his business and avoiding them. In the early hours of January 15, 2010, the applicants left their home, most of their possessions and drove to the airport. They arrived in Canada and made a claim for refugee status that day.",
    "[5]\nThe Board refused the claims on March 23, 2011, the same day as the hearing, and rendered its written decision on April 11, 2011, finding that:\n....there is no nexus to a Convention ground. That is to say, you do not fear the Los Zetas criminal gang on the basis of your nationality or your race or your religion or your political opinion. I do not find that you are members of a particular social group in terms of your fear of Los Zetas. You are victims of kidnapping, assault, death threats and extortion. In other words, you are victims of crime in Mexico. Victimization alone cannot form the basis of your membership in a particular social group. I am not of the view the principal claimant's status as a successful businessman in Mexico forms the basis of a particular social group.",
    "[6]\nThe Board further developed this finding, and added that:\nThere was no evidence before me demonstrating that you were targeted by Los Zetas for any reason other than your perceived wealth. The Zetas were looking for anyone who could pay them. The motivation to target you was purely financial, with your perceived wealth being the probable cause. As such, your fear results from criminality which does not constitute a fear of persecution based on a Convention ground as was found in the cases of\nLarenas\nand\nVikram\n...",
    "[7]\nHaving concluded that a claim under section 96 had not been established, the Board then considered whether the criteria of section 97 of the\nIRPA\nhad been satisfied. The Board stated:\n...I must assess your claims under subsection 97(1) of the Act on a balance of probabilities. I note that there is no evidence of continued threat or risk from these particular gang members. While you believe there would be serious consequences if Los Zetas found you in Mexico, there is no evidence that they continue to actively search for you. This confirms my conclusion that their main interest in you was money. While I accept that you continue to fear those who kidnapped and extorted you, I find that the risk you face is unfortunately a generalized one. In a country in which there is a high crime rate, that undermines the security of all citizens.\nThe particular facts of the claimant must be distinguished in order to satisfy the requirements of section 97(1) of the Act. In other words, you must face a more personalized risk than other Mexicans, including other small business owners and families.\nEven if I found that your perceived wealth placed you at a higher risk than lower income individuals, your case is still not made out. [Emphasis added]",
    "[8]\nAfter also finding that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, the Board concluded that the applicants did not fall within the scope of section 97 of the\nIRPA\n.\nOverview",
    "[9]\nThe issue before the Court was whether there is a divergence in the jurisprudence with respect to section 97, as set forth in Annex A to this Judgment.",
    "[10]\nThe thrust of the applicant's argument was that there were two lines of divergent authority with respect to section 97(1)(b)(ii) and the ambit or extent of the proviso that the risk \"... is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\" It was argued that certain decisions hold that acts of ordinary criminality can satisfy the second part of the test, and that under a second line of authority, acts of criminality cannot satisfy the test.",
    "[11]\nIn my view, there is no divergence in the jurisprudence; rather differences in the outcomes of section 97 cases stem from the need for an individualized inquiry in each case. In every instance, the Board must determine if all the requirements of section 97 are met, which includes a determination of whether the claimant would personally face a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment,\nand\nwhether that risk is faced generally by other individuals in or from that country. It is therefore an error to fail to consider whether the claimant faces a personalized risk, or to conflate that question with whether the risk is a general risk. It is also an error to conflate the risk with the reason for it; thus, the fact that the risk arises from criminal activity is not itself relevant to the question of whether the requirements of section 97 are met.",
    "[12]\nIn this case, however, the Board did conduct an individualized inquiry and found that the applicants were not subject to a risk that was not faced generally by other individuals in Mexico. This conclusion was reasonably open to the Board, and the application must therefore be dismissed.\nAnalysis",
    "[13]\nIn many decisions of this Court, the Court has upheld findings that claimants faced only a general risk faced by other individuals in their country. For example, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice John O'Keefe held at paragraph 25:\nThe applicants are members of a large group of people who may be targeted for economic crimes in Honduras on the basis of their perceived wealth. The applicants submitted that the Board erred in imposing too high a standard upon them in requiring that they prove that they would be personally at risk. Given the wording of subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of IRPA, the applicants had to satisfy the Board that they would be personally subjected to a risk that was not generally faced by others in Honduras.",
    "[14] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was favourably cited shortly thereafter by Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where she held at paragraph 23:\nBased on the recent jurisprudence of this Court, I am of the view that the applicant does not face a personalized risk that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from Haiti. The risk of all forms of criminality is general and felt by all Haitians. While a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, all Haitians are at risk of becoming the victims of violence.",
    "[15]\nThis Court would also follow this line of reasoning in cases such as\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . A passage from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is particularly instructive. Justice Johanne Gauthier (now of the Court of Appeal) wrote at paragraph 16:\nThe applicant referred to a passage of the documentary evidence which confirms that bus fare collectors are frequently subject to extortion by the Gang. However, the Board examined this country documentation and found it to clearly indicate the prevalence of gang related violence in a variety of sectors. It is no more unreasonable to find that a particular group that is targeted, be it bus fare collectors or other victims of extortion and who do not pay, faces generalised violence than to reach the same conclusion in respect of well known wealthy business men in Haiti who were clearly found to be at a heightened risk of facing the violence prevalent in that country.",
    "[16]\nThe genesis of what was argued to be an alternative approach to section 97(1)(b)(ii) lies in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, the applicant had been threatened by armed members of the Maras Salvatruchas on several occasions, both at his home and at university. In setting aside the decision Justice Yves de Montigny wrote at paragraphs 13 and 15:\nIn short, the risk faced by an applicant ought not to be a random and generalized risk indiscriminately faced by all persons living in the country to which the applicant risks to be removed. In this case, the applicant submitted in his Personal Information Form (PIF) that he had been personally subjected to danger; yet the RPD did not take this into account and rather put the accent on the fact that Mr. Pineda had stated in his testimony that the Maras Salvatruchas recruited across the country and targeted all levels of society, regardless of the age of the persons contemplated.\n[...]\nUnder these circumstances, the RPD's finding is patently unreasonable. It cannot be accepted, by implication at least, that the applicant had been threatened by a well-organized gang that was terrorizing the entire country, according to the documentary evidence, and in the same breath surmise that this same applicant would not be exposed to a personal risk if he were to return to El Salvador. It could very well be that the Maras Salvatruchas recruit from the general population; the fact remains that Mr. Pineda, if his testimony is to be believed, had been specifically targeted and was subjected to repeated threats and attacks. On that basis, he was subjected to a greater risk than the risk faced by the population in general.",
    "[17]\nIn the subsequent decision of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Eleanor Dawson, (now of the Court of Appeal) analyzed section 97(1)(b)(ii) and its underlying objectives. Justice Dawson noted that the concept embedded in section 97(1)(b)(ii) was not new, but had its antecedence in the\nImmigration Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c-2 and the Regulations which required a claimant to establish \"an objectively identifiable risk, which risk would apply in every part of that country and would not be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\" Justice Dawson turned next, at paragraph 17, to the guidelines published by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration which informed the interpretation of various elements contained in the definition of the post-determination refugee claimants in Canada (PDRCC) class:\nThe Department of Citizenship and Immigration published guidelines to assist officers in the interpretation of the various elements contained in the definition of the PDRCC class. With respect to the requirement that the risk \"would not be faced generally by other individuals\" the guidelines instructed officers that:\nThe threat is not restricted to a risk personalized to an individual; it includes risks faced by individuals that may be shared by others who are similarly situated\n. Neither are risks restricted by ethnic, political, religious or social factors as the concept of persecution is in the Convention refugee definition. Whether or not the risk is associated with a \"Convention\" ground, a person may fall within the scope of this definition. Notwithstanding this, the limitation imposed by the PDRCC definition in the phrase \"which risk ... would not be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country\" applies.\nAny risk that would apply to all residents or citizens of the country of origin cannot result in a positive decision under this Regulation\n. [emphasis added]\n[Emphasis in original]",
    "[18]\nJustice Dawson concluded that the Board must consider whether the risk is faced generally by all other persons living in the country.",
    "[19]\nA decade earlier, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Donna McGillis also referred to the guidelines, at paragraph 37, to help articulate the scope of the requirement under what is now section 97(1)(b)(ii):\nIn particular, the PDRCC class guidelines emphasize that the criteria in subsection 2(1) of the Regulations are not only restricted to \"a risk personalized to an individual\", but also include a risk faced by others similarly situated. Furthermore, the guidelines interpret the exclusionary phrase in the Regulations that the risk must not be \"faced generally by other individuals\", as meaning a risk faced by all residents or citizens of that country. Indeed, during his cross-examination, Gilbert Troutet, a specialist in PDRCC class applications, stated that the exclusion would apply only \"in extreme situations such as a generalized disaster of some sort that would involve all of the inhabitants of a given country. And if such a situation does occur, the [respondent] has specific programs to cover such situations.\" [Footnote omitted]",
    "[20]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Simon Noël found at paragraph 17 that the Board erred by failing to consider whether the risk faced by the applicant was different from the general risk created by ordinary criminal activity:\nAs was the case in\nMartinez Pineda\n, the Board erred in its decision: it focused on the generalized threat suffered by the population of Guatemala while failing to consider the Applicant's particular situation. Because the Applicant's credibility was not in question, the Board had the duty to fully analyse and appreciate the personalized risk faced by the Applicant in order to render a complete analysis of the Applicant's claim for asylum under section 97 of the IRPA. It appears that the Applicant was not targeted in the same manner as any other vendor in the market: reprisal was sought because he had collaborated with authorities, refused to comply with the gang's requests and knew of the circumstance of Mr. Vicente's death.",
    "[21]\nI understand\nAguilar Zacarias\nto require the Board to consider both whether there is a personal risk\nand\nwhether that risk is not faced generally by others in the country.",
    "[22]\nTo conclude, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Russel Zinn observed at paragraph 27 that many cases of the Board and this Court have offered confusing reasoning on this point, and he made several helpful comments about the proper analysis to undertake in determining a section 97 claim:\nThe majority of cases turn on whether or not the last condition has been satisfied, that is, whether the risk faced by the claimant is a risk faced generally by others in the country. I pause to observe that regrettably too many decisions of the RPD and of this Court use imprecise language in this regard. No doubt I too have been guilty of this. Specifically, many decisions state or imply that a generalized risk is not a personal risk. What is usually meant is that the claimant's risk is one faced generally by others and thus the claimant does not meet the requirements of the Act. It is not meant that the claimant has no personal risk. It is important that a decision-maker finds that a claimant has a personal risk because if there is no personal risk to the claimant, then there is no need to do any further analysis of the claim; there is simply no risk. It is only after finding that there is a personal risk that a decision-maker must continue to consider whether that risk is one faced generally by the population.",
    "[23]\nJustice Zinn also noted that decision-makers are often imprecise about the risk itself; thus, the Board sometimes fails to identify the risk, or conflates the risk with the reason for it, both of which constitute an error. He stated at paragraph 29:\nAn example of the sort of decision I am addressing is that under review. The closest the decision-maker in this case comes to actually stating the risk she finds this applicant faces is the following: \"[T]he harm feared by the claimant; that is criminality (recruitment to deliver drugs) ....\" But this is not the risk faced by the applicant, and even if it were, the decision fails to state how this meets the test of risk set out in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act. At best, the risk as described forms part of the reason for the risk to the applicant's life. When one conflates the reason for the risk with the risk itself, one fails to properly conduct the individualized inquiry of the claim that is essential to a proper s. 97 analysis and determination.",
    "[24]\nThe respondent asserts that a risk of violence from criminal activity is a risk faced generally by individuals in Mexico and therefore cannot support a section 97 claim. However,\nCorado  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , holds that position to be contrary to the requirement of an individualized inquiry in each case, and to the line of cases to which I have referred finding a personal risk arising from criminal gang activity:\nMartinez Pineda\n;\nAguilar Zacarias\n;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[25]\nI agree with the reasons of Justice Zinn quoted in the paragraphs above. The fact that the risk faced by an applicant arises from criminal activity does not in itself mean that the risk is one faced generally by other individuals in the country - rather, each case must be assessed on its facts to determine if the requirements of section 97 are met, as some risks arising from criminal activity will constitute a general risk, and others will not.",
    "[26]\nIn this case, the Board did undertake in individualized inquiry and concluded that the prospective risk faced by the applicants was no more than the general risk faced by other individuals in Mexico. The Board based this conclusion on the finding that the Zetas did not appear to be continuing to search for the applicant, and therefore that gang did not present a continued threat:\n...\nI note that there is no evidence of continued threat or risk from these particular gang members\n. While you believe there would be serious consequences if Los Zetas found you in Mexico,\nthere is no evidence that they continue to actively search for you\n. This confirms my conclusion that their main interest in you was money. While I accept that you continue to fear those who kidnapped and extorted you,\nI find that the risk you face is unfortunately a generalized one\n. In a country in which there is a high crime rate, that undermines the security of all citizens. The particular facts of the claimant must be distinguished in order to satisfy the requirements of section 97(1) of the Act ... [Emphasis added]",
    "[27]\nBecause the Board did not accept the evidence that the Zetas would continue to pursue the applicant, the Board concluded that the future risk faced by the applicants was no more than the general risk of violence from criminal activity faced by all Mexicans. These findings were specific to the applicants' circumstances, and they were reasonably open to the Board. The Court therefore has no basis to intervene.\nConclusion",
    "[28]\nIt must be remembered that Parliament is presumed not to have enacted legislation that is devoid of content; thus, the interpretation of section 97 frequently relied on by the Refugee Protection Division cannot be supported: for example, it would not protect individuals from natural disasters, as natural disasters affect everyone; it would not protect individuals from criminal acts, as all are at risk of extortion. Section 97 would thus be reduced, in its application, to the protection of individuals who are victimized by criminal acts in countries where the risk of criminality is not widespread or prevalent. In these cases, state protection, logically, is likely to be available. In consequence, section 97 would be stripped of any content and bereft of meaning, a legislative section in search of meaning.",
    "[29]\nAs discussed above, the respondent's position stems from a misplaced focus on the reason for the risk - the question is not whether the risk to a claimant is created by criminal activity, but rather whether the claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to his or her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and whether that risk is one not faced generally by other individuals in or from the country. If the Board fails to undertake an individualized inquiry to determine those questions the Court will have basis to intervene.",
    "[30]\nIn this case, the Board's decision can be upheld, but not for the reason that citizens of Mexico are at a general risk of violence from criminal activity - a section 97 claim could potentially succeed based on a risk from gang violence in Mexico, depending on the circumstances. However, in this case the applicants' circumstances were considered, and the Board reasonably concluded that they faced no more than a risk faced generally by others in Mexico. The application is therefore dismissed.",
    "[31]\nNo questions were proposed for certification and none arise.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[32]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application is dismissed. No question has been proposed for certification.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Angela E.

  "full_text": "[1]\nRennie, J.\n: This decision arises from an application for judicial review of a March 23, 2011 decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) that found that the applicants were neither Convention (United Nations'\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] Can TS No 6) refugees under section 96 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (\nIRPA\n) nor persons in need of protection under section 97 of the\nIRPA\n.\n[2]\nThe issue before this Court is whether the Board erred in its analysis under section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the\nIRPA\n. A second issue arises from the Board's findings on state protection; however, as the Board reasonably concluded that the applicants would not be subject to a risk not faced generally by other individuals in Mexico, the state protection issue need not be addressed.

In setting aside the decision Justice Yves de Montigny wrote at paragraphs 13 and 15:\nIn short, the risk faced by an applicant ought not to be a random and generalized risk indiscriminately faced by all persons living in the country to which the applicant risks to be removed. In this case, the applicant submitted in his Personal Information Form (PIF) that he had been personally subjected to danger; yet the RPD did not take this into account and rather put the accent on the fact that Mr. Pineda had stated in his testimony that the Maras Salvatruchas recruited across the country and targeted all levels of society, regardless of the age of the persons contemplated.\n[...]\nUnder these circumstances, the RPD's finding is patently unreasonable. It cannot be accepted, by implication at least, that the applicant had been threatened by a well-organized gang that was terrorizing the entire country, according to the documentary evidence, and in the same breath surmise that this same applicant would not be exposed to a personal risk if he were to return to El Salvador. It could very well be that the Maras Salvatruchas recruit from the general population; the fact remains that Mr. Pineda, if his testimony is to be believed, had been specifically targeted and was subjected to repeated threats and attacks. On that basis, he was subjected to a greater risk than the risk faced by the population in general.\n[17]\nIn the subsequent decision of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Eleanor Dawson, (now of the Court of Appeal) analyzed section 97(1)(b)(ii) and its underlying objectives. Justice Dawson noted that the concept embedded in section 97(1)(b)(ii) was not new, but had its antecedence in the\nImmigration Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c-2 and the Regulations which required a claimant to establish \"an objectively identifiable risk, which risk would apply in every part of that country and would not be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\" Justice Dawson turned next, at paragraph 17, to the guidelines published by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration which informed the interpretation of various elements contained in the definition of the post-determination refugee claimants in Canada (PDRCC) class:\nThe Department of Citizenship and Immigration published guidelines to assist officers in the interpretation of the various elements contained in the definition of the PDRCC class. With respect to the requirement that the risk \"would not be faced generally by other individuals\" the guidelines instructed officers that:\nThe threat is not restricted to a risk personalized to an individual; it includes risks faced by individuals that may be shared by others who are similarly situated\n. Neither are risks restricted by ethnic, political, religious or social factors as the concept of persecution is in the Convention refugee definition. Whether or not the risk is associated with a \"Convention\" ground, a person may fall within the scope of this definition. Notwithstanding this, the limitation imposed by the PDRCC definition in the phrase \"which risk ... would not be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country\" applies.\nAny risk that would apply to all residents or citizens of the country of origin cannot result in a positive decision under this Regulation\n. [emphasis added]\n[Emphasis in original]\n[18]\nJustice Dawson concluded that the Board must consider whether the risk is faced generally by all other persons living in the country.\n[19]\nA decade earlier, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Donna McGillis also referred to the guidelines, at paragraph 37, to help articulate the scope of the requirement under what is now section 97(1)(b)(ii):\nIn particular, the PDRCC class guidelines emphasize that the criteria in subsection 2(1) of the Regulations are not only restricted to \"a risk personalized to an individual\", but also include a risk faced by others similarly situated. Furthermore, the guidelines interpret the exclusionary phrase in the Regulations that the risk must not be \"faced generally by other individuals\", as meaning a risk faced by all residents or citizens of that country. Indeed, during his cross-examination, Gilbert Troutet, a specialist in PDRCC class applications, stated that the exclusion would apply only \"in extreme situations such as a generalized disaster of some sort that would involve all of the inhabitants of a given country. And if such a situation does occur, the [respondent] has specific programs to cover such situations.\" [Footnote omitted]\n[20]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Simon Noël found at paragraph 17 that the Board erred by failing to consider whether the risk faced by the applicant was different from the general risk created by ordinary criminal activity:\nAs was the case in\nMartinez Pineda\n, the Board erred in its decision: it focused on the generalized threat suffered by the population of Guatemala while failing to consider the Applicant's particular situation. Because the Applicant's credibility was not in question, the Board had the duty to fully analyse and appreciate the personalized risk faced by the Applicant in order to render a complete analysis of the Applicant's claim for asylum under section 97 of the IRPA. It appears that the Applicant was not targeted in the same manner as any other vendor in the market: reprisal was sought because he had collaborated with authorities, refused to comply with the gang's requests and knew of the circumstance of Mr. Vicente's death.\n[21]\nI understand\nAguilar Zacarias\nto require the Board to consider both whether there is a personal risk\nand\nwhether that risk is not faced generally by others in the country.\n[22]\nTo conclude, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Russel Zinn observed at paragraph 27 that many cases of the Board and this Court have offered confusing reasoning on this point, and he made several helpful comments about the proper analysis to undertake in determining a section 97 claim:\nThe majority of cases turn on whether or not the last condition has been satisfied, that is, whether the risk faced by the claimant is a risk faced generally by others in the country. I pause to observe that regrettably too many decisions of the RPD and of this Court use imprecise language in this regard. No doubt I too have been guilty of this. Specifically, many decisions state or imply that a generalized risk is not a personal risk. What is usually meant is that the claimant's risk is one faced generally by others and thus the claimant does not meet the requirements of the Act. It is not meant that the claimant has no personal risk. It is important that a decision-maker finds that a claimant has a personal risk because if there is no personal risk to the claimant, then there is no need to do any further analysis of the claim; there is simply no risk. It is only after finding that there is a personal risk that a decision-maker must continue to consider whether that risk is one faced generally by the population.\n[23]\nJustice Zinn also noted that decision-makers are often imprecise about the risk itself; thus, the Board sometimes fails to identify the risk, or conflates the risk with the reason for it, both of which constitute an error. He stated at paragraph 29:\nAn example of the sort of decision I am addressing is that under review. The closest the decision-maker in this case comes to actually stating the risk she finds this applicant faces is the following: \"[T]he harm feared by the claimant; that is criminality (recruitment to deliver drugs) ....\" But this is not the risk faced by the applicant, and even if it were, the decision fails to state how this meets the test of risk set out in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act. At best, the risk as described forms part of the reason for the risk to the applicant's life. When one conflates the reason for the risk with the risk itself, one fails to properly conduct the individualized inquiry of the claim that is essential to a proper s. 97 analysis and determination.\n[24]\nThe respondent asserts that a risk of violence from criminal activity is a risk faced generally by individuals in Mexico and therefore cannot support a section 97 claim. However,\nCorado  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , holds that position to be contrary to the requirement of an individualized inquiry in each case, and to the line of cases to which I have referred finding a personal risk arising from criminal gang activity:\nMartinez Pineda\n;\nAguilar Zacarias\n;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[25]\nI agree with the reasons of Justice Zinn quoted in the paragraphs above. The fact that the risk faced by an applicant arises from criminal activity does not in itself mean that the risk is one faced generally by other individuals in the country - rather, each case must be assessed on its facts to determine if the requirements of section 97 are met, as some risks arising from criminal activity will constitute a general risk, and others will not.\n[26]\nIn this case, the Board did undertake in individualized inquiry and concluded that the prospective risk faced by the applicants was no more than the general risk faced by other individuals in Mexico. The Board based this conclusion on the finding that the Zetas did not appear to be continuing to search for the applicant, and therefore that gang did not present a continued threat:\n...\nI note that there is no evidence of continued threat or risk from these particular gang members\n. While you believe there would be serious consequences if Los Zetas found you in Mexico,\nthere is no evidence that they continue to actively search for you\n. This confirms my conclusion that their main interest in you was money. While I accept that you continue to fear those who kidnapped and extorted you,\nI find that the risk you face is unfortunately a generalized one\n. In a country in which there is a high crime rate, that undermines the security of all citizens. The particular facts of the claimant must be distinguished in order to satisfy the requirements of section 97(1) of the Act ... [Emphasis added]\n[27]\nBecause the Board did not accept the evidence that the Zetas would continue to pursue the applicant, the Board concluded that the future risk faced by the applicants was no more than the general risk of violence from criminal activity faced by all Mexicans. These findings were specific to the applicants' circumstances, and they were reasonably open to the Board. The Court therefore has no basis to intervene.\nConclusion\n[28]\nIt must be remembered that Parliament is presumed not to have enacted legislation that is devoid of content; thus, the interpretation of section 97 frequently relied on by the Refugee Protection Division cannot be supported: for example, it would not protect individuals from natural disasters, as natural disasters affect everyone; it would not protect individuals from criminal acts, as all are at risk of extortion. Section 97 would thus be reduced, in its application, to the protection of individuals who are victimized by criminal acts in countries where the risk of criminality is not widespread or prevalent. In these cases, state protection, logically, is likely to be available. In consequence, section 97 would be stripped of any content and bereft of meaning, a legislative section in search of meaning.\n[29]\nAs discussed above, the respondent's position stems from a misplaced focus on the reason for the risk - the question is not whether the risk to a claimant is created by criminal activity, but rather whether the claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to his or her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and whether that risk is one not faced generally by other individuals in or from the country. If the Board fails to undertake an individualized inquiry to determine those questions the Court will have basis to intervene.\n[30]\nIn this case, the Board's decision can be upheld, but not for the reason that citizens of Mexico are at a general risk of violence from criminal activity - a section 97 claim could potentially succeed based on a risk from gang violence in Mexico, depending on the circumstances. However, in this case the applicants' circumstances were considered, and the Board reasonably concluded that they faced no more than a risk faced generally by others in Mexico. The application is therefore dismissed.\n[31]\nNo questions were proposed for certification and none arise.\nJUDGMENT\n[32]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application is dismissed. No question has been proposed for certification.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/vnh\nANNEX A\nPerson in need of protection\n97.

  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nRennie, J.\n: This decision arises from an application for judicial review of a March 23, 2011 decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) that found that the applicants were neither Convention (United Nations'\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] Can TS No 6) refugees under section 96 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (\nIRPA\n) nor persons in need of protection under section 97 of the\nIRPA\n.\n\n[2]\nThe issue before this Court is whether the Board erred in its analysis under section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the\nIRPA\n. A second issue arises from the Board's findings on state protection; however, as the Board reasonably concluded that the applicants would not be subject to a risk not faced generally by other individuals in Mexico, the state protection issue need not be addressed. The third ground of review, breach of the principles of natural justice, was abandoned by the applicants at the outset of argument.\nFacts\n\n[3]\nThe principal applicant, Javier Camargo Vivero (applicant), his spouse and their minor child are originally from Cordoba, Veracruz, Mexico. The applicant was a self-employed auto-mechanic and his wife a self-employed graphic designer. On November 12, 2008, he was kidnapped, assaulted and held for a one million peso ransom by 'Los Zetas' (Zetas), a criminal gang in Mexico. His wife raised almost half of that in order to secure his release. The applicant was then instructed by the Zetas to pay 20,000 pesos each month in order to prevent harm to himself, his wife and child. He was told not to go to the police. He was told that his telephone would be monitored. He was told that he would be watched. He testified that both he and his home were, on occasion, under surveillance.\n\n[4]\nThe applicant spoke about the situation with some of his clients who were police officers. He was told by these officers that nothing could be done but to pay the ransom or close his business and move away. He thus did not report the kidnapping, the assault or the extortion threats to the police. By July 2009, the Zetas had increased the monthly extortionary rate to 25,000 pesos. The applicant testified that he thought of moving to another part of Mexico, but feared reprisals from the Zetas for closing his business and avoiding them. In the early hours of January 15, 2010, the applicants left their home, most of their possessions and drove to the airport. They arrived in Canada and made a claim for refugee status that day.\n\n[5]\nThe Board refused the claims on March 23, 2011, the same day as the hearing, and rendered its written decision on April 11, 2011, finding that:\n....there is no nexus to a Convention ground. That is to say, you do not fear the Los Zetas criminal gang on the basis of your nationality or your race or your religion or your political opinion. I do not find that you are members of a particular social group in terms of your fear of Los Zetas. You are victims of kidnapping, assault, death threats and extortion. In other words, you are victims of crime in Mexico. Victimization alone cannot form the basis of your membership in a particular social group. I am not of the view the principal claimant's status as a successful businessman in Mexico forms the basis of a particular social group.\n\n[6]\nThe Board further developed this finding, and added that:\nThere was no evidence before me demonstrating that you were targeted by Los Zetas for any reason other than your perceived wealth. The Zetas were looking for anyone who could pay them. The motivation to target you was purely financial, with your perceived wealth being the probable cause. As such, your fear results from criminality which does not constitute a fear of persecution based on a Convention ground as was found in the cases of\nLarenas\nand\nVikram\n...\n\n[7]\nHaving concluded that a claim under section 96 had not been established, the Board then considered whether the criteria of section 97 of the\nIRPA\nhad been satisfied. The Board stated:\n...I must assess your claims under subsection 97(1) of the Act on a balance of probabilities. I note that there is no evidence of continued threat or risk from these particular gang members. While you believe there would be serious consequences if Los Zetas found you in Mexico, there is no evidence that they continue to actively search for you. This confirms my conclusion that their main interest in you was money. While I accept that you continue to fear those who kidnapped and extorted you, I find that the risk you face is unfortunately a generalized one. In a country in which there is a high crime rate, that undermines the security of all citizens.\nThe particular facts of the claimant must be distinguished in order to satisfy the requirements of section 97(1) of the Act. In other words, you must face a more personalized risk than other Mexicans, including other small business owners and families.\nEven if I found that your perceived wealth placed you at a higher risk than lower income individuals, your case is still not made out. [Emphasis added]\n\n[8]\nAfter also finding that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, the Board concluded that the applicants did not fall within the scope of section 97 of the\nIRPA\n.\nOverview\n\n[9]\nThe issue before the Court was whether there is a divergence in the jurisprudence with respect to section 97, as set forth in Annex A to this Judgment.\n\n[10]\nThe thrust of the applicant's argument was that there were two lines of divergent authority with respect to section 97(1)(b)(ii) and the ambit or extent of the proviso that the risk \"... is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\" It was argued that certain decisions hold that acts of ordinary criminality can satisfy the second part of the test, and that under a second line of authority, acts of criminality cannot satisfy the test.\n\n[11]\nIn my view, there is no divergence in the jurisprudence; rather differences in the outcomes of section 97 cases stem from the need for an individualized inquiry in each case. In every instance, the Board must determine if all the requirements of section 97 are met, which includes a determination of whether the claimant would personally face a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment,\nand\nwhether that risk is faced generally by other individuals in or from that country. It is therefore an error to fail to consider whether the claimant faces a personalized risk, or to conflate that question with whether the risk is a general risk. It is also an error to conflate the risk with the reason for it; thus, the fact that the risk arises from criminal activity is not itself relevant to the question of whether the requirements of section 97 are met.\n\n[12]\nIn this case, however, the Board did conduct an individualized inquiry and found that the applicants were not subject to a risk that was not faced generally by other individuals in Mexico. This conclusion was reasonably open to the Board, and the application must therefore be dismissed.\nAnalysis\n\n[13]\nIn many decisions of this Court, the Court has upheld findings that claimants faced only a general risk faced by other individuals in their country. For example, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice John O'Keefe held at paragraph 25:\nThe applicants are members of a large group of people who may be targeted for economic crimes in Honduras on the basis of their perceived wealth. The applicants submitted that the Board erred in imposing too high a standard upon them in requiring that they prove that they would be personally at risk. Given the wording of subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of IRPA, the applicants had to satisfy the Board that they would be personally subjected to a risk that was not generally faced by others in Honduras.\n\n[14] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was favourably cited shortly thereafter by Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where she held at paragraph 23:\nBased on the recent jurisprudence of this Court, I am of the view that the applicant does not face a personalized risk that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from Haiti. The risk of all forms of criminality is general and felt by all Haitians. While a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, all Haitians are at risk of becoming the victims of violence.\n\n[15]\nThis Court would also follow this line of reasoning in cases such as\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . A passage from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is particularly instructive. Justice Johanne Gauthier (now of the Court of Appeal) wrote at paragraph 16:\nThe applicant referred to a passage of the documentary evidence which confirms that bus fare collectors are frequently subject to extortion by the Gang. However, the Board examined this country documentation and found it to clearly indicate the prevalence of gang related violence in a variety of sectors. It is no more unreasonable to find that a particular group that is targeted, be it bus fare collectors or other victims of extortion and who do not pay, faces generalised violence than to reach the same conclusion in respect of well known wealthy business men in Haiti who were clearly found to be at a heightened risk of facing the violence prevalent in that country.\n\n[16]\nThe genesis of what was argued to be an alternative approach to section 97(1)(b)(ii) lies in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, the applicant had been threatened by armed members of the Maras Salvatruchas on several occasions, both at his home and at university. In setting aside the decision Justice Yves de Montigny wrote at paragraphs 13 and 15:\nIn short, the risk faced by an applicant ought not to be a random and generalized risk indiscriminately faced by all persons living in the country to which the applicant risks to be removed. In this case, the applicant submitted in his Personal Information Form (PIF) that he had been personally subjected to danger; yet the RPD did not take this into account and rather put the accent on the fact that Mr. Pineda had stated in his testimony that the Maras Salvatruchas recruited across the country and targeted all levels of society, regardless of the age of the persons contemplated.\n[...]\nUnder these circumstances, the RPD's finding is patently unreasonable. It cannot be accepted, by implication at least, that the applicant had been threatened by a well-organized gang that was terrorizing the entire country, according to the documentary evidence, and in the same breath surmise that this same applicant would not be exposed to a personal risk if he were to return to El Salvador. It could very well be that the Maras Salvatruchas recruit from the general population; the fact remains that Mr. Pineda, if his testimony is to be believed, had been specifically targeted and was subjected to repeated threats and attacks. On that basis, he was subjected to a greater risk than the risk faced by the population in general.\n\n[17]\nIn the subsequent decision of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Eleanor Dawson, (now of the Court of Appeal) analyzed section 97(1)(b)(ii) and its underlying objectives. Justice Dawson noted that the concept embedded in section 97(1)(b)(ii) was not new, but had its antecedence in the\nImmigration Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c-2 and the Regulations which required a claimant to establish \"an objectively identifiable risk, which risk would apply in every part of that country and would not be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\" Justice Dawson turned next, at paragraph 17, to the guidelines published by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration which informed the interpretation of various elements contained in the definition of the post-determination refugee claimants in Canada (PDRCC) class:\nThe Department of Citizenship and Immigration published guidelines to assist officers in the interpretation of the various elements contained in the definition of the PDRCC class. With respect to the requirement that the risk \"would not be faced generally by other individuals\" the guidelines instructed officers that:\nThe threat is not restricted to a risk personalized to an individual; it includes risks faced by individuals that may be shared by others who are similarly situated\n. Neither are risks restricted by ethnic, political, religious or social factors as the concept of persecution is in the Convention refugee definition. Whether or not the risk is associated with a \"Convention\" ground, a person may fall within the scope of this definition. Notwithstanding this, the limitation imposed by the PDRCC definition in the phrase \"which risk ... would not be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country\" applies.\nAny risk that would apply to all residents or citizens of the country of origin cannot result in a positive decision under this Regulation\n. [emphasis added]\n[Emphasis in original]\n\n[18]\nJustice Dawson concluded that the Board must consider whether the risk is faced generally by all other persons living in the country.\n\n[19]\nA decade earlier, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Donna McGillis also referred to the guidelines, at paragraph 37, to help articulate the scope of the requirement under what is now section 97(1)(b)(ii):\nIn particular, the PDRCC class guidelines emphasize that the criteria in subsection 2(1) of the Regulations are not only restricted to \"a risk personalized to an individual\", but also include a risk faced by others similarly situated. Furthermore, the guidelines interpret the exclusionary phrase in the Regulations that the risk must not be \"faced generally by other individuals\", as meaning a risk faced by all residents or citizens of that country. Indeed, during his cross-examination, Gilbert Troutet, a specialist in PDRCC class applications, stated that the exclusion would apply only \"in extreme situations such as a generalized disaster of some sort that would involve all of the inhabitants of a given country. And if such a situation does occur, the [respondent] has specific programs to cover such situations.\" [Footnote omitted]\n\n[20]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Simon Noël found at paragraph 17 that the Board erred by failing to consider whether the risk faced by the applicant was different from the general risk created by ordinary criminal activity:\nAs was the case in\nMartinez Pineda\n, the Board erred in its decision: it focused on the generalized threat suffered by the population of Guatemala while failing to consider the Applicant's particular situation.

When one conflates the reason for the risk with the risk itself, one fails to properly conduct the individualized inquiry of the claim that is essential to a proper s. 97 analysis and determination.\n\n[24]\nThe respondent asserts that a risk of violence from criminal activity is a risk faced generally by individuals in Mexico and therefore cannot support a section 97 claim. However,\nCorado  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , holds that position to be contrary to the requirement of an individualized inquiry in each case, and to the line of cases to which I have referred finding a personal risk arising from criminal gang activity:\nMartinez Pineda\n;\nAguilar Zacarias\n;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[25]\nI agree with the reasons of Justice Zinn quoted in the paragraphs above.

These findings were specific to the applicants' circumstances, and they were reasonably open to the Board. The Court therefore has no basis to intervene.\nConclusion\n\n[28]\nIt must be remembered that Parliament is presumed not to have enacted legislation that is devoid of content; thus, the interpretation of section 97 frequently relied on by the Refugee Protection Division cannot be supported: for example, it would not protect individuals from natural disasters, as natural disasters affect everyone; it would not protect individuals from criminal acts, as all are at risk of extortion. Section 97 would thus be reduced, in its application, to the protection of individuals who are victimized by criminal acts in countries where the risk of criminality is not widespread or prevalent. In these cases, state protection, logically, is likely to be available. In consequence, section 97 would be stripped of any content and bereft of meaning, a legislative section in search of meaning.\n\n[29]\nAs discussed above, the respondent's position stems from a misplaced focus on the reason for the risk - the question is not whether the risk to a claimant is created by criminal activity, but rather whether the claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to his or her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and whether that risk is one not faced generally by other individuals in or from the country. If the Board fails to undertake an individualized inquiry to determine those questions the Court will have basis to intervene.\n\n[30]\nIn this case, the Board's decision can be upheld, but not for the reason that citizens of Mexico are at a general risk of violence from criminal activity - a section 97 claim could potentially succeed based on a risk from gang violence in Mexico, depending on the circumstances. However, in this case the applicants' circumstances were considered, and the Board reasonably concluded that they faced no more than a risk faced generally by others in Mexico. The application is therefore dismissed.\n\n[31]\nNo questions were proposed for certification and none arise.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[32]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application is dismissed. No question has been proposed for certification.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/vnh\nANNEX A\nPerson in need of protection\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nPerson in need of protection\n(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.\nPerson to protect\n97. (1) A person to be protected is a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\n(a) or at risk, if there are serious grounds for believing so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\nPerson to protect\n(2) A person who is in Canada and is part of a category of persons to whom the need for protection is recognized by regulation is also a person to be protected.",

      "Applicants, originally from Cordoba, Veracruz, Mexico, claimed refugee status in Canada.",

      "In November 2008, the principal applicant was kidnapped and assaulted by a criminal gang known as 'Los Zetas' who demanded a ransom.",
      "A ransom was paid, partially raised by the applicant’s wife, to secure his release.",
      "Following his release, the applicant was extorted by Los Zetas, required to pay a monthly fee to ensure the safety of himself, his wife, and child.",
      "The applicant was warned not to contact the police and believed he was under surveillance.",
      "The applicant discussed the situation with police officers who advised him that reporting the incidents would be ineffective and suggested relocating.",
      "The monthly extortion payments increased to 25,000 pesos by July 2009.",
      "Fearing reprisals, the applicant did not report the kidnapping, assault, or extortion threats to the authorities.",
      "In January 2010, the applicants left Mexico and arrived in Canada, claiming refugee status.",
      "The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) denied the applicants’ claims for refugee status and protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.",
      "The Board found that the applicants’ fear stemmed from being victims of crime, rather than persecution based on Convention grounds.",
      "The Board determined that the applicants did not face a risk beyond that faced by other individuals in Mexico."

        "There was no evidence of a continued threat or risk from the Zetas; they were not actively searching for the applicants.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) erred in its analysis of section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which concerns individuals in need of protection. The court found no divergence in jurisprudence regarding this section, asserting that differing outcomes stem from the necessity of an individualized inquiry in each case.",
      "The court clarified that the Board must determine if a claimant faces a *personalized* risk, distinct from a general risk faced by others in their country, and that conflating the reason for the risk (e.g., criminal activity) with the risk itself is an error. The existence of criminal activity alone does not disqualify a claim.",
      "The court reviewed prior cases and found a consistent thread: the requirement to assess whether the claimant faces a risk beyond that generally experienced by others in the country. Cases like *Larenas* and *Vikram* were cited as examples of correctly applying this principle.",
      "The court acknowledged a previous, potentially divergent approach highlighted in *Martinez Pineda*, which emphasized the importance of considering whether the applicant had been *personally* targeted. However, the court reconciled this with the prevailing jurisprudence, stating that *Aguilar Zacarias* requires consideration of both personal risk *and* whether that risk is not generally faced by others.",
      "The court emphasized that section 97 is not intended to protect individuals from risks faced by the entire population (e.g., natural disasters or widespread crime). It is meant for those facing a risk *beyond* the general population's exposure.",
      "In the present case, the court found the Board’s conclusion reasonable. The Board had determined the applicants faced no more than a general risk of violence in Mexico, based on the finding that the Zetas were not actively pursuing them and their motivation was purely financial. This individualized assessment was not found to be unreasonable.",
      "The court cautioned against imprecise language in Board decisions, noting that conflating 'generalized risk' with 'no personal risk' is an error. A personal risk must be established before assessing whether it is a general risk."
