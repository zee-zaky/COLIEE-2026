    "[1]\nJudge Boivin\n: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of Mario Marchand, manager of personal services at the Canada Revenue Agency (the Agency), dated January 15, 2009, to reject the applicant's request for relief in order to obtain the cancellation of penalties and interest for the late filing of his income tax return for the 2006 taxation year under subsection 152(4.2) of the\nIncome Tax Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the Act).",
    "[2]\nIn the present case, the plaintiff represents himself.\nFactual background",
    "[3]\nThe plaintiff, Rodin Lemerise, filed his income tax return for the 2006 taxation year late. He filed his return almost a year late, on April 14, 2008, while the filing deadline was April 30, 2007.",
    "[4]\nOn May 1, 2008, the Agency issued a notice of assessment for the year 2006 by which penalties and interest were imposed for the late filing of the applicant's income tax return.",
    "[5]\nOn June 2, 2008, the plaintiff made a first request for relief in order to obtain the cancellation of the amounts of $223.40 in penalties for late filing and $140.29 in interest on arrears dated January 2009. The plaintiff alleges that he suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and that this illness is the main cause of the late filing of his income tax return. and that this is a situation beyond his control.",
    "[6]\nOn September 5, 2008, the requester received the Agency's decision advising him that his request for relief had been denied.",
    "[7]\nOn October 24, 2008, the applicant requested a review of the Agency's decision dated September 5, 2008. As part of this request, a personal services officer at the Agency named Claude Gagnon was tasked with preparing a recommendation for his supervisor, Mario Marchand. Mr. Gagnon relied on the facts and evidence presented by the plaintiff including the\nInformation Circular IC07-1 - Taxpayer Relief Provisions\n(Circular IC07-1).",
    "[8]\nOn January 13, 2009, after examining all the documents presented by the applicant, Claude Gagnon recommended not canceling the penalty and interest covered by the applicant's request for relief.",
    "[9]\nOn January 15, 2009, Mario Marchand, representing the Minister, communicated to the applicant the refusal of his request, specifying that no exceptional circumstances had prevented the applicant from declaring his income within the prescribed deadlines.",
    "[10]\nThe applicant contests the decision of January 15, 2009.\nIssues in dispute",
    "[11]\nThe only question that arises in this case is whether the Minister exercised his discretion pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the Act in refusing the applicant's request for cancellation of interest and penalties.\nRelevant legislation",
    "[12]\nIncome Tax Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th supplement):\n220.\n(3.1) The Minister may, not later than the day that is ten calendar years after the end of the taxation year of a taxpayer or the fiscal year of a partnership or on application of the taxpayer or the partnership made on or before that day, waive all or part of an amount of penalty or interest otherwise payable by the taxpayer or partnership under this Act for that taxation year or fiscal year, or cancel it altogether or in part. Despite subsections 152(4) to (5), the Minister establishes the necessary assessments regarding the interest and penalties payable by the taxpayer or the partnership to take into account such cancellation.\n220.\n(3.1) The Minister may, on or before the day that is ten calendar years after the end of a taxation year of a taxpayer (or in the case of a partnership, a fiscal period of the partnership) or on application by the taxpayer or partnership on or before that day, waive or cancel all or any portion of any penalty or interest otherwise payable under this Act by the taxpayer or partnership in respect of that taxation year or fiscal period, and notwithstanding subsections 152(4) to (5), any assessment of the interest and penalties payable by the taxpayer or partnership shall be made that is necessary to take into account the cancellation of the penalty or interest.\n152.\n(4.2) Despite subsections (4), (4.1) and (5), to determine, at a particular time after the end of the normal reassessment period applicable to a taxpayer - individual, other than a trust, or testamentary trust - for a taxation year the refund to which the taxpayer is entitled at that time for the year or the reduction of an amount payable by the taxpayer for the year under this Part, the Minister may, if the taxpayer requests such a determination at most late on the day ten calendar years following the end of that taxation year, both:\nhas\n) reassess the tax, interest or penalties payable by the taxpayer for the year under this Part;\n(b) redetermine the tax that is deemed, by subsection 120(2) or (2.2), 122.5(3), 122.51(2), 122.7(2) or (3), 127.1(1), 127.41(3) or 210.2(3) or (4), to have been paid on account of the tax payable by the taxpayer under this Part for the year or that is deemed, by subsection 122.61(1), to be an overpayment in respect of amounts owed by the taxpayer under this Part for the year.\n152.\n(4.2) Notwithstanding subsections (4), (4.1) and (5), for the purpose of determining, at any time after the end of the normal reassessment period of a taxpayer who is an individual (other than a trust) or a testamentary trust in respect of a taxation year, the amount of any refund to which the taxpayer is entitled at that time for the year, or a reduction of an amount payable under this Part by the taxpayer for the year, the Minister may, if the taxpayer makes an application for that determination on or before the day that is ten calendar years after the end of that taxation year,\n(\nhas\n) reassess tax, interest or penalties payable under this Part by the taxpayer in respect of that year; and\n(\nb\n) redetermine the amount, if any, deemed by subsection 120(2) or (2.2), 122.5(3), 122.51(2), 122.7(2) or (3), 127.1(1), 127.41(3) or 210.2(3) or (4) to be paid on account of the taxpayer's tax payable under this Part for the year or deemed by subsection 122.61(1) to be an overpayment on account of the taxpayer's liability under this Part for the year.\nControl standard",
    "[13]\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has determined that the standard of review applicable to the Minister's discretionary decision under the fairness provisions of the Act is reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> N.R. 348 and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> N.R. 141).\nAnalysis",
    "[14]\nAccording to the applicant, the minister's refusal shows that he did not understand what ADHD is. The plaintiff explains his repeated lateness in previous years to ADHD rather than negligence or carelessness, because a person with ADHD constantly repeats the same mistakes. This explains that the plaintiff has been able to lead a very responsible professional life and is not a negligent or careless individual. The plaintiff alleges that neither his testimony nor his doctor's diagnosis were taken seriously by the minister. According to his claims, the minister made his decision based on the applicant's previous failings and neglecting his medical condition.",
    "[15]\nThe applicable rules for taxpayer relief are contained in the guidelines in Circular IC07-1. These guidelines do not have the force of law and cannot hinder the exercise of its discretionary power (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 380 at paras. 16-17), but they can facilitate the exercise of this discretion.",
    "[16]\nUnder section 23 of the guidelines, the Minister may grant relief from the application of penalties and interest when certain situations are present and they justify the taxpayer's inability to fulfill their obligations. Among the situations listed, we find exceptional circumstances.",
    "[17]\nFor its part, section 25 of the guidelines specifies that a serious illness or serious accident may be among the exceptional circumstances which may have prevented a taxpayer from fulfilling their obligations under the Act, in particular filing a return on time.",
    "[18]\nIn the present case, the plaintiff cited illness as a reason to support his request for relief. He explained that he suffered from ADHD.",
    "[19]\nIn order to obtain a reduction or cancellation of penalties and interest, the applicant provided information to support his or her request, as required by the guidelines. Based on the information provided, the Minister had to consider whether the applicant's ADHD illness represented circumstances beyond the applicant's control and, if so, whether those circumstances prevented or could prevent the applicant from complying with the Act.",
    "[20]\nIn support of his request, the applicant submitted a note from Dr. Bernard Lafrenière dated April 8, 2008. The difficulty for the applicant lies in the fact that this letter does not explain how his state of health would have prevented him, under exceptional circumstances (art. 23 and 25 of the guidelines) from submitting his 2006 income tax return within the time limits prescribed by the Law. Indeed, the information contained in the letter is, all in all, quite limited. For example, (i) the letter does not mention the dosage recommended to the applicant by the doctor (ii) it does not explain the consequences of the medication on the applicant (iii) it does not indicate how long the applicant has been under medication (iv) it is silent as to the applicant's state of health in general - that is to say what are the reasons that could explain that the applicant performs well in certain spheres of activity and less in others and, (v) in what way medication may cause difficulties for the applicant when it comes time to carry out certain tasks, in particular filing their annual tax return. In light of this note provided by the applicant, the Court is of the opinion that it was difficult for the Minister to conclude that the applicant cannot file his income tax returns within the time limits prescribed by the Act.",
    "[21]\nFurthermore, the decision of September 5, 2008 recalls that several of the applicant's previous income tax returns, namely those corresponding to the years 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2004, had been produced after the deadline. due date. The Court notes that among the factors used to arrive at his decision, the Minister may consider whether the taxpayer has respected his tax obligations in the past (art. 33 of the guidelines).",
    "[22]\nThe letter of September 5, 2008, read\nconversely\n, is also to the effect that between 1998 and 2003 as well as in 2005 the applicant demonstrated that he was able to file his declarations on time.",
    "[23]\nSection 32 of the Guidelines places the burden on the applicant to provide the Agency with all relevant information in support of its request for relief. It is in fact well established that a taxpayer who invokes his state of health in support of a request for relief from penalties or interest has the burden of proving that his illness or state of health constitute factors beyond his control and that the interest due arises mainly from these factors (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 447 at para. 19 (C.F.P.I). The burden of proof therefore fell on the applicant and not on the Agency.",
    "[24]\nThe Court does not have to decide whether the Minister was right or wrong, but rather whether he considered all the evidence before him fairly in order to determine whether the applicant's failure to comply with the Act was caused by factors beyond his control. The question is not whether the Court would have made a different decision, but rather whether the Minister's decision was reasonable given the applicant's evidence to support his claim.",
    "[25]\nFinally, the plaintiff argued that he had three (3) years to file his tax return. The Court disagrees. Indeed, under section 150 of the Act, an income tax return must be filed for each taxation year of a taxpayer. The three (3) year limitation period provided for in Article 64 of the Guidelines to which the plaintiff refers applies instead in the case of a tax refund, which does not correspond to the facts in this case.",
    "[26]\nAfter reviewing the file and hearing the parties, the Court is satisfied that the Minister exercised his discretionary power in good faith and in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The Court concludes that the Minister considered the evidence presented before him and that the decision was not based on considerations that were inappropriate or extraneous to the purpose of the Act (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in par. 8).",
    "[27]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed. In the exercise of the Court's discretion, there will be no costs.\nJUDGEMENT",

(la Loi).\n[2]\nDans la présente affaire, le demandeur se représente seul.\nContexte factuel\n[3]\nLe demandeur, Rodin Lemerise, a produit tardivement sa déclaration de revenus pour l'année d'imposition 2006. Il a produit sa déclaration avec près d'une année en retard, soit le 14 avril 2008, alors que la date limite de production était le 30 avril 2007.\n[4]\nLe 1 mai 2008, l'Agence a émis un avis de cotisation pour l'année 2006 par lequel des pénalités et des intérêts ont été imposés pour la production tardive de la déclaration de revenus du demandeur.\n[5]\nLe 2 juin 2008, le demandeur a fait une première demande d'allègement afin d'obtenir l'annulation des montants de 223,40 $ en pénalité pour production tardive et de 140,29 $ d'intérêts sur arriérés en date de janvier 2009. Le demandeur allègue qu'il est atteint du trouble de déficit de l'attention et hyperactivité (TDAH) et que cette maladie est la cause principale de la production tardive de sa déclaration de revenus et qu'il s'agit d'une situation hors de son contrôle.\n[6]\nLe 5 septembre 2008, le demandeur a reçu la décision de l'Agence l'avisant que sa demande d'allègement avait été refusée.\n[7]\nLe 24 octobre 2008, le demandeur a demandé un réexamen de la décision de l'Agence datée du 5 septembre 2008. Dans le cadre de cette demande, un agent du service aux particuliers à l'Agence nommé Claude Gagnon a été chargé de préparer une recommandation pour son superviseur, Mario Marchand. M. Gagnon s'est appuyé sur les faits et la preuve présentés par le demandeur incluant la\nCirculaire d'information IC07-1 - Dispositions d'allègement pour les contribuables\n(Circulaire IC07-1).\n[8]\nLe 13 janvier 2009, après avoir examiné l'ensemble des documents présentés par le demandeur, Claude Gagnon a recommandé de ne pas annuler la pénalité et les intérêts visés par la demande d'allègement du demandeur.\n[9]\nLe 15 janvier 2009, Mario Marchand, représentant le ministre, a communiqué au demandeur le refus de sa demande, précisant qu'aucune circonstance exceptionnelle n'avait empêché le demandeur de déclarer ses revenus dans les délais prescrits.\n[10]\nLe demandeur conteste la décision du 15 janvier 2009.\nQuestions en litige\n[11]\nLa seule question qui se pose en l'espèce est de savoir si le ministre a exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire conformément au paragraphe 220(3.1) de la Loi en refusant la demande d'annulation des intérêts et pénalités du demandeur.\nLégislation pertinente\n[12]\nLoi de l'impôt sur le revenu\n, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 1 (5e suppl.):\n220.\n(3.1) Le ministre peut, au plus tard le jour qui suit de dix années civiles la fin de l'année d'imposition d'un contribuable ou de l'exercice d'une société de personnes ou sur demande du contribuable ou de la société de personnes faite au plus tard ce jour-là, renoncer à tout ou partie d'un montant de pénalité ou d'intérêts payable par ailleurs par le contribuable ou la société de personnes en application de la présente loi pour cette année d'imposition ou cet exercice, ou l'annuler en tout ou en partie. Malgré les paragraphes 152(4) à (5), le ministre établit les cotisations voulues concernant les intérêts et pénalités payables par le contribuable ou la société de personnes pour tenir compte de pareille annulation.\n220.\n(3.1) The Minister may, on or before the day that is ten calendar years after the end of a taxation year of a taxpayer (or in the case of a partnership, a fiscal period of the partnership) or on application by the taxpayer or partnership on or before that day, waive or cancel all or any portion of any penalty or interest otherwise payable under this Act by the taxpayer or partnership in respect of that taxation year or fiscal period, and notwithstanding subsections 152(4) to (5), any assessment of the interest and penalties payable by the taxpayer or partnership shall be made that is necessary to take into account the cancellation of the penalty or interest.\n152.\n(4.2) Malgré les paragraphes (4), (4.1) et (5), pour déterminer, à un moment donné après la fin de la période normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable à un contribuable - particulier, autre qu'une fiducie, ou fiducie testamentaire - pour une année d'imposition le remboursement auquel le contribuable a droit à ce moment pour l'année ou la réduction d'un montant payable par le contribuable pour l'année en vertu de la présente partie, le ministre peut, si le contribuable demande pareille détermination au plus tard le jour qui suit de dix années civiles la fin de cette année d'imposition, à la fois:\na\n) établir de nouvelles cotisations concernant l'impôt, les intérêts ou les pénalités payables par le contribuable pour l'année en vertu de la présente partie;\nb) déterminer de nouveau l'impôt qui est réputé, par les paragraphes 120(2) ou (2.2), 122.5(3), 122.51(2), 122.7(2) ou (3), 127.1(1), 127.41(3) ou 210.2(3) ou (4), avoir été payé au titre de l'impôt payable par le contribuable en vertu de la présente partie pour l'année ou qui est réputé, par le paragraphe 122.61(1), être un paiement en trop au titre des sommes dont le contribuable est redevable en vertu de la présente partie pour l'année.\n152.\n(4.2) Notwithstanding subsections (4), (4.1) and (5), for the purpose of determining, at any time after the end of the normal reassessment period of a taxpayer who is an individual (other than a trust) or a testamentary trust in respect of a taxation year, the amount of any refund to which the taxpayer is entitled at that time for the year, or a reduction of an amount payable under this Part by the taxpayer for the year, the Minister may, if the taxpayer makes an application for that determination on or before the day that is ten calendar years after the end of that taxation year,\n(\na\n) reassess tax, interest or penalties payable under this Part by the taxpayer in respect of that year; and\n(\nb\n) redetermine the amount, if any, deemed by subsection 120(2) or (2.2), 122.5(3), 122.51(2), 122.7(2) or (3), 127.1(1), 127.41(3) or 210.2(3) or (4) to be paid on account of the taxpayer's tax payable under this Part for the year or deemed by subsection 122.61(1) to be an overpayment on account of the taxpayer's liability under this Part for the year.\nNorme de contrôle\n[13]\nLa Cour d'appel fédérale a déterminé que la norme de contrôle applicable à la décision discrétionnaire du ministre en vertu des dispositions d'équité de la Loi est la raisonnabilité (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 348 et\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 141).\nAnalyse\n[14]\nSelon le demandeur, le refus du ministre démontre qu'il n'a pas compris ce qu'est le TDAH. Le demandeur explique ses retards répétés dans les années antérieures par le TDAH plutôt que par la négligence ou l'insouciance, car une personne atteinte du TDAH répète constamment les mêmes erreurs. Ceci explique que le demandeur a pu mener une vie professionnelle très responsable et qu'il n'est pas un individu négligent ou insouciant. Le demandeur allègue que ni son témoignage ni le diagnostique de son médecin n'ont été pris au sérieux par le ministre. Selon ses prétentions, le ministre a rendu sa décision en vertu des manquements antérieurs du demandeur et en négligeant sa condition médicale.\n[15]\nLes règles applicables en matière d'allègement pour les contribuables sont contenues dans les lignes directrices de la Circulaire IC07-1. Ces lignes directrices n'ont pas force de loi et ne peuvent pas entraver l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 380 aux par. 16-17), mais elles peuvent faciliter l'exercice de cette discrétion.\n[16]\nEn vertu de l'article 23 des lignes directrices, le ministre peut accorder un allègement de l'application des pénalités et des intérêts lorsque certaines situations sont présentes et qu'elles justifient l'incapacité du contribuable à s'acquitter de ses obligations. Parmi les situations énumérées, on retrouve des  circonstances exceptionnelles .\n[17]\nPour sa part, l'article 25 des lignes directrices précise qu'une maladie grave ou un accident grave peut compter parmi des  circonstances exceptionnelles  qui peuvent avoir empêché un contribuable de s'acquitter de ses obligations en vertu de la Loi, notamment produire une déclaration dans les délais.\n[18]\nDans la présente cause, le demandeur a invoqué la maladie à titre de motif à l'appui de sa demande d'allègement. Il a expliqué qu'il souffrait du TDAH.\n[19]\nAfin d'obtenir une réduction ou l'annulation des pénalités et intérêts, le demandeur a fourni des renseignements à l'appui de sa demande, tel qu'exigé par les lignes directrices. Sur la base des renseignements fournis, le ministre devait se demander si la maladie TDAH du demandeur représentait des circonstances indépendantes de la volonté du demandeur et, le cas échéant, si ces circonstances empêchaient ou pourraient empêcher le demandeur de se conformer à la Loi.\n[20]\nA l'appui de sa demande, le demandeur a soumis une note du Dr Bernard Lafrenière datée du 8 avril 2008. La difficulté pour le demandeur réside dans le fait que cette lettre n'explique pas en quoi son état de santé l'aurait empêché, à titre de  circonstances exceptionnelles  (art. 23 et 25 des lignes directrices) de soumettre sa déclaration de revenu de 2006 dans les délais prescrits par la Loi. En effet, les renseignements contenus dans la lettre sont, somme toute, assez limités. A titre d'exemple, (i) la lettre ne mentionne pas la posologie conseillée au demandeur par le médecin (ii) elle n'explique pas les conséquences de la médication sur le demandeur (iii) elle n'indique pas depuis combien de temps le demandeur est sous médication (iv) elle est silencieuse quant à l'état de santé du demandeur en général - c'est-à-dire quelles sont les raisons pouvant expliquer que le demandeur est performant dans certaines sphères d'activités et moins dans d'autres et, (v) de quelle façon la médication peut entraîner des difficultés pour le demandeur lorsque vient le temps d'effectuer certaines tâches, notamment produire sa déclaration annuelle d'impôt. A la lumière de cette note fournie par le demandeur, la Cour est d'avis qu'il était difficile pour le ministre de conclure que le demandeur ne peut produire ses déclarations de revenu dans les délais prescrits par la Loi.\n[21]\nAu surplus, la décision du 5 septembre 2008 rappelle que plusieurs des déclarations de revenus antérieures du demandeur, soient celles correspondant aux années 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 et 2004, avaient été produites après le délai d'échéance. La Cour note que parmi les facteurs utilisés pour arriver à sa décision, le ministre peut considérer si le contribuable a respecté par le passé ses obligations fiscales (art. 33 des lignes directrices).\n[22]\nLa lettre du 5 septembre 2008, lu\na contrario\n, est également à l'effet qu'entre 1998 et 2003 ainsi qu'en 2005 le demandeur a démontré qu'il était en mesure de produire ses déclarations dans les délais.\n[23]\nL'article 32 des lignes directrices impose au demandeur le fardeau de fournir à l'Agence tous les renseignements pertinents à l'appui de sa demande d'allègement. Il est en effet bien établi qu'un contribuable qui invoque son état de santé au soutien d'une demande d'allègement des pénalités ou intérêts a le fardeau de prouver que sa maladie ou son état de santé constituent des facteurs indépendants de sa volonté et que les intérêts dus découlent principalement de ces facteurs (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 447 au par. 19 (C.F.P.I). Le fardeau de preuve incombait donc au demandeur et non pas à l'Agence.\n[24]\nLa Cour n'a pas à décider si le ministre a eu raison ou tort, mais plutôt s'il a considéré toute la preuve devant lui de façon équitable de manière à déterminer si l'omission du demandeur de se conformer à la Loi a été causée par des facteurs indépendants de sa volonté. La question n'est pas de savoir si la Cour aurait rendu une décision différente, mais plutôt de savoir si la décision du ministre était raisonnable compte tenu de la preuve du demandeur pour appuyer sa prétention.\n[25]\nFinalement, le demandeur a avancé qu'il disposait d'un délai de trois (3) ans pour produire sa déclaration d'impôt. La Cour est en désaccord. En effet, en vertu de l'article 150 de la Loi, une déclaration de revenu doit être produite pour chaque année d'imposition d'un contribuable. Le délai de trois (3) ans de prescription prévu à l'article 64 des lignes directrices auquel fait référence le demandeur s'applique plutôt dans le cas d'un remboursement d'impôt, ce qui ne correspond pas aux faits en l'espèce.\n[26]\nAprès avoir pris connaissance du dossier et entendu les parties, la Cour est satisfaite que le ministre a exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire de bonne foi et en conformité avec les principes de justice naturelle. La Cour conclut que le ministre a examiné la preuve présentée devant lui et que la décision n'était pas fondée sur des considérations inappropriées ou étrangères à l'objet de la Loi (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au par. 8).\n[27]\nPour ces raisons, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Dans l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire de la Cour, il n'y aura pas de dépens.\nJUGEMENT\n[28]\nLA COUR ORDONNE ET ADJUGE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée sans dépens.\n[End of document]",

He filed his return almost a year late, on April 14, 2008, while the filing deadline was April 30, 2007.\n\n[4]\nOn May 1, 2008, the Agency issued a notice of assessment for the year 2006 by which penalties and interest were imposed for the late filing of the applicant's income tax return.\n\n[5]\nOn June 2, 2008, the plaintiff made a first request for relief in order to obtain the cancellation of the amounts of $223.40 in penalties for late filing and $140.29 in interest on arrears dated January 2009. The plaintiff alleges that he suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and that this illness is the main cause of the late filing of his income tax return. and that this is a situation beyond his control.\n\n[6]\nOn September 5, 2008, the requester received the Agency's decision advising him that his request for relief had been denied.\n\n[7]\nOn October 24, 2008, the applicant requested a review of the Agency's decision dated September 5, 2008. As part of this request, a personal services officer at the Agency named Claude Gagnon was tasked with preparing a recommendation for his supervisor, Mario Marchand. Mr. Gagnon relied on the facts and evidence presented by the plaintiff including the\nInformation Circular IC07-1 - Taxpayer Relief Provisions\n(Circular IC07-1).\n\n[8]\nOn January 13, 2009, after examining all the documents presented by the applicant, Claude Gagnon recommended not canceling the penalty and interest covered by the applicant's request for relief.\n\n[9]\nOn January 15, 2009, Mario Marchand, representing the Minister, communicated to the applicant the refusal of his request, specifying that no exceptional circumstances had prevented the applicant from declaring his income within the prescribed deadlines.\n\n[10]\nThe applicant contests the decision of January 15, 2009.\nIssues in dispute\n\n[11]\nThe only question that arises in this case is whether the Minister exercised his discretion pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the Act in refusing the applicant's request for cancellation of interest and penalties.\nRelevant legislation\n\n[12]\nIncome Tax Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th supplement):\n220.\n(3.1) The Minister may, not later than the day that is ten calendar years after the end of the taxation year of a taxpayer or the fiscal year of a partnership or on application of the taxpayer or the partnership made on or before that day, waive all or part of an amount of penalty or interest otherwise payable by the taxpayer or partnership under this Act for that taxation year or fiscal year, or cancel it altogether or in part. Despite subsections 152(4) to (5), the Minister establishes the necessary assessments regarding the interest and penalties payable by the taxpayer or the partnership to take into account such cancellation.\n220.\n(3.1) The Minister may, on or before the day that is ten calendar years after the end of a taxation year of a taxpayer (or in the case of a partnership, a fiscal period of the partnership) or on application by the taxpayer or partnership on or before that day, waive or cancel all or any portion of any penalty or interest otherwise payable under this Act by the taxpayer or partnership in respect of that taxation year or fiscal period, and notwithstanding subsections 152(4) to (5), any assessment of the interest and penalties payable by the taxpayer or partnership shall be made that is necessary to take into account the cancellation of the penalty or interest.\n152.\n(4.2) Despite subsections (4), (4.1) and (5), to determine, at a particular time after the end of the normal reassessment period applicable to a taxpayer - individual, other than a trust, or testamentary trust - for a taxation year the refund to which the taxpayer is entitled at that time for the year or the reduction of an amount payable by the taxpayer for the year under this Part, the Minister may, if the taxpayer requests such a determination at most late on the day ten calendar years following the end of that taxation year, both:\nhas\n) reassess the tax, interest or penalties payable by the taxpayer for the year under this Part;\n(b) redetermine the tax that is deemed, by subsection 120(2) or (2.2), 122.5(3), 122.51(2), 122.7(2) or (3), 127.1(1), 127.41(3) or 210.2(3) or (4), to have been paid on account of the tax payable by the taxpayer under this Part for the year or that is deemed, by subsection 122.61(1), to be an overpayment in respect of amounts owed by the taxpayer under this Part for the year.\n152.\n(4.2) Notwithstanding subsections (4), (4.1) and (5), for the purpose of determining, at any time after the end of the normal reassessment period of a taxpayer who is an individual (other than a trust) or a testamentary trust in respect of a taxation year, the amount of any refund to which the taxpayer is entitled at that time for the year, or a reduction of an amount payable under this Part by the taxpayer for the year, the Minister may, if the taxpayer makes an application for that determination on or before the day that is ten calendar years after the end of that taxation year,\n(\nhas\n) reassess tax, interest or penalties payable under this Part by the taxpayer in respect of that year; and\n(\nb\n) redetermine the amount, if any, deemed by subsection 120(2) or (2.2), 122.5(3), 122.51(2), 122.7(2) or (3), 127.1(1), 127.41(3) or 210.2(3) or (4) to be paid on account of the taxpayer's tax payable under this Part for the year or deemed by subsection 122.61(1) to be an overpayment on account of the taxpayer's liability under this Part for the year.\nControl standard\n\n[13]\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has determined that the standard of review applicable to the Minister's discretionary decision under the fairness provisions of the Act is reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> N.R. 348 and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> N.R. 141).\nAnalysis\n\n[14]\nAccording to the applicant, the minister's refusal shows that he did not understand what ADHD is. The plaintiff explains his repeated lateness in previous years to ADHD rather than negligence or carelessness, because a person with ADHD constantly repeats the same mistakes. This explains that the plaintiff has been able to lead a very responsible professional life and is not a negligent or careless individual. The plaintiff alleges that neither his testimony nor his doctor's diagnosis were taken seriously by the minister. According to his claims, the minister made his decision based on the applicant's previous failings and neglecting his medical condition.\n\n[15]\nThe applicable rules for taxpayer relief are contained in the guidelines in Circular IC07-1. These guidelines do not have the force of law and cannot hinder the exercise of its discretionary power (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 380 at paras. 16-17), but they can facilitate the exercise of this discretion.\n\n[16]\nUnder section 23 of the guidelines, the Minister may grant relief from the application of penalties and interest when certain situations are present and they justify the taxpayer's inability to fulfill their obligations. Among the situations listed, we find exceptional circumstances.\n\n[17]\nFor its part, section 25 of the guidelines specifies that a serious illness or serious accident may be among the exceptional circumstances which may have prevented a taxpayer from fulfilling their obligations under the Act, in particular filing a return on time.\n\n[18]\nIn the present case, the plaintiff cited illness as a reason to support his request for relief. He explained that he suffered from ADHD.\n\n[19]\nIn order to obtain a reduction or cancellation of penalties and interest, the applicant provided information to support his or her request, as required by the guidelines. Based on the information provided, the Minister had to consider whether the applicant's ADHD illness represented circumstances beyond the applicant's control and, if so, whether those circumstances prevented or could prevent the applicant from complying with the Act.\n\n[20]\nIn support of his request, the applicant submitted a note from Dr. Bernard Lafrenière dated April 8, 2008. The difficulty for the applicant lies in the fact that this letter does not explain how his state of health would have prevented him, under exceptional circumstances (art. 23 and 25 of the guidelines) from submitting his 2006 income tax return within the time limits prescribed by the Law. Indeed, the information contained in the letter is, all in all, quite limited. For example, (i) the letter does not mention the dosage recommended to the applicant by the doctor (ii) it does not explain the consequences of the medication on the applicant (iii) it does not indicate how long the applicant has been under medication (iv) it is silent as to the applicant's state of health in general - that is to say what are the reasons that could explain that the applicant performs well in certain spheres of activity and less in others and, (v) in what way medication may cause difficulties for the applicant when it comes time to carry out certain tasks, in particular filing their annual tax return. In light of this note provided by the applicant, the Court is of the opinion that it was difficult for the Minister to conclude that the applicant cannot file his income tax returns within the time limits prescribed by the Act.\n\n[21]\nFurthermore, the decision of September 5, 2008 recalls that several of the applicant's previous income tax returns, namely those corresponding to the years 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2004, had been produced after the deadline. due date. The Court notes that among the factors used to arrive at his decision, the Minister may consider whether the taxpayer has respected his tax obligations in the past (art. 33 of the guidelines).\n\n[22]\nThe letter of September 5, 2008, read\nconversely\n, is also to the effect that between 1998 and 2003 as well as in 2005 the applicant demonstrated that he was able to file his declarations on time.\n\n[23]\nSection 32 of the Guidelines places the burden on the applicant to provide the Agency with all relevant information in support of its request for relief. It is in fact well established that a taxpayer who invokes his state of health in support of a request for relief from penalties or interest has the burden of proving that his illness or state of health constitute factors beyond his control and that the interest due arises mainly from these factors (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A.C.W.S. (3d) 447 at para. 19 (C.F.P.I). The burden of proof therefore fell on the applicant and not on the Agency.\n\n[24]\nThe Court does not have to decide whether the Minister was right or wrong, but rather whether he considered all the evidence before him fairly in order to determine whether the applicant's failure to comply with the Act was caused by factors beyond his control. The question is not whether the Court would have made a different decision, but rather whether the Minister's decision was reasonable given the applicant's evidence to support his claim.\n\n[25]\nFinally, the plaintiff argued that he had three (3) years to file his tax return. The Court disagrees. Indeed, under section 150 of the Act, an income tax return must be filed for each taxation year of a taxpayer. The three (3) year limitation period provided for in Article 64 of the Guidelines to which the plaintiff refers applies instead in the case of a tax refund, which does not correspond to the facts in this case.\n\n[26]\nAfter reviewing the file and hearing the parties, the Court is satisfied that the Minister exercised his discretionary power in good faith and in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The Court concludes that the Minister considered the evidence presented before him and that the decision was not based on considerations that were inappropriate or extraneous to the purpose of the Act (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in par. 8).\n\n[27]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed. In the exercise of the Court's discretion, there will be no costs.\nJUDGEMENT\n\n[28]\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe application for judicial review be dismissed without costs.\n[End of document]",
