    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nvon Finckenstein, J.\nDecember 19, 2006.\nCounsel:\nMarc Boissonneault, for the applicant;\nDavid Tyndale, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nMarc Boissonneault, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicant;\nJohn H. Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nvon Finckenstein, J.\n: Djamel Bouaroudj (the Applicant) was born in 1969 in Algiers, Algeria. The Applicants parents and siblings reside in Algeria. He fears persecution in Algeria as a result of his perceived anti-government political opinion. He claims that this fear arose in 1991, when after serving two years of military service, he failed to report back to the Algerian army after being called to re-enlist. He states he did not report because he feared that he would be called on to suppress demonstrators in Algiers.",
    "[2]\nIn February 1991, army personnel came to his house to demand his whereabouts and behaved in a threatening manner towards his mother.",
    "[3]\nIn September 1993, he left Algeria. The Applicant arrived at Mirabel Airport in Quebec, entering the country with a French passport that was not his own. He immediately claimed refugee status under a false name. He feared that disclosure of his real name and passport would lead to deportation. He did not attend the hearing in March 1996, and he also failed to attend an abandonment hearing in June 1996. As a result, his refugee claim was declared abandoned. His application was refused in October 1996.",
    "[4]\nDuring the course of this process, the Applicant married a Canadian citizen in 1994. She applied to sponsor him for permanent residency. A sponsorship interview was held in 1997, but the application was rejected shortly thereafter. The marriage ended around this time.",
    "[5]\nIn late 1997, the Applicant received a letter directing him to leave Canada. He left Vancouver for Seattle, Washington. However, in October 1998, the Applicant returned to Canada at Niagara Falls.",
    "[6]\nHe once again applied for permanent residence status on the basis that he was a Convention Refugee. In October 2002, the Applicant attended an appointment where the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) informed him he was not eligible to have his claim determined by the Board because he had been found to have multiple identities. The Applicant filed for leave to appeal this decision at the Federal Court but was denied.",
    "[7]\nIn March 2004, the Applicant was convicted of fraud personation and use of credit cards obtained from crime. In July 2005, the Applicant received a negative Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA). Approximately two months later on September 20, 2005, his humanitarian and compassionate (H & C) application was refused. He is now seeking judicial review of that decision.\nISSUES",
    "[8]\nThe Applicant raises 2 issues:\n1. The Officer erred by:\na. Failing to consider his establishment;\nb. Making unjustified inferences about possible family support in Algeria; and\nc. Failing to consider hardship apart from risk.\n2. The Officer breached procedural fairness by not asking for additional representations or conducting an interview regarding the issue of family support in Algeria.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW",
    "[9]\nThe appropriate standard when reviewing an immigration officers H&C decision is reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). For a decision to be considered reasonable, there must be a line of analysis that could reasonably lead from the evidence to the Officers conclusion ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nANALYSIS\nIssue 1: Did the officer err in her factual finding re establishment, family support and risk?",
    "[10]\nThe Applicant argues that the Immigration Officer failed to give proper consideration to his long-time residence in Canada. The Applicant suggests that the Officers decision was based solely on the fact that he is single and childless and that he chose to reside in Canada while knowing that a removal order had been issued against him. The Applicant contends that if the Officer had taken account of the Applicants long-term residence in the country, it would have revealed that the Applicant was well-established in Canada. Furthermore, the Officer made the observation: He has his parents and several siblings in Algeria to whom he can return to and presumably offer some sort of support. However, the Applicant argues that there is no evidence that his family will support him. Finally, the Applicant argues that the Officer relied on the opinion from a PRRA Officer and did not make an independent assessment, as she should have, as to the hardship that the Applicant would face, aside from the risk assessed under a PRRA.",
    "[11]\nIn my view, these submissions cannot succeed. First, it should be noted that the face of the record does not support these allegations. A sentence of the decision reads, While I recognize the applicant has been away from his country for several years, it is my opinion that he has remained with the knowledge that he is under a removal order. The first clause suggests, contrary to the Applicants allegation, that the Officer has considered the Applicants level of establishment in Canada.",
    "[12]\nSecond, as to the Officers statement to the effect that the Applicant could presumably obtain some support from family in Algeria, this should be considered as an inference, not as an unsupported finding of fact. Such an inference is not unreasonable given that the Applicant has disclosed in his application that he has both parents and five siblings in Algeria. More importantly, the overall text does not suggest that this inference was a decisive factor in the Officers ultimate decision. A straightforward reading of the Officers decision does not reveal grounds for the Applicants allegations.",
    "[13]\nThirdly, there is no support in law for the Applicants position. The claimants level of establishment in Canada is not an independent consideration for the purposes of waiving s. 25(1) on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Instead, establishment in Canada is only one factor in the larger context of whether a claimant would face undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship upon being required to obtain a permanent residency visa from outside the country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 212 D.L.R. (4th) 139, Décary J.A. reviewed the ministerial guidelines for evaluating H & C factors, and emphasized that establishment in Canada is to be evaluated as a hardship factor only insofar as such establishment has arisen for reasons beyond a claimants control. He states at paragraph 27: [27] Paragraph 8.7 deals with the \"prolonged inability to leave Canada [having] led to establishment\". It states that:\nPositive consideration may be warranted when the applicant has been in Canada for a significant period of time due to\ncircumstances beyond his or her control\n. [Underlining in original.]",
    "[14]\nThe findings of the Officer and other immigration officials reveal that the Applicants residency in Canada was not due to circumstances beyond his control. Indeed, the record suggests that the only reason the Applicant has remained in the country for as long as he has is because of his repeated efforts to manipulate and abuse Canadas immigration procedures. If this is the case, it would be perverse indeed to reward such behaviour on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.",
    "[15]\nFinally, the contention that the Officer should have considered hardship in Algeria, other than risk determined under a PRRA, a sort of PRRA light, is without foundation. The H & C process is not a substitute immigration or refugee process. Rather an H & C application must be regarded in a larger context wherein the waiver of s. 25(1) on humanitarian and compassionate grounds is an exceptional judicial procedure that is not supposed to regularly supplant Canadas immigration rules.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), Shore J. stated this in an admirably concise manner when he wrote: [19] A decision made on H&C grounds is an exceptional measure and, moreover, a discretionary one. The existence of an H&C review offers an individual special and additional consideration for an exemption from Canadian immigration laws that are otherwise universally applied. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 457 (QL), at paragraph 15.)\n. . . . . [27] The officers determination that these facts together fail to demonstrate the exceptional circumstances of undue hardship was reasonable. The law is well established that granting an H&C is a rare exemption, granted only when applicants have demonstrated an unusual or excessive hardship",
    "[16]\nThere are no exceptional circumstances in the case before the Court that justifies the granting of an exemption from s. 25(1) on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The Applicant has shown nothing in the impugned decision or in the law to suggest otherwise.\nIssue 2: Did the Officer fail to observe the principles of procedural fairness?",
    "[17]\nThe Applicant claims that he was not given the opportunity of an interview with the Officer to discuss available family support in Algeria. The Applicant asserts that this denial amounted to a denial of procedural fairness.",
    "[18]\nThere is nothing in the Act or in the case law to suggest that the Applicant has a right to an interview with H & C officers. It is settled law that there is no right to an interview in this context. While common law rules of natural justice demand a right to be heard, this right does not require the granting of an interview, but instead simply requires that the Officer evaluate the relevant considerations in their entirety.",
    "[19]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), Wilson J. stated:\n34\nI agree that an oral hearing is not a general requirement for H & C decisions\n. An interview is not essential for the information relevant to an H & C application to be put before an immigration officer, so that the humanitarian and compassionate considerations presented may be considered in their entirety and in a fair manner  Taking all the factors relevant to determining the content of the duty of fairness into account, the lack of an oral hearing or notice of such a hearing did not, in my opinion, constitute a violation of the requirements of procedural fairness to which Ms. Baker was entitled in the circumstances, particularly given the fact that several of the factors point toward a more relaxed standard. The opportunity, which was accorded, for the appellant or her children to produce full and complete written documentation in relation to all aspects of her application satisfied the requirements of the participatory rights required by the duty of fairness in this case. [Underlining added.]",
    "[20]\nThis principle espoused in Baker appears to have become a well-established principle in the jurisprudence of this Court. For instance in Étienne v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1314 at para. 9, Pinard J. wrote:\n9 The case law of this Court is consistent that an interview is not required to ensure procedural fairness in processing applications for visa exemptions for humanitarian considerations (see, for example  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  procedural fairness argument also fails.\nORDER",

      "An individual born in Algeria in 1969 expressed fear of persecution due to perceived anti-government political opinions.",
      "The individual failed to report for re-enlistment in the Algerian army after completing initial military service in 1991, citing fear of suppressing demonstrations.",
      "Army personnel visited the individual’s family home in Algeria in February 1991 to inquire about his location.",
      "The individual left Algeria in September 1993 and entered Canada at Mirabel Airport using a French passport not his own.",
      "Upon entry into Canada, the individual immediately claimed refugee status under a false name.",
      "The initial refugee claim was abandoned due to non-attendance at scheduled hearings in 1996.",
      "The individual married a Canadian citizen in 1994, and a sponsorship application for permanent residency was subsequently rejected after an interview in 1997; the marriage later ended.",
      "The individual received a removal order in late 1997 and briefly left Canada for Seattle, Washington, before re-entering Canada at Niagara Falls in October 1998.",
      "A subsequent application for permanent residence based on refugee status was deemed ineligible in October 2002 due to the use of multiple identities.",
      "The individual was convicted of fraud, personation, and credit card offenses in March 2004.",
      "A Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) was negative in July 2005.",
      "A humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) application was refused in September 2005, and the individual sought judicial review of that decision."

      "Applicants": [
        "The Officer erred by failing to properly consider his long-time residence/establishment in Canada.",
        "The Officer’s decision was based solely on the Applicant being single and childless and choosing to remain in Canada despite a removal order, without fully considering his establishment.",
        "There is no evidence that his family in Algeria will *not* support him; the Officer made an unjustified inference about a lack of family support.",
        "The Officer relied on the PRRA Officer’s opinion without conducting an independent assessment of hardship beyond the assessed risk.",
        "The Officer should have considered hardship in Algeria beyond the risk assessed in the PRRA (a 'PRRA light').",
        "He was denied procedural fairness by not being given an interview to discuss family support in Algeria."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The Applicant’s residency in Canada was not due to circumstances beyond his control, but rather due to repeated attempts to manipulate Canada’s immigration procedures.",
        "The Officer *did* consider the Applicant’s length of residence in Canada.",
        "The Officer’s inference regarding potential family support in Algeria was reasonable given the Applicant’s disclosure of family members there.",
        "The H&C process is not a substitute for immigration or refugee processes; hardship must be considered in the larger context of waiving s. 25(1).",
        "There is no legal right to an interview with H&C officers; the duty of fairness is met by evaluating all relevant considerations, not necessarily by granting an interview."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court found the Immigration Officer’s decision to deny the Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) application was reasonable, adhering to the standard of reasonableness review. This meant there was a logical pathway from the evidence to the Officer’s conclusion.",
      "The court rejected the applicant’s argument that the Officer failed to adequately consider his length of residence in Canada, noting the decision explicitly acknowledged his years in the country but also recognized his awareness of the removal order. The court clarified that ‘establishment’ is only relevant as a hardship factor when arising from circumstances beyond the applicant’s control.",
      "The court referenced *Décary J.A.*’s analysis in *212 D.L.R. (4th) 139*, emphasizing that establishment is a hardship factor only when due to circumstances beyond the applicant’s control, and found the applicant’s residency was a result of attempts to manipulate Canada’s immigration system.",
      "The court upheld the Officer’s inference regarding potential family support in Algeria as reasonable, given the applicant’s disclosure of having parents and siblings there, and determined this inference wasn’t a decisive factor in the decision.",
      "The court dismissed the argument that the Officer should have conducted a separate hardship assessment in Algeria beyond the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA), stating the H&C process isn’t a substitute for refugee or immigration processes and is an exceptional measure.",
      "The court cited *Shore J.* in *[2002] F.C.J. No. 457* to reinforce that H&C grants are exceptional and discretionary, requiring demonstration of unusual or excessive hardship, which the applicant failed to demonstrate.",
      "The court determined the applicant had no legal right to an interview with the H&C officer, citing established jurisprudence. It emphasized that procedural fairness requires consideration of relevant factors, not necessarily an interview, referencing *Wilson J.*’s decision in *[1992] 1 F.C. 613* and *Pinard J.* in *Étienne v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1314*.",
      "The court found the Officer fulfilled the duty of fairness by evaluating all relevant considerations, even without an interview, and that the opportunity to submit written documentation was sufficient."
