    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nBlais, J.\nMay 4, 2007.\nCounsel:\nRichard Wazana, for the applicant;\nMichael Butterfield, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nRichard Wazana, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicant;\nJohn H. Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2007] F.T.R. TBEd. MY.016.",
    "[1]\nBlais, J.\n: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), for judicial review of a decision by a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer made on October 25, 2006, to refuse an application for protection.\nBACKGROUND",
    "[2]\nRoger George S. Rizk Hassaballa (the applicant) is a citizen of Egypt who came to Canada on December 10, 2003, after being denied asylum in the United States for lack of sufficient documentation, and made a claim for refugee protection immediately upon arriving in Canada.",
    "[3]\nOn February 11, 2004, the applicants claim for refugee protection was determined by the Refugee Protection Division (the RPD) to be abandoned, as a result of his failure to submit his Personal Information Form (PIF) on time. On March 2, 2004, the applicant filed an application to re-open his claim for refugee protection, which was denied, as was his application for judicial review of that decision (IMM-6813-04).",
    "[4]\nThe applicants claim to refugee protection was based on a well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of religion, for being a Coptic Christian. Specifically, the applicant claimed to have been attacked and beaten by a group of fundamentalist Muslims, members of the Gamaa Islamiya organization, and to have received telephone threats, all stemming from his friendship with a young Muslim woman who had expressed a strong interest in Christianity. The applicant also alleged that he was a person in need of protection based on a danger of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment, should he be forced to return to Egypt. Further, the applicant submitted that the government in Egypt was unwilling or unable to provide protection, and indeed tacitly condoned and often engaged in the persecution of Christians.",
    "[5]\nOn November 17, 2004, the applicant filed an application for protection under section 112 of the Act. Material in support of the PRRA was submitted by his counsel on December 8, 2004, and again on May 5, 2005.\nDECISION UNDER REVIEW",
    "[6]\nIn a decision made on October 25, 2006, the PRRA officer rejected the application, finding that, based on the evidence before her, there was no more than a mere possibility that the applicant would be subjected to persecution should he return to Egypt. The officer also concluded that there were no substantial grounds to believe that the applicant would face a risk of torture, nor were there reasonable grounds to believe that he would face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.",
    "[7]\nIn her detailed analysis, the PRRA officer did not question the applicants credibility with respect to his story of what happened to him ten years ago, but found no evidence to suggest that the people who allegedly harassed and physically injured him at that time would still be interested in him today. In any event, the officer noted that the applicant could always relocate to another region of Egypt if he was not comfortable returning to Alexandria where these events occurred. The PRRA officer also concluded that the discrimination suffered by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution and that the presumption of state protection had not been rebutted.\nISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION",
    "[8]\nThe following issues must be considered in this judicial review application:\n1) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that the discrimination faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution?\n2) Did the PRRA officer err in determining that state protection was available to the applicant?\n3) Did the PRRA officer err by rendering a decision without regard to the evidence before her?\n4) Did the PRRA officer breach the applicants right to procedural fairness by relying on updated documents and independent internet research, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW",
    "[9]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 458 (QL), Mr. Justice Luc Martineau stated the following on the issue of the proper standard of review for matters relating to PRRA decisions:\n 51 In my opinion, in applying the pragmatic and functional approach, where the impugned PRRA decision is considered globally and as a whole, the applicable standard of review should be reasonableness simpliciter ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL), at paragraph 13;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). That being said, where a particular finding of fact is made by the PRRA officer, the Court should not substitute its decision to that of the PRRA officer unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that such finding of fact was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the PRRA officer (paragraph 18.1(4)(d) [as enacted by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 5; 2002, c. 8, s. 27] of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at paragraph 14).",
    "[10]\nOn the question of the applicants right to procedural fairness, the decision of the PRRA officer must be reviewed on a standard of correctness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As such, if this Court finds that the duty of fairness owed to the applicant was violated, no deference will be given to the decision-maker and the application to set aside the decision will be granted (Congrégation des témoins de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nANALYSIS\n1) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that the discrimination faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution?",
    "[11]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred by failing to indicate what legal test she was using in order to differentiate between discrimination and persecution. The applicant maintains that there is a whole body of case law dealing with this issue that should have been mentioned by the PRRA officer to support her conclusion that the discrimination against Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution.",
    "[12]\nThe respondent for his part maintains that there is no specific legal test demonstrating when discrimination will amount to persecution. The determination is essentially factual, and within the authority and expertise of the decision-maker. The respondent submits that it was sufficient for the PRRA officer to recognize, as she did, that discrimination can amount to persecution, particularly in light of the fact that the Federal Court of Appeal has recognized that Post Claim Determination Officers (the predecessors of PRRA officers) are not required to provide reasons that are as detailed as a tribunals would be after an adjudicative hearing ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 1646 (QL)).",
    "[13]\nAs the applicant brings forth the argument that there exists a legal test for determining when discrimination amounts to persecution, it is necessary to consider the jurisprudence submitted by the applicant to this effect. The applicant relies on the decision of Mr. Justice Edmond P. Blanchard in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 866 (QL), citing an earlier decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 3, where Mr. Justice Louis Marceau explained the distinction between incidents of discrimination and incidents of persecution, as follows:\n 3 It is true that the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in the refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is true also that the identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination or harassment is not purely a question of fact but a mixed question of law and fact, legal concepts being involved. It remains, however, that, in all cases, it is for the Board to draw the conclusion in a particular factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein, and the intervention of this Court is not warranted unless the conclusion reached appears to be capricious or unreasonable.",
    "[14]\nThe applicant further refers to Justice Martineaus decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 586 (QL), as to the necessity to consider the cumulative impact of various discriminatory measures.",
    "[15]\nWhile the jurisprudence cited by the applicant makes it clear that a finding as to the well-founded fear of persecution of an applicant is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness, this jurisprudence fails to disclose which specific legal test must be applied to make such a determination, despite the applicants claim to the contrary.",
    "[16]\nIn light of the fact that the applicants claim is based on a single incident of violence followed by some telephone threats, and based on the objective evidence found in the country reports, the PRRA officer concluded as follows, after analysing a series of documents:\nEvidence found in country reports and articles indicate that there are elements of discrimination directed towards people who do not worship in the Islamic faith in Egypt. The evidence does not however indicate that this discrimination amounts to persecution. There are many Christians who practice their faith without difficulty. The state has taken steps to curtain acts of discrimination, through education programs, the establishment of a National Council on Human Rights and recognition as a national holiday; the observance of Christmas.\nThe applicant indicates than when he returned to Egypt during his mothers illness he lived with family in Cairo. [] The applicant has not submitted that he was subject to any incidents or had any problems while there. The evidence before me does not support that he would still be of interest to the local Muslims because of his relationship with a girl in 1996 or because of the risks faced by his father.",
    "[17]\nHaving considered the evidence and the officers reasons, I am satisfied that her finding that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution was reasonable and that she did not misapprehend any legal principle in the process. Furthermore, it is trite law that in order to establish an objective fear of persecution, a claimant must demonstrate that state protection is unavailable to him. This portion of the PRRA officers analysis will be considered in the next section of these reasons.\n2) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that state protection was available to the applicant?",
    "[18]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred by failing to examine the applicants particular situation as relates to state protection. While the PRRA officer considered whether Coptic Christians in general have access to state protection, she did not consider whether the applicant himself had access to state protection.",
    "[19]\nThe leading case on the question of state protection is the Supreme Court of Canadas decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it was stated that, absent a situation of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, there would be a presumption that a state is able to protect its citizens. Such a presumption in turn could be rebutted by a claimant who presented clear and convincing proof of the states inability to protect. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated at paragraph 50 of its reasons:\n 50 The issue that arises, then, is how, in a practical sense, a claimant makes proof of a state's inability to protect its nationals as well as the reasonable nature of the claimant's refusal actually to seek out this protection. On the facts of this case, proof on this point was unnecessary, as representatives of the state authorities conceded their inability to protect Ward. Where such an admission is not available, however,\nclear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided. For example, a claimant might advance testimony of similarly situated individuals let down by the state protection arrangement or the claimant's testimony of past personal incidents in which state protection did not materialize. Absent some evidence, the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens\n. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant. [my emphasis]",
    "[20]\nIn this case, it is clear from the evidence that the applicant failed to demonstrate that he himself had sought and been denied state protection. Instead, the applicant relied on the fact that his father was granted refugee status to demonstrate that state protection would not be available to him in Egypt. As proof, the applicant submitted his fathers PIF and the decision of the RPD, which did not include reasons for the decision.",
    "[21]\nA reading of the PRRA officers reasons discloses that the officer did in fact consider both the documentary evidence on the availability of state protection in general, as well as the applicants particular situation, but simply rejected the applicants argument to the effect that his fathers acceptance as a refugee was sufficient to demonstrate that state protection was unavailable to him. The officer noted that the fathers claim for refugee protection was based on very different facts than that of the applicant, as the incidents listed in his fathers PIF were mainly related to his business which printed religious material for the Church. There was also no mention in his fathers PIF that he sought state protection, other than to say, in relation to a particular beating, that it was pointless to report the incident to the police because the police operated with those who beat him, as they are all Muslims and they band together.",
    "[22]\nIn light of the evidence submitted to the PRRA officer, I agree with the respondent that the applicant did not meet the test set out in Ward, above, for rebutting the presumption of state protection, and that the PRRA officers conclusion on the availability of state protection was entirely reasonable.\n3) Did the PRRA officer err by rendering a decision without regard to the evidence before her?",
    "[23]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred in her assessment of the evidence by not mentioning contradictory evidence among the documents she cited, in particular evidence that showed problems with the electoral process and human rights abuses committed by the security forces in Egypt, and by dismissing an important document submitted by the applicant, a Masters thesis entitled The Coptic Christians of Egypt Today: Under Threat of Annihilation.",
    "[24]\nThe respondent for his part notes that it is trite law that a decision-maker is presumed to have considered all of the evidence and that the assessment of weight to be given to the evidence is a matter within the decision-makers discretion and expertise ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).",
    "[25]\nOn the issue of the selective use of the evidence, I agree with the respondent that the PRRA officer did refer to contradictory evidence, as she specifically listed examples of discrimination faced by Christians in Egypt.",
    "[26]\nOverall, the applicant has failed to convince me that the presumption that the officer considered all of the evidence before her has been rebutted in this case, and I will not interfere with her assessment of the relative weight to be given to this evidence in this judicial review application.",
    "[27]\nIn terms of the Masters thesis submitted by the applicant in support of his claim that Coptic Christians are persecuted in Egypt, it is clear from the reasons that the PRRA officer considered this particular piece of evidence, but found it to be of little probative value. I have reviewed the officers reasons for dismissing this document, including that the thesis was ten years old and referred to material even older and that it reflected the opinion of the author and his interpretation of the evidence. The PRRA officer stated that she preferred to rely instead on more objective documentation, such as the current country reports. Once again, it was within the purview of the officer to consider the evidence and weigh its probative value, and I can find nothing wrong with the officers decision to conclude that the document in question was of little probative value ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 850 (QL)).\n4) Did the PRRA officer breach the applicants right to procedural fairness by relying on updated documents and independent internet research, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond?",
    "[28]\nFinally, the applicant submits that, in conducting a unilateral internet search, in relying on uncommon documentary evidence not typically found in country conditions packages, and in relying heavily on updated documents and recent research, available long after the applicant submitted his application, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond, the officer breached the applicants right to procedural fairness.",
    "[29]\nWhile I agree with the respondents submission that it was normal for the PRRA officer to rely on updated country reports given the fact that the decision was made two years after the applicants submissions were received, the real issue is whether the PRRA officer had a duty to disclose to the applicant the documents she planned to consider in her analysis.",
    "[30]\nThe applicant relies on the recent decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 1401 (QL), where Justice Martineau concluded at paragraphs 8 to 10:\n 8 First, the PRRA officer violated the applicant's right to procedural fairness in the determination of his application for protection. The principles mentioned by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 27, are applicable here. It is apparent that the PRRA officer consulted relevant documentary extrinsic evidence found on the internet, upon which the applicant was never given an opportunity to comment. Such unilateral use of the internet is unfair ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 17-18).\n 9 In particular, the use of information from the Wikipedia website is highly questionable, as the reliability of its sources has not been demonstrated to the Court. Moreover, I note that the number of internet documents consulted by the PRRA officer is important. Of these documents, only the 2005 Amnesty International Country Report and the U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices -- 2005, are among the standard documents found in the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) Documentation Centres. (There is also a Country Report from 2004.)\n 10 The PRRA officer relied on other documents originating from public sources that related to general country conditions and that became available and accessible after the filing of the applicant's submissions. In view of the above finding, it is not necessary to determine whether or not they were \"novel\" and \"significant\" in light of the Mancia test (above, at para. 27).",
    "[31]\nJustice Martineau in turn relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), which sought to answer the following certified question:\nDoes an immigration officer conducting a review pursuant to the PDRCC regulations violate the principle of fairness, as enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Shah, when he or she fails to disclose, in advance of determining the matter, documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions?",
    "[32]\nAfter a thorough analysis of the issue, Mr. Justice Robert Décary concluded at paragraph 27:\n 27 I would therefore answer the certified question as follows, it being understood that each case will have to be decided according to its own circumstances and it being assumed that the documents at issue in a given case are of a nature such as that described above:\n(a) with respect to documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions which were available and accessible at Documentation Centres at the time submissions were made by an applicant, fairness does not require the post claims determination officer to disclose them in advance of determining the matter;\n(b) with respect to documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions which became available and accessible after the filing of an applicant's submissions, fairness requires disclosure by the post claims determination officer where they are novel and significant and where they evidence changes in the general country conditions that may affect the decision.",
    "[33]\nFirst of all, it is important to emphasize that the PRRA officer has not only the right but the duty to examine the most recent sources of information in conducting the risk assessment; the PRRA officer cannot be limited to the material filed by the applicant.",
    "[34]\nIn this case, the applicant is concerned by the use of updated versions of the U.S. Department of States Human Rights Report (U.S. DOS report) and the U.S. Department of States International Religious Freedom Report (Religious Freedom report). In his own submissions, the applicant relied on the 2003 U.S. DOS report and on the 2004 Religious Freedom report. The PRRA officer, for her part, relied on the 2004 and 2005 U.S. DOS reports and on the 2004 and 2005 Religious Freedom reports.",
    "[35]\nThere is no question that these updated reports are in the public domain, that they originate from well-known sources, that they are general in nature, and that they are frequently quoted by counsel involved in immigration cases on both sides. In fact, they are part of the standard country documentation packages relied on by immigration officers when considering various applications under the Act.",
    "[36]\nCounsel for the applicant was well aware of these documents, and relied on them. She also had significant experience with cases such as the applicants as she herself noted in a letter dated May 5, 2005, where she requested that the PRRA officer consider a document she had recently discovered and wished to add to the applicants file. She wrote:\nDear Madam/Sir:\nPlease be advised that I continue to represent Mr. Hassaballa in his application for PRRA consideration.\nI am writing to enclose a document which just came to my attention today and which I believe is relevant to the case. I ask that you please consider this document in coming to a conclusion on Mr. Hassaballas application.\nYou will note that the publication date of the thesis is 1996; however,\nI bring to your attention that this document was a private Masters Thesis until it was published on the internet on April 15, 2005\n. That is why it was completely impossible to have known about this document and to have provided it at the time of his refugee hearing. It is not reasonable to have expected the client or myself to have identified and submitted this document at an earlier date.\nI can tell you that I do quite a few Egyptian Christian cases and this document was unknown to me until this morning. If I did not know about it, then its not reasonable to have expected the client or his former counsel to have known about it either\n. I myself came upon it completely by chance this morning.\nI ask that you kindly review the document in its entirety, but, in particular the sections II, III and IV are quite relevant. [my emphasis]",
    "[37]\nIf counsel could find a private Masters thesis posted on the internet on the subject of Egyptian Coptic Christians, finding standard documents like the updated versions of the U.S. DOS report and the Religious Freedom report, also accessible on the internet, would not have posed a great challenge for her. Indeed, she should have known, in light of her experience dealing with such cases, that the PRRA officer would rely on these updated documents.",
    "[38]\nAs suggested by the respondent, in addition to the standard nature of the documents themselves, which is enough to counter the applicants submission on this point, the fact of counsels relative expertise in the area demonstrates that the documents were accessible to the respondent and that there was no breach of procedural fairness by the PRRA officer in relying on the most updated versions of these standard country reports, without giving notice to the applicant.",
    "[39]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 16 (QL), Madam Justice Eleanor Dawson concluded at paragraph 1(iii):\n(iii) The officer was not required to provide the applicants with an opportunity to comment upon two documents the officer relied upon, because the documents were available in the public domain, originated from a well-known source and were general in nature describing conditions in Libya for failed asylum claimants. In view of that, and the content of the documents the applicants did submit to the officer, the applicants were not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to fully and fairly present their case as to risk.\nJustice Dawson provided the following reasons for her conclusion at paragraph 52 of Al  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n 52 In my view, in light of the ongoing nature of the applicants' submissions with respect to risk, the public availability of the two documents at issue, the notoriety of the United Kingdom Home Office as a reliable source for country condition information, the general nature of the content of the two documents at issue, and the fact that Amnesty International documents on the same point were being submitted to the PRRA officer by the applicants the duty of fairness did not require disclosure of the two documents at issue. With due diligence the documents would have been available to the applicants. In view of that, and the content of the Amnesty International documents which the applicants did submit, the applicants were not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to fully and fairly present their case as to risk.",
    "[40]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 714 (QL), Strayer D.J. held at paragraph 8:\n 8 With respect to the Officer's consideration of the country reports, the applicants say that these were not registered at the documentation centre. While there was no sworn evidence on this that they were or were not registered, they were by their nature publicly available and an applicant has a responsibility to be aware of that.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para. 5. The same cases confirm that whether there has been a denial of fairness in this respect is a matter for the application judge to decide. I find the Officer's decision to resort to these reports to be reasonable. The two United Kingdom reports appear to have been issued in April and December 2004. The Officer did not render her decision until May 11, 2005 and the applicants had made their last submissions in writing the day before it was issued. Had they sought and obtained these reports they could have made submissions on them.",
    "[41]\nI agree with the respondent that in reviewing and comparing the updated documents, the applicant did not provide convincing evidence that there were novel and significant changes in the general country conditions that could have affected the PRRA officers decision. In fact, the substance of the excerpts provided by the applicants counsel in paragraphs 44 to 49 of his submissions, demonstrate that conversion of Muslims to Christianity remains problematic and prohibited by Sharia Law, that there are reports of forced conversions of Christian women, and that Christians continue to face discrimination in Egypt. The reference to a successful judicial outcome for a woman who converted to Islam and then back to Christianity has nothing to do whatsoever with the applicants case.",
    "[42]\nTo repeat myself, I am far from being convinced that the updated versions of the documents referred to are novel and significant to the point that they could affect the decision of the PRRA officer, as discussed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[43]\nFurthermore, the officers reliance on uncommon sources does not justify this Courts intervention either. The reference to NDTV.com concerns an address by President Mubarak at a university where he exhorted Muslim scholars to teach tolerance and shun extremism. The Asia Times source was relied on to demonstrate that the government investigates and arrests extremists, including members of the Gamaa Islamiya, a fact that was also reported in the 2003 U.S. DOS report filed by the applicant. Finally, the United Nations Cyber School Bus website provided general information about Cairo and the size of its population, expected to reach 13.2 million residents by 2010, which is in no way controversial information.\nCONCLUSION",
    "[44]\nFor all of the above reasons, I am satisfied that it was not unreasonable for the PRRA officer to reject the application for protection, in light of the evidence before her, and that she has not committed any reviewable error that could justify the intervention of this Court.",
    "[45]\nTherefore, this application for judicial review is denied.",
    "[46]\nNeither counsel suggested questions for certification.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[47]\n1. The application is denied;\n2. No questions for certification.\nANNEX\nRELEVANT LEGISLATION\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27\n112.

(1) A decision to authorize the application for protection has\n(a) in the case of an applicant not described in subsection 112(3), the effect of conferring refugee protection; and\n(b) in the case of an applicant described in subsection 112(3), the effect of staying the removal order with respect to a country or place in respect of which the applicant was determined to be in need of protection.\n(2) If the Minister is of the opinion that the circumstances surrounding a stay of the enforcement of a removal order have changed, the Minister may re-examine, in accordance with paragraph 113(d) and the regulations, the grounds on which the application was authorized and may cancel the stay.\n(3) If the Minister is of the opinion that a decision to allow an application for protection was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts on a relevant matter, the Minister may vacate the decision.\n(4) If a decision is vacated under subsection (3), it is nullified and the application for protection is deemed to have been rejected.\n112. (1) A person in Canada who is not referred to in subsection 115(1) may, in accordance with the regulations, apply to the Minister for protection if the person is the subject of a removal order that has taken effect or is named in the certificate referred to in subsection 77(1).\n(2) She is not entitled to request protection in the following cases:\n(a) the person is the subject of an order instituting proceedings made under section 15 of the Extradition Act;\n(b) his application for asylum was found inadmissible under paragraph 101(1)(e);\n(c) if he has not left Canada after the rejection of his application for protection, the period provided for by regulation has not expired;\nd) otherwise, six months have not passed since his departure following either the rejection of his request for asylum or protection, or a declaration of inadmissibility, withdrawal or withdrawal of his request for asylum.\n(3) Asylum cannot be granted to the applicant in the following cases:\n(a) he is inadmissible for reasons of security or for violations of human or international rights or organized crime;\n(b) he is inadmissible for serious criminality for conviction in Canada punishable by imprisonment of at least two years or for any conviction outside Canada for an offense which, committed in Canada, would constitute an offense against a federal law punishable by a maximum imprisonment of at least ten years;\n(c) his application for asylum under section F of article 1 of the Refugee Convention has been rejected;\n(d) he is named in the certificate referred to in subsection 77(1).\n113. The request is disposed of as follows:\n(a) the rejected asylum applicant may only present evidence which has arisen since the rejection or which was not then normally accessible or, if it was, it was not reasonable, in the circumstances, to expect him to have presented it at the time of the rejection;\n(b) a hearing may be held if the Minister considers it necessary taking into account regulatory factors;\n(c) in respect of an applicant not referred to in subsection 112(3), on the basis of sections 96 to 98;\n(d) in relation to the applicant referred to in subsection 112(3), on the basis of the elements mentioned in section 97 and, secondly:\n(i) because the applicant inadmissible for serious criminality constitutes a danger to the public in Canada,\n(ii) in the case of any other applicant, because the application should be refused because of the nature and seriousness of his past acts or the danger he poses to the security of Canada.\n114. (1) The decision granting the application for protection has the effect of conferring asylum on the applicant; however, it has the effect, with respect to the person referred to in subsection 112(3), of staying, for the country or place in question, the removal order affecting it.\n(2) The Minister may revoke the suspension if he considers, after examination, on the basis of paragraph 113(d) and in accordance with the regulations, the reasons which justified it, that the circumstances which gave rise to it have changed.\n(3) The Minister may annul the decision granting the application for protection if he considers that it results from erroneous presentations of an important fact regarding a relevant subject, or from reluctance on this fact.\n(4) The annulment decision nullifies the initial decision and the application for protection is deemed to have been rejected.\n[End of document]"

Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2007] F.T.R. TBEd. MY.016.\n[1]\nBlais, J.\n: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), for judicial review of a decision by a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer made on October 25, 2006, to refuse an application for protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[2]\nRoger George S. Rizk Hassaballa (the applicant) is a citizen of Egypt who came to Canada on December 10, 2003, after being denied asylum in the United States for lack of sufficient documentation, and made a claim for refugee protection immediately upon arriving in Canada.\n[3]\nOn February 11, 2004, the applicants claim for refugee protection was determined by the Refugee Protection Division (the RPD) to be abandoned, as a result of his failure to submit his Personal Information Form (PIF) on time. On March 2, 2004, the applicant filed an application to re-open his claim for refugee protection, which was denied, as was his application for judicial review of that decision (IMM-6813-04).\n[4]\nThe applicants claim to refugee protection was based on a well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of religion, for being a Coptic Christian. Specifically, the applicant claimed to have been attacked and beaten by a group of fundamentalist Muslims, members of the Gamaa Islamiya organization, and to have received telephone threats, all stemming from his friendship with a young Muslim woman who had expressed a strong interest in Christianity. The applicant also alleged that he was a person in need of protection based on a danger of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment, should he be forced to return to Egypt. Further, the applicant submitted that the government in Egypt was unwilling or unable to provide protection, and indeed tacitly condoned and often engaged in the persecution of Christians.\n[5]\nOn November 17, 2004, the applicant filed an application for protection under section 112 of the Act. Material in support of the PRRA was submitted by his counsel on December 8, 2004, and again on May 5, 2005.\nDECISION UNDER REVIEW\n[6]\nIn a decision made on October 25, 2006, the PRRA officer rejected the application, finding that, based on the evidence before her, there was no more than a mere possibility that the applicant would be subjected to persecution should he return to Egypt. The officer also concluded that there were no substantial grounds to believe that the applicant would face a risk of torture, nor were there reasonable grounds to believe that he would face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[7]\nIn her detailed analysis, the PRRA officer did not question the applicants credibility with respect to his story of what happened to him ten years ago, but found no evidence to suggest that the people who allegedly harassed and physically injured him at that time would still be interested in him today. In any event, the officer noted that the applicant could always relocate to another region of Egypt if he was not comfortable returning to Alexandria where these events occurred. The PRRA officer also concluded that the discrimination suffered by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution and that the presumption of state protection had not been rebutted.\nISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION\n[8]\nThe following issues must be considered in this judicial review application:\n1) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that the discrimination faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution?\n2) Did the PRRA officer err in determining that state protection was available to the applicant?\n3) Did the PRRA officer err by rendering a decision without regard to the evidence before her?\n4) Did the PRRA officer breach the applicants right to procedural fairness by relying on updated documents and independent internet research, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[9]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 458 (QL), Mr. Justice Luc Martineau stated the following on the issue of the proper standard of review for matters relating to PRRA decisions:\n 51 In my opinion, in applying the pragmatic and functional approach, where the impugned PRRA decision is considered globally and as a whole, the applicable standard of review should be reasonableness simpliciter ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL), at paragraph 13;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). That being said, where a particular finding of fact is made by the PRRA officer, the Court should not substitute its decision to that of the PRRA officer unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that such finding of fact was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the PRRA officer (paragraph 18.1(4)(d) [as enacted by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 5; 2002, c. 8, s. 27] of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at paragraph 14).\n[10]\nOn the question of the applicants right to procedural fairness, the decision of the PRRA officer must be reviewed on a standard of correctness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As such, if this Court finds that the duty of fairness owed to the applicant was violated, no deference will be given to the decision-maker and the application to set aside the decision will be granted (Congrégation des témoins de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nANALYSIS\n1) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that the discrimination faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution?\n[11]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred by failing to indicate what legal test she was using in order to differentiate between discrimination and persecution. The applicant maintains that there is a whole body of case law dealing with this issue that should have been mentioned by the PRRA officer to support her conclusion that the discrimination against Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution.\n[12]\nThe respondent for his part maintains that there is no specific legal test demonstrating when discrimination will amount to persecution. The determination is essentially factual, and within the authority and expertise of the decision-maker. The respondent submits that it was sufficient for the PRRA officer to recognize, as she did, that discrimination can amount to persecution, particularly in light of the fact that the Federal Court of Appeal has recognized that Post Claim Determination Officers (the predecessors of PRRA officers) are not required to provide reasons that are as detailed as a tribunals would be after an adjudicative hearing ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 1646 (QL)).\n[13]\nAs the applicant brings forth the argument that there exists a legal test for determining when discrimination amounts to persecution, it is necessary to consider the jurisprudence submitted by the applicant to this effect. The applicant relies on the decision of Mr. Justice Edmond P. Blanchard in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 866 (QL), citing an earlier decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 3, where Mr. Justice Louis Marceau explained the distinction between incidents of discrimination and incidents of persecution, as follows:\n 3 It is true that the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in the refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is true also that the identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination or harassment is not purely a question of fact but a mixed question of law and fact, legal concepts being involved. It remains, however, that, in all cases, it is for the Board to draw the conclusion in a particular factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein, and the intervention of this Court is not warranted unless the conclusion reached appears to be capricious or unreasonable.\n[14]\nThe applicant further refers to Justice Martineaus decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 586 (QL), as to the necessity to consider the cumulative impact of various discriminatory measures.\n[15]\nWhile the jurisprudence cited by the applicant makes it clear that a finding as to the well-founded fear of persecution of an applicant is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness, this jurisprudence fails to disclose which specific legal test must be applied to make such a determination, despite the applicants claim to the contrary.\n[16]\nIn light of the fact that the applicants claim is based on a single incident of violence followed by some telephone threats, and based on the objective evidence found in the country reports, the PRRA officer concluded as follows, after analysing a series of documents:\nEvidence found in country reports and articles indicate that there are elements of discrimination directed towards people who do not worship in the Islamic faith in Egypt. The evidence does not however indicate that this discrimination amounts to persecution. There are many Christians who practice their faith without difficulty. The state has taken steps to curtain acts of discrimination, through education programs, the establishment of a National Council on Human Rights and recognition as a national holiday; the observance of Christmas.\nThe applicant indicates than when he returned to Egypt during his mothers illness he lived with family in Cairo. [] The applicant has not submitted that he was subject to any incidents or had any problems while there. The evidence before me does not support that he would still be of interest to the local Muslims because of his relationship with a girl in 1996 or because of the risks faced by his father.\n[17]\nHaving considered the evidence and the officers reasons, I am satisfied that her finding that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution was reasonable and that she did not misapprehend any legal principle in the process. Furthermore, it is trite law that in order to establish an objective fear of persecution, a claimant must demonstrate that state protection is unavailable to him. This portion of the PRRA officers analysis will be considered in the next section of these reasons.\n2) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that state protection was available to the applicant?\n[18]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred by failing to examine the applicants particular situation as relates to state protection. While the PRRA officer considered whether Coptic Christians in general have access to state protection, she did not consider whether the applicant himself had access to state protection.\n[19]\nThe leading case on the question of state protection is the Supreme Court of Canadas decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it was stated that, absent a situation of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, there would be a presumption that a state is able to protect its citizens. Such a presumption in turn could be rebutted by a claimant who presented clear and convincing proof of the states inability to protect. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated at paragraph 50 of its reasons:\n 50 The issue that arises, then, is how, in a practical sense, a claimant makes proof of a state's inability to protect its nationals as well as the reasonable nature of the claimant's refusal actually to seek out this protection. On the facts of this case, proof on this point was unnecessary, as representatives of the state authorities conceded their inability to protect Ward. Where such an admission is not available, however,\nclear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided. For example, a claimant might advance testimony of similarly situated individuals let down by the state protection arrangement or the claimant's testimony of past personal incidents in which state protection did not materialize. Absent some evidence, the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens\n. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant. [my emphasis]\n[20]\nIn this case, it is clear from the evidence that the applicant failed to demonstrate that he himself had sought and been denied state protection. Instead, the applicant relied on the fact that his father was granted refugee status to demonstrate that state protection would not be available to him in Egypt. As proof, the applicant submitted his fathers PIF and the decision of the RPD, which did not include reasons for the decision.\n[21]\nA reading of the PRRA officers reasons discloses that the officer did in fact consider both the documentary evidence on the availability of state protection in general, as well as the applicants particular situation, but simply rejected the applicants argument to the effect that his fathers acceptance as a refugee was sufficient to demonstrate that state protection was unavailable to him. The officer noted that the fathers claim for refugee protection was based on very different facts than that of the applicant, as the incidents listed in his fathers PIF were mainly related to his business which printed religious material for the Church. There was also no mention in his fathers PIF that he sought state protection, other than to say, in relation to a particular beating, that it was pointless to report the incident to the police because the police operated with those who beat him, as they are all Muslims and they band together.\n[22]\nIn light of the evidence submitted to the PRRA officer, I agree with the respondent that the applicant did not meet the test set out in Ward, above, for rebutting the presumption of state protection, and that the PRRA officers conclusion on the availability of state protection was entirely reasonable.\n3) Did the PRRA officer err by rendering a decision without regard to the evidence before her?\n[23]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred in her assessment of the evidence by not mentioning contradictory evidence among the documents she cited, in particular evidence that showed problems with the electoral process and human rights abuses committed by the security forces in Egypt, and by dismissing an important document submitted by the applicant, a Masters thesis entitled The Coptic Christians of Egypt Today: Under Threat of Annihilation.\n[24]\nThe respondent for his part notes that it is trite law that a decision-maker is presumed to have considered all of the evidence and that the assessment of weight to be given to the evidence is a matter within the decision-makers discretion and expertise ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\n[25]\nOn the issue of the selective use of the evidence, I agree with the respondent that the PRRA officer did refer to contradictory evidence, as she specifically listed examples of discrimination faced by Christians in Egypt.\n[26]\nOverall, the applicant has failed to convince me that the presumption that the officer considered all of the evidence before her has been rebutted in this case, and I will not interfere with her assessment of the relative weight to be given to this evidence in this judicial review application.\n[27]\nIn terms of the Masters thesis submitted by the applicant in support of his claim that Coptic Christians are persecuted in Egypt, it is clear from the reasons that the PRRA officer considered this particular piece of evidence, but found it to be of little probative value. I have reviewed the officers reasons for dismissing this document, including that the thesis was ten years old and referred to material even older and that it reflected the opinion of the author and his interpretation of the evidence. The PRRA officer stated that she preferred to rely instead on more objective documentation, such as the current country reports. Once again, it was within the purview of the officer to consider the evidence and weigh its probative value, and I can find nothing wrong with the officers decision to conclude that the document in question was of little probative value ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 850 (QL)).\n4) Did the PRRA officer breach the applicants right to procedural fairness by relying on updated documents and independent internet research, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond?\n[28]\nFinally, the applicant submits that, in conducting a unilateral internet search, in relying on uncommon documentary evidence not typically found in country conditions packages, and in relying heavily on updated documents and recent research, available long after the applicant submitted his application, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond, the officer breached the applicants right to procedural fairness.\n[29]\nWhile I agree with the respondents submission that it was normal for the PRRA officer to rely on updated country reports given the fact that the decision was made two years after the applicants submissions were received, the real issue is whether the PRRA officer had a duty to disclose to the applicant the documents she planned to consider in her analysis.\n[30]\nThe applicant relies on the recent decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 1401 (QL), where Justice Martineau concluded at paragraphs 8 to 10:\n 8 First, the PRRA officer violated the applicant's right to procedural fairness in the determination of his application for protection. The principles mentioned by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 27, are applicable here. It is apparent that the PRRA officer consulted relevant documentary extrinsic evidence found on the internet, upon which the applicant was never given an opportunity to comment. Such unilateral use of the internet is unfair ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 17-18).\n 9 In particular, the use of information from the Wikipedia website is highly questionable, as the reliability of its sources has not been demonstrated to the Court. Moreover, I note that the number of internet documents consulted by the PRRA officer is important. Of these documents, only the 2005 Amnesty International Country Report and the U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices -- 2005, are among the standard documents found in the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) Documentation Centres. (There is also a Country Report from 2004.)\n 10 The PRRA officer relied on other documents originating from public sources that related to general country conditions and that became available and accessible after the filing of the applicant's submissions. In view of the above finding, it is not necessary to determine whether or not they were \"novel\" and \"significant\" in light of the Mancia test (above, at para. 27).\n[31]\nJustice Martineau in turn relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), which sought to answer the following certified question:\nDoes an immigration officer conducting a review pursuant to the PDRCC regulations violate the principle of fairness, as enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Shah, when he or she fails to disclose, in advance of determining the matter, documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions?\n[32]\nAfter a thorough analysis of the issue, Mr. Justice Robert Décary concluded at paragraph 27:\n 27 I would therefore answer the certified question as follows, it being understood that each case will have to be decided according to its own circumstances and it being assumed that the documents at issue in a given case are of a nature such as that described above:\n(a) with respect to documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions which were available and accessible at Documentation Centres at the time submissions were made by an applicant, fairness does not require the post claims determination officer to disclose them in advance of determining the matter;\n(b) with respect to documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions which became available and accessible after the filing of an applicant's submissions, fairness requires disclosure by the post claims determination officer where they are novel and significant and where they evidence changes in the general country conditions that may affect the decision.\n[33]\nFirst of all, it is important to emphasize that the PRRA officer has not only the right but the duty to examine the most recent sources of information in conducting the risk assessment; the PRRA officer cannot be limited to the material filed by the applicant.\n[34]\nIn this case, the applicant is concerned by the use of updated versions of the U.S. Department of States Human Rights Report (U.S. DOS report) and the U.S. Department of States International Religious Freedom Report (Religious Freedom report). In his own submissions, the applicant relied on the 2003 U.S. DOS report and on the 2004 Religious Freedom report. The PRRA officer, for her part, relied on the 2004 and 2005 U.S. DOS reports and on the 2004 and 2005 Religious Freedom reports.\n[35]\nThere is no question that these updated reports are in the public domain, that they originate from well-known sources, that they are general in nature, and that they are frequently quoted by counsel involved in immigration cases on both sides. In fact, they are part of the standard country documentation packages relied on by immigration officers when considering various applications under the Act.\n[36]\nCounsel for the applicant was well aware of these documents, and relied on them. She also had significant experience with cases such as the applicants as she herself noted in a letter dated May 5, 2005, where she requested that the PRRA officer consider a document she had recently discovered and wished to add to the applicants file. She wrote:\nDear Madam/Sir:\nPlease be advised that I continue to represent Mr. Hassaballa in his application for PRRA consideration.\nI am writing to enclose a document which just came to my attention today and which I believe is relevant to the case. I ask that you please consider this document in coming to a conclusion on Mr. Hassaballas application.\nYou will note that the publication date of the thesis is 1996; however,\nI bring to your attention that this document was a private Masters Thesis until it was published on the internet on April 15, 2005\n. That is why it was completely impossible to have known about this document and to have provided it at the time of his refugee hearing. It is not reasonable to have expected the client or myself to have identified and submitted this document at an earlier date.\nI can tell you that I do quite a few Egyptian Christian cases and this document was unknown to me until this morning. If I did not know about it, then its not reasonable to have expected the client or his former counsel to have known about it either\n. I myself came upon it completely by chance this morning.\nI ask that you kindly review the document in its entirety, but, in particular the sections II, III and IV are quite relevant. [my emphasis]\n[37]\nIf counsel could find a private Masters thesis posted on the internet on the subject of Egyptian Coptic Christians, finding standard documents like the updated versions of the U.S. DOS report and the Religious Freedom report, also accessible on the internet, would not have posed a great challenge for her. Indeed, she should have known, in light of her experience dealing with such cases, that the PRRA officer would rely on these updated documents.\n[38]\nAs suggested by the respondent, in addition to the standard nature of the documents themselves, which is enough to counter the applicants submission on this point, the fact of counsels relative expertise in the area demonstrates that the documents were accessible to the respondent and that there was no breach of procedural fairness by the PRRA officer in relying on the most updated versions of these standard country reports, without giving notice to the applicant.\n[39]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 16 (QL), Madam Justice Eleanor Dawson concluded at paragraph 1(iii):\n(iii) The officer was not required to provide the applicants with an opportunity to comment upon two documents the officer relied upon, because the documents were available in the public domain, originated from a well-known source and were general in nature describing conditions in Libya for failed asylum claimants. In view of that, and the content of the documents the applicants did submit to the officer, the applicants were not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to fully and fairly present their case as to risk.\nJustice Dawson provided the following reasons for her conclusion at paragraph 52 of Al  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n 52 In my view, in light of the ongoing nature of the applicants' submissions with respect to risk, the public availability of the two documents at issue, the notoriety of the United Kingdom Home Office as a reliable source for country condition information, the general nature of the content of the two documents at issue, and the fact that Amnesty International documents on the same point were being submitted to the PRRA officer by the applicants the duty of fairness did not require disclosure of the two documents at issue. With due diligence the documents would have been available to the applicants. In view of that, and the content of the Amnesty International documents which the applicants did submit, the applicants were not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to fully and fairly present their case as to risk.\n[40]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 714 (QL), Strayer D.J. held at paragraph 8:\n 8 With respect to the Officer's consideration of the country reports, the applicants say that these were not registered at the documentation centre. While there was no sworn evidence on this that they were or were not registered, they were by their nature publicly available and an applicant has a responsibility to be aware of that.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para. 5. The same cases confirm that whether there has been a denial of fairness in this respect is a matter for the application judge to decide. I find the Officer's decision to resort to these reports to be reasonable. The two United Kingdom reports appear to have been issued in April and December 2004. The Officer did not render her decision until May 11, 2005 and the applicants had made their last submissions in writing the day before it was issued. Had they sought and obtained these reports they could have made submissions on them.\n[41]\nI agree with the respondent that in reviewing and comparing the updated documents, the applicant did not provide convincing evidence that there were novel and significant changes in the general country conditions that could have affected the PRRA officers decision. In fact, the substance of the excerpts provided by the applicants counsel in paragraphs 44 to 49 of his submissions, demonstrate that conversion of Muslims to Christianity remains problematic and prohibited by Sharia Law, that there are reports of forced conversions of Christian women, and that Christians continue to face discrimination in Egypt. The reference to a successful judicial outcome for a woman who converted to Islam and then back to Christianity has nothing to do whatsoever with the applicants case.\n[42]\nTo repeat myself, I am far from being convinced that the updated versions of the documents referred to are novel and significant to the point that they could affect the decision of the PRRA officer, as discussed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[43]\nFurthermore, the officers reliance on uncommon sources does not justify this Courts intervention either. The reference to NDTV.com concerns an address by President Mubarak at a university where he exhorted Muslim scholars to teach tolerance and shun extremism. The Asia Times source was relied on to demonstrate that the government investigates and arrests extremists, including members of the Gamaa Islamiya, a fact that was also reported in the 2003 U.S. DOS report filed by the applicant. Finally, the United Nations Cyber School Bus website provided general information about Cairo and the size of its population, expected to reach 13.2 million residents by 2010, which is in no way controversial information.\nCONCLUSION\n[44]\nFor all of the above reasons, I am satisfied that it was not unreasonable for the PRRA officer to reject the application for protection, in light of the evidence before her, and that she has not committed any reviewable error that could justify the intervention of this Court.\n[45]\nTherefore, this application for judicial review is denied.\n[46]\nNeither counsel suggested questions for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n[47]\n1. The application is denied;\n2. No question for certification.\nANNEX\nPERTINENT LEGISLATION\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27\n112.

Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2007] F.T.R. TBEd. MY.016.\n\n[1]\nBlais, J.\n: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), for judicial review of a decision by a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer made on October 25, 2006, to refuse an application for protection.\nBACKGROUND\n\n[2]\nRoger George S. Rizk Hassaballa (the applicant) is a citizen of Egypt who came to Canada on December 10, 2003, after being denied asylum in the United States for lack of sufficient documentation, and made a claim for refugee protection immediately upon arriving in Canada.\n\n[3]\nOn February 11, 2004, the applicants claim for refugee protection was determined by the Refugee Protection Division (the RPD) to be abandoned, as a result of his failure to submit his Personal Information Form (PIF) on time. On March 2, 2004, the applicant filed an application to re-open his claim for refugee protection, which was denied, as was his application for judicial review of that decision (IMM-6813-04).\n\n[4]\nThe applicants claim to refugee protection was based on a well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of religion, for being a Coptic Christian. Specifically, the applicant claimed to have been attacked and beaten by a group of fundamentalist Muslims, members of the Gamaa Islamiya organization, and to have received telephone threats, all stemming from his friendship with a young Muslim woman who had expressed a strong interest in Christianity. The applicant also alleged that he was a person in need of protection based on a danger of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment, should he be forced to return to Egypt. Further, the applicant submitted that the government in Egypt was unwilling or unable to provide protection, and indeed tacitly condoned and often engaged in the persecution of Christians.\n\n[5]\nOn November 17, 2004, the applicant filed an application for protection under section 112 of the Act. Material in support of the PRRA was submitted by his counsel on December 8, 2004, and again on May 5, 2005.\nDECISION UNDER REVIEW\n\n[6]\nIn a decision made on October 25, 2006, the PRRA officer rejected the application, finding that, based on the evidence before her, there was no more than a mere possibility that the applicant would be subjected to persecution should he return to Egypt. The officer also concluded that there were no substantial grounds to believe that the applicant would face a risk of torture, nor were there reasonable grounds to believe that he would face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n\n[7]\nIn her detailed analysis, the PRRA officer did not question the applicants credibility with respect to his story of what happened to him ten years ago, but found no evidence to suggest that the people who allegedly harassed and physically injured him at that time would still be interested in him today. In any event, the officer noted that the applicant could always relocate to another region of Egypt if he was not comfortable returning to Alexandria where these events occurred. The PRRA officer also concluded that the discrimination suffered by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution and that the presumption of state protection had not been rebutted.\nISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION\n\n[8]\nThe following issues must be considered in this judicial review application:\n1) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that the discrimination faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution?\n2) Did the PRRA officer err in determining that state protection was available to the applicant?\n3) Did the PRRA officer err by rendering a decision without regard to the evidence before her?\n4) Did the PRRA officer breach the applicants right to procedural fairness by relying on updated documents and independent internet research, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[9]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 458 (QL), Mr. Justice Luc Martineau stated the following on the issue of the proper standard of review for matters relating to PRRA decisions:\n 51 In my opinion, in applying the pragmatic and functional approach, where the impugned PRRA decision is considered globally and as a whole, the applicable standard of review should be reasonableness simpliciter ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL), at paragraph 13;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). That being said, where a particular finding of fact is made by the PRRA officer, the Court should not substitute its decision to that of the PRRA officer unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that such finding of fact was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the PRRA officer (paragraph 18.1(4)(d) [as enacted by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 5; 2002, c. 8, s. 27] of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at paragraph 14).\n\n[10]\nOn the question of the applicants right to procedural fairness, the decision of the PRRA officer must be reviewed on a standard of correctness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As such, if this Court finds that the duty of fairness owed to the applicant was violated, no deference will be given to the decision-maker and the application to set aside the decision will be granted (Congrégation des témoins de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nANALYSIS\n1) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that the discrimination faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution?\n\n[11]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred by failing to indicate what legal test she was using in order to differentiate between discrimination and persecution. The applicant maintains that there is a whole body of case law dealing with this issue that should have been mentioned by the PRRA officer to support her conclusion that the discrimination against Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution.\n\n[12]\nThe respondent for his part maintains that there is no specific legal test demonstrating when discrimination will amount to persecution. The determination is essentially factual, and within the authority and expertise of the decision-maker. The respondent submits that it was sufficient for the PRRA officer to recognize, as she did, that discrimination can amount to persecution, particularly in light of the fact that the Federal Court of Appeal has recognized that Post Claim Determination Officers (the predecessors of PRRA officers) are not required to provide reasons that are as detailed as a tribunals would be after an adjudicative hearing ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 1646 (QL)).\n\n[13]\nAs the applicant brings forth the argument that there exists a legal test for determining when discrimination amounts to persecution, it is necessary to consider the jurisprudence submitted by the applicant to this effect. The applicant relies on the decision of Mr. Justice Edmond P. Blanchard in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 866 (QL), citing an earlier decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 3, where Mr. Justice Louis Marceau explained the distinction between incidents of discrimination and incidents of persecution, as follows:\n 3 It is true that the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in the refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is true also that the identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination or harassment is not purely a question of fact but a mixed question of law and fact, legal concepts being involved. It remains, however, that, in all cases, it is for the Board to draw the conclusion in a particular factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein, and the intervention of this Court is not warranted unless the conclusion reached appears to be capricious or unreasonable.\n\n[14]\nThe applicant further refers to Justice Martineaus decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 586 (QL), as to the necessity to consider the cumulative impact of various discriminatory measures.\n\n[15]\nWhile the jurisprudence cited by the applicant makes it clear that a finding as to the well-founded fear of persecution of an applicant is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness, this jurisprudence fails to disclose which specific legal test must be applied to make such a determination, despite the applicants claim to the contrary.\n\n[16]\nIn light of the fact that the applicants claim is based on a single incident of violence followed by some telephone threats, and based on the objective evidence found in the country reports, the PRRA officer concluded as follows, after analysing a series of documents:\nEvidence found in country reports and articles indicate that there are elements of discrimination directed towards people who do not worship in the Islamic faith in Egypt. The evidence does not however indicate that this discrimination amounts to persecution. There are many Christians who practice their faith without difficulty. The state has taken steps to curtain acts of discrimination, through education programs, the establishment of a National Council on Human Rights and recognition as a national holiday; the observance of Christmas.\nThe applicant indicates than when he returned to Egypt during his mothers illness he lived with family in Cairo. [] The applicant has not submitted that he was subject to any incidents or had any problems while there. The evidence before me does not support that he would still be of interest to the local Muslims because of his relationship with a girl in 1996 or because of the risks faced by his father.\n\n[17]\nHaving considered the evidence and the officers reasons, I am satisfied that her finding that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution was reasonable and that she did not misapprehend any legal principle in the process. Furthermore, it is trite law that in order to establish an objective fear of persecution, a claimant must demonstrate that state protection is unavailable to him. This portion of the PRRA officers analysis will be considered in the next section of these reasons.\n2) Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that state protection was available to the applicant?\n\n[18]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred by failing to examine the applicants particular situation as relates to state protection. While the PRRA officer considered whether Coptic Christians in general have access to state protection, she did not consider whether the applicant himself had access to state protection.\n\n[19]\nThe leading case on the question of state protection is the Supreme Court of Canadas decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it was stated that, absent a situation of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, there would be a presumption that a state is able to protect its citizens. Such a presumption in turn could be rebutted by a claimant who presented clear and convincing proof of the states inability to protect. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated at paragraph 50 of its reasons:\n 50 The issue that arises, then, is how, in a practical sense, a claimant makes proof of a state's inability to protect its nationals as well as the reasonable nature of the claimant's refusal actually to seek out this protection. On the facts of this case, proof on this point was unnecessary, as representatives of the state authorities conceded their inability to protect Ward. Where such an admission is not available, however,\nclear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided. For example, a claimant might advance testimony of similarly situated individuals let down by the state protection arrangement or the claimant's testimony of past personal incidents in which state protection did not materialize. Absent some evidence, the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens\n. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant. [my emphasis]\n\n[20]\nIn this case, it is clear from the evidence that the applicant failed to demonstrate that he himself had sought and been denied state protection. Instead, the applicant relied on the fact that his father was granted refugee status to demonstrate that state protection would not be available to him in Egypt. As proof, the applicant submitted his fathers PIF and the decision of the RPD, which did not include reasons for the decision.\n\n[21]\nA reading of the PRRA officers reasons discloses that the officer did in fact consider both the documentary evidence on the availability of state protection in general, as well as the applicants particular situation, but simply rejected the applicants argument to the effect that his fathers acceptance as a refugee was sufficient to demonstrate that state protection was unavailable to him. The officer noted that the fathers claim for refugee protection was based on very different facts than that of the applicant, as the incidents listed in his fathers PIF were mainly related to his business which printed religious material for the Church. There was also no mention in his fathers PIF that he sought state protection, other than to say, in relation to a particular beating, that it was pointless to report the incident to the police because the police operated with those who beat him, as they are all Muslims and they band together.\n\n[22]\nIn light of the evidence submitted to the PRRA officer, I agree with the respondent that the applicant did not meet the test set out in Ward, above, for rebutting the presumption of state protection, and that the PRRA officers conclusion on the availability of state protection was entirely reasonable.\n3) Did the PRRA officer err by rendering a decision without regard to the evidence before her?\n\n[23]\nThe applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred in her assessment of the evidence by not mentioning contradictory evidence among the documents she cited, in particular evidence that showed problems with the electoral process and human rights abuses committed by the security forces in Egypt, and by dismissing an important document submitted by the applicant, a Masters thesis entitled The Coptic Christians of Egypt Today: Under Threat of Annihilation.\n\n[24]\nThe respondent for his part notes that it is trite law that a decision-maker is presumed to have considered all of the evidence and that the assessment of weight to be given to the evidence is a matter within the decision-makers discretion and expertise ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\n\n[25]\nOn the issue of the selective use of the evidence, I agree with the respondent that the PRRA officer did refer to contradictory evidence, as she specifically listed examples of discrimination faced by Christians in Egypt.\n\n[26]\nOverall, the applicant has failed to convince me that the presumption that the officer considered all of the evidence before her has been rebutted in this case, and I will not interfere with her assessment of the relative weight to be given to this evidence in this judicial review application.\n\n[27]\nIn terms of the Masters thesis submitted by the applicant in support of his claim that Coptic Christians are persecuted in Egypt, it is clear from the reasons that the PRRA officer considered this particular piece of evidence, but found it to be of little probative value. I have reviewed the officers reasons for dismissing this document, including that the thesis was ten years old and referred to material even older and that it reflected the opinion of the author and his interpretation of the evidence. The PRRA officer stated that she preferred to rely instead on more objective documentation, such as the current country reports. Once again, it was within the purview of the officer to consider the evidence and weigh its probative value, and I can find nothing wrong with the officers decision to conclude that the document in question was of little probative value ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 850 (QL)).\n4) Did the PRRA officer breach the applicants right to procedural fairness by relying on updated documents and independent internet research, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond?\n\n[28]\nFinally, the applicant submits that, in conducting a unilateral internet search, in relying on uncommon documentary evidence not typically found in country conditions packages, and in relying heavily on updated documents and recent research, available long after the applicant submitted his application, without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond, the officer breached the applicants right to procedural fairness.\n\n[29]\nWhile I agree with the respondents submission that it was normal for the PRRA officer to rely on updated country reports given the fact that the decision was made two years after the applicants submissions were received, the real issue is whether the PRRA officer had a duty to disclose to the applicant the documents she planned to consider in her analysis.\n\n[30]\nThe applicant relies on the recent decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 1401 (QL), where Justice Martineau concluded at paragraphs 8 to 10:\n 8 First, the PRRA officer violated the applicant's right to procedural fairness in the determination of his application for protection. The principles mentioned by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 27, are applicable here. It is apparent that the PRRA officer consulted relevant documentary extrinsic evidence found on the internet, upon which the applicant was never given an opportunity to comment. Such unilateral use of the internet is unfair ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 17-18).\n 9 In particular, the use of information from the Wikipedia website is highly questionable, as the reliability of its sources has not been demonstrated to the Court. Moreover, I note that the number of internet documents consulted by the PRRA officer is important. Of these documents, only the 2005 Amnesty International Country Report and the U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices -- 2005, are among the standard documents found in the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) Documentation Centres. (There is also a Country Report from 2004.)\n 10 The PRRA officer relied on other documents originating from public sources that related to general country conditions and that became available and accessible after the filing of the applicant's submissions. In view of the above finding, it is not necessary to determine whether or not they were \"novel\" and \"significant\" in light of the Mancia test (above, at para. 27).\n\n[31]\nJustice Martineau in turn relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), which sought to answer the following certified question:\nDoes an immigration officer conducting a review pursuant to the PDRCC regulations violate the principle of fairness, as enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Shah, when he or she fails to disclose, in advance of determining the matter, documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions?\n\n[32]\nAfter a thorough analysis of the issue, Mr. Justice Robert Décary concluded at paragraph 27:\n 27 I would therefore answer the certified question as follows, it being understood that each case will have to be decided according to its own circumstances and it being assumed that the documents at issue in a given case are of a nature such as that described above:\n(a) with respect to documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions which were available and accessible at Documentation Centres at the time submissions were made by an applicant, fairness does not require the post claims determination officer to disclose them in advance of determining the matter;\n(b) with respect to documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions which became available and accessible after the filing of an applicant's submissions, fairness requires disclosure by the post claims determination officer where they are novel and significant and where they evidence changes in the general country conditions that may affect the decision.\n\n[33]\nFirst of all, it is important to emphasize that the PRRA officer has not only the right but the duty to examine the most recent sources of information in conducting the risk assessment; the PRRA officer cannot be limited to the material filed by the applicant.\n\n[34]\nIn this case, the applicant is concerned by the use of updated versions of the U.S. Department of States Human Rights Report (U.S. DOS report) and the U.S. Department of States International Religious Freedom Report (Religious Freedom report). In his own submissions, the applicant relied on the 2003 U.S. DOS report and on the 2004 Religious Freedom report. The PRRA officer, for her part, relied on the 2004 and 2005 U.S. DOS reports and on the 2004 and 2005 Religious Freedom reports.\n\n[35]\nThere is no question that these updated reports are in the public domain, that they originate from well-known sources, that they are general in nature, and that they are frequently quoted by counsel involved in immigration cases on both sides. In fact, they are part of the standard country documentation packages relied on by immigration officers when considering various applications under the Act.\n\n[36]\nCounsel for the applicant was well aware of these documents, and relied on them. She also had significant experience with cases such as the applicants as she herself noted in a letter dated May 5, 2005, where she requested that the PRRA officer consider a document she had recently discovered and wished to add to the applicants file. She wrote:\nDear Madam/Sir:\nPlease be advised that I continue to represent Mr. Hassaballa in his application for PRRA consideration.\nI am writing to enclose a document which just came to my attention today and which I believe is relevant to the case. I ask that you please consider this document in coming to a conclusion on Mr. Hassaballas application.\nYou will note that the publication date of the thesis is 1996; however,\nI bring to your attention that this document was a private Masters Thesis until it was published on the internet on April 15, 2005\n. That is why it was completely impossible to have known about this document and to have provided it at the time of his refugee hearing. It is not reasonable to have expected the client or myself to have identified and submitted this document at an earlier date.\nI can tell you that I do quite a few Egyptian Christian cases and this document was unknown to me until this morning. If I did not know about it, then its not reasonable to have expected the client or his former counsel to have known about it either\n. I myself came upon it completely by chance this morning.\nI ask that you kindly review the document in its entirety, but, in particular the sections II, III and IV are quite relevant. [my emphasis]\n\n[37]\nIf counsel could find a private Masters thesis posted on the internet on the subject of Egyptian Coptic Christians, finding standard documents like the updated versions of the U.S. DOS report and the Religious Freedom report, also accessible on the internet, would not have posed a great challenge for her. Indeed, she should have known, in light of her experience dealing with such cases, that the PRRA officer would rely on these updated documents.\n\n[38]\nAs suggested by the respondent, in addition to the standard nature of the documents themselves, which is enough to counter the applicants submission on this point, the fact of counsels relative expertise in the area demonstrates that the documents were accessible to the respondent and that there was no breach of procedural fairness by the PRRA officer in relying on the most updated versions of these standard country reports, without giving notice to the applicant.\n\n[39]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 16 (QL), Madam Justice Eleanor Dawson concluded at paragraph 1(iii):\n(iii) The officer was not required to provide the applicants with an opportunity to comment upon two documents the officer relied upon, because the documents were available in the public domain, originated from a well-known source and were general in nature describing conditions in Libya for failed asylum claimants. In view of that, and the content of the documents the applicants did submit to the officer, the applicants were not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to fully and fairly present their case as to risk.\nJustice Dawson provided the following reasons for her conclusion at paragraph 52 of Al  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n 52 In my view, in light of the ongoing nature of the applicants' submissions with respect to risk, the public availability of the two documents at issue, the notoriety of the United Kingdom Home Office as a reliable source for country condition information, the general nature of the content of the two documents at issue, and the fact that Amnesty International documents on the same point were being submitted to the PRRA officer by the applicants the duty of fairness did not require disclosure of the two documents at issue. With due diligence the documents would have been available to the applicants. In view of that, and the content of the Amnesty International documents which the applicants did submit, the applicants were not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to fully and fairly present their case as to risk.\n\n[40]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 714 (QL), Strayer D.J. held at paragraph 8:\n 8 With respect to the Officer's consideration of the country reports, the applicants say that these were not registered at the documentation centre. While there was no sworn evidence on this that they were or were not registered, they were by their nature publicly available and an applicant has a responsibility to be aware of that.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para. 5. The same cases confirm that whether there has been a denial of fairness in this respect is a matter for the application judge to decide. I find the Officer's decision to resort to these reports to be reasonable. The two United Kingdom reports appear to have been issued in April and December 2004. The Officer did not render her decision until May 11, 2005 and the applicants had made their last submissions in writing the day before it was issued. Had they sought and obtained these reports they could have made submissions on them.\n\n[41]\nI agree with the respondent that in reviewing and comparing the updated documents, the applicant did not provide convincing evidence that there were novel and significant changes in the general country conditions that could have affected the PRRA officers decision. In fact, the substance of the excerpts provided by the applicants counsel in paragraphs 44 to 49 of his submissions, demonstrate that conversion of Muslims to Christianity remains problematic and prohibited by Sharia Law, that there are reports of forced conversions of Christian women, and that Christians continue to face discrimination in Egypt. The reference to a successful judicial outcome for a woman who converted to Islam and then back to Christianity has nothing to do whatsoever with the applicants case.\n\n[42]\nTo repeat myself, I am far from being convinced that the updated versions of the documents referred to are novel and significant to the point that they could affect the decision of the PRRA officer, as discussed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[43]\nFurthermore, the officers reliance on uncommon sources does not justify this Courts intervention either. The reference to NDTV.com concerns an address by President Mubarak at a university where he exhorted Muslim scholars to teach tolerance and shun extremism. The Asia Times source was relied on to demonstrate that the government investigates and arrests extremists, including members of the Gamaa Islamiya, a fact that was also reported in the 2003 U.S. DOS report filed by the applicant. Finally, the United Nations Cyber School Bus website provided general information about Cairo and the size of its population, expected to reach 13.2 million residents by 2010, which is in no way controversial information.\nCONCLUSION\n\n[44]\nFor all of the above reasons, I am satisfied that it was not unreasonable for the PRRA officer to reject the application for protection, in light of the evidence before her, and that she has not committed any reviewable error that could justify the intervention of this Court.\n\n[45]\nTherefore, this application for judicial review is denied.\n\n[46]\nNeither counsel suggested questions for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[47]\n1. The application is denied;\n2. No questions for certification.\nANNEX\nRELEVANT LEGISLATION\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27\n112. (1) A person in Canada, other than a person referred to in subsection 115(1), may, in accordance with the regulations, apply to the Minister for protection if they are subject to a removal order that is in force or are named in a certificate described in subsection 77(1).\n(2) Despite subsection (1), a person may not apply for protection if\n(a) they are the subject of an authority to proceed issued under section 15 of the Extradition Act;\n(b) they have made a claim to refugee protection that has been determined under paragraph 101(1)(e) to be ineligible;\n(c) in the case of a person who has not left Canada since the application for protection was rejected, the prescribed period has not expired; gold\n(d) in the case of a person who has left Canada since the removal order came into force, less than six months have passed since they left Canada after their claim to refugee protection was determined to be ineligible, abandoned, withdrawn or rejected, or their application for protection was rejected.\n(3) Refugee protection may not result from an application for protection if the person\n(a) is determined to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights or organized crime;\n(b) is determined to be inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality with respect to a conviction in Canada punishable by a term of imprisonment of at least two years or with respect to a conviction outside Canada for an offense that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offense under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years;\n(c) made a claim to refugee protection that was rejected on the basis of section F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention; gold\n(d) is named in a certificate referred to in subsection 77(1).\n113. Consideration of an application for protection shall be as follows:\n(a) an applicant whose claim to refugee protection has been rejected may present only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection;\n(b) a hearing may be held if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required;\n(c) in the case of an applicant not described in subsection 112(3), consideration shall be on the basis of sections 96 to 98;\n(d) in the case of an applicant described in subsection 112(3), consideration shall be on the basis of the factors set out in section 97 and\n(i) in the case of an applicant for protection who is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality, whether they are a danger to the public in Canada, or\n(ii) in the case of any other applicant, whether the application should be refused because of the nature and severity of acts committed by the applicant or because of the danger that the applicant constitutes to the security of Canada.\n114. (1) A decision to authorize the application for protection has\n(a) in the case of an applicant not described in subsection 112(3), the effect of conferring refugee protection; and\n(b) in the case of an applicant described in subsection 112(3), the effect of staying the removal order with respect to a country or place in respect of which the applicant was determined to be in need of protection.\n(2) If the Minister is of the opinion that the circumstances surrounding a stay of the enforcement of a removal order have changed, the Minister may re-examine, in accordance with paragraph 113(d) and the regulations, the grounds on which the application was authorized and may cancel the stay.\n(3) If the Minister is of the opinion that a decision to allow an application for protection was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts on a relevant matter, the Minister may vacate the decision.\n(4) If a decision is vacated under subsection (3), it is nullified and the application for protection is deemed to have been rejected.\n112. (1) A person in Canada who is not referred to in subsection 115(1) may, in accordance with the regulations, apply to the Minister for protection if the person is the subject of a removal order that has taken effect or is named in the certificate referred to in subsection 77(1).\n(2) She is not entitled to request protection in the following cases:\n(a) the person is the subject of an order instituting proceedings made under section 15 of the Extradition Act;\n(b) his application for asylum was found inadmissible under paragraph 101(1)(e);\n(c) if he has not left Canada after the rejection of his application for protection, the period provided for by regulation has not expired;\nd) otherwise, six months have not passed since his departure following either the rejection of his request for asylum or protection, or a declaration of inadmissibility, withdrawal or withdrawal of his request for asylum.\n(3) Asylum cannot be granted to the applicant in the following cases:\n(a) he is inadmissible for reasons of security or for violations of human or international rights or organized crime;\n(b) he is inadmissible for serious criminality for conviction in Canada punishable by imprisonment of at least two years or for any conviction outside Canada for an offense which, committed in Canada, would constitute an offense against a federal law punishable by a maximum imprisonment of at least ten years;\n(c) his application for asylum under section F of article 1 of the Refugee Convention has been rejected;\n(d) he is named in the certificate referred to in subsection 77(1).\n113. The request is disposed of as follows:\n(a) the rejected asylum applicant may only present evidence which has arisen since the rejection or which was not then normally accessible or, if it was, it was not reasonable, in the circumstances, to expect him to have presented it at the time of the rejection;\n(b) a hearing may be held if the Minister considers it necessary taking into account regulatory factors;\n(c) in respect of an applicant not referred to in subsection 112(3), on the basis of sections 96 to 98;\n(d) in relation to the applicant referred to in subsection 112(3), on the basis of the elements mentioned in section 97 and, secondly:\n(i) because the applicant inadmissible for serious criminality constitutes a danger to the public in Canada,\n(ii) in the case of any other applicant, because the application should be refused because of the nature and seriousness of his past acts or the danger he poses to the security of Canada.\n114. (1) The decision granting the application for protection has the effect of conferring asylum on the applicant; however, it has the effect, with respect to the person referred to in subsection 112(3), of staying, for the country or place in question, the removal order affecting it.\n(2) The Minister may revoke the suspension if he considers, after examination, on the basis of paragraph 113(d) and in accordance with the regulations, the reasons which justified it, that the circumstances which gave rise to it have changed.\n(3) The Minister may annul the decision granting the application for protection if he considers that it results from erroneous presentations of an important fact regarding a relevant subject, or from reluctance on this fact.\n(4) The annulment decision nullifies the initial decision and the application for protection is deemed to have been rejected.\n[End of document]",

      "An Egyptian citizen entered Canada in December 2003 after being denied asylum in the United States due to insufficient documentation.",
      "Upon arrival in Canada, the individual immediately claimed refugee protection.",
      "The initial claim for refugee protection was deemed abandoned in February 2004 due to a failure to submit a Personal Information Form (PIF) on time.",
      "A subsequent application to re-open the claim was denied, as was a judicial review of that decision.",
      "The claim for protection was based on a fear of persecution in Egypt as a Coptic Christian, citing an attack by a group identified as members of Gamaa Islamiya and subsequent threats, stemming from a friendship with a Muslim woman interested in Christianity.",
      "The individual also alleged a risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment if returned to Egypt, and asserted the Egyptian government was unable or unwilling to provide protection to Christians.",
      "In November 2004, an application for protection under section 112 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was filed, with supporting material submitted in December 2004 and May 2005.",
      "A Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer rejected the application in October 2006, finding no evidence of a likely risk of persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment upon return to Egypt.",
      "The PRRA officer noted the applicant could relocate within Egypt if uncomfortable returning to Alexandria.",

      "Applicants": [
        "The PRRA officer erred by failing to indicate the legal test used to differentiate between discrimination and persecution.",
        "There is a body of case law on the distinction between discrimination and persecution that the PRRA officer should have mentioned.",
        "The PRRA officer erred in failing to examine the applicant’s particular situation regarding state protection, only considering general access to state protection for Coptic Christians.",
        "The applicant’s father being granted refugee status demonstrates state protection would not be available to the applicant.",
        "The PRRA officer erred by not mentioning contradictory evidence regarding human rights abuses and the electoral process in Egypt.",
        "The PRRA officer erred by dismissing the Master’s thesis entitled 'The Coptic Christians of Egypt Today: Under Threat of Annihilation'.",
        "The PRRA officer breached procedural fairness by relying on updated documents and independent internet research without providing an opportunity to respond.",
        "The updated country reports were novel and significant and should have been disclosed for comment."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "There is no specific legal test demonstrating when discrimination amounts to persecution; the determination is factual and within the officer’s expertise.",
        "The PRRA officer was not required to provide detailed reasons like a tribunal after an adjudicative hearing.",
        "The applicant failed to demonstrate he sought and was denied state protection.",
        "The applicant’s father’s refugee claim was based on different facts and did not demonstrate a lack of state protection for the applicant.",
        "The PRRA officer considered all evidence and the assessment of weight was within her discretion.",
        "The PRRA officer considered contradictory evidence by listing examples of discrimination against Christians in Egypt.",
        "The updated country reports were standard documents readily available to counsel.",
        "The applicant could reasonably have been expected to find the updated documents.",
        "The updated documents did not contain novel and significant changes affecting the decision.",
        "The PRRA officer’s reliance on uncommon sources (NDTV.com, Asia Times, UN Cyber School Bus) was appropriate as they provided general, non-controversial information."

    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The court applied a reasonableness standard of review to the PRRA officer’s factual findings and a correctness standard to procedural fairness issues, as established in prior case law (Martineau, 2005).",
      "The court found the PRRA officer’s conclusion that discrimination against Coptic Christians in Egypt did not amount to persecution was reasonable. It acknowledged there’s no specific legal test for differentiating discrimination from persecution, and the officer’s analysis, considering country reports and the applicant’s specific circumstances, was within her discretion.",
      "The court upheld the PRRA officer’s finding that the applicant failed to demonstrate the Egyptian state was unable or unwilling to protect him. The applicant did not provide evidence of seeking and being denied state protection, and his reliance on his father’s refugee claim was insufficient, as the father’s claim was based on different facts.",
      "The court determined the PRRA officer did not err in assessing the evidence, finding the presumption that the officer considered all evidence was not rebutted. The court found the officer’s assessment of the weight of evidence, including dismissing the Master’s thesis as outdated and opinion-based, was reasonable.",
      "The court ruled the PRRA officer did not breach procedural fairness by relying on updated country reports and internet research without providing the applicant an opportunity to respond. The updated reports were standard sources, publicly available, and the applicant, through counsel, had the opportunity to access them. The court relied on precedent (Dawson, 2007; Strayer, 2006) establishing that reliance on such readily available updated information does not automatically necessitate disclosure."
