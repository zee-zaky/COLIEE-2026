    "[3]\nPrior to the hearing, the Board had advised the Applicant that identity would be an issue and had asked him to furnish his original Chinese Resident Identity Card (RIC), which he did.

      "The court found the Board’s decision to be procedurally unfair because the applicant was not given an opportunity to explain inconsistencies regarding his mother’s birthday, Hukou, and work record before the Board used those inconsistencies to question the authenticity of his Resident Identity Card (RIC). The court relied on established legal principle that applicants in immigration and refugee hearings must be given a chance to address contradictions.",
      "The court determined the Board’s conclusion that the RIC was fraudulent or fraudulently obtained was patently unreasonable. The Board never explicitly raised concerns about the RIC’s genuineness during the hearing, despite having received and initially verified the original document (noted as “OK” by the Refugee Protection Officer).",
      "The court found no logical connection between the inconsistencies in the applicant’s testimony regarding his mother’s birthday, Hukou, and work record, and the authenticity of the RIC. The Board’s reliance on the possibility of fraudulent cards in circulation, without any specific evidence regarding the applicant’s card, was deemed insufficient.",
      "The court applied the standard of review of 'patent unreasonableness' to the Board’s assessment of the identity document, and concluded the Board’s reasoning fell below that standard due to the lack of opportunity for the applicant to respond and the absence of a logical link between the evidence and the conclusion."
