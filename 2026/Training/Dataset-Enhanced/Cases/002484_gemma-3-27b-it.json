    "[1]\nMuldoon, J.\n: The applicant's solicitors made an omelette of this, and eight parallel applications, which was largely unscrambled by order, dated May 29, 1991, pronounced by Mr. Justice Rouleau. Thus, these reasons will apply additionally to four concurrent trademark applications before the respondent Board brought before this court in four other proceedings, each finally with its own file and suit number, and four others with other respondents.",
    "[2]\nAccording to the originating notice made to serve for this particular proceeding the applicant seeks:\n\"... the issuance of writs of certiorari and mandamus, or orders in the nature thereof, against the Registrar of Trademarks Opposition Board, pursuant to s. 18 ... setting aside the refusal of the Opposition Board to permit certain amendments to CPC's statements of opposition herein, and directing the Registrar and his delegate, the Opposition Board, to permit CPC, pursuant to Trademarks Regulation 42, to allow the said amendments, the said amendments having been refused by the Opposition Board on February 28, 1991.\n\"The grounds of the motions are that the Opposition Board, in refusing the amendments, erred in fact and in law, and proceeded on wrong principles, as follows:\n(a) erred in concluding that there would be prejudice to the respondents in allowing the amendments;\n(b) erred in overlooking the prejudice to CPC in refusing the amendments;\n(c) erred in concluding that the amendments would give rise to delay;\n(d) erred in giving weight to CPC's delay in seeking the amendments;\n(e) erred in law in concluding that certain of the amendments sought did not have merit;\n(f) erred in failing to consider and apply the well-established criteria in relation to permitting amendments to pleadings.\n\"The following documentary evidence will be presented: evidence regarding the proceedings before the Opposition Board in relation to the refused amendments, namely, the affidavit of Michael D. Manson, sworn June 18, 1991.\"",
    "[3]\nAs is apparent from the said supporting affidavit, and emphasized by the exhibits thereto, it is virtually impossible to describe and adjudicate the issues herein without making reference to the professional ineptitude of the applicant's solicitors. That melancholy matter forms the raison d'être of these originating motions. Notable are paragraphs 6(a), (b) and (c) of Michael D. Manson's affidavit, in which he avers that the applicant's solicitors had either completely overlooked or quite misapprehended the significance of the following important jurisprudence:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M.O.B.);\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Que. S.C.); and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 161 (F.C.A.).",
    "[4]\nOn August 29, 1990, the applicant's solicitors wrote to the Registrar of Trademarks a letter, copied to the private respondent's solicitors, in which they indicated that the Canada Post Corporation (hereinafter: Can. Post) was seeking leave to amend further the statement of opposition against the respondent's trademark application which Can. Post had effected on September 2, 1988, and already amended a first time on April 25, 1989. Pertinent passages of that request to amend run thus:\n\"The opponent's [i.e. Can. Post's] proposed amendments in new paragraph (c) of the amended statement of opposition has [sic] been prompted by the decision\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  58 of the\nPostal Act\nand s. 9(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. He stated that the prohibition in s. 58(2) was of a lower order than the test of either deception or confusion and was in fact a test of 'suggesting' and held that use by the defendants of the word 'post' in their respective corporate names and on their stamps and elsewhere in their operations constituted a violation of the provisions of s. 58 of the\nPostal Act\n. He stated at page 224 of the reported decision:\n'If in this country as throughout the world, words like \"mail\", \"post\" and \"post office\" have in the experience of all, been associated with the only postal system we have ever known, how can one conclude otherwise than by affirming that the use of the words \"post\" and \"post office\", \"suggest\" that that which is prohibited in subsections [sic] (a), (b) and (c) of s. 58(2)?'\n\"This decision only very recently came to the attention of the agents for the opponent, since the opponent did not appreciate its possible significance in an opposition proceeding. Having regard to this decision, applicant seeks to amend the statement of opposition to insert new paragraph 1(c).\n\"The opponent as well seeks to amend the ... opposition by inserting subparagraph (g), which deals with the prohibition afforded by s. 9(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. The opponent's agent only became aware of the possibility of asserting this ground of opposition very recently as a result of the reported decision of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As well, the principals of the opponent who instruct the opponent's agent in respect of this opposition were also not aware of this decision until very recently. Accordingly, the opponent seeks to insert this ground of opposition in order to have all relevant grounds of opposition before the hearing officer.\n\"The opponent also seeks to amend the statement of opposition by amending subparagraphs (e) and (f) to include additional s. 9 marks in respect of which public notice has been given. This amendment is made having regard to the recent and very significant decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, it was held that the prohibition against registration under subsection 12(1)(e) applies to any trademark which has not yet been registered on the date of publication of an official mark. The opponent seeks to insert all the s. 9 marks owned by the opponent which have been published to date and which are relevant to this opposition.\n\"The opponent further seeks to amend subparagraph (c) (new subparagraph (d)) of the statement of opposition to refer to the fact that the applications for the trademark Mail Poste and Poste Mail & Designs were registered on October 27, 1989 as registration Nos. TMA 361,467 and TMA 361,468, respectively. While the decision in the\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wording is identical. In other words, the prohibitions of paragraphs (d) and (e) are the same; both of which speak in terms of the present. It is submitted that it is impossible for the decision in the\nAllied\ncase to be correct with reference to paragraph (e) of the\nTrade Marks Act\nwithout the same principle being applicable to paragraph (d).\n\"Thus, it is submitted that the\nAllied\ndecision has, in effect, restored the decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\nAllied\ndecisions are consistent with another decision of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which it was held that the date of decision is the material date, but the issue was not discussed at any length.\n\"None of the amendments give [sic] rise to any need for additional evidence on behalf of the opponent. We would not oppose any request by the applicant to file new evidence in relation to the new issues.\n\"Accordingly, it is requested that leave be granted to make the appropriate amendments. It is submitted that these amendments to the statement of opposition are necessary to ensure that all issues are before the Opposition Board for consideration in rendering its decision in respect of this matter.\n\"Finally, it is also requested that the opponent be granted an extension of four months in which to file its reply evidence in respect of this opposition. This additional time is required because of the complexity of these proceedings. Furthermore, having regard to the above request for leave to amend the statement of opposition, it is respectfully submitted that the request for the extension of time in which to file the reply evidence is reasonable and warranted. Our cheque of today's date includes the prescribed $50 government fee.\"",
    "[5]\nThe solicitors for the private respondent (the trademark applicant) objected vigorously to Can. Post's request to amend its statement of opposition. They wrote to the Registrar of Trademarks on October 2, 1990, and made these objections, among others:\n\"... The fact that the background research conducted by the agents for the opponent at the time the Statement of Opposition and Amended Statement of Opposition were prepared and filed was incomplete does not constitute a valid basis upon which to base a request for leave to amend a pleading, particularly at this late stage in the proceedings after both parties have filed their evidence.\n\"It is also our submission that the new ground of opposition proposed to be relied upon in new paragraph 1(c) of the Amended Statement of Opposition is without merit. The Trademarks Opposition Board has in a number of past decisions rendered in the past made it clear that the possibility that an applicant's use of a mark sought to be registered may contravene some other statute is not relevant in opposition proceedings.\n. . . . .\n\"... The ground of opposition proposed to be introduced has been available to the opponent from the outset of these proceedings. The only basis which the agents for the opponent have offered to support their request for leave to amend to add a ground of opposition based on s. 9(1)(d) is the fact that the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  submission that this decision failed to break any new ground and did not recognize a ground of opposition which was previously unavailable. The fact that the research conducted by the agents for the opponents was incomplete or that their instructing principals failed to advise them to rely on this ground of opposition should not be considered by the Registrar to justify the request for leave to further amend the Amended Statement of Opposition at this stage.\n. . . . .\n\"... [T]he agents for the opponent have failed to set forth\nany\ngrounds to properly support ... leave to amend paragraphs 1(e) and 1(f) to refer to additional marks ... previously used ... and additional marks which are the subject of s. 9 protection.\n. . . . .\n\"... We are also surprised that the agents for the opponent have attempted to justify the proposed amendments on the basis of the decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . This decision was rendered well before the opponent's Amended Statement of Opposition was filed and does not, in our view, give rise to a ground of opposition that was previously unavailable to the opponent. ... [T]he agents for the opponent have to provide an appropriate excuse to explain why reference to these additional marks were [sic] not, or could not be possibly have been, included in the Statement of Opposition as originally filed or as amended on April 25, 1989. Further, the applicant's evidence was formulated and filed on the basis of the pleadings. We respectfully submit that it would be highly prejudicial to the applicant's case to permit the proposed amendments to be introduced at this late date.\n. . . . .\n\"... [T]he amendment which the opponent proposes to make to subparagraph (d) to refer to the fact that the applicant's applications for 'Mail Poste' and 'Poste Mail & Design' have issued to registration is redundant and adds no new ground of opposition.\n. . . . .\n\"The agents for the opponent have also requested an extension of time within which to file reply evidence. ... [T]he grant of a further extension of time is not justified as the opponent has already had ample time to prepare its evidence. We also submit that the agents for the opponent have failed to provide any reasons which properly support the grant of the extension requested.\"",
    "[6]\nThe impugned decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board, (hereinafter: TMOB), dated February 28, 1991, in its pertinent passages, runs as follows:\n\"... [A]llowing the opponent to effect any of the desired revisions to the statement of opposition would result in prejudice to the applicant. [The private respondent herein.] There would be additional delay in this proceeding, the applicant would be obliged to answer the new grounds of opposition and the applicant might have to file additional evidence. Furthermore, the opponent has not given entirely satisfactory reasons as to why leave was not sought much earlier respecting many of the desired revisions to the statement of opposition.\n\"As for proposed new paragraphs 1(c) and 1(g) of the statement of opposition, these proposed grounds of opposition were available to the opponent from the outset. The same observation applies to the revisions sought to be made to new paragraph 1(e).\n\"The opponent is also seeking to revise new paragraph 1(d) to include reference to the registrations issuing from the two applications referred to in that paragraph. Although it is not apparent from a reading of new paragraph 1(d), it would appear from the opponent's letter of August 29 that it is seeking to rely on these two registrations in support of a ground of opposition pursuant to s. 12(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. However, the material time for considering the circumstances respecting such a ground is as of the filing of the opposition. Consequently, the opponent is precluded from relying on subsequently issued registrations.\n\"Most of the additional official marks sought to be added to paragraph 1(f) were published well before the commencement of the present opposition. Thus, it is not seen how the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the\nAllied\ncase relied on by the opponent justifies the addition of these additional official marks. It does, however, provide justification for the addition of the final five official marks listed in paragraph 1(f) of the proposed revised statement of opposition since notice of those five marks was only given in 1989.\n\"In view of the above, the opponent is hereby granted leave pursuant to rule 42 to include reliance on the final five official marks listed in paragraph 1(f) of the proposed revised statement of opposition. The opponent's rule 42 request is otherwise refused. Consequently, the opponent will have one month from the date of this letter within which to file and serve a revised statement of opposition in accordance with today's grant of leave.\"",
    "[7]\nCan. Post's amended statement of opposition, contained a passage designated 1(f) which made no reference to s. 9 or to s. 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, and listed no official marks of which public notice had been given in the\nTrade Marks Journal\n. (Can. Post's motion record: p. 000115-16.) The paragraph designated 1(f) in the Can. Post's impugned statement of opposition, however, including the significant last five official marks therein listed, runs thus:\n\"1(f) The proposed trademark is not registrable because, contrary to paragraph 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, it is a mark the adoption of which is prohibited by s. 9 of the\nAct\n, in that it so nearly resembles that it is likely to be mistaken for the following official marks, public notice of which was given in the following issues of the\nTrade Marks Journal\n:\nOfficial Mark\nNumber\nNotice Date\nPriority Post - Poste Prioritaires\n900,671\nMay 1978\nIntelpost\n900,673\nApril 15, 1981\nAdmail\n900,674\nMay 20, 1981\nMediaposte & Design\n900,675\nFebruary 10, 1982\nAdmail & Design\n900,676\nApril 28, 1982\nMediaposte\n900,677\nFebruary 26, 1982\nElectronic Mail Courrier Electronique & Design\n900,678\nDecember 14, 1983\nCourrier Electronique\n900,679\nFebruary 22, 1984\nElectronic Mail\n900,680\nFebruary 22, 1984\nMailtrac\n900,681\nMay 2, 1984\nMessageries Poste Prioritaire\n900,682\nFebruary 2, 1984\nPriority Post Courier\n900,683\nFebruary 2, 1984\nSupermailbox\n903,039\nNovember 25, 1987\nMail Poste & Design\n903,803\nMarch 30, 1989\nPoste Mail & Design\n903,806\nMarch 30, 1989\nPoste Mail & Design\n903,807\nMarch 30, 1989\nPriority Courier\n903,973\nDecember 6, 1989\nMessageries Prioritaires\n903,974\nDecember 6, 1989\"",
    "[8]\nThe other proposed amendments rejected by the TMOB, are new paragraphs 1(c), (d), (e) and (g). They run as follows:\n\"(c) If the applicant uses the proposed trademark in association with the services set out in applicant's application, it would suggest that the use of such services has been authorized or approved by the opponent, or that such services are used in the business of the opponent, or that such services are of a kind similar or identical to services used in the business of the opponent. Such use would be without the written consent of the opponent and would be contrary to the provisions of the aforesaid\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, ss. 58(1) and (2). Accordingly, the application does not comply with s. 30(i) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, because the applicant could not, at the date of filing of the application, have been satisfied that it was entitled to use the trademark in Canada, since such use would be unlawful.\n\"(d) The applicant is not the person entitled to registration because, at the date of filing of the application, the applicant's trademark was confusing with the trademarks Mail Poste and Poste Mail & Designs, in respect of which applications for registration, Nos. 577,188 and 577,189, had been previously (on January 30, 1987) filed in Canada by the opponent, and which were pending at the date of advertisement of the applicant's application. These said applications were registered on October 27, 1989 as registration Nos. TMA 361,467 and TMA 361,468, respectively.\n\"(e) The applicant is not the person entitled to registration of the trademark because, at the date of filing of the application, it was confusing with the trademarks and trade names Canada Post Corporation, Canada Post and Post Office, Admail, Courrier Electronique, Electronic Mail Courrier Electronique & Design, Electronic Mail, Intelpost, Mailtrac, Mediaposte & Design, Mediaposte, Supermailbox, Mail Poste & Design, Poste Mail & Design, Priority Post, Postes Prioritaires, Messageries Poste Prioritaire, Priority Post Courier, Priority Courier and Messageries Prioritaires, all of which had been previously used in Canada by the opponent and/or its predecessor, Her Majesty in Right of Canada, acting as The Post Office Department.\n. . . . .\n\"(g) The trademark is not registrable, because contrary to paragraph 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, it is a mark the adoption of which is prohibited by s. 9(1)(d) of the\nAct\n, having regard to the aforesaid official marks, trademarks and trade names of the opponent, the applicant's trademark is likely to lead to the belief that services in associations with which it is proposed to be used have received or are produced, sold or performed under governmental patronage, approval or authority.\"",
    "[9]\nThere are proposed certain internal amendments to correct paragraph 1(i) of the opposition statement which is now proposed to appear as follows:\n\"(i) The opponent had not abandoned any of the trademarks, official marks and trade names referred to above at the date of advertisement of the applicant's application.\"",
    "[10]\nOn the issue of prejudice, if any, which may be suffered by the respective parties, it is true that this litigation does create some delay. However, at the best of times trademark opposition proceedings do not operate with vertiginous alacrity and since that seems to be nobody's fault, it is just accepted. In this regard, the court accepts the applicant's counsel's arguments to the effect that no prejudice can truly be alleged in that no witness has died leaving potential testimony unrecorded, no document has been lost and no respondent's mark has been infringed. In such circumstances prima facie valid amendments of the statement of opposition ought to be permitted. There would, however, arise serious prejudice to Can. Post if it were forever foreclosed from having its full opposition adjudicated only because of its solicitors' seeming somnolence.",
    "[11]\nCan. Post's counsel indicated, with great satisfaction and hope, the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board in application no. 593,671 for the trademark \"Datamail Canada\", filed by 690062 Ontario Limited. The decision is dated June 28, 1991. Can. Post is alleged to have prevailed on the merits, but the one-person opposition board wrote, at page 5 of the decision:\n\"The applicant [i.e. 690062 Ontario Limited] did not file evidence in support of its application. Both parties filed written arguments. The applicant's written argument is very brief. [Not an inherent fault!], and merely reiterates the denials and assertions in the counter statement. Only the opponent was represented at an oral hearing.\"\nAnd further it is stated on p. 7:\n\"Having regard to the above, I am satisfied that the opponent has adduced sufficient evidence to at least meet its initial burden with respect to supporting its ground of opposition that the applied for mark is not distinctive of the applicant's services.\n\"Considering that the applicant has not filed any evidence in support of its application, and that its written argument is not persuasive, I find that the applicant has not met the legal burden on it to establish that the applied for mark is distinctive of the applicant at the material date January 9, 1989. The opponent therefore succeeds on its ground of opposition denoted by 1(h). Consequently, the remaining grounds of opposition need not be considered.\n\"In view of the above, the applicant's application is refused.\"",
    "[12]\nThat disposition was not so much a prevailing on the merits on Can. Post's part as a prevailing almost by default. So it was, it seems, in regard to Can. Post's obtaining permission twice to amend its statement of opposition. The trademark applicant in that case never did object to such amendments. In the present circumstances, the significance of the \"Datamail Canada\" decision is not so great as counsel has urged.",
    "[13]\nOf considerably, if not crucially, greater significance in this case is the judgment of Halperin, J., of the Quebec Superior Court in\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  'mail', 'post' and 'post office' have in the experience of all, been associated with the only postal system we have ever known, [so] how can one conclude otherwise than by affirming that the use of [such] words ... 'suggest' that which is prohibited in subsections [sic] (a), (b) and (c) of s. 58(2)\" [of the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 54, now R.S.C. 1985, c. C-10]? The statement of opposition clearly ought to contain the reference to s. 58(1) and (2) of the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n(hereinafter\nC.P.C.A.\n) as expressed in paragraph 1(c) which the opponent seeks to emplace therein by means of the amendment which the opposition board has rejected. It ought to contain it, no matter the duration of time in which the opponent's solicitors were asleep on the job.",
    "[14]\nJolted awake also by their discovery of the opposition board member's 1990 decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  statement by inserting paragraph 1(g), and rightly so. Paragraph 1(g) is important in regard to the adoption of the official marks of which public notice has been given in the\nTrade Marks Journal\n, especially Supermailbox, No. 903-039, whose notice date was November 25, 1987. Paragraph 1(g) simply ought to be included in the opposition statement of this particular opponent, Can. Post, despite the length of time in which its solicitors were asleep on the job.",
    "[15]\nInasmuch as the opposition board in deciding\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  therefore gave utterly no consideration or effect to ss. 5(2)(e) and 19(1)(r), and ss. 23, 25, 56, 58 and 61 thereof, then that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case is wrongly decided. The TMOB has no right or jurisdiction simply to blink away solemnly enacted, statutory statements of public policy made by parliament in regard to the very subject before the board. The Registrar and the TMOB, like the Sovereign or like this court, are not above the law.",
    "[16]\nThe 1989 judgment of this court's appeal division in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  apparently dark sky of consciousness. It surely supports the proposed content configuration of paragraphs 1(e) and (f) as they are proposed by the opponent's solicitors. Such matters require the interpretation of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10, and of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, imported by Mr. Justice MacGuigan for a unanimous panel of the appeal division in December 1989. Consideration of the content of paragraphs 1(e) and (f) in the statement of opposition is (and always was) exacted by the virtually unique status of Can. Post, a public authority with its own statutory trademark protection over and above that which it may also invoke under the\nTrade Marks Act\n. Because of that virtually unique statutory status, Can. Post cannot logically suffer erosion of its paramount status under and by virtue of merely adjectival provisions in the\nTrade Marks Act\n. The provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\nmust be taken to be buttressed by the substantive provisions of the\nTrade Marks Act\nand must be respected as the authentic will of parliament in this regard.",
    "[17]\nAs noted, although the respondent herein generally alleges prejudice if the Can. Post's proposed amendments be permitted, no specific prejudice is demonstrated, apart from the effluxion of time, and the lack of compensatory costs in the opposition proceedings. If there be one sure aspect of opposition proceedings it is that they seem to take a long time, in any event, from whatever cause amply justifiable or otherwise. However the respondent's plight is not so terrible as its counsel would have the court believe, simply because in such proceeding the Registrar of Trademarks cannot award costs for or against any party in any event. That is not to say that this court is powerless to award costs in these proceedings, a matter to which the court will return later herein.",
    "[18]\nThe salient feature of Can. Post, its opposition to the respondent's trademark applications, and its appeal for permission to make even a second round of significant amendments to its opposition it its paramount statutory status, conferred by the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n. This factor pervades any and all cases in which Can. Post is involved in a trademark application or opposition. It is a matter of public policy and public order, which the TMOB is bound to respect.",
    "[19]\nLeaving aside for the moment those matters of public policy and public order emanating from Can. Post's special statutory status in regard to maintaining its corporate identity as an institution of the government of Canada, and as an agent of the Crown in right of Canada, one may find support for Can. Post's posture herein in ordinary jurisprudence applicable to ordinary litigants. Such support resides in the principles stated by the jurisprudence cited by Can. Post's counsel.",
    "[20]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Teitelbaum of this court, as reported, wrote:\n\"The courts should not intervene in the discretionary powers of the Registrar of Trademarks as given to him by the\nAct\nunless\nhe is clearly acting outside his jurisdiction or\nhe is\nacting '\nclearly wrong\nhaving regard to the facts'.\n\"This principle was enunciated by Mr. Justice Heald in the case of\nCentennial Grocery Brokers Ltd.\n[(1972), 5 C.P.R.(2d) 235, [1972] F.C. 257], at p. 239 C.P.R., p. 261 F.C., where Heald, J., states:\n'I should not interfere with the Registrar's exercise of discretion unless he was clearly wrong and I am not prepared to say that he was clearly wrong having regard to the facts in this case.'\n\"I do believe that the registrar was 'clearly wrong' in asking for further clarification of the reasons for the requested extension.\n\"The affidavit submitted on behalf of the respondent, the affidavit of Alan M. Troicuk dated April 8, 1986, states what the current practice of the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs is with regard to such applications.\n\"Paragraph 4 of the affidavit states what the procedure is:\n'It is also the practice of the Trademarks Office to consider up to the time of allowance any request for a retroactive extension of time under s. 46(2) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. If material initially filed with the request is insufficient, the practice is to advise the requesting party of the statutory requirements for an extension and to ask the party to address these statutory requirements by way of an additional submission, which submission must be filed within a certain time frame.'\n\"It seems to me that this practice is ultimately fair. A person who may wish to oppose a trademark should be given every\nreasonable\nopportunity to do so within the confines of the\nAct\n.\" (Emphasis not in original text)",
    "[21]\nAccording to Mr. Justice Collier's judgment reported as\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 458, the Registrar's decision \"must be on proper legal principles, and in the interests of justice between the parties\"; but the court can interfere \"if it appears he [the Registrar or the TMOB] has proceeded upon improper or erroneous principles or\noverlooked an important matter\n\" (emphasis not in original text). Collier, J., was there considering the dispute of two wholly private litigants and not even one endowed with special statutory status which is of course \"an important matter\" not to be overlooked in cases like this one.",
    "[22]\nSo also stated Mr. Justice Dubé of this court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), thus:\n\"Again it is not for the court to substitute its own decision to that of the Registrar. The court may only move and exercise its own discretion where all the facts were not before the Registrar, or\nwhere he did not take into account all the relevant factors\n, or where there is an error of fact or of law on the face of the record, or where procedural irregularities may have influenced the final determination of the decision, or where a decision is scandalous, or frivolous, or bereft of any sound or objective motive.\" (He cited much jurisprudence in support.)",
    "[23]\nHere was a case of a private opponent, without any special status, par excellence, for Dubé, J., noted at the end of his reasons:\n\"The crux of the argument of the appellant is that it is not reasonable to require 'small and unsophisticated' companies to subscribe to the\nTrade Marks Journal\nor to engage a trademark agent to review the\nTrade Marks Journal\non their behalf. Obviously, that argument has no merit. A notice in the\nTrade Marks Journal\nis proper, legal notice to the world. The Registrar cannot be expected to grant special dispenses to small and unsophisticated companies. Indeed, such an exercise of discretion on his part would be quickly challenged by those who have acted in a timely fashion in accordance with the\nAct\n.\"\nIngredients there, were not present in the case at bar: here, \"taking into account all the relevant factors\", must include respecting Can. Post's special statutory status, a status of which Kitchen Craft Connection Inc. could not boast, leaving it bereft in the circumstances, for the same stated principles apply here as well as there, even although the facts and factors differ.",
    "[24]\nSo it is, in consonance with the pervasive principle, the court must ask: \"Did the Registrar err in law or apply any wrong principle?\" as stated by Mr. Justice Mahoney in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at p. 56 for a unanimous Appeal Division of this court. There was a case establishing that whether or not to grant an extension of time to an ordinary opponent under s. 46 of the\nAct\nis very much a matter of the Registrar's discretion. The opponent there, Star-Kist, was very much an ordinary opponent without special statutory status.",
    "[25]\nIt is quite apparent that while the principle is constant the facts and factors may vary so markedly as to produce entirely opposite conclusions. Thus, Mr. Justice Rouleau, whose decision in\nStar-Kist\nwas unanimously upheld by the Appeal Division, came to an opposite conclusion in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 7 F.T.R. 149 (F.C.T.D.), at p. 130 where he is reported to have written:\n\"In situations where discretionary powers are exercised without having regard to all relevant facts or where there may be an error on the face of the record, or there exists a procedural irregularity which eventually had an influence on the final determination made by the decision-maker, the exercise of that discretion should be subject to review by the court in its supervisory capacity.\nIf the disregard for the facts\nor the overlooking of some procedure\nwas a relative factor in determining the outcome\n, the court should exercise its discretion and set aside the decision or order.\" (Emphasis not in original text)\nAlways, due attention to, and respect for, the facts and factors are essential to the orientation of the outcome, even between ordinary litigants, for the operation of the principle remains constant. Different circumstances in the constant principle's operation will dictate different outcomes. In this case, the circumstances dictate the success of this motion and permission once again, to amend the statement of opposition, as Can. Post proposes.",
    "[26]\nWhat is so out-of-the-ordinary, so special is, as previously above mentioned, Can. Post's special statutory status. It is described in the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, above cited (and hereinafter cited R.S.C. 1985, c. C-10). The provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\naffect and augment Can. Post's status of opponent in trademark proceedings, because the right of corporate identity pervades Can. Post's special monopolistic status. That places it in a more favourable position than that of ordinary parties to such proceedings.",
    "[27]\nHere are some salient, pertinent provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, viewed apart from the overall scope of status and recognition carved for Can. Post generally by the very existence of the\nAct\n. Emphasis is added.\n\"2(1) In this Act,\n. . . . .\n'\nCorporation\n' means the Canada\nPost\nCorporation established by s. 4;\n'\nmail\n' [the noun, not the verb] means\nmailable matter\nfrom the time it is posted to the time it is delivered to the addressee thereof;\n'\nmail bag\n' means any container or covering in which mail is transmitted, whether it contains\nmail\nor not;\n'\nmail contractor\n' means a person who has entered into a contract with the Corporation for the\ntransmission of mail\n, which contract has not expired or been terminated;\n'\nmail conveyance\n' means any physical, electronic, optical or other means used to transmit mail;\n'\nmailable matter\n' means any message, information, funds or goods that may be transmitted by\npost\n; [the noun, not the verb]\n. . . . .\n'\npost\n' [the verb, not the noun] means to leave in a\npost office\nor with a person authorized by the Corporation to receive mailable matter;\n'\npost office\n' includes any place, receptacle, device or mail conveyance authorized by the Corporation for the\nposting\n[the verb's gerund], receipt, sorting, handling, transmission or delivery of mail;\n'\npostage\n' means the charge or surcharge payable for the collection, transmission and delivery by the Corporation of messages, information, funds or goods and for insurance or other special services provided by the Corporation in relation thereto;\n'\npostage stamp\n' means any stamp, postage impression or postage meter impression authorized by the Corporation for the purpose of paying postage;\n'\npostage remittance\n' means any instrument authorized by the Corporation for the remittance of funds;\n. . . . .\n'\ntransmit\n' means to send or convey from one place to another place by any physical, electronic, optical or other means;\n'\ntransmit by post\n' [the noun] means to transmit through or by means of the Corporation.\n. . . . .\n\"(2) For the purposes of this Act,\n(a) leaving\nmail\nat the place of residence or business of the addressee thereof,\n(b) depositing\nmail\nin a\npost office\nlock box or rural mail box or any other receptacle or device provided for the receipt of\nmail\nof the addressee, or\n(c)\nleaving mail\nwith the addressee or his servant or agent or with any other person who may reasonably be considered to be authorized to receive\nmail\nby the addressee thereof,\naccording to the usual manner of delivering\nmail\nto that addressee, is deemed to be delivery to the addressee.\n\"(3) For the purposes of this Act, a thing is deemed to be in the course of\npost\nfrom the time it is posted to the time it is delivered to the addressee or returned to the sender thereof.\n\"3.

    "[28]\nThe applicant is a very special entity enjoying a very special status accorded by parliament, of which the TMOB is bound to take notice. That special legislated status refers to Can. Post's corporate identity, the monopoly accorded to it in any word or mark suggesting its activities, and the penal consequences to be inflicted on anyone who violates or infringes upon that monopoly.",
    "[29]\nThe incidents of parliament's special regard for, and statutory protection of Can. Post abound in the\nC.P.C.A.\nand are especially noticeable in the above recited passages. The definitions, especially those of \"mail\", \"mailable matter\" and \"transmit by post\", virtually equate Can. Post with the notions of \"mail or mailing\" and \"post or posting\" of \"any message, information, funds or goods which may be transmitted by post\". These are matters of public policy and public order, because parliament enacted that the\nC.P.C.A.\n\"is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province\". It is a primary statutory mandate of Can. Post to establish and operate a postal service, and it enjoys, also by statute the sole and exclusive privilege of collecting, transmitting and delivering letters in Canada. In the English-language version of s. 5(2) of the\nAct\n, the desirability and the need of certain activities are delineated; but the maintenance of a corporate identity program is legislated as a\nneed\nof this corporation Canada Post, which is an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada, and which is so durable that it cannot be wound up, unless parliament makes special provision.",
    "[30]\nEven if the issues in this case were being litigated by two wholly private contenders for the property rights accorded by a trademark, even without Can. Post on one side, it would transpire that the appropriate date for consideration of the grounds of opposition pursuant to s. 12(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\nwould be the date upon which the TMOB, delegated by the Registrar, disposed of the opposition on the evidence adduced, That day has not yet dawned. Such principle was enunciated in the recent unanimous decision of this court's Appeal Division, written by Madam Justice Desjardins for release on June 24, 1991, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). This case supports Can. Post's position that the TMOB erred in law in refusing the amendment whereby the applicant (Can. Post) sought to rely on s. 9 marks and registered trademarks of Can. Post which were published and registered respectively, after the date of filing of the opposition. Indeed, this tolls as an error in law underlying the decision attached herein. It certainly so tolls in regard to Can. Post's special status.",
    "[31]\nIn terms of Can. Post's monopoly and identity, ss. 58, 60 and 61 of the\nAct\ndemonstrate how parliament cherishes, protects and cossets Can. Post, to the extent of criminalizing any activities which falsely proclaim \"post office\" or merely suggest, by any word or mark, that they operate as if approved by the corporation or use things similar to that which it uses in its business. Criminal sanctions are the State's heavy artillery, especially when prosecutable on indictment as potentially are the hybrid offences denounced in s. 60 of the\nC.P.C.A.\nThese, too, are matters of public policy and public order. In that regard the Registrar of Trademarks, and his delegate the TMOB, must understand or be made to realize that they, in common with everyone else, cannot lawfully authorize anyone, including anyone to whom they would issue a trademark, to commit a criminal offence by such means. An issued trademark does not operate to excuse conduct made criminal by the\nC.P.C.A.",
    "[32]\nPublic policy surely overrides all private individuals' or corporations' claimed proprietary interest in a trademark, as a matter of public order. In regard to statutory interpretation, then, the\nC.P.C.A.\non its plane of public policy cannot be held to be useless and fruitless legislation:\nInutilis labor et sine fructus non est effectus legis\n; or, more concisely received from ancient principle:\nLex nil frustra facit\n, meaning that the protection provided to Can. Post cannot be taken to have been enacted in vain.",
    "[33]\nIn light of Can. Post's extraordinarily special status conferred by parliament, the corporation cannot lawfully be prevented, on the TMOB's discretion under the rules, from evincing all of its enormous statutory importance in specific regard to Can. Post's marks and words of corporate identity, by refusing the amendments to its statement of opposition just as if Can. Post were an ordinary individual or corporation. Put another way, the law exacts that Can. Post be enabled to evince its special status regarding it corporate identity in order that the TMOB have fully for consideration Can. Post's exertion of its monopoly, status and identity in opposition to anyone and everyone who or which would seek to become the registered holder of trademarks similar to, or even suggesting those of Can. Post, for such marks fall under the ban of outlawry imposed by the specific and general provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n.",
    "[34]\nIndeed, it is the lawful duty of Can. Post, in regard to the statutory\nneed to maintain a corporate identity program\n, expressed in s. 5(2) of the\nAct\n, to defend and to assert its monopoly in its trademarks, interests and trademark oppositions. This is clearly so, even if its solicitors were asleep on the job, for their dilatoriness cannot conceivably override the plain imperatives of public order and public policy enunciated in the above cited provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, unless the statute so conceded, that which it does not do.",
    "[35]\nStatutes of public order are most relevantly considered, albeit from a different base of view, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> where at page 19 Mr. Justice Taschereau is reported as having written about the\nArchitects' law\n, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 272:\n\"This law is not only a law of public order, but it is also a prohibitive law carrying a penalty. It is not necessary, I believe, to write a long dissertation to demonstrate that in principle laws of this type entail nullity even though it is not declared there. (C.C. 14) (Mignault, vol. 1, p. 123.) The defendant could obviously invoke this nullity and have it noted by the courts.\"\nSo it is also with the\nC.P.C.A.\n, a statute of public order which also carries prohibitions of breaches of its provisions under pain of penalties. The TMOB simply must take respectful notice of that statute. Not to do so is an error in law.",
    "[36]\nThus, the tardiness in expressing grounds of opposition which could foreclose an ordinary opponent, simply cannot prevail against Can. Post, which, by virtue of the explicit and implicit imperatives of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, must be accorded the right and privilege of making a full opposition answer whether timely or tardy.",
    "[37]\nThere is no prejudice nor additional expense for the private respondent (trademark applicant) in this regard in relation to proceedings under the\nTrade Marks Act\n. If there be any prejudice at all, it resides in the private respondent's seeking, perhaps, to acquire that which parliament has so clearly accorded and reserved to Can. Post under the\nC.P.C.A.\nThat is a matter which can be determined by the TMOB, but after Can. Post's imperative opposition grounds, created and promoted by the\nC.P.C.A.\n, are fully articulated for the attention of the TMOB.",
    "[38]\nThe applicant, Can. Post, is entitled to amend its statement of opposition in the manner proposed. The TMOB's exercise of discretion to refuse such amendments manifests an error in law, that is, misinterpretation of the effect and weight of\nCanada Post Corporation Act\nin making imperative the articulation of Can. Post's special status and interest in its statement of opposition.",
    "[39]\nNow, there exists a small dilemma in regard to awarding costs of these proceedings. Counsel for Can. Post argues that his client ought not to have to pay a penny in costs. That may be so, and of course its dilatory somnolent solicitors can always indemnify and save harmless their client in regard to costs, if they wish. It was they, in the first instance who did not realize the full import of Can. Post's extraordinary special statutory status in regard to its property in its corporate identity. Such realization, of course, ought to have dawned on the TMOB, and of course, the solicitors for the private respondent, too. However that respondent, even if properly advised by its solicitors, is less to blame for resisting Can. Post's application for judicial review, than Can. Post is, through its in-house counsel and outside solicitors, for failing to articulate its opposition to the trademark applications and indeed failing to perform its statutory duty in that regard ab initio. These reasons apply to all of Can. Post's various applications to quash the TMOB's refusal of its proposed amendments. Therefore, it appears just to this court to award the unsuccessful private respondent full party-and-party costs forthwith after taxation against the victorious Can. Post in this proceeding; and full disbursements but one-third counsel fees only in the following proceedings: T-1603-91, T-1606-91, T-1607-91 and T-1608-91.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Steven C.

  "full_text": "[1]\nMuldoon, J.\n: The applicant's solicitors made an omelette of this, and eight parallel applications, which was largely unscrambled by order, dated May 29, 1991, pronounced by Mr. Justice Rouleau. Thus, these reasons will apply additionally to four concurrent trademark applications before the respondent Board brought before this court in four other proceedings, each finally with its own file and suit number, and four others with other respondents.\n[2]\nAccording to the originating notice made to serve for this particular proceeding the applicant seeks:\n\"... the issuance of writs of certiorari and mandamus, or orders in the nature thereof, against the Registrar of Trademarks Opposition Board, pursuant to s. 18 ... setting aside the refusal of the Opposition Board to permit certain amendments to CPC's statements of opposition herein, and directing the Registrar and his delegate, the Opposition Board, to permit CPC, pursuant to Trademarks Regulation 42, to allow the said amendments, the said amendments having been refused by the Opposition Board on February 28, 1991.\n\"The grounds of the motions are that the Opposition Board, in refusing the amendments, erred in fact and in law, and proceeded on wrong principles, as follows:\n(a) erred in concluding that there would be prejudice to the respondents in allowing the amendments;\n(b) erred in overlooking the prejudice to CPC in refusing the amendments;\n(c) erred in concluding that the amendments would give rise to delay;\n(d) erred in giving weight to CPC's delay in seeking the amendments;\n(e) erred in law in concluding that certain of the amendments sought did not have merit;\n(f) erred in failing to consider and apply the well-established criteria in relation to permitting amendments to pleadings.\n\"The following documentary evidence will be presented: evidence regarding the proceedings before the Opposition Board in relation to the refused amendments, namely, the affidavit of Michael D. Manson, sworn June 18, 1991.\"\n[3]\nAs is apparent from the said supporting affidavit, and emphasized by the exhibits thereto, it is virtually impossible to describe and adjudicate the issues herein without making reference to the professional ineptitude of the applicant's solicitors. That melancholy matter forms the raison d'être of these originating motions. Notable are paragraphs 6(a), (b) and (c) of Michael D. Manson's affidavit, in which he avers that the applicant's solicitors had either completely overlooked or quite misapprehended the significance of the following important jurisprudence:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M.O.B.);\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Que. S.C.); and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 161 (F.C.A.).\n[4]\nOn August 29, 1990, the applicant's solicitors wrote to the Registrar of Trademarks a letter, copied to the private respondent's solicitors, in which they indicated that the Canada Post Corporation (hereinafter: Can. Post) was seeking leave to amend further the statement of opposition against the respondent's trademark application which Can. Post had effected on September 2, 1988, and already amended a first time on April 25, 1989. Pertinent passages of that request to amend run thus:\n\"The opponent's [i.e. Can. Post's] proposed amendments in new paragraph (c) of the amended statement of opposition has [sic] been prompted by the decision\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  58 of the\nPostal Act\nand s. 9(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. He stated that the prohibition in s. 58(2) was of a lower order than the test of either deception or confusion and was in fact a test of 'suggesting' and held that use by the defendants of the word 'post' in their respective corporate names and on their stamps and elsewhere in their operations constituted a violation of the provisions of s. 58 of the\nPostal Act\n. He stated at page 224 of the reported decision:\n'If in this country as throughout the world, words like \"mail\", \"post\" and \"post office\" have in the experience of all, been associated with the only postal system we have ever known, how can one conclude otherwise than by affirming that the use of the words \"post\" and \"post office\", \"suggest\" that that which is prohibited in subsections [sic] (a), (b) and (c) of s. 58(2)?'\n\"This decision only very recently came to the attention of the agents for the opponent, since the opponent did not appreciate its possible significance in an opposition proceeding. Having regard to this decision, applicant seeks to amend the statement of opposition to insert new paragraph 1(c).\n\"The opponent as well seeks to amend the ... opposition by inserting subparagraph (g), which deals with the prohibition afforded by s. 9(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. The opponent's agent only became aware of the possibility of asserting this ground of opposition very recently as a result of the reported decision of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As well, the principals of the opponent who instruct the opponent's agent in respect of this opposition were also not aware of this decision until very recently. Accordingly, the opponent seeks to insert this ground of opposition in order to have all relevant grounds of opposition before the hearing officer.\n\"The opponent also seeks to amend the statement of opposition by amending subparagraphs (e) and (f) to include additional s. 9 marks in respect of which public notice has been given. This amendment is made having regard to the recent and very significant decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, it was held that the prohibition against registration under subsection 12(1)(e) applies to any trademark which has not yet been registered on the date of publication of an official mark. The opponent seeks to insert all the s. 9 marks owned by the opponent which have been published to date and which are relevant to this opposition.\n\"The opponent further seeks to amend subparagraph (c) (new subparagraph (d)) of the statement of opposition to refer to the fact that the applications for the trademark Mail Poste and Poste Mail & Designs were registered on October 27, 1989 as registration Nos. TMA 361,467 and TMA 361,468, respectively. While the decision in the\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wording is identical. In other words, the prohibitions of paragraphs (d) and (e) are the same; both of which speak in terms of the present. It is submitted that it is impossible for the decision in the\nAllied\ncase to be correct with reference to paragraph (e) of the\nTrade Marks Act\nwithout the same principle being applicable to paragraph (d).\n\"Thus, it is submitted that the\nAllied\ndecision has, in effect, restored the decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\nAllied\ndecisions are consistent with another decision of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which it was held that the date of decision is the material date, but the issue was not discussed at any length.\n\"None of the amendments give [sic] rise to any need for additional evidence on behalf of the opponent. We would not oppose any request by the applicant to file new evidence in relation to the new issues.\n\"Accordingly, it is requested that leave be granted to make the appropriate amendments. It is submitted that these amendments to the statement of opposition are necessary to ensure that all issues are before the Opposition Board for consideration in rendering its decision in respect of this matter.\n\"Finally, it is also requested that the opponent be granted an extension of four months in which to file its reply evidence in respect of this opposition. This additional time is required because of the complexity of these proceedings. Furthermore, having regard to the above request for leave to amend the statement of opposition, it is respectfully submitted that the request for the extension of time in which to file the reply evidence is reasonable and warranted. Our cheque of today's date includes the prescribed $50 government fee.\"\n[5]\nThe solicitors for the private respondent (the trademark applicant) objected vigorously to Can. Post's request to amend its statement of opposition. They wrote to the Registrar of Trademarks on October 2, 1990, and made these objections, among others:\n\"... The fact that the background research conducted by the agents for the opponent at the time the Statement of Opposition and Amended Statement of Opposition were prepared and filed was incomplete does not constitute a valid basis upon which to base a request for leave to amend a pleading, particularly at this late stage in the proceedings after both parties have filed their evidence.\n\"It is also our submission that the new ground of opposition proposed to be relied upon in new paragraph 1(c) of the Amended Statement of Opposition is without merit. The Trademarks Opposition Board has in a number of past decisions rendered in the past made it clear that the possibility that an applicant's use of a mark sought to be registered may contravene some other statute is not relevant in opposition proceedings.\n. . . . .\n\"... The ground of opposition proposed to be introduced has been available to the opponent from the outset of these proceedings. The only basis which the agents for the opponent have offered to support their request for leave to amend to add a ground of opposition based on s. 9(1)(d) is the fact that the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  submission that this decision failed to break any new ground and did not recognize a ground of opposition which was previously unavailable. The fact that the research conducted by the agents for the opponents was incomplete or that their instructing principals failed to advise them to rely on this ground of opposition should not be considered by the Registrar to justify the request for leave to further amend the Amended Statement of Opposition at this stage.\n. . . . .\n\"... [T]he agents for the opponent have failed to set forth\nany\ngrounds to properly support ... leave to amend paragraphs 1(e) and 1(f) to refer to additional marks ... previously used ... and additional marks which are the subject of s. 9 protection.\n. . . . .\n\"... We are also surprised that the agents for the opponent have attempted to justify the proposed amendments on the basis of the decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . This decision was rendered well before the opponent's Amended Statement of Opposition was filed and does not, in our view, give rise to a ground of opposition that was previously unavailable to the opponent. ... [T]he agents for the opponent have to provide an appropriate excuse to explain why reference to these additional marks were [sic] not, or could not be possibly have been, included in the Statement of Opposition as originally filed or as amended on April 25, 1989. Further, the applicant's evidence was formulated and filed on the basis of the pleadings. We respectfully submit that it would be highly prejudicial to the applicant's case to permit the proposed amendments to be introduced at this late date.\n. . . . .\n\"... [T]he amendment which the opponent proposes to make to subparagraph (d) to refer to the fact that the applicant's applications for 'Mail Poste' and 'Poste Mail & Design' have issued to registration is redundant and adds no new ground of opposition.\n. . . . .\n\"The agents for the opponent have also requested an extension of time within which to file reply evidence. ... [T]he grant of a further extension of time is not justified as the opponent has already had ample time to prepare its evidence. We also submit that the agents for the opponent have failed to provide any reasons which properly support the grant of the extension requested.\"\n[6]\nThe impugned decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board, (hereinafter: TMOB), dated February 28, 1991, in its pertinent passages, runs as follows:\n\"... [A]llowing the opponent to effect any of the desired revisions to the statement of opposition would result in prejudice to the applicant. [The private respondent herein.] There would be additional delay in this proceeding, the applicant would be obliged to answer the new grounds of opposition and the applicant might have to file additional evidence. Furthermore, the opponent has not given entirely satisfactory reasons as to why leave was not sought much earlier respecting many of the desired revisions to the statement of opposition.\n\"As for proposed new paragraphs 1(c) and 1(g) of the statement of opposition, these proposed grounds of opposition were available to the opponent from the outset. The same observation applies to the revisions sought to be made to new paragraph 1(e).\n\"The opponent is also seeking to revise new paragraph 1(d) to include reference to the registrations issuing from the two applications referred to in that paragraph. Although it is not apparent from a reading of new paragraph 1(d), it would appear from the opponent's letter of August 29 that it is seeking to rely on these two registrations in support of a ground of opposition pursuant to s. 12(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. However, the material time for considering the circumstances respecting such a ground is as of the filing of the opposition. Consequently, the opponent is precluded from relying on subsequently issued registrations.\n\"Most of the additional official marks sought to be added to paragraph 1(f) were published well before the commencement of the present opposition. Thus, it is not seen how the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the\nAllied\ncase relied on by the opponent justifies the addition of these additional official marks. It does, however, provide justification for the addition of the final five official marks listed in paragraph 1(f) of the proposed revised statement of opposition since notice of those five marks was only given in 1989.\n\"In view of the above, the opponent is hereby granted leave pursuant to rule 42 to include reliance on the final five official marks listed in paragraph 1(f) of the proposed revised statement of opposition. The opponent's rule 42 request is otherwise refused. Consequently, the opponent will have one month from the date of this letter within which to file and serve a revised statement of opposition in accordance with today's grant of leave.\"\n[7]\nCan. Post's amended statement of opposition, contained a passage designated 1(f) which made no reference to s. 9 or to s. 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, and listed no official marks of which public notice had been given in the\nTrade Marks Journal\n. (Can. Post's motion record: p. 000115-16.) The paragraph designated 1(f) in the Can. Post's impugned statement of opposition, however, including the significant last five official marks therein listed, runs thus:\n\"1(f) The proposed trademark is not registrable because, contrary to paragraph 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, it is a mark the adoption of which is prohibited by s. 9 of the\nAct\n, in that it so nearly resembles that it is likely to be mistaken for the following official marks, public notice of which was given in the following issues of the\nTrade Marks Journal\n:\nOfficial Mark\nNumber\nNotice Date\nPriority Post - Poste Prioritaires\n900,671\nMay 1978\nIntelpost\n900,673\nApril 15, 1981\nAdmail\n900,674\nMay 20, 1981\nMediaposte & Design\n900,675\nFebruary 10, 1982\nAdmail & Design\n900,676\nApril 28, 1982\nMediaposte\n900,677\nFebruary 26, 1982\nElectronic Mail Courrier Electronique & Design\n900,678\nDecember 14, 1983\nCourrier Electronique\n900,679\nFebruary 22, 1984\nElectronic Mail\n900,680\nFebruary 22, 1984\nMailtrac\n900,681\nMay 2, 1984\nMessageries Poste Prioritaire\n900,682\nFebruary 2, 1984\nPriority Post Courier\n900,683\nFebruary 2, 1984\nSupermailbox\n903,039\nNovember 25, 1987\nMail Poste & Design\n903,803\nMarch 30, 1989\nPoste Mail & Design\n903,806\nMarch 30, 1989\nPoste Mail & Design\n903,807\nMarch 30, 1989\nPriority Courier\n903,973\nDecember 6, 1989\nMessageries Prioritaires\n903,974\nDecember 6, 1989\"\n[8]\nThe other proposed amendments rejected by the TMOB, are new paragraphs 1(c), (d), (e) and (g). They run as follows:\n\"(c) If the applicant uses the proposed trademark in association with the services set out in applicant's application, it would suggest that the use of such services has been authorized or approved by the opponent, or that such services are used in the business of the opponent, or that such services are of a kind similar or identical to services used in the business of the opponent. Such use would be without the written consent of the opponent and would be contrary to the provisions of the aforesaid\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, ss. 58(1) and (2). Accordingly, the application does not comply with s. 30(i) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, because the applicant could not, at the date of filing of the application, have been satisfied that it was entitled to use the trademark in Canada, since such use would be unlawful.\n\"(d) The applicant is not the person entitled to registration because, at the date of filing of the application, the applicant's trademark was confusing with the trademarks Mail Poste and Poste Mail & Designs, in respect of which applications for registration, Nos. 577,188 and 577,189, had been previously (on January 30, 1987) filed in Canada by the opponent, and which were pending at the date of advertisement of the applicant's application. These said applications were registered on October 27, 1989 as registration Nos. TMA 361,467 and TMA 361,468, respectively.\n\"(e) The applicant is not the person entitled to registration of the trademark because, at the date of filing of the application, it was confusing with the trademarks and trade names Canada Post Corporation, Canada Post and Post Office, Admail, Courrier Electronique, Electronic Mail Courrier Electronique & Design, Electronic Mail, Intelpost, Mailtrac, Mediaposte & Design, Mediaposte, Supermailbox, Mail Poste & Design, Poste Mail & Design, Priority Post, Postes Prioritaires, Messageries Poste Prioritaire, Priority Post Courier, Priority Courier and Messageries Prioritaires, all of which had been previously used in Canada by the opponent and/or its predecessor, Her Majesty in Right of Canada, acting as The Post Office Department.\n. . . . .\n\"(g) The trademark is not registrable, because contrary to paragraph 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, it is a mark the adoption of which is prohibited by s. 9(1)(d) of the\nAct\n, having regard to the aforesaid official marks, trademarks and trade names of the opponent, the applicant's trademark is likely to lead to the belief that services in associations with which it is proposed to be used have received or are produced, sold or performed under governmental patronage, approval or authority.\"\n[9]\nThere are proposed certain internal amendments to correct paragraph 1(i) of the opposition statement which is now proposed to appear as follows:\n\"(i) The opponent had not abandoned any of the trademarks, official marks and trade names referred to above at the date of advertisement of the applicant's application.\"\n[10]\nOn the issue of prejudice, if any, which may be suffered by the respective parties, it is true that this litigation does create some delay. However, at the best of times trademark opposition proceedings do not operate with vertiginous alacrity and since that seems to be nobody's fault, it is just accepted. In this regard, the court accepts the applicant's counsel's arguments to the effect that no prejudice can truly be alleged in that no witness has died leaving potential testimony unrecorded, no document has been lost and no respondent's mark has been infringed. In such circumstances prima facie valid amendments of the statement of opposition ought to be permitted. There would, however, arise serious prejudice to Can. Post if it were forever foreclosed from having its full opposition adjudicated only because of its solicitors' seeming somnolence.\n[11]\nCan. Post's counsel indicated, with great satisfaction and hope, the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board in application no. 593,671 for the trademark \"Datamail Canada\", filed by 690062 Ontario Limited. The decision is dated June 28, 1991. Can. Post is alleged to have prevailed on the merits, but the one-person opposition board wrote, at page 5 of the decision:\n\"The applicant [i.e. 690062 Ontario Limited] did not file evidence in support of its application. Both parties filed written arguments. The applicant's written argument is very brief. [Not an inherent fault!], and merely reiterates the denials and assertions in the counter statement. Only the opponent was represented at an oral hearing.\"\nAnd further it is stated on p. 7:\n\"Having regard to the above, I am satisfied that the opponent has adduced sufficient evidence to at least meet its initial burden with respect to supporting its ground of opposition that the applied for mark is not distinctive of the applicant's services.\n\"Considering that the applicant has not filed any evidence in support of its application, and that its written argument is not persuasive, I find that the applicant has not met the legal burden on it to establish that the applied for mark is distinctive of the applicant at the material date January 9, 1989. The opponent therefore succeeds on its ground of opposition denoted by 1(h). Consequently, the remaining grounds of opposition need not be considered.\n\"In view of the above, the applicant's application is refused.\"\n[12]\nThat disposition was not so much a prevailing on the merits on Can. Post's part as a prevailing almost by default. So it was, it seems, in regard to Can. Post's obtaining permission twice to amend its statement of opposition. The trademark applicant in that case never did object to such amendments. In the present circumstances, the significance of the \"Datamail Canada\" decision is not so great as counsel has urged.\n[13]\nOf considerably, if not crucially, greater significance in this case is the judgment of Halperin, J., of the Quebec Superior Court in\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  'mail', 'post' and 'post office' have in the experience of all, been associated with the only postal system we have ever known, [so] how can one conclude otherwise than by affirming that the use of [such] words ... 'suggest' that which is prohibited in subsections [sic] (a), (b) and (c) of s. 58(2)\" [of the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 54, now R.S.C. 1985, c. C-10]? The statement of opposition clearly ought to contain the reference to s. 58(1) and (2) of the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n(hereinafter\nC.P.C.A.\n) as expressed in paragraph 1(c) which the opponent seeks to emplace therein by means of the amendment which the opposition board has rejected. It ought to contain it, no matter the duration of time in which the opponent's solicitors were asleep on the job.\n[14]\nJolted awake also by their discovery of the opposition board member's 1990 decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  statement by inserting paragraph 1(g), and rightly so. Paragraph 1(g) is important in regard to the adoption of the official marks of which public notice has been given in the\nTrade Marks Journal\n, especially Supermailbox, No. 903-039, whose notice date was November 25, 1987. Paragraph 1(g) simply ought to be included in the opposition statement of this particular opponent, Can. Post, despite the length of time in which its solicitors were asleep on the job.\n[15]\nInasmuch as the opposition board in deciding\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  therefore gave utterly no consideration or effect to ss. 5(2)(e) and 19(1)(r), and ss. 23, 25, 56, 58 and 61 thereof, then that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case is wrongly decided. The TMOB has no right or jurisdiction simply to blink away solemnly enacted, statutory statements of public policy made by parliament in regard to the very subject before the board. The Registrar and the TMOB, like the Sovereign or like this court, are not above the law.\n[16]\nThe 1989 judgment of this court's appeal division in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  apparently dark sky of consciousness. It surely supports the proposed content configuration of paragraphs 1(e) and (f) as they are proposed by the opponent's solicitors. Such matters require the interpretation of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10, and of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, imported by Mr. Justice MacGuigan for a unanimous panel of the appeal division in December 1989. Consideration of the content of paragraphs 1(e) and (f) in the statement of opposition is (and always was) exacted by the virtually unique status of Can. Post, a public authority with its own statutory trademark protection over and above that which it may also invoke under the\nTrade Marks Act\n. Because of that virtually unique statutory status, Can. Post cannot logically suffer erosion of its paramount status under and by virtue of merely adjectival provisions in the\nTrade Marks Act\n. The provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\nmust be taken to be buttressed by the substantive provisions of the\nTrade Marks Act\nand must be respected as the authentic will of parliament in this regard.\n[17]\nAs noted, although the respondent herein generally alleges prejudice if the Can. Post's proposed amendments be permitted, no specific prejudice is demonstrated, apart from the effluxion of time, and the lack of compensatory costs in the opposition proceedings. If there be one sure aspect of opposition proceedings it is that they seem to take a long time, in any event, from whatever cause amply justifiable or otherwise. However the respondent's plight is not so terrible as its counsel would have the court believe, simply because in such proceeding the Registrar of Trademarks cannot award costs for or against any party in any event. That is not to say that this court is powerless to award costs in these proceedings, a matter to which the court will return later herein.\n[18]\nThe salient feature of Can. Post, its opposition to the respondent's trademark applications, and its appeal for permission to make even a second round of significant amendments to its opposition it its paramount statutory status, conferred by the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n. This factor pervades any and all cases in which Can. Post is involved in a trademark application or opposition. It is a matter of public policy and public order, which the TMOB is bound to respect.\n[19]\nLeaving aside for the moment those matters of public policy and public order emanating from Can. Post's special statutory status in regard to maintaining its corporate identity as an institution of the government of Canada, and as an agent of the Crown in right of Canada, one may find support for Can. Post's posture herein in ordinary jurisprudence applicable to ordinary litigants. Such support resides in the principles stated by the jurisprudence cited by Can. Post's counsel.\n[20]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Teitelbaum of this court, as reported, wrote:\n\"The courts should not intervene in the discretionary powers of the Registrar of Trademarks as given to him by the\nAct\nunless\nhe is clearly acting outside his jurisdiction or\nhe is\nacting '\nclearly wrong\nhaving regard to the facts'.\n\"This principle was enunciated by Mr. Justice Heald in the case of\nCentennial Grocery Brokers Ltd.\n[(1972), 5 C.P.R.(2d) 235, [1972] F.C. 257], at p. 239 C.P.R., p. 261 F.C., where Heald, J., states:\n'I should not interfere with the Registrar's exercise of discretion unless he was clearly wrong and I am not prepared to say that he was clearly wrong having regard to the facts in this case.'\n\"I do believe that the registrar was 'clearly wrong' in asking for further clarification of the reasons for the requested extension.\n\"The affidavit submitted on behalf of the respondent, the affidavit of Alan M. Troicuk dated April 8, 1986, states what the current practice of the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs is with regard to such applications.\n\"Paragraph 4 of the affidavit states what the procedure is:\n'It is also the practice of the Trademarks Office to consider up to the time of allowance any request for a retroactive extension of time under s. 46(2) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. If material initially filed with the request is insufficient, the practice is to advise the requesting party of the statutory requirements for an extension and to ask the party to address these statutory requirements by way of an additional submission, which submission must be filed within a certain time frame.'\n\"It seems to me that this practice is ultimately fair. A person who may wish to oppose a trademark should be given every\nreasonable\nopportunity to do so within the confines of the\nAct\n.\" (Emphasis not in original text)\n[21]\nAccording to Mr. Justice Collier's judgment reported as\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 458, the Registrar's decision \"must be on proper legal principles, and in the interests of justice between the parties\"; but the court can interfere \"if it appears he [the Registrar or the TMOB] has proceeded upon improper or erroneous principles or\noverlooked an important matter\n\" (emphasis not in original text). Collier, J., was there considering the dispute of two wholly private litigants and not even one endowed with special statutory status which is of course \"an important matter\" not to be overlooked in cases like this one.\n[22]\nSo also stated Mr. Justice Dubé of this court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), thus:\n\"Again it is not for the court to substitute its own decision to that of the Registrar. The court may only move and exercise its own discretion where all the facts were not before the Registrar, or\nwhere he did not take into account all the relevant factors\n, or where there is an error of fact or of law on the face of the record, or where procedural irregularities may have influenced the final determination of the decision, or where a decision is scandalous, or frivolous, or bereft of any sound or objective motive.\" (He cited much jurisprudence in support.)\n[23]\nHere was a case of a private opponent, without any special status, par excellence, for Dubé, J., noted at the end of his reasons:\n\"The crux of the argument of the appellant is that it is not reasonable to require 'small and unsophisticated' companies to subscribe to the\nTrade Marks Journal\nor to engage a trademark agent to review the\nTrade Marks Journal\non their behalf. Obviously, that argument has no merit. A notice in the\nTrade Marks Journal\nis proper, legal notice to the world. The Registrar cannot be expected to grant special dispenses to small and unsophisticated companies. Indeed, such an exercise of discretion on his part would be quickly challenged by those who have acted in a timely fashion in accordance with the\nAct\n.\"\nIngredients there, were not present in the case at bar: here, \"taking into account all the relevant factors\", must include respecting Can. Post's special statutory status, a status of which Kitchen Craft Connection Inc. could not boast, leaving it bereft in the circumstances, for the same stated principles apply here as well as there, even although the facts and factors differ.\n[24]\nSo it is, in consonance with the pervasive principle, the court must ask: \"Did the Registrar err in law or apply any wrong principle?\" as stated by Mr. Justice Mahoney in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at p. 56 for a unanimous Appeal Division of this court. There was a case establishing that whether or not to grant an extension of time to an ordinary opponent under s. 46 of the\nAct\nis very much a matter of the Registrar's discretion. The opponent there, Star-Kist, was very much an ordinary opponent without special statutory status.\n[25]\nIt is quite apparent that while the principle is constant the facts and factors may vary so markedly as to produce entirely opposite conclusions. Thus, Mr. Justice Rouleau, whose decision in\nStar-Kist\nwas unanimously upheld by the Appeal Division, came to an opposite conclusion in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 7 F.T.R. 149 (F.C.T.D.), at p. 130 where he is reported to have written:\n\"In situations where discretionary powers are exercised without having regard to all relevant facts or where there may be an error on the face of the record, or there exists a procedural irregularity which eventually had an influence on the final determination made by the decision-maker, the exercise of that discretion should be subject to review by the court in its supervisory capacity.\nIf the disregard for the facts\nor the overlooking of some procedure\nwas a relative factor in determining the outcome\n, the court should exercise its discretion and set aside the decision or order.\" (Emphasis not in original text)\nAlways, due attention to, and respect for, the facts and factors are essential to the orientation of the outcome, even between ordinary litigants, for the operation of the principle remains constant. Different circumstances in the constant principle's operation will dictate different outcomes. In this case, the circumstances dictate the success of this motion and permission once again, to amend the statement of opposition, as Can. Post proposes.\n[26]\nWhat is so out-of-the-ordinary, so special is, as previously above mentioned, Can. Post's special statutory status. It is described in the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, above cited (and hereinafter cited R.S.C. 1985, c. C-10). The provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\naffect and augment Can. Post's status of opponent in trademark proceedings, because the right of corporate identity pervades Can. Post's special monopolistic status. That places it in a more favourable position than that of ordinary parties to such proceedings.\n[27]\nHere are some salient, pertinent provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, viewed apart from the overall scope of status and recognition carved for Can. Post generally by the very existence of the\nAct\n. Emphasis is added.\n\"2(1) In this Act,\n. . . . .\n'\nCorporation\n' means the Canada\nPost\nCorporation established by s. 4;\n'\nmail\n' [the noun, not the verb] means\nmailable matter\nfrom the time it is posted to the time it is delivered to the addressee thereof;\n'\nmail bag\n' means any container or covering in which mail is transmitted, whether it contains\nmail\nor not;\n'\nmail contractor\n' means a person who has entered into a contract with the Corporation for the\ntransmission of mail\n, which contract has not expired or been terminated;\n'\nmail conveyance\n' means any physical, electronic, optical or other means used to transmit mail;\n'\nmailable matter\n' means any message, information, funds or goods that may be transmitted by\npost\n; [the noun, not the verb]\n. . . . .\n'\npost\n' [the verb, not the noun] means to leave in a\npost office\nor with a person authorized by the Corporation to receive mailable matter;\n'\npost office\n' includes any place, receptacle, device or mail conveyance authorized by the Corporation for the\nposting\n[the verb's gerund], receipt, sorting, handling, transmission or delivery of mail;\n'\npostage\n' means the charge or surcharge payable for the collection, transmission and delivery by the Corporation of messages, information, funds or goods and for insurance or other special services provided by the Corporation in relation thereto;\n'\npostage stamp\n' means any stamp, postage impression or postage meter impression authorized by the Corporation for the purpose of paying postage;\n'\npostage remittance\n' means any instrument authorized by the Corporation for the remittance of funds;\n. . . . .\n'\ntransmit\n' means to send or convey from one place to another place by any physical, electronic, optical or other means;\n'\ntransmit by post\n' [the noun] means to transmit through or by means of the Corporation.\n. . . . .\n\"(2) For the purposes of this Act,\n(a) leaving\nmail\nat the place of residence or business of the addressee thereof,\n(b) depositing\nmail\nin a\npost office\nlock box or rural mail box or any other receptacle or device provided for the receipt of\nmail\nof the addressee, or\n(c)\nleaving mail\nwith the addressee or his servant or agent or with any other person who may reasonably be considered to be authorized to receive\nmail\nby the addressee thereof,\naccording to the usual manner of delivering\nmail\nto that addressee, is deemed to be delivery to the addressee.\n\"(3) For the purposes of this Act, a thing is deemed to be in the course of\npost\nfrom the time it is posted to the time it is delivered to the addressee or returned to the sender thereof.\n\"3. This act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province.\n. . . . .\nObjects\n\"5(1) The objects of the Corporation are\n(a) to establish and operate a\npostal service\nfor the collection, transmission and delivery of messages, information, funds and goods both within Canada and between Canada and places outside Canada;\n(b) to manufacture and provide such products and to provide such services as are, in the opinion of the Corporation, necessary or incidental to the\npostal service\nprovided by the Corporation; and\n(c)\nto provide\nto or on behalf of departments and agencies of, and corporations owned, controlled or operated by, the government of Canada or any provincial, regional or municipal government in Canada or to any person\nservices that, in the opinion of the Corporation, are capable of being conveniently provided in the course of carrying out the other objects of the Corporation\n.\n\"(2) While maintaining basic customary\npostal service\n, the Corporation, in carrying out its objects, shall have regard to\n(a) the desirability of improving and\nextending its\nproducts and\nservices in the light of developments in the field of communications\n;\n(b) the\nneed to conduct its operations on a self-sustaining basis\nwhile providing a standard of service that will meet the needs of the people of Canada and that is similar with respect to communities of the same size;\n(c) the need to conduct its operations in such manner as will best provide for the security of\nmail\n;\n. . . . .\n(e) the\nneed to maintain a corporate identity program\napproved by the Governor-in-Council that reflects the role of the\nCorporation as an institution of the government of Canada\n.\n. . . . .\nExclusive Privilege of Corporation\n\"14(1) Subject to s. 15, the Corporation has the\nsole and exclusive privilege\nof collecting, transmitting and delivering letters to the addressee thereof within Canada.\n. . . . .\nPowers\n\"16(1) In carrying out its objects and duties under this Act, the Corporation has the capacity, and subject to this Act, the rights, powers and privileges of a natural person.\n\"(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the\nCorporation may acquire, hold, lease, sell or dispose of any\nreal or\npersonal property\n.\n. . . . .\nRegulations\n\"19(1) The Corporation may, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, make regulations for the efficient operation of the business of the Corporation and for carrying the purposes and provisions of this Act into effect, and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may make regulations\n. . . . .\n(b) classifying mailable matter, including the\nsetting of standards\nfor any class thereof;\n(c) prescribing the conditions under which mailable matter may be\ntransmitted by post\n;\n. . . . .\n(k) governing the\ndesign\n, placement and use of\nany receptacle or device\nintended for the posting, insertion, reception, storage, transmission or delivery of mailable matter;\n. . . . .\n(n) regulating or prohibiting the\nmaking or printing of postage impressions\n;\n. . . . .\n(s) providing for the operation of any\nservices\nor systems established\npursuant to this Act\n.\n. . . . .\nStatus of Corporation\n\"23. The\nCorporation is\n, for the purposes of this Act,\nan agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada\n.\n. . . . .\n\"25. No Act relating to the winding-up of a corporation applies in respect of the Corporation and in no case shall the affairs of the Corporation be wound up\nunless Parliament so provides\n.\n. . . . .\nOffences and Punishment\n\"56. Every person who,\nin violation of the exclusive privilege of the Corporation under s. 14\n, collects, transmits or delivers to the addressee thereof, or undertakes to collect, transmit or deliver to the addressee thereof, any letter within Canada, or receives or has in his possession within Canada any letter for the purpose of so transmitting or delivering it, commits an offence in respect of each such letter.\n. . . . .\n\"58(1) Every person commits an offence who, without the written consent of the Corporation, places or permits or causes to be placed or to remain on his premises the words '\npost office\n', or any other word or mark suggesting that such premises are a post office or a place for the receipt of letters.\n\"(2) Every person commits an offence who, without the written consent of the Corporation, places on any thing\nany word or mark suggesting\nthat the thing\n(a) has been duly authorized or approved by the Corporation;\n(b) is used in the\nbusiness of the Corporation\n; or\n(c) is of a\nkind similar\nor\nidentical\nto any thing\nused in the business of the Corporation\n.\n. . . . .\n\"60. Every person who contravenes any provision of this Act or the regulations or\nwho commits an offence under any of ss. 48 to 59\n(a) is guilty of an\nindictable offence\nand liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or\n(b) is guilty of an\noffence punishable on summary conviction\n.\n\"61. In any prosecution under this Act, evidence that anything bears the words '\nPost Office\n', '\nCanada Post Office\n', '\nCanada Mail\n', '\nCanada Post\n', '\nCanada Post Corporation\n', or\nany similar expression\nis evidence that the thing was established or authorized for use in connection with the Corporation by this Act or the regulations.\"\n[28]\nThe applicant is a very special entity enjoying a very special status accorded by parliament, of which the TMOB is bound to take notice. That special legislated status refers to Can. Post's corporate identity, the monopoly accorded to it in any word or mark suggesting its activities, and the penal consequences to be inflicted on anyone who violates or infringes upon that monopoly.\n[29]\nThe incidents of parliament's special regard for, and statutory protection of Can. Post abound in the\nC.P.C.A.\nand are especially noticeable in the above recited passages. The definitions, especially those of \"mail\", \"mailable matter\" and \"transmit by post\", virtually equate Can. Post with the notions of \"mail or mailing\" and \"post or posting\" of \"any message, information, funds or goods which may be transmitted by post\". These are matters of public policy and public order, because parliament enacted that the\nC.P.C.A.\n\"is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province\". It is a primary statutory mandate of Can. Post to establish and operate a postal service, and it enjoys, also by statute the sole and exclusive privilege of collecting, transmitting and delivering letters in Canada. In the English-language version of s. 5(2) of the\nAct\n, the desirability and the need of certain activities are delineated; but the maintenance of a corporate identity program is legislated as a\nneed\nof this corporation Canada Post, which is an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada, and which is so durable that it cannot be wound up, unless parliament makes special provision.\n[30]\nEven if the issues in this case were being litigated by two wholly private contenders for the property rights accorded by a trademark, even without Can. Post on one side, it would transpire that the appropriate date for consideration of the grounds of opposition pursuant to s. 12(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\nwould be the date upon which the TMOB, delegated by the Registrar, disposed of the opposition on the evidence adduced, That day has not yet dawned. Such principle was enunciated in the recent unanimous decision of this court's Appeal Division, written by Madam Justice Desjardins for release on June 24, 1991, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). This case supports Can. Post's position that the TMOB erred in law in refusing the amendment whereby the applicant (Can. Post) sought to rely on s. 9 marks and registered trademarks of Can. Post which were published and registered respectively, after the date of filing of the opposition. Indeed, this tolls as an error in law underlying the decision attached herein. It certainly so tolls in regard to Can. Post's special status.\n[31]\nIn terms of Can. Post's monopoly and identity, ss. 58, 60 and 61 of the\nAct\ndemonstrate how parliament cherishes, protects and cossets Can. Post, to the extent of criminalizing any activities which falsely proclaim \"post office\" or merely suggest, by any word or mark, that they operate as if approved by the corporation or use things similar to that which it uses in its business. Criminal sanctions are the State's heavy artillery, especially when prosecutable on indictment as potentially are the hybrid offences denounced in s. 60 of the\nC.P.C.A.\nThese, too, are matters of public policy and public order. In that regard the Registrar of Trademarks, and his delegate the TMOB, must understand or be made to realize that they, in common with everyone else, cannot lawfully authorize anyone, including anyone to whom they would issue a trademark, to commit a criminal offence by such means. An issued trademark does not operate to excuse conduct made criminal by the\nC.P.C.A.\n[32]\nPublic policy surely overrides all private individuals' or corporations' claimed proprietary interest in a trademark, as a matter of public order. In regard to statutory interpretation, then, the\nC.P.C.A.\non its plane of public policy cannot be held to be useless and fruitless legislation:\nInutilis labor et sine fructus non est effectus legis\n; or, more concisely received from ancient principle:\nLex nil frustra facit\n, meaning that the protection provided to Can. Post cannot be taken to have been enacted in vain.\n[33]\nIn light of Can. Post's extraordinarily special status conferred by parliament, the corporation cannot lawfully be prevented, on the TMOB's discretion under the rules, from evincing all of its enormous statutory importance in specific regard to Can. Post's marks and words of corporate identity, by refusing the amendments to its statement of opposition just as if Can. Post were an ordinary individual or corporation. Put another way, the law exacts that Can. Post be enabled to evince its special status regarding it corporate identity in order that the TMOB have fully for consideration Can. Post's exertion of its monopoly, status and identity in opposition to anyone and everyone who or which would seek to become the registered holder of trademarks similar to, or even suggesting those of Can. Post, for such marks fall under the ban of outlawry imposed by the specific and general provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n.\n[34]\nIndeed, it is the lawful duty of Can. Post, in regard to the statutory\nneed to maintain a corporate identity program\n, expressed in s. 5(2) of the\nAct\n, to defend and to assert its monopoly in its trademarks, interests and trademark oppositions. This is clearly so, even if its solicitors were asleep on the job, for their dilatoriness cannot conceivably override the plain imperatives of public order and public policy enunciated in the above cited provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, unless the statute so conceded, that which it does not do.\n[35]\nStatutes of public order are most pertinently considered, albeit from a different base of view, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where at page 19 Mr. Justice Taschereau is reported as having written about la\nLoi des architectes\n, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 272:\n\"Cette loi est non seulement une loi d'ordre public, mais elle est aussi une loi prohibitive comportant une pénalité. Il n'est pas nécessaire, je crois, de faire une longue dissertation pour démontrer qu'en principe les lois de ce genre emportent nullité quoiqu'elle n'y soit pas prononçée. (C.C. 14) (Mignault, vol. 1, p. 123.) Le défendeur pouvait évidemment invoquer cette nullité et la faire constater par les tribunaux.\"\nSo it is also with the\nC.P.C.A.\n, a statute of public order which also comports prohibitions of breaches of its provisions under pain of penalties. The TMOB simply must take respectful notice of that statute. Not to do so is an error in law.\n[36]\nThus, the tardiness in expressing grounds of opposition which could foreclose an ordinary opponent, simply cannot prevail against Can. Post, which, by virtue of the explicit and implicit imperatives of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, must be accorded the right and privilege of making a full opposition answer whether timely or tardy.\n[37]\nThere is no prejudice nor additional expense for the private respondent (trademark applicant) in this regard in relation to proceedings under the\nTrade Marks Act\n. If there be any prejudice at all, it resides in the private respondent's seeking, perhaps, to acquire that which parliament has so clearly accorded and reserved to Can. Post under the\nC.P.C.A.\nThat is a matter which can be determined by the TMOB, but after Can. Post's imperative opposition grounds, created and promoted by the\nC.P.C.A.\n, are fully articulated for the attention of the TMOB.\n[38]\nThe applicant, Can. Post, is entitled to amend its statement of opposition in the manner proposed. The TMOB's exercise of discretion to refuse such amendments manifests an error in law, that is, misinterpretation of the effect and weight of\nCanada Post Corporation Act\nin making imperative the articulation of Can. Post's special status and interest in its statement of opposition.\n[39]\nNow, there exists a small dilemma in regard to awarding costs of these proceedings. Counsel for Can. Post argues that his client ought not to have to pay a penny in costs. That may be so, and of course its dilatory somnolent solicitors can always indemnify and save harmless their client in regard to costs, if they wish. It was they, in the first instance who did not realize the full import of Can. Post's extraordinary special statutory status in regard to its property in its corporate identity. Such realization, of course, ought to have dawned on the TMOB, and of course, the solicitors for the private respondent, too. However that respondent, even if properly advised by its solicitors, is less to blame for resisting Can. Post's application for judicial review, than Can. Post is, through its in-house counsel and outside solicitors, for failing to articulate its opposition to the trademark applications and indeed failing to perform its statutory duty in that regard ab initio. These reasons apply to all of Can. Post's various applications to quash the TMOB's refusal of its proposed amendments. Therefore, it appears just to this court to award the unsuccessful private respondent full party-and-party costs forthwith after taxation against the victorious Can. Post in this proceeding; and full disbursements but one-third counsel fees only in the following proceedings: T-1603-91, T-1606-91, T-1607-91 and T-1608-91.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Steven C.

  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nMuldoon, J.\n: The applicant's solicitors made an omelette of this, and eight parallel applications, which was largely unscrambled by order, dated May 29, 1991, pronounced by Mr. Justice Rouleau. Thus, these reasons will apply additionally to four concurrent trademark applications before the respondent Board brought before this court in four other proceedings, each finally with its own file and suit number, and four others with other respondents.\n\n[2]\nAccording to the originating notice made to serve for this particular proceeding the applicant seeks:\n\"... the issuance of writs of certiorari and mandamus, or orders in the nature thereof, against the Registrar of Trademarks Opposition Board, pursuant to s. 18 ... setting aside the refusal of the Opposition Board to permit certain amendments to CPC's statements of opposition herein, and directing the Registrar and his delegate, the Opposition Board, to permit CPC, pursuant to Trademarks Regulation 42, to allow the said amendments, the said amendments having been refused by the Opposition Board on February 28, 1991.\n\"The grounds of the motions are that the Opposition Board, in refusing the amendments, erred in fact and in law, and proceeded on wrong principles, as follows:\n(a) erred in concluding that there would be prejudice to the respondents in allowing the amendments;\n(b) erred in overlooking the prejudice to CPC in refusing the amendments;\n(c) erred in concluding that the amendments would give rise to delay;\n(d) erred in giving weight to CPC's delay in seeking the amendments;\n(e) erred in law in concluding that certain of the amendments sought did not have merit;\n(f) erred in failing to consider and apply the well-established criteria in relation to permitting amendments to pleadings.\n\"The following documentary evidence will be presented: evidence regarding the proceedings before the Opposition Board in relation to the refused amendments, namely, the affidavit of Michael D. Manson, sworn June 18, 1991.\"\n\n[3]\nAs is apparent from the said supporting affidavit, and emphasized by the exhibits thereto, it is virtually impossible to describe and adjudicate the issues herein without making reference to the professional ineptitude of the applicant's solicitors. That melancholy matter forms the raison d'être of these originating motions. Notable are paragraphs 6(a), (b) and (c) of Michael D. Manson's affidavit, in which he avers that the applicant's solicitors had either completely overlooked or quite misapprehended the significance of the following important jurisprudence:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M.O.B.);\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Que. S.C.); and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 161 (F.C.A.).\n\n[4]\nOn August 29, 1990, the applicant's solicitors wrote to the Registrar of Trademarks a letter, copied to the private respondent's solicitors, in which they indicated that the Canada Post Corporation (hereinafter: Can. Post) was seeking leave to amend further the statement of opposition against the respondent's trademark application which Can. Post had effected on September 2, 1988, and already amended a first time on April 25, 1989. Pertinent passages of that request to amend run thus:\n\"The opponent's [i.e. Can. Post's] proposed amendments in new paragraph (c) of the amended statement of opposition has [sic] been prompted by the decision\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  58 of the\nPostal Act\nand s. 9(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. He stated that the prohibition in s. 58(2) was of a lower order than the test of either deception or confusion and was in fact a test of 'suggesting' and held that use by the defendants of the word 'post' in their respective corporate names and on their stamps and elsewhere in their operations constituted a violation of the provisions of s. 58 of the\nPostal Act\n. He stated at page 224 of the reported decision:\n'If in this country as throughout the world, words like \"mail\", \"post\" and \"post office\" have in the experience of all, been associated with the only postal system we have ever known, how can one conclude otherwise than by affirming that the use of the words \"post\" and \"post office\", \"suggest\" that that which is prohibited in subsections [sic] (a), (b) and (c) of s. 58(2)?'\n\"This decision only very recently came to the attention of the agents for the opponent, since the opponent did not appreciate its possible significance in an opposition proceeding. Having regard to this decision, applicant seeks to amend the statement of opposition to insert new paragraph 1(c).\n\"The opponent as well seeks to amend the ... opposition by inserting subparagraph (g), which deals with the prohibition afforded by s. 9(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. The opponent's agent only became aware of the possibility of asserting this ground of opposition very recently as a result of the reported decision of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As well, the principals of the opponent who instruct the opponent's agent in respect of this opposition were also not aware of this decision until very recently. Accordingly, the opponent seeks to insert this ground of opposition in order to have all relevant grounds of opposition before the hearing officer.\n\"The opponent also seeks to amend the statement of opposition by amending subparagraphs (e) and (f) to include additional s. 9 marks in respect of which public notice has been given. This amendment is made having regard to the recent and very significant decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, it was held that the prohibition against registration under subsection 12(1)(e) applies to any trademark which has not yet been registered on the date of publication of an official mark. The opponent seeks to insert all the s. 9 marks owned by the opponent which have been published to date and which are relevant to this opposition.\n\"The opponent further seeks to amend subparagraph (c) (new subparagraph (d)) of the statement of opposition to refer to the fact that the applications for the trademark Mail Poste and Poste Mail & Designs were registered on October 27, 1989 as registration Nos. TMA 361,467 and TMA 361,468, respectively. While the decision in the\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wording is identical. In other words, the prohibitions of paragraphs (d) and (e) are the same; both of which speak in terms of the present. It is submitted that it is impossible for the decision in the\nAllied\ncase to be correct with reference to paragraph (e) of the\nTrade Marks Act\nwithout the same principle being applicable to paragraph (d).\n\"Thus, it is submitted that the\nAllied\ndecision has, in effect, restored the decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\nAllied\ndecisions are consistent with another decision of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which it was held that the date of decision is the material date, but the issue was not discussed at any length.\n\"None of the amendments give [sic] rise to any need for additional evidence on behalf of the opponent. We would not oppose any request by the applicant to file new evidence in relation to the new issues.\n\"Accordingly, it is requested that leave be granted to make the appropriate amendments. It is submitted that these amendments to the statement of opposition are necessary to ensure that all issues are before the Opposition Board for consideration in rendering its decision in respect of this matter.\n\"Finally, it is also requested that the opponent be granted an extension of four months in which to file its reply evidence in respect of this opposition. This additional time is required because of the complexity of these proceedings. Furthermore, having regard to the above request for leave to amend the statement of opposition, it is respectfully submitted that the request for the extension of time in which to file the reply evidence is reasonable and warranted. Our cheque of today's date includes the prescribed $50 government fee.\"\n\n[5]\nThe solicitors for the private respondent (the trademark applicant) objected vigorously to Can. Post's request to amend its statement of opposition. They wrote to the Registrar of Trademarks on October 2, 1990, and made these objections, among others:\n\"... The fact that the background research conducted by the agents for the opponent at the time the Statement of Opposition and Amended Statement of Opposition were prepared and filed was incomplete does not constitute a valid basis upon which to base a request for leave to amend a pleading, particularly at this late stage in the proceedings after both parties have filed their evidence.\n\"It is also our submission that the new ground of opposition proposed to be relied upon in new paragraph 1(c) of the Amended Statement of Opposition is without merit. The Trademarks Opposition Board has in a number of past decisions rendered in the past made it clear that the possibility that an applicant's use of a mark sought to be registered may contravene some other statute is not relevant in opposition proceedings.\n. . . . .\n\"... The ground of opposition proposed to be introduced has been available to the opponent from the outset of these proceedings. The only basis which the agents for the opponent have offered to support their request for leave to amend to add a ground of opposition based on s. 9(1)(d) is the fact that the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  submission that this decision failed to break any new ground and did not recognize a ground of opposition which was previously unavailable. The fact that the research conducted by the agents for the opponents was incomplete or that their instructing principals failed to advise them to rely on this ground of opposition should not be considered by the Registrar to justify the request for leave to further amend the Amended Statement of Opposition at this stage.\n. . . . .\n\"... [T]he agents for the opponent have failed to set forth\nany\ngrounds to properly support ... leave to amend paragraphs 1(e) and 1(f) to refer to additional marks ... previously used ... and additional marks which are the subject of s. 9 protection.\n. . . . .\n\"... We are also surprised that the agents for the opponent have attempted to justify the proposed amendments on the basis of the decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . This decision was rendered well before the opponent's Amended Statement of Opposition was filed and does not, in our view, give rise to a ground of opposition that was previously unavailable to the opponent. ... [T]he agents for the opponent have to provide an appropriate excuse to explain why reference to these additional marks were [sic] not, or could not be possibly have been, included in the Statement of Opposition as originally filed or as amended on April 25, 1989. Further, the applicant's evidence was formulated and filed on the basis of the pleadings. We respectfully submit that it would be highly prejudicial to the applicant's case to permit the proposed amendments to be introduced at this late date.\n. . . . .\n\"... [T]he amendment which the opponent proposes to make to subparagraph (d) to refer to the fact that the applicant's applications for 'Mail Poste' and 'Poste Mail & Design' have issued to registration is redundant and adds no new ground of opposition.\n. . . . .\n\"The agents for the opponent have also requested an extension of time within which to file reply evidence. ... [T]he grant of a further extension of time is not justified as the opponent has already had ample time to prepare its evidence. We also submit that the agents for the opponent have failed to provide any reasons which properly support the grant of the extension requested.\"\n\n[6]\nThe impugned decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board, (hereinafter: TMOB), dated February 28, 1991, in its pertinent passages, runs as follows:\n\"... [A]llowing the opponent to effect any of the desired revisions to the statement of opposition would result in prejudice to the applicant. [The private respondent herein.] There would be additional delay in this proceeding, the applicant would be obliged to answer the new grounds of opposition and the applicant might have to file additional evidence. Furthermore, the opponent has not given entirely satisfactory reasons as to why leave was not sought much earlier respecting many of the desired revisions to the statement of opposition.\n\"As for proposed new paragraphs 1(c) and 1(g) of the statement of opposition, these proposed grounds of opposition were available to the opponent from the outset. The same observation applies to the revisions sought to be made to new paragraph 1(e).\n\"The opponent is also seeking to revise new paragraph 1(d) to include reference to the registrations issuing from the two applications referred to in that paragraph. Although it is not apparent from a reading of new paragraph 1(d), it would appear from the opponent's letter of August 29 that it is seeking to rely on these two registrations in support of a ground of opposition pursuant to s. 12(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. However, the material time for considering the circumstances respecting such a ground is as of the filing of the opposition. Consequently, the opponent is precluded from relying on subsequently issued registrations.\n\"Most of the additional official marks sought to be added to paragraph 1(f) were published well before the commencement of the present opposition. Thus, it is not seen how the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the\nAllied\ncase relied on by the opponent justifies the addition of these additional official marks. It does, however, provide justification for the addition of the final five official marks listed in paragraph 1(f) of the proposed revised statement of opposition since notice of those five marks was only given in 1989.\n\"In view of the above, the opponent is hereby granted leave pursuant to rule 42 to include reliance on the final five official marks listed in paragraph 1(f) of the proposed revised statement of opposition. The opponent's rule 42 request is otherwise refused. Consequently, the opponent will have one month from the date of this letter within which to file and serve a revised statement of opposition in accordance with today's grant of leave.\"\n\n[7]\nCan. Post's amended statement of opposition, contained a passage designated 1(f) which made no reference to s. 9 or to s. 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, and listed no official marks of which public notice had been given in the\nTrade Marks Journal\n. (Can. Post's motion record: p. 000115-16.) The paragraph designated 1(f) in the Can. Post's impugned statement of opposition, however, including the significant last five official marks therein listed, runs thus:\n\"1(f) The proposed trademark is not registrable because, contrary to paragraph 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, it is a mark the adoption of which is prohibited by s. 9 of the\nAct\n, in that it so nearly resembles that it is likely to be mistaken for the following official marks, public notice of which was given in the following issues of the\nTrade Marks Journal\n:\nOfficial Mark\nNumber\nNotice Date\nPriority Post - Poste Prioritaires\n900,671\nMay 1978\nIntelpost\n900,673\nApril 15, 1981\nAdmail\n900,674\nMay 20, 1981\nMediaposte & Design\n900,675\nFebruary 10, 1982\nAdmail & Design\n900,676\nApril 28, 1982\nMediaposte\n900,677\nFebruary 26, 1982\nElectronic Mail Courrier Electronique & Design\n900,678\nDecember 14, 1983\nCourrier Electronique\n900,679\nFebruary 22, 1984\nElectronic Mail\n900,680\nFebruary 22, 1984\nMailtrac\n900,681\nMay 2, 1984\nMessageries Poste Prioritaire\n900,682\nFebruary 2, 1984\nPriority Post Courier\n900,683\nFebruary 2, 1984\nSupermailbox\n903,039\nNovember 25, 1987\nMail Poste & Design\n903,803\nMarch 30, 1989\nPoste Mail & Design\n903,806\nMarch 30, 1989\nPoste Mail & Design\n903,807\nMarch 30, 1989\nPriority Courier\n903,973\nDecember 6, 1989\nMessageries Prioritaires\n903,974\nDecember 6, 1989\"\n\n[8]\nThe other proposed amendments rejected by the TMOB, are new paragraphs 1(c), (d), (e) and (g). They run as follows:\n\"(c) If the applicant uses the proposed trademark in association with the services set out in applicant's application, it would suggest that the use of such services has been authorized or approved by the opponent, or that such services are used in the business of the opponent, or that such services are of a kind similar or identical to services used in the business of the opponent. Such use would be without the written consent of the opponent and would be contrary to the provisions of the aforesaid\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, ss. 58(1) and (2). Accordingly, the application does not comply with s. 30(i) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, because the applicant could not, at the date of filing of the application, have been satisfied that it was entitled to use the trademark in Canada, since such use would be unlawful.\n\"(d) The applicant is not the person entitled to registration because, at the date of filing of the application, the applicant's trademark was confusing with the trademarks Mail Poste and Poste Mail & Designs, in respect of which applications for registration, Nos. 577,188 and 577,189, had been previously (on January 30, 1987) filed in Canada by the opponent, and which were pending at the date of advertisement of the applicant's application. These said applications were registered on October 27, 1989 as registration Nos. TMA 361,467 and TMA 361,468, respectively.\n\"(e) The applicant is not the person entitled to registration of the trademark because, at the date of filing of the application, it was confusing with the trademarks and trade names Canada Post Corporation, Canada Post and Post Office, Admail, Courrier Electronique, Electronic Mail Courrier Electronique & Design, Electronic Mail, Intelpost, Mailtrac, Mediaposte & Design, Mediaposte, Supermailbox, Mail Poste & Design, Poste Mail & Design, Priority Post, Postes Prioritaires, Messageries Poste Prioritaire, Priority Post Courier, Priority Courier and Messageries Prioritaires, all of which had been previously used in Canada by the opponent and/or its predecessor, Her Majesty in Right of Canada, acting as The Post Office Department.\n. . . . .\n\"(g) The trademark is not registrable, because contrary to paragraph 12(1)(e) of the\nAct\n, it is a mark the adoption of which is prohibited by s. 9(1)(d) of the\nAct\n, having regard to the aforesaid official marks, trademarks and trade names of the opponent, the applicant's trademark is likely to lead to the belief that services in associations with which it is proposed to be used have received or are produced, sold or performed under governmental patronage, approval or authority.\"\n\n[9]\nThere are proposed certain internal amendments to correct paragraph 1(i) of the opposition statement which is now proposed to appear as follows:\n\"(i) The opponent had not abandoned any of the trademarks, official marks and trade names referred to above at the date of advertisement of the applicant's application.\"\n\n[10]\nOn the issue of prejudice, if any, which may be suffered by the respective parties, it is true that this litigation does create some delay. However, at the best of times trademark opposition proceedings do not operate with vertiginous alacrity and since that seems to be nobody's fault, it is just accepted. In this regard, the court accepts the applicant's counsel's arguments to the effect that no prejudice can truly be alleged in that no witness has died leaving potential testimony unrecorded, no document has been lost and no respondent's mark has been infringed. In such circumstances prima facie valid amendments of the statement of opposition ought to be permitted. There would, however, arise serious prejudice to Can. Post if it were forever foreclosed from having its full opposition adjudicated only because of its solicitors' seeming somnolence.\n\n[11]\nCan. Post's counsel indicated, with great satisfaction and hope, the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board in application no. 593,671 for the trademark \"Datamail Canada\", filed by 690062 Ontario Limited. The decision is dated June 28, 1991. Can. Post is alleged to have prevailed on the merits, but the one-person opposition board wrote, at page 5 of the decision:\n\"The applicant [i.e. 690062 Ontario Limited] did not file evidence in support of its application. Both parties filed written arguments. The applicant's written argument is very brief. [Not an inherent fault!], and merely reiterates the denials and assertions in the counter statement. Only the opponent was represented at an oral hearing.\"\nAnd further it is stated on p. 7:\n\"Having regard to the above, I am satisfied that the opponent has adduced sufficient evidence to at least meet its initial burden with respect to supporting its ground of opposition that the applied for mark is not distinctive of the applicant's services.\n\"Considering that the applicant has not filed any evidence in support of its application, and that its written argument is not persuasive, I find that the applicant has not met the legal burden on it to establish that the applied for mark is distinctive of the applicant at the material date January 9, 1989. The opponent therefore succeeds on its ground of opposition denoted by 1(h). Consequently, the remaining grounds of opposition need not be considered.\n\"In view of the above, the applicant's application is refused.\"\n\n[12]\nThat disposition was not so much a prevailing on the merits on Can. Post's part as a prevailing almost by default. So it was, it seems, in regard to Can. Post's obtaining permission twice to amend its statement of opposition. The trademark applicant in that case never did object to such amendments. In the present circumstances, the significance of the \"Datamail Canada\" decision is not so great as counsel has urged.\n\n[13]\nOf considerably, if not crucially, greater significance in this case is the judgment of Halperin, J., of the Quebec Superior Court in\nSociété Canadienne des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  'mail', 'post' and 'post office' have in the experience of all, been associated with the only postal system we have ever known, [so] how can one conclude otherwise than by affirming that the use of [such] words ... 'suggest' that which is prohibited in subsections [sic] (a), (b) and (c) of s. 58(2)\" [of the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 54, now R.S.C. 1985, c. C-10]? The statement of opposition clearly ought to contain the reference to s. 58(1) and (2) of the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n(hereinafter\nC.P.C.A.\n) as expressed in paragraph 1(c) which the opponent seeks to emplace therein by means of the amendment which the opposition board has rejected. It ought to contain it, no matter the duration of time in which the opponent's solicitors were asleep on the job.\n\n[14]\nJolted awake also by their discovery of the opposition board member's 1990 decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  statement by inserting paragraph 1(g), and rightly so. Paragraph 1(g) is important in regard to the adoption of the official marks of which public notice has been given in the\nTrade Marks Journal\n, especially Supermailbox, No. 903-039, whose notice date was November 25, 1987. Paragraph 1(g) simply ought to be included in the opposition statement of this particular opponent, Can. Post, despite the length of time in which its solicitors were asleep on the job.\n\n[15]\nInasmuch as the opposition board in deciding\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  therefore gave utterly no consideration or effect to ss. 5(2)(e) and 19(1)(r), and ss. 23, 25, 56, 58 and 61 thereof, then that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case is wrongly decided. The TMOB has no right or jurisdiction simply to blink away solemnly enacted, statutory statements of public policy made by parliament in regard to the very subject before the board. The Registrar and the TMOB, like the Sovereign or like this court, are not above the law.\n\n[16]\nThe 1989 judgment of this court's appeal division in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  apparently dark sky of consciousness. It surely supports the proposed content configuration of paragraphs 1(e) and (f) as they are proposed by the opponent's solicitors. Such matters require the interpretation of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10, and of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, imported by Mr. Justice MacGuigan for a unanimous panel of the appeal division in December 1989. Consideration of the content of paragraphs 1(e) and (f) in the statement of opposition is (and always was) exacted by the virtually unique status of Can. Post, a public authority with its own statutory trademark protection over and above that which it may also invoke under the\nTrade Marks Act\n. Because of that virtually unique statutory status, Can. Post cannot logically suffer erosion of its paramount status under and by virtue of merely adjectival provisions in the\nTrade Marks Act\n. The provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\nmust be taken to be buttressed by the substantive provisions of the\nTrade Marks Act\nand must be respected as the authentic will of parliament in this regard.\n\n[17]\nAs noted, although the respondent herein generally alleges prejudice if the Can. Post's proposed amendments be permitted, no specific prejudice is demonstrated, apart from the effluxion of time, and the lack of compensatory costs in the opposition proceedings. If there be one sure aspect of opposition proceedings it is that they seem to take a long time, in any event, from whatever cause amply justifiable or otherwise. However the respondent's plight is not so terrible as its counsel would have the court believe, simply because in such proceeding the Registrar of Trademarks cannot award costs for or against any party in any event. That is not to say that this court is powerless to award costs in these proceedings, a matter to which the court will return later herein.\n\n[18]\nThe salient feature of Can. Post, its opposition to the respondent's trademark applications, and its appeal for permission to make even a second round of significant amendments to its opposition it its paramount statutory status, conferred by the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n. This factor pervades any and all cases in which Can. Post is involved in a trademark application or opposition. It is a matter of public policy and public order, which the TMOB is bound to respect.\n\n[19]\nLeaving aside for the moment those matters of public policy and public order emanating from Can. Post's special statutory status in regard to maintaining its corporate identity as an institution of the government of Canada, and as an agent of the Crown in right of Canada, one may find support for Can. Post's posture herein in ordinary jurisprudence applicable to ordinary litigants. Such support resides in the principles stated by the jurisprudence cited by Can. Post's counsel.\n\n[20]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Teitelbaum of this court, as reported, wrote:\n\"The courts should not intervene in the discretionary powers of the Registrar of Trademarks as given to him by the\nAct\nunless\nhe is clearly acting outside his jurisdiction or\nhe is\nacting '\nclearly wrong\nhaving regard to the facts'.\n\"This principle was enunciated by Mr. Justice Heald in the case of\nCentennial Grocery Brokers Ltd.\n[(1972), 5 C.P.R.(2d) 235, [1972] F.C. 257], at p. 239 C.P.R., p. 261 F.C., where Heald, J., states:\n'I should not interfere with the Registrar's exercise of discretion unless he was clearly wrong and I am not prepared to say that he was clearly wrong having regard to the facts in this case.'\n\"I do believe that the registrar was 'clearly wrong' in asking for further clarification of the reasons for the requested extension.\n\"The affidavit submitted on behalf of the respondent, the affidavit of Alan M. Troicuk dated April 8, 1986, states what the current practice of the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs is with regard to such applications.\n\"Paragraph 4 of the affidavit states what the procedure is:\n'It is also the practice of the Trademarks Office to consider up to the time of allowance any request for a retroactive extension of time under s. 46(2) of the\nTrade Marks Act\n. If material initially filed with the request is insufficient, the practice is to advise the requesting party of the statutory requirements for an extension and to ask the party to address these statutory requirements by way of an additional submission, which submission must be filed within a certain time frame.'\n\"It seems to me that this practice is ultimately fair. A person who may wish to oppose a trademark should be given every\nreasonable\nopportunity to do so within the confines of the\nAct\n.\" (Emphasis not in original text)\n\n[21]\nAccording to Mr. Justice Collier's judgment reported as\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 458, the Registrar's decision \"must be on proper legal principles, and in the interests of justice between the parties\"; but the court can interfere \"if it appears he [the Registrar or the TMOB] has proceeded upon improper or erroneous principles or\noverlooked an important matter\n\" (emphasis not in original text). Collier, J., was there considering the dispute of two wholly private litigants and not even one endowed with special statutory status which is of course \"an important matter\" not to be overlooked in cases like this one.\n\n[22]\nSo also stated Mr. Justice Dubé of this court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), thus:\n\"Again it is not for the court to substitute its own decision to that of the Registrar. The court may only move and exercise its own discretion where all the facts were not before the Registrar, or\nwhere he did not take into account all the relevant factors\n, or where there is an error of fact or of law on the face of the record, or where procedural irregularities may have influenced the final determination of the decision, or where a decision is scandalous, or frivolous, or bereft of any sound or objective motive.\" (He cited much jurisprudence in support.)\n\n[23]\nHere was a case of a private opponent, without any special status, par excellence, for Dubé, J., noted at the end of his reasons:\n\"The crux of the argument of the appellant is that it is not reasonable to require 'small and unsophisticated' companies to subscribe to the\nTrade Marks Journal\nor to engage a trademark agent to review the\nTrade Marks Journal\non their behalf. Obviously, that argument has no merit. A notice in the\nTrade Marks Journal\nis proper, legal notice to the world. The Registrar cannot be expected to grant special dispenses to small and unsophisticated companies. Indeed, such an exercise of discretion on his part would be quickly challenged by those who have acted in a timely fashion in accordance with the\nAct\n.\"\nIngredients there, were not present in the case at bar: here, \"taking into account all the relevant factors\", must include respecting Can. Post's special statutory status, a status of which Kitchen Craft Connection Inc. could not boast, leaving it bereft in the circumstances, for the same stated principles apply here as well as there, even although the facts and factors differ.\n\n[24]\nSo it is, in consonance with the pervasive principle, the court must ask: \"Did the Registrar err in law or apply any wrong principle?\" as stated by Mr. Justice Mahoney in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at p. 56 for a unanimous Appeal Division of this court. There was a case establishing that whether or not to grant an extension of time to an ordinary opponent under s. 46 of the\nAct\nis very much a matter of the Registrar's discretion. The opponent there, Star-Kist, was very much an ordinary opponent without special statutory status.\n\n[25]\nIt is quite apparent that while the principle is constant the facts and factors may vary so markedly as to produce entirely opposite conclusions. Thus, Mr. Justice Rouleau, whose decision in\nStar-Kist\nwas unanimously upheld by the Appeal Division, came to an opposite conclusion in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 7 F.T.R. 149 (F.C.T.D.), at p. 130 where he is reported to have written:\n\"In situations where discretionary powers are exercised without having regard to all relevant facts or where there may be an error on the face of the record, or there exists a procedural irregularity which eventually had an influence on the final determination made by the decision-maker, the exercise of that discretion should be subject to review by the court in its supervisory capacity.\nIf the disregard for the facts\nor the overlooking of some procedure\nwas a relative factor in determining the outcome\n, the court should exercise its discretion and set aside the decision or order.\" (Emphasis not in original text)\nAlways, due attention to, and respect for, the facts and factors are essential to the orientation of the outcome, even between ordinary litigants, for the operation of the principle remains constant. Different circumstances in the constant principle's operation will dictate different outcomes. In this case, the circumstances dictate the success of this motion and permission once again, to amend the statement of opposition, as Can. Post proposes.\n\n[26]\nWhat is so out-of-the-ordinary, so special is, as previously above mentioned, Can. Post's special statutory status. It is described in the\nCanada Post Corporation Act\n, above cited (and hereinafter cited R.S.C. 1985, c. C-10). The provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\naffect and augment Can. Post's status of opponent in trademark proceedings, because the right of corporate identity pervades Can. Post's special monopolistic status. That places it in a more favourable position than that of ordinary parties to such proceedings.\n\n[27]\nHere are some salient, pertinent provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, viewed apart from the overall scope of status and recognition carved for Can. Post generally by the very existence of the\nAct\n. Emphasis is added.\n\"2(1) In this Act,\n. . . . .\n'\nCorporation\n' means the Canada\nPost\nCorporation established by s. 4;\n'\nmail\n' [the noun, not the verb] means\nmailable matter\nfrom the time it is posted to the time it is delivered to the addressee thereof;\n'\nmail bag\n' means any container or covering in which mail is transmitted, whether it contains\nmail\nor not;\n'\nmail contractor\n' means a person who has entered into a contract with the Corporation for the\ntransmission of mail\n, which contract has not expired or been terminated;\n'\nmail conveyance\n' means any physical, electronic, optical or other means used to transmit mail;\n'\nmailable matter\n' means any message, information, funds or goods that may be transmitted by\npost\n; [the noun, not the verb]\n. . . . .\n'\npost\n' [the verb, not the noun] means to leave in a\npost office\nor with a person authorized by the Corporation to receive mailable matter;\n'\npost office\n' includes any place, receptacle, device or mail conveyance authorized by the Corporation for the\nposting\n[the verb's gerund], receipt, sorting, handling, transmission or delivery of mail;\n'\npostage\n' means the charge or surcharge payable for the collection, transmission and delivery by the Corporation of messages, information, funds or goods and for insurance or other special services provided by the Corporation in relation thereto;\n'\npostage stamp\n' means any stamp, postage impression or postage meter impression authorized by the Corporation for the purpose of paying postage;\n'\npostage remittance\n' means any instrument authorized by the Corporation for the remittance of funds;\n. . . . .\n'\ntransmit\n' means to send or convey from one place to another place by any physical, electronic, optical or other means;\n'\ntransmit by post\n' [the noun] means to transmit through or by means of the Corporation.\n. . . . .\n\"(2) For the purposes of this Act,\n(a) leaving\nmail\nat the place of residence or business of the addressee thereof,\n(b) depositing\nmail\nin a\npost office\nlock box or rural mail box or any other receptacle or device provided for the receipt of\nmail\nof the addressee, or\n(c)\nleaving mail\nwith the addressee or his servant or agent or with any other person who may reasonably be considered to be authorized to receive\nmail\nby the addressee thereof,\naccording to the usual manner of delivering\nmail\nto that addressee, is deemed to be delivery to the addressee.\n\"(3) For the purposes of this Act, a thing is deemed to be in the course of\npost\nfrom the time it is posted to the time it is delivered to the addressee or returned to the sender thereof.\n\"3. This act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province.\n. . . . .\nObjects\n\"5(1) The objects of the Corporation are\n(a) to establish and operate a\npostal service\nfor the collection, transmission and delivery of messages, information, funds and goods both within Canada and between Canada and places outside Canada;\n(b) to manufacture and provide such products and to provide such services as are, in the opinion of the Corporation, necessary or incidental to the\npostal service\nprovided by the Corporation; and\n(c)\nto provide\nto or on behalf of departments and agencies of, and corporations owned, controlled or operated by, the government of Canada or any provincial, regional or municipal government in Canada or to any person\nservices that, in the opinion of the Corporation, are capable of being conveniently provided in the course of carrying out the other objects of the Corporation\n.\n\"(2) While maintaining basic customary\npostal service\n, the Corporation, in carrying out its objects, shall have regard to\n(a) the desirability of improving and\nextending its\nproducts and\nservices in the light of developments in the field of communications\n;\n(b) the\nneed to conduct its operations on a self-sustaining basis\nwhile providing a standard of service that will meet the needs of the people of Canada and that is similar with respect to communities of the same size;\n(c) the need to conduct its operations in such manner as will best provide for the security of\nmail\n;\n. . . . .\n(e) the\nneed to maintain a corporate identity program\napproved by the Governor-in-Council that reflects the role of the\nCorporation as an institution of the government of Canada\n.\n. . . . .\nExclusive Privilege of Corporation\n\"14(1) Subject to s. 15, the Corporation has the\nsole and exclusive privilege\nof collecting, transmitting and delivering letters to the addressee thereof within Canada.\n. . . . .\nPowers\n\"16(1) In carrying out its objects and duties under this Act, the Corporation has the capacity, and subject to this Act, the rights, powers and privileges of a natural person.\n\"(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the\nCorporation may acquire, hold, lease, sell or dispose of any\nreal or\npersonal property\n.\n. . . . .\nRegulations\n\"19(1) The Corporation may, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, make regulations for the efficient operation of the business of the Corporation and for carrying the purposes and provisions of this Act into effect, and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may make regulations\n. . . . .\n(b) classifying mailable matter, including the\nsetting of standards\nfor any class thereof;\n(c) prescribing the conditions under which mailable matter may be\ntransmitted by post\n;\n. . . . .\n(k) governing the\ndesign\n, placement and use of\nany receptacle or device\nintended for the posting, insertion, reception, storage, transmission or delivery of mailable matter;\n. . . . .\n(n) regulating or prohibiting the\nmaking or printing of postage impressions\n;\n. . . . .\n(s) providing for the operation of any\nservices\nor systems established\npursuant to this Act\n.\n. . . . .\nStatus of Corporation\n\"23.

In any prosecution under this Act, evidence that anything bears the words '\nPost Office\n', '\nCanada Post Office\n', '\nCanada Mail\n', '\nCanada Post\n', '\nCanada Post Corporation\n', or\nany similar expression\nis evidence that the thing was established or authorized for use in connection with the Corporation by this Act or the regulations.\"\n\n[28]\nThe applicant is a very special entity enjoying a very special status accorded by parliament, of which the TMOB is bound to take notice. That special legislated status refers to Can. Post's corporate identity, the monopoly accorded to it in any word or mark suggesting its activities, and the penal consequences to be inflicted on anyone who violates or infringes upon that monopoly.\n\n[29]\nThe incidents of parliament's special regard for, and statutory protection of Can. Post abound in the\nC.P.C.A.\nand are especially noticeable in the above recited passages. The definitions, especially those of \"mail\", \"mailable matter\" and \"transmit by post\", virtually equate Can. Post with the notions of \"mail or mailing\" and \"post or posting\" of \"any message, information, funds or goods which may be transmitted by post\". These are matters of public policy and public order, because parliament enacted that the\nC.P.C.A.\n\"is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province\". It is a primary statutory mandate of Can. Post to establish and operate a postal service, and it enjoys, also by statute the sole and exclusive privilege of collecting, transmitting and delivering letters in Canada. In the English-language version of s. 5(2) of the\nAct\n, the desirability and the need of certain activities are delineated; but the maintenance of a corporate identity program is legislated as a\nneed\nof this corporation Canada Post, which is an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada, and which is so durable that it cannot be wound up, unless parliament makes special provision.\n\n[30]\nEven if the issues in this case were being litigated by two wholly private contenders for the property rights accorded by a trademark, even without Can. Post on one side, it would transpire that the appropriate date for consideration of the grounds of opposition pursuant to s. 12(1)(d) of the\nTrade Marks Act\nwould be the date upon which the TMOB, delegated by the Registrar, disposed of the opposition on the evidence adduced, That day has not yet dawned. Such principle was enunciated in the recent unanimous decision of this court's Appeal Division, written by Madam Justice Desjardins for release on June 24, 1991, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). This case supports Can. Post's position that the TMOB erred in law in refusing the amendment whereby the applicant (Can. Post) sought to rely on s. 9 marks and registered trademarks of Can. Post which were published and registered respectively, after the date of filing of the opposition. Indeed, this tolls as an error in law underlying the decision attached herein. It certainly so tolls in regard to Can. Post's special status.\n\n[31]\nIn terms of Can. Post's monopoly and identity, ss. 58, 60 and 61 of the\nAct\ndemonstrate how parliament cherishes, protects and cossets Can. Post, to the extent of criminalizing any activities which falsely proclaim \"post office\" or merely suggest, by any word or mark, that they operate as if approved by the corporation or use things similar to that which it uses in its business. Criminal sanctions are the State's heavy artillery, especially when prosecutable on indictment as potentially are the hybrid offences denounced in s. 60 of the\nC.P.C.A.\nThese, too, are matters of public policy and public order. In that regard the Registrar of Trademarks, and his delegate the TMOB, must understand or be made to realize that they, in common with everyone else, cannot lawfully authorize anyone, including anyone to whom they would issue a trademark, to commit a criminal offence by such means. An issued trademark does not operate to excuse conduct made criminal by the\nC.P.C.A.\n\n[32]\nPublic policy surely overrides all private individuals' or corporations' claimed proprietary interest in a trademark, as a matter of public order. In regard to statutory interpretation, then, the\nC.P.C.A.\non its plane of public policy cannot be held to be useless and fruitless legislation:\nInutilis labor et sine fructus non est effectus legis\n; or, more concisely received from ancient principle:\nLex nil frustra facit\n, meaning that the protection provided to Can. Post cannot be taken to have been enacted in vain.\n\n[33]\nIn light of Can. Post's extraordinarily special status conferred by parliament, the corporation cannot lawfully be prevented, on the TMOB's discretion under the rules, from evincing all of its enormous statutory importance in specific regard to Can. Post's marks and words of corporate identity, by refusing the amendments to its statement of opposition just as if Can. Post were an ordinary individual or corporation. Put another way, the law exacts that Can. Post be enabled to evince its special status regarding it corporate identity in order that the TMOB have fully for consideration Can. Post's exertion of its monopoly, status and identity in opposition to anyone and everyone who or which would seek to become the registered holder of trademarks similar to, or even suggesting those of Can. Post, for such marks fall under the ban of outlawry imposed by the specific and general provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n.\n\n[34]\nIndeed, it is the lawful duty of Can. Post, in regard to the statutory\nneed to maintain a corporate identity program\n, expressed in s. 5(2) of the\nAct\n, to defend and to assert its monopoly in its trademarks, interests and trademark oppositions. This is clearly so, even if its solicitors were asleep on the job, for their dilatoriness cannot conceivably override the plain imperatives of public order and public policy enunciated in the above cited provisions of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, unless the statute so conceded, that which it does not do.\n\n[35]\nStatutes of public order are most relevantly considered, albeit from a different base of view, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> where at page 19 Mr. Justice Taschereau is reported as having written about the\nArchitects' law\n, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 272:\n\"This law is not only a law of public order, but it is also a prohibitive law carrying a penalty. It is not necessary, I believe, to write a long dissertation to demonstrate that in principle laws of this type entail nullity even though it is not declared there. (C.C. 14) (Mignault, vol. 1, p. 123.) The defendant could obviously invoke this nullity and have it noted by the courts.\"\nSo it is also with the\nC.P.C.A.\n, a statute of public order which also carries prohibitions of breaches of its provisions under pain of penalties. The TMOB simply must take respectful notice of that statute. Not to do so is an error in law.\n\n[36]\nThus, the tardiness in expressing grounds of opposition which could foreclose an ordinary opponent, simply cannot prevail against Can. Post, which, by virtue of the explicit and implicit imperatives of the\nC.P.C.A.\n, must be accorded the right and privilege of making a full opposition answer whether timely or tardy.\n\n[37]\nThere is no prejudice nor additional expense for the private respondent (trademark applicant) in this regard in relation to proceedings under the\nTrade Marks Act\n. If there be any prejudice at all, it resides in the private respondent's seeking, perhaps, to acquire that which parliament has so clearly accorded and reserved to Can. Post under the\nC.P.C.A.\nThat is a matter which can be determined by the TMOB, but after Can. Post's imperative opposition grounds, created and promoted by the\nC.P.C.A.\n, are fully articulated for the attention of the TMOB.\n\n[38]\nThe applicant, Can. Post, is entitled to amend its statement of opposition in the manner proposed. The TMOB's exercise of discretion to refuse such amendments manifests an error in law, that is, misinterpretation of the effect and weight of\nCanada Post Corporation Act\nin making imperative the articulation of Can. Post's special status and interest in its statement of opposition.\n\n[39]\nNow, there exists a small dilemma in regard to awarding costs of these proceedings. Counsel for Can. Post argues that his client ought not to have to pay a penny in costs. That may be so, and of course its dilatory somnolent solicitors can always indemnify and save harmless their client in regard to costs, if they wish. It was they, in the first instance who did not realize the full import of Can. Post's extraordinary special statutory status in regard to its property in its corporate identity. Such realization, of course, ought to have dawned on the TMOB, and of course, the solicitors for the private respondent, too. However that respondent, even if properly advised by its solicitors, is less to blame for resisting Can. Post's application for judicial review, than Can. Post is, through its in-house counsel and outside solicitors, for failing to articulate its opposition to the trademark applications and indeed failing to perform its statutory duty in that regard ab initio. These reasons apply to all of Can. Post's various applications to quash the TMOB's refusal of its proposed amendments. Therefore, it appears just to this court to award the unsuccessful private respondent full party-and-party costs forthwith after taxation against the victorious Can. Post in this proceeding; and full disbursements but one-third counsel fees only in the following proceedings: T-1603-91, T-1606-91, T-1607-91 and T-1608-91.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Steven C.

        "The proposed ground of opposition based on s. 9(1)(d) was available to the Applicant from the outset and the delay in raising it is unjustified.",
        "The amendments to paragraphs 1(e) and 1(f) lack proper support and justification.",

        "Allowing the amendments at this late stage would be prejudicial to the Respondent’s case, as evidence was filed based on the original pleadings.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The core issue revolved around the Opposition Board’s refusal to allow Canada Post Corporation (Can. Post) to amend its statement of opposition to trademark applications. The court found the Board’s refusal constituted an error in law.",
      "The court heavily emphasized Can. Post’s unique statutory status under the *Canada Post Corporation Act* (C.P.C.A.). It determined the Board failed to adequately consider the implications of this status, particularly Can. Post’s monopoly on postal services and the legal protections afforded its corporate identity.",
      "The court reasoned that the C.P.C.A. grants Can. Post a special position, including exclusive rights related to terms like “post” and “mail,” and criminal penalties for unauthorized use suggesting affiliation with Can. Post. The Board’s refusal to allow amendments asserting these rights was deemed a misinterpretation of the law.",
      "The court acknowledged Can. Post’s initial delay in bringing forth certain grounds of opposition due to solicitor error but held that this delay should not preclude Can. Post from fully articulating its statutory rights, given its unique position and the public policy considerations involved.",
      "The court interpreted relevant case law (e.g., *Société Canadienne des*, *Allied*, *Star-Kist*) to support the principle that the Registrar/Opposition Board’s discretion is not unlimited and must be exercised within the bounds of the law, especially when a party possesses a special statutory status.",
      "The court found that the Board erred by focusing on potential prejudice to the applicant (trademark seeker) and failing to adequately consider the prejudice to Can. Post if it were prevented from fully asserting its statutory rights. The court determined that the lack of demonstrable prejudice to the applicant outweighed the concerns about delay.",
      "The court applied the principle that statutes of public order should not be rendered meaningless. It reasoned that denying Can. Post the ability to assert its statutory rights would effectively undermine the purpose of the C.P.C.A.",
      "The court determined that the amendments sought by Can. Post were necessary to ensure the Opposition Board had a complete understanding of the legal issues, particularly concerning Can. Post’s exclusive privileges and the potential for trademark infringement to violate the C.P.C.A.",
      "While acknowledging Can. Post’s solicitor’s negligence contributed to the situation, the court held that this did not justify denying Can. Post the opportunity to fully present its case, given its unique statutory position and the public policy implications."

      "The applicant, Can. Post, is entitled to amend its statement of opposition in the manner proposed.",
