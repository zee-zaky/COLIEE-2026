Marchildon.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n This appeal was heard at Toronto, Ontario, on March 6, 1996, by Reed, J., of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n Reed, J., delivered the following decision on March 12, 1996, at Ottawa, Ontario.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>     <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[1] \n   \n Reed, J. \n : This is an appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trademarks, rejecting the opposition of the appellant to the registration of \"Sugarplum Fairy\" as a trademark.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[2] \n  The appellant owns the registered trademark \"Sugar Plum\". It is registered for use in connection with \"sliced and prepared meats\" and with \"poultry\". The respondent, Tammy L. Marchildon (hereinafter \"the respondent\"), seeks registration of the trademark \"Sugarplum Fairy\", for use in connection with \"candy\" and \"catering services\". She has been using this mark since 1989 in connection with the sale of candy packaged in wine glasses, which are then placed in decorative boxes. These are sold as gift items to corporations and speciality food stores. The appellant's registered mark has been used in connection with sliced and prepared meats, including bacon and hams, since 1965. It has been used in connection with poultry since 1971. These products are sold to consumers in supermarkets and retail grocery stores.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[3] \n  The appellant challenges the Registrar's decision on the grounds that: (1) he improperly evaluated the evidence (e.g., he should have found the appellant's mark highly distinctive instead of possessing only a fair degree of inherent distinctiveness); (2) he failed to apply the correct burden of proof and treated an absence of evidence as operating in favour of the respondent's position; (3) he should have reached a conclusion, on the basis of all the evidence, that the respondent had not discharged the burden on her of proving that her mark was not confusing with the appellant's registered trademark, refer to s. 12(1)(d) of the  \n Trade-marks Act \n , R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[4] \n  The proper test to be applied by this court on appeals from the Registrar of Trademarks was recently considered in  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). I adopt the statement set out therein for present purposes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[5] \n  I turn then to the Registrar's decision. The test for confusion is described in s. 6 of the  \n Trade-marks Act \n . Factors to be considered, in making an assessment as to whether two marks are confusing, are set out in s. 6(5) thereof: the inherent distinctiveness of the marks; the length of time each has been in use; the nature of the wares, services or business; the nature of the trade; the degree of resemblance in appearance or sound of the marks or in the ideas suggested by them. This list is not exhaustive; all relevant factors are to be considered. All factors do not necessarily have equal weight. The weight to be given to each depends on the circumstances (see  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 239 (T.D.), at 249.  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at 137).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[6] \n  Counsel argues that the Registrar erred in concluding that the appellant's mark possessed a \"fair degree of inherent distinctiveness\" and in concluding that the mark \"would have become known to a fair extent in Canada\". Counsel argues that the Registrar should have found that the mark had a high degree of inherent distinctiveness and was widely known in Canada. Counsel also argues that the Registrar erred in concluding that the respondent's mark possesses \"some inherent distinctiveness\" as a result of the use of the word \"Fairy\" as part of that mark.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[7] \n  I do not find the Registrar's conclusions to be unwarranted or incorrect. The use of comparative terms such as \"some\", \"fair\", \"considerable\", \"high\", is not governed by reference to a rigid quantitative standard. The Registrar undoubtedly has, as a result of his continuing experience in this area, a conceptual framework by reference to which he chooses one modifier, rather than another, as applicable to a given set of facts. I could not on the basis of the evidence find that he was wrong in describing the appellant's mark as he did. With respect to the reference to the use of the word \"Fairy\", as being relevant to the distinctiveness of the respondent's mark, I understand the Registrar to be saying that while \"Sugar Plum\" has a close nexus to candy when the word \"Fairy\" is added, so that the mark becomes \"Sugarplum Fairy\", distinctiveness arises vis-à-vis the application of that mark to candy. I share that view.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[8] \n  The Registrar recognized that the appellant's mark would be better known in Canada as a result of its long usage and because of the sales and advertising by the appellant of its products. He also recognized that insofar as the respective lengths of time the two marks had been in use, before the relevant date, this was a factor which clearly weighed in the appellant's favour. These conclusions are unassailable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[9] \n  I turn then to the Registrar's analysis of the nature of the wares and services and the nature of the trade relevant to the products to which the two marks relate. He concluded that the wares are intrinsically different, even though they might be said to fit within the same broad classification of foodstuffs. He noted that while the respondent was not now selling her gift packaged candy to supermarkets and grocery stores, she might expand her business to do so. He noted that insofar as catering services are concerned, there might be a connection between the appellant's meat product business and catering services because such services use meat products. At the same time, he stated that since there was no evidence that wholesale or retail meat suppliers would ordinarily be engaged in catering services, as an ancillary business, or conversely, that caterers would be involved in selling meat products at the wholesale or retail level, as an ancillary business, he assumed that the respondent's catering services would not be a natural extension of the appellant's business. Counsel argues that this conclusion was incorrect in law because an absence of evidence should have weighed in the appellant's favour.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[10] \n  Counsel referred to:  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at 55;  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at 188;  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M. Opp. B.), at 145;  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M. Opp. B.), at 409. While the burden of proof, after all the evidence has been weighed, rests with the respondent (the applicant before the Registrar), an absence of evidence with respect to any given fact does not have to be treated as favouring the appellant (objector before the Registrar). With respect to the factual situation under consideration, if catering services are not ordinarily engaged in by wholesale and retail meat suppliers as an ancillary business, there will be no evidence. To expect the respondent to prove such absence is not reasonable. I do not think the Registrar erred in saying that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, he was entitled to assume that catering services were not normally an ancillary business for wholesale and retail meat suppliers. He recognized that \"at the end of the day\", so to speak, the burden of proving her case rested with the applicant before him. I share the Registrar's analysis with respect to the relative nature of the wares, services and trades and his conclusion as to the inference to be drawn from the absence of any evidence that catering services were an ancillary business of retail and wholesale meat suppliers.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[11] \n  With respect to the degree of resemblance in appearance, sound and the ideas suggested by the two marks, the Registrar noted that there was a resemblance both visually and aurally between them but that the ideas suggested by the two are quite different. My assessment does not differ. The marks  \n are \n  similar in appearance and aurally. They do invoke, however, different ideas. Sugarplums are candies. They are described in the  \n Oxford English Dictionary \n  as \"a small round or oval sweetmeat, made of boiled sugar and variously flavoured and coloured\". In the phrase \"Sugarplum Fairy\", the dominant concept, the noun, is the word \"fairy\". The words \"sugar plum\" modify or describe that noun. The definition of fairy found in the  \n Oxford English Dictionary \n  is \"one of a class of supernatural beings of diminutive size, in popular belief supposed to possess magical powers and to have great influence for good or evil over the affairs of men\". A sugarplum fairy would clearly be a benevolent as apposed to a malevolent being.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
    "[12] \n  In conclusion, weighing the totality of the evidence, I could not find that the Registrar erred. I would not come to any different decision myself.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n Appeal dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n Editor: Jean Merlini/slm  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [End of document]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"

I adopt the statement set out therein for present purposes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[5] \n  I turn then to the Registrar's decision. The test for confusion is described in s. 6 of the  \n Trade-marks Act \n . Factors to be considered, in making an assessment as to whether two marks are confusing, are set out in s. 6(5) thereof: the inherent distinctiveness of the marks; the length of time each has been in use; the nature of the wares, services or business; the nature of the trade; the degree of resemblance in appearance or sound of the marks or in the ideas suggested by them. This list is not exhaustive; all relevant factors are to be considered. All factors do not necessarily have equal weight. The weight to be given to each depends on the circumstances (see  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 239 (T.D.), at 249.  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at 137).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[6] \n  Counsel argues that the Registrar erred in concluding that the appellant's mark possessed a \"fair degree of inherent distinctiveness\" and in concluding that the mark \"would have become known to a fair extent in Canada\". Counsel argues that the Registrar should have found that the mark had a high degree of inherent distinctiveness and was widely known in Canada. Counsel also argues that the Registrar erred in concluding that the respondent's mark possesses \"some inherent distinctiveness\" as a result of the use of the word \"Fairy\" as part of that mark.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[7] \n  I do not find the Registrar's conclusions to be unwarranted or incorrect. The use of comparative terms such as \"some\", \"fair\", \"considerable\", \"high\", is not governed by reference to a rigid quantitative standard. The Registrar undoubtedly has, as a result of his continuing experience in this area, a conceptual framework by reference to which he chooses one modifier, rather than another, as applicable to a given set of facts. I could not on the basis of the evidence find that he was wrong in describing the appellant's mark as he did. With respect to the reference to the use of the word \"Fairy\", as being relevant to the distinctiveness of the respondent's mark, I understand the Registrar to be saying that while \"Sugar Plum\" has a close nexus to candy when the word \"Fairy\" is added, so that the mark becomes \"Sugarplum Fairy\", distinctiveness arises vis-à-vis the application of that mark to candy. I share that view.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[8] \n  The Registrar recognized that the appellant's mark would be better known in Canada as a result of its long usage and because of the sales and advertising by the appellant of its products. He also recognized that insofar as the respective lengths of time the two marks had been in use, before the relevant date, this was a factor which clearly weighed in the appellant's favour. These conclusions are unassailable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[9] \n  I turn then to the Registrar's analysis of the nature of the wares and services and the nature of the trade relevant to the products to which the two marks relate. He concluded that the wares are intrinsically different, even though they might be said to fit within the same broad classification of foodstuffs. He noted that while the respondent was not now selling her gift packaged candy to supermarkets and grocery stores, she might expand her business to do so. He noted that insofar as catering services are concerned, there might be a connection between the appellant's meat product business and catering services because such services use meat products. At the same time, he stated that since there was no evidence that wholesale or retail meat suppliers would ordinarily be engaged in catering services, as an ancillary business, or conversely, that caterers would be involved in selling meat products at the wholesale or retail level, as an ancillary business, he assumed that the respondent's catering services would not be a natural extension of the appellant's business. Counsel argues that this conclusion was incorrect in law because an absence of evidence should have weighed in the appellant's favour.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[10] \n  Counsel referred to:  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at 55;  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at 188;  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M. Opp. B.), at 145;  \n  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M. Opp. B.), at 409. While the burden of proof, after all the evidence has been weighed, rests with the respondent (the applicant before the Registrar), an absence of evidence with respect to any given fact does not have to be treated as favouring the appellant (objector before the Registrar). With respect to the factual situation under consideration, if catering services are not ordinarily engaged in by wholesale and retail meat suppliers as an ancillary business, there will be no evidence. To expect the respondent to prove such absence is not reasonable. I do not think the Registrar erred in saying that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, he was entitled to assume that catering services were not normally an ancillary business for wholesale and retail meat suppliers. He recognized that \"at the end of the day\", so to speak, the burden of proving her case rested with the applicant before him. I share the Registrar's analysis with respect to the relative nature of the wares, services and trades and his conclusion as to the inference to be drawn from the absence of any evidence that catering services were an ancillary business of retail and wholesale meat suppliers.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[11] \n  With respect to the degree of resemblance in appearance, sound and the ideas suggested by the two marks, the Registrar noted that there was a resemblance both visually and aurally between them but that the ideas suggested by the two are quite different. My assessment does not differ. The marks  \n are \n  similar in appearance and aurally. They do invoke, however, different ideas. Sugarplums are candies. They are described in the  \n Oxford English Dictionary \n  as \"a small round or oval sweetmeat, made of boiled sugar and variously flavoured and coloured\". In the phrase \"Sugarplum Fairy\", the dominant concept, the noun, is the word \"fairy\". The words \"sugar plum\" modify or describe that noun. The definition of fairy found in the  \n Oxford English Dictionary \n  is \"one of a class of supernatural beings of diminutive size, in popular belief supposed to possess magical powers and to have great influence for good or evil over the affairs of men\". A sugarplum fairy would clearly be a benevolent as apposed to a malevolent being.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>\n\n[12] \n  In conclusion, weighing the totality of the evidence, I could not find that the Registrar erred. I would not come to any different decision myself.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n Appeal dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n Editor: Jean Merlini/slm  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \n [End of document]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>",
