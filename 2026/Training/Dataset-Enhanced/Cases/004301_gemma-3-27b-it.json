    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC)\nMLB unedited judgment\n[English language version follows French language version]\n[La version anglaise vient à la suite de la version française]\nKonstantin Samsonov (partie demanderesse) v. Le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration (partie défenderesse)\n(IMM-223-06; 2006 CF 1158; 2006 FC 1158)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nRouleau, J.\nSeptember 29, 2006.\nCounsel:\nMarie-Hélène Giroux, for the applicant;\nCaroline Doyon, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nMonterosse Giroux s.e.n.c., Montréal, Québec, for the applicant;\nJohn H. Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nJudge Rouleau\n: This is an application for judicial review of the negative decision of an immigration officer against the applicant's application for visa waiver based on humanitarian considerations (CH application) dated December 8, 2005.",
    "[2]\nThe applicant is a 26-year-old citizen of Russia. He left Russia on August 24, 1999, and went to study in the United States until December 9, 2001.",
    "[3]\nHe arrived in Canada on December 29, 2001, and filed a refugee claim. The Refugee Protection Division denied this claim on July 8, 2002. The pre-removal risk assessment filed by the applicant on December 12, 2003, was refused on April 15, 2004.",
    "[4]\nOn May 12, 2003, the applicant filed an application based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations (HC application) on the grounds that his father was sick and that he had to take care of him, that his father and his wife were in Canada and that he owned a construction company that employed several Canadians.",
    "[5]\nOn December 8, 2005, the applicants HC application was refused.",
    "[6]\nThe officer determined that the information filed in support of the HC application did not establish that the applicant would encounter unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship by filing his permanent residence application in the usual fashion, i.e. from outside Canada.",
    "[7]\nThe respondent raised a preliminary question regarding the evidence submitted by the applicant in support of his application for judicial review. It is well settled in the case law that the judicial review of a decision must be based only on the evidence before the decision-maker:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 52 at paragraph 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). Yet, exhibits D-1, D-2, D-3, D-6, D-7 and D-8 submitted in support of the applicants affidavit are dated after the officers decision on the HC application. This Court cannot consider this new evidence that was not before the officer.",
    "[8]\nThe applicant is seeking to have this decision set aside on two grounds: first, the officers decision was based on an erroneous finding of fact, made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before him, in finding that his departure from Canada would not cause him or his family undue hardship and, second, the officer did not respect the procedural fairness requirements in refusing the applicants exemption application, when the officer admitted that he did not have enough evidence before him to determine the state of his fathers health or the size of his construction business.",
    "[9]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada determined that the standard of review for HC decisions is that of reasonableness simpliciter. An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraphs 100 to 103.",
    "[10]\nAs to the second issue in dispute, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that when it comes to a question of procedural fairness, the standard of review does not apply: Canadian Union of Public Employees ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 100 to 103.",
    "[11]\nThe applicant submitted that the officers decision is not reasonable because:\n the officer should have inferred from the very nature of the ties existing between an individual and his father or his wife that hardship would be caused by such a separation;\n the fact of being separated from his dying father and his wife is a humanitarian and compassionate consideration which justifies granting a visa exemption application;\n the officer was satisfied that his father was sick and that he was well integrated in Canadian society, he ought to have found that there were humanitarian and compassionate considerations.",
    "[12]\nI agree with the respondent that the applicants arguments are no more than an expression of his disagreement with the assessment of various pieces of evidence the officer had before him in making his decision. It is not the role of this Court to substitute a new assessment of this evidence for the officers decision.",
    "[13]\nThe officer expressed the opinion that the evidence filed by the applicant did not establish how it would cause him unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he were to file his permanent residence application from outside Canada. With respect to the submissions made by the applicant regarding his sick father, the officer wrote the following:\nRepresentations indicate that the father is sick and needs care and that the applicant came to Canada to aid his sick father. The applicant indicates that his father will face certain death if returned to the Russian Federation because the father would not be able to find adequate treatment. The particular current health condition and specific care that the father needs is not clear  insufficient details. The possibility that the father may be removed from Canada and may not be able to find adequate health treatment in Russia is beyond the scope of the current H and C request of the applicant.\n(Officers file notes, page 5)",
    "[14]\nAlthough the applicant is now alleging that his father is dying, there is no evidence in the record establishing that he submitted supporting evidence in his HC application confirming and substantiating this allegation. In this case, I agree with the respondent that the applicant cannot validly allege that the officer did not consider his fathers illness as an unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship when he failed to submit evidence in support of his claim.",
    "[15]\nConcernant le niveau détablissement du demandeur au Canada, lagent a conclu :\nIndications cited for showing his establishment are that he owns his own construction business that he says employs many Canadians and that he works full-time. There are few details about who precisely the applicant employs in his company to show the economic benefit of his company.\nThe applicant has been in Canada for nearly four years. The applicant has advanced greatly in adapting to Canadian society, working and becoming economically self-sufficient. However, his departure from Canada would not appear to create a disproportionate hardship for him or anyone else. Although the applicant has close family in Canada it is uncertain what long-term Immigration status they might obtain to remain permanently in Canada. The applicant has not adequately shown the nature and substance of his relationship with his wife or his father in such a way that a separation between himself and his wife or between the applicant and his father would cause an excessive or undue hardship if the applicant were required to depart Canada.\nThe information presented has not sufficiently shown that the applicants absence from Canada would cause an unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship for him, his family or persons in Canada. (Notes au dossier de lagent, page 6)",
    "[16]\nUnfortunately for the applicant, even though the officer determined that he had made considerable progress adapting to Canadian society and that he was working and had become financially self-sufficient, those factors alone were not enough for the officer to determine that there were humanitarian and compassionate grounds.",
    "[17]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), this Court stated that . . . although the Guidelines with respect to Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds are not binding, they nevertheless clearly indicate that self-sufficiency does not, in itself, guarantee or lead to a positive outcome in a humanitarian and compassionate grounds application . . .(at paragraph 20). There must be other factors supporting such a finding, the pivotal factor being whether . . . unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be caused to the person seeking consideration if he or she had to leave Canada . . . Self-sufficiency is a factor which must be considered, but it is not the overriding factor.",
    "[18]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 159 (QL), I found that the test for determining whether there are humanitarian and compassionate grounds is whether there exists a special situation in the person's home country and whether undue hardship would likely result from removal (at paragraph 15). Establishment is but one factor among others to consider in coming to a decision; it is not a determinative factor in and of itself (at paragraph 16).",
    "[19]\nThe same can be said of the applicants separation from both his father and his wife.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 119 (QL), I determined that mere separation from family members is not in itself a humanitarian and compassionate consideration justifying an exemption when there is no evidence establishing that this separation would cause unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. At paragraph 19, I wrote:\nAs Pelletier J. stated in Irimie, (IMM-427-00) at para. 12, the fact that one would be leaving behind friends, perhaps family, employment or a residence, as well as the cost or inconvenience of having to return home to apply in the normal manner would not generally be enough to constitute hardship and thus warrant a positive H & C determination. The weight to be assigned to particular factors or indicators of attachment is discretionary.",
    "[20]\nIn the absence of evidence before him that the applicants separation from his father and his wife would cause unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship, it was reasonable for the officer to determine as he did.",
    "[21]\nIn conclusion, it is important to repeat that it was only the officer, and not the Court, who had to decide the weight to be assigned to the different evidence submitted, in light of the evidence before him. In this case, the officer exercised his discretionary power reasonably. He fully examined all of the evidence submitted by the applicant in support of his HC application.",
    "[22]\nThe Supreme Court in Baker, supra, determined that the duty of procedural fairness applies to decisions involving humanitarian and compassionate grounds, including HC applications.",
    "[23]\nLe demandeur note que dans sa décision, lagent a écrit ce qui suit :\n The particular current health condition and specific care that the father needs is not clear  insufficient details.\n There are few details about who precisely the applicant employs in his company to show the economic benefit of his company.",
    "[24]\nThe applicant submitted that the officer, in making his decision, did not respect the principles of procedural fairness and that he should have given the applicant the opportunity to provide additional information. The applicant argued moreover that if the officer was of the opinion that the evidence submitted in support of his claims was not sufficiently detailed, the officer had the duty to contact the applicant and ask him for additional information.",
    "[25]\nThe applicant also noted that the Immigration Manual: (IP) Immigration Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds, chapter IP 05, states at paragraph 5.26, Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds, that immigration officers, in assessing humanitarian and compassionate considerations, must attempt to clarify possible humanitarian and compassionate grounds or public interest grounds, even if they were not well articulated and at paragraph 11.1, procedural fairness, that it is recommended that officers request any additional information needed. The applicant submitted that if the officer thought that he did not have enough details, he ought to have gotten them from the applicant and his failure to do so resulted in a breach of procedural fairness.",
    "[26]\nThe applicant referred to two decisions by Mr. Justice John OKeefe where the facts were similar.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1771 (F.C.) (QL), he was of the opinion that there was a breach of procedural fairness when the HC decision-maker failed to ask the applicant for particulars of the personalized risk he was alleging (at paragraph 27).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 431 (F.C.T.D.) (QL), he determined that since once the decision-maker decided that there was insufficient evidence to grant a landing requirement exemption and insufficient evidence to confirm whether the applicant would be able to receive and enforce support payments in Canada, he should have explored this matter further and therefore the failure to do so constituted a reviewable error (at paragraph 27).",
    "[27]\nHowever, the respondent argued that it is clear that the burden was on the applicant to file all of the relevant information in support of his HC application. At paragraph 5.1 of chapter IP 05, it states that applicants bear the onus of establishing humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Paragraph 5.26 states that the onus is on the applicants to put forth any humanitarian and compassionate factors that they feel exist in their case.",
    "[28]\nThe respondent also contended that the facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and Reis, supra, relied on by the applicant, are different from the facts of this case. Unlike  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , personalized risk is not at issue in the case at bar. In that matter, the Court determined that there was a breach of the duty of procedural fairness because the officer had failed to obtain particulars from the applicant regarding the personalized risk, while the IP5 Guidelines expressly provide that a decision-maker is bound to request particulars when the applicant has not provided details regarding the alleged risk. Moreover, the officer had not deferred the matter to another PRRA officer for risk assessment when he should have done so. In Reis, supra, it was a matter of the interest of a Canadian child, and the Court determined that the Court should have carried out a more in-depth assessment regarding the aspect of the child support.",
    "[29]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) (QL), the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that the applicant has the burden of establishing that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to justify an exemption from the normal immigration procedure (at paragraphs 18 and 23).",
    "[30]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that the applicant has the burden of submitting all of the facts in support of the HC application. At paragraph 8, the Court wrote:\nH & C applicants have no right or legitimate expectation that they will be interviewed.\nAnd, since applicants have the onus of establishing the facts on which their claim rests, they omit pertinent information from their written submissions at their peril.\nIn our view, Mr. Owusu's H & C application did not adequately raise the impact of his potential deportation on the best interests of his children so as to require the officer to consider them. [Emphasis added.]",
    "[31]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 281 (F.C.) (QL), Madam Justice Mactavish relied on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in dismissing the applicants argument that, as in this case, the officer had the obligation to contact him to obtain all of the information necessary to make an appropriate decision. At paragraphs 7, 8 and 13, she wrote: [7] While acknowledging that the immigration officer was provided with very limited submissions in support of his H & C application, Mr. Nguyen says that the officer nevertheless had an obligation to contact him in order to obtain enough information for the officer to make a proper decision. [8] In my view, this submission is squarely addressed by Owusu: the onus is on the applicant to put whatever facts that they wish to have considered before the immigration officer. It is not up to the immigration officer to seek out additional information from an applicant.\n. . . [13] For the same reasons articulated earlier in these reasons, I do not accept Mr. Nguyen's submission that there was any duty on the part of the immigration officer to seek out additional information with respect to the nature and extent of the relationship between Mr. Nguyen and his wife's child. It was up to Mr. Nguyen to put whatever information he wanted to have considered before the officer.",
    "[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1717 (F.C.) (QL), I pointed out that when an applicants argument is insufficient, as it was in this case, this does not shift the onus to the officer to obtain additional information. Paragraphs 20 to 25 read as follows: [20] I now turn to the final issue in this case, that is the applicant's allegation that the Immigration Officer's decision was not fair and breached natural justice, as she based her decision on a lack of information that she did not request from the applicant. [21] As mentioned, the Immigration Officer requested the applicant provide updated information, and specifically asked for a written explanation of who the applicant was living with prior to arriving in Canada. In reply, the applicant submits that the Immigration Officer clearly had questions about other matters, to which she did not request clarification from the applicant. Specifically, regarding whether both the applicant's son and wife were currently employed, and what the applicant's age had to do with the hardship she claimed she would face if she returned to Nicaragua. [22] The respondent submits that the onus is on the applicant to provide the decision maker with all of the pertinent information in an application. The fact that the applicant did not explain what her age had to do with her application, and that her daughter-in-law's employment status was unclear, did not place a burden on the Immigration Officer to contact the applicant in order to obtain this information. [23] I cannot agree with the position of the applicant. As was stated by Heald D.J. in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.C.):\nThe applicant submits that he is entitled to have all relevant evidence considered on a humanitarian and compassionate application. I agree with that submission. However, the onus in this respect lies with the applicant. It is his responsibility to bring to the visa officer's attention any evidence relevant to humanitarian and compassionate considerations. [24] The onus of providing all relevant evidence considered on an H & C application clearly lies with the applicant, in accordance with section 5.25 of the Manual and the statement by Heald D.J. in the Patel case. I agree with the respondent's suggestion that an insufficient submission on the part of an applicant does not result in an onus on an immigration officer to elicit further information. [25] In this case, the applicant was given the opportunity to provide information about her situation in support of her application, and the Immigration Officer even asked the applicant to provide further information. Thus, I cannot conclude that the Immigration Officer erred in not making a second request for additional information from the applicant",
    "[33]\nIn light of the above-mentioned case law, it is my opinion that it was unequivocal that the officer had no obligation to contact the applicant so that he could complete his evidence. The applicant had ample opportunity to submit all of the evidence that he deemed necessary to support of his application right up until the time that the application on humanitarian and compassionate considerations was decided. The immigration officers file notes indicate that the applicant filed submissions on May 12, 2003, as well as on June 3, 2005. He therefore had the opportunity to file all of the evidence necessary that he deemed relevant and useful in order to establish the existence of humanitarian and compassionate considerations in his case.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[34]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for judicial review of the negative finding by an immigration officer on the applicants visa exemption application based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations (HC application) dated December 8, 2005."

Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n[1]\nLe juge Rouleau\n: Il sagit dune demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision négative dun agent dimmigration à lencontre de la demande de dispense dun visa fondée sur des considérations humanitaires (demande CH) du demandeur datée du 8 décembre 2005.\n[2]\nLe demandeur est citoyen de la Russie âgé de 26 ans. Il a quitté la Russie le 24 août 1999 et est allé étudier aux États-Unis jusquau 9 décembre 2001.\n[3]\nIl est arrivé au Canada le 29 décembre 2001 et a fait une demande dasile. Cette demande a été refusée le 8 juillet 2002 par la Section de protection des réfugiés. La demande dévaluation de risques avant renvoi présentée par le demandeur le 12 décembre 2003 a été refusée le 15 avril 2004.\n[4]\nLe 12 mai 2003, le demandeur a déposé une demande fondée sur des considérations humanitaires (demande CH) au motif que son père était malade et quil devait en prendre soin, que son père et son épouse étaient au Canada et quil était propriétaire dune compagnie de construction qui employait plusieurs Canadiens.\n[5]\nLe 8 décembre 2005, la demande CH du demandeur a été refusée.\n[6]\nLagent a conclu que les informations présentées à lappui de la demande CH nont pas permis de démontrer que le demandeur rencontrerait des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives en déposant sa demande de résidence permanente de la manière habituelle, soit à lextérieur du Canada.\n[7]\nLe défendeur soulève une question préliminaire en ce qui concerne la preuve fournie par le demandeur à lappui de sa demande de contrôle judiciaire. Il est très bien établi par la jurisprudence que le contrôle judicaire dune décision doit uniquement être fondé sur la preuve dont disposait le décideur :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] A.C.F. no 52 au paragraphe 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1er. inst.). Or, les pièces D-1, D-2, D-3, D-6, D-7 et D-8 soumises à lappui de laffidavit du demandeur portent des dates postérieures à la décision rendue par lagent relativement à la demande CH. Cette nouvelle preuve dont lagent na pas été saisi ne devrait pas être considérée par cette Cour.\n[8]\nLe demandeur demande lannulation de cette décision au deux motifs : premièrement, que lagent a rendu la décision fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont il dispose, en décidant que son départ du Canada ne lui occasionnerait pas un préjudice indu ainsi quà sa famille et, deuxièmement, que lagent na pas respecté les exigences de léquité procédurale en rejetant la demande de dispense du demandeur alors que lagent admet navoir pas suffisamment de preuve devant lui pour déterminer létat de santé de son père ou limportance de son entreprise de construction.\n[9]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu que la norme de contrôle à légard des décisions CH est celle de la décision raisonnable simpliciter. Une décision déraisonnable est une  décision qui, dans lensemble, nest étayée par aucun motif capable de résister à un examen assez poussé  :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  à la page 776.\n[10]\nQuant à la deuxième question en litige, la Cour suprême du Canada a indiqué que lorsquil sagit dune question déquité procédurale, la norme de contrôle ne sapplique pas : Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aux paragraphes 100 à 103.\n[11]\nLe demandeur soutient que la décision de lagent nest pas raisonnable parce que :\n lagent aurait dû inférer de la nature même des liens existant normalement entre un individu et son père ou son épouse quun préjudice résultait dune telle séparation;\n le fait dêtre séparé de son père mourant et de son épouse est une considération dordre humanitaire justifiant loctroi dune dispense de demande de visa;\n lagent étant satisfait que son père fût malade et quil était bien intégré à la société canadienne, il devait conclure à lexistence de considérations humanitaires.\n[12]\nJe suis daccord avec le défendeur que les prétentions du demandeur ne sont que lexpression dun désaccord avec lappréciation des divers éléments de preuve dont lagent disposait pour rendre sa décision. Il nest pas le rôle de la Cour de substituer à la décision dun agent une nouvelle pondération de ces éléments.\n[13]\nLagent a exprimé lavis que la preuve présentée par le demandeur navait pas démontré en quoi la présentation de sa demande de résidence permanente, à lextérieur du Canada, causerait des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives. Concernant les représentations faites par le demandeur au sujet de son père malade, lagent a écrit ce qui suit :\nRepresentations indicate that the father is sick and needs care and that the applicant came to Canada to aid his sick father. The applicant indicates that his father will face certain death if returned to the Russian Federation because the father would not be able to find adequate treatment. The particular current health condition and specific care that the father needs is not clear  insufficient details. The possibility that the father may be removed from Canada and may not be able to find adequate health treatment in Russia is beyond the scope of the current H and C request of the applicant. (Notes au dossier de lagent, page 5)\n[14]\nBien que le demandeur allègue maintenant que son père est mourant, aucune preuve dans le dossier ne démontre quil aurait soumis de la preuve à lappui de sa demande CH confirmant et étayant cette allégation. En lespèce, je suis daccord avec le défendeur que le demandeur ne peut valablement reprocher à lagent de ne pas avoir considéré la maladie de son père comme étant une difficulté inhabituelle et injustifiée ou excessive alors quil a faut défaut de soumettre de la preuve suffisante au soutien de sa prétention.\n[15]\nConcernant le niveau détablissement du demandeur au Canada, lagent a conclu :\nIndications cited for showing his establishment are that he owns his own construction business that he says employs many Canadians and that he works full-time. There are few details about who precisely the applicant employs in his company to show the economic benefit of his company.\nThe applicant has been in Canada for nearly four years. The applicant has advanced greatly in adapting to Canadian society, working and becoming economically self-sufficient. However, his departure from Canada would not appear to create a disproportionate hardship for him or anyone else. Although the applicant has close family in Canada it is uncertain what long-term Immigration status they might obtain to remain permanently in Canada. The applicant has not adequately shown the nature and substance of his relationship with his wife or his father in such a way that a separation between himself and his wife or between the applicant and his father would cause an excessive or undue hardship if the applicant were required to depart Canada.\nThe information presented has not sufficiently shown that the applicants absence from Canada would cause an unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship for him, his family or persons in Canada. (Notes au dossier de lagent, page 6)\n[16]\nMalheureusement pour le demandeur, le fait que lagent a conclu quil avait progressé considérablement dans son adaptation au sein de la société canadienne et le fait quil travaillait et quil était devenu autonome financièrement, ne pouvaient en soi permettre à lagent de conclure à la présence de motifs dordre humanitaire.\n[17]\nDans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1er. inst.), cette Cour disait  que bien que les directives relatives aux motifs d'ordre humanitaire ne soient pas obligatoires, elles disent toutefois clairement que l'autonomie seule ne garantit pas qu'une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire serait accueillie (au para. 20).  Il doit y avoir dautres facteurs permettant une telle détermination, le facteur clé étant de savoir si  des difficultés inhabituelles, injustes ou indues seraient causées à la personne sollicitant l'examen de son cas si celle-ci devait quitter le Canada.  Lautonomie est un facteur dont il faut tenir compte, mais il ne sagit pas du facteur primordial.\n[18]\nDans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 159 (QL), jai conclu que le test à savoir sil existe des considérations humanitaires est s'il existe une situation particulière dans le pays d'origine de la personne et si un renvoi peut causer des difficultés indues (au paragraphe 15).  L'établissement n'est qu'un facteur parmi d'autres dont il faut tenir compte pour prendre une décision. Ce n'est pas un facteur déterminant à lui seul (au paragraphes 6) .\n[19]\nIl en est de même de la séparation du demandeur davec son père et son épouse. Dans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] A.C.F. no 119 (QL), jai conclu que la seule séparation en soi de membres de la famille nest pas un motif dordre humanitaire justifiant une dispense en labsence de preuve permettant de conclure que cette séparation entraînerait des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives. Au paragraphe 19, jécrivais :\nAinsi que le juge Pelletier l'a déclaré dans le jugement Irimie, (IMM-427-00) au paragraphe 12, le fait qu'une personne quitte des amis, et peut-être des membres de la famille, un emploi ou une résidence, de même que les coûts ou les inconvénients que comporterait le fait de devoir retourner dans son pays d'origine de la manière habituelle ne suffit pas nécessairement pour constituer un préjudice et pour justifier une décision favorable au sujet des raisons humanitaires. Le poids à accorder à des facteurs ou à des indices d'attachement déterminés relève du pouvoir discrétionnaire du fonctionnaire compétent.\n[20]\nEn labsence de preuve, devant lui, que la séparation du demandeur davec son père et son épouse causerait des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives, il était raisonnable pour lagent de conclure comme il la fait.\n[21]\nPour en conclure, il est important de répéter quil revenait entièrement à lagent et non pas à la Cour de décider du poids à accorder aux différents éléments soumis, à la lumière de la preuve dont il disposait. En lespèce, lagent a exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire raisonnablement. Il a fait un examen complet de tous les éléments de preuve soumis par le demandeur à lappui de sa demande CH.\n[22]\nLa Cour suprême dans Baker, ci-dessus, a conclu que lobligation déquité procédurale sapplique aux décisions touchant des motifs dordre humanitaire y compris des demandes CH.\n[23]\nLe demandeur note que dans sa décision, lagent a écrit ce qui suit :\n The particular current health condition and specific care that the father needs is not clear  insufficient details.\n There are few details about who precisely the applicant employs in his company to show the economic benefit of his company.\n[24]\nLe demandeur soutient que lagent, en rendant sa décision, na pas respecté les principes de léquité procédurale et quil aurait dû donner loccasion au demandeur de fournir des détails supplémentaires. Le demandeur soutient dailleurs que si lagent était davis que la preuve présentée au soutient de ses prétentions nétait pas suffisamment détaillée, lagent avait le devoir de communiquer avec le demandeur et lui demander des renseignements additionnels.\n[25]\nLe demandeur note également que le Guide de limmigration : (IP) Traitement des demandes au Canada, chapitre IP 05, indique, au paragraphe 5.26,  Demande présentée par des immigrants au Canada pour des motifs dordre humanitaire , que les agents dimmigration, dans leur évaluation des considérations dordre humanitaire, doivent essayer dobtenir des précisions relativement à des raisons possibles dintérêt public ou dordre humanitaire, même si celles-ci ne sont pas clairement formulées, et au paragraphe 11.1,  équité procédurale , quil est recommandé aux agents de  demander tout renseignement supplémentaire nécessaire . Le demandeur soutient que lagent étant davis quil lui manquait des détails, il devrait les obtenir du demandeur et lomission davoir fait ceci a entraîné un manquement à léquité procédurale.\n[26]\nLe demandeur cite deux décisions du juge John OKeefe comportant des faits semblables.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 1771 (C.F.) (QL), il était davis quil y eu manquement à lobligation déquité procédurale quand le décideur CH a omis dobtenir du demandeur des précisions sur le risque personnalisé quil alléguait (au paragraphe 27).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] A.C.F. no 431 (C.F. 1er. inst.) (QL), il a conclu que lorsque le décideur a estimé que la preuve ne suffisait pas à justifier une dispense dapplication de la règle relative au droit détablissement et ne permettait pas d'affirmer que la demanderesse serait en mesure de recevoir et de recouvrer une pension alimentaire au Canada, le décideur aurait dû examiner davantage ces points et donc ce manquement a constitué une erreur (au paragraphe 27).\n[27]\nToutefois, le défendeur soutient quil est clair que le fardeau reposait sur le demandeur de présenter toute linformation pertinente à lappui de sa demande CH. Au paragraphe 5.1 du chapitre IP 05, il est écrit quil incombe au demandeur de prouver les motifs dordre humanitaires. Le paragraphe 5.26 énonce quil incombe au demandeur de présenter tous les facteurs CH quil estime présents dans son cas.\n[28]\nLe défendeur soutient également que les affaires Babilly et Reis, ci-dessus, sur lesquelles se fonde le demandeur, se distinguent des faits en cause. Contrairement à laffaire Babilly, ci-dessus, il nest pas en cause dans ce dossier un risque personnalisé. Dans cette affaire, la Cour a conclu à un manquement à lobligation déquité procédurale parce que lagent avait omis dobtenir du demandeur des précisions sur le risque personnalisé, alors que les Directives IP5 prévoyaient expressément quun décideur était tenu de demandeur des précisions lorsque le demandeur navait pas fourni des détails concernant le risque allégué. Plus encore, lagent navait pas déféré laffaire à un agent ERAR pour évaluation de risque alors quil aurait dû le faire. Dans laffaire Reis, ci-dessus, il était question de lintérêt dun enfant canadien, raison pour laquelle la Cour a conclu que lagent aurait dû examiner davantage laspect de la pension alimentaire.\n[29]\nDans larrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.) (QL), la Cour dappel fédérale a réitéré quil incombe au demandeur de démontrer quil existe des considérations dordre humanitaire suffisantes pour justifier une dispense à la procédure normale dimmigration (aux paragraphes 18 et 23).\n[30]\nDans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.), la Cour dappel fédérale a réitéré que le fardeau de présenter tous les faits à lappui de la demande pour des raisons dordre humanitaire reposait sur le demandeur. Au paragraphe 8, la Cour a écrit :\nLe demandeur qui invoque des raisons d'ordre humanitaire n'a pas un droit d'être interviewé ni même une attente légitime à cet égard.\nEt, puisque le demandeur a le fardeau de présenter les faits sur lesquels sa demande repose, c'est à ses risques et périls qu'il omet des renseignements pertinents dans ses observations écrites\n. Selon nous, dans sa demande pour des raisons humanitaires, M. Owusu n'a pas suffisamment insisté sur les répercussions de son expulsion potentielle sur l'intérêt supérieur de ses enfants de manière à ce que l'agente n'ait d'autre choix que d'en tenir compte. (cest moi qui souligne)\n[31]\nDans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 281 (C.F.) (QL), la juge Mactavish sest fondée sur la décision Owusu, ci-dessus, pour rejeter largument du demandeur qui prétendait, comme en lespèce, que lagent avait lobligation de communiquer avec lui pour obtenir toute linformation nécessaire pour rendre une décision appropriée. Aux paragraphes 7, 8 et 13, elle a écrit :\n[7] Bien qu'il reconnaisse qu'il avait présenté très peu d'arguments à l'agent d'immigration au sujet de sa demande CH, M. Nguyen soutient que ce dernier avait néanmoins l'obligation de communiquer avec lui pour obtenir toute l'information nécessaire pour rendre une décision appropriée.\n[8] Selon moi, cette question est réglée par l'arrêt Owusu : c'est le demandeur qui a le fardeau de présenter à l'agent d'immigration les faits dont il veut qu'il tienne compte. L'agent d'immigration n'est pas tenu de tenter d'obtenir d'autres renseignements du demandeur.\n[. . . . .]\n[13] Pour les motifs que j'ai déjà exprimés ci-haut, je n'accepte pas l'observation de M. Nguyen selon laquelle l'agent d'immigration avait l'obligation de chercher à obtenir des renseignements additionnels quant à la nature et à l'importance du lien existant entre M. Nguyen et l'enfant de son épouse. C'est M. Nguyen qui avait l'obligation de présenter à l'agent tous les renseignements dont il voulait qu'il tienne compte.\n[32]\nDans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] A.C.F. no 1717 (C.F.) (QL), jai souligné que lorsquun demandeur soumet une prétention insuffisante, comme la fait le demandeur dans le présent dossier, cela ne transfère pas à lagent le fardeau dobtenir dautres renseignements supplémentaires. Les paragraphes 20 à 25 se lisent comme suit :\n[20] Je vais maintenant traiter de la dernière question en litige dans la présente affaire, soit la prétention de la demanderesse selon laquelle la décision de l'agente d'immigration enfreignait les règles d'équité et de justice naturelle étant donné qu'elle était fondée sur l'absence de renseignements qui ne lui avaient pas été demandés.\n[21] Comme il a été mentionné, l'agente d'immigration a demandé à la demanderesse de fournir des renseignements à jour et notamment des renseignements écrits à l'égard des personnes avec qui elle vivait avant de venir au Canada. En réponse, la demanderesse prétend que l'agente d'immigration avait clairement des questions sur d'autres points pour lesquels elle ne lui a pas demandé de clarifications. Ces points touchaient notamment la question de savoir si le fils de la demanderesse et sa belle-fille travaillaient actuellement tous deux et le lien qu'avait l'âge de la demanderesse avec les difficultés qu'elle subirait si elle retournait au Nicaragua.\n[22] Le défendeur prétend qu'il appartient au demandeur de fournir au décideur tous les renseignements pertinents lors d'une demande. L'agente d'immigration n'avait pas l'obligation de communiquer avec la demanderesse pour obtenir des renseignements à l'égard des questions qui résultaient du fait que la demanderesse n'avait pas expliqué le lien entre son âge et sa demande et du fait que la situation d'emploi de sa belle-fille n'était pas claire.\n[23] Je ne peux pas partager l'opinion de la demanderesse sur cette question. Comme M. le juge Heald a déclaré dans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F.C.) :\nLe requérant prétend avoir droit à ce qu'il soit tenu compte de toute la preuve pertinente dans le cadre de sa demande invoquant des considérations humanitaires. Je suis d'accord. Cependant, le fardeau de la preuve à cet égard incombe alors au requérant. Il a la responsabilité de porter à l'attention de l'agent des visas toute la preuve pertinente relative à des considérations humanitaires.\n[24] Le fardeau de fournir tous les éléments de preuve pertinents pris en compte dans une demande fondée sur des circonstances d'ordre humanitaire appartient clairement au demandeur selon ce que prévoit la section 5.25 du Guide et selon la déclaration du juge Heald dans la décision Patel. Je suis d'accord avec le défendeur lorsqu'il soumet qu'une prétention insuffisante par un demandeur ne transfère pas à l'agent d'immigration le fardeau d'obtenir d'autres renseignements.\n[25] Dans la présente affaire, la demanderesse a eu la possibilité de fournir au soutien de sa demande des renseignements à l'égard de sa situation et l'agente d'immigration a même demandé à la demanderesse de fournir d'autres renseignements. Par conséquent, je ne peux pas conclure que l'agente d'immigration a commis une erreur en omettant de demander à la demanderesse de fournir des renseignements additionnels.\n[33]\nÀ la lumière de la jurisprudence précitée, je suis davis quil est sans équivoque que lagent navait aucune obligation de communiquer avec le demandeur afin de lui permettre de parfaire sa preuve. Le demandeur a eu amplement loccasion de soumettre tous les éléments de preuve quil jugeait nécessaire à lappui de sa demande et ceci jusquà ce quune décision sur la demande des motifs humanitaires soit rendue. Il ressort des notes au dossier de lagent dimmigration que le demandeur a soumis des prétentions en date du 12 mai 2003 ainsi quen date du 3 juin 2005. Il a donc eu lopportunité de déposer toute la preuve nécessaire quil jugeait pertinente et utile afin de démontrer lexistence de considérations dordre humanitaire dans son cas.\nJUGEMENT\n[34]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for judicial review of the negative finding by an immigration officer on the applicants visa exemption application based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations (HC application) dated December 8, 2005.\n[2]\nThe applicant is a 26-year-old citizen of Russia. He left Russia on August 24, 1999, and went to study in the United States until December 9, 2001.\n[3]\nHe arrived in Canada on December 29, 2001, and filed a refugee claim. The Refugee Protection Division denied this claim on July 8, 2002. The pre-removal risk assessment filed by the applicant on December 12, 2003, was refused on April 15, 2004.\n[4]\nOn May 12, 2003, the applicant filed an application based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations (HC application) on the grounds that his father was sick and that he had to take care of him, that his father and his wife were in Canada and that he owned a construction company that employed several Canadians.\n[5]\nOn December 8, 2005, the applicants HC application was refused.\n[6]\nThe officer determined that the information filed in support of the HC application did not establish that the applicant would encounter unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship by filing his permanent residence application in the usual fashion, i.e. from outside Canada.\n[7]\nThe respondent raised a preliminary question regarding the evidence submitted by the applicant in support of his application for judicial review. It is well settled in the case law that the judicial review of a decision must be based only on the evidence before the decision-maker:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 52 at paragraph 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). Yet, exhibits D-1, D-2, D-3, D-6, D-7 and D-8 submitted in support of the applicants affidavit are dated after the officers decision on the HC application. This Court cannot consider this new evidence that was not before the officer.\n[8]\nThe applicant is seeking to have this decision set aside on two grounds: first, the officers decision was based on an erroneous finding of fact, made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before him, in finding that his departure from Canada would not cause him or his family undue hardship and, second, the officer did not respect the procedural fairness requirements in refusing the applicants exemption application, when the officer admitted that he did not have enough evidence before him to determine the state of his fathers health or the size of his construction business.\n[9]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada determined that the standard of review for HC decisions is that of reasonableness simpliciter. An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraphs 100 to 103.\n[11]\nThe applicant submitted that the officers decision is not reasonable because:\n the officer should have inferred from the very nature of the ties existing between an individual and his father or his wife that hardship would be caused by such a separation;\n the fact of being separated from his dying father and his wife is a humanitarian and compassionate consideration which justifies granting a visa exemption application;\n the officer was satisfied that his father was sick and that he was well integrated in Canadian society, he ought to have found that there were humanitarian and compassionate considerations.\n[12]\nI agree with the respondent that the applicants arguments are no more than an expression of his disagreement with the assessment of various pieces of evidence the officer had before him in making his decision. It is not the role of this Court to substitute a new assessment of this evidence for the officers decision.\n[13]\nThe officer expressed the opinion that the evidence filed by the applicant did not establish how it would cause him unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he were to file his permanent residence application from outside Canada. With respect to the submissions made by the applicant regarding his sick father, the officer wrote the following:\nRepresentations indicate that the father is sick and needs care and that the applicant came to Canada to aid his sick father. The applicant indicates that his father will face certain death if returned to the Russian Federation because the father would not be able to find adequate treatment. The particular current health condition and specific care that the father needs is not clear  insufficient details. The possibility that the father may be removed from Canada and may not be able to find adequate health treatment in Russia is beyond the scope of the current H and C request of the applicant.\n(Officers file notes, page 5)\n[14]\nAlthough the applicant is now alleging that his father is dying, there is no evidence in the record establishing that he submitted supporting evidence in his HC application confirming and substantiating this allegation. In this case, I agree with the respondent that the applicant cannot validly allege that the officer did not consider his fathers illness as an unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship when he failed to submit evidence in support of his claim.\n[15]\nWith respect to the applicants establishment in Canada, the officer determined:\nIndications cited for showing his establishment are that he owns his own construction business that he says employs many Canadians and that he works full-time. There are few details about who precisely the applicant employs in his company to show the economic benefit of his company.\nThe applicant has been in Canada for nearly four years. The applicant has advanced greatly in adapting to Canadian society, working and becoming economically self-sufficient. However, his departure from Canada would not appear to create a disproportionate hardship for him or anyone else. Although the applicant has close family in Canada it is uncertain what long-term Immigration status they might obtain to remain permanently in Canada. The applicant has not adequately shown the nature and substance of his relationship with his wife or his father in such a way that a separation between himself and his wife or between the applicant and his father would cause an excessive or undue hardship if the applicant were required to depart Canada.\nThe information presented has not sufficiently shown that the applicants absence from Canada would cause an unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship for him, his family or persons in Canada.\n(Officers file notes, page 6)\n[16]\nUnfortunately for the applicant, even though the officer determined that he had made considerable progress adapting to Canadian society and that he was working and had become financially self-sufficient, those factors alone were not enough for the officer to determine that there were humanitarian and compassionate grounds.\n[17]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), this Court stated that . . . although the Guidelines with respect to Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds are not binding, they nevertheless clearly indicate that self-sufficiency does not, in itself, guarantee or lead to a positive outcome in a humanitarian and compassionate grounds application . . .(at paragraph 20). There must be other factors supporting such a finding, the pivotal factor being whether . . . unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be caused to the person seeking consideration if he or she had to leave Canada . . . Self-sufficiency is a factor which must be considered, but it is not the overriding factor.\n[18]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 159 (QL), I found that the test for determining whether there are humanitarian and compassionate grounds is whether there exists a special situation in the person's home country and whether undue hardship would likely result from removal (at paragraph 15). Establishment is but one factor among others to consider in coming to a decision; it is not a determinative factor in and of itself (at paragraph 16).\n[19]\nThe same can be said of the applicants separation from both his father and his wife.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 119 (QL), I determined that mere separation from family members is not in itself a humanitarian and compassionate consideration justifying an exemption when there is no evidence establishing that this separation would cause unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. At paragraph 19, I wrote:\nAs Pelletier J. stated in Irimie, (IMM-427-00) at para. 12, the fact that one would be leaving behind friends, perhaps family, employment or a residence, as well as the cost or inconvenience of having to return home to apply in the normal manner would not generally be enough to constitute hardship and thus warrant a positive H & C determination. The weight to be assigned to particular factors or indicators of attachment is discretionary.\n[20]\nIn the absence of evidence before him that the applicants separation from his father and his wife would cause unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship, it was reasonable for the officer to determine as he did.\n[21]\nIn conclusion, it is important to repeat that it was only the officer, and not the Court, who had to decide the weight to be assigned to the different evidence submitted, in light of the evidence before him. In this case, the officer exercised his discretionary power reasonably. He fully examined all of the evidence submitted by the applicant in support of his HC application.\n[22]\nThe Supreme Court in Baker, supra, determined that the duty of procedural fairness applies to decisions involving humanitarian and compassionate grounds, including HC applications.\n[23]\nThe applicant noted that in his decision, the officer wrote the following:\n The particular current health condition and specific care that the father needs is not clear  insufficient details.\n There are few details about who precisely the applicant employs in his company to show the economic benefit of his company.\n[24]\nThe applicant submitted that the officer, in making his decision, did not respect the principles of procedural fairness and that he should have given the applicant the opportunity to provide additional information. The applicant argued moreover that if the officer was of the opinion that the evidence submitted in support of his claims was not sufficiently detailed, the officer had the duty to contact the applicant and ask him for additional information.\n[25]\nThe applicant also noted that the Immigration Manual: (IP) Immigration Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds, chapter IP 05, states at paragraph 5.26, Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds, that immigration officers, in assessing humanitarian and compassionate considerations, must attempt to clarify possible humanitarian and compassionate grounds or public interest grounds, even if they were not well articulated and at paragraph 11.1, procedural fairness, that it is recommended that officers request any additional information needed. The applicant submitted that if the officer thought that he did not have enough details, he ought to have gotten them from the applicant and his failure to do so resulted in a breach of procedural fairness.\n[26]\nThe applicant referred to two decisions by Mr. Justice John OKeefe where the facts were similar.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1771 (F.C.) (QL), he was of the opinion that there was a breach of procedural fairness when the HC decision-maker failed to ask the applicant for particulars of the personalized risk he was alleging (at paragraph 27).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 431 (F.C.T.D.) (QL), he determined that since once the decision-maker decided that there was insufficient evidence to grant a landing requirement exemption and insufficient evidence to confirm whether the applicant would be able to receive and enforce support payments in Canada, he should have explored this matter further and therefore the failure to do so constituted a reviewable error (at paragraph 27).\n[27]\nHowever, the respondent argued that it is clear that the burden was on the applicant to file all of the relevant information in support of his HC application. At paragraph 5.1 of chapter IP 05, it states that applicants bear the onus of establishing humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Paragraph 5.26 states that the onus is on the applicants to put forth any humanitarian and compassionate factors that they feel exist in their case.\n[28]\nThe respondent also contended that the facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and Reis, supra, relied on by the applicant, are different from the facts of this case. Unlike  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , personalized risk is not at issue in the case at bar. In that matter, the Court determined that there was a breach of the duty of procedural fairness because the officer had failed to obtain particulars from the applicant regarding the personalized risk, while the IP5 Guidelines expressly provide that a decision-maker is bound to request particulars when the applicant has not provided details regarding the alleged risk. Moreover, the officer had not deferred the matter to another PRRA officer for risk assessment when he should have done so. In Reis, supra, it was a matter of the interest of a Canadian child, and the Court determined that the Court should have carried out a more in-depth assessment regarding the aspect of the child support.\n[29]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) (QL), the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that the applicant has the burden of establishing that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to justify an exemption from the normal immigration procedure (at paragraphs 18 and 23).\n[30]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that the applicant has the burden of submitting all of the facts in support of the HC application. At paragraph 8, the Court wrote:\nH & C applicants have no right or legitimate expectation that they will be interviewed.\nAnd, since applicants have the onus of establishing the facts on which their claim rests, they omit pertinent information from their written submissions at their peril.\nIn our view, Mr. Owusu's H & C application did not adequately raise the impact of his potential deportation on the best interests of his children so as to require the officer to consider them. [Emphasis added.]\n[31]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 281 (F.C.) (QL), Madam Justice Mactavish relied on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in dismissing the applicants argument that, as in this case, the officer had the obligation to contact him to obtain all of the information necessary to make an appropriate decision. At paragraphs 7, 8 and 13, she wrote:\n[7] While acknowledging that the immigration officer was provided with very limited submissions in support of his H & C application, Mr. Nguyen says that the officer nevertheless had an obligation to contact him in order to obtain enough information for the officer to make a proper decision.\n[8] In my view, this submission is squarely addressed by Owusu: the onus is on the applicant to put whatever facts that they wish to have considered before the immigration officer. It is not up to the immigration officer to seek out additional information from an applicant.\n. . .\n[13] For the same reasons articulated earlier in these reasons, I do not accept Mr. Nguyen's submission that there was any duty on the part of the immigration officer to seek out additional information with respect to the nature and extent of the relationship between Mr. Nguyen and his wife's child. It was up to Mr. Nguyen to put whatever information he wanted to have considered before the officer.\n[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1717 (F.C.) (QL), I pointed out that when an applicants argument is insufficient, as it was in this case, this does not shift the onus to the officer to obtain additional information. Paragraphs 20 to 25 read as follows:\n[20] I now turn to the final issue in this case, that is the applicant's allegation that the Immigration Officer's decision was not fair and breached natural justice, as she based her decision on a lack of information that she did not request from the applicant.\n[21] As mentioned, the Immigration Officer requested the applicant provide updated information, and specifically asked for a written explanation of who the applicant was living with prior to arriving in Canada. In reply, the applicant submits that the Immigration Officer clearly had questions about other matters, to which she did not request clarification from the applicant. Specifically, regarding whether both the applicant's son and wife were currently employed, and what the applicant's age had to do with the hardship she claimed she would face if she returned to Nicaragua.\n[22] The respondent submits that the onus is on the applicant to provide the decision maker with all of the pertinent information in an application. The fact that the applicant did not explain what her age had to do with her application, and that her daughter-in-law's employment status was unclear, did not place a burden on the Immigration Officer to contact the applicant in order to obtain this information.\n[23] I cannot agree with the position of the applicant. As was stated by Heald D.J. in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.C.):\nThe applicant submits that he is entitled to have all relevant evidence considered on a humanitarian and compassionate application. I agree with that submission. However, the onus in this respect lies with the applicant. It is his responsibility to bring to the visa officer's attention any evidence relevant to humanitarian and compassionate considerations.\n[24] The onus of providing all relevant evidence considered on an H & C application clearly lies with the applicant, in accordance with section 5.25 of the Manual and the statement by Heald D.J. in the Patel case. I agree with the respondent's suggestion that an insufficient submission on the part of an applicant does not result in an onus on an immigration officer to elicit further information.\n[25] In this case, the applicant was given the opportunity to provide information about her situation in support of her application, and the Immigration Officer even asked the applicant to provide further information. Thus, I cannot conclude that the Immigration Officer erred in not making a second request for additional information from the applicant\n[33]\nIn light of the above-mentioned case law, it is my opinion that it was unequivocal that the officer had no obligation to contact the applicant so that he could complete his evidence. The applicant had ample opportunity to submit all of the evidence that he deemed necessary to support of his application right up until the time that the application on humanitarian and compassionate considerations was decided. The immigration officers file notes indicate that the applicant filed submissions on May 12, 2003, as well as on June 3, 2005. He therefore had the opportunity to file all of the evidence necessary that he deemed relevant and useful in order to establish the existence of humanitarian and compassionate considerations in his case.\nJUDGMENT\n[34]\nThe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n[End of document]",

He left Russia on August 24, 1999, and went to study in the United States until December 9, 2001.\n\n[3]\nHe arrived in Canada on December 29, 2001, and filed a refugee claim. The Refugee Protection Division denied this claim on July 8, 2002. The pre-removal risk assessment filed by the applicant on December 12, 2003, was refused on April 15, 2004.\n\n[4]\nOn May 12, 2003, the applicant filed an application based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations (HC application) on the grounds that his father was sick and that he had to take care of him, that his father and his wife were in Canada and that he owned a construction company that employed several Canadians.\n\n[5]\nOn December 8, 2005, the applicants HC application was refused.\n\n[6]\nThe officer determined that the information filed in support of the HC application did not establish that the applicant would encounter unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship by filing his permanent residence application in the usual fashion, i.e. from outside Canada.\n\n[7]\nThe respondent raised a preliminary question regarding the evidence submitted by the applicant in support of his application for judicial review. It is well settled in the case law that the judicial review of a decision must be based only on the evidence before the decision-maker:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 52 at paragraph 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). Yet, exhibits D-1, D-2, D-3, D-6, D-7 and D-8 submitted in support of the applicants affidavit are dated after the officers decision on the HC application. This Court cannot consider this new evidence that was not before the officer.\n\n[8]\nThe applicant is seeking to have this decision set aside on two grounds: first, the officers decision was based on an erroneous finding of fact, made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before him, in finding that his departure from Canada would not cause him or his family undue hardship and, second, the officer did not respect the procedural fairness requirements in refusing the applicants exemption application, when the officer admitted that he did not have enough evidence before him to determine the state of his fathers health or the size of his construction business.\n\n[9]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada determined that the standard of review for HC decisions is that of reasonableness simpliciter. An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraphs 100 to 103.\n\n[10]\nAs to the second issue in dispute, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that when it comes to a question of procedural fairness, the standard of review does not apply: Canadian Union of Public Employees ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 100 to 103.\n\n[11]\nThe applicant submitted that the officers decision is not reasonable because:\n the officer should have inferred from the very nature of the ties existing between an individual and his father or his wife that hardship would be caused by such a separation;\n the fact of being separated from his dying father and his wife is a humanitarian and compassionate consideration which justifies granting a visa exemption application;\n the officer was satisfied that his father was sick and that he was well integrated in Canadian society, he ought to have found that there were humanitarian and compassionate considerations.\n\n[12]\nI agree with the respondent that the applicants arguments are no more than an expression of his disagreement with the assessment of various pieces of evidence the officer had before him in making his decision.

With respect to the submissions made by the applicant regarding his sick father, the officer wrote the following:\nRepresentations indicate that the father is sick and needs care and that the applicant came to Canada to aid his sick father. The applicant indicates that his father will face certain death if returned to the Russian Federation because the father would not be able to find adequate treatment. The particular current health condition and specific care that the father needs is not clear  insufficient details. The possibility that the father may be removed from Canada and may not be able to find adequate health treatment in Russia is beyond the scope of the current H and C request of the applicant.\n(Officers file notes, page 5)\n\n[14]\nAlthough the applicant is now alleging that his father is dying, there is no evidence in the record establishing that he submitted supporting evidence in his HC application confirming and substantiating this allegation. In this case, I agree with the respondent that the applicant cannot validly allege that the officer did not consider his fathers illness as an unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship when he failed to submit evidence in support of his claim.\n\n[15]\nConcernant le niveau détablissement du demandeur au Canada, lagent a conclu :\nIndications cited for showing his establishment are that he owns his own construction business that he says employs many Canadians and that he works full-time. There are few details about who precisely the applicant employs in his company to show the economic benefit of his company.\nThe applicant has been in Canada for nearly four years. The applicant has advanced greatly in adapting to Canadian society, working and becoming economically self-sufficient. However, his departure from Canada would not appear to create a disproportionate hardship for him or anyone else. Although the applicant has close family in Canada it is uncertain what long-term Immigration status they might obtain to remain permanently in Canada. The applicant has not adequately shown the nature and substance of his relationship with his wife or his father in such a way that a separation between himself and his wife or between the applicant and his father would cause an excessive or undue hardship if the applicant were required to depart Canada.\nThe information presented has not sufficiently shown that the applicants absence from Canada would cause an unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship for him, his family or persons in Canada. (Notes au dossier de lagent, page 6)\n\n[16]\nUnfortunately for the applicant, even though the officer determined that he had made considerable progress adapting to Canadian society and that he was working and had become financially self-sufficient, those factors alone were not enough for the officer to determine that there were humanitarian and compassionate grounds.\n\n[17]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), this Court stated that . . . although the Guidelines with respect to Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds are not binding, they nevertheless clearly indicate that self-sufficiency does not, in itself, guarantee or lead to a positive outcome in a humanitarian and compassionate grounds application . . .(at paragraph 20). There must be other factors supporting such a finding, the pivotal factor being whether . . . unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be caused to the person seeking consideration if he or she had to leave Canada . . . Self-sufficiency is a factor which must be considered, but it is not the overriding factor.\n\n[18]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 159 (QL), I found that the test for determining whether there are humanitarian and compassionate grounds is whether there exists a special situation in the person's home country and whether undue hardship would likely result from removal (at paragraph 15). Establishment is but one factor among others to consider in coming to a decision; it is not a determinative factor in and of itself (at paragraph 16).\n\n[19]\nThe same can be said of the applicants separation from both his father and his wife.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 119 (QL), I determined that mere separation from family members is not in itself a humanitarian and compassionate consideration justifying an exemption when there is no evidence establishing that this separation would cause unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. At paragraph 19, I wrote:\nAs Pelletier J. stated in Irimie, (IMM-427-00) at para. 12, the fact that one would be leaving behind friends, perhaps family, employment or a residence, as well as the cost or inconvenience of having to return home to apply in the normal manner would not generally be enough to constitute hardship and thus warrant a positive H & C determination. The weight to be assigned to particular factors or indicators of attachment is discretionary.\n\n[20]\nIn the absence of evidence before him that the applicants separation from his father and his wife would cause unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship, it was reasonable for the officer to determine as he did.\n\n[21]\nIn conclusion, it is important to repeat that it was only the officer, and not the Court, who had to decide the weight to be assigned to the different evidence submitted, in light of the evidence before him. In this case, the officer exercised his discretionary power reasonably. He fully examined all of the evidence submitted by the applicant in support of his HC application.\n\n[22]\nThe Supreme Court in Baker, supra, determined that the duty of procedural fairness applies to decisions involving humanitarian and compassionate grounds, including HC applications.\n\n[23]\nLe demandeur note que dans sa décision, lagent a écrit ce qui suit :\n The particular current health condition and specific care that the father needs is not clear  insufficient details.\n There are few details about who precisely the applicant employs in his company to show the economic benefit of his company.\n\n[24]\nThe applicant submitted that the officer, in making his decision, did not respect the principles of procedural fairness and that he should have given the applicant the opportunity to provide additional information. The applicant argued moreover that if the officer was of the opinion that the evidence submitted in support of his claims was not sufficiently detailed, the officer had the duty to contact the applicant and ask him for additional information.\n\n[25]\nThe applicant also noted that the Immigration Manual: (IP) Immigration Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds, chapter IP 05, states at paragraph 5.26, Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds, that immigration officers, in assessing humanitarian and compassionate considerations, must attempt to clarify possible humanitarian and compassionate grounds or public interest grounds, even if they were not well articulated and at paragraph 11.1, procedural fairness, that it is recommended that officers request any additional information needed. The applicant submitted that if the officer thought that he did not have enough details, he ought to have gotten them from the applicant and his failure to do so resulted in a breach of procedural fairness.\n\n[26]\nThe applicant referred to two decisions by Mr. Justice John OKeefe where the facts were similar.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1771 (F.C.) (QL), he was of the opinion that there was a breach of procedural fairness when the HC decision-maker failed to ask the applicant for particulars of the personalized risk he was alleging (at paragraph 27).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 431 (F.C.T.D.) (QL), he determined that since once the decision-maker decided that there was insufficient evidence to grant a landing requirement exemption and insufficient evidence to confirm whether the applicant would be able to receive and enforce support payments in Canada, he should have explored this matter further and therefore the failure to do so constituted a reviewable error (at paragraph 27).\n\n[27]\nHowever, the respondent argued that it is clear that the burden was on the applicant to file all of the relevant information in support of his HC application. At paragraph 5.1 of chapter IP 05, it states that applicants bear the onus of establishing humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Paragraph 5.26 states that the onus is on the applicants to put forth any humanitarian and compassionate factors that they feel exist in their case.\n\n[28]\nThe respondent also contended that the facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and Reis, supra, relied on by the applicant, are different from the facts of this case. Unlike  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , personalized risk is not at issue in the case at bar. In that matter, the Court determined that there was a breach of the duty of procedural fairness because the officer had failed to obtain particulars from the applicant regarding the personalized risk, while the IP5 Guidelines expressly provide that a decision-maker is bound to request particulars when the applicant has not provided details regarding the alleged risk. Moreover, the officer had not deferred the matter to another PRRA officer for risk assessment when he should have done so. In Reis, supra, it was a matter of the interest of a Canadian child, and the Court determined that the Court should have carried out a more in-depth assessment regarding the aspect of the child support.\n\n[29]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) (QL), the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that the applicant has the burden of establishing that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to justify an exemption from the normal immigration procedure (at paragraphs 18 and 23).\n\n[30]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that the applicant has the burden of submitting all of the facts in support of the HC application. At paragraph 8, the Court wrote:\nH & C applicants have no right or legitimate expectation that they will be interviewed.\nAnd, since applicants have the onus of establishing the facts on which their claim rests, they omit pertinent information from their written submissions at their peril.\nIn our view, Mr. Owusu's H & C application did not adequately raise the impact of his potential deportation on the best interests of his children so as to require the officer to consider them. [Emphasis added.]\n\n[31]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 281 (F.C.) (QL), Madam Justice Mactavish relied on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in dismissing the applicants argument that, as in this case, the officer had the obligation to contact him to obtain all of the information necessary to make an appropriate decision. At paragraphs 7, 8 and 13, she wrote: [7] While acknowledging that the immigration officer was provided with very limited submissions in support of his H & C application, Mr. Nguyen says that the officer nevertheless had an obligation to contact him in order to obtain enough information for the officer to make a proper decision. [8] In my view, this submission is squarely addressed by Owusu: the onus is on the applicant to put whatever facts that they wish to have considered before the immigration officer. It is not up to the immigration officer to seek out additional information from an applicant.\n. . . [13] For the same reasons articulated earlier in these reasons, I do not accept Mr. Nguyen's submission that there was any duty on the part of the immigration officer to seek out additional information with respect to the nature and extent of the relationship between Mr. Nguyen and his wife's child. It was up to Mr. Nguyen to put whatever information he wanted to have considered before the officer.\n\n[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1717 (F.C.) (QL), I pointed out that when an applicants argument is insufficient, as it was in this case, this does not shift the onus to the officer to obtain additional information. Paragraphs 20 to 25 read as follows: [20] I now turn to the final issue in this case, that is the applicant's allegation that the Immigration Officer's decision was not fair and breached natural justice, as she based her decision on a lack of information that she did not request from the applicant. [21] As mentioned, the Immigration Officer requested the applicant provide updated information, and specifically asked for a written explanation of who the applicant was living with prior to arriving in Canada. In reply, the applicant submits that the Immigration Officer clearly had questions about other matters, to which she did not request clarification from the applicant. Specifically, regarding whether both the applicant's son and wife were currently employed, and what the applicant's age had to do with the hardship she claimed she would face if she returned to Nicaragua. [22] The respondent submits that the onus is on the applicant to provide the decision maker with all of the pertinent information in an application. The fact that the applicant did not explain what her age had to do with her application, and that her daughter-in-law's employment status was unclear, did not place a burden on the Immigration Officer to contact the applicant in order to obtain this information. [23] I cannot agree with the position of the applicant. As was stated by Heald D.J. in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.C.):\nThe applicant submits that he is entitled to have all relevant evidence considered on a humanitarian and compassionate application. I agree with that submission. However, the onus in this respect lies with the applicant. It is his responsibility to bring to the visa officer's attention any evidence relevant to humanitarian and compassionate considerations. [24] The onus of providing all relevant evidence considered on an H & C application clearly lies with the applicant, in accordance with section 5.25 of the Manual and the statement by Heald D.J. in the Patel case. I agree with the respondent's suggestion that an insufficient submission on the part of an applicant does not result in an onus on an immigration officer to elicit further information. [25] In this case, the applicant was given the opportunity to provide information about her situation in support of her application, and the Immigration Officer even asked the applicant to provide further information. Thus, I cannot conclude that the Immigration Officer erred in not making a second request for additional information from the applicant\n\n[33]\nIn light of the above-mentioned case law, it is my opinion that it was unequivocal that the officer had no obligation to contact the applicant so that he could complete his evidence. The applicant had ample opportunity to submit all of the evidence that he deemed necessary to support of his application right up until the time that the application on humanitarian and compassionate considerations was decided. The immigration officers file notes indicate that the applicant filed submissions on May 12, 2003, as well as on June 3, 2005. He therefore had the opportunity to file all of the evidence necessary that he deemed relevant and useful in order to establish the existence of humanitarian and compassionate considerations in his case.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[34]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for judicial review of the negative finding by an immigration officer on the applicants visa exemption application based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations (HC application) dated December 8, 2005.",
