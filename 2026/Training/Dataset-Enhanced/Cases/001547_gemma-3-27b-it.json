    "[1]\nJoyal, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review seeking to set aside the decision of the Refugee Division dated September 16, 1993, in which it concluded that the applicants were not Convention refugees.\nThe Facts",
    "[2]\nThe applicants, who are citizens of Israel, claimed refugee status on September 21, 1993, for reasons of religion, nationality, political opinion and membership in a particular social group. They based their claims on the following facts.",
    "[3]\nThe applicants, who are of Russian nationality and the Christian religion, left Tadzhikistan for Israel in February 1991. When they arrived in Israel, they experienced some difficult moments. Specifically, on May 17, 1992, the son, Andrey, was beaten up at school by some schoolmates. The parents' complaint to the police was in vain, since the officers replied that this was simply an adolescent quarrel. On August 23, 1992, some adolescents threw stones at the female applicant. In response, the police came to make a report, but did not return to do a follow-up as they said they would. On September 2, 1992, Andrey received death threats from some adolescents. This time, the applicants did not make a complaint, thinking that it would be futile to do so. In addition, the applicants were opposed to circumcision and refused to do compulsory military service, since they were convinced that they would be sent into the occupied territories and Russians were persecuted in the Israeli army.\nDecision Of The Refugee Division",
    "[4]\nThe Refugee Division concluded that the applicants had not met their burden of establishing a well-founded fear of persecution for one of the reasons advanced. On this point, the Refugee Division pointed out that there was no evidence in respect of two essential components of the refugee definition: the concept of persecution and the inability of the state to protect its citizens.",
    "[5]\nSpecifically, the Board held that the events experienced by the applicants constituted discrimination rather than persecution. For example, according to the Refugee Division, the work-related problems were not the result solely of their origins, since there is a high unemployment rate in Israel. Moreover, the documentary evidence established that 85% to 90% of Russian immigrants find employment after two years. On the issue of military service, the applicants knew that when they immigrated to Israel they would have to comply with this duty. The Board also pointed out that it is always possible to apply for an exemption for special reasons or to be given an alternative form of service.",
    "[6]\nFinally, the Refugee Division stated that the applicants had not established in a clear and convincing manner that the state was unable to protect them. According to the Board, the applicants did not persevere in their attempts to obtain protection and did not avail themselves of the assistance provided by organizations that have been formed in Israel to defend victims of discrimination.\nApplicants' Position",
    "[7]\nAccording to the applicants, discrimination is recognized in Canadian law as a distinction that has the effect of imposing obligations or disadvantages, or preventing or restricting access to opportunities, benefits or advantages offered to other members. In light of this definition, the applicants submit that the fact that they were beaten and threatened is not discrimination, but rather persecution. Thus, by putting these acts in the same category as discrimination, the Board erred in law. The applicants also point out that persecution was defined in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , as \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\". The applicants assert that this is the situation in the case at bar, in view of the violation of their right to security of the person. The applicants also point out that they do not have to prove that they were persecuted, but only that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for one of the reasons advanced.",
    "[8]\nAccording to the applicants, the Refugee Division stated the opinion in its decision that all citizens must know the laws and infrastructures of their country. The applicants were never given the opportunity to respond to this comment, as the rules of procedural fairness require. In addition, according to counsel for the applicants, the Refugee Division imposed additional requirements on the claimants and thereby created its own exclusion clauses.",
    "[9]\nOn the question of military service, the applicants submit that the type of military action that they fear is condemned by the international community as contrary to basic rules of human conduct. In addition, engaging in attacks on the civilian population may constitute a war crime in certain circumstances.\nRespondents' Position",
    "[10]\nAccording to the respondents, the courts have clearly established that discrimination does not necessarily found a fear of persecution. In addition, the respondent pointed out that the question is certainly not whether other conclusions could have been drawn from the evidence submitted, but rather whether the conclusions drawn by the Board were perverse, capricious or unreasonable. In the case at bar, the respondent contends that the conclusions of the Refugee Division are fully supported by the evidence. The fact that the applicants suggest different conclusions does not make the Refugee Division's conclusions perverse or capricious.",
    "[11]\nOn the issue of state protection, the respondent contends that the applicants have not established, by clear and convincing proof, that Israel was unable to protect them. Thus the presumption that nations are capable of protecting their citizens applies. In addition, the applicants have not established that it was objectively unreasonable for them to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities in their country. The respondent also points out that the Federal Court of Appeal has recognized, in\nMinister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 334, that the mere fact that the authorities are not always successful at protecting their citizens will not be enough to justify a claim.",
    "[12]\nThe applicants were aware that the panel would necessarily be considering the documentary evidence file. Right at the beginning of the hearing, the panel informed counsel for the applicants of this, and naturally he did not object. This means that there was compliance with the rules of fairness.",
    "[13]\nThe respondent contends that the Federal Court of Appeal has clarified the state of the law in respect of conscientious objection to military service that is mandated by an ordinary law of general application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the court held that the intent of the legislation in question must be examined, and it must be determined whether it implies persecution within the meaning of the definition. In light of this test, the respondent contends that the Israeli law does not engender persecution, since the rules are the same for everyone and they are directly related to the political situation in that region of the world. In addition, the respondent notes that when they emigrated to Israel the applicants knew full well that they would have to do military service. In short, the respondent contends that there is no palpable and overriding error which would justify this court in intervening.\nAnalysis",
    "[14]\nFirst, I could not conclude that the events experienced by the applicants constitute persecution, in light of the remarks of the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 863  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where the court stated:\n\"There is no doubt that the Board found as a fact that, while there was evidence to support discrimination against the appellant because of his religious beliefs, there was no evidence on which he could reasonably found a fear of persecution on grounds of his religious beliefs or political opinions. These were findings which it was open to the Board to make on the material before it.\"",
    "[15]\nIn addition, this court expressed the same opinion in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), in which Mr. Justice Marceau stated:\n\"It is true that the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in the refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is true also that the identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination or harassment is not purely a question of fact but a mixed question of law and fact, legal concepts being involved. It remains, however, that in all cases, it is for the Board to draw the conclusion in a particular factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein, and the intervention of this court is not warranted unless the conclusion reached appears to be capricious or unreasonable.\"",
    "[16]\nThus, with respect, I do not believe that in this case the conclusions reached by the Refugee Division could be characterized as unreasonable or capricious.",
    "[17]\nSecond, I do not believe that the Refugee Division erred in its assessment of the evidence relating to the applicants' obligation to do military service. As the Board clearly pointed out, and as the transcript shows, the applicants knew that there was compulsory military service in Israel and nonetheless decided to immigrate to that country. When this question was put to them, the applicants answered as follows:\n(Translation)\n\"Q.When you were in the Soviet Union, were you aware of the fact that you would be required to serve in the army eventually if you became a citizen of Israel?\nA.Yes, I knew. But I thought that the Israeli army was fighting against Arab terrorists. And once we got to Israel, we saw then that the actions were directed against women and children.\"",
    "[18]\nIn addition, as the Refugee Division noted, there is always the possibility of obtaining an exemption or electing to do alternative service. Finally, as Mr. Justice MacGuigan pointed out, speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant has the burden of establishing that the law of general application is inherently persecutory. This is certainly not the situation in the case at bar, since there is a possibility of exemption and alternative service.\nConclusions",
    "[19]\nAccording to counsel for the applicants, the situation for Russian immigrants in Israel is not the best. In fact, there is documentary evidence dealing with the reaction of native Israelis to the many Russians who have been admitted to the country in recent years. The test that the applicants must meet is to establish persecution imposed by the authorities, or from which that the authorities cannot provide the necessary protection.",
    "[20]\nRegardless of the evidence that all these document files provide, on either side, the facts before the panel may be summarized as three incidents of so-called persecution: the incident at the school, in which the police took no interest, since they saw it as a simple adolescent quarrel; the police investigation when the wife was stoned, which was initiated but was not pursued the next day; and finally, the threats made by some adolescents against the son. On the question of the last two incidents, it seems to me to be completely unreasonable that the applicants would not have pursued their complaints with the police. While recognizing the applicants' frustration, their conduct seems to me to have been simply a manoeuvre to establish the grounds for their claims. I would say the same about their objections to military service even before they knew the rules and the exceptions. The panel did not err in deciding that the circumstances did not constitute a well-founded, objective fear of persecution.",
    "[21]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Mr. Justice Teitelbaum of this court, faced with similar circumstances, decided that the state of Israel could not be found guilty of engaging in discrimination and that it was able to protect all its citizens. On the facts before me, I draw the same conclusions.",
    "[22]\nThe application must therefore be dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Reginald W. Curtis/nmg"

      "Applicants are citizens of Israel, originally of Russian nationality and Christian religion.",
      "Applicants emigrated from Tadzhikistan to Israel in February 1991.",
      "In May 1992, the applicants' son was physically assaulted by schoolmates in Israel; a police complaint yielded no action.",
      "In August 1992, the female applicant was struck with stones; police initiated a report but did not follow up.",
      "In September 1992, the applicants' son received death threats from adolescents; the applicants did not file a complaint.",
      "Applicants object to mandatory circumcision and military service in Israel.",
      "Applicants expressed concern about being deployed to occupied territories and alleged persecution of Russians within the Israeli army.",
      "Applicants sought refugee status in September 1993, citing religion, nationality, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group as grounds for fear of persecution.",
      "The Refugee Division denied the applicants' claim for refugee status.",
      "Applicants stated they were aware of mandatory military service in Israel prior to immigrating, believing the army fought against terrorists.",

    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "Acts of violence (beatings, stonings, threats) constitute persecution, not merely discrimination.",
        "The Refugee Division erred by equating persecution with a 'sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection', as this applies to their case due to the violation of their right to security.",
        "They only need to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, not actual persecution.",
        "The Refugee Division made an unfair comment about needing to know the laws of their country without allowing them to respond.",
        "The Refugee Division imposed additional requirements on claimants, effectively creating exclusion clauses.",
        "The military service they fear involves actions condemned by the international community and potentially constitutes war crimes.",
        "They were opposed to compulsory military service because Russians were persecuted in the Israeli army and they feared being sent to occupied territories."

      "Respondents": [
        "Discrimination does not necessarily establish a fear of persecution.",
        "The Refugee Division’s conclusions were supported by the evidence and were not perverse, capricious, or unreasonable.",
        "The applicants did not establish, with clear and convincing proof, that Israel was unable to protect them; the presumption of state protection applies.",
        "The applicants did not objectively act reasonably in seeking protection from authorities.",
        "The applicants were aware of the requirement for military service when immigrating to Israel.",
        "Israeli law regarding military service does not engender persecution as it applies equally to all and is related to the political situation.",
        "Exemptions or alternative service are available for military service.",
        "The applicants were informed the panel would consider documentary evidence and did not object."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court affirmed the Refugee Division’s finding that the applicants did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution, distinguishing between persecution and discrimination. It relied on Supreme Court of Canada precedent establishing that evidence of discrimination alone is insufficient to establish a fear of persecution.",
      "The court found the Refugee Division’s assessment of the evidence was reasonable and not capricious, deferring to the Board’s factual findings and balancing of evidence. It acknowledged the difficulty in distinguishing between persecution and discrimination, but upheld the Board’s conclusion in the specific factual context.",
      "Regarding military service, the court agreed with the Refugee Division that the applicants knew of the mandatory service requirement upon immigrating to Israel. The court emphasized that the applicants’ subsequent dissatisfaction with the nature of the military actions did not establish persecution, particularly given the availability of exemptions or alternative service options.",
      "The court applied the legal principle that an applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that a law of general application is inherently persecutory, finding that the applicants failed to meet this burden concerning Israeli military service laws.",
      "The court criticized the applicants’ conduct in failing to diligently pursue complaints with the police regarding the incidents they cited as evidence of persecution, viewing this inaction as potentially manipulative to bolster their claims. It found their lack of persistence unreasonable.",
      "The court relied on a prior Federal Court of Appeal decision and a decision by Justice Teitelbaum, finding similar circumstances did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution or demonstrate an inability of the Israeli state to provide protection to its citizens."
