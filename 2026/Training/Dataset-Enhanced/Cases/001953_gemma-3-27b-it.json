    "[1]\nPhelan, J.\n: The Applicant Minister seeks judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] accepting the appeal of Quizhen Chen from a refusal by a visa officer [Officer] to grant a family class visa to her daughter, Yingying Hong.",
    "[2]\nThe Officer refused the daughter's application for permanent residence on the basis that she was excluded from the family class because the mother failed to declare her daughter on her permanent residence application.\nII.\nRELEVANT PROVISIONS",
    "[3]\nThe key statute and regulatory provisions are as follows:\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]\n63. (1) A person who has filed in the prescribed manner an application to sponsor a foreign national as a member of the family class may appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against a decision not to issue the foreign national a permanent resident visa.\n...\n65. In an appeal under subsection 63(1) or (2) respecting an application based on membership in the family class, the Immigration Appeal Division may not consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations unless it has decided that the foreign national is a member of the family class and that their sponsor is a sponsor within the meaning of the regulations.\n...\n67. (1) To allow an appeal, the Immigration Appeal Division must be satisfied that, at the time that the appeal is disposed of,\n(a)\nthe decision appealed is wrong in law or fact or mixed law and fact;\n(b)\na principle of natural justice has not been observed; gold\n(c)\nother than in the case of an appeal by the Minister, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.\n(2) If the Immigration Appeal Division allows the appeal, it shall set aside the original decision and substitute a determination that, in its opinion, should have been made, including the making of a removal order, or refer the matter to the appropriate decision-maker for reconsideration.\n63. (1) Any person who has filed, in accordance with the regulations, an application for sponsorship for family reunification may appeal the refusal to issue the permanent resident visa.\n...\n65. In the case of an appeal referred to in subsections 63(1) or (2) of a decision relating to an application for family reunification, humanitarian reasons may only be taken into consideration if it has been ruled that the foreign national is indeed part of this category and that the sponsor has regulatory status.\n...\n67. (1) An appeal shall be allowed on proof that at the time it is disposed of:\na)\nthe contested decision is erroneous in law, in fact or in law and in fact;\nb)\nthere has been a breach of a principle of natural justice;\nc)\nexcept in the case of the Minister's appeal, there are - taking into account the best interests of the child directly affected - humanitarian reasons justifying, given the other circumstances of the case, the taking of special measures.\n(2) The contested decision is overturned; This is replaced by the one, accompanied, where appropriate, by a referral order, which should have been issued, or the case is referred to the competent authority.\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations]\n117. (9) A foreign national shall not be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if\n...\n(d)\nsubject to subsection (10), the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not examined.\n117. (9) The following persons are not considered to belong to the family reunification category because of their relationship with the sponsor:\n...\nd)\nsubject to subsection (10), where the sponsor became a permanent resident following an application to that effect, the foreign national who, at the time the application was made, was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not the subject of an examination.\nIII.\nBACKGROUND",
    "[4]\nThere is no issue that the Respondent did not declare her daughter on her permanent residence application. The Respondent became a permanent resident in April 2005, 10 years after her daughter's birth in China where she has remained.",
    "[5]\nOn December 29, 2010, the daughter applied for permanent resident status on humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds. Her application was sponsored by her mother and the daughter was listed as a dependent child.",
    "[6]\nThe Officer denied the daughter's application in early 2012. The basis of the decision is two-fold; the daughter was excluded from the family class by operation of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Regulations and there were insufficient H&C factors in the case to overcome the daughter's exclusion as a member of the family class.",
    "[7]\nOn appeal to the IAD, the IAD held that the daughter was not a member of the family class (a matter conceded at the IAD hearing). Despite this conclusion, the IAD then went on to consider the H&C finding and found that the Officer had not applied the correct test when assessing the best interests of the child because the Officer did not specifically identify the child's best interests. The IAD allowed the appeal.",
    "[8]\nDespite the finding that the daughter was not a member of the family class, the IAD found that it had jurisdiction under paragraph 67(1)(a) of IRPA to determine whether a visa officer's assessment of H&C considerations was performed correctly.\nIV.\nANALYSIS\nA.\nStandard of Review",
    "[9]\nWith respect to the IAD's jurisdiction conclusion, this issue belongs to the class of true jurisdictional questions referred to in\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , as \"narrow and exceptional\". It brings into play the interpretation of a statute of broad public interest and the matter of whether jurisdiction rests in the IAD or in the Federal Court on judicial review. The standard of review on this issue is correctness (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 29).",
    "[10]\nLikewise the issue of whether the Officer committed an error of law by applying the wrong test has been held to be subject to the correctness standard of review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[11]\nThe Applicant raised the matter of the adequacy of the reasons. To the extent that it is a relevant issue, it is not a standalone issue but part of the reasonableness analysis in respect to the decision (\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nB.\nIAD Jurisdiction",
    "[12]\nIn my view, the IAD erred in assuming it had jurisdiction over a non-family class H&C matter.",
    "[13]\nThe IAD's jurisdiction is set out in s 63. Section 63(1) gives the IAD jurisdiction over decisions not to issue a foreign national a permanent residence visa in the family class category. The other grounds of jurisdiction relate to applications by permanent residents, protected persons or the Minister relating to admissibility hearings or residency obligations. The IAD therefore has no jurisdiction over non-family class permanent residence applications; these decisions are reviewable with leave by the Federal Court.",
    "[14]\nSection 65 restricts the IAD's jurisdiction over family class permanent residence applications. The IAD may not consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations arising on an appeal from a family class application unless it has decided that the foreign national is a member of the family class and that their sponsor is a \"sponsor\" within the meaning of the class. Absent these two conditions, s 65 precludes the IAD's jurisdiction to deal with H&C considerations. There is no alternate basis for the IAD's jurisdiction over H&C matters.",
    "[15]\nWhile the term \"considerations\" is not defined, it is logically those matters in an H&C situation which must be considered. It is a broad term and encompasses not just facts or factors but mixed fact and law and law. It is intended to cover the full range of the H&C analysis.",
    "[16]\nSubsection 67(1) sets out the grounds on which the IAD may allow an appeal. Paragraph 67(1)(a) which the IAD relied on as a basis of jurisdiction sets out that the IAD can allow an appeal where it is satisfied that the decision is wrong in law or fact or mixed law and fact.",
    "[17]\nThe IAD concluded that despite this \"carve-out\" of its jurisdiction, s 67(1) gave it a \"carve-in\" to deal with matters, at least, of law in a decision denying a foreign national a permanent resident visa.",
    "[18]\nWith great respect, I cannot read s 67(1) in the way that the IAD has concluded. Section 67 does not confer jurisdiction but rather sets out the standard of review. If the IAD had the jurisdiction to examine a matter of law (in this case the applicable legal test) based on paragraph 67(1)(a), it would likewise have the jurisdiction (and responsibility) to examine the factual and the mixed facts and law issues. Such an interpretation would largely render the \"carve-out\" in s 65 meaningless. Under that interpretation, H&C considerations would be precluded in the present case by s 65 but all issues of law, fact and mixed fact and law would be brought back into IAD jurisdiction by s 67(1)(a).",
    "[19]\nThere was some effort to suggest that only if a child was involved would the IAD have jurisdiction to engage in an H&C analysis. However, that view would have the effect of making a non-family class member a family class member if the person was a child.",
    "[20]\nThe statutory intent of s 65 was to limit IAD jurisdiction in the case of non-family member H&C considerations. Efforts to negate that jurisdictional limitation are inconsistent with the intent of s 65. Section 67 remains alive and vibrant in respect of family class member applicants. It would lead to undue complexity to have the IAD in, then out, then back in again on jurisdiction over the same subject matter.",
    "[21]\nOnce the IAD determines that the foreign national is a non-family member (or the sponsor is not a defined sponsor), that ends its jurisdiction in respect of any claim for H&C consideration. The route of review in those situations is to the Federal Court by way of leave for judicial review.",
    "[22]\nOnce the IAD concluded that the Respondent's daughter was a non-family member by reason of paragraph 117(9)(d), its jurisdiction to consider the H&C claim was ended. The limited jurisdiction over H&C matters set out in s 65 was not available.",
    "[23]\nThe parties raised a number of decisions of this Court which touched upon, if not dealing directly, with this jurisdictional issue. The Respondent's reliance on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 574, is undercut by the absence of any discussion in that case of the proper interpretation of s 65. I do not take Justice O'Reilly as having dealt with the nature and effect of the carve-out in s 65.",
    "[24]\nIn my view, a case of closer relevance is Justice Shore's decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 683. His finding of absence of jurisdiction is compatible with my conclusion.",
    "[25]\nTherefore, the IAD erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction to review the Officer's decision.\nC.\nH&C Analysis",
    "[26]\nEven if I am in error on this first issue, I find that the IAD's analysis of the Officer's H&C consideration is in error and unreasonable.",
    "[27]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 306 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Mosley cut through the issue of best interests of the child and H&C hardship matters to hold that one must look at the realities of the decision to determine if the best interests were considered and not to become lost in formulaic language (para 11 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[28]\nHaving reviewed the Officer's decision, he was \"alert, alive and sensitive to the child's best interests\" (also formulaic language) in that he addressed the major points of \"best interests\" and reached a reasonable conclusion on the facts.",
    "[29]\nOn this ground as well, the IAD's decision is in error.\nD.\nAdequacy of Reasons",
    "[30]\nNothing more need be said on this point as the Officer's line of reasoning was clear; the parties knew the basis for the decision and it was reasonable in all the circumstances.\nV.\nCONCLUSION",
    "[31]\nFor all these reasons, this judicial review will be granted. The IAD decision will be quashed and the Visa Officer's decision restored.",
    "[32]\nThe Respondent proposed a certified question and the Applicant made extensive submissions opposing certification. The test for certification was laid out in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), 176 NR 4.",
    "[33]\nThe question posed by the Respondent dealt with provisions and issues not argued and there is not a proper question for certification.",
    "[34]\nWhile the issue of IAD jurisdiction under s 65 may well transcend the interests of the parties, it is not sufficient by disposition of this particular judicial review as presented because of the finding of correctness and reasonableness in respect to the H&C consideration.",
    "[35]\nTherefore, no question will be certified.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[36]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted, the IAD decision is quashed and the Visa Officer's decision is restored.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/vnh"

The IAD allowed the appeal.\n\n[8]\nDespite the finding that the daughter was not a member of the family class, the IAD found that it had jurisdiction under paragraph 67(1)(a) of IRPA to determine whether a visa officer's assessment of H&C considerations was performed correctly.\nIV.\nANALYSIS\nA.\nStandard of Review\n\n[9]\nWith respect to the IAD's jurisdiction conclusion, this issue belongs to the class of true jurisdictional questions referred to in\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , as \"narrow and exceptional\". It brings into play the interpretation of a statute of broad public interest and the matter of whether jurisdiction rests in the IAD or in the Federal Court on judicial review. The standard of review on this issue is correctness (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 29).\n\n[10]\nLikewise the issue of whether the Officer committed an error of law by applying the wrong test has been held to be subject to the correctness standard of review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[11]\nThe Applicant raised the matter of the adequacy of the reasons. To the extent that it is a relevant issue, it is not a standalone issue but part of the reasonableness analysis in respect to the decision (\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nB.\nIAD Jurisdiction\n\n[12]\nIn my view, the IAD erred in assuming it had jurisdiction over a non-family class H&C matter.\n\n[13]\nThe IAD's jurisdiction is set out in s 63. Section 63(1) gives the IAD jurisdiction over decisions not to issue a foreign national a permanent residence visa in the family class category. The other grounds of jurisdiction relate to applications by permanent residents, protected persons or the Minister relating to admissibility hearings or residency obligations. The IAD therefore has no jurisdiction over non-family class permanent residence applications; these decisions are reviewable with leave by the Federal Court.\n\n[14]\nSection 65 restricts the IAD's jurisdiction over family class permanent residence applications. The IAD may not consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations arising on an appeal from a family class application unless it has decided that the foreign national is a member of the family class and that their sponsor is a \"sponsor\" within the meaning of the class. Absent these two conditions, s 65 precludes the IAD's jurisdiction to deal with H&C considerations. There is no alternate basis for the IAD's jurisdiction over H&C matters.\n\n[15]\nWhile the term \"considerations\" is not defined, it is logically those matters in an H&C situation which must be considered. It is a broad term and encompasses not just facts or factors but mixed fact and law and law. It is intended to cover the full range of the H&C analysis.\n\n[16]\nSubsection 67(1) sets out the grounds on which the IAD may allow an appeal. Paragraph 67(1)(a) which the IAD relied on as a basis of jurisdiction sets out that the IAD can allow an appeal where it is satisfied that the decision is wrong in law or fact or mixed law and fact.\n\n[17]\nThe IAD concluded that despite this \"carve-out\" of its jurisdiction, s 67(1) gave it a \"carve-in\" to deal with matters, at least, of law in a decision denying a foreign national a permanent resident visa.\n\n[18]\nWith great respect, I cannot read s 67(1) in the way that the IAD has concluded. Section 67 does not confer jurisdiction but rather sets out the standard of review. If the IAD had the jurisdiction to examine a matter of law (in this case the applicable legal test) based on paragraph 67(1)(a), it would likewise have the jurisdiction (and responsibility) to examine the factual and the mixed facts and law issues. Such an interpretation would largely render the \"carve-out\" in s 65 meaningless. Under that interpretation, H&C considerations would be precluded in the present case by s 65 but all issues of law, fact and mixed fact and law would be brought back into IAD jurisdiction by s 67(1)(a).\n\n[19]\nThere was some effort to suggest that only if a child was involved would the IAD have jurisdiction to engage in an H&C analysis. However, that view would have the effect of making a non-family class member a family class member if the person was a child.\n\n[20]\nThe statutory intent of s 65 was to limit IAD jurisdiction in the case of non-family member H&C considerations. Efforts to negate that jurisdictional limitation are inconsistent with the intent of s 65. Section 67 remains alive and vibrant in respect of family class member applicants. It would lead to undue complexity to have the IAD in, then out, then back in again on jurisdiction over the same subject matter.\n\n[21]\nOnce the IAD determines that the foreign national is a non-family member (or the sponsor is not a defined sponsor), that ends its jurisdiction in respect of any claim for H&C consideration. The route of review in those situations is to the Federal Court by way of leave for judicial review.\n\n[22]\nOnce the IAD concluded that the Respondent's daughter was a non-family member by reason of paragraph 117(9)(d), its jurisdiction to consider the H&C claim was ended. The limited jurisdiction over H&C matters set out in s 65 was not available.\n\n[23]\nThe parties raised a number of decisions of this Court which touched upon, if not dealing directly, with this jurisdictional issue. The Respondent's reliance on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 574, is undercut by the absence of any discussion in that case of the proper interpretation of s 65. I do not take Justice O'Reilly as having dealt with the nature and effect of the carve-out in s 65.\n\n[24]\nIn my view, a case of closer relevance is Justice Shore's decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 683. His finding of absence of jurisdiction is compatible with my conclusion.\n\n[25]\nTherefore, the IAD erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction to review the Officer's decision.\nC.\nH&C Analysis\n\n[26]\nEven if I am in error on this first issue, I find that the IAD's analysis of the Officer's H&C consideration is in error and unreasonable.\n\n[27]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 306 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Mosley cut through the issue of best interests of the child and H&C hardship matters to hold that one must look at the realities of the decision to determine if the best interests were considered and not to become lost in formulaic language (para 11 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[28]\nHaving reviewed the Officer's decision, he was \"alert, alive and sensitive to the child's best interests\" (also formulaic language) in that he addressed the major points of \"best interests\" and reached a reasonable conclusion on the facts.\n\n[29]\nOn this ground as well, the IAD's decision is in error.\nD.\nAdequacy of Reasons\n\n[30]\nNothing more need be said on this point as the Officer's line of reasoning was clear; the parties knew the basis for the decision and it was reasonable in all the circumstances.\nV.\nCONCLUSION\n\n[31]\nFor all these reasons, this judicial review will be granted. The IAD decision will be quashed and the Visa Officer's decision restored.\n\n[32]\nThe Respondent proposed a certified question and the Applicant made extensive submissions opposing certification. The test for certification was laid out in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), 176 NR 4.\n\n[33]\nThe question posed by the Respondent dealt with provisions and issues not argued and there is not a proper question for certification.\n\n[34]\nWhile the issue of IAD jurisdiction under s 65 may well transcend the interests of the parties, it is not sufficient by disposition of this particular judicial review as presented because of the finding of correctness and reasonableness in respect to the H&C consideration.\n\n[35]\nTherefore, no question will be certified.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[36]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted, the IAD decision is quashed and the Visa Officer's decision is restored.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/vnh",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) had jurisdiction to review the Visa Officer’s decision regarding humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) considerations after determining the daughter was not a member of the family class. The court determined the IAD erred in assuming jurisdiction, applying a correctness standard of review to the jurisdictional question.",
      "The court interpreted sections 63 and 65 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) to establish that the IAD’s jurisdiction over H&C considerations is contingent on first determining the individual *is* a member of the family class.  Section 65 explicitly restricts H&C consideration unless family class membership and sponsor status are established. The court found that once the IAD determined the daughter was *not* a family class member under paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Regulations, its jurisdiction to consider H&C factors ceased.",
      "The court rejected the IAD’s argument that section 67(1)(a) of IRPA created a “carve-in” to jurisdiction, allowing review of legal errors even in the absence of family class status. The court reasoned that such an interpretation would render the jurisdictional “carve-out” in section 65 meaningless, creating undue complexity and inconsistency.",
      "The court clarified that section 67(1) sets out the *standard* of review, not a source of jurisdiction. If the IAD had jurisdiction under 67(1)(a), it would have jurisdiction over all aspects of the case (fact, law, mixed), which would undermine the limitations set out in section 65.",
      "Even assuming the IAD *did* have jurisdiction, the court found the IAD’s analysis of the Visa Officer’s H&C assessment was unreasonable. Applying the principles from *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa*, the court found the Officer had adequately considered the best interests of the child and reached a reasonable conclusion, demonstrating sensitivity to the child’s situation.",
      "The court found the Visa Officer’s reasoning was clear and sufficient, rejecting any argument regarding the adequacy of reasons. The Officer addressed the key “best interests” points and reached a reasonable conclusion based on the facts.",
      "The court denied the request for certification of a question for appeal, finding the proposed question dealt with issues not fully argued before the court and that the jurisdictional issue, while potentially broader, wasn’t suitable for certification given the correctness and reasonableness findings regarding the H&C consideration."
