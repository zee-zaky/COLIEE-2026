    "[1]\nBlais, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under section 72 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), of a decision dated February 7, 2006, by the visa officer of the Canadian Embassy in Damascus, who refused to issue to the applicant a temporary resident visa as a member of the worker class.",
    "[2]\nFor the following reasons, I am satisfied that the application for judicial review should be dismissed.\nRELEVANT FACTS",
    "[3]\nGhassan Al Nahhas (the applicant) is a businessman and a citizen of Syria.",
    "[4]\nOn December 21, 2005, the applicant applied for a temporary resident visa as a member of the worker class. At that time, the applicant was the president and sole employee of L.E.N.K.E.R., a company registered in the province of Quebec in 2005.\nIMPUGNED DECISION",
    "[5]\nIn a decision dated February 7, 2006, Paul Jamieson, a visa officer at the Canadian Embassy in Syria (the visa officer), dismissed the applicants application for a temporary visa because he was not satisfied that the applicant would leave Canada at the end of the authorized period.\nISSUES",
    "[6]\nThe issues in this case are as follows:\n(1) Did the visa officer make an error in assessing the evidence which would warrant intervention by this Court?\n(2) Did the visa officer breach his duty of fairness to the applicant?\nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS",
    "[7] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act)\n11\n. (1) A foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this Act.\n20\n. (1) Every foreign national, other than a foreign national referred to in section 19, who seeks to enter or remain in Canada must establish,\n(a) to become a permanent resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and have come to Canada in order to establish permanent residence; and\n(b) to become a temporary resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\n11\n. (1) The foreign national must, prior to entering Canada, ask the officer for visas and other documents required by regulation, which are issued upon proof, following an inspection, that he is not inadmissible and complies with this Act.\n20\n. (1) A foreign national not covered by section 19 who seeks to enter or stay in Canada must prove:\na) to become a permanent resident, he holds the visa or other regulatory documents and comes to settle there permanently;\nb) to become a temporary resident, he holds the visa or other documents required by regulation and will have left Canada at the end of the authorized period of stay.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW",
    "[8]\nThe issuance of a temporary resident visa by a visa officer is a discretionary decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[9]\nAs the Federal Court of Appeal explained in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the patent unreasonableness standard is equivalent to paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended by S.C. 1990, c.-8, which provides that the Federal Court may intervene in the case of a mistake of fact in a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal only if that board, commission or tribunal based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.",
    "[10]\nHowever, when a matter of procedural fairness is involved, it is trite law that the applicable standard of review is correctness, because this is a question of law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Accordingly, if the Court concludes that there has been a breach of procedural fairness, the application for judicial review will be allowed.\nANALYSIS\n1)\nDid the visa officer make an error in assessing the evidence which would warrant intervention by this Court?",
    "[11]\nThe visa officer refused to issue a temporary resident visa to the applicant because he was not satisfied that the applicant would leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for his stay, as required under paragraph 20(1)(b) of the Act. According to the notes in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS), the decision of the visa officer was based on the following statements made by the applicant at his interview:\n(1) The applicant allegedly stated that he did not know when he would return to Syria and later mentioned that he would remain in Canada for approximately five to seven years;\n(2) The applicant allegedly planned on living in Canada with his family during this period and in fact had applied for temporary resident visas for his wife and two children;\n(3) The applicant allegedly intended to sell his house in Syria and buy one in Canada.",
    "[12]\nIn the affidavit submitted in support of his application for judicial review before this Court, the applicant states having mentioned that his children were studying in Syria and would not accompany him to Canada and that, since he owned many properties in Syria, he had no intention of selling all of them. In answer to the applicants arguments, the visa officer also submitted an affidavit in which he maintained the version of the facts noted in the CAIPS.",
    "[13]\nIn addition, the applicant submits that the visa officer did not take into consideration the fact that he had always respected the conditions of his visitor visas in the past. In his affidavit, however, the visa officer confirms that he considered this fact but simply did not attach decisive weight to it.",
    "[14]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 42, Mr. Justice Paul Rouleau wrote the following:\nIn my view, the Court should attach greater weight to the visa officers testimony about what took place during the interview, for the following reasons. First, it is corroborated by the notes she recopied into the CAIPS system, which make absolutely no mention of problems communicating with the applicant, whereas there is nothing to support or confirm the applicants allegations. Further, the officers notes were re-transcribed into the CAIPS the day after the interview with the applicant, namely March 21, 2001, when the events were still fresh in her memory, and the applicants affidavit, on the other hand, dates from August 31, 2001, over five months after the interview. In my opinion the fact that the CAIPS notes, which corroborate the officers testimony, were contemporaneous is a sufficient reason to prefer her testimony to that of the applicant.",
    "[15]\nAlso, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 18, Mr. Justice Michel Beaudry wrote the following:\nBased on a review of the CAIPS entries, which are dated the same date as the decision, as well as the evidence from both parties, the Court finds that the Visa Officer did not breach her duty of fairness to the applicant. Although there was no obligation to do so, the Visa Officer did express her misgivings and invited the applicant to provide further documentation to persuade her that his wealth was not gleaned from illegitimate sources. Unfortunately, the applicant said he had no further information. I attach greater weight to the Visa Officers affidavit about what took place during the interview because the CAIPS entries were done the same day and there is no mention that the applicant would have the opportunity to submit further documentation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 600 (F.C.T.D.) (QL)).",
    "[16]\nI have no hesitation in concluding, as my colleagues Rouleau J. and Beaudry J. have done, that more weight should be attached to the testimony of the visa officer concerning what happened at the interview, which is consistent with the CAIPS notes.",
    "[17]\nHaving attentively studied the evidence that was before the visa officer when he made his decision, as well as the reasons on which this decision was based, I cannot conclude that he based his decision on an erroneous finding of fact that he made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before him.\n2)\nDid the visa officer breach his duty of fairness to the applicant?",
    "[18]\nThe applicant submits as his second argument that the decision of the visa officer was tainted with prejudice and that the visa officer was biased.",
    "[19]\nThe respondent argues that an allegation of bias is serious and must not be made lightly. The Federal Court of Appeal stated the following in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n. . . An allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard . . . .",
    "[20]\nThe applicant did not submit any evidence in support of this allegation, other than his statement that the interview lasted only five minutes, something which the visa officer denies in his affidavit. Accordingly, the applicants allegations are insufficient to establish any breach of procedural fairness whatsoever.",
    "[21]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review must be dismissed.",
    "[22]\nCounsel did not submit any question for certification.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[23]\nThe application for judicial review is dismissed.",

À lépoque, le demandeur était le président et seul employé de L.E.N.K.E.R., une compagnie immatriculée dans la province de Québec en 2005.\nDÉCISION CONTESTÉE\n[5]\nDans une décision rendue le 7 février 2006, Paul Jamieson, lagent des visas de lAmbassade du Canada en Syrie (lagent des visas), a rejeté la demande de visa temporaire du demandeur, car il nétait pas satisfait que ce dernier quitterait le Canada à la fin de la période autorisée.\nQUESTIONS EN LITIGE\n[6]\nLes questions en litige dans la présente demande sont les suivantes :\n1) Lagent des visas a-t-il commis une erreur dans lappréciation de la preuve justifiant lintervention de cette Cour?\n2) Lagent des visas a-t-il manqué à son devoir déquité envers le demandeur?\nEXTRAITS LÉGISLATIFS PERTINENTS\n[7]\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (la Loi)\n11.\n(1) Létranger doit, préalablement à son entrée au Canada, demander à lagent les visa et autres documents requis par règlement, lesquels sont délivrés sur preuve, à la suite dun contrôle, quil nest pas interdit de territoire et se conforme à la présente loi.\n20.\n(1) Létranger non visé à larticle 19 qui cherche à entrer au Canada ou à y séjourner est tenu de prouver:\na) pour devenir un résident permanent, quil détient les visa ou autres documents réglementaires et vient sy établir en permanence;\nb) pour devenir un résident temporaire, quil détient les visa ou autres documents requis par règlement et aura quitté le Canada à la fin de la période de séjour autorisée.\n11.\n(1) A foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this Act.\n20.\n(1) Every foreign national, other than a foreign national referred to in section 19, who seeks to enter or remain in Canada must establish,\n(a) to become a permanent resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and have come to Canada in order to establish permanent residence; and\n(b) to become a temporary resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\nNORME DE CONTRÔLE\n[8]\nLattribution dun visa de résidence temporaire par un agent des visas constitue une décision discrétionnaire ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[9]\nComme lexpliquait la Cour dappel fédérale dans larrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la norme de la décision manifestement déraisonnable est léquivalent de lalinéa 18.1(4)d) de la Loi sur les Cours fédérales, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7, tel que modifié par L.C. 1990, ch. 8, lequel prévoit que la Cour fédérale ne peut intervenir en cas derreur de fait dans une décision dun office général que si ce dernier a rendu une décision fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont il disposait.\n[10]\nPar contre, lorsquil sagit dune question déquité procédurale, il est bien établi que la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision correcte, puisquil sagit dune question de droit (Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Par conséquent, si la Cour conclut quil y a eu un manquement à léquité procédurale, la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accordée.\nANALYSE\n1) Lagent des visas a-t-il commis une erreur dans lappréciation de la preuve justifiant lintervention de cette Cour?\n[11]\nLagent des visas a refusé au demandeur un visa de résidence temporaire parce quil nétait pas convaincu que le demandeur quitterait le Canada au terme de la période de son séjour autorisé, tel que requis par lalinéa 20(1)b) de la Loi. Selon les notes inscrites au Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers dimmigration (STIDI), la décision de lagent des visas sappuie sur les déclarations suivantes du demandeur faites lors de son entrevue :\n1) Le demandeur aurait déclaré quil ne savait pas quand il retournerait en Syrie, pour plus tard mentionner quil demeurerait au Canada environ cinq à sept ans;\n2) Le demandeur compterait vivre au Canada avec sa famille durant cette période, et demandait dailleurs un visa de résidence temporaire pour sa femme et ses deux enfants;\n3) Le demandeur aurait lintention de vendre sa maison en Syrie et dacheter une maison au Canada.\n[12]\nDans laffidavit soumis à lappui de sa demande de contrôle judiciaire devant cette Cour, le demandeur affirme avoir mentionné plutôt que ses enfants poursuivaient des études en Syrie et quils ne laccompagneraient pas au Canada et que, possédant plusieurs propriétés en Syrie, il navait pas lintention de liquider toutes ces propriétés. En réponse aux allégations du demandeur, lagent des visas soumet aussi un affidavit dans lequel il maintient la version des faits notés dans le STIDI.\n[13]\nLe demandeur soumet de plus que lagent des visas na pas tenu compte du fait quil avait toujours respecté les conditions de ses visas de visiteurs dans le passé. Dans son affidavit, lagent des visas affirme au contraire avoir considéré cet élément, mais ne lui avoir tout simplement pas accordé un poids déterminant.\n[14]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 42, le juge Paul Rouleau précise :\nÀ mon avis, il convient daccorder plus de poids au témoignage de lagent des visas au sujet de ce qui sest passé durant lentrevue pour les raisons suivantes. Dune part, celui-ci est corroboré par les notes quelle a retranscrites dans le système CAIPS, lesquelles ne font nulle mention de difficultés de communications avec le demandeur, alors quaucun élément ne vient appuyer ou confirmer les allégations du demandeur. En outre, les notes de lagent ont été retranscrites dans le CAIPS le lendemain de lentrevue du demandeur, soit le 21 mars 2001, alors que les événements étaient encore frais dans sa mémoire, et laffidavit du demandeur date pour sa part du 31 août 2001, soit plus de cinq mois après lentrevue. La contemporanéité des notes du CAIPS, qui corroborent le témoignage de lagent, constitue à mon avis une raison suffisante de préférer son témoignage à celui du demandeur.\n[15]\nÉgalement, dans  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 18, le juge Michel Beaudry déclare:\nBased on a review of the CAIPS entries, which are dated the same date as the decision, as well as the evidence from both parties, the Court finds that the Visa Officer did not breach her duty of fairness to the applicant. Although there was no obligation to do so, the Visa Officer did express her misgivings and invited the applicant to provide further documentation to persuade her that his wealth was not gleaned from illegitimate sources. Unfortunately, the applicant said he had no further information. I attach greater weight to the Visa Officers affidavit about what took place during the interview because the CAIPS entries were done the same day and there is no mention that the applicant would have the opportunity to submit further documentation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 600 (F.C.T.D.) (QL)).\n[16]\nJe nai aucune hésitation à conclure, comme mes collègues les juges Rouleau et Beaudry, quil convient daccorder plus de poids au témoignage de lagent des visas au sujet de ce qui sest passé en entrevue, qui est en conformité avec les  CAIPS notes .\n[17]\nAyant examiné attentivement la preuve dont disposait lagent des visas pour rendre sa décision, ainsi que les motifs à lappui de cette décision, je ne peux conclure que ce dernier a rendu une décision fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont il disposait.\n2) Lagent des visas a-t-il manqué à son devoir déquité envers le demandeur?\n[18]\nLe demandeur soumet en deuxième lieu que la décision de lagent des visas était empreinte de préjugés et que ce dernier a fait preuve de partialité.\n[19]\nTel que le maintient le défendeur, une allégation de partialité est une allégation sérieuse qui ne doit pas être faite à la légère. Comme laffirmait la Cour dappel fédérale dans larrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[...] Une allégation de partialité, surtout la partialité actuelle et non simplement appréhendée, portée à l'encontre d'un tribunal, est une allégation sérieuse. Elle met en doute l'intégrité du tribunal et des membres qui ont participé à la décision attaquée. Elle ne peut être faite à la légère. Elle ne peut reposer sur de simples soupçons, de pures conjectures, des insinuations ou encore de simples impressions d'un demandeur ou de son procureur. Elle doit être étayée par des preuves concrètes qui font ressortir un comportement dérogatoire à la norme. [...]\n[20]\nLe demandeur ne soumet aucune preuve à lappui, autre que son affirmation que lentrevue na duré que cinq minutes, ce que lagent des visas nie dans son affidavit. Les allégations du demandeur sont donc insuffisantes pour établir un manquement quelconque à léquité procédurale.\n[21]\nPour ces motifs, la demande de contrôle judiciaire doit donc être rejetée.\n[22]\nLes procureurs nont soumis aucune question pour certification.\nJUGEMENT\n[23]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n[24]\nAucune question ne sera certifiée.\n[End of document]",

At that time, the applicant was the president and sole employee of L.E.N.K.E.R., a company registered in the province of Quebec in 2005.\nIMPUGNED DECISION\n\n[5]\nIn a decision dated February 7, 2006, Paul Jamieson, a visa officer at the Canadian Embassy in Syria (the visa officer), dismissed the applicants application for a temporary visa because he was not satisfied that the applicant would leave Canada at the end of the authorized period.\nISSUES\n\n[6]\nThe issues in this case are as follows:\n(1) Did the visa officer make an error in assessing the evidence which would warrant intervention by this Court?\n(2) Did the visa officer breach his duty of fairness to the applicant?\nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS\n\n[7] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act)\n11\n. (1) A foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this Act.\n20\n. (1) Every foreign national, other than a foreign national referred to in section 19, who seeks to enter or remain in Canada must establish,\n(a) to become a permanent resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and have come to Canada in order to establish permanent residence; and\n(b) to become a temporary resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\n11\n. (1) The foreign national must, prior to entering Canada, ask the officer for visas and other documents required by regulation, which are issued upon proof, following an inspection, that he is not inadmissible and complies with this Act.\n20\n. (1) A foreign national not covered by section 19 who seeks to enter or stay in Canada must prove:\na) to become a permanent resident, he holds the visa or other regulatory documents and comes to settle there permanently;\nb) to become a temporary resident, he holds the visa or other documents required by regulation and will have left Canada at the end of the authorized period of stay.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[8]\nThe issuance of a temporary resident visa by a visa officer is a discretionary decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[9]\nAs the Federal Court of Appeal explained in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the patent unreasonableness standard is equivalent to paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended by S.C. 1990, c.-8, which provides that the Federal Court may intervene in the case of a mistake of fact in a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal only if that board, commission or tribunal based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.\n\n[10]\nHowever, when a matter of procedural fairness is involved, it is trite law that the applicable standard of review is correctness, because this is a question of law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Accordingly, if the Court concludes that there has been a breach of procedural fairness, the application for judicial review will be allowed.\nANALYSIS\n1)\nDid the visa officer make an error in assessing the evidence which would warrant intervention by this Court?\n\n[11]\nThe visa officer refused to issue a temporary resident visa to the applicant because he was not satisfied that the applicant would leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for his stay, as required under paragraph 20(1)(b) of the Act. According to the notes in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS), the decision of the visa officer was based on the following statements made by the applicant at his interview:\n(1) The applicant allegedly stated that he did not know when he would return to Syria and later mentioned that he would remain in Canada for approximately five to seven years;\n(2) The applicant allegedly planned on living in Canada with his family during this period and in fact had applied for temporary resident visas for his wife and two children;\n(3) The applicant allegedly intended to sell his house in Syria and buy one in Canada.\n\n[12]\nIn the affidavit submitted in support of his application for judicial review before this Court, the applicant states having mentioned that his children were studying in Syria and would not accompany him to Canada and that, since he owned many properties in Syria, he had no intention of selling all of them. In answer to the applicants arguments, the visa officer also submitted an affidavit in which he maintained the version of the facts noted in the CAIPS.\n\n[13]\nIn addition, the applicant submits that the visa officer did not take into consideration the fact that he had always respected the conditions of his visitor visas in the past. In his affidavit, however, the visa officer confirms that he considered this fact but simply did not attach decisive weight to it.\n\n[14]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 42, Mr. Justice Paul Rouleau wrote the following:\nIn my view, the Court should attach greater weight to the visa officers testimony about what took place during the interview, for the following reasons. First, it is corroborated by the notes she recopied into the CAIPS system, which make absolutely no mention of problems communicating with the applicant, whereas there is nothing to support or confirm the applicants allegations. Further, the officers notes were re-transcribed into the CAIPS the day after the interview with the applicant, namely March 21, 2001, when the events were still fresh in her memory, and the applicants affidavit, on the other hand, dates from August 31, 2001, over five months after the interview. In my opinion the fact that the CAIPS notes, which corroborate the officers testimony, were contemporaneous is a sufficient reason to prefer her testimony to that of the applicant.\n\n[15]\nAlso, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 18, Mr. Justice Michel Beaudry wrote the following:\nBased on a review of the CAIPS entries, which are dated the same date as the decision, as well as the evidence from both parties, the Court finds that the Visa Officer did not breach her duty of fairness to the applicant. Although there was no obligation to do so, the Visa Officer did express her misgivings and invited the applicant to provide further documentation to persuade her that his wealth was not gleaned from illegitimate sources. Unfortunately, the applicant said he had no further information. I attach greater weight to the Visa Officers affidavit about what took place during the interview because the CAIPS entries were done the same day and there is no mention that the applicant would have the opportunity to submit further documentation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 600 (F.C.T.D.) (QL)).\n\n[16]\nI have no hesitation in concluding, as my colleagues Rouleau J. and Beaudry J. have done, that more weight should be attached to the testimony of the visa officer concerning what happened at the interview, which is consistent with the CAIPS notes.\n\n[17]\nHaving attentively studied the evidence that was before the visa officer when he made his decision, as well as the reasons on which this decision was based, I cannot conclude that he based his decision on an erroneous finding of fact that he made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before him.\n2)\nDid the visa officer breach his duty of fairness to the applicant?\n\n[18]\nThe applicant submits as his second argument that the decision of the visa officer was tainted with prejudice and that the visa officer was biased.\n\n[19]\nThe respondent argues that an allegation of bias is serious and must not be made lightly. The Federal Court of Appeal stated the following in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n. . . An allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard . . . .\n\n[20]\nThe applicant did not submit any evidence in support of this allegation, other than his statement that the interview lasted only five minutes, something which the visa officer denies in his affidavit. Accordingly, the applicants allegations are insufficient to establish any breach of procedural fairness whatsoever.\n\n[21]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review must be dismissed.\n\n[22]\nCounsel did not submit any question for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[23]\nThe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n\n[24]\nNo question will be certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> application for judicial review, presented under section 72 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), against a decision rendered on February 7, 2006 by the visa officer at the Canadian Embassy in Damascus, refusing to grant the applicant a temporary residence visa in the worker category.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court dismissed the application for judicial review, finding no error in the visa officer’s decision to deny the temporary resident visa.",
      "The court applied the standard of review of 'patent unreasonableness' to the factual findings of the visa officer, noting that intervention is only warranted if the officer’s findings were perverse, capricious, or disregarded material evidence.",
      "The core of the visa officer’s decision rested on statements made by the applicant during his interview, specifically regarding his uncertain return date to Syria, plans to live in Canada with his family, and intention to sell property in Syria – all suggesting an intent not to leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay.",
      "The court gave greater weight to the visa officer’s testimony and the contemporaneous CAIPS notes documenting the interview, finding them more reliable than the applicant’s affidavit which was submitted months later. This aligns with precedent emphasizing the reliability of contemporaneous notes.",
      "The court referenced previous cases (Rouleau J. and Beaudry J.) to support its reasoning for prioritizing the visa officer’s account and CAIPS notes over the applicant’s conflicting statements.",
      "Regarding the duty of fairness, the court found no breach. The applicant alleged bias but provided no supporting evidence beyond a disputed claim about the interview length, which was denied by the visa officer. The court reiterated the high standard required to establish bias, requiring material evidence, not mere suspicion.",
      "The court interpreted section 20(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which requires a temporary resident to prove they will leave Canada at the end of their authorized stay, as the basis for the visa officer’s assessment. The officer was not satisfied the applicant met this requirement based on the interview.",
      "The court determined the visa officer had considered the applicant’s history of complying with visitor visa conditions but did not find it to be a decisive factor, which was within the officer’s discretion."
