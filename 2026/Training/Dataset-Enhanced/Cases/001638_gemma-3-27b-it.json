    "[1]\nJudge Pinard\n: This is an application for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the IRB) rendered on February 26, 2003, ruling that the applicant is not a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the Convention nor a \"person in need of protection\" according to the definitions given in sections 96 and 97 respectively of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, ch. 27.",
    "[2]\nLeticia Obeng (the plaintiff) is a Christian and a citizen of Ghana where she is a member of the Akan tribe.

    "[3]\nThe IRB concluded that the applicant was neither a Convention \"refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\" because her allegations were not credible.",
    "[4]\nThe IRB provided several reasons why it concluded that the Applicant's account was not credible. The court noted, among other things, the inconsistency between the plaintiff's allegation that she fears her father and the information contained in the Certificate of Registration in the Birth Registry, the plaintiff's omission to mention her fear of Mr. Banda at the point of entry, and the implausibility of the plaintiff's statements about the financial means that allowed her to undertake the trip to Canada. A review of the file reveals that the plaintiff's explanations in this regard were simply deemed insufficient. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal held that the court's perception that the applicant is not credible on an important aspect of the claim can lead to the conclusion that there is no credible element on which the claim can be based. The court was therefore justified in relying on these inconsistencies, omissions and implausibilities to conclude that the plaintiff was not credible in view of her subjective fear.",

Elle allègue craindre la persécution en raison de sa participation dans un groupe social, les femmes, parce que son père l'a forcée à épouser un homme musulman qui exige qu'elle subisse une mutilation génitale des femmes.\n[3]\nLa CISR a conclu que la demanderesse n'est ni une \"réfugiée\" au sens de la Convention ni une \"personne à protéger\" parce que ses allégations n'étaient pas crédibles.\n[4]\nLa CISR a indiqué plusieurs raisons pour lesquelles elle a conclu que le récit de la demanderesse n'était pas crédible. Le tribunal a noté, entre autres, l'incohérence entre l'allégation de la demanderesse qu'elle craint son père et l'information contenue dans le Certificat d'enregistrement dans le registre des naissances, l'omission par la demanderesse de mentionner sa crainte de M. Banda au point d'entrée, et l'invraisemblance des déclarations de la demanderesse au sujet des moyens financiers qui lui ont permis d'entreprendre le voyage au Canada. Une révision du dossier révèle que les explications de la demanderesse à cet égard ont tout simplement été jugées insuffisantes. Dans l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué que la perception du tribunal que le demandeur n'est pas crédible sur un aspect important de la demande peut mener à la conclusion qu'il n'existe aucun élément crédible sur lequel la demande peut se fonder. Le tribunal était donc justifiéde se fonder sur ces incohérence, omission et invraisemblance pour conclure que la demanderesse n'était pas crédible en regard de sa crainte subjective.\n[5]\nComme je l'ai indiqué antérieurement, notamment dans l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 486 (QL): \"En semblables circonstances, la CISR peut conclure à l'encontre d'un revendicateur du statut de réfugié ou de personne à protéger sans avoir à considérer sa crainte objective de persécution ou la nécessité de devoir accorder la protection à d'autres personnes que lui en regard de son pays d'origine.\"\n[6]\nEn conséquence, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n....................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  application for judicial review of the decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the IRB), dated February 26, 2003, that the applicant is not a \"Convention refugee\" or a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of sections 96 and 97, respectively, of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2]\nLeticia Obeng (the applicant) is Christian and a citizen of Ghana, where she is a member of the Akan tribe.
