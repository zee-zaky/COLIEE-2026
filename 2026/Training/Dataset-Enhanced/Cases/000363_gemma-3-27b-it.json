    "[1]\nRouleau, J.\n: This is an appeal pursuant to s. 56 of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, from the decision of the Chairman of the Trademarks Opposition Board (hereinafter referred to as the Registrar of Trademarks), rejecting the appellant's opposition to the registration of the respondent's trademark \"Wallys\".",
    "[2]\nThe appellant is the registered owner of the trademark \"Bally\" which has been registered in Canada under registration Nos. TMDA16547, UCA50569, TMA285,315 and TMA285,783 for use in association with a wide variety of footwear, clothing and accessories. The first sales of \"Bally\" products in Canada occurred as early as the 1920's. Since 1951, \"Bally\" products have been distributed by a Canadian subsidiary, now known as Bally Canada Inc., with head offices in Toronto. Over the past 30 years there have been over 40 \"Bally\" stores operating in Canada. In addition, \"Bally\" products are sold through major department stores and other retail outlets.",
    "[3]\nTotal sales of Bally Canada Inc. for the period 1975 to 1984, were in excess of 200 million dollars ($200,000,000). Although footwear and related products account for the major portion of sales, \"Bally\" labelled products also include clothing, accessories and personal care products. The kinds of clothing, accessories and personal care products which are sold at any given time in association with the trademark \"Bally\", varies depending on fashion trends, customer demand and market conditions. Recent consumer preferences for well-known brand or \"designer\" labels has resulted in clothing and nonshoe products assuming a greater proportion of sales of \"Bally\" products in Canada.",
    "[4]\nOn September 24, 1984, the respondent filed an application (Serial No. 528,890) to register the trademark \"Wallys\" for use in association with a variety of clothing items, specifically jeans, pants, jackets and shirts for men and women. The trademark had been used in Canada since September 1, 1984. An abstract of this application appeared in the February 6, 1985 edition of the\nTrade Marks Journal\n.",
    "[5]\nOn March 18, 1985, the appellant filed a statement of opposition pursuant to paragraphs 38(2)(b), (c) and (d) of the\nAct\n, in which it alleged that the trademark \"Wallys\" was not registrable in so far as it was confusing with their registered trademark \"Bally\". It was also alleged that the proposed mark was not \"distinctive\" because it's use in association with clothing could lead to the inference that the goods emanated from the same source, and that the respondent was not \"a person entitled to its registration\" in view of the registration and prior use of the trademark \"Bally\".",
    "[6]\nBoth parties submitted written representations to the Trademarks Opposition Board and an oral hearing was held at which both parties were represented. On December 22, 1989, a decision was rendered rejecting the appellant's opposition pursuant to s. 38(8) of the\nAct\n. In its appeal before this court, the appellant argued that the Registrar was in error:\n1. in finding that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the trademark \"Bally\" and the trademark \"Wallys\";\n2. in not finding that the use of the parties respective trademarks in the same area would likely lead to the inference that the wares associated with the respective trademarks emanate from a common source;\n3. in not concluding that the appellant's trademark \"Bally\" is entitled to an extended scope of protection;\n4. in stating that the Board is entitled to have regard to matters arising after the date of opposition;\n5. in considering evidence establishing lack of actual confusion;\n6. in relying on no evidence of a change in circumstances involving the channels of trade for the wares of the respective parties, particularly subsequent to the filing of the statement of opposition;\n7. in finding that the trademarks \"Wallys\" was not confusing with the appellant's trademark \"Bally\" because of differences in sound and appearance between the respective marks;\n8. in not considering \"lack of distinctiveness\" as a ground of opposition; and\n9. in concluding that the applicant (respondent herein) had discharged the burden upon it.",
    "[7]\nAt the outset I should note that this court has consistently said that a decision of the Registrar as to whether two marks are confusing is to be given great weight and not to be lightly set aside, (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 199-200). However, where the court has the benefit of considering evidence not before the Registrar, the discretion of the court will be totally unfettered by the previous decision of the Registrar and, in essence, the appeal functions as a trial de novo, (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 7). In this regard, the appellant introduced new evidence in the form of five affidavits, in support of this appeal.",
    "[8]\nThe main grounds of opposition and the main grounds for the purpose of this appeal, involve consideration of the likelihood of confusion of the respondent's trademark \"Wallys\" with the appellant's trademark \"Bally\" or \"Ballys And Design\".",
    "[9]\nThe issue of confusion is a question of fact to be determined on the merits of each case. The test is one of the impression having regard to the average consumer with imperfect recollection. The onus of showing that confusion is unlikely rests with the person seeking to register a trademark and this onus does not change, even in the proceedings before me; (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F. Ct.)). The appellant is of the view that the respondent has failed to discharge this burden.",
    "[10]\nThe provisions of the\nTrade Marks Act\nwhich are relevant in this appeal are as follows:\n\"6(1) For the purposes of this Act, a trademark or tradename is confusing with another trademark or tradename if the use of the first mentioned trademark or tradename would cause confusion with the last mentioned trademark or tradename in the manner and circumstances described in this section.\n\"6(2) The use of a trademark causes confusion with another trademark if the use of both trademarks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with those trademarks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or services are of the same general class.\n\"6(5) In determining whether trademarks or tradenames are confusing, the court or the Registrar; as the case may be shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including\n(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks or tradenames and the extent to which they have become known;\n(b) the length of time the trademarks or tradenames have been in use;\n(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;\n(d) the nature of the trade; and\n(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or tradenames in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them\n\"12(1) Subject to s. 13, a trademark is registerable if it is not\n. . . . .\n(d) confusing with a registered mark;\n\"12(2) 'confusing', when applied as an adjective to a trademark or tradename, means a trademark or tradename the use of which would cause confusion in the manner and circumstances described in s. 6.\"",
    "[11]\nSection 6, subss. (1) and (2), begs the question of whether two marks are confusing, s. 6(5) provides a focus for this enquiry. As was pointed out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the criteria set out in s. 6(5) are not exhaustive. All the surrounding circumstances have to be considered. Furthermore, it is not necessary that \"all the circumstances\" exist, or to an equal degree, some circumstances will carry far more, or less, weight than others:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appropriate to review the evidence in light of the requirements of s. 6, and in particular, s. 6(5) of the\nAct\n.",
    "[12] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[13]\nSection 6(5)(a) requires consideration of the \"inherent distinctiveness\" of the trademarks and \"the extent to which they have become known\". In his reasons, the Registrar concludes that both trademarks were \"inherently distinctive\" as applied to their respective wares, but he went on to add that he was not prepared to conclude that the trademark \"Bally\" had become known to any measurable extent in association with items of clothing.",
    "[14]\nI have my doubts that these marks are \"inherently distinctive\". I do agree with counsel that because of lengthy and extensive use, the trademark \"Bally\" has become well known or famous in Canada and as result, is entitled to broader protection. Therefore, the fact that the trademark is less known in association with clothing becomes less significant.",
    "[15]\nThere is no question that with regard to s. 6(5)(b), \"length of time the trademarks have been in use\", this factor clearly weighs in the appellant's favour. The trademark \"Bally\" has been used in Canada since the early 1920's, and specifically, in association with jackets, ties, coats and other articles of clothing, since 1982. The respondent, on the other hand, can only demonstrate use of his mark since September 1984.",
    "[16]\nHaving regard to the \"nature of the wares\", the Registrar at page 3 of his reasons concludes:\n\"The applicant's wares differ from the opponent's shoes, shoe care products, handbags and the like. On the other hand, the opponent's jacket, shirts, pants and jeans are identical to the wares covered in the applicant's application. Additionally, the opponent's registered trademark 'Bally', covers jackets and shirts amongst other articles of clothing which overlap with the wares covered in the applicant's application. However, it is noted that it is in respect of footwear, handbags and shoe care products that the opponent has established a reputation in Canada in respect of its 'Bally' trademark.\"",
    "[17]\nIn order to show confusion, it is not necessary to prove use with regard to identical wares;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 32 N.R. 608. I agree with the Registrar's conclusion with regards to the nature of the wares and the likelihood of confusion, but for different reasons.",
    "[18]\nIn this regard, I refer to the evidence filed in support of this appeal, specifically the affidavit of Elizabeth Bryson dated March 8, 1990. This affidavit attempts to explain the absence of actual confusion between the two marks on the grounds that \"there is some doubt as to where the respondent's goods are sold\". A survey of several stores in major Toronto shopping malls indicated that while the sales staff were familiar with the trademark \"Bally\", they had never even heard of the brand name \"Wallys\". This indicates two things to me, that the wares are dissimilar and that they are sold in dissimilar establishments and that therefore the likelihood of the two marks being confused is diminished. I am aware that the \"Bally\" label is \"a designer label\" and their product line has become associated with high quality and price. Expensive items are likely to be more carefully scrutinized by prospective purchasers than less expensive ones, thereby lessening the risk of confusion;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Furthermore, in assessing the likelihood of confusion, while it is not necessary to prove that the wares are sold in the same places, the fact that they are sold in dissimilar establishments is a factor that would decrease the risk of confusion;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).",
    "[19]\nHaving regard to s. 6(5)(d), the \"nature of the trade\", there is definitely a risk of confusion where there is an overlap in common fields of activity. This risk is lessened when one party sells at the \"high end\" of the trade, and the other sells more at the \"low end\" of the trade;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  resemblance\" between the two trademarks, the Registrar concluded:\n\"As to the degree of resemblance between the trademarks at issue, I consider there to be no similarity in ideas suggested by the trademark 'Wallys' and 'Bally' while there does appear to be at least some similarity in sounding and a somewhat greater degree of similarity in appearance between the trademarks 'Wallys' and 'Bally'.\"",
    "[20] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[21]\nAffidavits filed in support of this appeal, from two linguistic experts both concluded that the two words, as spoken would be similar, distinguished only by their initial consonant. It was admitted that there is a great degree of resemblance in appearance. While this new evidence does establish resemblance in appearance and sound, I do not think it is, by itself, determinative of the issue of confusion.",
    "[22]\nHaving considered those factors specifically enumerated in s. 6(5)(a), regard must then be had to the \"surrounding circumstances\". The Registrar had before him evidence filed on behalf of the respondent (applicant), which established concurrent use of both trademarks with no instances of actual confusion. Counsel for the appellant argued that this affidavit evidence was inadmissible in that the material date for assessing the issue of confusion\nis as of the date of opposition, i.e., March 18, 1985\n(emphasis added) and this evidence was adduced after this date.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Registrar who cited in his reasons at page 6, the following passage from\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  since the three-year period referred to, i.e., 1979-82, is\nsubsequent to the material date for considering the question of confusion\n, i.e., June 8, 1978, this evidence is inadmissible. I do not accept this submission. Surely, evidence as to whether or not concurrent use of the marks during the period 1979-82 resulted in actual confusion is relevant to the question of the likelihood of confusion between the marks on June 8, 1978. The fact that the evidence relates to a period after the material date may well affect the weight which should be given to it (especially if circumstances are shown to have significantly changed since that date); however, it would not render it inadmissible.\" (Emphasis added)",
    "[23]\nThis passage ignores the question as to \"what is the material date\" for considering the question of confusion under ss. 12(1)(d) and 38(2)(b) of the\nAct\n? The decisions emanating from the courts are contradictory.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.), Cattanach, J., wrote at pages 231-232:\n\"Under s. 21(1)(d) a trademark is not registrable if it is confusing with a registered trademark. There is nothing in the\nTrade Marks Act\nto indicate that this refers to the situation at the time of filing of the application. Section 12(1)(d) speaks as of the present and since the appellant's registered trademarks were amended to include 'inks' in the interval between the filing of the respondent's application and the disposition of the appellant's opposition thereto by the Registrar on January 5, 1969, it is the situation at that later date which prevails.\"",
    "[24]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 126 (F.C.A.), the appellant opposed the application for registration on the grounds that the trademark was \"not distinctive\" pursuant to s. 38(2)(d). Thurlow, J. (as he then was), wrote at page 130:\n\"On the wording of s. 37(2)(d), the material time for this purpose appears to me to be the date of the filing of the opposition but on the facts of the present case, as I view them, the same result would ensue whether that or the time of the filing of the application is taken as the material time.\"",
    "[25]\nTwelve years after deciding the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra, Cattanach, J., admits that he made an error in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case and adopted a different position in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It appears that in this judgment Cattanach, J., may have extended the statement of Thurlow, J. (which applied only to s. 38(2)(d), \"that the trademark is not distinctive\"), to situations not discussed by Thurlow, J., specifically, that the trademark \"was not registrable\" pursuant to s. 38(2)(b) as was the situation in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra.",
    "[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 29 (F.C.A.), a decision reached shortly after the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Heald, J., wrote at page 35:\n\"Dealing now with s. 6(5)(e), the Registrar declines to find that the confusion test set out in s. 6(2) has been met largely on the basis that: (a) the appellant had not established lengthy and extensive prior use and (b) the parties were not engaged in the performance of services in the same general class.\n\"In my opinion, the Registrar was wrong on both counts. He should have considered the situation as of 1977 when he was disposing of the appellant's opposition to registration and not as it was at the date of filing of the application, 1972: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 231 and 232.\"",
    "[27]\nI am bound by the stare decisis principle and decision of the Court of Appeal in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case must be considered as stating the law as it now stands, that is, that the determining date under s. 12(1)(d) and s. 38(2)(b), is the time of disposing of the opposition to registration. Accordingly, the Registrar was not in error in considering evidence of lack of actual confusion. Furthermore, he noted that there had been no change in circumstances involving sales by the parties of their wares in association with their respective trademarks subsequent to the date of filing the opposition.",
    "[28]\nCounsel for the appellant argued before me that the practical effect of the Registrar's decision to accept this evidence shifted the onus on him, requiring him to prove that confusion had in fact, occurred. Respectfully, I find nothing in the written reasons of the Registrar indicating that the onus was placed on the shoulders of the appellant. It was open to the appellant at any time, to introduce evidence of instances of actual confusion or evidence explaining why actual confusion had not occurred.",
    "[29]\nHaving due regard to all the prescribed factors of s. 6(5) and of the surrounding circumstances, I am of the view that the Registrar was correct in concluding that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the trademarks \"Wallys\" and \"Bally\". I am not convinced that, even if the wares of the respective parties were sold in the same area, that confusion would result.",
    "[30]\nWith regards to the appellant's ground of opposition based on s. 38(2)(d), that the trademark is not distinctive, I find that this argument must fail. Section 2 of the\nAct\nreads:\n\"'distinctive', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others\nor is adapted so to distinguish them\n.\" (Emphasis added)",
    "[31]\nIn concluding that the marks are not confusing, it necessarily follows that the goods sold by the respondent under the trademark \"Wallys\" can be distinguished from the wares of the appellant.",
    "[32]\nOne final note, this appeal was filed February 21, 1990. It was the respondent who unilaterally applied for a time and place of hearing of this matter pursuant to rules 483(5) and 487 of the\nFederal Court Act\n. Subsequently, by letter dated November 19, 1991, the Administrator of the court was advised by the solicitor for the respondent that the respondent would not be appearing or be represented at the hearing of this matter. In oral argument counsel for the appellant commented on the respondent's absence and referred me to the case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , wherein Cattanach, J., albeit in obiter, says at page 5:\n\"The logical conclusion which follows from the respondent's decision not to be represented at the hearing of the appeal is that it attaches no importance or significance to the trademark which it proposed to use in association with its product and that it lost or foregone its interest in the mark and must have concluded that it is not worthy of the expense and effort of attempting to support its validity.\"\nThese comments have no bearing on the outcome of this case. I would however like to refer to what my learned colleague had to say at pages 4 and 5 of his reasons:\n\"It is incumbent upon the appellant to establish that the Registrar was in error in deciding as he did. That places the judge in the invidious position of ensuring that counsel for the appellant does so without the advantage of representations by counsel for the respondent. The judge is therefore obliged to raise matters favourable to the respondent and unfavourable to the appellant requiring counsel for the appellant to meet the matters so raised by the judge, as is the duty of the judge to do so. To place the judge in the position in which he is required to do this is almost tantamount to making him counsel for the respondent and that is why I have termed the position into which I was forced by the respondent's decision not to be represented as 'invidious'.\"",
    "[33]\nThis action is dismissed. As counsel for the respondent did not appear before me and make submissions as to costs, there will be no order as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\nEditor: Reginald W. Curtis/blk\n[End of document]"

The trademark \"Bally\" has been used in Canada since the early 1920's, and specifically, in association with jackets, ties, coats and other articles of clothing, since 1982.

Furthermore, in assessing the likelihood of confusion, while it is not necessary to prove that the wares are sold in the same places, the fact that they are sold in dissimilar establishments is a factor that would decrease the risk of confusion;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).\n[19]\nHaving regard to s. 6(5)(d), the \"nature of the trade\", there is definitely a risk of confusion where there is an overlap in common fields of activity. This risk is lessened when one party sells at the \"high end\" of the trade, and the other sells more at the \"low end\" of the trade;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  resemblance\" between the two trademarks, the Registrar concluded:\n\"As to the degree of resemblance between the trademarks at issue, I consider there to be no similarity in ideas suggested by the trademark 'Wallys' and 'Bally' while there does appear to be at least some similarity in sounding and a somewhat greater degree of similarity in appearance between the trademarks 'Wallys' and 'Bally'.\"\n[21]\nAffidavits filed in support of this appeal, from two linguistic experts both concluded that the two words, as spoken would be similar, distinguished only by their initial consonant. It was admitted that there is a great degree of resemblance in appearance. While this new evidence does establish resemblance in appearance and sound, I do not think it is, by itself, determinative of the issue of confusion.\n[22]\nHaving considered those factors specifically enumerated in s. 6(5)(a), regard must then be had to the \"surrounding circumstances\". The Registrar had before him evidence filed on behalf of the respondent (applicant), which established concurrent use of both trademarks with no instances of actual confusion. Counsel for the appellant argued that this affidavit evidence was inadmissible in that the material date for assessing the issue of confusion\nis as of the date of opposition, i.e., March 18, 1985\n(emphasis added) and this evidence was adduced after this date.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Registrar who cited in his reasons at page 6, the following passage from\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  since the three-year period referred to, i.e., 1979-82, is\nsubsequent to the material date for considering the question of confusion\n, i.e., June 8, 1978, this evidence is inadmissible. I do not accept this submission. Surely, evidence as to whether or not concurrent use of the marks during the period 1979-82 resulted in actual confusion is relevant to the question of the likelihood of confusion between the marks on June 8, 1978. The fact that the evidence relates to a period after the material date may well affect the weight which should be given to it (especially if circumstances are shown to have significantly changed since that date); however, it would not render it inadmissible.\" (Emphasis added)\n[23]\nThis passage ignores the question as to \"what is the material date\" for considering the question of confusion under ss. 12(1)(d) and 38(2)(b) of the\nAct\n? The decisions emanating from the courts are contradictory.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.), Cattanach, J., wrote at pages 231-232:\n\"Under s. 21(1)(d) a trademark is not registrable if it is confusing with a registered trademark. There is nothing in the\nTrade Marks Act\nto indicate that this refers to the situation at the time of filing of the application. Section 12(1)(d) speaks as of the present and since the appellant's registered trademarks were amended to include 'inks' in the interval between the filing of the respondent's application and the disposition of the appellant's opposition thereto by the Registrar on January 5, 1969, it is the situation at that later date which prevails.\"\n[24]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 126 (F.C.A.), the appellant opposed the application for registration on the grounds that the trademark was \"not distinctive\" pursuant to s. 38(2)(d). Thurlow, J. (as he then was), wrote at page 130:\n\"On the wording of s. 37(2)(d), the material time for this purpose appears to me to be the date of the filing of the opposition but on the facts of the present case, as I view them, the same result would ensue whether that or the time of the filing of the application is taken as the material time.\"\n[25]\nTwelve years after deciding the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra, Cattanach, J., admits that he made an error in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case and adopted a different position in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It appears that in this judgment Cattanach, J., may have extended the statement of Thurlow, J. (which applied only to s. 38(2)(d), \"that the trademark is not distinctive\"), to situations not discussed by Thurlow, J., specifically, that the trademark \"was not registrable\" pursuant to s. 38(2)(b) as was the situation in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra.\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 29 (F.C.A.), a decision reached shortly after the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Heald, J., wrote at page 35:\n\"Dealing now with s. 6(5)(e), the Registrar declines to find that the confusion test set out in s. 6(2) has been met largely on the basis that: (a) the appellant had not established lengthy and extensive prior use and (b) the parties were not engaged in the performance of services in the same general class.\n\"In my opinion, the Registrar was wrong on both counts. He should have considered the situation as of 1977 when he was disposing of the appellant's opposition to registration and not as it was at the date of filing of the application, 1972: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 231 and 232.\"\n[27]\nI am bound by the stare decisis principle and decision of the Court of Appeal in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case must be considered as stating the law as it now stands, that is, that the determining date under s. 12(1)(d) and s. 38(2)(b), is the time of disposing of the opposition to registration. Accordingly, the Registrar was not in error in considering evidence of lack of actual confusion. Furthermore, he noted that there had been no change in circumstances involving sales by the parties of their wares in association with their respective trademarks subsequent to the date of filing the opposition.\n[28]\nCounsel for the appellant argued before me that the practical effect of the Registrar's decision to accept this evidence shifted the onus on him, requiring him to prove that confusion had in fact, occurred. Respectfully, I find nothing in the written reasons of the Registrar indicating that the onus was placed on the shoulders of the appellant. It was open to the appellant at any time, to introduce evidence of instances of actual confusion or evidence explaining why actual confusion had not occurred.\n[29]\nHaving due regard to all the prescribed factors of s. 6(5) and of the surrounding circumstances, I am of the view that the Registrar was correct in concluding that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the trademarks \"Wallys\" and \"Bally\". I am not convinced that, even if the wares of the respective parties were sold in the same area, that confusion would result.\n[30]\nWith regards to the appellant's ground of opposition based on s. 38(2)(d), that the trademark is not distinctive, I find that this argument must fail. Section 2 of the\nAct\nreads:\n\"'distinctive', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others\nor is adapted so to distinguish them\n.\" (Emphasis added)\n[31]\nIn concluding that the marks are not confusing, it necessarily follows that the goods sold by the respondent under the trademark \"Wallys\" can be distinguished from the wares of the appellant.\n[32]\nOne final note, this appeal was filed February 21, 1990. It was the respondent who unilaterally applied for a time and place of hearing of this matter pursuant to rules 483(5) and 487 of the\nFederal Court Act\n. Subsequently, by letter dated November 19, 1991, the Administrator of the court was advised by the solicitor for the respondent that the respondent would not be appearing or be represented at the hearing of this matter. In oral argument counsel for the appellant commented on the respondent's absence and referred me to the case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , wherein Cattanach, J., albeit in obiter, says at page 5:\n\"The logical conclusion which follows from the respondent's decision not to be represented at the hearing of the appeal is that it attaches no importance or significance to the trademark which it proposed to use in association with its product and that it lost or foregone its interest in the mark and must have concluded that it is not worthy of the expense and effort of attempting to support its validity.\"\nThese comments have no bearing on the outcome of this case. I would however like to refer to what my learned colleague had to say at pages 4 and 5 of his reasons:\n\"It is incumbent upon the appellant to establish that the Registrar was in error in deciding as he did. That places the judge in the invidious position of ensuring that counsel for the appellant does so without the advantage of representations by counsel for the respondent. The judge is therefore obliged to raise matters favourable to the respondent and unfavourable to the appellant requiring counsel for the appellant to meet the matters so raised by the judge, as is the duty of the judge to do so. To place the judge in the position in which he is required to do this is almost tantamount to making him counsel for the respondent and that is why I have termed the position into which I was forced by the respondent's decision not to be represented as 'invidious'.\"\n[33]\nThis action is dismissed.

  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nRouleau, J.\n: This is an appeal pursuant to s. 56 of the\nTrade Marks Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, from the decision of the Chairman of the Trademarks Opposition Board (hereinafter referred to as the Registrar of Trademarks), rejecting the appellant's opposition to the registration of the respondent's trademark \"Wallys\".\n\n[2]\nThe appellant is the registered owner of the trademark \"Bally\" which has been registered in Canada under registration Nos. TMDA16547, UCA50569, TMA285,315 and TMA285,783 for use in association with a wide variety of footwear, clothing and accessories. The first sales of \"Bally\" products in Canada occurred as early as the 1920's. Since 1951, \"Bally\" products have been distributed by a Canadian subsidiary, now known as Bally Canada Inc., with head offices in Toronto. Over the past 30 years there have been over 40 \"Bally\" stores operating in Canada. In addition, \"Bally\" products are sold through major department stores and other retail outlets.\n\n[3]\nTotal sales of Bally Canada Inc. for the period 1975 to 1984, were in excess of 200 million dollars ($200,000,000). Although footwear and related products account for the major portion of sales, \"Bally\" labelled products also include clothing, accessories and personal care products. The kinds of clothing, accessories and personal care products which are sold at any given time in association with the trademark \"Bally\", varies depending on fashion trends, customer demand and market conditions. Recent consumer preferences for well-known brand or \"designer\" labels has resulted in clothing and nonshoe products assuming a greater proportion of sales of \"Bally\" products in Canada.\n\n[4]\nOn September 24, 1984, the respondent filed an application (Serial No. 528,890) to register the trademark \"Wallys\" for use in association with a variety of clothing items, specifically jeans, pants, jackets and shirts for men and women. The trademark had been used in Canada since September 1, 1984. An abstract of this application appeared in the February 6, 1985 edition of the\nTrade Marks Journal\n.\n\n[5]\nOn March 18, 1985, the appellant filed a statement of opposition pursuant to paragraphs 38(2)(b), (c) and (d) of the\nAct\n, in which it alleged that the trademark \"Wallys\" was not registrable in so far as it was confusing with their registered trademark \"Bally\". It was also alleged that the proposed mark was not \"distinctive\" because it's use in association with clothing could lead to the inference that the goods emanated from the same source, and that the respondent was not \"a person entitled to its registration\" in view of the registration and prior use of the trademark \"Bally\".\n\n[6]\nBoth parties submitted written representations to the Trademarks Opposition Board and an oral hearing was held at which both parties were represented. On December 22, 1989, a decision was rendered rejecting the appellant's opposition pursuant to s. 38(8) of the\nAct\n. In its appeal before this court, the appellant argued that the Registrar was in error:\n1. in finding that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the trademark \"Bally\" and the trademark \"Wallys\";\n2. in not finding that the use of the parties respective trademarks in the same area would likely lead to the inference that the wares associated with the respective trademarks emanate from a common source;\n3. in not concluding that the appellant's trademark \"Bally\" is entitled to an extended scope of protection;\n4. in stating that the Board is entitled to have regard to matters arising after the date of opposition;\n5. in considering evidence establishing lack of actual confusion;\n6. in relying on no evidence of a change in circumstances involving the channels of trade for the wares of the respective parties, particularly subsequent to the filing of the statement of opposition;\n7. in finding that the trademarks \"Wallys\" was not confusing with the appellant's trademark \"Bally\" because of differences in sound and appearance between the respective marks;\n8. in not considering \"lack of distinctiveness\" as a ground of opposition; and\n9. in concluding that the applicant (respondent herein) had discharged the burden upon it.\n\n[7]\nAt the outset I should note that this court has consistently said that a decision of the Registrar as to whether two marks are confusing is to be given great weight and not to be lightly set aside, (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 199-200). However, where the court has the benefit of considering evidence not before the Registrar, the discretion of the court will be totally unfettered by the previous decision of the Registrar and, in essence, the appeal functions as a trial de novo, (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 7). In this regard, the appellant introduced new evidence in the form of five affidavits, in support of this appeal.\n\n[8]\nThe main grounds of opposition and the main grounds for the purpose of this appeal, involve consideration of the likelihood of confusion of the respondent's trademark \"Wallys\" with the appellant's trademark \"Bally\" or \"Ballys And Design\".\n\n[9]\nThe issue of confusion is a question of fact to be determined on the merits of each case. The test is one of the impression having regard to the average consumer with imperfect recollection. The onus of showing that confusion is unlikely rests with the person seeking to register a trademark and this onus does not change, even in the proceedings before me; (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F. Ct.)). The appellant is of the view that the respondent has failed to discharge this burden.\n\n[10]\nThe provisions of the\nTrade Marks Act\nwhich are relevant in this appeal are as follows:\n\"6(1) For the purposes of this Act, a trademark or tradename is confusing with another trademark or tradename if the use of the first mentioned trademark or tradename would cause confusion with the last mentioned trademark or tradename in the manner and circumstances described in this section.\n\"6(2) The use of a trademark causes confusion with another trademark if the use of both trademarks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with those trademarks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or services are of the same general class.\n\"6(5) In determining whether trademarks or tradenames are confusing, the court or the Registrar; as the case may be shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including\n(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks or tradenames and the extent to which they have become known;\n(b) the length of time the trademarks or tradenames have been in use;\n(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;\n(d) the nature of the trade; and\n(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or tradenames in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them\n\"12(1) Subject to s. 13, a trademark is registerable if it is not\n. . . . .\n(d) confusing with a registered mark;\n\"12(2) 'confusing', when applied as an adjective to a trademark or tradename, means a trademark or tradename the use of which would cause confusion in the manner and circumstances described in s. 6.\"\n\n[11]\nSection 6, subss. (1) and (2), begs the question of whether two marks are confusing, s. 6(5) provides a focus for this enquiry. As was pointed out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the criteria set out in s. 6(5) are not exhaustive. All the surrounding circumstances have to be considered. Furthermore, it is not necessary that \"all the circumstances\" exist, or to an equal degree, some circumstances will carry far more, or less, weight than others:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appropriate to review the evidence in light of the requirements of s. 6, and in particular, s. 6(5) of the\nAct\n.\n\n[12] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[13]\nSection 6(5)(a) requires consideration of the \"inherent distinctiveness\" of the trademarks and \"the extent to which they have become known\". In his reasons, the Registrar concludes that both trademarks were \"inherently distinctive\" as applied to their respective wares, but he went on to add that he was not prepared to conclude that the trademark \"Bally\" had become known to any measurable extent in association with items of clothing.\n\n[14]\nI have my doubts that these marks are \"inherently distinctive\". I do agree with counsel that because of lengthy and extensive use, the trademark \"Bally\" has become well known or famous in Canada and as result, is entitled to broader protection. Therefore, the fact that the trademark is less known in association with clothing becomes less significant.\n\n[15]\nThere is no question that with regard to s. 6(5)(b), \"length of time the trademarks have been in use\", this factor clearly weighs in the appellant's favour. The trademark \"Bally\" has been used in Canada since the early 1920's, and specifically, in association with jackets, ties, coats and other articles of clothing, since 1982. The respondent, on the other hand, can only demonstrate use of his mark since September 1984.\n\n[16]\nHaving regard to the \"nature of the wares\", the Registrar at page 3 of his reasons concludes:\n\"The applicant's wares differ from the opponent's shoes, shoe care products, handbags and the like. On the other hand, the opponent's jacket, shirts, pants and jeans are identical to the wares covered in the applicant's application. Additionally, the opponent's registered trademark 'Bally', covers jackets and shirts amongst other articles of clothing which overlap with the wares covered in the applicant's application. However, it is noted that it is in respect of footwear, handbags and shoe care products that the opponent has established a reputation in Canada in respect of its 'Bally' trademark.\"\n\n[17]\nIn order to show confusion, it is not necessary to prove use with regard to identical wares;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 32 N.R. 608. I agree with the Registrar's conclusion with regards to the nature of the wares and the likelihood of confusion, but for different reasons.\n\n[18]\nIn this regard, I refer to the evidence filed in support of this appeal, specifically the affidavit of Elizabeth Bryson dated March 8, 1990. This affidavit attempts to explain the absence of actual confusion between the two marks on the grounds that \"there is some doubt as to where the respondent's goods are sold\". A survey of several stores in major Toronto shopping malls indicated that while the sales staff were familiar with the trademark \"Bally\", they had never even heard of the brand name \"Wallys\". This indicates two things to me, that the wares are dissimilar and that they are sold in dissimilar establishments and that therefore the likelihood of the two marks being confused is diminished. I am aware that the \"Bally\" label is \"a designer label\" and their product line has become associated with high quality and price. Expensive items are likely to be more carefully scrutinized by prospective purchasers than less expensive ones, thereby lessening the risk of confusion;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Furthermore, in assessing the likelihood of confusion, while it is not necessary to prove that the wares are sold in the same places, the fact that they are sold in dissimilar establishments is a factor that would decrease the risk of confusion;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).\n\n[19]\nHaving regard to s. 6(5)(d), the \"nature of the trade\", there is definitely a risk of confusion where there is an overlap in common fields of activity. This risk is lessened when one party sells at the \"high end\" of the trade, and the other sells more at the \"low end\" of the trade;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  resemblance\" between the two trademarks, the Registrar concluded:\n\"As to the degree of resemblance between the trademarks at issue, I consider there to be no similarity in ideas suggested by the trademark 'Wallys' and 'Bally' while there does appear to be at least some similarity in sounding and a somewhat greater degree of similarity in appearance between the trademarks 'Wallys' and 'Bally'.\"\n\n[20] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[21]\nAffidavits filed in support of this appeal, from two linguistic experts both concluded that the two words, as spoken would be similar, distinguished only by their initial consonant. It was admitted that there is a great degree of resemblance in appearance. While this new evidence does establish resemblance in appearance and sound, I do not think it is, by itself, determinative of the issue of confusion.\n\n[22]\nHaving considered those factors specifically enumerated in s. 6(5)(a), regard must then be had to the \"surrounding circumstances\". The Registrar had before him evidence filed on behalf of the respondent (applicant), which established concurrent use of both trademarks with no instances of actual confusion. Counsel for the appellant argued that this affidavit evidence was inadmissible in that the material date for assessing the issue of confusion\nis as of the date of opposition, i.e., March 18, 1985\n(emphasis added) and this evidence was adduced after this date.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Registrar who cited in his reasons at page 6, the following passage from\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  since the three-year period referred to, i.e., 1979-82, is\nsubsequent to the material date for considering the question of confusion\n, i.e., June 8, 1978, this evidence is inadmissible. I do not accept this submission. Surely, evidence as to whether or not concurrent use of the marks during the period 1979-82 resulted in actual confusion is relevant to the question of the likelihood of confusion between the marks on June 8, 1978. The fact that the evidence relates to a period after the material date may well affect the weight which should be given to it (especially if circumstances are shown to have significantly changed since that date); however, it would not render it inadmissible.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n[23]\nThis passage ignores the question as to \"what is the material date\" for considering the question of confusion under ss. 12(1)(d) and 38(2)(b) of the\nAct\n? The decisions emanating from the courts are contradictory.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.), Cattanach, J., wrote at pages 231-232:\n\"Under s. 21(1)(d) a trademark is not registrable if it is confusing with a registered trademark. There is nothing in the\nTrade Marks Act\nto indicate that this refers to the situation at the time of filing of the application. Section 12(1)(d) speaks as of the present and since the appellant's registered trademarks were amended to include 'inks' in the interval between the filing of the respondent's application and the disposition of the appellant's opposition thereto by the Registrar on January 5, 1969, it is the situation at that later date which prevails.\"\n\n[24]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 126 (F.C.A.), the appellant opposed the application for registration on the grounds that the trademark was \"not distinctive\" pursuant to s. 38(2)(d). Thurlow, J. (as he then was), wrote at page 130:\n\"On the wording of s. 37(2)(d), the material time for this purpose appears to me to be the date of the filing of the opposition but on the facts of the present case, as I view them, the same result would ensue whether that or the time of the filing of the application is taken as the material time.\"\n\n[25]\nTwelve years after deciding the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra, Cattanach, J., admits that he made an error in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case and adopted a different position in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It appears that in this judgment Cattanach, J., may have extended the statement of Thurlow, J. (which applied only to s. 38(2)(d), \"that the trademark is not distinctive\"), to situations not discussed by Thurlow, J., specifically, that the trademark \"was not registrable\" pursuant to s. 38(2)(b) as was the situation in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra.\n\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 29 (F.C.A.), a decision reached shortly after the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Heald, J., wrote at page 35:\n\"Dealing now with s. 6(5)(e), the Registrar declines to find that the confusion test set out in s. 6(2) has been met largely on the basis that: (a) the appellant had not established lengthy and extensive prior use and (b) the parties were not engaged in the performance of services in the same general class.\n\"In my opinion, the Registrar was wrong on both counts.

      "A company (the appellant) owns the registered trademark \"Bally\" for footwear, clothing, and accessories, with sales in Canada dating back to the 1920s and a Canadian subsidiary established in 1951.",
      "The appellant's \"Bally\" products have been sold through numerous stores and major retailers in Canada, with sales exceeding $200 million between 1975 and 1984.",
      "A second party (the respondent) applied to register the trademark \"Wallys\" in September 1984 for use with clothing items (jeans, pants, jackets, shirts).",
      "The respondent had been using the \"Wallys\" trademark in Canada since September 1, 1984.",
      "The appellant opposed the registration of \"Wallys\" in March 1985, alleging it was confusingly similar to \"Bally\" and not distinctive.",
      "Both parties submitted written arguments and participated in an oral hearing before the Trademarks Opposition Board.",
      "The Trademarks Opposition Board rejected the appellant's opposition in December 1989.",
      "The appellant appealed the Board's decision, presenting new evidence in the form of affidavits.",
      "The core of the dispute concerns the potential for confusion between the trademarks \"Bally\" and \"Wallys\".",
      "Evidence was presented regarding the sales locations and consumer recognition of both trademarks.",
      "The respondent did not appear or submit arguments at the appeal hearing."

        "The trademark 'Wallys' is confusing with the registered trademark 'Bally'.",

        "The Registrar erred in considering evidence of a lack of actual confusion.",

        "The Registrar erred in finding 'Wallys' not confusing based on differences in sound and appearance.",
        "The Registrar erred in not considering 'lack of distinctiveness' as a ground of opposition.",
        "The respondent did not discharge the burden of proving the trademark was registrable.",
        "Evidence of concurrent use of the marks, and lack of actual confusion, should have been considered regarding the date of the opposition, not a later date.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether the trademark “Wallys” was confusingly similar to the appellant’s registered trademark “Bally.” The court affirmed the Registrar’s decision that no such confusion existed, giving significant weight to the Registrar’s initial finding.",
      "The court acknowledged the test for confusion is based on the impression created on the average consumer with imperfect recollection, and the onus is on the applicant (respondent) to demonstrate a lack of likelihood of confusion.",
      "The court found both marks were likely inherently distinctive, but emphasized the extensive use and reputation of “Bally” entitled it to broader protection, diminishing the significance of any lesser recognition in relation to clothing specifically.",
      "The court considered the factors outlined in Section 6(5) of the Trade Marks Act, including inherent distinctiveness, length of use, nature of the wares, nature of the trade, and resemblance in appearance or sound. It determined these factors, taken together, did not establish a likelihood of confusion.",
      "Regarding the ‘nature of the wares,’ the court agreed with the Registrar that while some overlap existed (clothing), “Bally” had a stronger reputation in footwear and related items, and the evidence suggested the goods were sold in different establishments, reducing the risk of confusion.",
      "The court addressed the admissibility of evidence regarding lack of actual confusion, finding that evidence of post-opposition use was relevant, despite differing case law, and that the Registrar did not improperly shift the onus of proof.",
      "The court clarified the ‘material date’ for assessing confusion, ultimately siding with Court of Appeal precedent establishing that the relevant time is when the opposition is disposed of, not the date of application or opposition filing.",
      "The court rejected the argument that “Wallys” lacked distinctiveness, reasoning that the finding of no confusion implied the goods could be distinguished, satisfying the statutory definition of ‘distinctive.’",
      "The court noted the respondent’s decision not to participate in the appeal, but explicitly stated this had no bearing on the outcome, and reiterated the court’s duty to ensure a fair hearing despite the respondent’s absence."
