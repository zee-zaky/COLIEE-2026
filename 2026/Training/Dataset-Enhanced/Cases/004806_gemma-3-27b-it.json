    "[1]\nDawson, J.\n: Emine Eler is a citizen of Turkey who sought refugee protection.

    "[3]\nCritical to the Board's conclusion was its reliance upon \"The Law for the Protection of the Family in Turkey\" which came into force in 1998.

The judge must immediately grant a protection order on receipt of the application; it is not a request to prosecute the offender but a request for the protection of the spouse or woman. It requires the alleged perpetrator of violence to leave the home and to comply with other requirements of the order, such as not approaching the victim, or face imprisonment. It gives the police the right to confiscate the alleged perpetrator's weapons.\"",
    "[4]\nThe legislation was not in evidence before the Board. Instead, the Board relied upon a description of the legislation contained in an Amnesty International report.

      "The court applied the standard of reasonableness review, requiring justification, transparency, and intelligibility in the Board’s decision-making process, and a defensible outcome based on facts and law.",
      "The court determined the Board’s reasoning failed the justification component of reasonableness because it relied on evidence (the Amnesty International report) that indicated the relevant legislation did not apply to Ms. Eler’s circumstances.",
      "Because the Board relied on legislation it found *could not* protect the claimant, the court concluded the decision regarding the availability of state protection was not reasonably justified and therefore unreasonable.",
