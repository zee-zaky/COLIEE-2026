    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 208)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nMosley, J.\nFebruary 13, 2012.\nCounsel:\nMalvin J. Harding, for the applicant;\nEdward Burnet, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nMalvin J. Harding, Surrey, British Columbia, for the applicant;\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nMosley, J.\n: The applicant, Mr. Ekomobong Akpan Obot, is a 25 year old graduate student from Nigeria. On three occasions in 2010 and 2011 he requested a visa to continue his education in Canada. Each request was refused on the ground that he would be unlikely to return to Nigeria on the completion of his studies.",
    "[2]\nMr. Obot applies for judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 of the decision made on May 5, 2011, by an Immigration Officer of the Canadian Embassy in Vienna. For the reasons that follow, the application is granted.\nBACKGROUND\n:",
    "[3]\nMr. Obot is from the delta region of southern Nigeria. His parents, siblings and extended family remain there. His mother is a qualified nurse employed at a university. A maternal uncle is a retired Rear Admiral of the Nigerian Navy. His father had a long career in government and is active in politics and business.",
    "[4]\nThe record indicates that Mr. Obot and his parents place a great emphasis on education. The father obtained undergraduate and graduate degrees at an American university. After working for a few years in the United States he returned to Nigeria with his family. Following high school, the applicant was sent to study in Europe. From 2006 to 2009 he attended the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest and obtained a B.Sc. in International Business and Economics. He then attended the International Business School in Budapest, affiliated with the Oxford Brookes University in the United Kingdom, and obtained a M.Sc. in Human Resources and Management in 2011.",
    "[5]\nDuring his studies abroad, the applicant did not return to Nigeria. During one summer break he visited relatives in the United Kingdom. He has not worked, other than one summer where he served as a volunteer in the United Kingdom. His parents have provided for his tuition and living costs.",
    "[6]\nThe applicant applied for and was admitted to a pre-Masters of Business Administration programme at Trinity Western University in British Columbia. This is described by the university as an upgrade programme to ensure that candidates have the basic language and other skills required to complete an MBA.",
    "[7]\nMr. Obot has acknowledged that his application for a United Kingdom visitor's visa was initially refused. It was granted on reconsideration. There is no evidence that the applicant abused the terms of that visa by overstaying. His application for a study visa in the United States was denied for reasons that are not part of the record. In addition to the three formal applications for a Canadian study visa, the applicant has requested reconsideration on two occasions. He has not previously sought judicial review of the refusals.\nDECISION UNDER REVIEW\n:",
    "[8]\nThe decision letter dated May 6, 2011 indicates that the application was rejected because the officer did not believe the applicant would leave Canada at the end of his stay. The officer's notes included in the Certified Tribunal Record, read in part as follows:\nApplicant has completed studies in Romania and Hungary. He is not established in any of these countries, he has completed what he had to do and has no reasons to return there after a stay in Cda. As for his country of origin, applicant had not resided in Nigeria since 2006. He has no children, property or career to return to. Many supporting documents were provided by father who's involved in national politics party that won the last election in APR11. Review of the conditions in Nigeria show that the election results were contested by opposition which led to riots and deaths (500 according to Red Cross estimations). The country is clearly divided in two following the elections and instable [sic] at the moment. As a result of the lack of ties to Romania, Hungary or Nigeria and of the conditions in Nigeria at the moment, I'm not satisfied there is sufficient evidence the applicant will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for stay. Refusing this application.\nISSUES\n:",
    "[9]\nThe issues raised by this application are:\na. whether the exhibits attached to the applicant's second affidavit are admissible as they were not before the officer when the decision was made; and\nb. whether the officer's decision was reasonable.\nRELEVANT LEGISLATION\n:",
    "[10]\nParagraph 20(1)(b) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 states:\n20. (1) Every foreign national, other than a foreign national referred to in section 19, who seeks to enter or remain in Canada must establish,\n(\nb\n) to become a temporary resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\n20. (1) L'étranger non visé à l'article 19 qui cherche à entrer au Canada ou à y séjourner est tenu de prouver:\nb\n) pour devenir un résident temporaire, qu'il détient les visa ou autres documents requis par règlement et aura quitté le Canada à la fin de la période de séjour autorisée.",
    "[11]\nParagraph 216(1)(b) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 (hereafter the Regulations) reads:\n216. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), an officer shall issue a study permit to a foreign national if, following an examination, it is established that the foreign national\n(\nb\n) will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay under Division 2 of Part 9;\n216. (1) Sous réserve des paragraphes (2) et (3), l'agent délivre un permis d'études à l'étranger si, à l'issue d'un contrôle, les éléments suivants sont établis:\nb\n) il quittera le Canada à la fin de la période de séjour qui lui est applicable au titre de la section 2 de la partie 9;\nANALYSIS\n:\nStandard of Review",
    "[12]\nThe parties are agreed and I accept that an Immigration Officer's decision based on the belief that the applicant will not leave Canada at the end of his stay is a question of mixed fact and law. The standard of review is therefore reasonableness:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[13]\nAs the Supreme Court of Canada has recently instructed in\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a review of the adequacy of reasons does not invoke procedural fairness requiring the correctness standard; the Court may supplement the reasons by reference to the record; and deference should be accorded where the tribunal is alive to the question at issue and comes to a decision well within the range of acceptable outcomes.",
    "[14]\nA finding of reasonableness is based on the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process and whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nIs the new evidence admissible?",
    "[15]\nAs a preliminary matter, the respondent objected to the admission of the applicant's second affidavit in support of his reply to the respondent's memorandum of argument as it attaches as exhibits letters from the applicant's father and uncle intended to rebut the officer's statements regarding conditions in Nigeria. As these letters were not before the officer at the time the decision was made, they are presumptively inadmissible:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aff'd by 2009 FCA 124.",
    "[16]\nHowever, the Court may admit new evidence where it relates to procedural fairness and jurisdiction and upon consideration of the factors set out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[17]\nIn this instance, I am satisfied that the evidence should be admitted as it relates to a finding about conditions in Nigeria which was apparently made on extrinsic evidence and without inviting a response from the applicant. Those circumstances give rise to the consideration of whether procedural fairness was accorded the applicant.\nWas the officer's decision reasonable?",
    "[18]\nIt was open to the officer to take into consideration the facts that the applicant had not lived in Nigeria since 2006 and had not returned there for visits with his family during breaks from his studies in Europe. As stated by Justice de Montigny in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the fact that an applicant does not have a history of returning to her country of origin from trips abroad is a relevant consideration.",
    "[19]\nThe applicant and his father provided an explanation for why he had not returned home - that the family wanted him to concentrate on his studies without distractions. While that may appear unusual from a western developed world perspective, it may be a more common practice in West Africa. In any event, there is no indication in the record that the officer considered whether the explanation was reasonable or not.",
    "[20]\nWith regards to the applicant's ties to Nigeria, the officer's reasons are not transparent, justified and intelligible. The applicant is 25 years old and a student, it is thus normal for him to have \"no spouse, children or property\" in Nigeria or anywhere else. Furthermore the officer did not consider that all of the applicant's family lives in Nigeria and did not consider the strength of his ties to his family:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[21]\nThe officer's reasons do not disclose that she considered the fact that the applicant has no ties to Canada and no family in Canada. Unlike in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, he has travelled outside of his country and, thus far, has a record of returning to the countries in which he is temporarily resident while pursuing his studies. And he has encountered no difficulties with the authorities while living in those countries. It seems to me that this record cannot be used to support the inference that he does not intend to go back to Nigeria upon completion of his studies.",
    "[22]\nWith regards to conditions in Nigeria, there is nothing in the certified tribunal record to support the officer's statement that the country was split. The issue was not brought to the attention of the applicant and thus the applicant did not have the opportunity to make submissions on the matter. In fact, the consideration of Nigeria's current situation as a factor for denying a visa does not appear in the decision communicated to the applicant. The reasoning only appears in the officer's notes. The officer's decision must be based on the evidence:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47.",
    "[23]\nThe respondent contends that it was open to the officer to rely on her knowledge of conditions in Nigeria and cites\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in support. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice de Montigny accepted that an officer could consider evidence of general country conditions but found that the extraneous evidence was unsupported, undocumented and irrelevant. At paragraph 34 he stated: \"[o] versimplified generalizations cannot and should not form the basis of what must always be an individualized assessment based on the particular circumstances of each individual.\" In this case the officer fell into the trap of an oversimplified generalization and did not conduct an individualized assessment.",
    "[24]\nWhile I agree with the respondent that immigration officers become well versed in the conditions within the countries from which visa applications are made, this awareness does not constitute a form of \"judicial notice\" as was suggested in oral argument. To the extent that concept may apply to administrative decisions it would only arise where the facts are beyond dispute. Here, there is clearly a difference of opinion about the conditions in Nigeria and whether that would have a bearing on the applicant's future return to that country.",
    "[25]\nIn the result I find that the decision to deny the applicant a student visa was unreasonable and I will order that the matter be remitted for reconsideration by a different officer in accordance with these reasons.",
    "[26]\nNo serious questions of general importance were proposed by the parties and none will be certified.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[27]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application is granted and the matter is remitted for reconsideration by a different Immigration Officer in accordance with the reasons for judgment. No questions are certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> plaintiff, Mr. Ekomobong Alpan Obot, is a 25-year-old graduate student from Nigeria.

À trois occasions, en 2010 et 2011, il a demandé un visa pour lui permettre de poursuivre ses études au Canada. Ses demandes ont toutes été refusées au motif qu'il était improbable qu'il retourne au Nigéria à la fin de ses études.\n[2]\nM. Obot sollicite, en vertu de l'article 72 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, ch. 27, le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue le 5 mai 2011 par une agente de l'immigration à l'ambassade du Canada à Vienne. Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande est accueillie.\nLE CONTEXTE\n[3]\nM. Obot est de la région du delta du Niger, située dans le Sud du Nigéria et dans laquelle demeurent ses parents, ses frères et surs ainsi que sa famille étendue. Sa mère est une infirmière agréée employée dans une université. Un oncle maternel est un contre-amiral à la retraite de la marine nigériane. Son père a eu une longue carrière au sein du gouvernement et est actif en politique et dans les affaires.\n[4]\nLe dossier indique que M. Obot et ses parents accordent une grande importance aux études. Le père a obtenu des diplômes de premier cycle et d'études supérieures dans une université américaine. Après avoir travaillé pendant quelques années aux États-Unis, il est retourné au Nigéria avec sa famille. Après ses études secondaires, le demandeur a été envoyé en Europe pour étudier. De 2006 à 2009, il a fréquenté l'Académie des études économiques de Bucarest et a obtenu un B.Sc en commerce international et en économie. Il a ensuite fréquenté l'École de commerce international de Budapest, laquelle est affiliée à l'Université Oxford Brookes au Royaume-Uni, et a obtenu une maîtrise en ressources humaines et en gestion en 2011.\n[5]\nDurant ses études à l'étranger, le demandeur n'est pas rentré au Nigéria. Lors des vacances estivales, il visitait des parents au Royaume-Uni. Il n'a pas travaillé, sauf un été au cours duquel il a été bénévole dans ce pays. Ses parents ont payé ses frais d'études et ses frais de subsistance.\n[6]\nLe demandeur a fait une demande d'admission au programme de pré-maîtrise en administration des affaires à l'Université Trinity Western en Colombie-Britannique. Selon la description qu'en donne l'Université, il s'agit d'un programme d'études supérieures devant permettre aux candidats d'acquérir les habiletés requises pour mener à bien une maîtrise en administration des affaires, notamment les habiletés langagières.\n[7]\nM. Obot a reconnu que sa demande de visa de visiteur au Royaume-Uni a été d'abord refusée. Son visa lui a été accordé après un nouvel examen. Rien n'indique que le demandeur ait manqué aux conditions de ce visa en prolongeant indûment son séjour. Sa demande de visa d'étude aux États-Unis a été refusée pour des motifs qui ne sont pas au dossier. Outre les trois demandes officielles de visa d'étude au Canada, le demandeur a demandé deux réexamens. Hormis la décision qui nous occupe, aucune autre décision rejetant ses demandes de visa n'a à ce jour fait l'objet d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire.\nLA DÉCISION CONTRÔLÉE\n[8]\nLa lettre de décision datée du 6 mai 2011 indique que la demande a été rejetée parce que l'agente ne croyait pas que le demandeur quitterait le Canada à la fin de son séjour. Voici un extrait des notes de l'agente ayant été versées dans le dossier certifié du tribunal:\n[traduction]\nLe demandeur a terminé des études en Roumanie et en Hongrie. Il n'est établi dans aucun de ces deux pays, il a terminé ce qu'il devait y faire et n'a aucune raison d'y retourner après son séjour au Canada. Quant à son pays d'origine, le demandeur n'a pas résidé au Nigéria depuis 2006. Il n'a pas d'enfant, ni bien ni carrière susceptible de l'inciter à retourner dans son pays. Plusieurs documents d'appui ont été soumis par le père qui appartient au parti politique national qui a emporté la dernière élection le 11 avril. L'examen de la situation au Nigéria montre que les résultats des élections ont été contestés par l'opposition, ce qui a donné lieu à des émeutes et a causé des morts (550 selon les estimations de la Croix Rouge internationale). Le pays est à l'évidence divisé en deux depuis les élections et instable en ce moment. Étant donné l'absence de liens avec la Roumanie, la Hongrie ou le Nigéria et la situation au Nigéria en ce moment, je n'estime pas que la preuve permet de conclure que le demandeur quittera le Canada à la fin de la période autorisée pour son séjour. La demande est rejetée.\nLES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE\n[9]\nLa présente demande soulève les questions suivantes:\na. la question de savoir si les pièces jointes au deuxième affidavit du demandeur sont admissibles en preuve, bien que cette preuve n'ait pas été présentée à l'agente;\nb. la question de savoir si la décision de l'agente était raisonnable.\nLA LÉGISLATION PERTINENTE\n[10]\nL'alinéa 20(1)\nb\n) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001, c 27, est rédigé comme suit:\n20. (1) L'étranger non visé à l'article 19 qui cherche à entrer au Canada ou à y séjourner est tenu de prouver:\nb\n) pour devenir un résident temporaire, qu'il détient les visa ou autres documents requis par règlement et aura quitté le Canada à la fin de la période de séjour autorisée.\n20. (1) Every foreign national, other than a foreign national referred to in section 19, who seeks to enter or remain in Canada must establish,\n(\nb\n) to become a temporary resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\n[11]\nL'alinéa 216(1)\nb\n) de la\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nDORS/2002-227 (le Règlement), est rédigé comme suit:\n216. (1) Sous réserve des paragraphes (2) et (3), l'agent délivre un permis d'études à l'étranger si, à l'issue d'un contrôle, les éléments suivants sont établis:\nb\n) il quittera le Canada à la fin de la période de séjour qui lui est applicable au titre de la section 2 de la partie 9;\n216. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), an officer shall issue a study permit to a foreign national if, following an examination, it is established that the foreign national\n(\nb\n) will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay under Division 2 of Part 9;\nANALYSE\nLa norme de contrôle\n[12]\nLes parties conviennent et je suis d'accord que la décision d'un agent d'immigration fondée sur la croyance que le demandeur ne quittera pas le Canada à la fin de son séjour est une question mixte de fait et de droit. La norme de contrôle applicable est par conséquent celle de la raisonnabilité:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[13]\nComme la Cour suprême du Canada l'a indiqué récemment dans\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'examen de la suffisance des motifs ne fait pas entrer en jeu la question de l'équité procédurale, question qui appellerait l'application de la norme de la décision correcte; la Cour peut compléter les motifs en consultant le dossier et la déférence devrait être accordée lorsque le tribunal a bien saisi la question en litige et qu'il est parvenu à un résultat faisant sans aucun doute partie des issues possibles raisonnables.\n[14]\nLe caractère raisonnable d'une décision tient à sa justification, à sa transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nLes nouveaux éléments de preuve sont-ils admissibles?\n[15]\nDe façon préliminaire, le défendeur s'oppose à l'admission du second affidavit présenté par le demandeur à l'appui de la réponse de ce dernier à l'exposé des arguments du défendeur parce que des lettres du père et de l'oncle, qui visent à réfuter les déclarations de l'agente sur la situation qui règne au Nigéria, y sont jointes. Comme l'agente ne bénéficiait pas de ces lettres au moment de rendre sa décision, elles sont présumées inadmissibles:\nPremière nation d' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  confirmée par 2009 CAF 124.\n[16]\nCependant, la Cour peut, en considérant les facteurs énoncés dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , admettre de nouveaux éléments de preuve lorsqu'ils concernent l'équité procédurale et la compétence.\n[17]\nEn l'espèce, je suis convaincu que la preuve doit être admise, car elle porte sur une conclusion ayant trait à la situation régnant au Nigéria, à laquelle l'agente est parvenue en se fondant sur des éléments de preuve extrinsèques et sans inviter le demandeur à y répondre. Ces faits soulèvent la question de savoir si le demandeur a bénéficié de l'équité procédurale.\nLa décision de l'agente était-elle raisonnable?\n[18]\nIl était loisible à l'agente de tenir compte du fait que le demandeur n'avait pas vécu au Nigéria depuis 2006 et qu'il n'y était pas retourné pour visiter sa famille pendant ses vacances d'études en Europe. Comme l'a déclaré le juge de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> il est pertinent de considérer le fait qu'un demandeur n'est pas rentré dans son pays d'origine à la conclusion de voyages à l'étranger.\n[19]\nLe demandeur et son père ont expliqué pourquoi le demandeur n'était pas retourné chez lui: sa famille voulait qu'il se concentre sur ses études sans distraction. Bien que cela puisse peut-être sembler inusité dans le monde occidental, cela l'est peut-être moins en Afrique de l'Ouest. Quoi qu'il en soit, rien n'indique dans le dossier que l'agente s'est demandé si l'explication était raisonnable ou non.\n[20]\nEn ce qui a trait aux liens du demandeur avec le Nigéria, les motifs de l'agente ne sont pas transparents, justifiés et intelligibles. Le demandeur a vingt-cinq ans et est un étudiant, il est donc normal qu'il n'ait pas [traduction]  de conjointe, d'enfants ou de biens  au Nigéria ou ailleurs. De plus, l'agente n'a considéré ni le fait que toute la famille du demandeur vit au Nigéria, ni la force de ses liens avec sa famille:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22.\n[21]\nIl ne ressort pas des motifs de l'agente qu'elle a considéré le fait que le demandeur n'a aucun lien avec le Canada et aucune famille au Canada. Contrairement à la situation dans\nDoret,\nci-dessus, il a voyagé hors de son pays et, jusqu'à maintenant, son dossier révèle qu'il retourne dans les pays où il est un résident temporaire pendant qu'il poursuit ses études. De plus, il n'a eu aucune difficulté avec les autorités pendant qu'il vivait dans ces pays. Il me semble que ce dossier ne peut être utilisé pour soutenir l'inférence qu'il n'a pas l'intention de retourner au Nigéria après avoir terminé ses études.\n[22]\nEn ce qui a trait à la situation au Nigéria, rien dans le dossier certifié du tribunal n'étaye l'affirmation de l'agente selon laquelle le pays est divisé. La question n'a pas été portée à l'attention du demandeur et celui-ci n'a donc pas eu l'occasion de présenter des observations sur cette question. En fait, rien n'indique dans la décision communiquée au demandeur que l'agente a tenu compte du facteur de la situation actuelle au Nigéria pour rejeter la demande de visa. Le raisonnement n'apparaît que dans les notes de l'agente. La décision de l'agente doit reposer sur la preuve:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, au paragraphe 47.\n[23]\nLe défendeur soutient qu'il était loisible à l'agente de s'appuyer sur sa connaissance de la situation qui règne au Nigéria, et il invoque\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  à l'appui de cet argument. Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge de Montigny a accepté qu'un agent considère une preuve sur les conditions générales régnant dans le pays, mais a estimé que la preuve extrinsèque n'était ni corroborée, ni appuyée de documents et qu'elle n'était pas pertinente. Au paragraphe 34, il écrit:  [l] es généralisations et simplifications excessives de ce genre ne peuvent ni ne doivent former la base d'un examen qui doit toujours être individuel et fondé sur la situation particulière de la personne en cause . En l'espèce, l'agente est tombée dans le piège d'une généralisation et d'une simplification excessives et n'a pas procédé à un examen individuel.\n[24]\nQuoique je sois d'accord avec le défendeur que les agents d'immigration en viennent à très bien connaître la situation qui règne dans les pays à partir desquels les demandes de visa sont présentées, ces connaissances ne relèvent pas de la [traduction]  connaissance judiciaire comme il a été soutenu en plaidoirie. Ce concept, dans la mesure où il peut s'appliquer aux décisions administratives, ne pourrait intervenir que lorsque nul ne conteste les faits. En l'espèce, il est clair qu'il existe une différence d'opinions quant à la situation qui règne au Nigéria et quant à la question de savoir si cela pourrait avoir une incidence sur le retour futur du demandeur dans ce pays.\n[25]\nEn conclusion, j'estime que la décision de rejeter la demande de visa d'étudiant du demandeur était déraisonnable et j'ordonnerai que l'affaire soit renvoyée à un autre agent pour qu'il procède à un nouvel examen en conformité avec les présents motifs.\n[26]\nLes parties n'ont proposé aucune question de portée générale et aucune n'est certifiée.\nJUGEMENT\n[27]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\nla demande soit accueillie et que l'affaire soit renvoyée à un autre agent d'immigration pour qu'il procède à un nouvel examen conformément aux motifs du présent jugement.

  "full_text_en": "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 208)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nMosley, J.\nFebruary 13, 2012.\nCounsel:\nMalvin J. Harding, for the applicant;\nEdward Burnet, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nMalvin J. Harding, Surrey, British Columbia, for the applicant;\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nMosley, J.\n: The applicant, Mr. Ekomobong Akpan Obot, is a 25 year old graduate student from Nigeria. On three occasions in 2010 and 2011 he requested a visa to continue his education in Canada. Each request was refused on the ground that he would be unlikely to return to Nigeria on the completion of his studies.\n\n[2]\nMr. Obot applies for judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 of the decision made on May 5, 2011, by an Immigration Officer of the Canadian Embassy in Vienna. For the reasons that follow, the application is granted.\nBACKGROUND\n:\n\n[3]\nMr. Obot is from the delta region of southern Nigeria. His parents, siblings and extended family remain there. His mother is a qualified nurse employed at a university. A maternal uncle is a retired Rear Admiral of the Nigerian Navy. His father had a long career in government and is active in politics and business.\n\n[4]\nThe record indicates that Mr. Obot and his parents place a great emphasis on education. The father obtained undergraduate and graduate degrees at an American university. After working for a few years in the United States he returned to Nigeria with his family. Following high school, the applicant was sent to study in Europe. From 2006 to 2009 he attended the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest and obtained a B.Sc. in International Business and Economics. He then attended the International Business School in Budapest, affiliated with the Oxford Brookes University in the United Kingdom, and obtained a M.Sc. in Human Resources and Management in 2011.\n\n[5]\nDuring his studies abroad, the applicant did not return to Nigeria. During one summer break he visited relatives in the United Kingdom. He has not worked, other than one summer where he served as a volunteer in the United Kingdom. His parents have provided for his tuition and living costs.\n\n[6]\nThe applicant applied for and was admitted to a pre-Masters of Business Administration programme at Trinity Western University in British Columbia. This is described by the university as an upgrade programme to ensure that candidates have the basic language and other skills required to complete an MBA.\n\n[7]\nMr. Obot has acknowledged that his application for a United Kingdom visitor's visa was initially refused. It was granted on reconsideration. There is no evidence that the applicant abused the terms of that visa by overstaying. His application for a study visa in the United States was denied for reasons that are not part of the record. In addition to the three formal applications for a Canadian study visa, the applicant has requested reconsideration on two occasions. He has not previously sought judicial review of the refusals.\nDECISION UNDER REVIEW\n:\n\n[8]\nThe decision letter dated May 6, 2011 indicates that the application was rejected because the officer did not believe the applicant would leave Canada at the end of his stay. The officer's notes included in the Certified Tribunal Record, read in part as follows:\nApplicant has completed studies in Romania and Hungary. He is not established in any of these countries, he has completed what he had to do and has no reasons to return there after a stay in Cda. As for his country of origin, applicant had not resided in Nigeria since 2006. He has no children, property or career to return to. Many supporting documents were provided by father who's involved in national politics party that won the last election in APR11. Review of the conditions in Nigeria show that the election results were contested by opposition which led to riots and deaths (500 according to Red Cross estimations). The country is clearly divided in two following the elections and instable [sic] at the moment. As a result of the lack of ties to Romania, Hungary or Nigeria and of the conditions in Nigeria at the moment, I'm not satisfied there is sufficient evidence the applicant will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for stay. Refusing this application.\nISSUES\n:\n\n[9]\nThe issues raised by this application are:\na. whether the exhibits attached to the applicant's second affidavit are admissible as they were not before the officer when the decision was made; and\nb. whether the officer's decision was reasonable.\nRELEVANT LEGISLATION\n:\n\n[10]\nParagraph 20(1)(b) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 states:\n20. (1) Every foreign national, other than a foreign national referred to in section 19, who seeks to enter or remain in Canada must establish,\n(\nb\n) to become a temporary resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\n20. (1) L'étranger non visé à l'article 19 qui cherche à entrer au Canada ou à y séjourner est tenu de prouver:\nb\n) pour devenir un résident temporaire, qu'il détient les visa ou autres documents requis par règlement et aura quitté le Canada à la fin de la période de séjour autorisée.\n\n[11]\nParagraph 216(1)(b) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 (hereafter the Regulations) reads:\n216. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), an officer shall issue a study permit to a foreign national if, following an examination, it is established that the foreign national\n(\nb\n) will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay under Division 2 of Part 9;\n216. (1) Sous réserve des paragraphes (2) et (3), l'agent délivre un permis d'études à l'étranger si, à l'issue d'un contrôle, les éléments suivants sont établis:\nb\n) il quittera le Canada à la fin de la période de séjour qui lui est applicable au titre de la section 2 de la partie 9;\nANALYSIS\n:\nStandard of Review\n\n[12]\nThe parties are agreed and I accept that an Immigration Officer's decision based on the belief that the applicant will not leave Canada at the end of his stay is a question of mixed fact and law. The standard of review is therefore reasonableness:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[13]\nAs the Supreme Court of Canada has recently instructed in\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a review of the adequacy of reasons does not invoke procedural fairness requiring the correctness standard; the Court may supplement the reasons by reference to the record; and deference should be accorded where the tribunal is alive to the question at issue and comes to a decision well within the range of acceptable outcomes.\n\n[14]\nA finding of reasonableness is based on the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process and whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nIs the new evidence admissible?\n\n[15]\nAs a preliminary matter, the respondent objected to the admission of the applicant's second affidavit in support of his reply to the respondent's memorandum of argument as it attaches as exhibits letters from the applicant's father and uncle intended to rebut the officer's statements regarding conditions in Nigeria. As these letters were not before the officer at the time the decision was made, they are presumptively inadmissible:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aff'd by 2009 FCA 124.\n\n[16]\nHowever, the Court may admit new evidence where it relates to procedural fairness and jurisdiction and upon consideration of the factors set out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[17]\nIn this instance, I am satisfied that the evidence should be admitted as it relates to a finding about conditions in Nigeria which was apparently made on extrinsic evidence and without inviting a response from the applicant. Those circumstances give rise to the consideration of whether procedural fairness was accorded the applicant.\nWas the officer's decision reasonable?\n\n[18]\nIt was open to the officer to take into consideration the facts that the applicant had not lived in Nigeria since 2006 and had not returned there for visits with his family during breaks from his studies in Europe. As stated by Justice de Montigny in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the fact that an applicant does not have a history of returning to her country of origin from trips abroad is a relevant consideration.\n\n[19]\nThe applicant and his father provided an explanation for why he had not returned home - that the family wanted him to concentrate on his studies without distractions. While that may appear unusual from a western developed world perspective, it may be a more common practice in West Africa. In any event, there is no indication in the record that the officer considered whether the explanation was reasonable or not.\n\n[20]\nWith regards to the applicant's ties to Nigeria, the officer's reasons are not transparent, justified and intelligible. The applicant is 25 years old and a student, it is thus normal for him to have \"no spouse, children or property\" in Nigeria or anywhere else. Furthermore the officer did not consider that all of the applicant's family lives in Nigeria and did not consider the strength of his ties to his family:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[21]\nThe officer's reasons do not disclose that she considered the fact that the applicant has no ties to Canada and no family in Canada. Unlike in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, he has travelled outside of his country and, thus far, has a record of returning to the countries in which he is temporarily resident while pursuing his studies. And he has encountered no difficulties with the authorities while living in those countries. It seems to me that this record cannot be used to support the inference that he does not intend to go back to Nigeria upon completion of his studies.\n\n[22]\nWith regards to conditions in Nigeria, there is nothing in the certified tribunal record to support the officer's statement that the country was split. The issue was not brought to the attention of the applicant and thus the applicant did not have the opportunity to make submissions on the matter. In fact, the consideration of Nigeria's current situation as a factor for denying a visa does not appear in the decision communicated to the applicant. The reasoning only appears in the officer's notes. The officer's decision must be based on the evidence:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47.\n\n[23]\nThe respondent contends that it was open to the officer to rely on her knowledge of conditions in Nigeria and cites\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in support. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice de Montigny accepted that an officer could consider evidence of general country conditions but found that the extraneous evidence was unsupported, undocumented and irrelevant. At paragraph 34 he stated: \"[o] versimplified generalizations cannot and should not form the basis of what must always be an individualized assessment based on the particular circumstances of each individual.\" In this case the officer fell into the trap of an oversimplified generalization and did not conduct an individualized assessment.\n\n[24]\nWhile I agree with the respondent that immigration officers become well versed in the conditions within the countries from which visa applications are made, this awareness does not constitute a form of \"judicial notice\" as was suggested in oral argument. To the extent that concept may apply to administrative decisions it would only arise where the facts are beyond dispute. Here, there is clearly a difference of opinion about the conditions in Nigeria and whether that would have a bearing on the applicant's future return to that country.\n\n[25]\nIn the result I find that the decision to deny the applicant a student visa was unreasonable and I will order that the matter be remitted for reconsideration by a different officer in accordance with these reasons.\n\n[26]\nNo serious questions of general importance were proposed by the parties and none will be certified.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[27]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application is granted and the matter is remitted for reconsideration by a different Immigration Officer in accordance with the reasons for judgment. No questions are certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> plaintiff, Mr. Ekomobong Alpan Obot, is a 25-year-old graduate student from Nigeria.
