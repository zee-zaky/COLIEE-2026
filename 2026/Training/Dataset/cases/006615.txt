Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2014] F.T.R. TBEd. FE.018.
[1]
Beaudry, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review filed by the applicant under section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC 1985, c F-7, regarding a decision dated October 17, 2012, by an adjudicator appointed pursuant to the
Public Service Labour Relations Act
(SC 2003, c 22, s 2). The application for judicial review seeks to quash a part of the adjudicator's decision that deals with the amount awarded to the applicant for his first overtime shift.
Factual background
[2]
The applicant is a corrections officer at La Macaza Penitentiary in Quebec.
[3]
On December 20, 2011, he escorted an inmate outside of the Headquarters area during a non-contiguous overtime shift, that is, on a day of rest. This overtime shift started at 7:00 a.m. and ended at 3:00 p.m. It was followed by a second eight-hour overtime shift, from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., for which no advance notice was given.
[4]
The applicant was unable to take any meal breaks at any time during his two overtime shirts because there was no one to cover for him.
[5]
The applicant received 16 hours at double time for his overtime hours, two overtime meal allowances of $10 each and two paid 30-minute meal breaks at double time. However, following the final-level grievance response, the employer withdrew the two $10 meal allowances and the two meal breaks paid at the overtime rate.
[6]
The grievance was referred to the adjudicator to determine what the applicant was entitled to receive.
Impugned decision
[7]
The adjudicator referred to articles 21.07 and 21.15 of the collective agreement for the Correctional Services Group signed on June 26, 2006, by the Treasury Board and the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers - Syndicat des agents correctionnels du Canada - CSN (the collective agreement), appendices "C" and "D" to the collective agreement, and the Travel Directive of the National Joint Council (NJC Directive). These provisions are reproduced in Appendix "A", at the end of these reasons for judgment.
[8]
He found that article 21.15 and Appendix "C" cover the payment of meals and meal breaks for contiguous overtime shifts and do not apply to the applicant's first overtime shift. Section 5 of Appendix "C" expressly provides that neither that appendix nor article 21.15 applies if the employee is scheduled to work overtime on a day of rest and has been given prior notification to that effect, as in the present case. Article 21.15 and Appendix "C" apply only to the applicant's second shift, given that he did not receive prior notification of it.
[9]
The adjudicator found that Appendix "D" applies to both shifts, which under section 3(a) entitled the applicant to be reimbursed for reasonable meal expenses incurred "as normally defined by the Employer". Considering that Mr. Kearney, who works for the employer in a labour relations management position, testified that the employer uses the meal rates in the NJC Directive to determine what reasonable expenses may be reimbursed in accordance with Appendix "D", the adjudicator awarded the applicant a lunch allowance of $14.60 at the midpoint of his shift (paragraph 40 of the decision).
[10]
The adjudicator therefore determined that for his first overtime shift, the applicant was entitled to eight hours at double time and one meal, lunch, at the midpoint of his shift.
[11]
For his second, unscheduled shift, the applicant was entitled to eight hours at double time for the hours worked, one hour at double time for the meal break that he was unable to take, $40.30 for dinner and $15.35 for breakfast.
Issue
[12]
At issue is whether the adjudicator's decision is reasonable.
Standard of review
[13]
The adjudicator's decision concerns the interpretation of the collective agreement and its appendices, as well as his assessment of the evidence supporting the grievance. The standard of review in similar cases is reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Court must therefore consider whether the findings are justified, transparent and intelligible, and fall "within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
Applicant's arguments
[14]
The applicant submits that the parties to the collective agreement intended that corrections officers should have a half-hour meal break or, failing that, a half hour's pay at the applicable rate when an overtime shift is worked on a day of rest, or when any full period of eight hours is worked.
[15]
The adjudicator's decision is therefore unreasonable because it contradicts the parties' intentions and the evidence. In particular, he erred in ignoring the evidence showing that the applicant has always been entitled to paid meal breaks on his overtime shifts, including those worked on his days of rest. Moreover, in the present case, the employer gave the applicant an allowance for the two half-hour meal breaks that he was unable to take, and it was not until July 19, 2012, six years after the parties signed the collective agreement, that the employer changed its position and denied him a paid meal break, relying on a 2012 policy known as Bulletin 2012-11.
[16]
The adjudicator confused two concepts: allowances on the one hand and meal breaks on the other.
[17]
The applicant suggests that the only reasonable interpretation of articles 21.07 and 21.15 of the collective agreement and of its Appendix "C" entitles corrections officers to a meal break for each full period of eight hours worked, regardless of whether or not it is overtime work.
[18]
If for some absurd reason the parties to the collective agreement had intended to deny an officer working 16 hours a meal break on the first shift, they would have expressed this clearly in the agreement, which they did not do.
Respondent's arguments
[19]
The respondent submits that the provisions of the collective agreement are clear and unequivocal and that they create a distinction between pay for meal breaks during overtime hours worked just before or just after scheduled working hours and with overtime hours worked with prior notice.
[20]
The adjudicator's interpretation of the collective agreement is reasonable. He correctly stated that the more specific provisions of appendices "C" and "D" take precedence over articles 21.07 and 21.15, which are more general provisions (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[21]
Section 5 of Appendix "C" expressly states that where an employee is scheduled to work overtime on a day of rest, the provisions of article 21.15 and the benefits of Appendix "C" apply only with respect to overtime hours worked without prior notification. Because the applicant was given prior notification of his first shift on a day of rest, the monetary benefit set out in article 21.15 of the collective agreement and in section 6 of Appendix "C" does not apply to him.
[22]
Moreover, it was reasonable for the adjudicator to find that the half hour of overtime pay in lieu of an untaken meal break, as set out in article 21.07, does not apply to the applicant. Article 21.07 is found under the "General" heading, applies only to normal hours worked and does not mention overtime hours. The collective agreement contains specific provisions dealing with overtime situations.
[23]
The applicant criticizes the adjudicator for having ignored evidence of the employer's previous practices. However, evidence of past practice is extrinsic evidence. It is well established that when an adjudicator finds no ambiguity in how the document under consideration is to be interpreted, it is open to the adjudicator to not consider other evidence, such as extrinsic evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 11). In the present case, the collective agreement is clear, and there was no need for the adjudicator to consider the issue of extrinsic evidence.
[24]
The evidence shows that the employer did not have the same interpretation of the collective agreement as the one alleged by the applicant. Mr. Kearney testified that Bulletin No 2006-11 was drafted and then disseminated across the country to ensure that the collective agreement is applied uniformly with respect to the reimbursement of meals and the payment of meal breaks.
Analysis
[25]
The Court is of the opinion that the reasons for decision, at paragraphs 35 to 40, which aim to resolve the issue in this case, that is, to what benefits was Mr. Bernatchez entitled on his first overtime shift, are not unreasonable.
[26]
The Court's job in such situations is not to determine the best answer to be given to the questions submitted by the parties. Given the specialized expertise that adjudicators are recognized as having, the role of the Court must be limited to reviewing whether the adjudicator's decision meets the standard of reasonableness as set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[27]
In the case at bar, the adjudicator justified his finding by applying a specific provision dealing with a particular situation, rather than a general provision, to determine the rights and responsibilities of the parties (paragraph 35 of the decision). This approach is entirely logical.
[28]
The adjudicator's interpretation of the provisions of the collective agreement, its appendices and the NJC Directive in Appendix "A" is justifiable, intelligible and based on evidence. The Court's intervention is unwarranted in the circumstances.
[29]
However, the Court acknowledges that another interpretation could have been given, but the part of the decision in issue here has sufficient reasons, and its conclusion falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47).
[30]
At the suggestion of this Court, the parties agreed that the winning party would be awarded an amount of $1,500 for costs, plus GST and disbursements.
JUDGMENT
[31]
THE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
the application for judicial review be dismissed. The applicant shall pay the respondent an amount of $1,500 as costs, plus GST and disbursements.

d. When an employee is on travel status, meal and lodging allowances shall be those provided by Treasury Board policy.
APPENDIX "C"
OVERTIME MEAL ALLOWANCE
In view of the unique requirements found in the Correctional Service of Canada, and for the duration of the Correctional Services Group Collective Agreement, the Employer agrees to the following interpretation and application of the Overtime Meal Allowance.
1. The Overtime Meal Allowance will not be paid when an employee is provided with a meal(s) at departmental expense.
2. The "free meal" to be provided in lieu of the Overtime Meal Allowance means a regular full course meal as prepared in the institution where the employee is employed.
3. A snack or sandwiches will not be considered by the Employer as a full course meal.
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 21.15, when there is a reasonable expectation that an employee will work the full eight (8) hours' overtime shift, the first (1st) meal break will be allowed prior to the working of the first three (3) hours of overtime, and the second (2nd) meal break will be allowed after approximately four (4) hours of overtime have been worked.
5. Where an employee is scheduled to work overtime on a day of rest or on a designated paid holiday, the provisions of clause 21.15, and this appendix, shall be applicable to the employee only with respect to such additional overtime hours which the employee may work in excess of the employee's prior scheduled hours of overtime on that day without prior notification.
6. In the event that the Employer is unable to grant an employee reasonable time off with pay for the purpose of taking an overtime meal break, in lieu thereof the employee shall receive an additional one-half (½) hour of overtime compensation at the same overtime rate of the shift completed.
APPENDIX "D"
INMATE ESCORTS
For the duration of the Correctional Services Group Collective Agreement, the Employer agrees to the following:
1. To the extent practicable, the Employer will endeavour to avoid assigning Correctional Officers on inmate escorts on other than their regular working days.
2. When an officer is required to escort an inmate outside of the Headquarters area the employee will be compensated as follows:
a. the total period during which the officer is escorting the inmate or has the inmate under visual surveillance will be considered as time worked and the officer will be compensated at the applicable straight time and/or overtime rate;
b. an officer who is required to escort inmates at a time which is outside the officer's normal regular scheduled hours of work will be compensated at the applicable overtime rates;
c. an officer who escorts an inmate for a period of less than eight (8) hours will receive his or her regular pay for the day, that is eight (8) hours. However, on these occasions, where practicable, an officer may be required to perform other correctional officer duties for the balance of the eight (8) hour period;
d. on a statutory holiday or on a day of rest the employee will be compensated at the applicable overtime rate for the actual hours worked but in any event, no less than the equivalent of eight (8) hours at the straight-time rate;
e. all hours included between the time of reporting to the institution until the time of return shall be considered as hours worked when these hours are consecutive without interruption by overnight stopover for a suitable rest period;
f. when an officer's journey is interrupted by an overnight stopover the officer will be paid up to the time of the officer's arrival at his or her destination including normal travelling time to register at a hotel and will be paid for normal travelling time from the hotel to the officers point of departure. Thus, all hours between the normal time of registration at the hotel until the time of departure from the hotel will not be considered as hours worked;
g. on an inbound or outbound journey, without an inmate, the correctional officer will be compensated for his regular hours of work as if he or she had been working and the remaining time in travel to be compensated at the applicable overtime rate to a maximum of eight (8) hours;
h. on the return journey after a stopover and when escorting an inmate, the officer will be compensated as in paragraph (a) above;
i. when a Correctional Officer, who has been performing escort duty outside the officer's Headquarters area, does not have a reasonable rest period between the completion of the officer's escort duty and the start of his or her next scheduled shift, the officer will not be required to perform his or her duties for that day, however, the officer will receive a day's pay and the eight (8) hours will be deducted from the compensation earned during the period of escort.
3. When an officer is required to escort an inmate outside of the officer's Headquarters area the officers will be subject to the following travelling conditions:
g. an officer will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred as normally defined by the Employer;
h. an officer who is required to escort an inmate on a journey involving at least nine (9) hours will be given an overnight stopover whenever it is expected that the journey will exceed twelve (12) hours from the time of departure from the institution to the time of return to the institution;
i. whenever it is expected that an officer may be required to drive more than eighty (80) kilometers (fifty (50) miles) in any day beyond the number of kilometers normally defined by the Employer the officer will be given an overnight stopover.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  part du demandeur en vertu de l'article 18.1 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC (1985), ch F-7 concernant une décision datée du 17 octobre 2012 et rendue par un arbitre de grief nommé en vertu de la
Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique
, (LC 2003, ch 22, art 2). La demande de contrôle judiciaire vise à faire annuler une partie de la décision de l'arbitre relativement au montant accordé au demandeur lors de son premier quart de travail supplémentaire.
Le contexte factuel
[2]
Le demandeur est agent correctionnel au pénitencier La Macaza au Québec.
[3]
Le 20 décembre 2011, il effectue une escorte à l'extérieur de sa zone d'affectation lors d'un quart supplémentaire de travail non contigu à son quart de travail, soit lors d'un jour de repos. Ce quart de travail supplémentaire a commencé à 7 h et s'est terminé à 15 h. Ce premier quart de travail supplémentaire a été suivi d'un second quart de travail supplémentaire de huit heures, soit de 15 h à 23 h, et ce, sans préavis.
[4]
Le demandeur n'a pas pu prendre de pause-repas durant toute la durée de ses deux quarts de travail supplémentaire, car il n'a pas pu bénéficier d'une relève pour le remplacer.
[5]
Le demandeur a reçu 16 heures à temps double pour ces heures supplémentaires, deux indemnités de 10$ comme indemnité de repas et deux pauses-repas de 30 minutes payées à temps double. Cependant, à la suite de la réponse au grief au palier final, l'employeur lui a retiré les deux indemnités de repas de 10$ de même que les deux pauses-repas payées en heures supplémentaires.
[6]
Le grief a été envoyé à l'arbitre pour déterminer ce à quoi le demandeur avait droit.
Décision contestée
[7]
L'arbitre s'est référé aux clauses 21.07 et 21.15 ainsi que les appendices « C » et « D » de la convention collective signée le 26 juin 2006 pour le groupe des Services correctionnels par le Conseil du Trésor et l'Union of Canadian Correctional Officers - Syndicat des agents correctionnels du Canada - CSN (la « convention collective »), ainsi que la Directive sur les voyages du Conseil national mixte (Directive CNM). Ces dispositions sont reproduites dans l'annexe « A » à la fin de la présente décision.
[8]
Il a conclu que la clause 21.15 et l'appendice « C » visent le paiement de repas et de pauses-repas pour du temps supplémentaire fait de façon contigu à un quart de travail ne s'appliquent pas au premier quart de travail supplémentaire du demandeur. L'article 5 de l'appendice « C » prévoit expressément que ni cet appendice, ni la clause 21.15 ne s'appliquent si l'employé doit effectuer des heures supplémentaires un jour de repos et s'il avait reçu un préavis à cet effet, comme dans le présent cas. La clause 21.15 et l'appendice « C » s'appliquent seulement au deuxième quart de travail du demandeur étant donné qu'il n'y avait pas reçu de préavis.
[9]
L'arbitre a conclu que l'appendice « D » s'applique aux deux quarts de travail, ce qui donnait droit au demandeur, en vertu de la clause 3a), d'être remboursé pour ses dépenses de repas raisonnables « selon la définition habituelle de l'employeur ». Tenant en compte que M. Kearney, qui occupe un poste de direction en relations du travail pour l'employeur, a témoigné que l'employeur utilise les taux de repas de la Directive CNM pour définir quelles sont les dépenses raisonnables remboursables selon l'appendice « D », l'arbitre a accordé au demandeur un montant pour couvrir le déjeuné à 14.60$ au milieu de son quart de travail (para 40 de la décision).
[10]
L'arbitre a donc déterminé que pour son premier quart de travail en temps supplémentaire, le demandeur avait droit à huit heures à temps double et à un repas, celui du déjeuner, au milieu de son quart de travail.
[11]
Pour son deuxième quart de travail non prévu, le demandeur avait droit à huit heures à temps double pour les heures travaillées, une heure à temps double pour l'heure de pause-repas qu'il n'a pas pu prendre et à un dîner à 40.30$ et un petit-déjeuner à 15.35$.
Question en litige
[12]
La question en litige est celle de savoir si la décision de l'arbitre est raisonnable.
Norme de contrôle
[13]
La décision de l'arbitre porte sur l'interprétation de la convention collective et ses appendices ainsi que sur son évaluation de la preuve à l'origine du grief. La norme de contrôle dans des causes semblables est celle de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Alliance de la fonction publique de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La Cour doit donc se demander si les conclusions de l'arbitre sont justifiées, transparentes, intelligibles et appartiennent aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
Arguments du demandeur
[14]
Le demandeur prétend que les parties signataires à la convention collective avaient l'intention de faire bénéficier les officiers correctionnels d'une pause-repas d'une demi-heure ou, à défaut, une demi-heure de rémunération au taux applicable, lors d'un quart de travail en temps supplémentaire effectué lors d'une journée de repos, ainsi que pour toute période complète de huit heures quelle qu'elle soit.
[15]
La décision de l'arbitre est donc déraisonnable parce qu'elle contredit l'intention des parties ainsi que la preuve soumise. En particulier, il a erré en ignorant la preuve qui démontre que le demandeur a toujours eu droit aux pauses-repas rémunérées durant son travail en temps supplémentaire incluant celles pendant ses journées de repos. De plus, dans le cas à l'étude, l'employeur a octroyé au demandeur une indemnité pour ses deux pauses-repas d'une demi-heure chacune qu'il n'a pas pu prendre, et ce n'est que le 19 juillet, 2012, six ans après que les parties ont signé la convention collective, que l'employeur change de position et nie le droit à une pause-repas payée en se référant à une politique de l'année 2012 portant la désignation Bulletin 2012-11.
[16]
L'arbitre a confondu deux notions soit celle d'une indemnité et l'autre d'une pause- repas.
[17]
Le demandeur suggère que la seule interprétation raisonnable des articles 21.07, 21.15 et l'appendice « C » de la convention collective est de donner droit aux officiers correctionnels une pause-repas pour chaque période complète de huit heures au travail, n'importe si c'est du temps supplémentaire ou non.
[18]
Si les parties à la convention collective avaient l'intention absurde d'écarter une pause-repas lors du premier quart de travail d'un officier qui travaille seize heures, ils se seraient exprimés clairement sur ce point, ce qu'ils n'ont pas fait.
Arguments du défendeur
[19]
Le défendeur prétend que les dispositions de la convention collective sont claires et sans équivoques, et qu'elles créent une distinction entre la rémunération pour les pauses-repas durant les heures supplémentaires travaillées juste avant ou juste après les heures de travail prévues à l'horaire et avec les heures supplémentaires travaillées avec préavis.
[20]
L'interprétation de la convention collective par l'arbitre est raisonnable. Il a précisé correctement que les appendices « C » et « D » ont préséance comme dispositions plus spécifiques sur les clauses 21.07 et 21.15, qui sont des dispositions plus générales (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[21]
La clause 5 de l'appendice « C » stipule expressément que lorsqu'un employé doit effectuer des heures supplémentaires un jour de repos, les dispositions de la clause 21.15 et les avantages de cet appendice s'appliquent seulement aux heures supplémentaires effectuées sans préavis. En raison que le premier quart de travail effectué par le demandeur était fait avec préavis durant un jour de repos, l'avantage pécuniaire énuméré à la clause 21.15 de la convention collective et à la clause 6 de l'appendice « C » ne s'appliquent pas à lui.
[22]
De plus, il était raisonnable pour l'arbitre de conclure que le paiement d'une demi-heure de rémunération supplémentaire en remplacement de la pause-repas non prise énuméré à la clause 21.07 ne s'applique pas au demandeur. La clause 21.07 se trouve sous l'intitulé « Généralités » et s'applique seulement aux heures normales de travail et ne fait pas mention des heures supplémentaires. La convention collective contient des clauses spécifiques qui traitent les situations de temps supplémentaires.
[23]
Le demandeur reproche à l'arbitre d'avoir ignoré la preuve de la pratique antérieure de l'employeur. Cependant, la preuve d'une pratique passée est une preuve extrinsèque. Il est reconnu que lorsqu'un arbitre ne trouve pas d'ambigüités dans l'interprétation d'un document qu'il a à examiner, il est autorisé à ne pas tenir compte d'autres éléments tels que des preuves extrinsèques (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) au para 11). Dans la présente cause, la convention collective est claire, et l'arbitre n'avait pas besoin d'aborder la question d'une preuve extrinsèque.
[24]
La preuve démontre que l'employeur n'avait pas la même interprétation de la convention collective que celle alléguée par le demandeur. M. Kearney a témoigné que le Bulletin No 2006-11 a été rédigé et diffusé partout au pays pour assurer une application uniforme de la convention collective en ce qui concerne le remboursement des repas et le paiement des pauses-repas.
Analyse
[25]
La Cour est d'avis que les motifs de la décision, aux paragraphes 35 à 40, pour résoudre la question en litige c'est-à-dire « À quels avantages avait droit M. Bernatchez lors de son premier quart de travail supplémentaire ? » ne sont pas déraisonnables.
[26]
Le travail de la Cour dans des situations semblables n'est pas celui de rechercher quelle est la meilleure réponse qu'elle doit fournir aux questions soumises par les parties. Étant donné l'expertise spécialisée reconnue aux arbitres de grief, le rôle de la Cour doit se limiter à vérifier si la décision rendue rencontre les critères de la décision raisonnable tels qu'énoncés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[27]
Dans la cause à l'étude, l'arbitre a justifié sa conclusion en préférant appliquer une clause spécifique qui traite d'une situation particulière plutôt qu'une clause générale afin de déterminer les droits et les responsabilités des parties (para 35 de la décision). Cette approche est tout à fait logique.
[28]
L'interprétation des clauses de la convention collective, de ses appendices ainsi que de la Directive CNM énoncée à l'annexe «A » fournie par l'arbitre, est justifiable, intelligible et fondée sur la preuve. L'intervention de la Cour n'est pas souhaitable dans les circonstances.
[29]
La Cour reconnaît cependant qu'une autre interprétation aurait pu être donnée, mais la partie de la décision contestée ici est suffisamment motivée et sa conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au para 47).
[30]
Suite à la suggestion de la Cour, les parties ont convenu qu'une somme de 1500 $ à titre de frais en plus de la TPS et des déboursés, serait accordée à la partie gagnante.
JUGEMENT
[31]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée. Le demandeur devra payer au défendeur une somme de 1500 $ à titre de frais en plus de la TPS et des déboursés.

Lorsque l'employé-e doit effectuer des heures supplémentaires un jour de repos ou un jour férié désigné payé, les dispositions du paragraphe 21.15 et de l'accord énoncé dans la présente lettre ne s'appliquent à lui qu'en ce qui a trait aux heures supplémentaires effectuées sans préavis en sus des heures supplémentaires prévues pour ce jour-là.
6. Lorsque l'Employeur ne peut pas accorder à l'employé-e une période raisonnable de temps libre payé aux fins d'une pause-repas pendant les heures supplémentaires, ce dernier touche, en remplacement, une demi-heure (1/2) de rémunération au taux des heures supplémentaires du quart effectué.
APPENDICE « D »
ESCORTER DES DÉTENUS
L'Employeur convient des dispositions suivantes pendant la durée de la convention collective des agents correctionnels:
1. Dans la mesure du possible, l'Employeur s'efforce d'éviter de demander aux agents correctionnels d'escorter des détenus en dehors de leurs jours normaux de travail.
2. Lorsqu'un agent est tenu d'escorter un détenu à l'extérieur de la région de son lieu d'affectation, il est rémunéré comme suit:
a. la totalité de la période pendant laquelle il escorte ou surveille le détenu est considérée comme du temps de travail pour lequel il est rémunéré au taux des heures normales et/ou des heures supplémentaires applicables;
b. s'il est tenu d'escorter des détenus en dehors de ses heures normales de travail, il est rémunéré au taux des heures supplémentaires applicables;
c. s'il escorte un détenu pendant une période inférieure à huit (8) heures, il reçoit sa rémunération normale de la journée, c'est-à-dire de huit (8) heures. Cependant, dans ces cas-là, le cas échéant, il peut être tenu de remplir les fonctions d'un autre agent correctionnel pendant le reste de la période de huit (8) heures;
d. un jour de fête légale ou un jour de repos, il est rémunéré au taux des heures supplémentaires applicables pour les heures effectivement effectuées, le montant payé ne devant en aucun cas être inférieur à l'équivalent de huit (8) heures au taux des heures normales;
e. toutes les heures comprises entre l'heure d'entrée au travail et l'heure du retour à l'établissement sont considérées comme des heures de travail lorsqu'elles sont consécutives et non interrompues par un arrêt pour la nuit pour une période de repos appropriée;
f. lorsque son voyage est interrompu par un arrêt pour la nuit, il est rémunéré jusqu'à l'heure de son arrivée à destination, y compris le temps normal nécessaire pour se rendre à un hôtel, et il est rémunéré pour son temps normal de déplacement entre l'hôtel et son point de départ. Ainsi, toutes les heures comprises entre le moment normal de son inscription à l'hôtel et l'heure à laquelle il l'a quitté ne sont pas considérées comme des heures de travail;
g. pour son voyage de l'aller ou de retour, sans détenu, il est rémunéré pour ses heures régulières de travail comme s'il avait travaillé; le temps de voyage supplémentaire étant rémunéré au taux des heures supplémentaires applicables pour un maximum de huit (8) heures.
h. pendant son voyage de retour après un arrêt pour la nuit et qu'il escorte un détenu, il est rémunéré conformément à l'alinéa a) ci-dessus;
i. lorsque l'agent correctionnel qui a escorté un détenu en dehors de la région de son lieu d'affectation ne dispose pas d'une période de repos raisonnable entre la fin de son travail d'escorte et le début de son poste suivant à l'horaire, il n'est pas tenu de travailler ce jour-là; cependant, il touche la rémunération pour cette journée et les huit (8) heures sont déduites de la rémunération gagnée pendant la période d'escorte.
3. Lorsque l'agent est tenu d'escorter un détenu à l'extérieur de la région de son lieu d'affectation, il est assujetti aux conditions de voyage suivantes
:
g. les dépenses raisonnables engagées, selon la définition habituelle de l'Employeur, lui sont remboursées;
h. s'il est tenu d'escorter un détenu pendant un voyage d'une durée minimale de neuf (9) heures, il bénéficie d'une période d'arrêt pour la nuit lorsqu'on prévoit qu'il s'écoulera plus de douze (12) heures entre l'heure de départ de l'établissement et l'heure de retour;
i. lorsqu'on prévoit qu'il peut devoir conduire plus de quatre-vingts (80) kilomètres [cinquante (50) milles] un jour quelconque, en sus du nombre de kilomètres normalement établi par l'Employeur, il bénéficie d'un arrêt pour la nuit.
