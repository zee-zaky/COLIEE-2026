UPON
the Applicant seeking judicial review of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissing her appeal of the refusal of an application for permanent residence made by her husband wherein the Applicant had applied to sponsor her husband under the family class category pursuant to sections 12 and 13 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA);
AND UPON
reading the Certified Tribunal Record (CTR) and materials filed by the parties;
AND UPON
hearing the submissions of counsel for the parties;
AND UPON
the Court having considered the following in reaching its decision:
[1]
Strickland, J.
: The Applicant is a Canadian citizen. She met her husband, Mr. Efe Stanley Ogboru who is a Nigerian citizen, online on May 5, 2011. They pursued a relationship and he proposed to her on June 5, 2011. They met in person in Nigeria on September 12, 2011 and married there on September 17, 2011. Following the marriage, the Applicant returned to Canada to resume her employment. During a subsequent visit to Nigeria, they conceived a child and, on January 20, 2014, the Applicant and her husband had a son who was born in Canada.
[2]
In December 2011, the Applicant sponsored her husband as a member of the family class. A Visa Officer refused this application on April 26, 2012 on the basis of subsection 4(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (IRPA Regulations) that the marriage was not genuine and was entered into primarily to acquire immigration status or privilege. The Visa Officer's Global Case Management System (GCMS) notes indicate that there were concerns about the husband's identity and birth date.
[3]
The Applicant appealed the Visa Officer's decision to the IAD, a panel member of which (Member) dismissed the appeal on November 21, 2013, with written reasons dated January 10, 2014.
[4]
The Member was satisfied that the Applicant was credible and that for her the marriage is genuine and she did not primarily enter into it in order to assist her husband to acquire status or privilege in Canada. However, her husband was not credible due to inconsistencies in his evidence and his identity. The Member concluded that while the marriage was genuine, she was not satisfied that the husband did not enter it in order to acquire status or privilege under the IPRA.
[5]
Amongst other things, the Member noted that the marriage happened quickly and found that there were some inconsistencies in the husband's evidence. Further, that there was no clear, convincing and cogent evidence regarding the husband's identity, in particular with respect to his birth date, and that there was no record of his birth. For those reasons the Member found that the Applicant's husband was not a credible witness and highlighted the issue of his identity.
[6]
On this application for judicial review the sole issue that must be addressed is whether the failure to adjourn the hearing resulted in a denial of procedural fairness. This attracts the correctness standard of review (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[7]
The Applicant submits that the Member erred in failing to adjourn the hearing so that her husband's birth certificate and corresponding affidavit could be produced. These documents were referenced in the Visa Officer's decision, and put before the Visa Officer, but copies of these documents were not included in the CTR and were not before the Member when she made her decision. The transcript of the hearing demonstrates that the issue of the birth certificate was prominent, and therefore, the Member did not properly balance the competing interests or consider her ability to proceed in the absence of the missing information without causing injustice (
Immigration and Appeal Division Rules
, SOR/2002-230 (IAD Rules), subparagraph 48(4)(e);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is manifest and magnified by the Member's reliance on the missing documents and formed the central basis for finding that the husband was not credible.
[8]
The Respondent submits that there was no breach of procedural fairness. Rather, the Applicant is simply attempting to rectify what she perceived to be a mistake on her part at the IAD hearing. The Applicant cites subparagraph 48(4)(e) of the IAD Rules to substantiate her argument, but she did not submit a request to adjourn prior to the hearing nor did the Applicant pursue this when the Member raised this issue at the hearing. The issue of identity would only be relevant if the Member found the marriage to be genuine. In any event, based on the identity concerns, granting an adjournment to produce the birth certificate would not likely change the outcome.
[9]
The Respondent submitted at the hearing before me, and I agree, that the circumstances surrounding the hearing of this matter are unusual. A review of the transcript shows that the Member raised the fairness concern at the hearing in regard to the absence of documents from the record pertaining to the Applicant's husband's identity. There is also a question of whether the Applicant's interests were well served by her counsel at the hearing before the Member. Additionally, it appears that the telephone interview of the Applicant's husband was, in part, inaudible to those in attendance at the hearing.
[10]
A review of the hearing transcript indicates that, at the conclusion of questioning of the Applicant by her own counsel, the Member noted that the Visa Officer's concerns about her husband's identity had not been addressed. At that stage, counsel for the Respondent requested that section 40 of the IRPA be added as a ground of refusal and the Member agreed. This prompted the Applicant to ask for clarification of what this meant. The Member took her through the Visa Officer's interview notes and conclusion that there were concerns as to her husband's identity including that that his documents indicated three different birth dates and that he had recently declared that his date of birth was not as indicated on the older documents. The Applicant stated that the problem with the birth date had been recognized and that when the sponsorship application of her husband was submitted it included a sworn statement giving his actual birth date and attaching a copy of his birth certificate. When questioned by counsel for the Respondent, she confirmed that she had seen the birth certificate and that the date of birth recorded on it was April 22, 1978. The Member noted that Applicant's counsel had not objected to the adding of misrepresentation as a ground of refusal and that the Member had given him the opportunity to ask the Applicant questions as to her husband's identity but that counsel had not done so.
[11]
The Applicant's husband was then contacted by telephone. What is apparent from the transcript is that, regardless of who was directing the questions, a significant portion of his responses were and are recorded as "inaudible". At the hearing before me, counsel for the Respondent advised that he had listened to the tape of the hearing and, while a little more could be discerned, portions were still inaudible.
[12]
That said, when asked by the Applicant's counsel about the two birth dates given to the Visa Officer, her husband acknowledged this and gave a reply that was unintelligible and partly inaudible but confirmed his birth date was April 22, 1978. He confirmed when questioned by the Respondent's counsel that he had a birth certificate that was issued in Lagos in 2011 by the High Commission. There was a confusing exchange as to the date the birth certificate was issued (a review of the birth certificate shows that it does not have a date of issue) and whether his birth had been registered which was complicated by multiple inaudible sections. At this point counsel for the Respondent stated that he was leaving that line of questioning and submitted that the issue was not addressed in clear and cogent evidence. The birth certificate was then raised by the Member. The Applicant's husband confirmed that he had obtained a birth certificate from the High Commission but was unclear as to whether his birth had been registered in Auchi where he was born. When asked by the Member if counsel for the Applicant had any questions for the husband on the issue he said that he did not.
[13]
After the examination ended and Applicant's counsel made submissions, the Member stated that she wanted to put on the record that her job was to ensure that the Applicant had a fair hearing. She acknowledged that the Applicant was represented by counsel but that, in the middle of the hearing, the Respondent's counsel had asked to add misrepresentation as a ground of refusal. Her concern was that there was no documentation about the identity issue and Applicant's counsel had indicated that he had not looked at all of the documents submitted by the Applicant. She proposed that either misrepresentation be dropped as a ground of refusal or that she would hear submissions with respect to subsection 4(1) of the IRPA Regulations and then adjourn the hearing and allow the Applicant's counsel to provide documentation with respect to the Applicant's husband's identity and an opportunity for the Respondent's counsel to respond at that time.
[14]
The subsection 40(1)(a) ground of refusal was withdrawn. Counsel for the Applicant, when asked, agreed, stating that he did not think identity was a real issue. The Member pointed out that it was an issue in the record. Counsel for the Applicant stated that he had read this now but, when asked by the Member, confirmed that he had not read it before. The Member stated that this was a concern:
As I said this is a very serious issue for the appellant, it's before me, I have to ensure that she has a fair hearing. This is no fault of mine or the Minister's Counsel, but this issue has not been addressed with respect to his identity. Unless you object, Mr. Munro, I am going to adjourn the hearing so that this issue can be adequately looked at because frankly she seems surprised by it. Appellant's counsel has admitted that he hadn't really read the notes and wasn't aware that this was an issue for the visa officer, this was clearly an issue for the visa officer, it's at page 18 of the record: please have a look.
[15]
The Applicant herself submitted that she thought the sponsorship application with the birth certificate and the sworn affidavit had addressed the identity issue. The Respondent's counsel stated that those were not in evidence and the Member acknowledged that this was the problem and, again stated that she was going to adjourn unless there were objections. The Respondent's counsel then objected on the basis that subsection 4(1) was pivotal and that the Minister would be disadvantaged by an adjournment as the Respondent's counsel was retiring.
[16]
The Member did not make a ruling on the adjournment, but instructed the Respondent's counsel to proceed with his submissions. Upon the conclusion of those submissions, the Member immediately issued her decision orally.
[17]
That decision hinges primarily on the husband's identity and birth certificate. The Member states that the issue of his identity and birth date was not squarely addressed through documentation or oral evidence and that she did not have clear, convincing and cogent evidence with respect to his identity or his birth date. The Member went on to note that, given that the Visa Officer's refusal was a year ago, that the husband should have addressed this issue and inquired whether there was some sort of record of his birth or provided some sort of other document to prove his real birth date. She listed her other concerns but highlighted that the issue of the husband's identity with respect to his birth date was not addressed.
[18]
The problem with this, of course, is that the Applicant had advised the Member that the birth certificate and a sworn affidavit had been provided with her sponsorship application and that she had believed that this was before the IAD and was sufficient to address the identity concern. The Member at the hearing acknowledged this and also that identity was a critical issue, that she did not have the document before her, and, that it raised a procedural fairness issue.
[19]
In this regard, it is problematic that the Applicant's counsel at the hearing before the Member did not object to the proposed addition of the section 40 misrepresentation ground of refusal, subsequently dropped because of the identity evidentiary concerns, and did not advocate for the adjournment even though he acknowledged that he was not aware of the identity concern prior to the hearing and this concern was squarely raised by the Member who wished to adjourn so that it could be properly addressed in the interests of a fair hearing. In this regard, it is questionable if the Applicant's interest were well served. However, the Applicant did not impute the competence of her previous counsel (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) in her application for judicial review.
[20]
When deciding whether to grant an adjournment requested by a party the IAD must balance the factors set out in subsection 48(4) of the IAD Rules which include: any exceptional circumstances for allowing the application; in the case of a party who wants more time to obtain information in support of the party's arguments, the ability of the IAD to proceed in the absence of that information without causing an injustice; the knowledge and experience of any counsel who represents the party; whether allowing the application would unreasonably delay the proceedings; and, the nature and complexity of the matter to be heard. This is a question of mixed fact and law on which the standard of review is generally reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 51).
[21]
In this circumstance, it was the Member who raised the question of the need for an adjournment to ensure a fair hearing and, accordingly, subsection 48(4) has no application. However, it would appear that the IAD Rules would permit her to take that step of her own accord:
57. In the absence of a provision in these Rules dealing with a matter raised during an appeal, the Division may do whatever is necessary to deal with the matter.
58. The Division may
(a) act on its own initiative, without a party having to make an application or request to the Division;
(b) change a requirement of a rule;
(c) excuse a person from a requirement of a rule; and
(d) extend or shorten a time limit, before or after the time limit has pass
57. Dans le cas où les présentes règles ne contiennent pas de dispositions permettant de régler une question qui survient dans le cadre d'un appel, la Section peut prendre toute mesure nécessaire pour régler la question.
58. La Section peut:
a) agir de sa propre initiative sans qu'une partie n'ait à lui présenter une demande;
b) modifier une exigence d'une règle;
c) permettre à une partie de ne pas suivre une règle;
d) proroger ou abréger un délai avant ou après son expiration.
[22]
And, while the subsection 48(4) factors do not apply, they are perhaps useful as a nonbinding basis by which the need for an adjournment can be assessed (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]) and, all of which factors listed above would have favoured an adjournment in this case. In that regard I would also note that the Respondent's reasons for objecting to the adjournment were weak as this matter is not complex, could easily have been assumed by new counsel for the Respondent, as it ably was, and that no prejudice to the Minister would have arisen from an adjournment.
[23]
In my view, in these circumstances, the Member should have followed her own proposed course of action and adjourned the matter so that the identity and birth date issue could be addressed. The Member had the discretion to adjourn ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 25) and explicitly recognized a potential injustice if the matter proceeded in the absence of the identity documents. Yet, having done so, she proceeded with the hearing. This was open to her. However, her conclusion that she was not satisfied that the Applicant's husband had not entered into the marriage in order to acquire status or privilege under the IRPA hinged primarily on her finding that there was no clear, convincing and cogent evidence regarding the husband's identity, in particular with respect to his birth date and that there was no record of his birth. That issue potentially could have been addressed by the birth certificate and sworn statement not included in the record before her and was the very potential injustice that she had identified. Further, the Member had also identified that the Applicant's counsel was not alert to the identity issue prior to the hearing and had failed to address it during the hearing. In these unusual and particular circumstances, the failure to adjourn resulted in a breach of procedural fairness.
[24]
I recognize that, in the face of the identity concerns raised by the Visa Officer and upon review of the birth certificate and sworn statement when the matter is redetermined by another Member of the IAD, it is not at all certain that the outcome will differ. However, I am unable to conclude that the outcome would not have been any different regardless of the breach of procedural fairness and, therefore, the matter must be remitted for redetermination.
ORDER
[25]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
1. The application for judicial review is granted. The decision of the IAD dated January 10, 2014 is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the IAD for redetermination by a different member;
2. No question of general importance is proposed by the parties and none arises.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  présentée par la demanderesse à l'égard de la décision par laquelle la Section d'appel de l'immigration (la SAI) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a rejeté sa demande d'appel du rejet de la demande de résidence permanente présentée par son époux, dans le cadre de laquelle la demanderesse avait présenté une demande de parrainage de son époux au titre de la catégorie du regroupement familial en vertu des articles 12 et 13 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés

que la Cour a tenu compte de ce qui suit pour rendre sa décision:
[1]
La juge Strickland
[Traduction]: La demanderesse est citoyenne canadienne. Elle a rencontré son époux, M. Efe Stanley Ogboru, qui est citoyen du Nigeria, en ligne le 5 mai 2011. Ils ont poursuivi leur relation, et M. Ogboru a demandé la demanderesse en mariage le 5 juin 2011. Ils se sont rencontrés en personne au Nigeria le 12 septembre 2011, et ils s'y sont mariés le 17 septembre 2011. Après le mariage, la demanderesse est retournée au Canada pour reprendre son emploi. Pendant une visite ultérieure au Nigeria, ils ont conçu un enfant, et leur fils est né au Canada le 20 janvier 2014.
[2]
En décembre 2011, la demanderesse a parrainé son époux à titre de membre de la catégorie du regroupement familial. Un agent des visas a rejeté cette demande le 26 avril 2012 sur le fondement du paragraphe 4(1) du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 (le Règlement de la LIPR) au motif que le mariage n'était pas authentique et qu'il visait principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège. Les notes du Système mondial de gestion des cas (le SMGC) de l'agent des visas indiquent que ce dernier entretenait des doutes quant à l'identité et quant à la date de naissance de l'époux.
[3]
La demanderesse a interjeté appel de la décision de l'agent des visas à la SAI, et une commissaire (la commissaire) a rejeté l'appel le 21 novembre 2013; les motifs écrits sont datés du 10 janvier 2014.
[4]
La commissaire était convaincue que la demanderesse était crédible, qu'elle estimait que le mariage était authentique et qu'elle n'avait pas principalement contracté le mariage afin d'aider son époux à acquérir un statut ou un privilège au Canada. Cependant, son époux n'était pas crédible à cause d'incohérences dans son témoignage et dans la preuve relative à son identité. La commissaire a conclu que, bien que le mariage fût authentique, elle n'était pas convaincue que l'époux n'avait pas contracté le mariage pour acquérir un statut ou un privilège sous le régime de la LIPR.
[5]
Entre autres choses, la commissaire a souligné que le mariage avait été contracté rapidement et elle a conclu que le témoignage de l'époux renfermait des incohérences. En outre, elle a souligné qu'elle ne disposait pas d'une preuve claire et convaincante en ce qui concerne l'identité de l'époux, notamment en ce qui avait trait à sa date de naissance, et qu'il n'y avait aucun enregistrement de la naissance de ce dernier. Pour ces motifs, la commissaire a conclu que l'époux de la demanderesse n'était pas un témoin crédible, surtout compte tenu de ses doutes quant à son identité.
[6]
Voici la seule question qu'il faut trancher dans le cadre du présent contrôle judiciaire: l'omission d'ajourner l'audience a-t-elle entraîné un manquement à l'équité procédurale? La norme de contrôle applicable à cette question est celle de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[7]
La demanderesse soutient que la commissaire a commis une erreur en refusant d'ajourner l'audience afin que l'acte de naissance de son époux et l'affidavit connexe puissent être produits. L'agent des visas disposait de ces documents, et il en avait fait mention dans sa décision, mais le DCT ne renfermait aucune copie de ces documents, et la commissaire n'en était même pas saisie lorsqu'elle a rendu sa décision. La transcription de l'audience démontre que la question de l'acte de naissance était cruciale, et, par conséquent, la commissaire n'a pas soupesé correctement les intérêts contradictoires en jeu ou ne s'est pas demandé s'il était possible d'aller de l'avant en l'absence des renseignements manquants sans causer une injustice (
Règles de la section d'appel de l'immigration
, DORS/2002-230 (les Règles de la SAI), alinéa 48(4)
e
);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Cette erreur ressort très clairement du fait que la commissaire s'est principalement fondée sur les documents manquants pour tirer sa conclusion selon laquelle l'époux n'était pas crédible.
[8]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il n'y a eu aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale. La demanderesse tente plutôt de corriger ce qu'elle estime être une erreur qu'elle aurait commise lors de l'audience devant la SAI. La demanderesse invoque l'alinéa 48(4)
e
) des Règles de la SAI à l'appui de sa prétention, mais elle n'a pas présenté de demande d'ajournement avant l'audience et elle n'a pas non plus présenté pareille demande lorsque la commissaire a soulevé cette question à l'audience. La question de l'identité ne serait pertinente que si la commissaire avait estimé que le mariage était authentique. Quoi qu'il en soit, étant donné les doutes quant à l'identité de l'époux, l'octroi d'un ajournement afin que l'acte de naissance puisse être produit n'aurait vraisemblablement rien changé à l'issue de l'affaire.
[9]
Le défendeur a soutenu à l'audience devant moi que les circonstances entourant l'audience en l'espèce sont inhabituelles, et je suis d'accord avec lui. Un examen de la transcription révèle que la commissaire a soulevé la question de l'équité à l'audience en lien avec l'absence de documents concernant l'identité de l'époux de la demanderesse. Il y a aussi la question de savoir si le conseil de la demanderesse a bien servi les intérêts de cette dernière à l'audience devant la commissaire. En outre, il semble que les participants à l'audience aient parfois été incapables d'entendre l'époux de la demanderesse, qui a témoigné par téléphone.
[10]
Un examen de la transcription de l'audience révèle que, lorsque le conseil de la demanderesse a eu terminé de l'interroger, la commissaire a souligné que la question des doutes quant à l'identité de l'époux soulevés par l'agent des visas n'avaient pas été abordée. C'est alors que le défendeur a demandé à ce que le motif de rejet prévu à l'article 40 de la LIPR soit aussi envisagé, ce à quoi la commissaire a acquiescé. La demanderesse a alors demandé des précisions pour bien comprendre ce que cela voulait dire. La commissaire lui a exposé les notes d'entrevue de l'agent des visas, qui a conclu que la question de l'identité de l'époux de la demanderesse soulevait des préoccupations, notamment parce que les documents produits mentionnaient trois dates de naissance et parce que l'époux avait récemment affirmé que sa date de naissance ne figurait pas dans les documents les plus anciens. La demanderesse a affirmé qu'elle était au fait des doutes quant à la date de naissance de son époux et qu'une déclaration sous serment à laquelle était jointe une copie de l'acte de naissance de l'époux témoignant de sa vraie date de naissance avait été soumise dans le cadre de la demande de parrainage de son époux. Lorsque le conseil du défendeur l'a interrogée, la demanderesse a confirmé qu'elle avait déjà vu l'acte de naissance et qu'il y était inscrit que son époux était né le 22 avril 1978. La commissaire a souligné que le conseil de la demanderesse ne s'était pas opposé à ce qu'un motif de rejet soit ajouté, soit celui des fausses déclarations, et qu'elle lui avait donné la possibilité de poser des questions à la demanderesse concernant l'identité de son époux, mais qu'il n'avait pas interrogé la demanderesse.
[11]
On a alors communiqué avec l'époux de la demanderesse par téléphone. Il ressort clairement de la transcription que, peu importe qui posait les questions, de grandes parties des réponses de l'époux étaient « inaudibles », comme en témoigne la transcription. Lors de l'audience tenue devant moi, l'avocat du défendeur a fait savoir qu'il avait écouté l'enregistrement de l'audience et qu'il était possible de déchiffrer quelques extraits supplémentaires, mais que des passages étaient encore inaudibles.
[12]
Cela étant dit, lorsque le conseil de la demanderesse lui a posé une question concernant les deux dates de naissance soumises à l'agent des visas, l'époux a reconnu ce fait et il a donné une réponse incompréhensible et en partie inaudible, mais il a confirmé qu'il était né le 22 avril 1978. Lorsque le conseil du défendeur l'a interrogé, l'époux a confirmé qu'un acte de naissance lui avait été délivré à Lagos en 2011 par le haut-commissariat. Il y a eu un échange déroutant quant à la question de la date à laquelle l'acte de naissance avait été délivré (un examen de l'acte de naissance révèle qu'aucune date de délivrance n'y figure) et quant à la question de savoir si sa naissance avait été enregistrée; cet échange était difficile à comprendre, car de grandes parties du témoignage étaient inaudibles. À ce moment-là, le conseil du défendeur a dit qu'il laissait tomber ce sujet et il a soutenu qu'aucune preuve claire et convaincante n'avait été présentée à cet égard. La commissaire a alors soulevé la question de l'acte de naissance. L'époux de la demanderesse a confirmé qu'il avait obtenu un acte de naissance du haut-commissariat, mais il n'a pas été clair quant à savoir si sa naissance avait été enregistrée à Auchi, où il est né. Lorsque la commissaire a demandé au conseil de la demanderesse s'il souhaitait interroger l'époux à ce sujet, le conseil a répondu qu'il n'avait aucune question à lui poser.
[13]
Après l'interrogatoire et l'argumentation du conseil de la demanderesse, la commissaire a précisé que son rôle consistait à veiller à ce que la demanderesse ait une audience équitable. Elle a reconnu que la demanderesse était représentée par un conseil, mais, en pleine audience, le conseil du défendeur a demandé à ce qu'un motif de rejet soit ajouté, soit celui des fausses déclarations. La commissaire s'inquiétait du fait qu'elle n'était saisie d'aucun document ayant trait à la question de l'identité, et le conseil de la demanderesse avait dit qu'il n'avait pas examiné tous les documents soumis par la demanderesse. La commissaire a proposé que soit le motif de rejet des fausses déclarations soit écarté, soit qu'on lui soumette des observations au titre du paragraphe 4(1) du Règlement de la LIPR; par la suite, elle ajournerait l'audience afin de permettre au conseil de la demanderesse de produire des documents corroborant l'identité de l'époux; le conseil du défendeur aurait alors l'occasion de formuler des observations en réponse.
[14]
Le motif de rejet prévu à l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) a été écarté. Le conseil de la demanderesse, lorsqu'on lui a posé la question, s'est dit d'accord avec la commissaire, et il a affirmé qu'il ne pensait pas que la question de l'identité posait vraiment problème. La commissaire a souligné qu'il s'agissait d'une question importante en l'espèce. Le conseil de la demanderesse a dit qu'il venait tout juste d'en prendre connaissance et, quand la commissaire lui a posé la question, il a confirmé que s'était la première fois qu'il en prenait connaissance. La commissaire a alors fait état de ses inquiétudes:
[traduction]
Comme je l'ai dit, la question dont j'ai été saisie est très importante pour l'appelante, et je dois veiller à ce que cette dernière ait une audience équitable. Ce n'est nullement ma faute ni celle du conseil du ministre, mais la question de l'identité doit être débattue. À moins que vous vous y opposiez, monsieur Munro, je vais ajourner l'audience pour qu'on puisse examiner adéquatement cette question, parce que, bien franchement, l'appelante semble être surprise par la tournure des évènements. Le conseil de l'appelante a admis qu'il n'avait pas vraiment pris connaissance des notes et qu'il ne savait pas que l'agent des visas avait soulevé cette question; or, ce dernier avait clairement des réserves à cet égard, regardez à la page 18 du dossier s'il vous plaît.
[15]
La demanderesse elle-même a déclaré qu'elle pensait que la production de l'acte de naissance et de la déclaration sous serment soumis dans le cadre de la demande de parrainage avait réglé la question de l'identité de son époux. Le conseil du défendeur a affirmé que ces documents n'avaient pas été produits en preuve, et la commissaire a reconnu que cela posait problème, et cette dernière a répété qu'elle ajournerait l'audience à moins qu'on s'y oppose. Le conseil du défendeur s'y est opposé au motif que le paragraphe 4(1) constituait un élément central du dossier et que, puisqu'il allait prendre sa retraite, l'ajournement nuirait au ministre.
[16]
La commissaire ne s'est pas prononcée sur l'ajournement, mais elle a demandé à l'avocat du défendeur d'aller de l'avant et de lui présenter ses observations. Dès que le conseil eu terminé, la commissaire a rendu sa décision de vive voix.
[17]
La décision est essentiellement fondée sur la question de l'identité de l'époux et de l'acte de naissance. La commissaire a affirmé que la question de l'identité et de la date de naissance n'avait pas été abordée directement dans les documents ou le témoignage et qu'elle ne disposait pas d'une preuve claire et convaincante en ce qui concerne l'identité et la date de naissance de l'époux. La commissaire a par la suite souligné que, puisque l'agent des visas avait rejeté la demande il y avait un an, l'époux aurait dû entre-temps corriger la situation et essayer de trouver un enregistrement de sa naissance ou soumettre tout autre document témoignant de sa vraie date de naissance. La commissaire a exposé ses autres réserves, mais elle a mis l'accent sur le fait que la question de l'identité de l'époux et de sa date de naissance n'avait été pas abordée.
[18]
Le problème avec cette conclusion est, bien entendu, que la demanderesse avait avisé la commissaire que l'acte de naissance et la déclaration sous serment avaient été soumis dans le cadre de la demande de parrainage et qu'elle avait dit qu'elle croyait que la SAI avait été saisie de ces documents et que ces derniers suffisaient pour trancher cette question. La commissaire, au cours de l'audience, a reconnu ces faits, et elle a aussi affirmé que la question de l'identité de l'époux était cruciale, que ces documents ne lui avaient pas été soumis et que le fait qu'elle ne dispose pas de ces documents soulevait une question d'équité procédurale.

À cet égard, la conduite du conseil de la demanderesse à l'audience pose problème. Ce dernier ne s'est pas opposé à l'ajout du motif de rejet prévu à l'article 40, soit les fausses déclarations, lequel motif a par la suite été écarté à cause des doutes quant à l'identité de l'époux que soulevait la preuve; qui plus est, le conseil de la demanderesse n'a pas demandé l'ajournement de l'audience, et ce, même s'il avait reconnu que, avant l'audience, il ne savait rien des doutes quant à l'identité de l'époux et même si ces doutes avaient expressément été soulevés par la commissaire, qui souhaitait d'ailleurs, pour veiller à ce que l'audience soit équitable, ajourner l'audience afin que la question puisse être adéquatement abordée. On peut donc se demander si les intérêts de la demanderesse ont été bien servis. Cependant, la demanderesse n'a pas remis en question la compétence de son ancien conseil dans le cadre de sa demande de contrôle judiciaire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
Pour statuer sur la demande d'ajournement présentée par une partie, la SAI doit soupeser les facteurs énoncés au paragraphe 48(4) des Règles de la SAI, y compris les suivants: toute circonstance exceptionnelle qui justifie le changement; dans le cas où la partie a besoin d'un délai supplémentaire pour obtenir des renseignements appuyant ses arguments, la possibilité pour la SAI d'aller de l'avant en l'absence de ces renseignements sans causer une injustice; dans le cas où la partie est représentée, les connaissances et l'expérience de son conseil; si le fait d'accueillir la demande ralentirait l'affaire de manière déraisonnable; la nature et la complexité de l'affaire. Il s'agit d'une question mixte de fait et de droit qui est d'ordinaire susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 51).
[21]
En l'espèce, c'est la commissaire qui a soulevé la question de savoir s'il était nécessaire d'ajourner l'audience afin que la demanderesse ait une audience équitable et, par conséquent, le paragraphe 48(4) n'est donc pas applicable. Il semble toutefois que, selon les Règles de la SAI, la commissaire aurait pu prendre cette décision de son propre chef:
57. Dans le cas où les présentes règles ne contiennent pas de dispositions permettant de régler une question qui survient dans le cadre d'un appel, la Section peut prendre toute mesure nécessaire pour régler la question.
58. La Section peut:
a) agir de sa propre initiative sans qu'une partie n'ait à lui présenter une demande;
b) modifier une exigence d'une règle;
c) permettre à une partie de ne pas suivre une règle
d) proroger ou abréger un délai avant ou après son expiration.
57. In the absence of a provision in these Rules dealing with a matter raised during an appeal, the Division may do whatever is necessary to deal with the matter.
58. The Division may
(a) act on its own initiative, without a party having to make an application or request to the Division;
(b) change a requirement of a rule;
(c) excuse a person from a requirement of a rule; and
(d) extend or shorten a time limit, before or after the time limit has pass.
[22]
En outre, bien que les facteurs énoncés au paragraphe 48(4) ne trouvent pas application en l'espèce, ils sont peut-être utiles en ce sens qu'ils peuvent fournir un fondement non contraignant au titre duquel on peut déterminer si l'audience doit être ajournée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), et les facteurs exposés ci-dessus militaient en faveur d'un ajournement en l'espèce. À cet égard, il convient de souligner que les motifs pour lesquels le défendeur s'est opposé à l'ajournement étaient peu convaincants, puisqu'il ne s'agit pas d'une affaire complexe et qu'un autre avocat aurait pu représenter le défendeur, qui avait jusqu'alors été très bien représenté, et le ministre n'aurait subi aucun préjudice si l'audience avait été ajournée.
[23]
À mon avis, dans ces circonstances, la commissaire aurait dû, de son propre chef, ajourner l'audience afin que les questions de l'identité et de la date de naissance puissent être abordées. La commissaire avait le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'ajourner l'audience ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 25) et elle avait expressément reconnu qu'une injustice pourrait être commise si l'affaire allait de l'avant en l'absence des documents ayant trait à l'identité de l'époux. La commissaire a malgré tout pris la décision d'aller de l'avant. Il était loisible à la commissaire de prendre cette décision. Cependant, sa conclusion selon laquelle elle n'était pas convaincue que l'époux de la demanderesse n'avait pas contracté le mariage pour acquérir un statut ou un privilège sous le régime de la LIPR reposait principalement sur le fait qu'elle avait estimé qu'elle ne disposait pas d'une preuve claire et convaincante en ce qui concernait l'identité de l'époux, surtout en ce qui avait trait à sa date de naissance, et qu'il n'y avait aucun enregistrement de sa naissance. Cette question aurait pu être tranchée par la production de l'acte de naissance et de la déclaration sous serment qui ne se trouvaient pas dans le dossier dont elle était saisie, et c'est justement cette question qui, selon la commissaire, aurait très bien pu mener à une injustice. En outre, la commissaire a aussi fait remarquer que le conseil de la demanderesse ne savait pas avant l'audience que la question de l'identité posait problème, et qu'il n'avait pas abordé la question à l'audience. Compte tenu de ces circonstances inhabituelles, l'omission d'ajourner l'audience a entraîné un manquement à l'équité procédurale.
[24]
Compte tenu des doutes de l'agent des visas quant à l'identité de l'époux de la demanderesse, je suis consciente du fait qu'il se peut très bien que l'issue de l'affaire ne soit pas différente à la suite de l'examen de l'acte de naissance et de la déclaration sous serment qui sera effectué lorsque l'affaire sera réexaminée par un autre commissaire de la SAI. Cependant, je ne peux pas conclure que l'issue aurait été semblable, peu importe qu'il y ait eu manquement à l'équité procédurale, et, par conséquent, l'affaire doit être renvoyée pour nouvel examen.
ORDONNANCE
[25]
