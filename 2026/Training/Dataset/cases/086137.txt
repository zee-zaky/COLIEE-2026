Walsh, D.J.
: Applicants move for:
1. An order of prohibition against the Government of Canada, acting through the Department of the Secretary of State, from making any further disbursements of funds under the
1991 Contribution Agreement Governing Funds under the Aboriginal Constitutional Review Program
(the "
Contribution Agreement
") until,
(i) it has provided to the Native Women's Association of Canada an amount of funds equal to that provided to the Assembly of First Nations, the Native Council of Canada, the Métis National Council, and the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada ("the four recipient groups") pursuant to that
Agreement
, and on the same terms and conditions; and
(ii) it has provided to the Native Women's Association of Canada rights to participate in the constitutional review process on the same terms and in the same way as the four recipient groups, including participation in any First Ministers' Meetings or Conferences to discuss constitutional renewal which take place in the next two years.
[2]
The grounds for the motion are set out at some length therein and will be considered in dealing with the argument. They can be summarized by saying that applicants believe that the Government of Canada proposes to make a disbursement of funds under the
Contribution Agreement
to the four groups before April 1, 1992, resulting in providing resources for them to further their participation in the constitutional renewal discussions now underway in Canada among various governments and that some of the four recipient groups have taken the position that the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
should not apply to aboriginal self-government activities under any proposed reconfiguration of the Canadian
Constitution
. It is contended that by financing the four recipient groups in the constitutional renewal discussions under way the Government of Canada is assisting some of them to propagate the view that the said
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
should not apply to aboriginal self-government activities, whereas applicants and other aboriginal women's groups require similar funding and participation in said discussions as they consider that it is essential that the said
Charter
should continue to apply in order to safeguard and promote the equality of aboriginal women. It is contended that the Government of Canada has exhibited an historical preference for the views of male-dominated aboriginal groups on issues relating to women's equality and that by disbursing funds to the four recipient groups without providing equivalent facilitation for the expression of opinion by the applicants and other pro-
Charter
aboriginal women's groups, the Government of Canada is infringing the
Charter
, by which it is bound, contravening s. 28 which states that
Charter
rights are guaranteed equally to male and female persons, by depriving the unfunded groups of a comparable opportunity to win public opinion to their views. It is also contended that this violates s. 35(4) of the
Constitution Act
1982
which under the heading "Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada" states that, existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada which are recognized and confirmed in subs. (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons. Section 15 of the
Charter
which, inter alia, bars discrimination based on sex or national and ethnic origin is also invoked as guaranteeing their equality under the law, which allegedly is violated by disbursements which further advocacy aimed at securing the removal of rights and freedoms guaranteed by the
Charter
. Applicants' argument concludes that the actions of the Government of Canada in disbursing these funds are unconstitutional and as it lacks jurisdiction to disburse them an order of prohibition is sought to prevent this.
[3]
The application is supported by two well-drawn affidavits of Gail Stacey-Moore, Chief Elected Officer of the Native Women's Association of Canada, and Sharon McIvor, an Executive Member of the Native Women's Association of Canada for the West Region, having been involved in the Native Women's movement since 1978. Both applicants are exceptionally well qualified to make these affidavits and, in particular, the voluminous affidavit of Gail Stacey-Moore is practically a history of the aboriginal Indian Movement in Canada, outlining, well documented by Exhibits, the perceived inequities of the
Indian Act
as applied to women and the unequal and unfair treatment they receive at the hands of Indian males in the various bands.
[4]
At the outset of the hearing the court made it clear that the issue of alleged unequal and unfair treatment of aboriginal women by aboriginal men is not a matter to be considered in the present proceedings, which must be limited to the constitutionality of the said unequal distribution of funds as between male dominated aboriginal groups and groups representing aboriginal women, and whether this constitutes a breach of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
so that the argument on this issue will therefore proceed on the basis that, even assuming and accepting that aboriginal women are not in many cases treated equally with aboriginal males in aboriginal society and therefore wish to retain the protection given those by the
Charter of Rights
to equal treatment, does this unequal disbursement of funds constitute a violation of the
Charter
.
[5]
Important subsidiary arguments are whether the court should intervene by way of prohibition to set aside a discretionary decision, of an administrative nature relating to disbursement of Government funds, and a third issue as to whether, even if the court has discretion to issue such an order whether it should be exercised when it appears that the motive for seeking it is to prevent a possible recommendation adverse to their interests being made as a result of the constitutional renewal discussions about to commence, which recommendation, even if it were made, would in no way be a final decision until and unless subsequently adopted and legislated - in other words to prevent at the outset such a recommendation from being made. This is an attack on funding which allegedly will assist in arguments leading to such a possible recommendation (or agreement to recommend it, if agreed to by the participants in the discussions), and is clearly made on a "quia timet" basis.
Interventions
[6]
The motion did not join as respondents the Assembly of First Nations, the Native Council of Canada, the Métis National Council, or the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, although the order sought is to prevent any further distribution of funds to them under the
1991 Contribution Agreement Governing Funds under the Aboriginal Constitutional Review Program
until funds are provided to applicants under the same terms and conditions. Clearly, therefore intervenants have a financial interest to protect.
[7]
As a consequence, motions seeking leave to intervene were introduced at the commencement of the hearing on behalf of three of them, The Native Council of Canada, the Métis National Council and the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada. The Assembly of First Nations did not present such a motion. These interventions were opposed by applicants.
[8]
Prior to recent amendments to the
Federal Court Rules
the leading authorities on interventions were to the effect that it is not merely sufficient that the intervenor has a real interest in the outcome but that it can also bring a different point of view or perspective from that which will be brought to the attention of the tribunal by parties already in the record. See in this connection
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 510. In the present case it is abundantly clear that respondent will oppose vigorously the order sought by applicants not to distribute further funds to the groups in question, which is of course what the would-be intervenors will also be opposing so there might well be an unnecessary duplication of argument.
[9]
The attention of the court was directed to the recent amendment to Federal Court Rule 1602 effective February 1, 1992, s. (3) of which states "Any interested person who is adverse to the applicant in the proceedings before the federal board, commission or other tribunal
shall be
named as a respondent in the notice of motion." This article deals with applications for judicial review, however, of decisions by a federal board, commission or other tribunal, and respondent, Her Majesty The Queen, cannot be so considered. I am aware that there is jurisprudence to the effect that in naming Her as a respondent, this may nevertheless encompass Ministers of the Crown but whether this extends to unnamed federal boards, commissions or other tribunals, or whoever entered into the
Contribution Agreement
distributing the funds, so as to make rule 1602 applicable would appear doubtful. It is not necessary for me to decide whether this rule applies here since an additional argument by counsel for the Native Council of Canada points out that even without such a rule, fundamental justice requires that they be made parties. Applicants refer to agreements made with them which they seek to have stayed but although applicants served copies of the material on them, they did not add them as parties. The jurisprudence to which I was referred dealt with third parties which had an interest in litigation between others, and not with a party which has a fundamental interest of its own which is being attacked in the proceedings.
[10]
The Inuit Tapirisat in seeking to intervene contend that they have factual evidence to submit different from that of the others, to the effect that applicants do not represent them as their women have their own association, that they are not seeking separate funding and that in their society women are not disadvantaged and do not contend that they are.
[11]
Finally it was pointed out by counsel for applicants that respondent had not submitted any affidavit material but merely a written memorandum of law and fact which must necessarily be based on the material submitted by applicants as to the facts and should not now be allowed to take advantage of the affidavits as to facts and arguments advanced by the would-be intervenants, or cross-examination which had already taken place on these affidavits. I am satisfied that the prospective intervenants are in a position to supply factual information of use to the court in deciding this matter, in many cases containing information which respondent could not have provided, and that it is therefore in the interest of justice that the affidavits, exhibits, and cross-examination on affidavits be filed in the record.
[12]
Counsel for applicants contended that if the interventions are allowed the Crown should be asked to pay the costs of them, as by admitting them evidence was being introduced which respondent had failed to do. Bearing in mind that had they been named as respondents in the first instance no motion to intervene would have been necessary weakens the thrust of this argument. However, since I find the interventions were only marginally useful, although no blame is attributed to intervenants for bringing them, and I would have reached the same conclusions in disposing of applicants' motion even if there had been no interventions, it may not be fair to award the substantial costs of them against the applicants herein, the Native Women's Association of Canada. I therefore exercise my discretion and allow the interventions but without costs.
[13]
The style of cause will be changed accordingly to reflect these interventions.
Facts
[14]
The facts giving the background for this application are found in various affidavits, exhibits and other documents in the record and are for the most part not contested by the parties.
[15]
A Government of Canada document dated September 24, 1991 entitled
Shaping Canada's Future Together - Proposals
states "the Government of Canada proposes an amendment to the Constitution to enrich a general justiciable right to aboriginal self-government in order to recognize aboriginal peoples' autonomy over their own affairs within the Canadian federation". In the next paragraph it is stated "such a right would provide for recognition of the differing circumstances and needs of the different aboriginal people in Canada, and would be exercised within the Canadian constitutional framework,
subject to the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
". (Emphasis added)
[16]
The report of the Special Joint Committee on a Renewed Canada dated January 24, 1992 (the Beaudoin-Dobbie Committee) refers to several aboriginal organizations who are developing their own charter with a different balance of collective and individual rights more attuned to their particular traditions - but states that the processes are ongoing and their final positions are still to be determined. It states "the Committee heard from the Native Women's Association of Canada, who strongly supported the continued application of the
Charter
. They also proposed that aboriginal self-government should be entrenched in a way that ensures its equal application to men and women. We recommend that the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Canadians, including the equality of the rights of men and women, ought to receive full constitutional protection."
[17]
On January 24, 1992, the Hon. Joe Clark, Minister for Constitutional Affairs, wrote Ms. Stacey-Moore in reply to her letter outlining the position of the Native Women's Association of Canada on this question. He states "The Government of Canada has always taken the position that the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
should apply to Aboriginal governments." He adds "the federal governments' proposals reiterate our intention in this regard".
[18]
On February 19, 1992, in answer to the same letter from Ms. Stacey-Moore, the Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney reiterates the view "the Government of Canada has consistently taken the position that the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
should apply to Aboriginal governments".
[19]
A supplementary affidavit by Gail Stacey-Moore casts doubt on the Government's intention to express applicants' point of view at the forthcoming constitutional conference. In a letter to her dated March 2, 1992 Right Honourable Joe Clark refers to a discussion with her about representation at the conference table and states "the concerns you have raised, like those raised by others must be addressed within the aboriginal community itself. They will not be rectified through the addition of another seat to the constitutional table."
[20]
He states that the national Aboriginal associations do represent both men and women in their communities and urges her to work with them to ensure that the Native Women's Association of Canada views are heard and represented through them. He adds that it is for that reason that the funding agreements signed by the national Aboriginal associations require that they specifically direct portions of their funding to Aboriginal women's issues and in addition the government has provided some project funding in support of specific activities and future funding will be determined by the nature of the process.
[21]
Needless to say this letter was far from reassuring for applicants who contend that the aboriginal associations within their communities are dominated by males so they cannot count on them to make adequate representations reflecting the aboriginal women's views in the forthcoming round of constitutional discussions, and that the portion of the funding allocated to them by these groups is minuscule in proportion to the amounts these groups have received.
[22]
Facts supporting these contentions are that at an Aboriginal Conference on the Constitution held in Ottawa on March 13-15, 1992, out of 184 delegates Native Women's Association of Canada had only eight seats and four observers. To get the eight seats which had not originally been allocated, four were obtained from the Native Council of Canada, and the rest from the Government of Canada complement. On funding, out of $10,000,000 allocated to the four interest groups under the
Contribution Agreement
the Native Women's Association of Canada received $130,000 from each of the Assembly of First Nations and Native Council of Canada, or a total of $260,000. It is conceded that core funding is also received from the Secretary of State to run its office and provide for four employees, but none of these is devoted to constitutional purposes, and that a grant was also received from the Secretary of State to fund a study of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. Respondent refers to total grants direct from the Government of $300,000 in addition to the $260,000 given out of the $10,000,000 awarded to the four funded groups. In any event, it is not disputed that 5% funding they received in proportion to the amounts awarded to the four funded groups referred to in the application herein is comparatively trivial, especially as it is alleged that women represent 52% of the aboriginals.
[23]
Respondent points out that a great many issues are to be considered at the forthcoming Conference of which the continuing application of the
Charter
to aboriginal governments in the event that aboriginal groups should be given a measure of self-government is only one, whereas the
Charter
issue is the only one which appears to concern the applicants herein or on which they wish to express a view which may be opposed to that of at least some of the four groups funded to represent aboriginals, and that this would explain the disparity in the funding. Native Women's Association of Canada representatives counter that there is nothing limiting their participation to the one issue, as they are entitled to consider all issues which will be under discussion. It is of interest to note that when the funding agreements with the four groups were signed to provide funds for the four groups in question for participation in studies and conferences relating to constitutional renewal (which agreements were not produced) this was many months before when, on or about March 11, 1992 it was recommended that Aboriginal peoples be invited to be full participants in the constitutional process agreed upon. It cannot be said therefore that the funding was provided expressly for participation in the forthcoming Conference.
[24]
In any event, any consideration of the adequacy of the funding or representation must depend on the determination of the legal issues as to whether there is any infringement of the
Charter
if N.W.C.A. is not recognized as a distinct group having interests which are not fully represented by the four funded groups and entitled to equal representation and funding.
[25]
During discussion of the applications for leave to intervene the Native Women's Association of Canada pointed out that two of the groups - the Assembly of First Nations and the Métis National Council have already received the full amounts allotted to them under the
1991 Contribution Agreement
and therefore have no interest in intervening in this motion, but that the Native Council of Canada and the Inuit Tapirisat still have funds to receive by virtue of the
Agreement
. (It will be recalled that the Assembly of First Nations has not sought to intervene.) While full consideration was given to this argument at that stage of proceedings, all interventions were allowed since it was felt that the factual material they might submit would be helpful and moreover a decision made on this motion might well affect the rights of all four groups in distribution of funds under future agreements, including that for the 1992-1993 fiscal year now being discussed.
[26]
This is a double-edged argument in any event, since, if two of the groups have already received all the funding allowed under the
1991 Contribution Agreement
one might ask why applicants seek this order against them. It is evident, and I believe applicants would admit that what is of primary concern to them and what they seek is a finding that they are really a fifth group legally entitled to receive equal funding to each of the four groups similar to funding provided for the said groups which they claim are male dominated and do not adequately represent them, and also to equal representation at Conferences concerning proposed constitutional amendments affecting aboriginals and in particular aboriginal women. Such a finding would then be applicable when future
Contribution Agreements
are under discussion.
[27]
With respect to the positions which applicants expect the four groups in question to take at the forthcoming Conference, it is primarily the position of the Assembly of First Nations which they fear. That group is alleged to be strongly of the view that the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
should not apply to Aboriginal self-government. It has expressed interest in establishing an
Aboriginal Charter of Rights
and objects to any
Charter
being imposed on them by others.
[28]
The Métis National Council supports the retention of the Canadian
Charter
.
[29]
The Inuit Tapirisat is willing to consider the application of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
to Inuit self-government arrangements which may be negotiated between them and the Government of Canada, and their women's group will fully participate in any discussion with respect to its continued application.
[30]
The Native Council of Canada's position is somewhat more equivocal. It takes the position that the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
should apply to
Indian Act
governments but that with respect to self-government activities that is the sole domain of the aboriginal governments in question. It does not suggest that the
Charter
should not apply, but that this is up to the nations themselves.
[31]
Without in any way attempting to predict what discussions will take place at the Conference, on the
Charter
rights issue, or the contents of same, it is apparent from these statements of facts that the issue of maintenance of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
notwithstanding whatever recommendation may be made about Aboriginal self-government will be one of the subjects discussed and supported by at least some of the participants, including most probably the representatives of the Government of Canada, although some doubt may have been cast on the position they will take with respect to the
Charter
by the recent letter of the Rt. Hon. Joe Clark of March 2, 1992 to which I have already referred in which he suggests that the Native Women's Association of Canada's issues must be addressed within the Aboriginal community itself, stating that the Aboriginal associations do represent both men and women from their communities and that Native Women's Association of Canada should work through them to ensure that their views are represented and heard.
Conclusions In Law
[32]
There is no issue, nor can there be, that the applicants herein are subject to all the rights set out in the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
including s. 2(b) "freedom of expression" and, s. 15 equal treatment before the law and equal protection and benefit of it without discrimination based on "ethnic origin" or "sex". Section 28 guarantees these rights equally to male and female persons. Part II of the
Constitution Act 1982
in s. 35(4) guarantees existing aboriginal and treaty rights of aboriginal peoples equally to male and female persons.
[33]
It is these undisputed principles which applicants seek to apply to the facts of this case. It was argued on the basis of accepting, for the purposes of this motion but not as a conclusion, that in Aboriginal societies or at least a substantial number of them women are not treated by men as equals, are disadvantaged with respect to them, do not share their views on all issues and cannot rely on them to present their viewpoint at Conferences such as that about to take place. It was also accepted that they receive a disproportionate amount of the Government funding made available to the four groups which they contend do not adequately represent their interests. (It should be repeated here that at least one of the groups - the Inuit Tapirisat strongly disputes those assumptions made even for the purpose of arguing this case, pointing out that their society is totally different from that of the other named Aboriginal groups (or associations), that women are not disadvantaged in it, and do not seek separate funding or representation.)
[34]
Applicants argue that without being recognized as a group with separate and distinct interests from those of the male groups chosen to participate and represent them, and accordingly being given equivalent funding, their views cannot be properly represented and that this is an interference with their freedom of speech.
[35]
On the facts it is evident that the Native Women's Association of Canada has had and will continue to have many opportunities to express its views, both to the appropriate political authorities, to the public and even to the groups which will participate in the Conference, some at least of whom share the Native Women's Association of Canada's concern respecting the continued application of the
Charter
to Aboriginal people. Undoubtedly the more money placed at their disposal the louder their voice could be heard, but it certainly cannot be said that they are being deprived of the right of freedom of speech in contravention of the
Charter
.
[36]
As counsel for respondent points out reliance on freedom of expression as a basis of the right to be present at the discussion table is a claim that any individual or interest group might make, and, in discussion of proposals for constitutional amendment to hold that freedom of expression creates a right for everyone to have a voice in these discussions would paralyze the process.
[37]
I do not conclude therefore that there has been any infringement of applicants'
Charter
rights of freedom of expression.
[38]
With respect to discrimination as to sex the disproportionate funds provided for the Native Women's Association of Canada results not from the fact that they are women but from the unwillingness of the Government to recognize that they should be considered as a separate group within the aboriginal community from the four named groups and treated accordingly. Whether this is fair or contrary to natural justice will be dealt with under another argument respecting the issue of a writ of prohibition, but it does not constitute per se discrimination on the basis of sex in contravention of the
Charter
.
[39]
This leads to another issue to be examined - that of the jurisdiction of the court to issue a writ of prohibition in these proceedings. On the facts and in the absence of production of the
Contribution Agreement
it is not too clear who made or makes the decisions respecting the distribution of funds. Apparently they are provided under the auspices of the Department of the Secretary of State. It may not matter whether the distribution is decided or made by a Federal Cabinet Minister or Ministers or by the Federal Cabinet. The principle that there is no immunity for orders-in-council unlawfully made was enunciated in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 1, in which at page 748 S.C.R., Justice Estey noted:
"Let it be said at the outset that the mere fact that a statutory power is vested in the Governor-in-Council does not mean that it is beyond review."
[40]
At page 752 in the same judgment it is stated:
"It is not helpful in my view to attempt to classify the action or function by the Governor-in-Council ... into one of the traditional categories established in the development of administrative law."
And again
"In my view the essence of the principle of law here operating is simply that in the exercise of a statutory power the Governor-in-Council, like any other person or group of persons, must keep within the law as laid down by Parliament ..."
[41]
It is not disputed that the court has jurisdiction to also review or set aside decisions of Cabinet Ministers made in contravention of the law.
[42]
There is also no dispute as to the duty of the decision maker to act fairly and in accordance with natural justice in making the decision. The
Martineau-Matsqui
decision and others have gone beyond the former doctrine of audi alteram partem, extending it to the duty to act fairly, and the demarcation line between quasi-judicial and administrative decisions has all but disappeared.
[43]
To say that the court has the right to issue a writ of prohibition in this case is far from concluding however that it should exercise that right. Applicants' principal complaints about breach of the duty to act fairly are first - the composition of the groups chosen for funding and participation in the conference, and second - the failure to recognize Aboriginal women as a separate group, distinct from the funded groups. The disparity in funding is a consequence of this failure to so recognize them.
[44]
It is true that on the first issue there is no evidence in the record as to how the groups were selected, only the explanation given in argument by respondent. It should be noted, however, that neither is there any suggestion by applicants as to what other groups (other of course than themselves) would have been more representative of the Aboriginal people than the broadly-based umbrella groups selected. Respondent's written submission states "it is evident that governments have invited the four national Aboriginal organizations to participate fully in the discussion because they consider these organizations to be broadly representative of the Aboriginal peoples as a whole not of some particular constituency". Reference was made to the decision of Krever, J. (as he then was), in the unreported case of
Federation of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  1982
imposes a duty on the Prime Minister to invite representatives of the aboriginal peoples of Canada to that First Ministers' Conference. That subsection cannot reasonably be interpreted as requiring the Prime Minister to invite to the Conference representatives of every special interest group among the aboriginal peoples of Canada."
And again,
"In the absence of a showing of bad faith, the determination of the appropriate representatives of the aboriginal peoples is, in essence, a political determination, that is to say, a determination that cannot properly be made by the courts. To repeat, there is no bad faith and it cannot be said that the Prime Minister's selection of invitees frustrates the policy and objects of s. 37.1 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
."
To conclude on this issue I find nothing unfair or contrary to natural justice in the selection of the said four groups to represent the Aboriginals at this conference.
[45]
On the second allegation of unfairness - the failure to recognize the Native Women's Association of Canada as being "distinct" the position of the respondent is set out in the letter of Rt. Hon. Joe Clark of March 2, 1992 already referred to, in which, after stating that their concerns raised like those raised by others must be addressed within the Aboriginal community itself he said "The national Aboriginal Associations do represent both men and women in their communities."
[46]
His statement may be accurate in theory but possibly wrong in practical application in view of Native Women's Association of Canada's assertions that they often have different interests from those of the males in their communities and are kept in a subservient and minority position. The Native Women's Association of Canada representatives' position had certainly been heard and considered however before this letter was written, and a decision, whether right or wrong, is not unfair or contrary to natural justice because it does not accept the arguments made to the contrary. There is no breach of any regulation in making the funding and representation decisions, these being matters within the discretion of those making them.
[47]
One further issue should be dealt with, namely, that the results which applicants hope to obtain in their fear of loss of
Charter
protection is speculative. This would only occur if the participants in the constitutional discussion accepted the position of the Assembly of First Nations and others on this issue and if subsequently resolutions to that effect were adopted by Parliament and the legislatures. Applicants will have further opportunities to express their concerns before any such change becomes law, if in fact any such changes will even be recommended. As Dickson, J. (as he then was), stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 481; 13 C.R.R. 287, at pages 457-458 S.C.R. (although he was dealing with declaratory judgments and injunctions)
"As this court stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dispute in issue was merely speculative."
[48]
The purpose of the impending multicultural discussions on the
Constitution
is to "bring the Canada Round to a successful conclusion". Success will be measured by the level of agreement reached as to the proposals for constitutional amendments to be incorporated in draft parliamentary resolutions. The discussions are therefore only part of the legislative process in which courts should not intervene.
[49]
In
Reference Re Canada Assistance Plan
, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 525, Mr. Justice Sopinka stated at page 559:
"The formulation and introduction of a bill are part of the legislative process with which the courts will not meddle ... it is not the place of the courts to interpose further procedural requirements in the legislative process."
[50]
This is another reason for refusing to issue a writ of prohibition at this stage.
[51]
For all of the above reasons, applicants' application is dismissed with costs, if asked for.
Application dismissed.
