Lafrenière, Prothonotary
: This is a motion to strike portions of the application pursuant to paragraph 6(5)(b) of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
[
PMNOC Regulations
].
INTRODUCTION
[2]
The underlying proceeding is an application by the Applicants, Bayer Inc. and Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH [herein referred to collectively in the singular as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] under section 55.2(4) of the
Patent Act
and section 6 of the
PMNOC Regulations
. Bayer seeks a declaration that a letter from the Respondent, Pharmaceutical Partners of Canada Inc. [PPC] to Bayer dated April 8, 2014 is not a notice of allegation and detailed statement for the purpose of the
PMNOC Regulations
and has no legal effect. In the alternative, Bayer seeks an order prohibiting the Minister of Health from issuing a notice of compliance to PPC for its proposed moxifloxacin hydrochloride product for injection until the expiration of three of Bayer's patents, including Canadian Patent No. 2,378,424 [the 424 Patent].
[3]
PPC has moved for an order pursuant to paragraph 6(5)(b) of the
PMNOC Regulations
striking portions of Bayer's application on the grounds that the application, insofar as it relates to the 424 Patent, is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious or is otherwise an abuse of process. PPC maintains that Bayer's evidence simply cannot support a conclusion of direct infringement or inducing infringement by PPC.
[4]
PPC did not file any evidence in support of its motion. It relies solely on the affidavit evidence served by Bayer in the main proceeding relating to the infringement or induced infringement of the 424 Patent and, more particularly, the affidavits of two experts, Dr. Linda Dresser and Dr. Roland Grossman. Since Bayer did not file any additional evidence in response to the motion and no cross-examination was conducted of Bayer's two deponents, the facts on this motion are not in dispute.
FACTS
[5]
PPC filed an Abbreviated New Drug Submission [ANDS] to obtain a Notice of Compliance [NOC] for a moxifloxacin hydrochloride intravenous solution for injection to be marketed in Canada under the name PPC-Moxifloxacin. PPC compares PPC-Moxifloxacin with AVELOX® I.V., Bayer's version of moxifloxacin hydrochloride intravenous solution for injection.
[6]
Three patents are listed on the Patent Register in respect of AVELOX® I.V., namely, Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,340,114, Canadian Letters Patent No. 2,192,418 and the 424 Patent. As noted above, this motion pertains only to the 424 Patent. The 424 Patent is entitled "Moxifloxacin Formulation Containing Common Salt". It discloses and claims a moxifloxacin formulation for parenteral administration, including a formulation for intravenous administration. All 49 claims of the 424 Patent require the inclusion of moxifloxacin and sodium chloride within specified concentrations.
[7]
Independent Claim 1 of the 424 Patent claims in particular:
An aqueous formulation comprising:
from 0.04% to 0.4% (w/v) of moxifloxacin hydrochloride, based on the amount of moxifloxacin, and
from 0.4% to 0.9% (w/v) of sodium chloride.
[8]
PPC-Moxifloxacin XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The non-medicinal ingredients in PPC-Moxifloxacin are XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
[9]
One of Bayer's experts, Dr. Dresser, is a hospital pharmacist with over 25 years of experience. She is familiar with, and has advised physicians on, the administration of AVELOX® I.V. and its co-administration with sodium chloride solutions. Bayer's other expert, Dr. Grossman, is a staff physician at Credit Valley Hospital and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He is a world-renowned expert on the use of antibiotics, including moxifloxacin, in the treatment of respiratory infections such as community-acquired pneumonia.
[10]
Dr. Dresser provides evidence relating to the construction of the 424 Patent and its claims. She has reviewed PPC's Product Monograph and provides evidence on how that document would be understood and applied in practice. She notes that the Product Monograph indicates that PPC-Moxifloxacin is compatible for co-administration with the same six intravenous solutions as AVELOX® I.V. The relevant extract read as follows:
Moxifloxacin injection is compatible with the following intravenous solutions at ratios from 1:10 to 10:1
:
•→ 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP
•→ IM Sodium Chloride Injection
•→ 5% Dextrose Injection, USP
•→ Sterile Water for Injection, USP
•→ 10% Dextrose for Injection, USP
•→ Lactated Ringer's for Injection
[11]
Both Dr. Dresser and Dr. Grossman explain how PPC-Moxifloxacin will or will likely be used and sold if PPC receives a NOC for PPC-Moxifloxacin. Dr. Dresser asserts that, in order to sell PPC-Moxifloxacin, PPC will have to submit bids to supply hospitals, seeking to have those hospitals stock and dispense PPC-Moxifloxacin instead of AVELOX® I.V. She asserts that if PPC obtains a NOC for PPC-Moxifloxacin:
(a) PPC-Moxifloxacin will be co-administered with a 0.9% sodium chloride saline solution in certain ratios using a
"Y"
connection.
(b) The formulation that will be administered to patients will infringe certain claims of the 424 Patent.
(c) The resulting formulation that is administered to the patient will contain moxifloxacin and sodium chloride and will infringe claims 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 37, 38 and 49 of the 424 Patent.
[12]
Bayer concedes that there is no evidence of any direct infringement of the 424 Patent by PPC. It maintains, however, that health practitioners will infringe the 424 Patent as a direct result of PPC's representations in its Product Monograph and its attempts to have PPC-Moxifloxacin substituted for AVELOX® I.V.
[13]
Counsel for Bayer agreed during the hearing of the motion that the evidence of induced infringement by PPC boils down to paragraph 42 of the affidavit of Dr. Dresser, which reads as follows:
Based on the content of the PPC Product Monograph, if the PPC Product was to be marketed in Canada, as a pharmacist I would advise physicians that the PPC Product can be prescribed, used and administered in the same way as AVELOX® I.V. It is therefore my opinion that, as instructed by the PPC Product Monographs, physicians would prescribe and use the PPC Product in the same was as AVELOX® I.V., including co-administering the PPC Product with a normal saline solution in circumstances where the treating physician determines it to be advisable.
[14]
PPC submits that Bayer's evidence, taken at its best, cannot possibly establish direct infringement or induced infringement of the 424 Patent by PPC and that the application, as it relates to the 424 Patent, should be dismissed.
ANALYSIS
[15]
The present motion is brought by PPC, a second person within the meaning of the
PMNOC Regulations
, pursuant to subsection 6(5)(b), which reads as follows:
6. (5) Subject to subsection (5.1), in a proceeding in respect of an application under subsection (1), the court may, on the motion of a second person, dismiss the application in whole or in part ...
(b) on the ground that it is redundant, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious or is otherwise an abuse of process in respect of one or more patents.
6. (5) Sous réserve du paragraphe (5.1), lors de l'instance relative à la demande visée au paragraphe (1), le tribunal peut, sur requête de la seconde personne, rejeter tout ou partie de la demande si, selon le cas ...
b) il conclut qu'elle est inutile, scandaleuse, frivole ou vexatoire ou constitue autrement, à l'égard d'un ou plusieurs brevets, un abus de procédure.
[16]
The purpose of s. 6(5) is to enable the Court to expeditiously dispose of unmeritorious applications by first persons which have no chance of succeeding at hearing. The parties agree that dismissal of an application pursuant to subsection 6(5)(b) is an extraordinary remedy. Such relief will only be granted when the application is "clearly futile" or it is "plain and obvious" that the application has no chance of success:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Sanofi-Aventis
] at para 28 and 36. The moving party bears the entire burden of proof in a s. 6(5)(b) motion:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[17]
A second person may move under s. 6(5)(b) to dismiss a first person's application on the basis that the first person's affidavit evidence is insufficient to prove the second person's allegations of infringement are not justified:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], at para 13. In order to make such a determination, the motions judge must be able to make the necessary findings of fact, viewed in the light most favourable to the first person, and apply the law to the facts.
[18]
A motion to dismiss will only be granted where it is apparent that there is no arguable case on the merits of the application. The court is not justified in embarking on anything resembling a trial of the action on conflicting affidavits in order to evaluate the strength of either party's case.
Inducement
[19]
Bayer has not adduced any evidence establishing or even suggesting that PPC would directly infringe the 424 Patent. The said patent claims a formulation which contains moxifloxacin and sodium chloride within certain specified concentrations. Dr. Dresser acknowledges in her affidavit that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX therefore, there is no direct infringement by PPC. Rather, Bayer says that PPC will induce or procure others to infringe the 424 Patent.
[20]
Bayer submits that the evidence is clear that PPC's Product Monograph directs infringement of the 424 Patent and that the sale of PPC-Moxifloxacin will result in the infringement of the 424 Patent.
[21]
In Dr. Dresser's opinion, the PPC Product will be co-administered with a 0.9% sodium chloride saline solution within the ratios of the 424 Patent if a Notice of Compliance is issued in respect of the PPC Product and PPC sells the PPC Product for use in accordance with the PPC Product Monograph.
[22]
According to Bayer, its evidence demonstrates that:
(a) the use of PPC-Moxifloxacin will infringe the 424 Patent;
(b) such infringement will be a direct result of representations made by PPC in its Product Monograph and as a result of PPC seeking to have PPC-Moxifloxacin dispensed in place of Bayer AVELOX® I.V.; and
(c) PPC made those representations knowing that infringement of the 454 Patent is an inevitable consequence.
[23]
It is well established that there is no infringement of a patent in selling an article which does not in itself infringe the patent even when the vendor knows that the purchaser buys the article for the purpose of using it in the infringement of the patent:
Slater Steel Industries Ltd v R Payer Co
(1968), 38 Fox Pat C 139, 1968 CarswellNat 29, 55 CPR 61 (Can Ex Ct); citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (SCC).
[24]
It is not sufficient to say that pharmacists or physicians would prescribe PPC-Moxifloxacin in an infringing manner and therefore inducement is made out. It is the second person's actions which are at issue, and not the infringing conduct of others, as was found by Madam Justice Mactavish in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 369:
367
Based upon all of the above considerations, the applicants argue that because of the nature of the Canadian market for memantine, infringement of the '492 patent will inevitably occur as physicians will prescribe, pharmacists will dispense, and patients will use ratiopharm's memantine product in combination therapy.
368
This may well be the case. Indeed, the circumstantial evidence suggests that ratiopharm's ratio-MEMANTINE product may indeed end up being used in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, thereby infringing the '492 patent. ratiopharm may expect this to happen. However, it is ratiopharm's actions and not its expectations that are the issue before me.
369
The parties agree that the fact that there may be downstream infringement is not enough, on its own, to show infringement by inducement. Indeed, as Justice Gauthier observed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. (4th)) 161, even if it can be shown that infringement by others "is highly probable, if not inevitable", that will not be enough to establish that an allegation of non-infringement is not justified: see para. 31.
[25]
A second person may be implicated in the infringement by others of a patent if the second person induces that infringement. The test for inducement was articulated by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 162. First, the act of infringement must have been completed by the direct infringer. Second, the completion of the acts of infringement must be influenced by the acts of the alleged inducer to the point that, without the influence, direct infringement would not take place. Third, the influence must knowingly be exercised by the inducer, that is, the inducer knows that this influence will result in the completion of the act of infringement.
[26]
The test for inducement is conjunctive, which means that Bayer must establish all three elements of the test in order to succeed in the application. Counsel for PPC submits that Bayer's deponents do not provide any evidence of influence exercised by PPC that would result in the completion of an act of infringement of the 424 Patent, knowingly or otherwise, and that it is therefore plain and obvious that the application cannot succeed in respect of the 424 Patent.
[27]
PPC states in its Product Monograph that PPC-Moxifloxacin is safe to use with sodium choloride and can be administered in sequence with a solution containing sodium chloride. The Product Monograph also states that dilution of PPC-Moxifloxacin with another solution (including, presumably, sodium chloride solutions) is not required. Based on these statements, Dr. Dresser is of the opinion that physicians would prescribe, use and administer PPC-Moxifloxacin in the same way as AVELOX® I.V. "as instructed by the PPC Product Monograph".
[28]
In my view, Bayer has no reasonable chance of success on the second prong of the inducement test set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> based on the evidence before the Court. Integral to the issue of inducement is the requirement that the alleged inducer influence the direct infringer. There is nothing in PPC's Product Monograph that is capable of establishing that PPC will infringe the 424 patent by inducing infringement by others.
[29]
Infringement by inducement may be established by inferences reasonably drawn from the contents of the product monograph for the generic drug product, or evidence relating to the dosage form of the generic product, or its labelling or marketing:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The problem with Bayer's evidence is that there are no facts, other than Dr. Dresser's opinion, to support a conclusion that PPC is "instructing" others to infringe the 424 Patent. Whether such instructions are actually provided in PPC's Product Monograph is a question of fact, and not a matter of opinion. It is one matter for an expert to provide assistance to the Court in interpreting technical terms and quite another for the expert to proffer an opinion on the very issue to be decided by the Court.
[30]
It should be recalled that PPC is seeking a Notice of Compliance to permit it to market and sell its own non-infringing product. PPC has not yet marketed its product. There is no evidence, other than speculation, that PPC will be seeking to sell its product in combination with sodium chloride. Moreover, there is no evidence of any overt attempt by PPC to influence or encourage others to infringe the 424 Patent.
[31]
There are certainly no explicit instructions or directions to complete an act of infringement such as found in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> "subtle references" in a product monograph may be enough to leave a reader with the impression that a drug can be used in a manner that would infringe a patent. However, the general and generic references to sodium chloride in PPC's Product Monograph do not amount to inducement. There is no suggestion that the PPC-Moxifloxacin should be substituted for, or used in same way as, AVELOX® I.V. PPC's Product Monograph also specifies in bold caps that PPC-Moxifloxacin does not require dilution. Merely stating that PPC-Moxifloxacin is safe for dilution with one of six intravaneous solutions, including sodium chloride, or that it can be used in sequence with solutions containing sodium chloride, without more, is not sufficient to conclude that PPC is knowingly inducing healthcare practitioners to co-administer PPC-Moxifloxacin with sodium chloride.
[33]
Bayer submits that PPC clearly intends for PPC-Moxifloxacin to be substituted for AVELOX® I.V. and administered to patients in the same manner as AVELOX® I.V, as evidenced by the manner in which PPC will sell its product. Dr. Dresser asserts that once the PPC Product enters the market in Canada, PPC will have to approach hospitals or wholesalers to convince them to dispense PPC-Moxifloxacin instead of AVELOX® I.V. This is nothing more than conjecture and speculation on the part of Dr. Dresser. If PPC does in fact induce or procure another person to infringe the 424 Patent, Bayer will have recourse in an action for infringement.
[34]
The onus is on Bayer in the main application to establish on a balance of probabilities that the allegation that PPC will not induce others to infringe the 424 Patent is unjustified. PPC has established that, on the record before me, it is plain and obvious that Bayer has no reasonable chance of success in showing that PPC is or will be inducing infringement of the 424 Patent. As the test for inducement is conjunctive, and Bayer has not adduced any evidence that can arguably satisfy all three prongs of the test for inducement, I conclude that the prohibition application as it relates to the 424 Patent will inevitably fail. As such it is "vexatious" within the meaning of s. 6(5) of the
PMNOC Regulations
.
CONCLUSION
[35]
For the reasons above, I conclude that the motion pursuant to subsection 6(5)(b) of the
PMNOC Regulations
striking portions of the application relating to the 424 Patent should be granted.
[36]
Counsel agreed that costs fixed in the amount of $5,000.00 should be awarded to any party that was entirely successful on the motion. In the circumstances, costs shall be granted to PPC in the agreed amount.
ORDER
[37]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
:
1. All portions of the application relating to the 424 Patent is dismissed.
2. Costs of the motion, hereby fixed in the amount of $5,000.00, inclusive of disbursements and taxes, shall be paid by the Applicants to the Respondent, Pharmaceutical Partners of Canada Inc.

Bayer Inc. et  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Protonotaire
[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une requête en radiation de certaines parties de la demande, fondée sur l'alinéa 6(5)
b
) du
Règlement sur les médicaments brevetés (avis de conformité)
[le Règlement MBAC].
INTRODUCTION
[2]
L'instance sous-jacente est une demande présentée par les demanderesses Bayer Inc. et Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH [ci-après appelées collectivement « Bayer »] au titre du paragraphe 55.2(4) de la
Loi sur les brevets
et de l'article 6 du Règlement MBAC. Bayer veut obtenir une déclaration portant que la lettre datée du 8 avril 2014 que lui a adressée la défenderesse, Pharmaceutical Partners of Canada Inc. [PPC], ne constitue pas un avis d'allégation ni un énoncé détaillé aux fins du Règlement MBAC et qu'elle n'a aucun effet juridique. Subsidiairement, Bayer sollicite une ordonnance interdisant au ministre de la Santé de délivrer un avis de conformité à PPC relativement à son produit pour injection proposé, le chlorhydrate de moxifloxacine, et ce, jusqu'à l'expiration des trois brevets de Bayer, y compris le brevet canadien no 2 378 424 [le brevet 424].
[3]
PPC a demandé en application de l'alinéa 6(5)
b
) du Règlement MBAC une ordonnance radiant certaines parties de la demande de Bayer au motif que celle-ci est, pour autant qu'elle se rapporte au brevet 424, scandaleuse, frivole ou vexatoire ou qu'elle constitue autrement un abus de procédure. PPC soutient que la preuve soumise par Bayer ne peut tout simplement pas étayer une conclusion de contrefaçon directe ou d'incitation à la contrefaçon de sa part.
[4]
PPC n'a déposé aucune preuve à l'appui de sa requête et s'appuie seulement sur la preuve par affidavit signifiée par Bayer dans l'instance principale relative à la contrefaçon ou à l'incitation à la contrefaçon du brevet 424 et, plus particulièrement, sur les affidavits de deux experts, Mme Linda Dresser et le Dr Roland Grossman. Comme Bayer n'a déposé aucun autre élément de preuve en réponse à la requête et que ses deux déposants n'ont pas été contre-interrogés, les faits liés à la présente requête ne sont pas contestés.
LES FAITS
[5]
PPC a déposé une présentation abrégée de drogue nouvelle [PADN] afin d'obtenir un avis de conformité [AC] pour le chlorhydrate de moxifloxacine en solution pour injection intraveineuse qui sera commercialisé au Canada sous le nom de PPC-Moxifloxacin. PPC compare PPC-Moxifloxacin à AVELOXMD I.V., la version de Bayer du chlorhydrate de moxifloxacine en solution pour injection intraveineuse.
[6]
Trois brevets concernant AVELOXMD I.V. sont inscrits au registre des brevets, en l'occurrence, le brevet canadien no 1 340 114, le brevet canadien no 2 192 418 et le brevet 424. Comme je l'ai mentionné, la présente requête porte uniquement sur le brevet 424. Le brevet 424 est intitulé « composition de sel de cuisine à base de moxifloxacine ». Le brevet divulgue et revendique une formulation de moxifloxacine pour administration parentérale, dont une formulation pour administration intraveineuse. Les quarante-neuf revendications du brevet 424 requièrent l'ajout de moxifloxacine et de chlorure de sodium dans des concentrations précises.
[7]
La revendication indépendante 1 du brevet 424 vise en particulier:
Une formulation aqueuse composée de:
0,04 % à 0,4 % (p/v) de chlorhydrate de moxifloxacine, en fonction de la quantité de moxifloxacine,
0,4 % à 0,9 % (p/v) de chlorure de sodium.
[8]
PPC-Moxifloxacin XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Les ingrédients non médicinaux de PPC-Moxifloxacin sont les suivants: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
[9]
Mme Dresser, l'un des experts de Bayer, est une pharmacienne d'hôpital qui possède plus de 25 ans d'expérience. Elle sait comment administrer en concomitance AVELOXMD I.V. et les solutions de chlorure de sodium et a prodigué des recommandations aux médecins sur la façon de l'administrer. Le Dr Grossman, l'autre expert de Bayer, est un médecin faisant partie du personnel du Credit Valley Hospital et est professeur de médecine à l'Université de Toronto. Il est un expert de renommée mondiale sur l'utilisation des antibiotiques, dont le moxifloxacine, dans le traitement des infections respiratoires comme la pneumonie d'origine communautaire.
[10]
La preuve de Mme Dresser concerne l'interprétation du brevet 424 et de ses revendications. Mme Dresser a examiné la monographie de produit de PPC et fait la démonstration de la façon dont ce document pourrait être compris et utilisé. Elle fait observer que la monographie de produit indique que, dans le cadre d'une administration concomitante, PPC-Moxifloxacin est compatible avec les six mêmes solutions intraveineuses qu'AVELOXMD I.V.. L'extrait pertinent est rédigé comme suit:
Le moxifloxacine pour injection est compatible avec les solutions intraveineuses suivantes dans une proportion variant de 1:10 à 10:1:
• 0,9 % de chlorure de sodium pour injection, USP
• 1M chlorure de sodium pour injection
• 5 % de dextrose pour injection, USP
• Eau stérile pour injection, USP
• 10 % de dextrose pour injection, USP
• Lactate de Ringer pour injection
[11]
Mme Dresser et le Dr Grossman ont expliqué comment PPC-Moxifloxacin sera ou sera probablement utilisé et commercialisé si PPC obtient un AC pour PPC-Moxifloxacin. Selon Mme Dresser, pour vendre PPC-Moxifloxacin, PPC devra présenter des soumissions en vue de fournir les hôpitaux et voir à ce que ces hôpitaux stockent et administrent PPC-Moxifloxacin au lieu d'AVELOXMD I.V. Elle a affirmé que si PPC obtient un AC pour PPC-Moxifloxacin:
(a) PPC-Moxifloxacin et une solution saline de chlorure de sodium à 0,9 % seront administrés en concomitance dans une certaine proportion à l'aide d'un raccord
"Y"
.
(b) La formulation qui sera administrée aux patients contrefera certaines revendications du brevet 424.
(c) La formulation résultante administrée au patient contiendra de la moxifloxacine et du chlorure de sodium et contrefera les revendications 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 37, 38 et 49 du brevet 424.
[12]
Bayer a admis que rien n'indique que PPC contrefait directement le brevet 424. Elle affirme, toutefois, que les professionnels de la santé contreferont le brevet 424 en conséquence directe des renseignements que PPC communiquera dans sa monographie de produit et de ses tentatives à faire remplacer AVELOXMD I.V. par PPC-Moxifloxacin.
[13]
L'avocat de Bayer a convenu durant l'audition de la requête que la preuve concernant l'incitation à la contrefaçon par PPC se résume au paragraphe 42 de l'affidavit de Mme Dresser, qui se lit comme suit:
[traduction] Compte tenu de la monographie de produit de PPC, si le produit de PPC était vendu au Canada, en tant que pharmacien, j'informerais les médecins que le produit de PPC peut être prescrit, utilisé et administré de la même manière qu'AVELOXMD I.V. Donc, à mon avis, selon les directives des monographies de produit de PPC, les médecins prescriraient et utiliseraient le produit de PPC de la même manière qu'AVELOXMD I.V., notamment l'administration en concomitance du produit de PPC et d'une solution saline normale dans les contextes pour lesquels le médecin traitant établit que ce produit est recommandé.
[14]
PPC fait valoir que, dans le meilleur des cas, la preuve produite par Bayer ne peut absolument pas établir de contrefaçon directe ni d'incitation à la contrefaçon du brevet 424 par PPC, et que la demande, dans la mesure où elle se rapporte au brevet 424, devrait être rejetée.
ANALYSE
[15]
La présente requête a été instituée par PPC, la seconde personne au sens du Règlement MBAC, au titre de l'alinéa 6(5)
b
), qui prévoit:
6. (5) Sous réserve du paragraphe (5.1), lors de l'instance relative à la demande visée au paragraphe (1), le tribunal peut, sur requête de la seconde personne, rejeter tout ou partie de la demande si, selon le cas ...
b) il conclut qu'elle est inutile, scandaleuse, frivole ou vexatoire ou constitue autrement, à l'égard d'un ou plusieurs brevets, un abus de procédure.
6. (5) Subject to subsection (5.1), in a proceeding in respect of an application under subsection (1), the court may, on the motion of a second person, dismiss the application in whole or in part ...
(b) on the ground that it is redundant, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious or is otherwise an abuse of process in respect of one or more patents.
[16]
L'objet du paragraphe 6(5) est de permettre à la Cour de statuer rapidement sur les demandes sans fondement présentées par des premières personnes n'ayant aucune d'avoir gain de cause à l'audience. Les parties conviennent que le rejet d'une demande au titre de l'alinéa 6(5)
b
) est un redressement extraordinaire qui ne sera accordé que si la demande est « manifestement futile » ou qu'il est « évident et manifeste » qu'elle n'a aucune chance d'être accueillie:

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[17]
La seconde personne peut demander le rejet de la demande de la première personne en vertu de l'alinéa 6(5)
b
) au motif que la preuve par affidavit présentée par cette dernière ne suffit pas à prouver que les allégations de contrefaçon de la seconde personne sont injustifiées:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 13. Pour rendre une telle décision, le juge des requêtes doit pouvoir tirer les conclusions de fait nécessaires, en les considérant de la manière la plus favorable à la première personne, et appliquer le droit aux faits.
[18]
La requête en rejet ne sera accueillie que s'il est évident qu'il n'existe aucune cause défendable, eu égard au fond de la demande. La démarche de la Cour ne doit ressembler en rien à l'instruction de l'action liée aux affidavits contradictoires pour évaluer la solidité de la thèse de chaque partie.
Incitation
[19]
Bayer n'a produit aucune preuve qui établisse ni même suggère que PPC contreferait directement le brevet 424. Ledit brevet revendique une formulation contenant de la moxifloxacine et du chlorure de sodium selon certaines concentrations spécifiées. Mme Dresser reconnaît dans son affidavit que XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX, il n'y a donc aucune contrefaçon directe par PPC. Bayer soutient plutôt que PPC incitera ou aidera d'autres à contrefaire le brevet 424.
[20]
Bayer soutient que la preuve établit clairement que la monographie de produit de PPC incite à la contrefaçon du brevet 424 et que la vente de PPC-Moxifloxacin entraînera la contrefaçon du brevet 424.
[21]
Selon Mme Dresser, le produit de PPC sera administré en concomitance avec une solution saline à base de chlorure de sodium à 0,9 % dans les proportions indiquées dans le brevet 424 si un avis de conformité est délivré pour le produit de PPC et que PPC commercialise le produit pour qu'il soit utilisé conformément à la monographie de produit.
[22]
D'après Bayer, sa preuve démontre que:
(a) l'utilisation de PPC-Moxifloxacin contrefera le brevet 424;
(b) cette contrefaçon sera la conséquence directe des renseignements que PPC a communiqués dans sa monographie de produit et du fait que PPC cherche à faire prescrire PPC-Moxifloxacin à la place d'AVELOXMD I.V. de Bayer;
(c) PPC a communiqué ces renseignements en sachant que la contrefaçon du brevet 454 est une conséquence inévitable.
[23]
Il est bien établi qu'il n'y a pas de contrefaçon de brevet par la vente d'un article qui ne le contrefait pas en soi, même lorsque le vendeur sait que l'acheteur acquiert l'article afin de l'utiliser pour contrefaire le brevet;

Il ne suffit pas d'affirmer que les pharmaciens ou les médecins prescriront PPC-Moxifloxacin d'une manière équivalant à de la contrefaçon pour établir de ce fait l'incitation. Ce sont les actes de la seconde personne qui sont en cause, et non les actes de contrefaçon posés par des tiers, comme l'a conclu la juge Mactavish dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 369:
367
S'appuyant sur les considérations qui précèdent, les demanderesses soutiennent qu'en raison de la nature du marché canadien de la mémantine, une contrefaçon du brevet 492 est inévitable, car la mémantine sera prescrite par les médecins, délivrée par les pharmaciens et utilisée par les patients dans le cadre d'une bithérapie.
368
C'est fort possible. En effet, la preuve circonstancielle semble indiquer que le produit ratio-MEMANTINE de Ratiopharm peut finir par être utilisé en association avec des inhibiteurs de l'acétylcholinestérase pour le traitement de la maladie d'Alzheimer, ce qui contreferait le brevet 492. Ratiopharm peut s'attendre à ce qu'une telle éventualité se produise. Ce sont cependant les actes et non les attentes de Ratiopharm qui sont en litige en l'espèce.
369
Les parties s'entendent sur le fait que la possibilité de contrefaçon en aval ne suffit pas, en soi, à établir la contrefaçon par incitation. Comme l'a fait observer la juge Gauthier dans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. (4th) 161, même s'il peut être établi que la contrefaçon du fait d'autres personnes « est très probable, sinon inévitable », cette preuve ne sera pas suffisante pour établir qu'une allégation de non-contrefaçon n'est pas justifiée: voir le paragraphe 31.
[25]
La seconde personne peut participer à la contrefaçon d'un brevet par d'autres personnes si elle incite à cette contrefaçon. Le critère relatif à l'incitation a été établi par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 162. Premièrement, l'acte de contrefaçon doit avoir été exécuté par le contrefacteur direct. Deuxièmement, l'exécution de l'acte de contrefaçon doit avoir été influencée par les agissements du présumé incitateur de sorte que, sans cette influence, la contrefaçon directe n'aurait pas eu lieu. Troisièmement, l'influence doit avoir été exercée sciemment par le vendeur, autrement dit le vendeur doit savoir que son influence entraînera l'exécution de l'acte de contrefaçon.
[26]
Le critère relatif à l'incitation est conjonctif, ce qui veut dire que Bayer doit en établir les trois éléments pour que sa demande soit accueillie. L'avocat de PPC fait valoir que les déposants de Bayer ne fournissent aucune preuve de l'influence que PPC aurait exercée et qui aurait entraîné l'exécution de l'acte de contrefaçon du brevet 424, délibérément ou autrement, et qu'il est donc évident et manifeste que la demande ne peut être accueillie relativement au brevet 424.
[27]
PPC affirme dans sa monographie de produit que PPC-Moxifloxacin peut être utilisé sans danger avec le chlorure de sodium et administré en séquence avec une solution contenant du chlorure de sodium. La monographie de produit précise aussi que la dilution de PPC-Moxifloxacin dans une autre solution (dont, probablement, des solutions de chlorure de sodium) n'est pas nécessaire. Compte tenu de ces déclarations, Mme Dresser est d'avis que les médecins pourraient prescrire, utiliser et administrer PPC-Moxifloxacin de la même manière qu'AVELOXMD I.V. [traduction] « comme il est indiqué dans la monographie de produit de PPC ».
[28]
À mon avis, eu égard à la preuve présentée à la Cour, Bayer n'a aucune chance raisonnable de succès pour ce qui est du second volet du critère de l'incitation énoncé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La condition voulant que l'incitateur présumé influence le contrefacteur direct est un élément constitutif de l'incitation. Rien dans la monographie de PPC ne peut établir que PPC contrefera le brevet 424 en incitant d'autres à la contrefaçon.
[29]
La contrefaçon par incitation peut être établie au moyen d'inférences raisonnablement tirées du contenu de la monographie du médicament générique, ou par des éléments de preuve liés à la forme posologique du produit générique, à son étiquetage ou à sa mise en marché:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 399. Le problème avec la preuve présentée par Bayer est qu'il n'existe aucun fait, en dehors de l'opinion de Mme Dresser, pour étayer la conclusion suivant laquelle PPC [traduction] « donne des directives » à d'autres pour contrefaire le brevet 424. La question de savoir si la monographie de PPC donne effectivement de telles directives est une affaire de fait et non d'opinion. Qu'un expert aide la Cour à interpréter des termes techniques est une chose, qu'il émette une opinion sur la question même que la Cour est appelée à trancher en est une tout autre.
[30]
Il convient de rappeler que PPC demande un avis de conformité qui l'autoriserait à mettre sur le marché et à vendre son propre produit sans contrefaçon. PPC n'a pas encore procédé à cette mise en marché. Aucune preuve n'indique que PPC cherchera à vendre son produit en combinaison avec du chlorure de sodium, sinon des hypothèses. Rien n'atteste non plus une tentative flagrante de sa part d'inciter ou d'encourager d'autres à contrefaire le brevet 424.
[31]
Il n'existe certainement ni instructions ni directives explicites liées à l'exécution d'un acte de contrefaçon du type de celles dont il était question dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> une « mention subtile » dans une monographie de produit peut suffire pour donner au lecteur l'impression qu'un médicament peut être utilisé d'une manière qui contreferait un brevet. Cependant, les renvois généraux et génériques au chlorure de sodium dans la monographie de produit de PPC ne constituent pas une incitation. Rien ne laisse croire que PPC-Moxifloxacin devrait remplacer AVELOXMD I.V. ou être utilisé de la même manière que ce dernier. La monographie de produit de PPC précise aussi en caractère gras que PPC-Moxifloxacin ne nécessite pas de dilution. La simple déclaration que PPC-Moxifloxacin peut être dilué sans danger avec l'une des six solutions pour administration intraveineuse, notamment le chlorure de sodium, ou qu'il peut être utilisé en séquence avec des solutions contenant du chlorure de sodium, sans plus, ne suffit pas à conclure que PPC incite sciemment les professionnels de la santé à administrer en concomitance PPC-Moxifloxacin et le chlorure de sodium.
[33]
Bayer soutient que PPC a clairement l'intention que AVELOXMD I.V. soit remplacé par PPC-Moxifloxacin et que ce dernier soit administré aux patients de la même manière qu'AVELOXMD I.V, comme le prouve la façon dont PPC vendra son produit. Mme Dresser affirme qu'après que le produit de PPC sera mis sur le marché au Canada, PPC devra contacter les hôpitaux ou les grossistes pour les convaincre de fournir PPC-Moxifloxacin au lieu d'AVELOXMD I.V. Il ne s'agit que de simples conjectures et suppositions de Mme Dresser. Si PPC incite ou aide bel et bien une autre personne à contrefaire le brevet 424, Bayer disposera d'un recours en contrefaçon.
[34]
Il incombe à Bayer, dans le cadre de la demande principale, d'établir selon la prépondérance des probabilités que l'allégation de PPC selon laquelle elle n'incitera pas d'autres à contrefaire le brevet 424 est injustifiée. PPC a établi, compte tenu du dossier dont je dispose, qu'il est évident et manifeste que Bayer n'a aucune chance raisonnable de démontrer qu'elle contrefait ou qu'elle incitera d'autres à contrefaire le brevet 424. Comme le critère relatif à l'incitation est conjonctif, et que Bayer n'a produit aucune preuve susceptible de satisfaire à ses trois volets, je conclus que la demande d'interdiction, dans la mesure où elle se rapporte au brevet 424, est inévitablement vouée à l'échec. À ce titre, elle est « vexatoire » au sens du paragraphe 6(5) du Règlement MBAC.
CONCLUSION
[35]
Pour les motifs qui précèdent, je conclus que la requête en radiation de certaines parties de la demande relative au brevet 424, fondée sur l'alinéa 6(5)
b
) du Règlement MBAC, devrait être accueillie.
[36]
Les avocats ont convenu que des dépens fixés à un montant de 5 000 $ devraient être adjugés à la partie qui aurait pleinement gain de cause relativement à la requête. Dans les circonstances, les dépens doivent être adjugés à PPC au montant convenu.
ORDONNANCE
[37]
