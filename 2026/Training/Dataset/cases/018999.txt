[1]
Noël, J.
: This is an application for judicial review under section 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated July 19, 2012, granting the Respondent refugee status.
I.
Facts
[2]
The Respondent is a Tamil male from Sri Lanka who arrived in Canada on August 10, 2010 on the
MV Sun Sea
.
[3]
The Respondent was displaced within Sri Lanka in [redacted] and [redacted] until the Sri Lankan Army [SLA] gained control over Jaffna.
[4]
The Respondent completed his university studies in [redacted] and started working in [redacted] in Jaffna. [Redacted].
[5]
On [redacted], the [redacted] interrogated. The officers [redacted] Respondent was detained [redacted] and tortured. A [redacted].
[6]
[Redacted].
[7]
[Redacted]. He obtained a passport and [redacted] paid for his ticket to Thailand. While in Thailand, he met an agent and made arrangements to take a trip to Canada on the
MV Sun Sea
.
II.
Decision under review
[8]
The RPD found that the Respondent did not have a well-founded fear of persecution when he left Sri Lanka because of credibility issues. The RPD determined that it was implausible that the [redacted] and that he omitted important information in his Personal Information Form. The RPD also found it implausible that the Respondent applied for a passport and was able to leave the country, despite there being stringent security checks in place in Sri Lanka at the time, particularly for those suspected of having ties to the LTTE. Therefore, the RPD concluded that the Respondent cannot be found to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the sole basis that he is a Tamil from the north of Sri Lanka.
[9]
The RPD however found that the Respondent has a valid
sur place
claim. Indeed, the RPD determined that the Sri Lankan government suspects the
MV Sun Sea
to be linked to the LTTE and that passengers returning to Sri Lanka would be subjected to questioning. Relying on the documentary evidence, which establishes that Sri Lankan authorities use torture as a mean of securing information, the RPD concluded that the Respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution.
[10]
The RPD reviewed a number of documentary evidence on human rights abuse by the government of Sri Lanka and determined that the Respondent faced a risk as a former passenger of the
MV Sun Sea
. This finding was based on the human rights reports of several international organizations and the United States Department of State Report, which also claim that the widespread use of torture has not abated since the civil war, and that the anti-terrorism legislative regime in Sri Lanka continues to provide structures enabling human rights violations with impunity.
[11]
On the issue of nexus to a Convention ground under section 96 of the IRPA, the RPD concluded that being a passenger on a ship alone is not sufficient to establish nexus and that there are "mixed motives" on the part of the agent of persecution. The Respondent's Tamil ethnicity was considered to be a contributing factor to the risk he would face should he return to Sri Lanka.
[12]
The evidence is clear that the Respondent would be questioned by Sri Lankan authorities upon his return to Sri Lanka and that his status as a former
MV Sun Sea
passenger would become known.
[13]
The evidence also establishes that the Sri Lankan government perceives the
MV Sun Sea
to be part of an LTTE-administered trafficking operation, regardless of the Respondent's previous perceived association with the LTTE.
[14]
As for Sri Lankan authorities' treatment of returnees, there is evidence that they use torture and abusive force against suspected terrorists and also against those who may have information about suspected terrorists. The Respondent would therefore face more than a mere possibility of being persecuted as a Tamil who traveled on the
MV Sun Sea
.
[15]
As for state protection, the RPD concluded that the Sri Lankan Government itself is a potential agent of persecution, and that there is no ability to report abuses to the state. The RPD also determined that the Respondent does not have an internal flight alternative available to him as government agents would be able to locate him in Colombo.
III.
Applicant's submissions
[16]
The Applicant first submits that the RPD erred in determining that the Respondent's fear has a nexus to a Convention ground. In the present case, the RPD's reasons for its nexus finding are not intelligible or transparent as it is not clear which of the five grounds is engaged. Moreover, the Respondent's situation should not have been characterized as a case of mixed motives as the RPD did not determine that the Respondent would be targeted because of his ethnicity. The RPD's decision to grant refugee protection on the basis that the Respondent's ethnicity is a contributing factor to his risk is contrary to the principles established in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) (36), Russell J [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] as ethnicity should be an independent basis for the persecution.
[17]
Second, the Applicant submits that the RPD erred in determining that the Respondent is part of a particular social group that is targeted as he was a passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
and therefore suspected of being linked to the LTTE. Choosing to travel aboard an illegal human smuggling operation has nothing to do with the defence of human rights and is unrelated to the anti-discrimination and human right purpose of the Convention as established in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 177, Crampton CJ [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[18]
Third, the Applicant submits that the RPD's determination that the Sri Lankan authorities' perception that the Respondent has information on the LTTE might amount to a perceived political opinion is unreasonable. Indeed, even if the Sri Lankan authorities might question the Respondent, there is no evidentiary basis for a finding that he will be deemed to share the political opinions of the LTTE. Information about criminal activity is not a political opinion within the meaning of the grounds for refugee protection.
[19]
Finally, the Applicant concludes that the RPD committed an error as it did not state that the Respondent has established the facts underlying his claim on a balance of probabilities. Moreover, it came to an unreasonable conclusion because its finding that the Respondent would face a risk of persecution is based on evidence that is out of date and there is no reliable evidence as to the treatment of
MV Sun Sea
passengers who returned to Sri Lanka.
IV.
Respondent's submissions
[20]
The Respondent submits that the reasons provided by the RPD with respect to nexus to a Convention ground are intelligible and transparent. It has been recognized that mixed motives of persecution may form the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution. Nexus is established when at least one of the motives is based on a Convention ground. In the present case, the RPD concluded that "the claimant's Tamil ethnicity is a contributing factor to his risk." It has been established in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 1270 (FCA), Hugessen JA [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] as well as in other case law from this Court that when a person faces risk because he belongs to a group, one of whose defining characteristics is race, then that person has a nexus to a Convention ground. As it has been recognized that Tamils from the north of Sri Lanka are a particular social group, in addition to the nexus of race, it is reasonable to conclude that Tamils from Sri Lanka who travelled on the
MV Sun Sea
also meet this definition. As for the decision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, cited by the Applicant, the Respondent submits that the reasoning in the decision ignores who the passengers of the
MV Sun Sea
are and that the reasons why they came together in the first place was to escape the denial of their human rights. The RPD reasonably found that the Respondent would be at risk of torture, a mean used by Sri Lankan authorities to secure information on terrorist activities.
[21]
The Respondent further submits that the Applicant's reliance on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above is misplaced as this case does not stand for the proposition that the race element must be sufficient to put the Respondent at risk, regardless of other aspects of the case, and that it is therefore distinguishable from the case at bar.
[22]
The Respondent submits that the debate on whether, in addition to nexus on the basis of race and particular social group, the Respondent also has a nexus on the basis of "perceived political opinion" is academic as the RPD determined that he would face persecution on the basis of his Tamil ethnicity and found his presence on the
MV Sun Sea
to be an additional risk factor. Moreover, the Government of Sri Lanka clearly indicated that it considers the
MV Sun Sea
to be a human smuggling operation organized by the LTTE. Whether the Respondent is perceived as an LTTE supporter or simply as having information on the LTTE, he is at greater risk than other refugee returnees. Therefore, the RPD's decision on nexus is reasonable.
[23]
Finally, the Respondent submits that the evidence relied on by the RPD was not out of date. As an example, it considered a declaration by the Sri Lankan government that was made a month before the hearing. Moreover, contrary to what is alleged by the Applicant, there is evidence about a returnee who was a passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
. He was detained upon arrival and tortured. The RPD is entitled to consider evidence of similarly situated claimants such as a case where Sri Lankan nationals who fled to Australia were tortured while detained in Boosa upon their return to Sri Lanka. The RPD reasonably found that evidence such as in cases where there is monitoring by international governmental agents, Sri Lankan authorities pay attention to standards of procedure does not solve the issue of what happens to returnees who do not benefit from this level of protection. Considering human rights abuses in Sri Lanka, it is reasonable to determine that returnees who do not benefit from this monitoring process are at risk. The Respondent submits that the RPD's conclusion that he is at risk of being tortured if returned to Sri Lanka is reasonable.
V.
Applicant's reply
[24]
The Applicant submits that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above should be distinguished from the present case because in that case, the RPD did not find that the Applicant's race was a causal factor and that case was decided over twenty years ago.
[25]
Second, the Applicant argues that the RPD disregarded the evidence before it that Tamils do not face persecution by reason of their ethnicity anymore.
[26]
The Applicant further submits that some evidence was ignored by the RPD. Indeed, the RPD dismissed evidence showing that many returnees from abroad were able to resettle in the country without encountering significant difficulties but speculated that this would not apply in the Respondent's case as he was a passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
. The Applicant is of the view that the RPD's reliance on an outdated and unclear evidence of Boosa detainees is insufficient to meet the threshold to establish more than a mere possibility of risk.
[27]
Finally, the Applicant is of the view that the RPD does not rely on evidence demonstrating that the authorities use torture with cooperative witnesses. Nothing in the RPD's analysis indicates that the Respondent would be unwilling to provide information to Sri Lankan authorities. This Court found in two decisions: (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CarswellNat 206, Snider J and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CarswellNat 207, Snider J.) that although returnees who traveled on the
MV Sun Sea
would be subjected to questioning upon return, such evidence is insufficient to establish that these particular returnees would be persecuted or tortured.
VI.
Issues
1. Is the RPD's finding that the Respondent is a Convention refugee based on an established nexus to a Convention ground unreasonable?
2. Did the RPD apply a wrong standard of proof to its findings of fact by basing critical elements of its decision on speculation and outdated, unclear evidence?
VII.
Standard of review
[28]
Both parties agree that the standard of reasonableness applies to both issues as they raise mixed question of fact and law (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). I agree. When assessing the reasonableness of a decision, a Court looks for justification, evidentiary foundation and understandable reasoning. As for the conclusion arrived at by the administrative body, a Court needs to consider whether it falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the applicable law (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paras 47-48).
VIII.
Statutory provision
[29]
Section 96 of the IRPA reads as follows:
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27
Convention Refugee
96.
A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, ch 27
Définition de « réfugié »
96.
A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:

) soit se trouve hors de tout pays don't elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
IX.
Analysis
[30]
The RPD's determination based on section 96 of the IRPA reads as follows:
I find, on the evidence before me in this claim that various factors combine to demonstrate more than a mere possibility that the claimant faces treatment constituting persecution upon his return to Sri Lanka because he is a Tamil who was a passenger on the
Sun Sea
. (See para 26 of the decision.)
[31]
Before coming to this conclusion, the Board member made a number of successive detailed findings as her analysis shows, the most relevant points of which are summarized as follows
:
The Board member found that all Tamils in Sri Lanka still face state-sponsored discrimination but that Tamil ethnicity alone was not a sufficient ground to establish a serious possibility of persecution. In the RPD's view, it was a contributing factor to be considered along with other relevant components. It is important to note that in its decision, the RPD referred to the Respondent's Tamil ethnicity on numerous occasions to highlight the fact that it was a contributing factor to the risk of persecution as well as an aggravating consideration in the treatment he may get upon return at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities. The RPD noted that his Tamil ethnicity needs to be considered along with the fact that the Sri Lankan government may draw conclusions regarding his political opinions based on his status as a former passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
.
The Board member found that the Respondent's presence on the
MV Sun Sea
was a factor that added to the risk of persecution.
The Board member also found that the Respondent would be questioned by government authorities upon return. The RPD determined that he would have to explain how he left Sri Lanka and that as a result of this, his status as a former passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
would become known to the authorities.
The decision maker, after explaining how the Sri Lanka government perceives the
MV Sun Sea
and links it to an LTTE operation, found that there is a serious possibility that the Respondent who was a passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
, would face persecution at the time of arrival or after even though he does not have a past which relates him to the LTTE. Because of the attitude of the government towards the
MV Sun Sea
, associating it to the LTTE, the perception of the authorities would be that he is linked to or has potentially valuable information on this group and its role in the smuggling operation.
The RPD also considered the evidence to the effect that returnees are treated poorly upon return and that torture is a technique of questioning frequently used by government authorities in Sri Lanka.
[32]
The cumulative effect of these findings led the RPD to identify race (Tamil ethnicity) and the Respondent's status as a former
MV Sun Sea
passenger as contributing factors of risk of persecution. Through the doctrine of mixed motives, the RPD determined that race and status as a former passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
, which is perceived by the Sri Lankan government to be a LTTE-driven operation, would trigger a risk of persecution at the hands of the agents of persecution upon his return. Moreover, in its decision, the RPD explained that the Respondent will be perceived as having information on the LTTE, as he travelled on the MV Sun Sea, which is considered by the Sri Lankan authorities to be LTTE-driven. As such the Board member found that there is a serious possibility that the Respondent would be persecuted.
[33]
The Applicant submits that the Respondent's potential knowledge about the LTTE is insufficient to establish a nexus based on political opinions as a claimant who fears persecution because he is perceived as having information about an organization as opposed to sharing the political views of that organization does not have a nexus to the Convention ground of "political opinion."
[34]
Such argument cannot be accepted. In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Blanchard, J, a case dealing with a similar issue, this Court stated the following regarding the RPD's finding regarding imputed knowledge about the LTTE:
[21] The RPD's findings are not as clear as they could have been and in some cases arguably deficient. For instance, the RPD could not rely upon imputed
knowledge
of LTTE activities to support its finding of imputed political opinion. I am nevertheless satisfied that the evidence referred to by the Tribunal in its reasons supports a finding that the Respondent, as a young, Tamil male from northern Sri Lanka, has a well-founded fear of persecution by reasons of his race and his imputed political opinion by reason of his perceived
association
with the LTTE. I am satisfied that that the RPD's conclusion is reasonable.
[35]
In its decision, the RPD made it clear that the basis for its finding that the Respondent would be at risk of persecution is based in part on his status as a former passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
, which is associated to the LTTE by the Sri Lankan authorities, as shown by the statement by the Defence Secretary. There is therefore a sufficient basis to conclude that there is a nexus to political opinion as he would be perceived as being associated to the LTTE.
[36]
The Applicant further argues that the RPD's finding that the Respondent's Tamil ethnicity in combination with other factors was, sufficient to create a valid nexus to a Convention ground pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA is unreasonable as it is not a determination of mixed motives based on ethnicity but rather an erroneous conclusion that passengers on the
MV Sun Sea
have a nexus to a Convention ground. It is submitted that in order to be successful in establishing mixed motives of persecution, one of the motives must be connected to a Convention ground. The Applicant argues that as the Board member did not connect Tamil ethnicity as such, to a Convention ground, there cannot be a nexus established pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.
[37]
I disagree with such a limited interpretation of the doctrine of mixed motives which goes against the spirit of the Convention. Section 96 of the IRPA has one objective which is to prevent people from being subjected to persecution as long as it is linked to a Convention ground. If one of the motivations of the agent of persecution is race but only in combination with another factor, how could that not be sufficient to meet the requirements of section 96 of the IRPA? After all, section 96 of the IRPA as written, is not to be interpreted in a narrow restrictive fashion: its purpose, as outlined, is to address fear of persecution and to protect any person who suffers from persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Moreover, section 3(2)(d) of the IRPA clearly states that one of the main purposes of Canada's refugee system is to "offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment." Section 96 of the IRPA needs to be interpreted in light of this objective.
[38]
The mixed motives approach to a finding related to section 96 of the IRPA is not new. The Federal Court of Appeal has been recognizing the validity of this type of analysis for more than 20 years. Indeed, in both
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), Décary JA and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Federal Court of Appeal recognized that race can be a "causal factor" when an individual is at risk to suffer persecution at the hands of state agents and that this causal factor, considered along with other motivations can establish a serious possibility of persecution:
In our view, it is obvious beyond any need of demonstration that if a person faces "real and oppressive" risks, including a risk of "substantial violence," from state sponsored sources (the IPKF) because he or she belongs to a group one of whose defining characteristics is race, (young Tamil males), it is simply impossible to say that such person does not have an objective fear of persecution for reasons of race.
(See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at 2.)
It is not a question of whether the persecution can be connected to a Convention ground but rather an issue of whether a ground such as race can be a contributing or causal factor.
[39]
The notion of mixed motives in the context of refugee protection claims was first recognized in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CarswellNat 1600 (FCA), MacGuigan JA when the Federal Court of Appeal noted that: "People frequently act out of mixed motives, and it is enough for the existence of political motivation that one of the motives [be] political."
[40]
From then on, this Court has applied the mixed motives approach to many decisions under section 96 of the IRPA. For example, a mixed motives finding based on race and age as a contributing factor, was recognized as a valid basis for a Convention ground in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 221, McKeown J. Moreover, mixed motives have also been associated with the perception of state agents of situations and their motives when assessing those situations. In a 2003 case, this Court noted that political opinions that an applicant "had or might have been imputed to [him] by government authority" may constitute the basis of a finding of mixed motives (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 126, Martineau J.). In another decision of this Court, it was noted that if at least one of the motives can be related to a Convention ground, nexus may be established (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 140, Teitelbaum J.).
[41]
More recently, this Court addressed the issue of mixed motives when it recognized that a motive can be not considered "purely" economic if the evidence indicates that there was a racial component to it. Mixed motives may then be found if one of the motives is related to a Convention ground (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (4th) 113, Zinn J.).
[42]
Counsel for the Applicant relies on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above to argue that racially motivated acts constitute persecution only if, taken individually, they are sufficient to establish a Convention ground. Respectfully, this is not my interpretation of this decision, to my mind, it was determined that if it had been considered that based on the evidence, there was a racial component to what the claimant suffered, a finding of "mixed motivation" could have been "conceivably possible" but such was not the case.
[...] I agree with respondent's counsel that such mixed motivation is conceivably possible. What is lacking in the present case, in my view, is objective evidence that the attacks, at least in part, were made to persecute the respondent for being white. [...]
(See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 129.)
[43]
Therefore, it was a matter of sufficiency of the evidence on the racial motivation. If the racial component of the assault had been demonstrated, then mixed motives on the part of the aggressor could have been established and race may have been found to be a contributing factor to the main motivation which was to rob the Applicant.
[44]
The RPD found that the Respondent's Tamil ethnicity was a contributing and aggravating factor to the risk of persecution he faces should he return to Sri Lanka. The Board member found that this established a nexus to a Convention ground in conjunction with the fact that he was a passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
, which is perceived by the Sri Lankan government as a LTTE-driven operation. I consider this nexus finding to be reasonable and in line with the historical view of the mixed motives doctrine adopted by both the Federal Court of Appeal and this Court.
[45]
In order to come to this conclusion, the Respondent's Tamil ethnicity was a prime contributing factor to the possibility of risk of persecution upon arrival in Sri Lanka. When considered individually, the motivations, which are based on the Respondent's Tamil ethnicity as well as his status as a former passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
, which is perceived by the government as a LTTE-driven operation, were not sufficient to establish a nexus to the Convention ground of race on their own, however, when taken together they cumulatively established a serious possibility of risk of persecution upon return. Without one of the contributing factors, the Convention ground would not be satisfactorily established but taken together, these motivations form the basis of the ground of race. Therefore, the nexus to race was essential to the RPD's conclusion that the risk of persecution upon return was a serious scenario to be envisaged.
[46]
As a second argument, the Applicant submits that the findings of fact made regarding the Sri Lankan government's perception of the
MV Sun Sea
as a LTTE-related operation, its determination that the Respondent, as a former passenger of the
MV Sun Sea
would be subjected to questioning and that such status would become known to the authorities and its determination that there is evidence of torture of returnees by government agents were not done in accordance with the evidence submitted or assessed on a balance of probabilities.
[47]
The decision under review is very well-written. It was meticulously drafted, well researched and is in conformity with the applicable law and jurisprudence. It is certainly a reasonable decision, as it falls within "a range of possible, acceptable outcomes" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47).
[48]
The review of the documentary evidence on all matters including the attitude of the Sri Lanka government towards Sri Lankan returnees, its use of torture, its perception of the
MV Sun Sea
including the most recent statement by the Defence Secretary that the voyage of the
MV Sun Sea
is an example of the LTTE's international shipping criminal operations to smuggle people to western countries which is used to raise money for the separatist cause was well done, balanced and the conclusions arrived at were well justified. I do not find any speculation done by the RPD in its assessment of the evidence nor do I find that any of its findings was based on outdated or unclear evidence. The Applicant disagrees with the RPD's determinations and would like this Court to review the evidence and come to a different result. The RPD's findings were reasonable and the intervention of this Court is therefore not warranted.

.
II.
La décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[8]
En raison de problèmes de crédibilité, la SPR a conclu que le défendeur ne craignait pas avec raison d'être persécuté lorsqu'il a quitté le Sri Lanka. Elle a conclu qu'il était invraisemblable que le [caviardé] et qu'il avait omis des renseignements importants dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels. La SPR a également conclu qu'il était invraisemblable que le défendeur ait présenté une demande de passeport et ait pu quitter le pays, malgré les contrôles de sécurité rigoureux en place au Sri Lanka à ce moment-là, plus particulièrement à l'égard de ceux qui étaient soupçonnés d'avoir des liens avec les TLET. Par conséquent, la SPR a conclu qu'il n'était pas possible de déclarer que le défendeur craignait avec raison d'être persécuté pour le seul motif qu'il était un Tamoul du Nord du Sri Lanka.
[9]
La SPR a cependant conclu que la demande d'asile sur place présentée par le défendeur était fondée. En effet, elle a conclu que le gouvernement du Sri Lanka soupçonne le MS
Sun Sea
d'avoir des liens avec les TLET et que les passagers retournant au Sri Lanka seraient soumis à des interrogatoires. S'appuyant sur la preuve documentaire, qui établit que les autorités sri-lankaises ont recours à la torture pour obtenir des renseignements, la SPR a conclu que le défendeur craignait avec raison d'être persécuté.
[10]
La SPR a examiné plusieurs éléments de preuve documentaire relatifs à la violation des droits de la personne par le gouvernement du Sri Lanka et a conclu que le défendeur était exposé à un risque à titre d'ancien passager du MS
Sun Sea
. Cette conclusion était fondée sur les rapports sur les droits de la personne de plusieurs organismes internationaux et du rapport du département d'État des États-Unis, qui soutiennent également que l'utilisation répandue de la torture n'a pas diminué depuis la guerre civile et que le régime législatif antiterroriste en vigueur au Sri Lanka contient toujours des mécanismes qui permettent de violer les droits de la personne avec impunité.
[11]
En ce qui concerne la question du lien avec un motif prévu par la Convention au sens de l'article 96 de la LIPR, la SPR a conclu que le simple fait d'être un passager à bord d'un navire n'était pas suffisant pour établir un lien et qu'il y avait une possibilité de « motifs mixtes » de la part de l'agent de persécution. La SPR a estimé que l'origine tamoule du défendeur constituait un facteur qui contribuait au risque auquel il serait exposé s'il devait retourner au Sri Lanka.
[12]
Il ressort clairement de la preuve que les autorités sri-lankaises interrogeraient le défendeur à son retour au Sri Lanka et que son statut à titre d'ancien passager du MS
Sun Sea
serait découvert.
[13]
La preuve établit également que le gouvernement du Sri Lanka considère que le MS
Sun Sea
a été utilisé dans le cadre d'une opération de trafic de personnes orchestrée par les TLET, indépendamment des soupçons de liens antérieurs du défendeur avec les TLET.
[14]
En ce qui concerne la façon dont les autorités sri-lankaises traitent les rapatriés, la preuve indique qu'elles ont recours à la torture et à la force déraisonnable à l'endroit des personnes soupçonnées de terrorisme, de même qu'à l'endroit de celles qui pourraient avoir des renseignements concernant des personnes soupçonnées de terrorisme. Le défendeur serait donc exposé à plus qu'une simple possibilité d'être persécuté à titre de Tamoul qui avait pris place à bord du MS
Sun Sea
.
[15]
En ce qui a trait à la protection de l'État, la SPR a conclu que le gouvernement du Sri Lanka lui-même est un agent potentiel de persécution et qu'il n'y a aucune possibilité de signaler les violations à l'État. La SPR a également conclu que le défendeur n'avait pas de possibilité de refuge intérieur, car les agents du gouvernement seraient en mesure de le retrouver à Colombo.
III.
Observations du demandeur
[16]
Le demandeur soutient premièrement que la SPR a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que la crainte du défendeur avait un lien avec un motif prévu par la Convention. En l'espèce, les motifs de la SPR concernant la conclusion qu'elle a tirée quant aux liens ne sont ni intelligibles ni transparents, car il ne ressort pas clairement de ceux-ci lequel des cinq motifs prévus par la Convention est visé. De plus, la situation du défendeur ne devrait pas avoir été qualifiée comme un cas de motifs mixtes puisque la SPR n'a pas conclu que le défendeur serait ciblé en raison de son origine ethnique. La décision de la SPR d'accorder l'asile au motif que l'origine ethnique du défendeur était un facteur qui contribuait au risque auquel il était exposé est contraire aux principes établis dans
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) (36), au paragraphe 129 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] (motifs du juge Russell), selon lesquels l'origine ethnique devrait être un facteur indépendant de persécution.
[17]
Deuxièmement, le demandeur soutient que la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant que le défendeur appartenait à un groupe social qui est ciblé puisqu'il était un passager du MS
Sun Sea
et qu'il était par conséquent soupçonné d'avoir des liens avec les TLET. Le choix de voyager dans le cadre d'une opération illégale de passage de clandestins n'a rien à voir avec la défense des droits de la personne et n'a aucun lien avec l'objet de la Convention qui vise la lutte contre la discrimination et la défense des droits de la personne comme l'a établi
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 177 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], motifs du juge en chef Crampton.
[18]
Troisièmement, le demandeur fait valoir que la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la perception des autorités sri-lankaises voulant que le défendeur possède des renseignements sur les TLET pourrait constituer des opinions politiques présumées est déraisonnable. En effet, même si les autorités sri-lankaises interrogeaient le défendeur, aucun élément de preuve ne permet de conclure qu'il sera réputé partager les opinions politiques des TLET. Des renseignements concernant des activités criminelles ne constituent pas des opinions politiques au sens des motifs invoqués pour demander l'asile.
[19]
Enfin, le demandeur conclut que la SPR a commis une erreur parce qu'elle n'a pas déclaré que le défendeur avait établi, selon la prépondérance de la preuve, les faits sous-jacents à sa demande. De plus, la SPR a tiré une conclusion déraisonnable parce que sa conclusion selon laquelle le défendeur serait exposé à un risque de persécution est fondée sur des éléments de preuve périmés et il n'y a aucun élément de preuve fiable concernant le traitement des passagers du MS
Sun Sea
qui sont retournés au Sri Lanka.
IV.
Observations du défendeur
[20]
Le défendeur soutient que les motifs qu'a fournis la SPR concernant le lien avec un motif prévu par la Convention sont intelligibles et transparents. Il a été reconnu que des motifs mixtes pouvaient constituer le bien-fondé d'une crainte d'être persécuté. Le lien est établi lorsqu'au moins une des motivations repose sur un motif prévu par la Convention. En l'espèce, la SPR a conclu que « l'origine tamoule du demandeur d'asile est un facteur qui contribue au risque auquel il est exposé ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 1270 (CAF) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], motifs du juge Hugessen, de même que d'autres décisions de la Cour ont établi que lorsqu'une personne est exposée à des risques parce qu'elle appartient à un groupe, dont l'une des caractéristiques déterminantes est la race, cette personne a un lien avec un motif prévu par la Convention. Comme il a été reconnu que les Tamouls du Nord du Sri Lanka constituent un groupe social, outre le lien de la race, il est raisonnable de conclure que les Tamouls du Sri Lanka qui ont voyagé à bord du MS
Sun Sea
sont aussi visés par cette définition. En ce qui a trait à la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, citée par le demandeur, le défendeur fait valoir que le raisonnement dans la décision ne tient pas compte de qui sont les passagers du MS
Sun Sea
et que ceux-ci se sont principalement regroupés parce qu'ils voulaient échapper à une vie dans laquelle ils sont privés des droits de la personne. La SPR a conclu de façon raisonnable que le défendeur serait exposé au risque de torture, un moyen qu'utilisent les autorités sri-lankaises pour obtenir des renseignements sur les activités terroristes.
[21]
Le défendeur soutient de plus que le demandeur a tort de s'appuyer sur <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, car cette décision ne permet pas d'affirmer que le facteur de la race doit être suffisant pour que le défendeur soit exposé à un risque, peu importe les autres aspects de l'affaire et que par conséquent, elle se distingue de l'espèce.
[22]
Selon le défendeur, le débat sur la question de savoir s'il a, outre le lien fondé sur la race et le groupe social, un lien fondé sur des « opinions politiques présumées » est théorique. En effet, la SPR a conclu qu'il serait exposé à la persécution au motif qu'il est d'origine tamoule et que sa présence à bord du MS
Sun Sea
constituait un facteur de risque supplémentaire. De plus, le gouvernement du Sri Lanka a clairement indiqué qu'il estimait que le MS
Sun Sea
faisait partie d'une opération de passage de clandestins orchestrée par les TLET. Peu importe si le défendeur est perçu comme un partisan des TLET ou simplement comme un détenteur de renseignements sur les TLET, il est exposé à un risque plus grand que d'autres demandeurs d'asile qui retournent au Sri Lanka. Par conséquent, la décision de la SPR concernant le lien est raisonnable.
[23]
Enfin, le défendeur soutient que les éléments de preuve sur lesquels s'est appuyée la SPR ne sont pas périmés. À titre d'exemple, la SPR a examiné une déclaration du gouvernement sri-lankais faite un mois avant l'audience. En outre, contrairement à ce qu'allègue le demandeur, il existe des éléments de preuve concernant un rapatrié qui était un passager du MS
Sun Sea
. À son arrivée, il a été détenu et torturé. La SPR a le droit d'examiner les éléments de preuve de demandeurs d'asile qui se trouvent dans la même situation, comme le cas de ressortissants sri-lankais qui se sont enfuis en Australie et qui ont été torturés alors qu'ils étaient détenus à Boosa à leur retour au Sri Lanka. La SPR a conclu de façon raisonnable que les éléments de preuve concernant les cas où des agents gouvernementaux internationaux exercent une surveillance et où les autorités sri-lankaises respectent les normes de procédure ne règlent pas le problème du sort réservé aux rapatriés qui ne bénéficient pas de ce degré de protection. Compte tenu des violations des droits de la personne au Sri Lanka, il est raisonnable de conclure que les rapatriés qui ne bénéficient pas de ce processus de surveillance sont exposés à un risque. Le défendeur fait valoir que la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle il est exposé au risque d'être torturé s'il était renvoyé au Sri Lanka est raisonnable.
V.
Réponse du demandeur
[24]
Le demandeur soutient qu'une distinction devrait être faite entre la présente affaire et l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, parce que dans cet arrêt, la SPR n'a pas conclu que la race du demandeur était un facteur de causalité et que cet arrêt a été rendu il y a plus de vingt ans.
[25]
De plus, le demandeur soutient que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte des éléments de preuve qui lui avaient été présentés et qui montraient que les Tamouls ne sont plus exposés à la persécution en raison de leur origine ethnique.
[26]
Le demandeur fait en outre valoir que la SPR a ignoré certains éléments de preuve. En effet, la SPR a écarté des éléments de preuve indiquant que plusieurs rapatriés de l'étranger étaient en mesure de se réinstaller dans le pays sans éprouver de difficultés importantes, mais a émis l'hypothèse que cela ne s'appliquerait pas au cas du répondeur puisqu'il était un passager du MS
Sun Sea
. Selon le demandeur, l'appui de la part de la SPR sur des éléments de preuve périmés et imprécis concernant des personnes détenues à Boosa ne suffit pas pour respecter le critère qui consiste à établir plus qu'une simple possibilité de risque.
[27]
Enfin, de l'avis du demandeur, la SPR ne s'appuie pas sur des éléments de preuve montrant que les autorités ont recours à la torture avec des témoins qui collaborent. Aucun élément de l'analyse de la SPR n'indique que le défendeur ne serait pas disposé à fournir des renseignements aux autorités sri-lankaises. Dans deux décisions (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 206, au paragraphe 21, motifs de la juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 207, au paragraphe 21, motifs de la juge Snider), la Cour a conclu que si les rapatriés qui avaient voyagé à bord du MS
Sun Sea
sont interrogés à leur retour, cette preuve était insuffisante pour établir que ces rapatriés en particulier seraient persécutés ou torturés.
VI.
Questions en litige
1. La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le défendeur a qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention en raison d'un lien établi avec un motif prévu par la Convention est-elle déraisonnable?
2. La SPR a-t-elle appliqué la mauvaise norme de preuve à ses conclusions de fait en fondant des éléments essentiels de sa décision sur des hypothèse et des éléments de preuve périmés et imprécis?
VII.
Norme de contrôle
[28]
Les deux parties conviennent que la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique aux deux questions puisqu'elles soulèvent toutes deux des questions mixtes de fait et de droit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 51 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Je suis d'accord. Lorsqu'il évalue le caractère raisonnable d'une décision, le tribunal recherche la justification de la décision, la preuve sur laquelle elle s'appuie et l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel. En ce qui a trait à la conclusion tirée par l'organisme administratif, une cour doit examiner si elle appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit applicable (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 47 et 48).
VIII.

IX.
Analyse
[30]
Voici la conclusion de la SPR fondée sur l'article 96 de la LIPR:
Je suis d'avis, à la lumière de la preuve dont je dispose en l'espèce, que divers facteurs démontrent ensemble qu'il existe plus qu'une simple possibilité que le traitement qui sera réservé au demandeur d'asile à son retour au Sri Lanka constituera de la persécution en raison de son statut de Tamoul qui voyageait à bord du
Sun Sea
. (Voir le paragraphe 26 de la décision.)
[31]
Avant d'arriver à cette conclusion, la commissaire a tiré plusieurs conclusions détaillées qui se sont succédé comme le montre son analyse. Les éléments les plus pertinents sont résumés comme suit
:
La commissaire a conclu que tous les Tamouls au Sri Lanka étaient encore exposés à la discrimination sanctionnée par l'État, mais que l'origine tamoule ne constituait pas en soi un motif suffisant pour établir une possibilité sérieuse de persécution. De l'avis de la SPR, l'origine ethnique était un facteur contributif dont il fallait tenir compte avec les autres éléments pertinents. Il est important de souligner que dans sa décision, la SPR a mentionné l'origine tamoule du défendeur à plusieurs reprises pour illustrer le fait qu'elle constituait un facteur qui contribuait au risque de persécution, de même qu'un facteur aggravant en ce qui a trait au traitement que les autorités sri-lankaises pourraient lui réserver à son retour. La SPR a souligné que l'origine ethnique du défendeur devait être prise en compte, ainsi que le fait que le gouvernement sri-lankais pouvait tirer des conclusions concernant ses opinions politiques compte tenu de son statut d'ancien passager à bord du MS
Sun Sea
.
La commissaire a conclu que la présence du défendeur à bord du MS
Sun Sea
constituait un facteur qui ajoutait au risque de persécution.
La commissaire a aussi conclu qu'au retour du défendeur au Sri Lanka, les autorités sri-lankaises l'interrogeraient. La SPR a conclu qu'il serait tenu d'expliquer la façon dont il a quitté le Sri Lanka et que par conséquent, les autorités découvriraient son statut d'ancien passager à bord du MS
Sun Sea
.
Après avoir expliqué la façon dont le gouvernement du Sri Lanka considère le MS
Sun Sea
et qu'il le lie à une opération des TLET, le décideur a conclu qu'il existait une possibilité sérieuse que le défendeur, qui était un passager du MS
Sun Sea
, soit exposé à la persécution au moment de son arrivée ou par la suite, même s'il n'avait pas eu de liens avec les TLET dans son passé. En raison de l'attitude du gouvernement à l'égard du MS
Sun Sea
, l'associant aux TLET, les autorités considéreraient que le défendeur a des liens avec ce groupe et possède des renseignements précieux à son sujet ainsi que sur son rôle dans l'opération de passage de clandestins.
La SPR a également examiné la preuve selon laquelle les rapatriés ne sont pas bien traités à leur retour et que la torture était une technique d'interrogatoire fréquemment utilisée par les autorités gouvernementales au Sri Lanka.
[32]
L'effet cumulatif de ces conclusions a amené la SPR à croire que la race du défendeur (son origine tamoule) et son statut d'ancien passager à bord du MS
Sun Sea
sont des facteurs contribuant au risque de persécution. S'appuyant sur la doctrine des motifs mixtes, la SPR a conclu que la race et le statut d'ancien passager du MS
Sun Sea
, que le gouvernement du Sri Lanka considère être une opération organisée par les TLET, donneraient naissance à un risque de persécution de la part des agents de persécution à son retour. La SPR a de plus expliqué dans sa décision que le défendeur sera perçu comme quelqu'un qui possède des renseignements sur les TLET, qui a voyagé à bord du MS
Sun Sea
, et que les autorités sri-lankaises estiment être sous l'autorité des TLET. La commissaire a donc conclu qu'il existait une possibilité sérieuse que le défendeur soit persécuté.
[33]
Selon le demandeur, la connaissance que le défendeur pourrait avoir au sujet des TLET ne permet pas d'établir l'existence d'un lien fondé sur les opinions politiques d'un demandeur d'asile craignant d'être persécuté parce qu'on croit qu'il possède des renseignements sur une organisation, et non parce qu'on croit qu'il partage les opinions politiques de cette organisation. Ces renseignements n'ont pas de lien avec le motif relatif aux « opinions politiques » prévu par la Convention.
[34]
Cet argument ne saurait être retenu. Dans
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> motifs du juge Blanchard - une affaire portant sur une question semblable -, la Cour a déclaré ce qui suit relativement à la conclusion de la SPR concernant les connaissances présumées sur les TLET:
[21] Les conclusions de la SPR auraient pu être beaucoup plus claires qu'elles ne le sont; il est permis de penser qu'elles sont lacunaires à certains égards. Par exemple, la SPR ne pouvait invoquer la présumée
connaissance
des activités des TLET pour appuyer sa conclusion relative aux opinions politiques présumées. Je suis néanmoins convaincu que la preuve à laquelle le tribunal a fait référence dans ses motifs permet de conclure que le défendeur, en tant que jeune Tamoul célibataire venant du Nord du Sri Lanka, craint avec raison d'être persécuté du fait de sa race et de ses opinions politiques présumées en raison de son
association
perçue avec les TLET. Je suis convaincu que la conclusion de la SPR est raisonnable.
[35]
Dans sa décision, la SPR indique clairement que sa conclusion selon laquelle le défendeur serait exposé à un risque de persécution était en partie fondée sur son statut en tant qu'ancien passager du MS
Sun Sea
, que les autorités sri-lankaises associent aux TLET, comme l'indique la déclaration du secrétaire à la Défense. Par conséquent, il existe un fondement suffisant pour conclure qu'il existe un lien avec des opinions politiques, puisqu'il serait perçu comme étant associé aux TLET.
[36]
Le demandeur soutient de plus que la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle l'origine tamoule du défendeur, de concert avec d'autres facteurs, était suffisante pour créer un lien valable avec un motif prévu par la Convention suivant l'article 96 de la LIPR, est déraisonnable. Selon lui, il ne s'agit pas d'une conclusion tirée en fonction de motifs mixtes fondés sur l'origine ethnique, mais plutôt une conclusion erronée selon laquelle les passagers du MS
Sun Sea
ont un lien avec un motif prévu par la Convention. Le demandeur soutient que pour réussir à établir des motifs mixtes de persécution, un des motifs doit être lié avec un motif prévu par la Convention. Selon le demandeur, puisque la commissaire n'a pas établi de lien entre l'origine tamoule comme telle et un motif prévu par la Convention, il n'est pas possible d'établir un lien en vertu de l'article 96 de la LIPR.
[37]
Je ne souscris pas à une interprétation aussi limitée de la doctrine des motifs mixtes qui va à l'encontre de l'esprit de la Convention. L'article 96 de la LIPR ne vise qu'un seul objectif qui consiste à empêcher quiconque d'être persécuté dans les situations où un lien existe avec un motif prévu par la Convention. Si l'un des motifs de l'agent de persécution est la race, mais uniquement en combinaison avec un autre facteur, comment une telle situation ne pourrait-elle pas permettre de répondre aux exigences de l'article 96 de la LIPR? Après tout, l'article 96 de la LIPR, tel que rédigé, ne doit pas recevoir une interprétation restrictive et étroite: comme je l'ai souligné, il porte sur la crainte d'être persécuté et la protection de quiconque fait l'objet de persécution du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques. De plus, l'alinéa 3(2)d) de la LIPR indique clairement que l'un des principaux objets du système d'octroi de l'asile au Canada est « d'offrir l'asile à ceux qui craignent avec raison d'être persécutés du fait de leur race, leur religion, leur nationalité, leurs opinions politiques, leur appartenance à un groupe social en particulier, ainsi qu'à ceux qui risquent la torture ou des traitements ou peines cruels et inusités ». L'article 96 de la LIPR doit être interprété à la lumière de cet objet.
[38]
L'approche fondée sur les motifs mixtes pour tirer une conclusion liée à l'article 96 de la LIPR n'est pas nouvelle. Depuis plus de 20 ans, la Cour d'appel fédérale reconnaît la validité de ce genre d'analyse. En effet, tant dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), aux paragraphes 17 à 19, motifs du juge Décary, que dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour d'appel fédérale a reconnu que la race pouvait être un « facteur de causalité » lorsqu'une personne est exposée à un risque de persécution de la part d'agents de l'État et que ce facteur de causalité, pris en compte avec d'autres motifs, peut établir une possibilité sérieuse de persécution:
Selon nous, il est des plus évidents que lorsqu'une personne fait face à des risques « réels et accablants », y compris un risque d' « actes fort violents », de la part de groupes parrainés par l'État (l'IPKF), parce que cette personne fait partie d'un groupe dont la race est la caractéristique déterminante (les jeunes Tamuls de sexe masculin), il est tout simplement impossible de dire qu'une telle personne n'éprouve pas une crainte objective d'être persécuté du fait de sa race.
(Voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, à la page 2.)
La question n'est pas de savoir si la persécution peut être liée à un motif prévu par la Convention, mais plutôt de savoir si un motif comme la race peut être un facteur contributif ou un facteur de causalité.
[39]
La notion des motifs mixtes dans le contexte des demandes d'asile a tout d'abord été reconnue dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 1600 (CAF), au paragraphe 2, motifs du juge MacGuigan, lorsque la Cour d'appel fédérale a déclaré ce qui suit: « Les gens agissent fréquemment pour diverses raisons, et il suffit qu'un des motifs soit de nature politique pour conclure à l'existence d'une motivation politique. »
[40]
Depuis cet arrêt, la Cour a appliqué l'approche fondée sur les motifs mixtes à plusieurs décisions rendues suivant l'article 96 de la LIPR. À titre d'exemple, une conclusion de motifs mixtes fondés sur la race et l'âge comme facteurs contributifs a été reconnue comme un fondement valable pour un motif prévu à la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 221, au paragraphe 8, motifs du juge McKeown. En outre, les motifs mixtes ont aussi été associés à la manière dont les agents de l'État perçoivent les situations et à leurs motifs lorsqu'ils évaluent de telles situations. Dans une décision de 2003, la Cour a indiqué que le fait que « des opinions politiques avaient été ou auraient pu être imputées par l'autorité gouvernementale au demandeur » pouvait constituer le fondement d'une conclusion de motifs mixtes (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 126, au paragraphe 14, motifs du juge Martineau). Dans une autre décision, la Cour a souligné que si l'un des motifs pouvait être lié à un motif prévu par la Convention, un lien peut être établi (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 140, au paragraphe 12, motifs du juge Teitelbaum).
[41]
Plus récemment, la Cour a examiné la question des motifs mixtes lorsqu'elle a reconnu qu'une motivation pouvait ne pas être considérée comme étant « uniquement » économique, si la preuve indique qu'elle comportait une composante raciale. Il est donc possible de conclure à l'existence de motifs mixtes si l'un des motifs est lié à un motif prévu par la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (4th) 113 au paragraphe 29, motifs du juge Zinn).
[42]
L'avocate du demandeur s'appuie sur <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, pour soutenir que les actes à caractère raciste constituent de la persécution uniquement si, pris isolément, ils sont suffisants pour établir un motif prévu par la Convention. En toute déférence, je n'interprète pas la décision de cette façon. À mon avis, la Cour a estimé que si, compte tenu de la preuve, on avait conclu que ce qu'avait subi le demandeur comportait une composante raciale, une conclusion de « motivation mixte [était] possible », mais cela n'était pas le cas.
[...] Je suis d'accord avec l'avocat du défendeur qu'une telle motivation mixte est possible. Ce qui manque en l'espèce, selon moi, c'est une preuve objective que les agressions commises avaient pour but, en partie du moins, de persécuter le défendeur parce qu'il était blanc. [...]
(Voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 129.)
[43]
Par conséquent, la question visait le caractère suffisant de la preuve concernant la motivation raciale. Si la composante raciale de l'agression avait été démontrée, il aurait été alors possible d'établir des motifs mixtes chez l'agresseur et la race aurait pu être déclarée un facteur qui avait contribué à la motivation principale qui consistait à voler le demandeur.
[44]
La SPR a conclu que l'origine tamoule du défendeur était un facteur qui contribuait et aggravait le risque de persécution auquel il est exposé s'il devait retourner au Sri Lanka. La commissaire a conclu que cela établissait un lien avec un motif prévu par la Convention, de concert avec le fait qu'il était un passager du MS
Sun Sea
, que le gouvernement sri-lankais considère comme une opération de passage de clandestins orchestrée par les TLET. J'estime que cette conclusion quant au lien est raisonnable et compatible avec la perspective historique de la doctrine des motifs mixtes que la Cour d'appel fédérale et la Cour ont toutes deux adoptée.
[45]
Pour qu'il soit permis de tirer cette conclusion, il faut que l'origine tamoule du défendeur soit un facteur de première importance qui contribue à la possibilité de risque de persécution à son arrivée au Sri Lanka. Or, pris individuellement, les motifs, fondés sur l'origine tamoule du défendeur ainsi que sur son statut en tant qu'ancien passager du MS
Sun Sea
, que le gouvernement considère être une opération de passage de clandestins orchestrée par les TLET, ne permettent pas par eux-mêmes d'établir un lien avec le motif de la race prévu par la Convention. Cependant, pris ensemble, ils établissent de façon cumulative une possibilité sérieuse de risque de persécution au retour du défendeur. Sans l'un des facteurs contributifs, le motif prévu par la Convention ne serait pas établi de façon satisfaisante, mais pris ensemble, ces motifs constituent le fondement du motif fondé sur la race. Par conséquent, le lien avec la race était essentiel pour la conclusion de la SPR portant que le risque de persécution au retour du défendeur constituait un scénario sérieux à envisager.
[46]
En guise de deuxième argument, le demandeur soutient que les conclusions de fait tirées par la SPR concernant le fait que le gouvernement sri-lankais considère que le MS
Sun Sea
est une opération liée aux TLET, sa conclusion selon laquelle le défendeur, en tant qu'ancien passager du MS
Sun Sea
ferait l'objet d'un interrogatoire et que les autorités découvriraient son statut, et sa conclusion selon laquelle la preuve indique que des agents du gouvernement torturent des rapatriés à leur retour, n'ont pas été tirées conformément aux éléments de preuve soumis ou évalués selon la prépondérance de la preuve.
[47]
La décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle est très bien écrite. Elle est rédigée avec soin, est bien documentée et est conforme au droit et à la jurisprudence applicables. Il s'agit assurément d'une décision raisonnable, puisqu'elle appartient aux « issues possibles acceptables » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47).
[48]
La SPR a bien fait l'examen de la preuve documentaire concernant toutes les questions, notamment l'attitude du gouvernement du Sri Lanka envers les rapatriés sri-lankais, son recours à la torture, sa vision du MS
Sun Sea
, y compris la plus récente déclaration du secrétaire à la Défense selon lequel le voyage du MS
Sun Sea
constitue un exemple des activités criminelles de transport international des TLET pour faire entrer clandestinement des gens dans des pays occidentaux pour lever des fonds pour la cause séparatiste, et son examen est pondéré et les conclusions tirées sont justifiées. Je conclus que la SPR n'a fait aucune conjecture dans le cadre de son appréciation de la preuve et je conclus qu'aucune de ses conclusions n'était fondée sur des éléments de preuve périmés ou imprécis. Le demandeur n'est pas d'accord avec les conclusions de la SPR et souhaiterait que la Cour examine la preuve et arrive à un résultat différent. Les conclusions de la SPR étaient raisonnables et l'intervention de la Cour n'est donc pas justifiée.
