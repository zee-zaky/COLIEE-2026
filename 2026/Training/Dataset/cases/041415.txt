INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c. 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated 25 July 2011 (Decision), which declared the Applicant's appeal from the decision of a visa officer (Second Officer) at the visa post in Buffalo, New York, was
res judicata
and declined to hear her appeal.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant was born in Fiji and is a Canadian citizen. Her husband (Dhindsa) is a citizen of India.
[3]
In 2005 the Applicant filed a sponsorship application to bring Dhindsa to Canada as a permanent resident under the Family Class. An officer (First Officer) with Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) denied that application after he found that Dhindsa and the Applicant (Couple) did not have a genuine marriage within the meaning of section 4 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
SOR/2002-227 (Regulations). The Applicant appealed that decision to the IAD and on 29 August 2007, the IAD refused her appeal (First Appeal). The Applicant did not apply for judicial review of that decision.
[4]
The Applicant filed a second spousal sponsorship application on 2 March 2009 to bring Dhindsa to Canada (Second Application). Prior to making a decision on the file, CIC noted that concerns from the First Appeal about the Couple's differing religious backgrounds were still present in the Second Application. CIC felt Dhindsa's work as a Sikh priest was incongruous with his marriage to the Applicant, who is Hindu. After interviewing Dhindsa on 2 September 2010, an immigration officer (Second Officer) at the Buffalo visa post denied the Second Application, again finding that the Couple did not have a genuine marriage within the meaning of the Regulations. The Applicant appealed this refusal to the IAD.
[5]
Before hearing the Applicant's appeal of the Second Officer's decision, the IAD notified the Applicant on 17 January 2011 that it appeared her second appeal was an attempt to relitigate issues which the IAD had already decided. The IAD invited the Applicant to address this issue with written submissions, which she provided on 14 February 2011.
[6]
In her written submissions, the Applicant said she had fresh, decisive evidence which she could not have presented at the First Appeal. She said she was unrepresented at the First Appeal and thought at that time that she could not call Dhindsa as a witness. She also said she had additional evidence of a continuing relationship with Dhindsa and asked the IAD to exercise its discretion to allow the Second Appeal to proceed on its merits. The Applicant also said injustice would result from a refusal to hear the Second Appeal because the Couple would have to live in separate countries. She also submitted the evidence she intended to rely on to the IAD.
[7]
The Respondent made submissions on this
res judicata
issue on 29 April 2011 and said the Applicant's evidence dated from after the First Appeal and was not evidence the Couple's marriage was genuine when it was entered into. The Respondent also said the Applicant's failure to call Dhindsa on the First Appeal was her choice. Dhindsa's testimony could not be fresh evidence, given that the Applicant could have called him as a witness during the First Appeal.
[8]
The Applicant replied to the Respondent's submissions on 17 May 2011, saying evidence of a continuing relationship can be evidence of commitment at the time of the marriage. She again asked the IAD to exercise its discretion to hear her appeal.
[9]
The IAD considered the parties' submissions and, on 25 July 2011, refused to exercise its jurisdiction to hear her appeal because the
res judicata
principle applied. The IAD notified the Applicant of its Decision on 2 August 2011.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[10]
The IAD noted that
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  establishes the following three part test for the application of issue estoppel:
a. The same question has been decided;
b. The decision said to create the estoppel was final;
c. The parties to the previous decision or their privies are the same as the parties to the proceeding in which the estoppel is raised.
[11]
The IAD found all three elements were met in the instant case. The IAD's decision in the First Appeal was final and the Applicant did not ask for judicial review of that decision. The parties to the Second Appeal were the same: the Respondent and the Applicant. Finally, the same issue was in play in both appeals: whether the Couple's marriage is genuine.
[12]
The RPD also noted that, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court of Canada found the underlying purpose of issue estoppel is to balance the public interest in the finality of litigation with the public interest in seeing justice done on the facts of the case. In
Danyluk,
the Supreme Court of Canada also held that, to prevent injustice, decision-makers have the discretion to hear matters in which issue estoppel would otherwise apply. The IAD noted that several factors may be analysed with respect to this discretion, including the wording of the decision-maker's enabling statute, procedural safeguards available to the parties, availability of an appeal, the decision maker's expertise, circumstances leading to the previous proceedings, and any potential injustice.
Application of Factors
[13]
Having found the three preconditions for issue estoppel existed in the Applicant's case, the IAD turned to whether it should exercise its discretion to hear her appeal anyway. The IAD noted that it has in the past recognized that new information is sufficient to overcome issue estoppel and that there is no appeal from IAD decisions, although the Applicant could seek judicial review in this Court. It also found that the IAD is a court of competent jurisdiction with expertise in immigration matters, including sponsorship appeals. It further found the circumstances which led to the Second Appeal were the same as those leading up to the First Appeal, with the only significant change being the passage of time.
[14]
The IAD noted that the Applicant, in her written submissions on the
res judicata
issue, said "there is fresh evidence that supports the finding that [her] marriage to [Dhindsa] is genuine and that this evidence could not have been adduced at the earlier proceeding by the exercise of reasonable diligence." To evaluate whether it should exercise its discretion to hear the Second Appeal, the IAD determined that it would focus on the potential injustice to the Applicant if it did not. In particular, the IAD focussed on whether new evidence existed, and whether an injustice would occur if that evidence were not considered.
New Evidence and Injustice
[15]
To asses whether the evidence the Applicant submitted was new, the IAD applied the test the Supreme Court of Canada set out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Supreme Court of Canada said new evidence should not be admitted if it could have been adduced in the first proceeding with due diligence; the evidence must bear on a decisive or potentially decisive issue; the evidence must be credible; and, if accepted, the evidence would have affected the result of the previous proceeding.
[16]
The IAD noted the Applicant said the new evidence she submitted showed the Couple had a continuing relationship, which established that their commitment when they got married was genuine. The IAD also noted that, in the First Appeal, it found the Applicant did not rebut the First Officer's concerns and that her testimony raised additional concerns. The Second Officer found that the same root concerns the IAD expressed in the First Appeal still existed. In the refusal letter, the Second Officer found that he was not satisfied the Applicant had addressed his concerns about the genuineness of the Couple's marriage.
[17]
The IAD noted the Applicant's assertion she did not know she could call Dhindsa as a witness at the First Appeal because she was self-represented at that time. The IAD found that self-representation and not calling Dhindsa were the Applicant's own choices. The IAD notified the Applicant before the First Appeal that she could be represented by counsel and found the fact she had since retained counsel and wished to call Dhindsa as a witness in the Second Appeal did not amount to fresh evidence. Further, the IAD found that the Applicant could have anticipated the concerns it raised in the First Appeal.
[18]
The IAD also found the Applicant understood at the first hearing that she could call Dhindsa as a witness. The Applicant was a party to her marriage, so she must have understood that Dhindsa was just as well situated as she was to give evidence on the genuineness of their marriage. Further, the onus was on her at that time to establish that her marriage was genuine. Nothing had stood in the way of her calling Dhindsa to testify.
[19]
The IAD further found injustice would not result if the Applicant were not able to call Dhindsa as a witness in a second proceeding. The Applicant's failure to call Dhindsa was a choice she had made, and any evidence he could provide would not be determinative of her appeal. The IAD said that
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  shows that calling an applicant is not always necessary, so it would not be necessary for the IAD to hear from Dhindsa.
[20]
The IAD also reviewed evidence submitted by the Applicant on the Second Appeal, which she said showed her marriage is genuine. The IAD found it considered similar evidence in the First Appeal, and that this evidence was not decisive of whether the Couple's marriage is genuine. The IAD also found photographs the Applicant submitted on the Second Appeal were not decisive evidence that the marriage is genuine. Money transfer receipts the Applicant submitted were also not decisive of the genuineness of the Couple's marriage.
[21]
Although the Applicant had provided telephone bills to the IAD on the Second Appeal, it found this was more evidence of what was before it in the First Appeal, so it could not add to what the IAD had already considered. This evidence was not new and not decisive of the issue at hand. The IAD also noted that, in the First Appeal, it had identified credibility concerns related to the same evidence; on the Second Appeal, it found the additional evidence did not address these concerns.
Conclusion
[22]
The IAD found that the evidence the Applicant submitted on the Second Appeal did not amount to decisive new evidence that the Couple had lived together, intended to live together permanently, or had a deeper relationship. The additional evidence did not address the concerns the IAD raised in the First Appeal about the Couple's intentions when they were married. The First Appeal failed because the Couple did not address these concerns, even though they had a fair opportunity to do so.
[23]
The IAD found the three part test for
res judicata
was established and, because the additional evidence the Applicant submitted was not new or decisive, it was not in the interests of justice to exercise its discretion to hear the Second Appeal. The issues related to the genuineness of the Couple's marriage were adequately considered in the First Appeal.
[24]
The IAD declined jurisdiction and dismissed the Second Appeal.
ISSUES
[25]
The Applicant raises the following issues in this case:
a. Whether the IAD erred in finding she had not provided fresh evidence;
b. Whether the IAD failed to consider its discretion to hear the Second Appeal, even though the test for
res judicata
was made out;
c. Whether the IAD's reasons are adequate.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[26]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[27]
The first issue the Applicant raises - whether the evidence she adduced on the Second Appeal was new - is a question in which the factual and legal issues are inextricably intertwined. The IAD was called on to determine whether the evidence the Applicant presented was relevant to or decisive of the issue in the Second Appeal. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 51, the Supreme Court of Canada held that questions like this are to be evaluated on the reasonableness standard (see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The standard of review on the first issue is reasonableness.
[28]
On the third issue, the Supreme Court of Canada has recently held that the adequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision (see Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Rather, "the reasons must be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes." The IAD's reasons in this case must therefore be analysed along with the reasonableness of the Decision as a whole.
[29]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
[30]
The standard of review with respect to the second issue in this case is correctness. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 66 "The appellant is entitled at some stage to appropriate consideration of the discretionary factors [in the
res judicata
analysis]." Where the three pre-conditions for
res judicata
exist, the decision maker is then obligated to consider whether to exercise discretion to hear the matter anyway. The reviewing Court is called on to analyse whether the decision-maker complied with this obligation and will not show deference to the decision-maker's reasoning ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 50).

ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
The IAD Unreasonably Found no new Evidence
[33]
The Applicant says the IAD unreasonably concluded the evidence she submitted to support the Second Appeal was not new or decisive. Although the IAD analysed each type of evidence she submitted, it did not assess whether, in its totality, the evidence she submitted showed the Couple's marriage was genuine.
[34]
She says her new evidence shows her marriage was actually genuine. She submitted evidence of a recent trip to India, which she says speaks to the IAD's concern in the First Appeal that the Couple's different backgrounds cast doubt on the genuineness of their marriage.
[35]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the IAD held, at paragraphs 33 and 34, that
The appellant and applicant have been married since April 2002. Their marriage has endured over five years despite two refusal [
sic
] and two appeals. All the indicia typically considered by the IAD in assessing the genuineness of a marriage are present and to a greater and lesser degree the indicia are positive. The evidence speaks to a relationship entered into on the basis of a traditional arranged marriage. The respective families were involved in the arrangement which, while compact in time, does not suggest an attempt to hide the marriage. The evidence considered today was found credible and it answered the concerns raised by the visa officer.
When considered in its totality the evidence does not support a conclusion that the marriage was entered into in bad faith. The panel finds that on a balance of probabilities the marriage is genuine and not entered into primarily to facilitate the applicant's immigration to Canada.
[36]
Singh
teaches that continuing contact between the parties to a marriage can constitute fresh evidence that marriage is genuine. The Couple's marriage has lasted longer than the marriage under scrutiny in
Singh
, so the IAD should have found the length of their marriage was new evidence on the Second Appeal. The length of the Couple's marriage was part of the totality of the evidence which established their marriage was genuine.
[37]
The Applicant submitted substantial evidence to show her commitment to Dhindsa since the IAD rejected the First Appeal. Dhindsa moved to the United States of America (USA) to be closer to the Applicant, and she took a long trip to India in 2011 to be with him. Both of these events show their continued commitment, but the IAD found these did not constitute new evidence. The Applicant relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  noting that the IAD in that case found evidence of a trip and spending time together was sufficient to overcome the application of
res judicata
. She says her case should have been decided in the same way as <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The IAD also rejected evidence of phone calls and the Applicant's trips to see Dhindsa because she submitted the same type of evidence at the First Appeal. However, the Applicant points to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the IAD accepted evidence of the same type as had been adduced in a previous appeal because the evidence was relevant to the genuineness of the marriage under scrutiny in that case.
[38]
The Applicant points out that she was unrepresented at the First Appeal and says she did not understand her rights at that time. This prevented her from calling Dhindsa as a witness. The Applicant points to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  which the IAD distinguished in the Decision. The Applicant is in a similar situation to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> because she too has submitted new and decisive evidence.
The IAD did not Consider whether Special Circumstances Existed
[39]
The IAD's analysis ended with a finding that
res judicata
applied without any analysis of whether special circumstances existed to justify exercising the discretion to hear the Second Appeal. She points to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  establishes the IAD must consider its discretion to hear an appeal when the three pre-conditions for issue estoppel are met. She points to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the proposition that potential injustice is a factor that can lead the IAD to exercise its discretion to hear an appeal where
res judicata
would otherwise apply.
[40]
Rather than considering whether to exercise its discretion to hear the Second Appeal, the IAD conflated this issue with the three part test for issue estoppel. The IAD wrote that
The Panel will focus on whether or not there is a potential for injustice should the IAD not hear the appeal of the second refusal to grant [Dhindsa] a permanent resident visa. In particular, whether or not there is 'new' evidence which meets the test for such evidences [
sic
] which would establish an exception to the application of
res judicata
to this matter.
[41]
The circumstances of the case suggest the IAD should have exercised its discretion to hear the Second Appeal. The Applicant points to the fact that the parties are an individual and the Crown and says injustice will result from the IAD's refusal to hear her appeal because the Couple will not be able to live together in the same country. The Applicant cannot move to India to live with Dhindsa because she has health problems when she is there and does not have status in India. The interests the IAD was called on to balance are the state's interest in the administration of justice against the Applicant's interest in being united with her spouse.
[42]
Although the IAD considered the Applicant's submission that the Couple would not be able to live together, it noted that family reunification is not guaranteed under the Act. However, family reunification is an important objective of the Act under paragraph 3(1)(
d
). Preventing family reunification is a potential injustice which the IAD should address when considering its discretion to hear cases. The IAD should have given the Couple's reunification significant weight when it considered whether to hear the Second Appeal.
The Respondent
[43]
The Respondent says the IAD reasonably exercised its discretion not to hear the Second Appeal. It examined the evidence the Applicant submitted and concluded it did not address the concerns raised in the First Appeal. The Applicant simply disagrees with the IAD's conclusion, so the Court should not intervene.
Preconditions for
Res Judicata
met
[44]
The IAD reasonably found the three pre-conditions, established in
Angle
, above, were met in the Second Appeal. The same question was at issue in both the First and Second Appeals: whether the Couple's marriage is genuine. The parties were also the same, and the First Appeal was a final determination of this issue. The Respondent says <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, establishes that where the three preconditions are met,
res judicata
must apply unless special circumstances exist for the decision maker to exercise the discretion to hear a case on its merits.
Special Circumstances Reasonably Assessed
[45]
The IAD reviewed the availability of an exception to the application of
res judicata
and noted some of the factors decision-makers may take into account when deciding whether to exercise their discretion to hear a case on its merits. When it examined whether the Applicant had submitted new evidence, the IAD considered whether this would lead to injustice if the Second Appeal were not heard. In examining whether the evidence was new, the IAD reasonably applied the test for new evidence articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Public School Boards' Assn.
, above. All the Applicant has done in her arguments to the Court is to reiterate the arguments she raised before the IAD; she has not demonstrated that the IAD's exercise of discretion was unreasonable.
Evidence Not New
[46]
Although the Applicant has argued that she put forward fresh, new evidence about her relationship with Dhindsa, the IAD found this was not the case. It found the evidence she submitted was before the IAD on the First Appeal, that the evidence was not determinative, and that the evidence did not address its concerns. The IAD also held that it had fully canvassed the genuineness of the Couple's marriage on the First Appeal. Although the Applicant wished to call Dhindsa on the Second Appeal and said she was not aware he could have testified at the First Appeal, the IAD found the onus was on her to establish her case and it was her decision not to have him testify at that time. This was a reasonable conclusion for the IAD to draw.
[47]
The IAD also reasonably concluded that Dhindsa's failure to testify was a defect in the Applicant's presentation of her case on the First Appeal and that his testimony did not constitute new evidence on the Second Appeal. The IAD noted it had not drawn a negative inference from Dhindsa's failure to testify at the First Appeal, and found that no prejudice to the Applicant would result if he were not permitted to testify again. The IAD also reasonably rejected the Applicant's assertion she did not know she could have counsel. It pointed to the Notice of Appeal sent to her by the IAD which specifically said she had the right to counsel on the First Appeal.
[48]
The IAD also reasonably concluded that the Applicant's evidence of their continuing relationship was not new evidence the Couple intended to live together permanently. The IAD was not bound to follow its previous decisions which the Applicant has cited, because these cases do not determine whether the evidence submitted in this case was new or decisive. The task before the Court is not to compare the evidence in this case with the evidence submitted in other cases; the Court is to determine whether the IAD's conclusion in this case was reasonable on the record before it.
[49]
The Respondent says that
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is similar to the instant case. Justice Judith Snider held at paragraph 19 that
[...] the IAD's reasons for refusing the first appeal involved findings which were not addressed by the Applicant's new evidence. Accordingly, it was, at the very least, open to the IAD in the Second IAD Appeal to conclude that there was no decisive fresh evidence demonstrably capable of altering the outcome of the earlier finding. I do not find that the decision by the IAD in the Second IAD Appeal not to find that there were circumstances which warranted the hearing of the case on the merits is patently unreasonable.
[50]
The IAD's finding, which the Court upheld in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is similar to the finding the Applicant challenges in this case. The result should be the same.
[51]
The IAD based its decision on an analysis of the evidence as a whole:
Significantly, all of this evidence does not speak to the first Panel's concerns on the intent of the parties to the marriage, including the appellant's lack of knowledge and disinterest in [Dhindsa's] family and her lack of knowledge about his friends.
[52]
The IAD was not bound to refer to or explain why it did not accept every piece of evidence the Applicant submitted. The IAD considered all the evidence, but this was not enough to convince it that the Couple's marriage was genuine. The Applicant simply disagrees with the way the IAD weighed the evidence before it, which is not subject to judicial review.
Other Circumstances Considered
[53]
In addition to considering whether the Applicant's evidence was new, the IAD also considered the Applicant's assertion that the couple could only live together in Canada. The IAD considered this aspect of her submissions, but concluded that it was not in the interests of justice for it to hear the Second Appeal.
The Applicant's Reply
[54]
The Applicant says her argument does not deal with how the IAD weighed the evidence before it. Rather, she says the IAD did not consider the evidence as whole even though it addressed the concerns the IAD raised in the First Appeal. She says Dhindsa's move to the USA showed their marriage was genuine, as did the phone bills she submitted. These bills dated from after the First Appeal, so they demonstrated the couple's continuing commitment to one another. Further, the photos she submitted of them together with Dhindsa's family show the Applicant knew his family, which was one of the IAD's concerns in the First Appeal. On the whole, the evidence the Applicant submitted addressed the IAD's concerns on the First Appeal, so it should have exercised its discretion to hear the Second Appeal.
Insufficient Reasons
[55]
The Applicant also says the IAD did not adequately treat all the evidence she submitted in its reasons. It was not enough for the IAD to say that it had considered all the evidence. It did not mention the fact that she had lived with Dhindsa for a month in 2011. This was evidence which contradicted the IAD's findings so, following
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the IAD was bound to address it.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  teaches that commitment over time is capable of establishing the genuineness of a marriage.
[56]
Further, the IAD also did not show in its reasons why the totality of the evidence the Applicant submitted on the Second Appeal did not address the issues raised in the First Appeal. It was not enough for the IAD to simply say that the evidence did not address these concerns. The Applicant says the Respondent has admitted that the IAD treated several pieces of evidence individually. The IAD actually considered each piece of evidence in isolation, which led it to an unreasonable conclusion.
Applicant Unrepresented
[57]
Relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Applicant also says that the IAD must ensure that unrepresented parties receive a fair hearing. Dhindsa's testimony could have served to clarify the issues the IAD was concerned about at the First Appeal.
Jurisprudence
[58]
Although the Respondent says the IAD was not bound by its previous decisions which the Applicant has cited, the IAD failed to consider how these cases established the relevance of the evidence she submitted. The cases she cited establish that evidence of an ongoing relationship can demonstrate the marriage was genuine when it was entered into, which the IAD did not appreciate in this case.
[59]
Anttal,
which the Respondent has said should govern the outcome of this case, is distinguishable on its facts. Although Justice Snider upheld the IAD in finding that the evidence presented in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> did not address the concerns the IAD raised in the first appeal, the Applicant says her evidence in this case addressed the IAD's concerns in the First Appeal. Hence, the IAD should have exercised its discretion to hear the Second Appeal.
Potential Injustice
[60]
Although the IAD said it would analyse the Applicant's case in terms of the potential injustice which would result from not considering any new evidence she adduced, the Applicant says the IAD only evaluated some of the evidence she submitted on the Second Appeal. The IAD did not analyse whether injustice would result if it did not hear the Second Appeal. The IAD's failure to consider how the Couple would be separated if it did not hear the Second Appeal renders its Decision unreasonable.
ANALYSIS
[61]
In the Decision, the IAD concluded that the preconditions for the application of
issue estoppel
as outlined in
Angle
, above, were met:
The Panel is satisfied that, on the basis of the information before it, the preconditions to the operation of
issue estoppel
exist in the instant matter. First, the previous IAD decision was final. There was no application for judicial review of the previous decision. Second, the parties to the decision are the same, namely the appellant (and the applicant) and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. Third, the issues are the same, that is, the genuineness of the marriage.
[62]
The IAD then went on to decide whether, notwithstanding that the preconditions for
issue estoppel
were met, it should exercise its discretion in accordance with the governing jurisprudence and hear the appeal:
The Panel will focus on whether or not there is a potential for injustice should the IAD not hear the appeal of the second refusal to grant the applicant a permanent resident visa. In particular, whether or not there is "new" evidence which meets the test for such evidences which would establish an exception to the application of
res judicata
to this matter.
[63]
Essentially, the Applicant's case before the IAD for an exception to
res judicata
and an exercise of its discretion in her favour was that there was fresh evidence to support a finding that the marriage was genuine, and that this evidence could not have been adduced at the earlier proceeding by the exercise of reasonable diligence.
[64]
I find that the issue of whether the preconditions for
res judicata
were satisfied in this case was decided correctly by the IAD.
[65]
The preconditions for
res judicata
, as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Angle
, above, are as follows:
a. The same question was decided in earlier proceedings;
b. The judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and
c. The parties to the judicial decision were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel was raised.
[66]
In the present case, the IAD determined that these preconditions were all met. The question to be determined, the genuineness of the Applicant's marriage, and the parties to the decision were the same as those in the previous IAD decision. The IAD is a court of competent jurisdiction with the authority to dispose of sponsorship appeals. Therefore, the previous decision was final, and the IAD was correct in finding that the preconditions for
res judicata
were met.
[67]
The case law has established that, where the preconditions are met, issue estoppel must apply unless special circumstances exist which would warrant hearing the case on its merits. The Supreme Court of Canada has determined that an evaluation of the special circumstances requires the decision-maker to ask whether, taking into account all of the circumstances, the application of issue estoppel would result in an injustice. See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 64 to 67.
[68]
The essence of this application before me is the Applicant's contention that the IAD's analysis ended with the determination that the three prerequisite issues for the application of
res judicata
applied. The Applicant says that the IAD did not consider whether special circumstances existed to justify allowing the appeal, nor did it consider whether or not to exercise its discretion to allow the appeal to proceed, given the injustice that would result to the Applicant, as is required by the common law on the application of
res judicata
. In failing to consider whether the exercise of discretion was warranted, the IAD committed an error of law, which the Applicant says begs the intervention of this Court.
[69]
In other words, did the IAD reasonably, as a matter of discretion, determine that
issue estoppel
or
res judicata
ought to be applied in the Applicant's case?
[70]
The Applicant claims that, instead of considering her new evidence in its totality, the IAD evaluated each type of evidence separately and failed entirely to take into account her most recent trip to India, which went directly to concerns about the genuineness of the marriage and, in particular, about the Applicant's lack of interest in her husband's family.
[71]
In this regard, I accept the Applicant's argument that the IAD addressed the evidence in a piecemeal fashion and effectively failed to address the crucial point that evidence of a continuing commitment which was not adduced, and could not have been adduced, at the previous hearings can speak to the parties' intention at the time of the marriage.
[72]
The IAD also found that the Applicant's evidence did not address the first panel's concerns regarding the intent of the parties to the marriage. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 7 and 8, Justice Douglas Campbell found that subsequent proof of commitment can be considered proof of commitment at the time of marriage:
The Federal Court of Appeal held in Kaloti that an "abusive attempt to relitigate" can be an abuse of process. Implicit in Kaloti, and accepted in Kular, is the point that, in matters such as this, new applications cannot be made without new evidence pertaining to a spouse's intent at the time of marriage.
The Applicant argues that the evidence of continuing commitment is new in that its current nature was not present in the previous hearing, and that it speaks to the parties' intention at the time of marriage. I agree with this submission.
It is not contested that the IAD typically uses evidence of subsequent conduct (see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (F.C.T.D.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (F.C.T.D.). In addition, s.5.9.1 of the Immigration Overseas Processing Manual lists several factors that visa officers should consider when deciding if a marriage is a marriage of convenience, including whether spouses have lived together. This guideline recognizes that evidence of commitment over time is capable of establishing bona fides at the time of marriage. The weight to be afforded to such evidence is a decision to be made after hearing the evidence. [emphasis added]
[73]
I think the Applicant is also correct to say that continued contact between the parties can constitute fresh evidence, and the IAD has found it sufficient in the past to refuse the application of
res judicata
. In
Singh
, above, at paragraphs 32 to 34, the IAD found the length of the marriage between the parties indicated their marriage was genuine. The IAD had this to say on point:
The panel does not feel bound to consider only the new evidence. The panel did not hear the previous matter. It cannot look behind the reasoning of the panel at that time. The panel has conducted a hearing de novo and considered all the evidence, both new and old, and the submissions of the parties and made a new decision.
The panel makes no apologies for its decision nor does it attempt to distinguish its reasoning from that of the previous panel which speaks for itself on the evidence that the panel considered in the same way this decision speaks for itself on the evidence that this panel considered.
The appellant and applicant have been married since April 2002. Their marriage has endured over five years despite two refusal and two appeals. All the indicia typically considered by the IAD in assessing the genuineness of a marriage are present and to a greater and lesser degree the indicia are positive. The evidence speaks to a relationship entered into on the basis of a traditional arranged marriage. The respective families were involved in the arrangement which, while compact in time, does not suggest an attempt to hide the marriage. The evidence considered today was found credible and it answered the concerns raised by the visa officer.
When considered in its totality
the evidence does not support a conclusion that the marriage was entered into in bad faith. [emphasis added]
[74]
As the Applicant points out, her marriage to her husband has endured even longer than the five-year marriage in
Singh
. The Applicant has been married to her husband since 2004, throughout both sponsorship refusals and both IAD appeals. Unlike IAD Member Patel, the IAD in
Singh
considered the entirety of the evidence rather than conducting a piecemeal analysis of each category of evidence.
[75]
Also of relevance to this case is that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the IAD considered new evidence of visits to India, the couple spending time together, photos, and the documentation to show their communication through the Internet and mail and concluded that this new evidence was sufficient to refuse the application of
res judicata
. Similarly, in
Patel
, above, the IAD considered evidence of trips to India, time spent with the spouse's family in India, photos, and proof of continuous contact when deciding that
res judicata
should not apply.
[76]
I agree with the Respondent that each case has to be decided on its facts and that previous decisions of the IAD do not constitute binding precedents. However, they are indicative of the kind of evidence that can be used to overcome
res judicata
and of what is likely to be persuasive. In the present case, the Applicant presented substantial evidence to show her commitment to her husband in the years following her first IAD appeal in 2007. Her husband had moved temporarily to the USA for work from 2007 until 2010. Since they were closer to each other, the Applicant was able to visit her husband more often, and saw him several times each year. Proof of the trips to the USA, a joint bank account, money transfers, telephone bills, photos, and gifts bought for each other were submitted to the IAD in counsel's submissions on 14 February 2011. In addition, the Applicant's longer trip to India in 2011 was also put forward as proof of her subsequent commitment to her husband, and evidence of the trip was faxed to the IAD on the 5 July 2011.
[77]
The Decision shows that the IAD rejected the Applicant's proof of her trips to see her husband, her photographs, and phone records, because the same type of evidence had been adduced at the first IAD appeal. However, what seems to have been left out of account here is the point made in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, that continuous communication, and the length of the relationship between the parties could have changed the result of the first appeal. As the Applicant points out, some of the evidence submitted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , was the same type that was submitted in the first appeal, but the IAD still accepted the new evidence because it went to the genuineness of the marriage.
[78]
I agree with the Applicant that there is considerable jurisprudence to support the notion that proof of subsequent commitment can represent proof a marriage was genuine when it was entered into. The Applicant and Dhindsa adduced evidence to show that they have strengthened their marriage over the past seven years, and that they continue to be committed to their relationship. They provided substantial documentation to the IAD to show their commitment towards one another. There is also jurisprudence that new evidence can be relevant, even if the same type of evidence was submitted at the first appeal.
[79]
If a relationship is genuine and continues over time, it stands to reason that more photographs, cards, letters, and telephone bills will become available. Although evidence of the same kind may have been introduced before, it speaks to an aspect of the marriage which was not previously present: the commitment over time. Also, in this case, the IAD appears to have completely disregarded the evidence of the Applicant's most recent trip to India. I accept the Applicant's position that the IAD unreasonably erred in its assessment of the facts and ignored the existence of fresh and decisive evidence.
[80]
The Respondent takes the position that the IAD had the discretion to determine whether, in the circumstances of this case, the evidence the Applicant provided constituted new evidence which would allow the exception to the application of
res judicata
. The Respondent says it was reasonable for the IAD to determine that the evidence put forward as a result of the length of time that had passed in the alleged relationship did not amount to decisive new evidence of the Couple having lived together, of their intention to reside together permanently, or of a deeper relationship.
[81]
I agree that the IAD has this discretion. However, I think the Applicant is right to say that the IAD failed to consider the evidence as a whole, even though it addressed the concerns expressed at the first IAD appeal. Counsel for the Applicant submitted evidence that addressed the major concerns at the first appeal, namely the Applicant's knowledge of her husband's family, and the Couple's intent at the time of marriage. As the Applicant points out, the evidence she submitted pertained to the following important issues:
Cohabitation in the USA and India
Dhindsa moved to be closer to the Applicant
[82]
The Applicant's husband made a significant change in his life when he obtained a visa to work in the USA from 2007 to 2010. His primary purpose for selecting the USA as his place of employment was to be closer to his wife. The Applicant submitted new evidence of Dhindsa's move to the USA, including his American visa, with the second sponsorship. She also provided significant documentary evidence including boarding passes, photos, bus tickets, hotel receipts, purchase receipts and itineraries as proof of her trips to the USA, as well as proof of the Couple's visit to one another during that period. The Applicant's husband also bonded with the Applicant's daughter when the Applicant flew to the USA to visit him in June 2007.
Applicant visited India in 2011
[83]
The Applicant spent time with Dhindsa and his family in her most recent trip to India from April 22, 2011 to May 15, 2011. This trip addressed concerns from the first appeal about the Applicant's knowledge of her husband's family.
Ongoing Communication between the Couple
[84]
All telephone bills submitted by Applicant's counsel dated from after the first refusal and demonstrated the constant communication between the Applicant and her husband.
Applicant's Knowledge of Dhindsa's Family
[85]
The photos the Applicant submitted show her and Dhindsa enjoying each other's company on their various trips to see one another. They also show the Applicant spending time with Dhindsa's family in India. These photographs directly address the first IAD Panel's concerns about the Applicant's knowledge of her husband's family and their intent at the time of marriage.
Ongoing Financial Support
Joint Account and Money Transfers
[86]
The Applicant submitted proof of her and Dhindsa's joint bank account as well as money transfers that show that she received financial support from him after the first appeal.
Receipts from purchases
[87]
Several receipts from items purchased together while the Applicant and her husband visited each other in the USA demonstrate the time they spent together and further corroborate evidence of their visits from 2007-2010.
Conclusion
[88]
Considered collectively, I agree with the Applicant the evidence she submitted directly addressed the IAD's initial concerns about the Couple's intentions at the time of their marriage, and the Applicant's knowledge of her husband's family. They have cohabited numerous times since the first IAD appeal, maintained ongoing communication, and have shown some financial dependence on one another.
[89]
All in all, I think the Applicant has made her case for reviewable error on this central issue.
[90]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[91]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is allowed, the decision is quashed and the matter is referred back to a differently constituted IAD for reconsideration.
2. There is no question for certification.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Russell
[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande présentée en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), sollicitant le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision, datée du 25 juillet 2011 (la décision), par laquelle la Section d'appel de l'immigration (la SAI) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a déclaré que l'appel de la demanderesse interjeté à l'encontre de la décision d'un agent des visas (le deuxième agent) au bureau des visas de Buffalo, dans l'État de New York, était chose jugée et a refusé de l'instruire.
CONTEXTE
[2]
La demanderesse est née aux Fidji et est citoyenne canadienne. Son mari (Dhindsa) est un citoyen de l'Inde.
[3]
En 2005, la demanderesse a présenté une demande de parrainage afin de faire venir Dhindsa au Canada à titre de résident permanent dans la catégorie du regroupement familial. Un agent (le premier agent) de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC) a rejeté cette demande après avoir conclu que le mariage de Dhindsa et de la demanderesse (le couple) n'était pas authentique au sens de l'article 4 du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 (le Règlement). La demanderesse a interjeté appel de cette décision à la SAI, laquelle a rejeté son appel (le premier appel) le 29 août 2007. La demanderesse n'a pas sollicité le contrôle judiciaire de cette décision.
[4]
La demanderesse a présenté une deuxième demande de parrainage conjugal le 2 mars 2009 afin de faire venir Dhindsa au Canada (la deuxième demande). Avant de rendre une décision sur ce dossier, CIC a souligné que les préoccupations exprimées dans le premier appel concernant les convictions religieuses différentes du couple existaient toujours dans la deuxième demande. CIC estimait que le travail de Dhindsa comme prêtre sikh était incompatible avec son mariage avec la demanderesse, qui est de religion hindoue. Après avoir interrogé Dhindsa, le 2 septembre 2010, un agent d'immigration (le deuxième agent) du bureau des visas de Buffalo a rejeté la deuxième demande, concluant lui aussi que le mariage du couple n'était pas authentique au sens du Règlement. La demanderesse a interjeté appel de cette décision à la SAI.
[5]
Avant l'audition de l'appel formé par la demanderesse à l'égard de la décision du deuxième agent, la SAI a avisé la demanderesse, le 17 janvier 2011, qu'il lui semblait que par ce second appel, elle tentait de rouvrir des questions sur lesquelles la SAI s'était déjà prononcée. La SAI a invité la demanderesse à aborder cette question dans ses observations écrites, lesquelles ont été produites le 14 février 2011.
[6]
Dans ces observations, la demanderesse a déclaré qu'elle disposait d'éléments de preuve nouveaux et déterminants qu'elle n'aurait pu présenter lors du premier appel. Elle a précisé qu'elle n'était pas représentée lors du premier appel et qu'elle croyait alors qu'elle ne pouvait faire témoigner Dhindsa. Elle a également déclaré qu'elle avait d'autres éléments de preuve de sa relation continue avec Dhindsa et a demandé à la SAI d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'instruire le second appel au fond. Elle a ajouté que le refus d'entendre le second appel créerait une injustice parce que les époux seraient tenus de vivre dans des pays distincts. Elle a aussi présenté à la SAI les éléments de preuve qu'elle entendait invoquer.
[7]
Le défendeur a présenté des observations sur la question de la chose jugée le 29 avril 2011. Il a de plus déclaré que les éléments de preuve soumis par la demanderesse étaient postérieurs au premier appel et ne prouvaient pas que le mariage du couple était authentique lorsqu'il a été contracté. Le défendeur a également indiqué que la demanderesse avait choisi de ne pas faire témoigner Dhindsa lors du premier appel. Le témoignage de Dhindsa ne saurait être considéré comme un nouvel élément de preuve, puisque la demanderesse aurait pu appeler son époux comme témoin dans le cadre du premier appel.
[8]
La demanderesse a répondu aux observations du défendeur le 17 mai 2011, déclarant que la preuve d'une relation continue pouvait témoigner d'un engagement au moment du mariage. Elle a redemandé à la SAI d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'entendre son appel.
[9]
La SAI a examiné les observations des parties et, le 25 juillet 2011, elle a refusé d'exercer son pouvoir d'entendre l'appel de la demanderesse parce que le principe de la chose jugée s'appliquait. La SAI a avisé la demanderesse de sa décision le 2 août 2011.
DÉCISION CONTRÔLÉE
[10]
La SAI a indiqué que l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , établit le critère à trois volets suivant pour l'application du principe de la préclusion découlant d'une question déjà tranchée, lequel exige:
a. que la même question ait été décidée;
b. que la décision judiciaire invoquée comme créant la préclusion soit finale;
c. que les parties dans la décision antérieure invoquée, ou leurs ayants droit, soient les mêmes que les parties engagées dans l'affaire où la préclusion est soulevée.
[11]
La SAI a conclu que les trois éléments étaient réunis en l'espèce. La décision de la SAI dans le premier appel était finale et la demanderesse n'a pas demandé le contrôle judiciaire de cette décision. Dans le second appel, les parties étaient les mêmes: le défendeur et la demanderesse. Enfin, la question en jeu est la même dans les deux appels: celle de savoir si le mariage du couple était authentique.
[12]
La SPR a également indiqué que, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu que l'objectif fondamental de la préclusion découlant d'une question déjà tranchée était d'établir l'équilibre entre l'intérêt public qui consiste à assurer le caractère définitif des litiges et l'autre intérêt public qui est d'assurer que, dans une affaire donnée, justice soit rendue. Dans l'arrêt
Danyluk,
la Cour suprême du Canada a également conclu que pour empêcher qu'une injustice ne soit commise, les décideurs avaient le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'entendre les affaires auxquelles la préclusion découlant d'une affaire déjà tranchée s'appliquerait autrement. La SAI a mentionné plusieurs facteurs à prendre en considération à l'égard de ce pouvoir discrétionnaire, notamment: le libellé du texte de loi accordant le pouvoir au décideur, les garanties offertes aux parties, l'existence d'un droit d'appel, l'expertise du décideur, les circonstances ayant donné naissance à l'instance initiale et le risque d'injustice.
Application des facteurs
[13]
Après avoir conclu que les trois conditions d'application de la préclusion étaient réunies dans le cas de la demanderesse, la SAI s'est demandé si elle devait exercer son pouvoir d'entendre quand même l'appel. La SAI a indiqué qu'elle avait déjà reconnu que de nouveaux renseignements pouvaient empêcher l'application de la préclusion et que les décisions de la SAI n'étaient pas susceptibles d'appel. La demanderesse pouvait toutefois présenter une demande de contrôle judiciaire à la Cour. Elle a ajouté qu'elle était un tribunal compétent, spécialisé dans le domaine de l'immigration, y compris les appels en matière de parrainage. Elle a de plus conclu que les circonstances qui ont mené au second appel étaient les mêmes que celles à l'origine du premier appel, et que le seul changement important concernait le temps qui s'était écoulé depuis.
[14]
La SAI a mentionné que, dans ses observations sur la question de la chose jugée, la demanderesse a fait valoir qu'il [traduction] « existe de nouveaux éléments de preuve visant à démontrer que [son] mariage [avec Dhindsa] est authentique, et que ces éléments de preuve n'auraient pu être présentés dans le cadre de l'instance précédente, même avec diligence raisonnable ». Pour déterminer si elle devait exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'entendre le second appel, la SAI a estimé qu'elle devait examiner la possibilité qu'il y ait un risque d'injustice pour la demanderesse le cas advenant qu'elle n'entende pas l'appel. Plus particulièrement, la SAI s'est attardée sur la question de l'existence de nouveaux éléments de preuve et de la possibilité qu'il y ait injustice si ces éléments de preuve n'étaient pas pris en compte.
Nouveaux éléments de preuve et injustice
[15]
Afin de déterminer si les éléments de preuve présentés par la demanderesse étaient nouveaux, la SAI a appliqué le critère établi par la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à savoir que l'on ne devrait pas admettre de nouveaux éléments de preuve qui, avec diligence raisonnable, auraient pu être présentés lors de la première instance; les éléments de preuve doivent porter sur une question décisive ou potentiellement décisive; les éléments de preuve doivent être plausibles et, s'ils sont admis, ils auraient influé sur le résultat de l'instance précédente.
[16]
La SAI a indiqué que, selon la demanderesse, les nouveaux éléments de preuve démontraient que les époux entretenaient une relation continue, ce qui établissait l'authenticité de leur engagement au moment où ils se sont mariés. La SAI a ajouté que lors du premier appel, elle avait conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas dissipé les doutes du premier agent et que son témoignage en avait soulevé d'autres. Le deuxième agent a conclu que les préoccupations déjà soulevées lors du premier appel subsistaient. Dans sa lettre de refus, le deuxième agent a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas réussi à apaiser ses préoccupations quant à l'authenticité du mariage du couple.
[17]
La SAI a mentionné que la demanderesse avait affirmé qu'elle ne savait pas qu'elle pouvait faire témoigner Dhindsa lors du premier appel parce qu'elle agissait alors pour son propre compte. La SAI a conclu que la demanderesse avait choisi de ne pas être représentée et de ne pas faire appeler Dhindsa comme témoin. La SAI a avisé la demanderesse, avant le premier appel, qu'elle pouvait être représentée par un conseil et elle a conclu que le fait qu'elle ait depuis retenu les services d'un conseil et qu'elle souhaitait assigner Dhindsa comme témoin dans le second appel ne constituait pas un nouvel élément de preuve. De plus, la SAI a conclu que la demanderesse aurait pu prévoir quelles seraient les préoccupations exprimées par la SAI lors du premier appel.
[18]
La SAI a également conclu que la demanderesse a compris à la première audience qu'elle pouvait faire comparaître Dhindsa comme témoin. En tant qu'épouse, elle devait avoir compris que Dhindsa était aussi bien placé qu'elle pour témoigner de l'authenticité de leur mariage. En outre, il lui incombait alors d'établir que son mariage était authentique. Rien ne l'empêchait d'appeler Dhindsa à témoigner.
[19]
La SAI a de plus conclu qu'aucune injustice ne serait commise si la demanderesse ne pouvait faire témoigner Dhindsa dans une deuxième instance. La demanderesse a choisi de ne pas faire assigner Dhindsa comme témoin et le témoignage de Dhindsa ne saurait être déterminant quant à l'issue de l'appel. La SAI a déclaré qu'il a été établi dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire d'entendre le témoignage du demandeur, de sorte qu'il n'était pas nécessaire que la SAI entende le témoignage de Dhindsa.
[20]
La SAI a également examiné les éléments de preuve présentés par la demanderesse lors du second appel, lesquels, selon cette dernière, démontraient que son mariage était authentique. La SAI a conclu qu'elle avait examiné des éléments de preuve semblables lors du premier appel et que ceux-ci ne permettaient pas d'établir l'authenticité du mariage du couple. Elle a aussi conclu que les photographies présentées par la demanderesse lors du second appel ne permettaient pas d'établir l'authenticité du mariage. Les reçus attestant des virements d'argent présentés par la demanderesse n'étaient pas non plus déterminants quant à l'authenticité du mariage du couple.
[21]
Bien que la demanderesse ait fourni des relevés téléphoniques lors du second appel, la SAI a conclu qu'ils ne faisaient qu'ajouter d'autres éléments de preuve à ceux dont elle disposait lors du premier appel et n'apportaient rien de nouveau. Ces éléments n'étaient ni nouveaux ni déterminants quant à la question en cause. La SAI a aussi indiqué que la première formation avait exprimé certaines préoccupations à l'égard des mêmes éléments de preuve. Elle a conclu, lors du second appel, que les éléments de preuve supplémentaires ne répondaient pas à ces préoccupations.
Conclusion
[22]
La SAI a conclu que les éléments de preuve présentés par la demanderesse lors du second appel ne constituaient pas de nouveaux éléments de preuve déterminants qui permettraient de conclure que les époux avaient vécu ensemble, qu'ils avaient l'intention d'habiter ensemble de façon permanente ou qu'ils entretenaient une relation profonde. Ces éléments de preuve ne répondaient pas aux préoccupations de la SAI soulevées à l'occasion du premier appel à l'égard de l'intention du couple au moment du mariage. Le premier appel a été rejeté parce que le couple n'a pas dissipé ces préoccupations, même s'il a eu la possibilité raisonnable de le faire.
[23]
La SAI a conclu que les trois volets du critère permettant d'établir le principe de la chose jugée étaient réunis et, qu'en raison du fait que les éléments de preuve supplémentaires présentés par la demanderesse n'étaient pas nouveaux ou déterminants, il n'était pas dans l'intérêt de la justice d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'entendre le second appel. Les questions entourant l'authenticité du mariage du couple avaient été évaluées adéquatement lors du premier appel.
[24]
La SAI a décliné compétence et a rejeté le second appel.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[25]
La demanderesse soulève les questions suivantes:
a. La SAI a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que la demanderesse n'avait pas présenté de nouveaux éléments de preuve?
b. La SAI a-t-elle omis d'examiner si elle devait exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'instruire le second appel, même si le critère relatif au principe de la chose jugée était respecté?
c. Les motifs de la SAI sont-ils suffisants?
NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[26]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu qu'il n'est pas nécessaire dans tous les cas de faire une analyse visant à déterminer la norme de contrôle applicable. Lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à une question qui est soumise à la cour est bien établie par la jurisprudence, la cour chargée du contrôle peut adopter cette norme. Ce n'est que lorsque cette recherche se révèle infructueuse que la juridiction de contrôle doit entreprendre l'examen des quatre facteurs constituant l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle.
[27]
La première question que soulève la demanderesse, celle de savoir si les éléments de preuve qu'elle a présentés à l'occasion du second appel étaient nouveaux, est une question qui soulève des questions de fait et de droit inextricablement liées. La SAI était appelée à déterminer si la preuve soumise par la demanderesse était pertinente ou déterminante quant à la question soulevée dans le second appel. Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 51, la Cour suprême du Canada a statué que de telles questions doivent être examinées selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La norme de contrôle applicable à la première question est celle de la raisonnabilité.
[28]
En ce qui a trait à la troisième question, la Cour suprême du Canada a récemment statué que l'insuffisance des motifs ne permettait pas à elle seule de casser une décision (voir Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En fait,« les motifs doivent être examinés en corrélation avec le résultat et ils doivent permettre de savoir si ce dernier fait partie des issues possibles ». Les motifs de la SAI doivent donc être analysés en tenant compte du caractère raisonnable de la décision dans son ensemble.
[29]
Lorsque le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision repose sur la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse s'attachera « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Autrement dit, la Cour n'interviendra que si la décision est déraisonnable, c'est-à-dire qu'elle n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
[30]
La norme de contrôle applicable à la deuxième question est celle de la décision correcte. Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour suprême du Canada a statué comme suit au paragraphe 66: « L'appelante a droit à ce que, à un certain point dans le processus, on examine de façon appropriée les facteurs pertinents à l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire[dans l'analyse relative au principe de la chose jugée]. » Lorsque les trois conditions d'application du principe de la chose jugée sont réunies, le décideur est alors tenu de se demander s'il doit exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'instruire quand même l'affaire. La cour de révision est appelée à examiner si le décideur a respecté cette obligation et n'acquiesce pas au raisonnement du décideur ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 50).

ARGUMENTATION DES PARTIES
La demanderesse
La SAI a déraisonnablement conclu que les éléments de preuve soumis n'étaient pas nouveaux
[33]
La demanderesse affirme que la SAI a conclu de façon déraisonnable que les éléments de preuve qu'elle a présentés à l'appui du second appel n'étaient ni nouveaux ni déterminants. Bien que la SAI ait analysé chaque élément de preuve que la demanderesse a présenté, elle n'a pas évalué si, dans son ensemble, la preuve démontrait que le mariage du couple était authentique.
[34]
Elle affirme que les nouveaux éléments de preuve démontrent que son mariage était bel et bien authentique. Elle a fourni la preuve d'un voyage récent en Inde qui, selon elle, répond à la préoccupation exprimée par la SAI lors du premier appel, à savoir que le fait que les époux aient des antécédents différents jetait un doute sur l'authenticité de leur mariage.
[35]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la SAI a écrit ce qui suit, aux paragraphes 33 et 34:
L'appelant et la demandeure sont mariés depuis avril 2002. Leur mariage a perduré plus de cinq années, en dépit de deux rejets et de deux appels. Tous les facteurs normalement pris en considération par la SAI pour évaluer l'authenticité d'un mariage sont présents et de façon plus ou moins marquée, les facteurs sont favorables. La preuve fait état d'une relation établie sur la base d'un mariage traditionnel arrangé. Les familles respectives ont participé à l'organisation du mariage qui, bien que contracté en peu de temps, ne permet pas d'affirmer qu'ils ont tenté de cacher ce mariage. La preuve examinée aujourd'hui a été jugée crédible et elle a satisfait aux préoccupations soulevées par l'agent des visas.
Lorsqu'elle est examinée dans son ensemble, la preuve ne permet pas de conclure qu'il s'agit d'un mariage contracté de mauvaise foi. Le tribunal conclut, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le mariage est authentique et qu'il ne visait pas principalement à favoriser l'immigration de la demandeure au Canada.
[36]
La décision
Singh
nous enseigne qu'une relation continue entre les parties à un mariage peut constituer un nouvel élément de preuve que ce mariage est authentique. Le mariage du couple a duré plus longtemps que le mariage à l'étude dans la décision
Singh
. La SAI aurait donc dû conclure, lors du second appel, que la durée du mariage du couple constituait un nouvel élément de preuve. La durée du mariage du couple est un élément qui faisait partie de l'ensemble de la preuve qui établissait l'authenticité du mariage.
[37]
La demanderesse a présenté des éléments de preuve substantiels afin de démontrer son engagement envers Dhindsa depuis le rejet du premier appel par la SAI. Dhindsa a déménagé aux États-Unis pour se rapprocher d'elle et elle-même a fait un long voyage en Inde en 2011 pour être avec lui. Ces deux événements témoignent d'un engagement soutenu l'un envers l'autre, mais la SAI a conclu qu'il ne s'agissait pas de nouveaux éléments de preuve. S'appuyant sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la demanderesse fait valoir que, dans cette affaire, la SAI a conclu que la preuve d'un voyage et du temps que les conjoints ont passé ensemble était suffisante pour échapper à l'application du principe de la chose jugée. Elle affirme que la même décision que dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> aurait dû être prononcée à son égard. La SAI a également rejeté des éléments de preuve relatifs à des appels téléphoniques et aux voyages faits par la demanderesse pour voir Dhindsa parce qu'il s'agissait du même type d'éléments de preuve que ceux présentés lors du premier appel. La demanderesse renvoie cependant à
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  où la SAI a accepté des éléments de preuve du même type que ceux présentés dans un appel antérieur parce que ces éléments étaient pertinents quant à l'authenticité du mariage en cause dans cette affaire.
[38]
La demanderesse fait valoir qu'elle n'était pas représentée lors du premier appel et qu'elle ne comprenait pas alors ses droits, ce qui l'a empêchée de convoquer Dhindsa comme témoin. La demanderesse renvoie à l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  avec laquelle la SAI a établi une distinction dans la décision. La demanderesse se trouve dans une situation semblable à celle qui prévalait dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> parce qu'elle aussi a présenté des éléments de preuve nouveaux et déterminants.
La SAI ne s'est pas penchée sur l'existence de circonstances spéciales
[39]
La SAI a terminé son analyse par la conclusion que le principe de la chose jugée s'appliquait sans avoir abordé la question de savoir si des circonstances spéciales justifiaient l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'entendre le second appel. La demanderesse renvoie à
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  qui, à son avis, établit que la SAI doit envisager d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'instruire un appel lorsque les trois conditions d'application de la préclusion découlant d'une question déjà tranchée sont réunies. La demanderesse s'appuie sur
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pour affirmer que le risque d'injustice est un facteur pouvant inciter la SAI à exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'entendre un appel dans un cas où le principe de la chose jugée s'appliquerait.
[40]
Plutôt que de se demander si elle devait exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire et entendre le second appel, la SAI a plutôt considéré le critère à trois volets applicable en matière de préclusion découlant d'une question déjà tranchée. La SAI s'est exprimée comme suit:
Le tribunal examinera la possibilité qu'il y ait un risque d'injustice le cas advenant que la SAI n'entendrait pas l'appel interjeté contre le deuxième refus de la demande de visa de résident permanent [de Dhindsa]. Plus précisément, le tribunal déterminera s'il existe en l'espèce de « nouveaux » éléments de preuve conformes au critère qui les régit, démontrant l'existence d'une exception à l'application du principe de la chose jugée.
[41]
Les circonstances de l'espèce indiquent que la SAI aurait dû exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire et entendre le second appel. La demanderesse souligne le fait que les parties sont un particulier et la Couronne et soutient que le refus de la SAI d'entendre son appel causera une injustice parce que le couple ne sera pas en mesure de vivre ensemble dans le même pays. La demanderesse ne peut déménager en Inde pour vivre avec Dhindsa parce qu'elle a des problèmes de santé lorsqu'elle s'y trouve et qu'elle n'a pas de statut dans ce pays. Les intérêts que la SAI devait pondérer étaient l'intérêt de l'État dans l'administration de la justice et l'intérêt de la demanderesse à ce que son époux et elle puissent être réunis.
[42]
Même si la SAI a tenu compte de la prétention de la demanderesse selon laquelle le couple ne serait pas en mesure de vivre ensemble, elle a précisé que la Loi ne garantissait pas la réunification des familles. Or, la réunification des familles est un objectif important de la Loi en vertu de l'alinéa 3(1)
d
). Y faire obstacle crée un risque d'injustice dont la SAI devrait tenir compte lorsqu'elle envisage d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'instruire une affaire. La SAI aurait dû accorder de l'importance à la réunification du couple lorsqu'elle s'est penchée sur l'opportunité d'entendre le second appel.
Le défendeur
[43]
Le défendeur soutient que la SAI a exercé de façon raisonnable son pouvoir discrétionnaire de ne pas entendre le second appel. La SAI a examiné les éléments de preuve soumis par la demanderesse et a conclu qu'ils ne répondaient pas aux préoccupations soulevées lors du premier appel. La demanderesse ne partage tout simplement pas la conclusion de la SAI de sorte que la Cour ne devrait pas intervenir.
Les conditions d'application du principe de la chose jugée sont réunies
[44]
La SAI a conclu de façon raisonnable que les trois conditions d'application, établies dans l'arrêt
Angle
, précité, étaient réunies à l'égard du second appel. La même question se posait et dans le premier et dans le deuxième appel: le mariage du couple était-il authentique? Les parties étaient aussi les mêmes et le premier appel a donné lieu à une décision finale quant à cette question. Selon le défendeur, l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, établit que lorsque les trois conditions d'application sont réunies, le principe de la chose jugée doit s'appliquer à moins que des circonstances spéciales ne justifient le décideur d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'entendre l'affaire au fond.
Examen raisonnable de l'existence de circonstances spéciales
[45]
La SAI a vérifié s'il existait une exception à l'application du principe de la chose jugée et a mentionné certains facteurs que les décideurs peuvent prendre en compte lorsqu'ils se penchent sur l'opportunité d'exercer leur pouvoir discrétionnaire d'entendre une affaire au fond. Lorsqu'elle a examiné si la demanderesse avait présenté de nouveaux éléments de preuve, la SAI s'est demandé si le refus d'entendre le second appel créerait une injustice. Dans son examen du caractère nouveau des éléments de preuve, la SAI a appliqué de façon raisonnable le critère formulé par la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt
Public School Boards' Assn
, précité. Tout ce que la demanderesse dans le cadre de sa plaidoirie a été de répéter les arguments qu'elle avait présentés à la SAI. Elle n'a pas démontré que la SAI avait exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire de façon déraisonnable.
Les éléments de preuve ne sont pas nouveaux
[46]
Bien que la demanderesse ait soutenu avoir présenté de nouveaux éléments de preuve concernant sa relation avec Dhindsa, la SAI a conclu que ce n'était pas le cas. La SAI a conclu que les éléments de preuve présentés par la demanderesse l'avaient déjà été lors du premier appel, qu'ils n'étaient pas déterminants et qu'ils ne répondaient pas à ses préoccupations. La SAI a aussi conclu qu'elle avait examiné en détail la question de l'authenticité du mariage du couple lors du premier appel. Bien que la demanderesse ait souhaité faire témoigner Dhindsa dans le cadre du second appel et ait déclaré qu'elle ne savait pas qu'il aurait pu témoigner lors du premier appel, la SAI a conclu qu'il lui incombait d'établir le bien-fondé de sa cause et qu'elle avait alors choisi de ne pas l'appeler à témoigner. Il s'agissait d'une conclusion raisonnable de la part de la SAI.
[47]
La SAI a également conclu de façon raisonnable que le fait que Dhindsa n'ait pas témoigné dénotait un manquement dans le plaidoyer de la demanderesse lors du premier appel et que le témoignage de Dhindsa ne constituait pas un nouvel élément de preuve lors du second appel. La SAI a indiqué qu'elle n'avait pas tiré de conclusion défavorable du fait que Dhindsa n'avait pas témoigné lors du premier appel et a conclu que la demanderesse ne subirait aucun préjudice si encore une fois il ne pouvait pas témoigner. La SAI a aussi rejeté de façon raisonnable la prétention de la demanderesse selon laquelle elle ne savait pas qu'elle pouvait recourir aux services d'un conseil. La SAI a mentionné que l'avis d'appel qu'elle lui avait envoyé précisait qu'elle avait le droit d'être représentée par un conseil lors du premier appel.
[48]
De même, la SAI a conclu de façon raisonnable que les éléments de preuve soumise par la demanderesse quant à la relation continue du couple ne constituaient pas de nouveaux éléments de preuve démontrant que les époux avaient l'intention de vivre ensemble de façon permanente. La SAI n'était pas tenue de suivre ses décisions antérieures, citées par la demanderesse, parce qu'elles ne permettent pas de savoir si les éléments de preuve présentés en l'espèce étaient nouveaux ou déterminants. Il n'appartient pas à la Cour de comparer la preuve soumise en l'espèce et celle soumise dans d'autres affaires; elle doit décider si la conclusion de la SAI en l'espèce était raisonnable compte tenu du dossier dont elle disposait.
[49]
Le défendeur soutient que l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  est semblable à celle de l'espèce. La juge Judith Snider a statué comme suit au paragraphe 19:
[...] les motifs qu'avait la SAI de rejeter le premier appel intéressaient des éléments que n'abordaient pas les preuves nouvelles produites par la demanderesse. En conséquence, il était à tout le moins loisible à la deuxième formation de la SAI de conclure qu'il n'existait aucune preuve nouvelle décisive qui fût susceptible de justifier l'annulation de la décision de la première formation. Je ne pense pas qu'il était manifestement déraisonnable pour la seconde formation de la SAI de dire qu'il n'existait pas de circonstances qui justifiaient l'audition de l'affaire au fond.
[50]
La conclusion de la SAI, que la Cour a maintenue dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , est semblable à la conclusion que conteste la demanderesse en l'espèce. Le résultat devrait être le même.
[51]
La SAI a fondé sa décision sur une analyse de la preuve dans son ensemble:
Plus important encore, tous ces éléments de preuve ne changent en rien les préoccupations du tribunal précédent à l'égard de l'intention des époux, notamment en ce qui concerne les connaissances déficientes et le désintérêt de l'appelante relativement à la famille [de Dhindsa], et son manque de connaissance à propos de ses amis.
[52]
La SAI n'était pas tenue de mentionner chaque élément de preuve présenté par la demanderesse ni d'expliquer les raisons pour lesquelles elle ne l'acceptait pas. La SAI a tenu compte de l'ensemble de la preuve, mais cela n'était pas suffisant pour la convaincre de l'authenticité du mariage du couple. La demanderesse est tout simplement en désaccord avec la SAI quant à la façon dont celle-ci a soupesé les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait, ce qui ne peut faire l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire.
Autres circonstances
[53]
Non seulement la SAI s'est demandé si les éléments de preuve de la demanderesse étaient nouveaux, mais elle a également examiné la prétention de la demanderesse suivant laquelle le couple pouvait uniquement vivre ensemble au Canada. La SAI a tenu compte de cet élément des observations de la demanderesse, mais a conclu qu'il n'était pas dans l'intérêt de la justice qu'elle entende le second appel.
Réponse de la demanderesse
[54]
La demanderesse soutient que son argumentation ne vise pas la façon dont la SAI a soupesé les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait. Elle fait plutôt valoir que la SAI n'a pas examiné la preuve dans son ensemble, même si celle-ci répondait aux préoccupations exprimées par la SAI lors du premier appel. Elle affirme que le déménagement de Dhindsa aux États-Unis démontrait que leur mariage était authentique, tout comme les relevés téléphoniques qu'elle a présentés. La date figurant sur ces relevés était postérieure au premier appel, de sorte qu'ils démontraient l'engagement continu des époux l'un envers l'autre. De plus, les photographies sur lesquelles les époux apparaissaient ensemble avec la famille de Dhindsa indiquent que la demanderesse connaissait celle-ci, ce dont doutait la SAI lors du premier appel. Dans l'ensemble, les éléments de preuve présentés par la demanderesse répondaient aux préoccupations exprimées par la SAI lors du premier appel. La SAI aurait donc dû exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire et entendre le second appel.
Motifs insuffisants
[55]
La demanderesse soutient également que dans ses motifs, la SAI n'a pas traité de façon adéquate tous les éléments de preuve soumis. Il était insuffisant pour la SAI de déclarer qu'elle avait examiné l'ensemble de la preuve. La SAI n'a pas mentionné que la demanderesse avait vécu avec Dhindsa pendant un mois en 2011. Il s'agissait là d'un élément de preuve qui contredisait ses conclusions, et suivant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  elle était tenue de s'y intéresser. La décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  nous enseigne que l'engagement qui à long terme peut établir l'authenticité d'un mariage.
[56]
De plus, la SAI n'a pas expliqué dans ses motifs pourquoi l'ensemble de la preuve soumise par la demanderesse lors du second appel ne répondait pas aux questions soulevées dans le premier appel. Le simple fait pour la SAI de dire que la preuve ne dissipait pas ces préoccupations ne suffisait pas. La demanderesse fait valoir que le défendeur a reconnu que la SAI avait considéré plusieurs éléments de preuve de façon individuelle. En effet, la SAI a examiné chaque élément de preuve isolément, ce qui fait qu'elle a tiré une conclusion déraisonnable.
Demanderesse non représentée
[57]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la demanderesse prétend aussi que la SAI doit veiller à ce que les parties non représentées bénéficient d'une audience équitable. Le témoignage de Dhindsa aurait pu servir à clarifier les questions qui préoccupaient la SAI lors du premier appel.
La jurisprudence
[58]
Bien que le défendeur prétende que la SAI n'était pas liée par les décisions antérieures citées par la demanderesse, la SAI n'a pas tenu compte de la façon dont cette jurisprudence établissait la pertinence des éléments de preuve que la demanderesse avait soumis. Il ressort de la jurisprudence citée par la demanderesse que la preuve d'une relation continue peut démontrer qu'un mariage était authentique lorsqu'il a été contracté, ce que la SAI n'a pas examiné en l'espèce.
[59]
La décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> qui, selon le défendeur, devrait dicter l'issue de la présente affaire, se distingue par ses faits. Bien que la juge Snider ait maintenu la conclusion de la SAI selon laquelle la preuve dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne répondait pas aux préoccupations exprimées par la SAI lors du premier appel, la demanderesse soutient que la preuve présentée en l'espèce y répondait. Par conséquent, la SAI aurait dû exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire et entendre le second appel.
Risque d'injustice
[60]
Bien que la SAI ait déclaré qu'elle analyserait le dossier de la demanderesse en fonction de l'injustice que pourrait créer le refus d'examiner les nouveaux éléments de preuve soumis par la demanderesse, cette dernière soutient que la SAI n'a apprécié que certains des éléments soumis lors du second appel. La SAI ne s'est pas demandé s'il y aurait injustice advenant qu'elle refuse d'entendre le second appel. La SAI n'a pas tenu compte du risque que le couple soit séparé si elle n'entendait pas le second appel, ce qui rend sa décision déraisonnable.
ANALYSE
[61]
Dans la décision, la SAI a conclu que les conditions d'application de la préclusion, telles qu'énoncées dans
Angle
, précité, étaient réunies:
Le tribunal est convaincu, à la lumière des renseignements dont il dispose, que les conditions d'application de la préclusion sont réunies en l'espèce. Premièrement, la décision antérieure de la SAI était finale. Il n'y a eu aucune demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision précédente. Deuxièmement, les parties dans la décision sont les mêmes, à savoir l'appelante (et le demandeur) et le ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration. Troisièmement, la question est la même, c'est-à-dire l'authenticité du mariage.
[62]
La SAI devait ensuite décider si, malgré que les conditions d'application de la préclusion soient réunies, elle devait exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire conformément à la jurisprudence applicable et entendre l'appel:
Le tribunal examinera la possibilité qu'il y ait un risque d'injustice le cas advenant que la SAI n'entendrait pas l'appel interjeté contre le deuxième refus de la demande de visa de résident permanent du demandeur. Plus précisément, le tribunal déterminera s'il existe en l'espèce de« nouveaux » éléments de preuve conformes au critère qui les régit, démontrant l'existence d'une exception à l'application du principe de la chose jugée.
[63]
Essentiellement, la demanderesse a soutenu devant la SAI qu'il y avait exception au principe de la chose jugée et que la SAI devait exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire en sa faveur puisque de nouveaux éléments de preuve permettaient de conclure à l'authenticité du mariage et que ces éléments n'auraient pu être produits lors de l'instance antérieure même en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable.
[64]
J'estime que la SAI a correctement tranché la question de savoir si les conditions d'application du principe de la chose jugée étaient réunies en l'espèce.
[65]
Les conditions d'application du principe de la chose jugée, telles qu'énoncées par la Cour suprême du Canada, sont les suivantes et exigent:
a. que la même question ait été décidée dans une instance antérieure;
b. que la décision judiciaire invoquée comme créant la préclusion soit finale;
c. les parties dans la décision antérieure invoquée, ou leurs ayants droit, soient les mêmes que les parties engagées dans l'affaire où la préclusion est soulevée.
[66]
En l'espèce, la SAI a conclu que ces conditions étaient toutes réunies. La question à trancher - l'authenticité du mariage de la demanderesse - et les parties à la décision étaient les mêmes que celles de la décision antérieure de la SAI. La SAI est un tribunal compétent qui a le pouvoir de statuer sur les appels en matière de parrainage. En conséquence, la première décision était finale et la SAI a eu raison de conclure que les conditions d'application du principe de la chose jugée étaient réunies.
[67]
La jurisprudence a établi que lorsque les conditions d'application sont réunies, la préclusion découlant d'une question déjà tranchée doit s'appliquer, à moins qu'il n'existe des circonstances spéciales qui justifieraient l'instruction de l'affaire au fond. La Cour suprême du Canada a statué que l'examen des circonstances spéciales exigeait du décideur qu'il se demande si, compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances, l'application de la préclusion découlant d'une question déjà tranchée causerait une injustice (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 64 à 67).
[68]
La présente demande repose essentiellement sur la prétention de la demanderesse voulant que la SAI ait terminé son analyse en concluant que les trois conditions d'application du principe de la chose jugée étaient réunies. La demanderesse prétend que la SAI ne s'est pas demandé si des circonstances spéciales justifiaient d'accueillir l'appel, pas plus qu'elle ne s'est demandé, comme l'exige la common law relativement à l'application du principe de la chose jugée, si elle devait ou non exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire et instruire l'appel, compte tenu de l'injustice qui en découlerait pour la demanderesse. En ne cherchant pas à savoir si l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire était justifié, la SAI a commis une erreur de droit qui, selon la demanderesse, commande l'intervention de la Cour.
[69]
Autrement dit, la SAI a-t-elle conclu de façon raisonnable, dans l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire, que la préclusion découlant d'une affaire déjà tranchée ou le principe de la chose jugée devait s'appliquer dans le cas de la demanderesse?
[70]
La demanderesse soutient que la SAI n'a pas examiné dans leur ensemble les nouveaux éléments de preuve qu'elle avait présentés, mais qu'elle a plutôt soupesé chaque type d'éléments de preuve séparément et a complètement fait abstraction de son plus récent voyage en Inde, qui touchait directement à la question de l'authenticité du mariage et, plus particulièrement, à celle concernant l'absence d'intérêt de la demanderesse pour la famille de son mari.
[71]
À cet égard, je retiens l'argument de la demanderesse selon lequel la SAI a examiné la preuve élément par élément et qu'elle a en effet omis d'aborder le point crucial voulant que la preuve d'un engagement continu qui n'a pas été présentée lors des audiences antérieures, et qui n'aurait pu l'être, peut établir l'intention des parties au moment du mariage.
[72]
La SAI a également conclu que la preuve soumise par la demanderesse ne dissipait pas les doutes exprimés par le premier tribunal au sujet de l'intention des parties au mariage. Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 7 et 8, le juge Douglas Campbell a conclu que la preuve ultérieure d'un engagement pouvait être considérée comme une preuve d'engagement au moment du mariage: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Kaloti
, la Cour d'appel fédérale a énoncé qu'une demande visant le « réexamen de ce qui a déjà été tranché » peut constituer un abus de procédure. Il est implicite dans
Kaloti
et clairement admis dans
Kular
que, dans de telles affaires, les nouvelles demandes doivent comporter de nouveaux éléments de preuve portant sur l'intention du conjoint au moment du mariage.
La demanderesse prétend que la preuve de l'engagement continu constitue un nouvel élément de preuve, puisqu'il n'a pas été question de la nature actuelle de cet engagement à l'audition précédente, et que cet élément de preuve a trait à l'intention des parties au moment du mariage. J'accepte cet argument.
Il n'est pas contesté que, de façon générale, la SAI examine les éléments de preuve concernant la conduite des conjoints après leur mariage (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.F. 1re inst.), et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.F. 1re inst.). De plus, l'article 5.9.1 du
Traitement des demandes à l'étranger
énumère plusieurs facteurs dont l'agent des visas devrait tenir compte pour décider si un mariage donné constitue un mariage de convenance. L'un de ces facteurs est si les conjoints ont vécu ensemble. Selon ces directives, la preuve de l'engagement qui dure dans le temps peut permettre d'établir la bonne foi au moment du mariage. Le tribunal doit décider du poids à accorder à un tel élément de preuve après l'audition de la preuve. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[73]
J'estime que la demanderesse a également raison de faire valoir que l'existence de rapports continus entre les parties peut constituer un nouvel élément de preuve et que la SAI a déjà conclu que cela était suffisant pour refuser d'appliquer le principe de la chose jugée. Dans
Singh
, précité, aux paragraphes 32 à 34, la SAI a conclu que la durée du mariage entre les parties indiquait que leur mariage était authentique. La SAI a déclaré ce qui suit sur ce point:
Le tribunal ne se sent pas obligé d'examiner seulement la nouvelle preuve. Le tribunal n'a pas entendu l'affaire précédente. Il ne peut vérifier quel a été le raisonnement du tribunal à ce moment. Le tribunal a tenu une audience
de novo
et examiné l'ensemble de la preuve, nouvelle et ancienne, et les observations des parties et il a rendu une nouvelle décision.
Le tribunal ne présente pas d'excuses pour sa décision et ne tente pas non plus d'établir une distinction entre son raisonnement et celui du tribunal précédent, qui a parlé pour lui-même, tout comme le présent tribunal le fait, selon la preuve qu'il a examinée.
L'appelant et la demandeure sont mariés depuis avril 2002. Leur mariage a perduré plus de cinq années, en dépit de deux rejets et de deux appels. Tous les facteurs normalement pris en considération par la SAI pour évaluer l'authenticité d'un mariage sont présents et de façon plus ou moins marquée, les facteurs sont favorables. La preuve fait état d'une relation établie sur la base d'un mariage traditionnel arrangé. Les familles respectives ont participé à l'organisation du mariage qui, bien que contracté en peu de temps, ne permet pas d'affirmer qu'ils ont tenté de cacher ce mariage. La preuve examinée aujourd'hui a été jugée crédible et elle a satisfait aux préoccupations soulevées par l'agent des visas.
Lorsqu'elle est examinée dans son ensemble
, la preuve ne permet pas de conclure qu'il s'agit d'un mariage contracté de mauvaise foi. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[74]
Comme la demanderesse le souligne, le mariage qu'elle a contracté avec son époux dure depuis plus longtemps que le mariage d'une durée de cinq ans dont il est question dans
Singh
. La demanderesse et son époux sont mariés depuis 2004 et leur mariage a perduré en dépit du rejet de deux demandes de parrainage et de deux appels devant la SAI. Contrairement à la commissaire Patel, la SAI a, dans
Singh
, examiné l'ensemble de la preuve plutôt que de procéder à une analyse élément par élément de chaque catégorie de preuve.
[75]
Il importe également de mentionner en l'espèce que, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la SAI a tenu compte de nouveaux éléments de preuve, à savoir des visites en Inde, du temps que le couple a passé ensemble, des photographies et des documents tendant à démontrer que le couple communiquait par Internet et par courrier, et elle a conclu que ces nouveaux éléments de preuve la justifiaient de refuser d'appliquer le principe de la chose jugée. De même, dans
Patel
, précité, la SAI a tenu compte des voyages en Inde, du temps passé avec la famille de l'époux en Inde, des photographies et de la preuve de rapports continus, pour conclure que le principe de la chose jugée ne devait pas s'appliquer.
[76]
Je conviens avec le défendeur que chaque affaire doit être tranchée en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres et que la SAI n'est pas liée par ses décisions antérieures. Toutefois, ces décisions laissent voir quel genre de preuve permet d'échapper à l'application du principe de la chose jugée et ce qui est susceptible d'être convaincant. En l'espèce, la demanderesse a présenté des éléments de preuve substantiels visant à démontrer l'engagement dont elle a fait preuve envers son mari au cours des années qui ont suivi le premier appel devant la SAI en 2007. Son mari a déménagé temporairement aux États-Unis pour y travailler de 2007 à 2010. Étant plus près l'un de l'autre, la demanderesse pouvait rendre visite plus souvent à son mari et l'a vu à plusieurs reprises chaque année. La preuve de voyages aux États-Unis, d'un compte bancaire conjoint, de virements d'argent et de cadeaux achetés l'un pour l'autre, de même que des relevés téléphoniques et des photographies ont été présentés à la SAI par le conseil en date du 14 février 2011. En outre, la preuve d'un long voyage effectué par la demanderesse en 2011 a également été présentée à l'appui de son engagement ultérieur envers son mari et a été transmise par télécopieur à la SAI le 5 juillet 2011.
[77]
Il ressort de la décision que la SAI a rejeté la preuve des voyages effectués par la demanderesse pour voir son mari, de même que ses photographies et relevés téléphoniques, parce que le même type de preuve avait été présenté lors du premier appel devant la SAI. Or, la SAI semble avoir été oublié en l'espèce l'opinion exprimée dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, c'est-à-dire que la communication continue et la durée de la relation entre les parties auraient pu changer le résultat du premier appel. Comme le souligne la demanderesse, certains éléments de preuve soumis dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> étaient du même type que ceux soumis lors du premier appel, mais la SAI a quand même accepté les nouveaux éléments de preuve parce qu'ils touchaient à l'authenticité du mariage.
[78]
Je conviens avec la demanderesse qu'une abondante jurisprudence appuie l'idée voulant que la preuve d'un engagement ultérieur puisse établir l'authenticité d'un mariage lorsqu'il a été contracté. La demanderesse et Dhindsa ont présenté des éléments de preuve visant à démontrer que leur mariage est devenu plus solide au cours des sept dernières années et qu'ils sont résolus à maintenir leur relation. Ils ont fourni de nombreux documents à la SAI afin de démontrer leur engagement l'un envers l'autre. Qui plus est, il est une jurisprudence selon laquelle il est possible de tenir compte de nouveaux éléments, même si le même type de preuve a été présenté lors du premier appel.
[79]
Si une relation est authentique et se poursuit dans le temps, il va sans dire qu'un plus grand nombre de photographies, de cartes, de lettres et de relevés téléphoniques sera disponible. Même s'il est possible qu'une preuve du même type ait déjà présentée, ces nouveaux éléments touchent à un aspect du mariage qui n'existait pas auparavant: l'engagement au fil du temps. En outre, en l'espèce, la SAI semble avoir complètement écarté la preuve du plus récent voyage de la demanderesse en Inde. J'accepte la thèse de la demanderesse voulant que la SAI ait commis une erreur dans son appréciation des faits et qu'elle ait ignoré l'existence de nouveaux éléments de preuve déterminants.
[80]
Le défendeur soutient que la SAI avait le pouvoir discrétionnaire de décider si, dans les circonstances de l'espèce, les éléments de preuve soumis par la demanderesse étaient nouveaux et donnaient de ce fait ouverture à l'application de l'exception au principe de la chose jugée. Il fait valoir qu'il était raisonnable pour la SAI de conclure que les éléments de preuve présentés par suite de la durée de la relation ne constituaient pas de nouveaux éléments de preuve déterminants qui permettraient de conclure que les époux avaient vécu ensemble, qu'ils avaient l'intention d'habiter ensemble de façon permanente ou qu'ils entretenaient une relation profonde.
[81]
Je conviens que la SAI possède ce pouvoir discrétionnaire. Je crois cependant que la demanderesse a raison de soutenir que la SAI a omis d'examiner la preuve dans son ensemble, même si cette preuve dissipait les doutes exprimés lors du premier appel devant la SAI. Le conseil de la demanderesse a soumis des éléments de preuve qui répondaient aux principales préoccupations soulevées lors du premier appel, notamment quant à savoir si la demanderesse connaissait la famille de son mari et quant à l'intention des époux au moment du mariage. Comme le souligne la demanderesse, les éléments de preuve qu'elle a soumis visaient les questions importantes suivantes:
La cohabitation aux États-Unis et en Inde
Dhindsa a déménagé pour se rapprocher de la demanderesse
[82]
L'époux de la demanderesse a modifié sa vie de façon significative lorsqu'il a obtenu un visa pour travailler aux États-Unis de 2007 à 2010. Il avait principalement choisi les États-Unis comme lieu de travail pour se rapprocher de son épouse. La demanderesse a soumis de nouveaux éléments de preuve concernant le déménagement de Dhindsa aux États-Unis, notamment son visa américain et la deuxième demande de parrainage. Elle a également fourni de nombreux éléments de preuve documentaire, notamment des cartes d'embarquement, des photographies, des billets d'autobus, des reçus d'hôtel, des reçus d'achats et des itinéraires comme preuve de ses voyages aux États-Unis, et du fait que les époux se sont rencontrés au cours de cette période. L'époux de la demanderesse a également établi un lien avec la fille de celle-ci lorsque la demanderesse est allée le visiter aux États-Unis en juin 2007.
La demanderesse s'est rendue en Inde en 2011
[83]
La demanderesse a passé du temps avec Dhindsa et sa famille lors de son dernier voyage en Inde qui s'est déroulé du 22 avril 2011 au 15 mai 2011. Ce voyage permettait de dissiper les doutes soulevés lors du premier appel quant à savoir si la demanderesse connaissait la famille de son mari.
La communication continue entre les époux
[84]
Tous les relevés téléphoniques que le conseil de la demanderesse a présentés étaient postérieurs à la date du premier refus et témoignaient d'une communication constante entre la demanderesse et son mari.
La connaissance qu'avait la demanderesse de la famille de Dhindsa
[85]
Les photographies soumises par la demanderesse, prises lors des divers voyages qu'ils ont faits pour se rencontrer, montrent qu'elle et Dhindsa sont heureux d'être ensemble. On peut également y voir que la demanderesse a passé du temps avec la famille de Dhindsa en Inde. Ces photographies touchent directement aux préoccupations exprimées par le premier tribunal de la SAI quant à la connaissance que la demanderesse avait de la famille de son mari et à l'intention qu'elle et son mari avaient au moment du mariage.
Le soutien financier continu
Compte conjoint et virements d'argent
[86]
La demanderesse a soumis des éléments de preuve du compte conjoint qu'elle possède avec Dhindsa, de même que des virements d'argent, qui indiquent que celui-ci l'a soutenue financièrement après le premier appel.
Reçus d'achats
[87]
Plusieurs reçus attestant l'achat de certains articles par la demanderesse et son mari lorsqu'ils se sont vus aux États-Unis témoignent du temps qu'ils ont passé ensemble et viennent corroborer la preuve qu'ils se sont visités entre 2007 et 2010.
Conclusion
[88]
Je suis d'accord avec la demanderesse que, considérée dans son ensemble, la preuve soumise répondait directement aux préoccupations initiales de la SAI relativement à l'intention des époux au moment de leur mariage et à la connaissance qu'avait la demanderesse de la famille de son mari. Les époux ont vécu ensemble à plusieurs reprises depuis le premier appel à la SAI, ils ont entretenu une communication soutenue et ont fait preuve d'une certaine dépendance financière l'un envers l'autre.
[89]
Au bout du compte, j'estime que la demanderesse a établi l'existence d'une erreur susceptible de contrôle l'égard de cette question centrale.
[90]
Les avocates s'entendent pour dire qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier et la Cour est du même avis.
JUGEMENT
[91]
LA COUR STATUE que
:
1. La demande est accueillie, la décision est annulée et l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal de la SAI différemment constitué pour nouvel examen.
2. Il n'y a aucune question à certifier.
