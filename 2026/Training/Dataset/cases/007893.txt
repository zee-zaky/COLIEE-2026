Rouleau, J.
: This is an application for an order setting aside the decision of the Minister of National Revenue dated April 14, 1994, whereby he refused to grant the applicant relief from the imposition of interest pursuant to s. 220(3.1) of the
Income Tax Act
, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.
[2]
The applicant is a businessman who, commencing in November of 1985, engaged in trading on the London Metal Exchange through a firm called Van Lessen Richardson & Co. ("VLR"). In his tax returns for the taxation years from 1985 through to 1989, he reported commodity trading gains and losses as follows:
Year
-
Commodity Gains/(Losses)
1985 - ($2,107,309)
1986 - ($216,483)
1987 - ($502,088)
1988 -  $219,085
1989 -  $2,962,212
[3]
In August of 1987, Revenue Canada, Taxation, commenced an audit of the applicant's 1984, 1985 and 1986 taxation years, which included a review of his commodity trading. The audit was eventually expanded to include the 1987, 1988, and 1989 taxation years as well. Mr. Kaiser was advised by the Minister that the audit of his commodity trading was part of an investigation into the London Metal Exchange trading practices of VLR. After reviewing the trading activities of numerous Canadian taxpayers who traded through VLR, Revenue Canada had concluded the vast majority, if not all, of the trades purported to have been transacted by VLR on the London Metal Exchange, never occurred.
[4]
As a result of the audit, interest was assessed against the applicant for his 1986 taxation year and proposed to be assessed for the 1985 and 1987 taxation years as well. By letter dated November 12, 1993, Mr. Kaiser's counsel applied for waiver of the interest under s. 220(3.1) of the
Income Tax Act
. The grounds for relief were stated to be the delays by Revenue Canada; the applicant's lack of knowledge at the relevant times of any wrongdoing by VLR; and, the disparate treatment of the applicant when compared to other taxpayers in similar circumstances. After considering the request, Mr. Paul A. Clemens, Chief of Appeals, Vancouver District Office, Department of National Revenue, decided not to waive the interest and by letter dated April 14, 1994, advised the applicant's counsel as follows:
"I have reviewed your submissions as well as other information that I considered to be relevant to your request, including the guidelines in IC92-2. In particular, I considered your claim that the Department took too long to process the reassessments.
"I regret to inform you that I have determined that it is not appropriate in these circumstances to waive the interest. The delay between the settlement with Audit and the reassessment of the return was no [sic] unreasonably long, given the complexity of the issues."
[5]
The applicant now seeks to have that decision set aside on the grounds the respondent failed to consider all the relevant facts in the exercise of his discretion under s. 220(3.1) of the
Income Tax Act
and acted contrary to law by failing to treat the applicant in the same manner as other taxpayers in similar circumstances.
[6]
Section 161(1) of the
Act
imposes liability upon taxpayers for payment of interest. That provision reads as follows:
"161(1) where at any time after the day on or before which a taxpayer is required to pay the remainder of his tax payable under this Part for a taxation year,
(a) the amount of his tax payable for the year under this Part exceeds
(b) the aggregate of all amounts each of which is an amount paid at or before that time on account of his tax payable and applied as at that time by the Minister against the taxpayer's liability for an amount payable under this Part for the year,
the person liable to pay the tax shall pay to the Receiver General interest at the prescribed rate on the excess computed for the period during which that excess is outstanding."
[7]
Section 220(3.1) permits the Minister to waive or cancel any portion of interest otherwise payable. It provides:
"220(3.1) The Minister may at any time waive or cancel all or any portion of any penalty or interest otherwise payable under this Act by a taxpayer or partnership and, notwithstanding subsection 152(4) to (5), such assessment of the interest and penalties payable by the taxpayer or partnership shall be made as is necessary to take into account the cancellation of the penalty or interest."
[8]
The purpose of this legislative provision is to allow Revenue Canada, Taxation, to administer the tax system more fairly, by allowing for the application of common sense in dealing with taxpayers who, because of personal misfortune or circumstances beyond their control, are unable to meet deadlines or comply with rules under the tax system. The language used in the section bestows a wide discretion on the Minister to waive or cancel interest at any time. To assist in the exercise of that discretion, policy guidelines have been formulated and are set out in Information Circular 92-2.
[9]
The jurisprudence has established the standard to be employed by the courts when called upon to review the exercise of a discretionary power such as the one in question here. In
Re Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. and Government of Canada et al.
, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2; 44 N.R. 354; 137 D.L.R.(3d) 558 (S.C.C.), McIntyre, J., stated at p. 562:
"In construing statutes such as those under consideration in this appeal, which provide for far-reaching and frequently complicated administrative schemes, the judicial approach should be to endeavour within the scope of the legislation to give effect to its provisions so that the administrative agencies created may function effectively, as the legislation intended. In my view, in dealing with legislation of this nature, the courts should, wherever possible, avoid a narrow, technical construction, and endeavour to make effective the legislative intent as applied to the administrative scheme involved.
It is, as well, a clearlyestablished rule that courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility. Where the statutory discretion has been exercised in good faith and, where required, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, the courts should not interfere.
" (emphasis added)
[10]
I am unable to conclude, based on the facts before me, that the Minister improperly exercised his discretion in the present case. The applicant was afforded the opportunity to make representations as to why the interest should be waived and the Minister had before him, by reason of the prolonged history of the matter, all the relevant facts necessary on which to base a reasoned and objective decision. It is clear from the affidavit evidence of Paul Clemens that a number of factors played a role in his decision to refuse the applicant's request. Absent bad faith on the part of the Minister, a breach of the principles of natural justice or consideration of extraneous or irrelevant factors, there is nothing to warrant the court's interference with the exercise of his discretion. I am unable to conclude any of these exist in the present case.
[11]
The applicant takes exception to the fact that other taxpayers who engaged in commodity trading on the London Metal Exchange through VLR were not assessed for interest in the same manner he was. However, that does not constitute a basis for overturning the impugned decision. Every case is required to be decided on its own merit in order that circumstances unique to that individual taxpayer are properly taken into account. The fact the respondent exercised its discretion in a different manner for different taxpayers is not an indication of bad faith. It is simply reflective of the fact that when the Minister exercises his discretion under s. 220(3.1), he is required to take into account considerations relevant and unique to that taxpayer alone. Indeed, were he to fail to exercise his discretionary power in that manner and simply apply the same rule to all taxpayers regardless of their individual circumstances, he would be fettering the discretion bestowed upon him by the legislation.
[12]
For the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
