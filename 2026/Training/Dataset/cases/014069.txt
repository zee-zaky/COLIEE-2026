Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
: The principal Applicant, her common-law spouse and his son seek refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
]. The principal Applicant fears persecution by paramilitaries in Colombia; her spouse and his son fear persecution arising from criminality in Mexico. They seek judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board, which denied the claim of the principal Applicant on the basis of state protection and the claim of her spouse and his son as they lacked a section 96 of the
IRPA
nexus and was based on generalized risk in Mexico.
III.
Judicial Review
[2]
This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
IRPA
for judicial review of the RPD's decision, dated January 11, 2012.
IV.
Background
[3]
The principal Applicant, Ms. Maria Ilda Avila Rodriguez, a citizen of Colombia, was born in 1960. Her spouse, Mr. Jose Aniceto Elias Cotlame Tepole, and his son, Jose Omar Eduardo Cotlame Zepahua, are citizens of Mexico, born in 1965 and 1991, respectively.
[4]
The principal Applicant's brother and his business partner owned a restaurant in a town in Colombia and paid extortion fees to Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] guerillas.
[5]
In 1999, the principal Applicant claims paramilitaries attacked the town, destroying the restaurant. She alleges she and her family began to receive threatening telephone calls from paramilitaries accusing them of collaboration with FARC. She claims her brother complained to the judicial crown attorney and the Red Cross. They advised "that it was very difficult to do anything because nothing had happened to them yet" and "told him to take private security measures" (Principal Applicant's Personal Information Form [PIF] at para 14).
[6]
The principal Applicant fled to the United States [U.S.] on April 26, 1999. She travelled to Colombia on October 2, 1999 and returned to the U.S. on May 16, 2000.
[7]
The principal Applicant claims she remained in the U.S. waiting for her mother, sister, and son to obtain U.S. visas. She states that her family planned to seek protection in Canada, she worked in the US to support them, and she consulted a lawyer about U.S. asylum who advised her that her claim would be late and she would likely be deported.
[8]
The principal Applicant's brother was accepted as a refugee in Canada in 2001.
[9]
The principal Applicant alleges that the paramilitaries murdered three siblings of the business partner in 2001 and left a message saying: "this is what happens to accomplices of [FARC] guerillas" (Decision at para 9); two children of the murdered siblings disappeared in 2003. In 2008, paramilitaries looking for her and her brother threatened her mother and buyers of the family home. In 2009, paramilitaries killed the business partner's uncle for denouncing corruption; they also threatened her father and cousin's daughter while looking for her brother and the business partner.
[10]
The principal Applicant's spouse travelled to the U.S. in 2001, returning to Mexico in 2005. In Mexico, he was mugged three times. He and his son then travelled to the U.S. on September 17, 2006.
[11]
The principal Applicant and her spouse began a common-law relationship on March 3, 2008. They entered Canada with his son on September 30, 2009.
V.
Decision under Review
[12]
The RPD denied the principal Applicant's claim on three grounds: (i) she did not claim asylum in the U.S.; (ii) she re-availed to Colombia; and, (iii) she did not rebut the presumption of state protection. The claim of her spouse and his son failed because there was no nexus to a Convention ground and their risk was general.
[13]
The RPD found that the principal Applicant lacked subjective fear of persecution because she did not claim asylum in the U.S. despite living there nine years. Refugees, it reasoned, "seek protection as soon as practical once out of the reach of the hands of their oppressors" (Decision at para 16). The RPD rejected her claim that she did not seek asylum because "it was too late" when she decided to file. If her fear was genuine, it held, she would have attempted to remedy her status.
[14]
The RPD considered the principal Applicant's return to Colombia inconsistent with subjective fear of persecution citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA). The RPD rejected the principal Applicant's claim that she returned to help her family relocate and protect itself as there was insufficient credible evidence to persuade the RPD that her family could not relocate without her.
[15]
The RPD found the principal Applicant did not provide clear, convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the RPD reasoned that evidence of inadequate state protection must be reliable, probative, and show, on a balance of probabilities that state protection is inadequate. The RPD also cited
Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), which held that the presumption is not rebutted simply because a state's efforts is not always successful if it has effective control of its territory, has military, police, and civil authority, and makes serious efforts to protect citizens.
[16]
The RPD, citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  it inferred that failing to do so is (absent a compelling explanation) often fatal if a state is a functioning democracy, willing and having means to protect citizens. The RPD referred to
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , for the principle that this burden is "proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to him or her"(para 5).
[17]
The RPD was not persuaded that police would not investigate, arrest, and prosecute the paramilitaries if the principal Applicant had reported them and there had been sufficient evidence. The RPD did not accept that the disappearance of the children in 2003, after their mother sought protection, showed police would not help; nor did the RPD accept that police assisted paramilitaries in finding victims. The principal Applicant did not provide credible evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the police were not acting on reports by her family.
[18]
The RPD expressed scepticism as to whether the paramilitaries would be interested in the principal Applicant even though (i) her PIF narrative mostly addressed her brother's experience with the paramilitaries and (ii) years had passed since the paramilitaries targeted her brother. Nonetheless, the RDP accepted that the paramilitaries called the principal Applicant's house in Bogota after attacking her brother's restaurant, that the paramilitaries were looking for the principal Applicant in 2008 at her former home, and that the paramilitaries were still asking about her and her brother because they believed he and she were FARC militants and because he and she did not cooperate with the paramilitaries.
[19]
The RPD held that Colombia's serious efforts to address crime and corruption outweighed evidence of human rights abuses by paramilitaries. Acknowledging the inconsistencies among the sources, the RPD found that the objective evidence demonstrated that there was adequate, albeit imperfect, state protection in Colombia for victims of crime. In support, the RPD listed Colombian institutions created to combat extortion and kidnapping. The RPD held that documentary evidence established that these efforts have been effective.
[20]
The RPD found that the principal Applicant's spouse and his son had no nexus to a Convention ground. Citing jurisprudence by this Court, the PRD held that fear of criminality did not provide a nexus.
[21]
The RPD found that their risk was too generalized to make them persons in need of protection under section 97 of the
IRPA
. The RPD highlighted the principal Applicant's spouse's testimony "that everybody is at risk of harm"and that "everybody is at risk" of mugging and robbing in Mexico and testimony by his son that "members of the drug cartel[s] grab any person" (Decision at para 49-50). Noting that the evidence shows many Mexicans are at risk of criminal violence, the RPD concluded that they faced "a generalized risk of robbery, drug activity and violence, which every person in Mexico faces" (at para 51).
VI.
Issues
[22]
(1) Was the RPD's finding that the principal Applicant had adequate and effective state protection in Colombia reasonable?
(2) Was the RPD's finding that the principal Applicant lacked subjective fear as she had not applied for refugee protection in the U.S. and had re-availed to Colombia reasonable?
(3) Was the RPD's finding that the principal Applicant's spouse and his son faced a generalized risk in Mexico reasonable?
VII.

VIII.
Position of the Parties
[24]
The principal Applicant submits that the RPD was unreasonable in finding that she lacked subjective fear because she did not claim asylum in the U.S. and returned to Colombia. The principal Applicant concedes that the RPD may draw a negative inference from failure to claim refugee protection in a first safe country but contends this is not decisive. The principal Applicant refers to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  which required the RPD to "assess why there was delay in the application and why asylum was not sought at the first occasion" (para 13). The principal Applicant claims that both her concern for her family and her inability to trust anyone else to relocate them justify re-availment. The principal Applicant cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), which held that a refugee regime does not exclude "brave or simply stupid persons in favour of those who are more timid or more intelligent" (para 5).
[25]
According to the principal Applicant, the finding that she had not rebutted the presumption of state protection was unreasonable. The principal Applicant argues that democratic government does not necessarily establish adequate state protection.
[26]
The principal Applicant argues that the RPD made its state protection finding in a capricious and perverse manner. The principal Applicant claims that the RPD failed to discuss specific evidence showing Colombia cannot protect personally targeted individuals. The principal Applicant highlights a report by Dr. Marc Chernick, Visiting Associate Professor at Georgetown University's Centre for Latin American Studies, stating that Colombia, despite aggressive policies, cannot protect targeted individuals and a letter from Amnesty International to similar effect [Chernick report].
[27]
While the principal Applicant concedes that the RPD need not refer to every piece of evidence, she submits that the circumstances obliged the RPD to discuss this particular evidence. The principal Applicant argues that the RPD failed to explain how it weighed evidence and why state initiatives against paramilitaries and guerillas establish state protection. The principal Applicant cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  which holds that "the more significant a piece of evidence is, the more likely it is that a failure to make reference to it will result in a finding that the Decision was unreasonable, especially when it appears to be a marked contradiction to a finding of the RPD" (para 66).
[28]
The principal Applicant claims that the state protection analysis does not only ask if a state has a legislative and procedural framework to address abuses. Decision-makers must also assess the capacity and will to effectively implement that framework.
[29]
The principal Applicant adds, citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that refugee claimants "need not risk their lives in seeking [state] protection merely to demonstrate its ineffectiveness" (para 16).
[30]
In respect of the claim of her spouse and his son, the principal Applicant submits that the RPD did not conduct an individualized inquiry for two reasons. First, the RPD did not address whether his risk was personalized due to the time that he spent abroad from Mexico. Second, the RPD did not address whether the foreign nationality of his spouse, the principal Applicant, would personalize his risk.
[31]
The principal Applicant also argues the RPD's interpretation of subsection 97(1) of the
IRPA
errs in law by focusing on the reasons of persecution. The principal Applicant relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  which did not accept that a claimant specifically and repeatedly targeted by criminals had general risk. The principal Applicant submits that generalized risk only exists in extreme situations like disasters affecting all inhabitants of a country.
[32]
The Respondent submits that a central aspect of the RPD's state protection finding was that the principal Applicant had not established that she had been directly or personally targeted by the paramilitaries. On this basis, according to the Respondent, the RPD concluded that state protection for the principal Applicant would be adequate.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Respondent argues that the RDP may reasonably distinguish direct and indirect targets of violence in making a state protection finding. In this context, a direct target would be a person who has been personally targeted by a violent group (in this case, the principal Applicant's brother) and a person who has been indirectly targeted because they have some relationship to a direct target.
[33]
The Respondent argues that the RPD was not obliged to expressly address the documentary evidence adduced by the principal Applicant, in particular, the Chernick report. The Respondent argues that the Chernick report addresses the risks of individuals who were directly targeted by the paramilitaries. Since the RPD considered the principal Applicant to be only an indirect target of the paramilitaries, the Chernick report did not bear on her personal circumstances and the RDP was not obliged to analyze it. The Respondent cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the proposition that the RPD's obligation to discuss particular evidence is proportionate to how directly related that evidence is to the personal situation of an applicant.
[34]
The Respondent contends that the RPD's analysis of the principal Applicant's delay in claiming refugee protection and her re-availment was reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Respondent argues that re-availment, in the absence of compelling circumstances, "typically suggests an absence of risk or a lack of subjective fear of persecution" (at para 7). It was also reasonable to find that the nine years the principal Applicant spent in the U.S. also detracted from her subjective fear. The Respondent cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the propositions that (i) delay in filing a refugee protection claim "can be fatal to an applicant's claim" absent a satisfactory explanation and (ii) the mere fact that the applicants had one relative in Canada is insufficient to overcome failure to apply earlier in another country (at paras 53-4).
[35]
The Respondent submits that the risk of the principal Applicant's spouse and his son is generalized and outside the scope of paragraph 97(1)(b) of the
IRPA
. The Respondent argues that they did not show that they had been targeted or faced prospective risk beyond that of Mexicans generally. The Respondent refers to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the principle that "[w]here a portion, not necessarily a majority, of the population is subjected to threats of extortion and violence, the evidence must demonstrate that the Applicants have experienced something that is beyond what has been experienced by the population that is otherwise subjected to such threats" (para 8).
[36]
In response to submissions that the risk in the present case is higher due to the fact that the principal Applicant's spouse and his son had been out of Mexico for a long time and that his wife is foreign, the Respondent submits that their testimony indicated that the basis of their fear was generalized risk.
IX.
Analysis
[37]
Whether the principal Applicant has adequate state protection in Colombia is a question of fact reviewable on a reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . This standard also applies to the RPD's findings on subjective fear (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) and generalized risk (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[38]
Under this standard, this Court may only intervene if the RPD's reasons are not justified, transparent or intelligible. To be reasonable, decisions must be in the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47).
(1)
Was the RPD's finding that the principal Applicant had adequate and effective state protection in Colombia reasonable
?
[39]
To rebut the presumption of state protection, applicants must bring clear, convincing, reliable, and probative evidence that demonstrates, on a balance of probabilities, that Colombia cannot provide adequate state protection ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 30).
[40]
A reasonable state protection assessment distinguishes willingness to protect from ability to protect.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  has held that evidence of improvement and progress does not necessarily equate with effective protection and that"changes [must] have been effectively implemented in practice" (para 64 and 66).
[41]
The principal Applicant submitted clear and convincing reports from reliable sources that appear to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that Colombia cannot protect those who have been targeted by paramilitaries. A Canadian Council for Refugees [CCR] report states that paramilitaries can"track people down" throughout Colombia, that "citizens forced to return to their country are likely to be immediately noticed by the Colombian information system and civil society", and that there are "no reliable protection programs"for "ordinary citizens" (Tribunal Record [TR] at pp 600 and 611). A report by Dr. Chernick, describes the re-armament of paramilitaries and states unequivocally that, despite government policy, Colombia cannot protect "individuals threatened with kidnapping, extortion or extra-judicial assassination" (TR, para 8 at p 551). Amnesty International [AI] claims that while "authorities are still attempting to paint a positive picture", successor groups to paramilitaries can "pursue victims throughout [Colombia and] may do so where the individual is of particular interest" and are "close[ly] coordinat[ed with] police and security forces" (TR at pp 574, 580 and 576). AI notes that the "vast majority of human rights abuses are characterized by complete impugnity" (TR at p 581).
[42]
A Human Rights Watch report that was not included in the Tribunal Record but was part of the National Documentation Package [NDP] considered by the RPD also concludes that Colombia protects certain vulnerable groups but not "former [paramilitary] victims seeking to assert their rights. Nor does it provide protection or assistance to the many ordinary Colombians who are now being threatened or attacked by the successor groups" (Human Rights Watch: Paramilitaries' Heirs: The New Face of Violence in Colombia (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2010 at p 107). A Response to Information Request, COL103286.E, dated 23 February 2010, in the NDP also gives evidence of inadequate state protection against paramilitaries. Only one expert consulted in COL103286.E said protection was adequate; according to a subsequent interview with the CCR, he admitted he was"not a reliable source [on internal conflict, a point he made] clear to the IRB" (TR at p 613).
[43]
It was not reasonable to find that Colombia's anti-criminality efforts outweigh evidence of human rights violations by paramilitaries. The RPD claims it weighed country conditions evidence in finding that adequate and effective state protection exists:
[32] ... The Board recognizes that there are some inconsistencies among several sources within the documentary evidence; however, the preponderance of the objective evidence regarding current country conditions suggests that, although not perfect, there is an adequate state protection in Colombia for victims of crime, that Colombia is making serious efforts to address the problem of criminality, and that the police are both willing and able to protect victims. The evidence also suggests that the state's efforts addressing the problem of criminality have been effective.
[44]
The preponderance of evidence in the record and the NDP suggests otherwise; that Colombia cannot effectively protect those who are targets of paramilitaries.
[45]
Some evidence shows that paramilitaries involved in kidnapping and extortion have been arrested, that kidnappings and extortion has decreased, and that there has been success in demobilizing paramilitaries. A lukewarm report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] states that government efforts against paramilitaries "have achieved positive results" but adds that Colombia"need[s] to redouble preventative mechanisms for population at risk" (TR at p 529).
[46]
Evidence of improvement cited by the RPD does not fully embrace the particular situation of the principal Applicant. Evidence of demobilization and decreased extortion and kidnapping rates demonstrates success in curbing paramilitaries but does not specifically ask if persons who have been targeted by paramilitaries have effective protection. The materials noted in paragraphs 41 and 42 above, however, address this very issue; they strongly suggest Colombia cannot protect paramilitary targets.
[47]
In the present case, the RPD's state protection finding is unreasonable as it did not weigh the documentary evidence with consideration to the principal Applicant's particular situation. Although there is some inconsistency in the evidence as to the success of the Colombian government in demobilizing the paramilitaries, the evidence was consistent on the question that the RPD should have been asking in weighing the evidence: "Can Colombia protect a person who has been targeted by paramilitaries?"
[48]
Instead, the RPD infers state protection for the principal Applicant from evidence of efforts to curb the paramilitaries generally. This strategy recalls
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where this Court found that the RPD was unreasonable in weighing the evidence by"search[ing] desperately for any sign of operational adequacy in a generally bleak situation and call[ing] this 'real progress' and 'some success' and 'serious action'" (para 74).
[49]
The record indicates that the principal Applicant's family sought state protection. The RPD did not dispute the credibility of the principal Applicant's statement that her brother complained to the judicial crown attorney.
[50]
The Respondent takes the position that the RPD made a reasonable finding that the principal Applicant had adequate and effective state protection as a person who was not a direct target of the paramilitaries:
[4] The central aspect of the Board's state protection finding was that, since the Applicant had not established that she had been personally targeted by the paramilitaries, state protection would be adequate for her, as it was for her mother, son and sister. While the issue would be very different for someone who have been personally targeted, the Board's finding was based in the specific facts before it, and was not unreasonable. (Respondent's Further Memorandum of Argument on Judicial Review)
[51]
With respect, this interpretation asks the Court to take a Procrustean approach to the RPD's reasons - stretching what the RPD actually said to fit the jurisprudence as stated  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In this case, the approach advanced by the Respondent would stretch the RDP's reasons to the point of distortion.
[52]
Closer review of the RDP's decision shows that the RPD queried whether the principal Applicant had been targeted directly by the paramilitaries
but ultimately determined
that she had been personally targeted by the paramilitaries and that Colombia could offer her state protection in these circumstances:
[29] . . . When asked why any paramilitary group would be interested in her when she mainly writes in her PIF narrative about the problems her brother had in Colombia, Maria indicated that she is her brother's family member and if she had not fled Colombia, she may have had problems. Maria went on to say that the paramilitary groups may not have been demobilized in Colombia. When asked why any paramilitary group would be interested in her today, many years after the incidents of 1999, Maria stated that the paramilitaries do not forget; they have lists of people that they look for; and they feel that she and her family members are militants of the guerillas.
Maria explained that the paramilitaries do not forget; they have lists of people that they look for; and they feel that she and her family members are militants of the guerillas. Maria explained that the paramilitaries are still asking about her and her brother because she and her brother did not obey them or deal with them and the paramilitaries want more space on a political level
[Emphasis added]. Maria testified that she does not believe police would help her if she were to return to Bogota, Colombia and had problems with the paramilitaries because Julio's mother sought the help of police for years and his family members have disappeared. Maria went on to indicate that she thinks police make it easier for paramilitaries to find their victims.
[30] I find that Maria has failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. I am not persuaded that police would not investigate all of Maria's allegations if she was to report them. I am also not persuaded that police would not arrest and prosecute all of
Maria's assailants
[Emphasis added] if there was sufficient evidence. (Decision, above)
[53]
The foregoing demonstrates that the RPD found that (i) the paramilitary groups were the principal Applicant's "assailants" and, (ii) notwithstanding this, that the principal Applicant had effective and adequate protection.
[54]
The Respondent's argument relies on a misinterpretation of the RPD's reasons. The RPD's finding that Colombia could provide adequate and effective state protection to the principal Applicant even though she had been personally targeted by the paramilitaries is inconsistent with the interpretation advanced by the Respondent - that state protection was available because the principal Applicant was not an indirect target.
[55]
The Respondent asks this Court to take the latter interpretation because the RPD asked why the principal Applicant believed the paramilitaries were interested in her when her PIF mostly discussed her brother's problems. The RPD, however, did not dispute the principal Applicant's evidence of personal targeting and ultimately determined that she had adequate and effective state protection even though she had been personally targeted. Consequently, the reasons of the RPD cannot support this inference and the Respondent's argument on this ground fails.
[56]
The undersigned member of this Court recognizes that "[r]easons may not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that does not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result under a reasonableness analysis" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 16). In this case, however, not only did the RPD fail to make a finding on the Respondent's argument - it also came to a finding that is essentially inconsistent with the notion that the principal Applicant was not a direct target.
(2)
Was the RPD's finding that the principal Applicant lacked subjective fear as she had not applied for refugee protection in the U.S. and had re-availed to Colombia reasonable
?
[57]
Delay in claiming refugee protection is not itself a "decisive factor" but is something decision-makers may "take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (FCA) at para 4). A decision-maker must "consider the explanations offered by the respondent for the delay in filing a refugee claim" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[58]
Decision-makers may consider re-availment in assessing fear of persecution but must consider an explanation that a claimant who re-availed offers (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[59]
The RPD rejected the principal Applicant's claim that she did not seek asylum in the U.S. as it was too late to apply by the time she decided to claim. The RPD reasoned that if she "was genuinely fearful of returning to Colombia, she would have made an attempt to normalize her status" (at para 18). In respect of her claim that she returned to Colombia to relocate her family, the RPD found that "[i]nsufficient credible evidence was presented to indicate that Maria's family members could not have been relocated in Colombia without Maria returning" (Decision at para 21).
[60]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis), the Federal Court of Appeal stated that "it is almost always foolhardy for a Board in a refugee case, where there is no general issue as to credibility, to make the assertion that the claimants had no subjective element in their fear". This Court has arrived at a similar conclusion in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[61]
While failure to claim asylum in the U.S., despite living there for nine years, is troubling, the RPD did not dispute the principal Applicant's general credibility. Consequently, this Court presumes the principal Applicant's testimony was credible ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26).
[62]
Given that the RPD did not make a general negative credibility finding, its decision that the principal Applicant lacked subjective fear is not reasonable. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Yves de Montigny described the cognitive dissonance arising if decision-makers accept testimony as to persecution but simultaneously find an applicant lacks subjective fear:
[27] If the Board member wanted to impugn the credibility of the applicants, he had to say so explicitly and to provide an explanation. In the absence of such a finding, it is difficult to understand why the Board member came to the conclusion that the applicants' fears were not subjectively well founded. If he accepts that the female applicant has been twice sexually assaulted, how could she not have a subjective fear to return to the location of her aggressors, in a country where the authorities are unwilling and/or incapable to protect her? ...
[63]
The RPD did not dispute the principal Applicant's credibility as to whether paramilitaries had attacked and continued to threaten her family; thus, it is "difficult to understand" how it found she lacked subjective fear ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 27).
(3)
Was the RPD's finding that the principal Applicant's spouse and his son faced a generalized risk in Mexico reasonable
?

, the principal Applicant's spouse and his son must show, on a balance of probabilities, that their removal to Mexico would subject them personally, in every part of Mexico, to a risk to their lives or cruel and unusual treatment that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from Mexico.
[65]
The RPD was reasonable in finding that the principal Applicant's spouse and his son faced a generalized risk in Mexico. At the hearing, the principal Applicant's spouse and his son alleged a fear of criminality in Mexico that both conceded was felt by everyone in the country (TR at pp 806 and 815).
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aff'd 2009 FCA 31, has held that risk of criminal violence in a country where criminal violence is highly prevalent is general rather than personal, even if a claimant is a member of a sub-group that is more vulnerable to victimization (para 23).
[66]
It is not unreasonable to consider Mexicans who have lived abroad or who have non-Mexican spouses to be sub-groups described in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. The RPD did not expressly conclude that the principal Applicant's spouse and his son were part of a sub-group. Deference, however, requires the Court to pay "'respectful attention to the reasons offered
or which could have been offered
in support of a decision'" [emphasis in original] (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aff'ing the dissenting reasons of Justice John Maxwell Evans, 2010 FCA 56 at para 164, citing Professor Dyzenhaus, "The Politics of Deference: Judicial Review and Democracy", in M Taggart, ed, The Province of Administrative Law (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 1997) 279 at p 286).
[67]
The circumstances of the principal Applicant's spouse and his son are distinguishable from those in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, where the claimant's risk was greater than that of the general populace because he was subject to individual and ongoing targeting by a criminal gang. The evidence does not demonstrate that the principal Applicant's spouse and his son are subject to individual and ongoing threat of criminal violence in Mexico.
X.
Conclusion
[68]
For all of the above reasons, the principal Applicant's application for judicial review is granted and the matter is returned for a hearing anew (
de novo
) before a differently constituted panel of the tribunal; the principal Applicant's spouse and his son's application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[69]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
1. The principal Applicant's application for judicial review be granted and the matter be returned for a hearing anew (
de novo
) before a differently constituted panel of the tribunal.
2. The principal Applicant's spouse and his son's application for judicial review be dismissed.
3. No question for certification.

[Traduction]: La demanderesse principale, son conjoint de fait et le fils de celui-ci demandent l'asile en vertu des articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR]. La demanderesse principale craint d'être persécutée par les forces paramilitaires en Colombie; son conjoint de fait et le fils de celui-ci craignent d'être persécutés en raison de la criminalité qui sévit au Mexique. Tous trois sollicitent le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés [la SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a rejeté la demande d'asile de la demanderesse principale au motif que cette dernière pouvait bénéficier de la protection de l'État, ainsi que la demande d'asile du conjoint de fait de la demanderesse et du fils de celui-ci au motif qu'elle n'était fondée sur aucun des motifs prévus à l'article 96 de la LIPR et qu'elle reposait sur l'existence d'un risque généralisé au Mexique.
III.
Contrôle judiciaire
[2]
La Cour est saisie d'une demande présentée en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la LIPR sollicitant le contrôle judiciaire de la décision de la SPR, datée du 11 janvier 2012.
IV.
Contexte
[3]
Née en 1960, la demanderesse principale, Mme Maria Ilda Avila Rodriguez, est citoyenne de la Colombie. Son conjoint, M. Jose Aniceto Elias Cotlame Tepole, et le fils de celui-ci, Jose Omar Eduardo Cotlame Zepahua, nés en 1965 et en 1991, respectivement, sont citoyens du Mexique.
[4]
Le frère de la demanderesse principale et son associé en affaires étaient propriétaires d'un restaurant en Colombie et versaient de l'argent à des guérilleros des Forces armées révolutionnaires de Colombie [les FARC] qui les extorquaient.
[5]
La demanderesse principale prétend qu'en 1999, les forces paramilitaires ont attaqué la ville et détruit le restaurant. Elle allègue que sa famille et elle ont commencé à recevoir des appels de menaces de la part des forces paramilitaires qui les accusaient de collaborer avec les FARC. Elle affirme que son frère s'est plaint au procureur du ministère public et à la Croix-Rouge. Ceux-ci l'ont informé [traduction] « qu'il était très difficile de faire quoi que ce soit parce que rien ne leur était encore arrivé » et [traduction] « ils lui ont dit de prendre des mesures de sécurité privées » (Formulaire de renseignements personnels [FRP] de la demanderesse principale, par 14).
[6]
La demanderesse principale s'est enfuie aux États-Unis le 26 avril 1999. Elle est retournée en Colombie le 2 octobre 1999 et est revenue aux États-Unis le 16 mai 2000.
[7]
La demanderesse principale allègue qu'elle est demeurée aux États-Unis en attendant que sa mère, sa sœur et son fils obtiennent des visas américains. Elle déclare que les membres de sa famille avaient l'intention de demander l'asile au Canada, qu'elle avait travaillé aux États-Unis pour subvenir à leurs besoins et qu'elle s'était renseignée sur la possibilité de demander l'asile aux États-Unis auprès d'un avocat, qui lui aurait dit qu'il était trop tard et qu'elle serait vraisemblablement expulsée.
[8]
Le frère de la demanderesse principale a obtenu le statut de réfugié au Canada en 2001.
[9]
La demanderesse principale allègue qu'en 2001, les forces paramilitaires ont tué trois des frères et sœurs de l'associé de son frère et qu'elles ont laissé un message indiquant que « c'est ce qui arrive aux complices des guérilléros [des FARC] » (paragraphe 9 de la décision); deux enfants des frères et sœurs assassinés ont disparu en 2003. En 2008, les forces paramilitaires, qui recherchaient alors la demanderesse principale et son frère, ont menacé leur mère et les acheteurs de la maison familiale. En 2009, les forces paramilitaires ont tué l'oncle de l'associé parce qu'il avait dénoncé la corruption. Elles ont également menacé le père de la demanderesse principale et la fille du cousin de celle-ci, alors qu'elles recherchaient le frère de la demanderesse principale et son associé.
[10]
Le conjoint de la demanderesse principale s'est rendu aux États-Unis en 2001 et est revenu au Mexique en 2005. Là-bas, il s'est fait agresser à trois reprises. Son fils et lui se sont rendus aux États-Unis le 17 septembre 2006.
[11]
La demanderesse principale et son conjoint ont commencé à faire vie commune le 3 mars 2008. Ils sont entrés au Canada, avec le fils du conjoint, le 30 septembre 2009.
V.
Décision contrôlée
[12]
La SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile de la demanderesse principale pour trois motifs: (i) elle n'a pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis; (ii) elle s'est réclamée de nouveau de la protection de la Colombie; (iii) elle n'a pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État. La demande d'asile de son conjoint et du fils de celui-ci a été rejetée parce qu'aucun lien avec l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention n'avait été établi et que le risque auquel ceux-ci étaient exposés était un risque général.
[13]
La SPR a conclu que l'omission de la demanderesse principale de demander l'asile aux États-Unis, malgré les neuf années où elle y est demeurée, témoignait d'une absence de crainte subjective de persécution. Elle a précisé que les réfugiés« sont censés demander la protection dès qu'il est possible de le faire et qu'ils se trouvent hors de portée de leurs oppresseurs » (Décision, par 16). La SPR a rejeté l'allégation de la demanderesse principale selon laquelle elle n'a pas demandé l'asile parce qu'au moment de présenter sa demande, « il était trop tard ». La SPR a conclu que si sa crainte avait été réelle, elle aurait tenté de régulariser son statut.
[14]
La SPR a estimé que le retour de la demanderesse principale en Colombie était incompatible avec une crainte subjective d'être persécutée, s'appuyant à cet égard sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF). La SPR a rejeté l'allégation de la demanderesse principale selon laquelle elle était retournée pour aider sa famille à se réinstaller et à se protéger au motif qu'il n'y avait pas d'éléments de preuve crédibles suffisants pour convaincre la SPR que la famille de la demanderesse principale ne pouvait pas se réinstaller sans elle.
[15]
La SPR a conclu que la demanderesse principale n'a pas fourni de preuve claire et convaincante pour réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État. S'appuyant sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la SPR a conclu que la preuve de l'insuffisance de la protection de l'État doit être digne de foi et probante, et montrer, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la protection de l'État est insuffisante. La SPR a également cité l'arrêt
Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), dans lequel la Cour d'appel a statué que la présomption n'est pas réfutée simplement parce que les efforts d'un État ne connaissent pas toujours du succès, plus particulièrement si l'État a le contrôle efficient de son territoire, qu'il possède des autorités militaires et civiles et une force policière et qu'il fait de sérieux efforts pour protéger ses citoyens.
[16]
Après avoir cité l'arrêt
Canada (Procureur général) c Ward
, [1993] 2 RCS 689, la SPR a conclu que les demandeurs d'asile doivent s'adresser à l'État pour obtenir sa protection dans les cas où la protection de l'État aurait pu raisonnablement être assurée. Renvoyant à
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  elle a précisé qu'en l'absence d'une explication convaincante, le fait de ne pas solliciter la protection de l'État est souvent fatale si, dans l'État en question, le fonctionnement de la démocratie n'est pas remis en question et si cet État est disposé à assurer un certain degré de protection à ses citoyens et possède les ressources nécessaires pour le faire. La SPR a renvoyé à
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par 5, pour énoncer le principe que ce fardeau est« proportionnel au degré de démocratie atteint chez l'État en cause: plus les institutions de l'État seront démocratiques, plus le revendicateur devra avoir cherché à épuiser les recours qui s'offrent à lui ».
[17]
La SPR n'était pas convaincue que la police n'aurait pas enquêté sur les actions des paramilitaires si la demanderesse principale les avait signalées, ni qu'elle n'aurait pas arrêté et poursuivi les agresseurs si la preuve avait été suffisante. La SPR n'a pas reconnu que la disparition des enfants en 2003, après que leur mère eut tenté d'obtenir de la protection, démontrait que la demanderesse ne pouvait compter sur l'aide de la police. Elle n'a pas non plus reconnu que la police aidait les forces paramilitaires à rechercher leurs victimes. La demanderesse principale n'a pas fourni suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles pour démontrer que la police ne donnait pas suite aux signalements faits par sa famille.
[18]
La SPR a paru douter de la possibilité que les forces paramilitaires s'intéressent à la demanderesse principale alors que (i) l'exposé circonstancié du FPR de la demanderesse portait surtout sur l'expérience de son frère avec les forces paramilitaires; (ii) plusieurs années s'étaient écoulées depuis que les forces paramilitaires avaient ciblé son frère. La SPR a néanmoins reconnu que les forces paramilitaires s'étaient rendues à la maison de la demanderesse principale à Bogotá après avoir attaqué le restaurant de son frère, qu'elles recherchaient la demanderesse principale en 2008 à son ancienne résidence et qu'elles se renseignaient encore à son sujet et au sujet de son frère parce qu'elles croyaient qu'ils soutenaient tous deux activement les FARC et refusaient de collaboraient avec elles.
[19]
La SPR a conclu que la Colombie faisait des efforts importants pour lutter contre la criminalité et la corruption et que ces efforts l'emportaient sur la preuve des violations des droits de la personne commises par les forces paramilitaires. Reconnaissant les incohérences entre les sources constituant la preuve documentaire, elle a conclu que la preuve objective démontrait qu'en Colombie, la protection offerte par l'État aux victimes d'actes criminels était adéquate, bien qu'imparfaite. Pour appuyer sa conclusion, la SPR a nommé quelques organismes colombiens de lutte contre l'extorsion et les enlèvements. Elle a conclu que la preuve documentaire établissait que ces efforts s'étaient révélés efficaces.
[20]
La SPR a conclu que la demande du conjoint de la demanderesse principale et du fils de celui-ci n'avait aucun lien avec l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention. Après avoir cité quelques décisions de la Cour, elle a conclu que la crainte des actes criminels ne permettait pas d'établir un tel lien.
[21]
La SPR a conclu que le risque auquel le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et du fils de celui-ci étaient exposés était trop général pour qu'ils soient considérés comme des personnes à protéger en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR. Elle s'est arrêtée au témoignage du conjoint de la demanderesse principale qui a affirmé que « tout le monde risque de subir un préjudice » et que, s'agissant des agressions et des vols au Mexique, « tout le monde est exposé à ce risque », de même qu'elle a cité le témoignage du fils du conjoint, selon qui « les membres des cartels de la drogue s'en prennent à n'importe qui » (aux paragraphes 49 et 50 de la décision). Faisant remarquer que la preuve indiquait que plusieurs Mexicains étaient exposés à un risque de violence criminelle, la SPR a conclu que le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci étaient exposés « au risque généralisé d'être victimes de vol, d'activités liées aux stupéfiants et de violence, un risque auquel tout le monde est exposé au Mexique » (par 51).
VI.
Les questions en litige
[22]
(1) La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la demanderesse principale avait accès à une protection de l'État adéquate et efficace en Colombie était-elle raisonnable?
(2) La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la crainte de demanderesse principale n'avait pas de fondement subjectif parce qu'elle n'avait pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis et s'était réclamée à nouveau de la protection de l'État en Colombie était-elle raisonnable?
(3) La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci étaient exposés à un risque généralisé au Mexique était-elle raisonnable?
VII.

VIII.
Position des parties
[24]
La demanderesse principale soutient qu'il était déraisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que sa crainte n'avait pas de fondement subjectif parce qu'elle n'avait pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis et qu'elle était retournée en Colombie. Elle reconnaît que la SPR pouvait tirer une conclusion défavorable de son omission de demander l'asile dans le premier pays sûr où elle est arrivée, mais elle fait valoir que ce fait ne saurait être déterminant. La demanderesse principale renvoie à la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  selon laquelle la SPR doit « évaluer la raison pour laquelle il y a eu un retard à présenter une demande d'asile et la raison pour laquelle l'asile n'a pas été demandé à la première occasion » (par 13). La demanderesse principale prétend c'est à cause de son inquiétude au sujet des membres de sa famille, ainsi que de son incapacité à faire confiance à quiconque pour les réinstaller qu'elle s'est réclamée de nouveau de la protection de la Colombie. Elle cite l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), dans lequel la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué que le régime de protection des réfugiés n'excluait pas « les personnes courageuses ou simplement stupides au profit de celles qui sont plus timides ou plus intelligentes ».
[25]
Selon la demanderesse principale, la conclusion suivant laquelle elle n'avait pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État était déraisonnable. Elle soutient qu'un gouvernement démocratique n'offre pas nécessairement une protection de l'État adéquate.
[26]
La demanderesse principale fait valoir que la conclusion de SPR au sujet de la protection de l'État a été tirée de façon arbitraire et abusive. Elle allègue que la SPR n'a pas examiné certains éléments de preuve tendant à démontrer que la Colombie ne peut protéger les citoyens qui sont personnellement ciblés. La demanderesse principale fait état d'un rapport rédigé par M. Marc Chernick, professeur agrégé invité au centre des études latino-américaines de l'université de Georgetown, qui indique que la Colombie, malgré des politiques énergiques, ne peut pas protéger les personnes ciblées [le rapport Chernick], ainsi que d'une lettre d'Amnistie internationale qui va dans le même sens.
[27]
La demanderesse principale reconnaît que la SPR n'est pas obligée de mentionner chaque élément de preuve, mais elle estime que, dans les circonstances, la SPR devait analyser ces éléments de preuve. Elle soutient que la SPR n'a pas expliqué comment elle avait apprécié la preuve ni pourquoi les initiatives de l'État pour lutter contre les forces paramilitaires et les guérilleros établissent que l'État protège ses citoyens. La demanderesse principale cite la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans laquelle la Cour déclare que « plus un élément de preuve est important, plus il est probable que l'on conclura du fait que le tribunal n'en a pas fait mention que sa décision est déraisonnable, en particulier lorsqu'il y a une contradiction marquée avec l'une de ses conclusions » (par 66).
[28]
La demanderesse principale allègue que dans l'analyse relative à la protection de l'État, le décideur ne doit pas seulement se demander si l'État dispose d'un cadre législatif et procédural qui lui permet de lutter contre les abus. Le décideur doit également vérifier si l'État a la capacité et la volonté d'en mettre les dispositions en œuvre.
[29]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par 16, la demanderesse principale ajoute que le demandeur d'asile « ne doit pas mettre sa vie en danger en sollicitant la protection [de l'État] simplement pour démontrer son inefficacité ».
[30]
En ce qui a trait à la demande d'asile de son conjoint et du fils de celui-ci, la demanderesse principale soutient que la SPR n'a pas procédé à un examen individualisé pour deux raisons. Premièrement, la SPR ne s'est pas demandé si le risque auquel son conjoint était exposé était personnalisé, et ce, à cause du temps que celui-ci a passé à l'étranger. Deuxièmement, la SPR ne s'est pas demandé si la nationalité étrangère de la demanderesse principale, sa conjointe, avait pour effet de personnaliser le risque.
[31]
La demanderesse principale fait également valoir que la SPR a commis une erreur de droit dans son interprétation du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR en se concentrant sur les motifs liés à la persécution. Elle s'appuie sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans laquelle la Cour n'a pas retenu l'argument voulant qu'un demandeur expressément et fréquemment pris pour cible était exposé à un risque généralisé. Selon elle, le risque généralisé n'existe que dans les cas extrêmes, p. ex. lorsqu'une catastrophe touche tous les habitants d'un pays.
[32]
Selon le défendeur, l'un des principaux éléments de la conclusion de la SPR quant à la protection de l'État est que la demanderesse principale n'a pas établi que les forces paramilitaires la ciblaient directement ou personnellement. Il affirme que la SPR a de ce fait conclu que la demanderesse principale bénéficierait d'une protection de l'État adéquate. Il s'appuie sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pour faire valoir qu'il est raisonnable pour la SPR d'établir une distinction entre les victimes de violence directement et indirectement prises pour cibles lorsqu'elle tire une conclusion relative à la protection de l'État. Ainsi, la cible directe serait la personne visée personnellement par un groupe violent (en l'espèce, le frère de la demanderesse principale) et la cible indirecte serait visée en raison de la relation qu'elle pourrait avoir avec la cible directe.
[33]
Le défendeur soutient que la SPR n'était pas tenue de mentionner expressément les éléments de preuve documentaire présentés par la demanderesse principale, et plus particulièrement, le rapport Chernick. Le défendeur fait valoir que le rapport Chernick aborde la question des risques auxquels sont exposées les personnes directement ciblées par les forces paramilitaires. Puisque la SPR a estimé que la demanderesse principale n'était qu'une cible indirecte des forces paramilitaires, le rapport Chernick ne concernait pas sa situation personnelle et la SPR n'était pas tenue de l'analyser. Le défendeur cite la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  à l'appui de la proposition suivant laquelle l'obligation de la SPR d'analyser un élément de preuve en particulier est proportionnelle à la mesure dans laquelle cet élément est directement lié à la situation personnelle du demandeur.
[34]
Le défendeur soutient que l'analyse de la SPR relative au retard de la demanderesse principale à demander l'asile et au fait de s'être réclamée de nouveau de la protection de l'État en Colombie était raisonnable. Citant la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  il fait valoir qu'en l'absence de circonstances impérieuses, le fait de solliciter à nouveau la protection de l'État« tend habituellement à indiquer une absence de risque ou une absence de crainte subjective de persécution » (au paragraphe 7). Il était aussi raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que les neuf années que la demanderesse principale a passées aux États-Unis discréditaient sa crainte subjective. Il cite également la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pour affirmer que (i) lorsqu'une personne n'est pas en mesure d'expliquer sa lenteur à présenter une demande d'asile, « celle-ci peut être déclarée irrecevable », et que (ii) le simple fait que les demandeurs aient un parent installé au Canada ne permet pas de passer sur le fait qu'ils n'ont pas demandé l'asile plutôt dans un autre pays (par 53 et 54).
[35]
Le défendeur fait valoir que le risque auquel le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci sont exposés est un risque généralisé qui échappe à l'application de l'alinéa 97(1)
b
) de la LIPR. Le défendeur soutient que ces derniers n'ont pas démontré qu'ils avaient été ciblés ou qu'ils étaient exposés à un risque prospectif plus grand que celui auquel les Mexicains sont exposés en général. Le défendeur renvoie à la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pour illustrer le principe selon lequel « [l] orsqu'une partie de la population - et non pas nécessairement la majorité - est victime de menaces d'extorsion et de violence, la preuve doit démontrer que les demandeurs ont été victimes de gestes plus graves que les menaces auxquelles la population en général est par ailleurs exposée » (par 8).
[36]
En réponse à l'argument voulant que le risque en l'espèce soit plus élevé parce que le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci ont quitté le Mexique depuis longtemps et que la demanderesse principale est une étrangère, le défendeur prétend qu'il ressort des témoignages que ceux-ci ont offert que leur crainte est fondée sur un risque généralisé.
IX.
Analyse
[37]
La question de savoir si la demanderesse principale peut se prévaloir d'une protection de l'État adéquate en Colombie est une question de fait susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Cette norme s'applique également aux conclusions de la SPR au sujet de la crainte subjective (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) et du risque généralisé (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[38]
Suivant cette norme, la Cour peut uniquement intervenir si les motifs de la SPR ne sont pas justifiés, transparents ou intelligibles. Pour qu'une décision soit raisonnable, elle doit appartenir « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
(1)
La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la demanderesse principale avait accès à une protection de l'État adéquate et efficace en Colombie était-elle raisonnable?
[39]
Pour réfuter la présomption de la protection de l'État, le demandeur d'asile doit, par une preuve claire, convaincante, digne de foi et probante, démontrer, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la Colombie ne peut assurer une protection adéquate ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, par 30).
[40]
Le décideur qui procède à une évaluation raisonnable de la protection de l'État établit une distinction entre la volonté d'assurer une protection et la capacité de le faire. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour a statué que la preuve de l'amélioration de la situation et des progrès réalisés par l'État ne veut pas nécessairement dire qu'il existe une protection efficace et que « les changements [devaient avoir été] mis en œuvre de façon efficace dans la pratique » (par 64 et 66).
[41]
La demanderesse principale a présenté des rapports clairs et convaincants provenant de sources dignes de foi, lesquels semblent démontrer, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la Colombie ne peut protéger les personnes ciblées par les forces paramilitaires. Selon un rapport du Conseil canadien pour les réfugiés [CCR], les forces paramilitaires sont capables de [traduction] « retracer quelqu'un » partout en Colombie, les [traduction] « citoyens forcés d'y retourner risquent d'être immédiatement repérés par le système d'information et la société civile du pays », et il n'existe [traduction] « aucun programme de protection fiable » destiné [traduction] « aux citoyens ordinaires » (dossier du tribunal [DT], p 600 et 611). Dans son rapport, M. Chernick traite du réarmement des forces paramilitaires et affirme sans équivoque que, malgré ses politiques gouvernementales, la Colombie ne peut protéger les [traduction] « personnes menacées d'enlèvement, d'extorsion ou d'assassinat extrajudiciaire » (DT, par 8 à la p 551). Amnistie Internationale [AI] affirme quant à elle que, même si [traduction] « les autorités tentent toujours de décrire la situation de façon favorable », les groupes qui succèdent aux forces paramilitaires peuvent [traduction] « poursuivent leurs victimes partout [en Colombie], surtout s'ils sont particulièrement intéressés par la personne », et que ces groupes sont [traduction] « étroitement liés à la police et aux forces de sécurité » (DT, p 574, 580 et 576). AI souligne que [traduction] « de façon générale, la grande majorité des violations des droits de la personne sont commises en toute impunité » (DT, p 580).
[42]
Suivant un rapport de Human Rights Watch non versé au dossier du tribunal, mais faisant partie du Cartable national de documentation [CND] examiné par la SPR, la Colombie protège certains groupes vulnérables, mais non [traduction] « les anciennes victimes [des forces paramilitaires] cherchant à faire valoir leurs droits. La Colombie n'offre pas non plus de protection ou d'assistance aux nombreux Colombiens ordinaires qui sont maintenant menacés ou attaqués par les groupes qui ont remplacé les forces paramilitaires » (Human Rights Watch,
Paramilitaries' Heirs: The New Face of Violence in Colombia
, New York, Human Rights Watch, 2010, p 107). Une Réponse à la demande d'information, COL103286.EF, datée du 23 février 2010 et contenue au CDN, témoigne de l'insuffisance de la protection de l'État contre les forces paramilitaires. Un seul des experts cités dans le document COL103286.EF a indiqué que cette protection était suffisante. À l'occasion d'une entrevue ultérieure avec le CCR, cet expert a reconnu qu'il n'était pas [traduction] « une source digne de foi [au sujet du conflit interne, un point qu'il a fait valoir] de façon claire à la CISR » (DT, p 613).
[43]
Il n'était pas raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que les efforts de la Colombie pour lutter contre la criminalité l'emportaient sur la preuve des violations des droits de la personne commises par les forces paramilitaires. La SPR soutient qu'elle a apprécié la preuve sur la situation du pays avant de conclure à l'existence d'une protection de l'État adéquate et efficace:
[32] [...] La Commission reconnaît que la preuve documentaire, constituée à partir de différentes sources, comporte certaines incohérences; toutefois, la prépondérance des éléments de preuve objectifs qui traitent des conditions actuelles en Colombie donne à penser que la protection offerte par l'État aux victimes d'actes criminels y est adéquate, même si elle n'est pas parfaite, que la Colombie s'efforce sérieusement d'enrayer les problèmes de criminalité et que les policiers sont prêts à aider les victimes et capables de le faire. En outre, il ressort de la preuve que les efforts faits par l'État pour s'attaquer aux problèmes de criminalité se sont avérés efficaces.
[44]
La preuve prépondérante versée au dossier et le CND tendent à indiquer le contraire: la Colombie ne peut pas protéger de façon efficace les personnes ciblées par les forces paramilitaires.
[45]
Certains éléments de preuve indiquent que des paramilitaires ayant participé à des enlèvements et à des activités d'extorsion ont été arrêtés, que le nombre de cas d'enlèvement et d'extorsion a diminué et que la démobilisation des forces paramilitaires a progressé. Dans un rapport mitigé du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés [UNHCR], il appert que [traduction] « les efforts du gouvernement pour lutter contre les forces paramilitaires se sont soldés par des résultats positifs », mais que la Colombie [traduction] « doit multiplier les mécanismes de prévention pour la population à risque » (DT, p 529).
[46]
La preuve relative à l'amélioration de la situation citée par la SPR ne vise pas vraiment la situation particulière dans laquelle se trouve la demanderesse principale. Les documents faisant état de la démobilisation et de la diminution des cas d'extorsion et d'enlèvement démontrent que l'État a réussi à freiner les forces paramilitaires, mais ils ne portent pas expressément sur la question de savoir si les personnes ciblées par les forces paramilitaires bénéficient d'une protection efficace. Cependant, les documents mentionnés aux paragraphes 41 et 42 ci-dessus portent précisément sur cette question et ils donnent fortement à penser que la Colombie ne peut protéger les personnes ciblées par les forces paramilitaires.
[47]
En l'espèce, la conclusion tirée par la SPR relativement à la protection de l'État est déraisonnable parce que la SPR n'a pas apprécié la preuve documentaire en fonction de la situation particulière de la demanderesse principale. Certes, la preuve relative au succès des efforts entrepris par le gouvernement colombien pour démobiliser les forces paramilitaires comportait certaines incohérences, mais la preuve portant sur la question qu'aurait dû poser la SPR dans son analyse: « La Colombie peut-elle protéger une personne qui a été ciblée par les forces paramilitaires? » était quant à elle cohérente.
[48]
La SPR a plutôt inféré de la preuve relative aux efforts entrepris pour freiner les forces paramilitaires en général que la demanderesse principale pouvait se prévaloir de la protection de l'État. Cette façon de faire rappelle la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans laquelle la Cour a conclu que la SPR avait apprécié les éléments de preuve de façon déraisonnable en « cherch[ant] désespérément le moindre signe de caractère satisfaisant des efforts concrets dans le contexte d'une situation très sombre et [en] appel[ant] cela 'de réels progrès', 'des progrès' et 'des mesures rigoureuses' » (par 74).
[49]
Le dossier indique que la famille de la demanderesse principale a sollicité la protection de l'État. La SPR n'a pas mis en doute la crédibilité de la déclaration de la demanderesse principale selon laquelle son frère s'est plaint au procureur du ministère public.
[50]
Selon le défendeur, la SPR a raisonnablement conclu que la demanderesse principale avait accès à une protection de l'État adéquate et efficace, étant donné qu'elle n'était pas directement ciblée par les forces paramilitaires:
[traduction] [4] L'élément principal de la conclusion de la Commission relativement à la protection de l'État était que, puisque la demanderesse n'avait pas établi que les forces paramilitaires la ciblaient personnellement, elle pourrait bénéficier d'une protection de l'État suffisante, à l'instar de sa mère, de son fils et de sa sœur. Bien que la question soit très différente dans le cas d'une personne ciblée personnellement, la conclusion de la Commission était fondée sur les faits précis dont elle disposait et n'était pas déraisonnable. (Mémoire des arguments supplémentaires du défendeur dans le cadre du contrôle judiciaire)
[51]
En toute déférence, cette interprétation invite la Cour à adopter une approche digne de Procuste à l'égard des motifs de la SPR, car elle force le sens de ce que la SPR a réellement dit pour que les motifs qu'elle a exposés soient conformes à la position adoptée par la Cour dans
Castro Nino
, précité. En l'espèce, l'approche préconisée par le défendeur forcerait le sens des motifs de la SPR au point de les dénaturer.
[52]
Il ressort d'un examen attentif de la décision que la SPR celle-ci s'est demandé si les forces paramilitaires avaient directement ciblé la demanderesse principale,
mais qu'elle a finalement conclu
que celle-ci avait été ciblée personnellement et que la Colombie pouvait lui offrir sa protection dans les circonstances:
[29] [...] Questionnée à savoir pourquoi un groupe paramilitaire s'intéresserait à elle alors que dans l'exposé circonstancié contenu dans son FRP, il est surtout question des problèmes que son frère a connus en Colombie, XXX a indiqué qu'elle fait partie de la famille de son frère et que, si elle n'avait pas fui la Colombie, elle aurait pu avoir des problèmes. XXX a ajouté que les groupes paramilitaires n'ont pas été démobilisés en Colombie. Tenue d'expliquer pourquoi un groupe paramilitaire s'intéresserait à elle aujourd'hui, nombre d'années après les incidents de 1999,
XXX a répondu que les forces paramilitaires n'oublient pas: elles ont des listes des personnes qu'elles recherchent et elles croient que les membres de sa famille et elle soutiennent activement les guérilléros. XXX a expliqué que des membres des forces paramilitaires s'informent encore à son sujet et au sujet de son frère parce que son frère et elle ne leur ont pas obéi et ont refusé de traiter avec eux et que les forces paramilitaires veulent une plus grande place sur la scène politique
. XXX a affirmé qu'elle ne croit pas que la police l'aiderait si elle retournait à XXX et que les forces paramilitaires lui causaient des ennuis, parce que la mère de XXX a demandé l'aide de la police pendant des années et que des membres de leur famille ont disparu. XXX a ajouté qu'elle croit que la police facilite la tâche des forces paramilitaires quand elles recherchent leurs victimes
[30] J'estime que XXX n'a pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État au moyen d'éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants. Je ne suis pas convaincue que la police n'enquêterait pas sur l'ensemble des allégations de XXX si cette dernière lui signalait les incidents. Je ne suis pas non plus convaincue que la police n'arrêterait pas les
agresseurs de XXX
et ne les poursuivrait pas si la preuve était suffisante. (Décision de la SPR précitée.) [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[53]
Le passage qui précède démontre que la SPR a conclu que (i) les groupes paramilitaires étaient les « agresseurs » de la demanderesse principale, et que, (ii) malgré cela, la demanderesse principale pouvait se prévaloir d'une protection de l'État efficace et adéquate.
[54]
L'argument du défendeur repose sur une interprétation erronée des motifs de la SPR. La conclusion de la SPR suivant laquelle la Colombie pouvait offrir une protection adéquate et efficace à la demanderesse principale, malgré le fait que les forces paramilitaires l'avaient personnellement ciblée, est incompatible avec l'interprétation avancée par le défendeur selon laquelle la demanderesse pouvait se prévaloir de la protection de l'État parce qu'elle n'était pas une cible indirecte.
[55]
Le défendeur demande à la Cour d'adopter cette dernière interprétation parce que la SPR s'est demandé pourquoi la demanderesse principale croyait que les forces paramilitaires s'intéresseraient à elle alors qu'il était surtout question dans son FRP des problèmes de son frère. Or, la SPR n'a pas mis en doute les éléments de preuve de la demanderesse principale selon lesquels elle était personnellement ciblée et elle a conclu en définitive que la demanderesse principale pouvait se prévaloir d'une protection de l'État adéquate et efficace même si elle avait été ciblée personnellement. Par conséquent, les motifs de la SPR ne sauraient étayer cette conclusion et l'argument du défendeur fondé sur ce motif est rejeté.
[56]
Je reconnais qu'« [i]l se peut que les motifs ne fassent pas référence à tous les arguments, dispositions législatives, précédents ou autres détails que le juge siégeant en révision aurait voulu y lire, mais cela ne met pas en doute leur validité ni celle du résultat au terme de l'analyse du caractère raisonnable de la décision » (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En l'espèce, toutefois, la SPR a non seulement omis de tirer une conclusion répondant à l'argument du défendeur, mais elle est arrivée à une conclusion qui est essentiellement incompatible avec l'idée que la demanderesse principale n'était pas directement ciblée.
(2)
La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la crainte de la demanderesse principale n'avait pas de fondement subjectif parce qu'elle n'avait pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis et s'était réclamée à nouveau de la protection de l'État en Colombie était-elle raisonnable?
[57]
Le retard à présenter une demande d'asile n'est pas en soi un « facteur déterminant », mais il s'agit d'un élément dont le décideur « peut tenir compte pour apprécier les dires ainsi que les faits et gestes d'un revendicateur » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (CAF), par 4). Le décideur « doit tenir compte des explications données par le défendeur du retard du dépôt d'une demande d'asile » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par 57).
[58]
Dans son analyse de la crainte de persécution, le décideur peut tenir compte du fait que le demandeur d'asile s'est réclamé à nouveau de la protection de l'État, mais il doit tenir compte de l'explication donnée par le demandeur d'asile à cet égard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par 21).
[59]
La SPR a rejeté la prétention de la demanderesse principale voulant qu'elle n'ait pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis parce qu'il était trop tard lorsqu'elle s'est décidée à présenter sa demande. Selon la SPR, si la demanderesse principale « avait vraiment craint de retourner en Colombie, elle aurait tenté de régulariser son titre » (par 18). Quant à sa prétention selon laquelle elle était retournée en Colombie pour réinstaller sa famille, la SPR a conclu qu'« [i] l n'a pas été établi au moyen d'éléments de preuve crédibles suffisants que les membres de la famille de [Maria] n'auraient pas pu se réinstaller en Colombie sans que [Maria] n'y retourne » (Décision, par 21).
[60]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis), la Cour d'appel fédérale a déclaré qu'« il est presque toujours téméraire pour une Commission, dans une affaire de réfugié où aucune question générale de crédibilité ne se pose, d'affirmer qu'il n'existe aucun élément subjectif de crainte de la part du demandeur ». Notre Cour a tiré une conclusion semblable dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[61]
Il est certes troublant que la demanderesse principale n'ait pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis, bien qu'elle y ait vécu pendant neuf ans, mais la SPR n'a pas mis en doute sa crédibilité générale. Par conséquent, la Cour présume que le témoignage de la demanderesse principale était crédible ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, par 26).
[62]
Étant donné que la SPR n'a pas tiré de conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité générale de la demanderesse principale, il n'est pas raisonnable qu'elle ait conclu que sa crainte n'avait pas de fondement subjectif. Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, le juge Yves de Montigny a décrit le problème cognitif qui se pose lorsqu'un décideur accepte le témoignage d'un demandeur au sujet de la persécution à laquelle celui-ci est exposé tout en concluant que sa crainte n'a pas de fondement subjectif:
[27] Si le commissaire voulait mettre en doute la crédibilité des demandeurs, il devait le dire explicitement et s'en expliquer. En l'absence d'une telle conclusion, il est difficile de comprendre pourquoi il a fini par conclure que les craintes des demandeurs n'avaient pas de fondement subjectif. S'il admet que la demanderesse a été deux fois victime d'une agression sexuelle, comment ne pouvait-elle pas avoir une crainte subjective de retourner vers l'endroit où vivent ses agresseurs, dans un pays où les autorités ne veulent pas et/ou ne peuvent pas la protéger? [...]
[63]
La SPR n'a pas mis en doute la crédibilité de la demanderesse principale quant à savoir si les forces paramilitaires avaient attaqué sa famille et continué de la menacer. Il est donc « difficile de comprendre » comment la SPR a pu conclure que la crainte de la demanderesse principale n'avait pas de fondement subjectif ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, par 27).
(3)
La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci étaient exposés à un risque généralisé au Mexique était-elle raisonnable?
[64]
Pour être considérés comme des personnes à protéger au sens de l'article 97 de la LIPR, le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci doivent démontrer, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que par leur renvoi vers le Mexique ils seraient personnellement exposés en tout lieu de ce pays à une menace à leur vie ou au risque de traitements cruels et inusités alors que d'autres personnes originaires du Mexique ou s'y trouvant ne le sont généralement pas.
[65]
La SPR a conclu de façon raisonnable que le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci étaient exposés à un risque généralisé au Mexique. À l'audience, le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci ont affirmé craindre la criminalité au Mexique, mais ils ont tous les deux reconnu que cette crainte était ressentie par l'ensemble de la population (DT, p 806 et 815). Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  confirmée par 2009 CAF 31, la Cour a statué que le risque associé à la violence criminelle dans un pays où celle-ci est très présente est un risque général plutôt qu'un risque personnel, même si le demandeur appartient à un sous-groupe susceptible de devenir victime (par 23).
[66]
Il n'est pas déraisonnable de considérer les Mexicains qui ont vécu à l'étranger ou qui ont un conjoint non Mexicain comme étant l'un des sous-groupes décrits dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. La SPR n'a pas expressément conclu que le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci appartenaient à un sous-groupe. La déférence exige toutefois que la Cour fasse preuve d'une « [traduction] 'attention respectueuse aux motifs donnés
ou qui pourraient être donnés
à l'appui d'une décision' » [souligné dans l'original] (
Alliance de la fonction publique du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , confirmant les motifs dissidents du juge John Maxwell Evans, 2010 CAF 56, par 164, citant le professeur Dyzenhaus,« The Politics of Deference: Judicial Review and Democracy », dans M Taggart, dir,
The Province of Administrative Law
, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 1997, 279, p 286).
[67]
La situation du conjoint de la demanderesse principale et du fils de celui-ci se distingue de celle décrite dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité. Dans cette affaire, le risque auquel le demandeur était exposé était plus important que celui auquel l'était la population en général parce qu'il était personnellement et constamment ciblé par un gang criminel. La preuve ne démontre pas que le conjoint de la demanderesse principale et le fils de celui-ci sont exposés à des menaces individuelles et continues de violence criminelle au Mexique.
