INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [Act] for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [RPD or the Board], dated November 23, 2012 [Decision], which refused the Applicants' application to be deemed Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicants are citizens of Hungary and are of Roma ethnicity. They claim to have faced persecution and discrimination due to their ethnicity, and to have a well-founded fear of further persecution if they are returned to Hungary. They arrived in Canada on May 19, 2011 and made claims for refugee protection on May 21, 2011.
[3]
The claims were based on a single narrative set out by Dezsone Rusznyak [Ms. Rusznyak] in her personal information form  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  on behalf of herself, her husband Dezso [Mr. Rusznyak] and their now four-year-old daughter Brigitta. In that narrative, the Applicants claimed to fear physical attacks by racist and right-wing groups in Hungary, which attacks and threats had, in their view, increased over the previous few years. They claimed to have been segregated in school and denied access to education after grade 8, and they say that they and their family members have been physically attacked on several occasions by skinheads or "Hungarian Guards." They claimed that Mr. Rusznyak and his father were attacked while fishing at a local lake in 2002, that the two adult Applicants were attacked by three men while walking together in a park in the spring of 2008, both receiving knife wounds, and that Mr. Rusznyak was confronted and thrown into a lake while fishing in the Summer of 2010. Ms. Rusznyak says four Hungarian Guards attacked her and her sister in 2008, knocking out two of her teeth and breaking her sister's rib. She claimed that her sister was attacked by skinheads in 2000, her brother was attacked in 2001, she and her parents were chased out of a shop by skinheads in 2003, her sister's husband and son were beaten up in the village of Martonyi in August 2007 while she was out with them for a "village day," and her parents were attacked by Guardists in the Spring of 2009 as they went to the store. The Applicants described reporting some of these incidents to police, but say they were denied help or received notice a short time later that the files had been closed due to a lack of evidence, or because the perpetrators were unknown.
[4]
The Applicants also say they faced discrimination on an everyday basis, and described being denied access to a bus, swimming pools and a local pub by people who called them "dirty rotten gypsies" or other names.
[5]
The Applicants' claims were heard together by the RPD on November 2, 2012, with Mr. Rusznyak acting as his daughter's designated representative, and all three were rejected in the Decision dated November 23, 2012. Ms. Rusznyak was the main witness at the hearing, with her husband also giving brief evidence.
[6]
Ms. Rusznyak attests that two of her sisters and their families came to Canada around the same time and successfully claimed refugee status based on essentially the same facts. One of these families had their claims heard and approved on the same day by the same Board member who made the Decision at issue here.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[7]
The RPD identified the determinative issues as credibility and state protection.
[8]
On the issue of credibility, the Board found Ms. Rusznyak to be an untrustworthy witness, and therefore concluded that it did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the Applicants were Convention refugees. In the alternative, the Board found that the Applicants had access to adequate state protection in Hungary.
[9]
The Board found serious contradictions and material inconsistencies between Ms. Rusznyak's PIF and her testimony at the hearing for which she did not provide a reasonable explanation when given the opportunity. The PIF narrative stated that the attack in the park occurred in the Spring of 2008, while Ms. Rusznyak stated in her testimony that it occurred in the Spring of 2009, while she was pregnant. The Board rejected Ms. Rusznyak's explanation that she made a mistake in the PIF, finding that she associated the event with her first pregnancy and was therefore not likely to make a mistake about its timing. The Board also found a discrepancy regarding whether the Applicants sought medical attention following this attack. The PIF stated that they received care from a doctor's assistant, while Ms. Rusznyak testified that they did not seek medical attention. The RPD did not accept the explanation that they got mixed up while writing the narrative because they had suffered many injuries. The Board also found inconsistencies in the evidence regarding who reported this incident to the police and the police response, and observed that when questioned on the discrepancies Ms. Rusznyak "could not keep her story straight." Based on these inconsistencies, the RPD was "not persuaded that the [claimants] were attacked in a park by three racists."
[10]
The Board also noted discrepancies in the Applicants' evidence regarding their complaint to the mayor of their village about being refused service at a local pub / café and the mayor's response. The PIF stated that the mayor refused to deal with it, while Ms. Rusznyak testified that the Mayor said he would speak with the pub owner but she did not know whether he actually intervened. She also made allegations in her testimony that the mayor was a racist and a member of racist groups, which was not stated in the PIF and which the RPD found to be an embellishment of the claim. In addition, Mr. Rusznyak's testimony differed from the PIF regarding what year he was confronted and thrown into a lake while fishing; when asked about the discrepancy he testified that he did not know exactly when it happened.
[11]
The Board also noted that the Applicants claimed to have made reports to the police on numerous occasions but had provided no police reports. When asked, Ms. Rusznyak testified that she asked her sister in Hungary to obtain the reports, but her sister was told that Ms. Rusznyak would have to appear in person to get them. She testified that she had not asked her parents-in-law to obtain any of the reports, despite the fact that, according to her testimony, they had been involved in making some of the reports to the police. The RPD found that "the female claimant has failed to provide, contrary to her onus to do so, relevant documentation to establish her claim," and observed that "she could have at least asked her in-laws to request a report from the police." The Board noted that "Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division stipulates that the claimant 'must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim,' and that if a claimant does not provide such documents 'he/she must be able to explain the reason they were not provided or at least relay what steps were taken to obtain them'." As such, the Board found that the Applicants had failed to establish that they were beaten and injured in an attack in 2009 or refused service in a pub because of their ethnicity.
[12]
The Board then went on to make a broader credibility finding based on the perceived contradictions and inconsistencies noted above, stating (Decision at para 19):
[19] When I consider the evidence as a whole, the evidence raises serious issues related to the credibility of the claimants. The sworn testimony of a claimant is presumed to be truthful, unless there is valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. The female claimant and the claimant in this case have failed to advance their claims with evidence that is consistent or credible. I am aware that none of the credibility concerns raised here may be sufficient, each on its own, to negate this claim. However, the cumulative effect of all of them is that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the female claimant and claimant are Convention refugees. As the Court of Appeal in [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA)], MacGuigan, J.A. held:
... even without disbelieving every word [a claimant] has uttered, a ... panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes that there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim ... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from his testimony.
The female claimant and that claimant are, therefore, not Convention refugees.
[13]
The RPD went on to state that: "In the alternative, I find that the claimants have adequate state protection as this issue was raised at the beginning of the hearing."
[14]
The RPD noted that the Applicants bore the burden of rebutting the presumption of state protection with "clear and convincing" evidence of the state's inability to protect its citizens, and of showing that they had taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to seek protection.
[15]
The Board acknowledged that the documentary evidence showed that "the attitude of some Hungarian people, including some in positions of authority, toward the Roma is discriminatory and prejudicial," that "Roma are discriminated against in almost all fields of life," and that "the situation for Roma individuals in Hungary has not improved, but rather worsened" and "previously hidden anti-Roma attitudes are becoming more open." With respect to the police, the Board observed that "human rights problems during [2012] included police use of excessive force against suspects, particularly Roma," and that "Roma victims of crime very often face discriminatory treatment by the police; police officers are reluctant to register reports made by Roma and especially the racial motivation of a crime reported." Based on this evidence, the Board stated (Decision at paras 31):
I acknowledge and have considered that there is evidence to indicate that there is widespread reporting of incidents of intolerance, discrimination and persecution of Romani individuals in Hungary ...
[16]
And further (Decision at para 42):
A fair reading of the documentary evidence indicates that the central government is motivated and willing to implement measures to protect the Roma, but these measures are not always implemented effectively at the local or municipal level. The documentary evidence relating to government efforts to protect the Roma and to legislate against broader forms of discrimination and persecution is mixed.
[17]
Nonetheless, the Board found (Decision at para 43) as follows:
[T]he objective evidence regarding current country conditions suggests that, although not perfect, there is adequate state protection in Hungary for Roma who are victims of crime, police abuse, discrimination or persecution, that Hungary is making serious efforts to address these problems, and that the police and government officials are both willing and able to protect victims."
[18]
The Board noted the progress of prosecutions in cases where Roma were the victims of violent attacks, as well as the creation in 2009 of a task force for investigating anti-Roma attacks and the strengthening of that task force in 2010. It found that the "documentary evidence shows that police take action when racially-motivated criminal acts are perpetrated by extremist groups, including purported members of the banned Hungarian Guard." It noted Criminal Code provisions and amendments targeting incitement of hatred and hate-inspired violence, and found that the central government did not support, condone or acquiesce to discrimination and racism against the country's minorities, including Roma. While there were reports of police corruption and use of excessive force against Roma, there were penalties in place for officers found guilty of wrongdoing, and evidence indicating that "it is reasonable to expect authorities to take action in these cases." The Board noted a number of complaint mechanisms and oversight bodies, including the Independent Police Complaints Board (IPCB), complaint procedures within the police hierarchy, and the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities (Minorities Obudsman). Thus, while "criticism of Hungary's treatment of the Roma is warranted," the Hungarian government is "motivated and willing to implement measures to protect the Roma" and there were "specific examples of how this is effective at the operational level." The Board observed (Decision at para 62):
...[R]egarding the totality of the evidence before me, while there is evidence to indicate that police do still commit abuses against people, including Roma, the evidence also demonstrates that it is reasonable to expect authorities to take action in these cases and that the police are both willing and capable of protecting Roma and that there are organizations in place to ensure that the police are held accountable. Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, the presumption that adequate state protection exists in Hungary is not rebutted.
[19]
With respect to broader issues of discrimination, the Board found that redress could be sought through the Equal Treatment Authority, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Civil Rights (PCCR), the Hungarian Labour Inspectorate, the National Consumer Protection Authority, the Commissioner for Educational Rights, the Health Insurance Supervisory Authority, the Patients' Rights Representatives, and the Central Office of Justice, as well as the courts. The Board observed (Decision at para 83):
... it is not only the police authority from whom claimants are expected to seek state protection. In instances of systemic discrimination, where the state has in place other institutions to provide civil remedies, it is reasonable for the claimant to seek redress from those institutions.
[20]
Thus, the Board concluded (Decision at para 86) as follows:
Based on the totality of the evidence ... I find that the claimants had and have recourse to seek remedies against institutional and non-institutional discrimination and racist practices, to obtain state protection against violence, and that there are numerous mechanisms in place to seek redress if they were to be denied protection by the police due to their Roma ethnicity.
ISSUES
[21]
The Applicants raise the following issues in this application:
a. Did the Board err by failing to reasonably assess the evidence as a whole and by not having regard to the totality of the evidence?
b. Did the Board err in the definition and/or assessment of credibility and state protection?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[22]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is settled in a satisfactory manner by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless, or where the relevant precedents appear to be inconsistent with new developments in the common law principles of judicial review, must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[23]
The parties are in agreement that a standard of reasonableness applies in reviewing the Board's conclusions on credibility and state protection: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Applicants' also raise the issue of whether the Board applied the right "definition" of state protection, which I take to be a question of whether the Board applied the proper test. This Court has recently affirmed that issue of whether the proper test for state protection was applied is reviewable on a standard of correctness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Buri
]. On the other hand, the issue of whether the Board erred in applying the settled law on state protection to the facts of a particular case is a question of mixed fact and law that is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. In this case, I think the real issue is not whether the Board properly understood the test, but whether it erred in applying it, which is a question upon which the deferential standard of reasonableness applies.
[24]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
STATUTORY PROVISIONS
[25]
The following provisions of the Act are applicable in these proceedings:

ARGUMENT <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [26]
The Applicants argue that the Board's credibility and state protection findings were both unreasonable, and that the Decision should therefore be set aside.
[27]
With respect to credibility, the Applicants argue that, unless contradicted or undermined, the allegations of the Applicants should be accepted as fact:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  167 FTR 309 (TD). The benefit of unsupported doubts must go to the person giving the evidence:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[28]
The Applicants say there were no omissions, contradictions or inconsistencies in their evidence that were not reasonably explained. Rather, the credibility finding resulted from a "microscopic" analysis in search of inconsistencies, focusing on peripheral details in the evidence and ignoring serious incidents that were central to the evidence:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  99 NR 168 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Applicants quote from Justice Rennie's judgment in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> where he observed in part:
19 The Manual cautions against dwelling on credibility concerns relating to peripheral details of a traumatic event. The Board should not have inflated expectations in terms of accuracy and consistency of recall ...
[...]
21 The Manual also notes that a claimant may be fabricating aspects of a story but still fulfill the criteria for refugee protection. False allegations exist on a spectrum, from a slightly distorted report to a complete fabrication. Accordingly, the Board was obliged to carefully consider what aspects of a story could be corroborated with supporting evidence...
[29]
The Applicants argue that the inconsistency regarding the date of the attack in the park was a simple mistake or typographical error in the PIF, and it was unreasonable not to accept this explanation. The same is true on the issue of whether the Applicants sought medical attention after the attack: the PIF stated that medical attention was received, but the Applicants corrected this error during testimony. They argue that the evidence on who reported this incident to police was clear and consistent, but the Board created a possible contradiction through its mode of questioning and then wrongly concluded that Ms. Rusznyak "could not keep her story straight." The testimony regarding the negative reaction of the police was not an omission from the PIF but simply an elaboration. Mr. Rusznyak's explanation that he did not know exactly when the incident at the lake happened was also reasonable. Everyone is liable to make mistakes, and no recall is expected to be perfect. With respect to the complaint to the mayor, Ms. Rusznyak simply testified honestly that she did not know what, if anything, the racist mayor did about her complaint. In its fervent effort to find contradictions, the Board missed what was truly relevant about this evidence: the discriminatory act and the lack of an adequate response.
[30]
Based on the evidence as a whole, the Applicants say, it was not reasonable for the Board to conclude that there were serious issues with their credibility. Rather than searching for inconsistencies, the Board should have tried to determine whether the Applicants had any credible evidence to offer:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  46 ACWS (3d) 101 (TD) at para 13. The Board is not entitled to draw a negative inference based on the omission of minor or elaborative details or peripheral matters from the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, SOR/2002-228, Rule 6(4) (repealed after the date of the Decision). None of the supposed omissions or contradictions at issue go to the heart of the claim so as to support a negative credibility finding:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (TD) at para 11. To support a negative credibility finding, an omission or inconsistency "should be major and not minor and sufficient by itself to call into question the applicant's credibility":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[31]
With respect to the absence of corroborative evidence such as police reports, the Applicants submit that, while the Board is justified in requiring corroboration where there are serious concerns with the overall credibility of the claims (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), no negative inference can be drawn from its absence unless there are valid reasons for doubting a applicant's credibility and the applicant has been unable to provide a reasonable explanation for the lack of corroborating material:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. Rejecting a reasonable explanation for the absence of corroborating material can lead to unfair and perverse findings:
Buri
, above, at para 6. The Applicants submit that they provided reasonable explanations for any omissions or inconsistencies such that there were no valid reasons for doubting their overall credibility, and they provided reasonable explanations for their inability to obtain the police reports.
[32]
The Applicants also argue that the Board should have considered the fact that Ms. Rusznyak's sisters were accepted as refugees based largely on the same evidence. While not determinative, the Applicants say this should have been considered in support of their credibility, the well-foundedness of their fear and the availability of state protection:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2002 FCT 91 (TD) at para 12. While it may not be bound by them, the Board must give clear and compelling reasons for departing from previous decisions, both as a matter of fairness to the Applicants and because the failure to do so results in inconsistent and arbitrary decision-making:
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Applicants question how the same Board member could reach opposite conclusions on state protection for similarly situated family members based on the same evidence: either there is state protection available in Hungary for persons in the Applicants' situation or there is not:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Alexander
].
[33]
The Applicants argue that it was incongruous and contradictory for the Board to add the "alternative" finding about state protection. In their view, this demonstrates that the Board was uncertain about its credibility assessment and was searching for any justification to reject their claim:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  argue that the state protection analysis itself was superficial and inadequate and wholly influenced by the negative credibility finding. The Board's conclusion on state protection is contrary to its own findings, including that: the situation for the Roma has worsened rather than improved and anti-Roma attitudes are becoming more open (Decision at para 24); segregation has increased (Decision at para 26); police use excessive force against Roma (Decision at paras 27 and 55); and, the central government's general failure to maintain strong and effective control mechanisms over rights violations takes its toll on the Roma minority (Decision at para 63). The Applicants argue that the evidence is anything but mixed, as the Board pointed to no evidence that the police are protecting the Roma some of the time.
[35]
While the Board correctly stated that it should look at what is "actually happening not what the state is endeavouring to put in place" (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]), the Applicants say that in actual fact the Board found "serious efforts" to be enough, which is contrary to recent jurisprudence. Serious efforts do not equal adequate protection:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). These efforts must have "actually translated into adequate state protection" at the operational level: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 5;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> mong others. Furthermore, it is an error to focus on inadequate efforts to seek state protection where no adequate protection exists: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 21;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[36]
Furthermore, the Applicants argue, the various organizations and complaint mechanisms cited by the Board, such as the Equal Treatment Authority, the Minorities Ombudsman and the Roma Police Officers Association, do not provide protection. The police force is "presumed to be the main institution mandated to protect citizens," and "other governmental or private institutions are presumed not to have the means nor the mandate to assume that responsibility":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The fact that perpetrators may be unknown does not absolve the police from investigating complaints:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Applicants note that this Court has previously found that the Roma have good reason to fear the police in Hungary (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). They argue that the evidence points to systemic, nationwide problems with state protection, and the Board's conclusion on state protection is therefore unreasonable.
Respondent
[37]
The Respondent argues that the Applicants have merely expressed their displeasure with the Board's credibility and state protection findings, and that such displeasure, however earnest, does not establish a reviewable error.
[38]
With respect to credibility, the Respondent notes that this is "the heartland of the Board's jurisdiction" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), and argues that the Board is entitled to make credibility findings on the basis of implausibilities, contradictions, irrationality and common sense, and may do so even where those deficiencies are not related to central aspects of the claim:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . When challenging such findings, an applicant must do more than demonstrate that the evidence could have supported a different conclusion; they must show that the Board's finding was unreasonable:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[39]
The Applicants' argument that the Board engaged in a "microscopic" analysis suffers from the very infirmity of which it accuses the Board. By highlighting narrow factual discrepancies, the Applicants lose sight of the fact that any review of the Board's credibility assessment ought to be holistic. The Reasons show that the Board's credibility concerns, while largely driven by the discrepancies between the Applicants' written and oral evidence, arose from the Board's specific interactions with the Applicants during the hearing (Decision at paras 14-15). The Board was in the optimal position to assess the credibility of the Applicants' claims. The Applicants have not shown that the Board's findings were unreasonable, and therefore the Court should not interfere:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[40]
The Applicants are incorrect in arguing that the Board should have considered that the RPD granted the refugee claim of Ms. Rusznyak's sister on the basis of similar evidence. The Board is not obliged to consider the claims of the Applicants' family when assessing their claim, because refugee status is determined on a case by case basis, and because previous decisions might be incorrect:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Jackson
].
[41]
In the alternative, the Respondent argues that any error in the credibility analysis is immaterial because the Board's finding on state protection, unless unreasonable, would be dispositive of the application:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[42]
The Respondent argues that the Board cannot be faulted for proceeding to make a state protection finding "in the alternative," as it would be absurd to fault the Board for adjudicating a refugee claim
more
conscientiously.
[43]
Furthermore, the Board's assessment of the documentary evidence is thorough and balanced and evinces justification, transparency and intelligibility. The Applicants' argument that the Board erred by focusing on state protection "efforts" rather than state protection "abilities" is readily debunked by the Reasons themselves (see Decision at paras 40, 60). The suggestion that the Board was unable to point to any evidence that Hungarian police are protecting Roma rests upon a misconception of the Board's role in the refugee process. As the RPD pointed out, "the Board is not obliged to prove that Hungary can offer the claimant effective state protection, rather the claimant bears the legal burden of rebutting the presumption that adequate state protection exists by adducing clear and convincing evidence which satisfies the Board on a balance of probabilities" (Decision at paras 34-36). In failing to establish that they made all reasonable attempts to seek state protection in Hungary, the Applicants clearly failed to meet this burden:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 29-34, 44-51.
ANALYSIS
[44]
The Applicants have made strenuous efforts to undermine the Board's credibility and state protection analyses and urge the Court to find them unreasonable.
[45]
The credibility findings were based upon "cumulative" inconsistencies. Whether these inconsistencies were sufficient to support a general finding that the Applicants lacked credibility, so as to impugn all of their evidence, is in my view a central issue in this case. It is clear that the RPD made such a finding (Decision at para 19), and that it was essential to the Decision. The question is whether this general finding was reasonable.
[46]
In my view, this is a very borderline case on this issue. However, in the Decision the Board itself made it clear that the credibility finding was based upon cumulative concerns:
[19] When I consider the evidence as a whole, the evidence raises serious issues related to the credibility of the claimants. The sworn testimony of a claimant is presumed to be truthful, unless there is valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. The female claimant and the claimant in this case have failed to advance their claims with evidence that is consistent or credible.
I am aware that none of the credibility concerns raised here may be sufficient, each on its own, to negate this claim. However, the cumulative effect of all of them is that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the female claimant and claimant are Convention refugees
. As the Court of Appeal in [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA)], MacGuigan, J.A. held:
... even without disbelieving every word [a claimant] has uttered, a ... panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes that there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim ... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from his testimony.
The female claimant and that claimant are, therefore, not Convention refugees.
[Emphasis added]
[47]
It is my view that the reliance upon the minor discrepancies in dates was too microscopic and unreasonable. Indeed, I think that reasonable explanations were offered for most of the inconsistencies. However, because the Board's credibility finding was "cumulative" it is not possible to say whether, without these errors, it would have reached the same conclusions about general credibility. This means that, in my view, the general credibility finding is unsafe and unreasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . However, this does not end the matter because the Board makes an "alternative" adequate state protection finding. The Applicants say that this finding is undermined by the negative credibility finding, but I don't think it is. I agree with the Respondent that what the board means by "alternative" in this instance is that, even if the Board accepts that the events happened as the Applicants say, and the Applicants went to the police, the Applicants have still not rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection.
[48]
Even if the Applicants could not be believed on all aspects of their claim, it was certainly clear that the Applicants were Roma people who had come to Canada from Hungary and who said they would face serious discrimination and persecution if returned. The Board acknowledges the very difficult situation faced by Roma people in Hungary. Hence, the Board was obliged to conduct a state protection analysis in order to determine whether the Applicants had rebutted the presumption of state protection: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Even a general finding of a lack of credibility does not end the inquiry if there is "independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim": see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[49]
Contrary to what the Applicants argue, it is my view that the Board conducted a detailed and reasonable state protection analysis which does examine "operational adequacy" as well as the serious efforts of the state to eradicate discrimination against the Roma people and to protect them from persecution and the brutal, racist violence that is often perpetrated against them. It is possible to disagree with this analysis but, in my view, it is not possible to say that it falls outside of the range posited by <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, except for one reason which I now turn to.
[50]
Where the Decision does become very problematic, in my view, is with regard to the Board's handling of the post-hearing submissions in which Applicants' counsel drew the Board's attention to the fact that the Board member who decided this claim had also decided on the same day the claim of one of Ms. Rusznyak's sisters and her family, and had granted refugee protection to that sister and her family. What is more, the refugee claim of another sister and her family had previously been accepted by another Member of the Board.
[51]
The Board's treatment of this issue is curt and, in my view, unreasonable:
Each claim is determined by its individual merits. It is not feasible to reach definitive findings for people who are family members. I am not bound by another decision I have made or by a decision made by another Member of the Board.
[52]
The Applicants did not allege that the Board was "bound" by any person's decision. They simply thought the treatment of the other sisters who had faced similar problems in Hungary was evidence of "similarly situated people" that should be considered by the Board.
[53]
In the present case, this renders the Board's state protection analysis problematic. It is true, of course, that in considering state protection the Board takes into account the evidence as to how individual applicants sought protection from the state authorities. But in the present case, the state protection finding is presented as an "alternative" to the credibility findings and is, in any event, a very comprehensive examination of the Hungarian state's willingness and ability to protect its Roma citizens based on the documentary evidence. It is strange then, that the Member would conclude that one sister had rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection and the other sister had not on the same day and on the basis of the same information package.
[54]
The Respondent directs me to the decision in
Jackson
, above, at paras 39-40. However, I don't think Justice Gagné was dealing in
Jackson
with quite the same issue as is before me. It is accepted that the Board is not bound by the result in another claim, even if the claim involves a relative, because refugee status is determined on a case-by-case basis and because it is possible that the other decision was incorrect. The issue before me, however, involves an "alternative" state protection finding based upon the same package of documents that, on the same day, the same Member had used to find that the presumption of state protection had been rebutted.
[55]
As the Applicants point out, there is strong recent case law from this Court that the Applicants were entitled to a full explanation of why this particular Board member, reviewing the same documents on the same issues on the same day could reach a different conclusion. See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 17-19. Justice Harrington followed
Siddiqui,
in
Alexander
, above:
[8] Although the standard of review is reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) and although there may be more than one reasonable decision, either there is state protection available for persons in Ms. Alexander's situation or there is not.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Mr. Justice Phelan was reviewing a decision in which the MQM-A of Pakistan was found to be a terrorist organization. There had been earlier decisions to the contrary. I fully subscribe to what he said at paragraphs 17 and 18:
[17] There is no strict legal requirement that the Board members must follow the factual findings of another member. This is particularly so where there is one of the "reasonableness" standards in play - reasonable people can reasonably disagree.
[18] What undermines the Board's decision is the failure to address the contradictory finding in the Memon decision. It may well be that the member disagreed with the findings in Memon and may have had good sustainable reasons for so doing. However, the Applicant is entitled, as a matter of fairness and the rendering of a full decision, to an explanation of why this particular member, reviewing the same documents on the same issue, could reach a different conclusion.
[56]
Justice Lagacé also followed <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above:
[32] In the present instance, a member of the Immigration Division had previously determined that Mr. Osagie's national identity card was authentic. The Board was entitled to depart from this conclusion based on its own review of the evidence, and in fact did so. However, given the existence of the previous decision, the Board was required to explain why it was departing from the conclusion of the Immigration Division. The failure to do so results in inconsistent and arbitrary decision-making
[57]
In the present case, the Board was not bound by a previous decision, but it was bound to review the issue and explain why, based upon the same information package, state protection was not available in its other case but was available to the Applicants. As Justice Harrington says in
Alexander
, above, either there is state protection available for persons in the Applicants' situation or there is not. In my view, the Board's failure to address this issue renders its state protection analysis unreasonable.
[58]
In conclusion, then, I find that the Decision is unreasonable and must be returned for reconsideration.
[59]
Counsel agrees that there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[60]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that:
1. The application is allowed. The Decision is quashed and the matter is returned for reconsideration by a differently constituted Board; and
2. There is no question for certification.

Dezso Rusznyak,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Russell
[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi] en vue d'obtenir le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision en date du 23 novembre 2012 [la décision] par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la SPR ou la Commission] a rejeté la demande présentée par les demandeurs en vue de se faire reconnaître la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ou celle de personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.
CONTEXTE
[2]
Les demandeurs sont des citoyens de la Hongrie et ils sont d'origine ethnique rome. Ils allèguent avoir été victimes de persécution et de discrimination en raison de leur origine ethnique et affirment avoir raison de craindre d'être persécutés s'ils devaient retourner en Hongrie. Ils sont arrivés au Canada le 19 mai 2011 et ont présenté leur demande d'asile le 21 mai 2011.
[3]
Les demandes étaient fondées sur un seul exposé circonstancié, celui de Dezsone Rusznyak [Mme Rusznyak] qui se trouvait dans son formulaire de renseignements personnels [FRP] et qu'elle avait rédigé en son nom personnel et au nom de son mari Dezso [M. Rusznyak] et de leur fille Brigitta, maintenant âgée de quatre ans. Dans cet exposé circonstancié, les demandeurs affirmaient craindre d'être agressés physiquement par des groupes racistes d'extrême droite en Hongrie, où, à leur avis, le nombre de ces agressions et de ces menaces était à la hausse depuis quelques années. Ils affirmaient avoir été victimes d'isolement à l'école et s'être vus refuser l'accès aux études après la huitième année. Ils soutenaient avoir, de même que les membres de leurs familles, été agressés physiquement à plusieurs reprises par des skinheads ou par des membres de « la Garde hongroise ». Ils affirmaient que M. Rusznyak et son père avaient été agressés alors qu'ils pêchaient dans un lac de leur village en 2002, que les deux demandeurs adultes avaient été agressés par trois hommes alors qu'ils se promenaient dans un parc au printemps 2008, et qu'ils avaient reçus tous les deux reçu des coups de couteau lors de cet incident, et que M. Rusznyak avait été pris à partie et jeté dans un lac alors qu'il pêchait à l'été 2010. Mme Rusznyak affirmait que quatre membres de la Garde hongroise les ont agressées elle et sa sœur en 2008, lui faisant perdre deux dents et brisant l'une des côtes de sa sœur. Mme Rusznyak affirmait que sa sœur avait été agressée par des skinheads en 2000, que son frère avait été attaqué en 2001, qu'elle et ses parents avaient été expulsés d'une boutique par des skinheads en 2003, que le mari et le fils de sa sœur avaient été battus dans le village de Martonyi en août 2007 alors qu'ils participaient à une « fête villageoise », et que ses parents avaient été attaqués par des membres de la Garde hongroise au printemps 2009 alors qu'ils se rendaient au magasin. Les demandeurs ont expliqué qu'ils avaient signalé certains de ces incidents à la police qui, à leurs dires, a refusé de les aider ou les a informés peu de temps après que le dossier était clos faute d'éléments de preuve ou parce qu'on ignorait l'identité des auteurs des actes en question.
[4]
Les demandeurs affirment également qu'ils étaient victimes de discrimination chaque jour et ont raconté qu'on leur refusait l'accès aux autobus, aux piscines publiques, ainsi qu'à un pub local où des personnes les avaient traités de [traduction] « sales gitans » et avaient proféré d'autres insultes.
[5]
Les demandes d'asile des demandeurs ont été examinées conjointement par la SPR le 2 novembre 2012. M Rusznyak agissait comme représentant désigné de sa fille. Les trois demandes d'asile ont été rejetées par décision datée du 23 novembre 2012. Mme Rusznyak était le principal témoin à l'audience et son mari a également témoigné brièvement.
[6]
Madame Rusznyak affirme que deux de ses sœurs et les membres de leurs familles sont arrivés au Canada vers la même époque et se sont vus reconnaître la qualité de réfugié en alléguant essentiellement les mêmes faits. La demande d'asile d'une des familles en question a été examinée et accueillie le même jour par le même commissaire qui a rendu la décision en litige en l'espèce.
DÉCISION À L'EXAMEN
[7]
Suivant la SPR, les questions déterminantes en l'espèce étaient celles de la crédibilité et de la protection de l'État.
[8]
Sur la question de crédibilité, la Commission a conclu que Mme Rusznyak n'était pas un témoin digne de foi et que, partant, elle ne disposait pas de suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi pour pouvoir conclure que les demandeurs étaient des réfugiés au sens de la Convention. À titre subsidiaire, la Commission a conclu que les demandeurs disposaient d'une protection de l'État suffisante en Hongrie.
[9]
La Commission a relevé de graves contradictions entre le FRP de Mme Rusznyak et le témoignage qu'elle avait donné à l'audience, ainsi que des incohérences importantes au sujet desquelles Mme Rusznyak n'avait pas donné d'explications raisonnables lorsque l'occasion lui en avait été offerte. L'exposé circonstancié du FRP indiquait que l'agression survenue dans le parc avait eu lieu au printemps 2008, tandis que Mme Rusznyak avait dit dans son témoignage qu'elle s'était produite au printemps 2009 alors qu'elle était enceinte. La Commission a écarté l'explication de Mme Rusznyak suivant laquelle elle avait commis une erreur dans son FRP en estimant qu'elle avait associé sa première grossesse à cet incident et qu'il était donc peu probable qu'elle ait commis une erreur au sujet de la date à laquelle il était survenu. La Commission a également constaté une divergence en ce qui concerne la question de savoir si les demandeurs avaient consulté un médecin à la suite de cette agression. Le FPR indiquait que les demandeurs avaient été traités par l'assistant d'un médecin, tandis que Mme Rusznyak avait expliqué qu'elle n'avait pas demandé de soins médicaux. La SPR n'a pas retenu l'explication suivant laquelle les demandeurs avaient confondu les dates alors qu'ils rédigeaient l'exposé circonstancié en raison de leurs nombreuses blessures. La Commission a également relevé des incohérences dans les éléments de preuve portant sur l'identité de la personne qui avait signalé cet incident à la police ainsi que la réponse de la police, et elle a fait observer qu'interrogée au sujet de ces divergences, Mme Rusznyak « avait de la difficulté à mettre de l'ordre dans son récit ». En raison de ces incohérences, la SPR n'était pas « convaincu[e] que [les demandeurs d'asile] ont réellement été attaqués dans un parc par trois personnes au comportement raciste ».
[10]
La Commission a également relevé des incohérences dans la preuve présentée par les demandeurs au sujet de la plainte qu'ils avaient déposée devant le maire de leur village au sujet du fait qu'on avait refusé de les servir dans un pub/café local et de la réponse du maire. Le FPR indiquait que le maire avait refusé de s'en mêler, tandis que Mme Rusznyak avait expliqué que le maire lui avait dit qu'il parlerait au propriétaire du pub sans toutefois savoir s'il était effectivement intervenu. Mme Rusznyak avait également allégué dans son témoignage que le maire était raciste et qu'il faisait partie de groupes racistes, ce qu'elle n'a pas déclaré dans son FPR. La SPR a estimé que Mme Rusznyak avait embelli son histoire. De plus, le témoignage de M. Rusznyak différait des allégations contenues dans le FPR en ce qui concerne l'année où il avait été pris à partie et jeté dans un lac alors qu'il pêchait. Interrogé au sujet de cette divergence, M. Rusznyak a expliqué qu'il ne savait pas exactement à quelle date cet incident avait eu lieu.
[11]
La Commission a également fait observer que les demandeurs affirmaient avoir signalé les incidents à la police à de nombreuses reprises sans toutefois produire de rapport de police. Interrogée à ce sujet, Mme Rusznyak a expliqué qu'elle avait demandé à sa sœur qui habitait en Hongrie d'obtenir les rapports en question, mais qu'on avait dit à sa sœur que Mme Rusznyak devait se présenter en personne pour les obtenir. Elle a expliqué qu'elle n'avait pas demandé à ses beaux-parents d'obtenir les rapports malgré le fait que, suivant son témoignage, ces derniers avaient participé à certains des signalements faits à la police. La SPR a conclu que « la demandeure d'asile n'a pas déposé en preuve des documents pertinents à l'appui de sa demande d'asile, comme il lui incombe de le faire » et elle a fait observer que « la demandeure d'asile aurait pu au moins demander à ses beaux-parents d'obtenir un rapport de la police ». La Commission a rappelé que l'article 7 des
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
prévoit que le demandeur d'asile doit « transmet[tre] à la Section des documents acceptables qui permettent d'établir son identité et les autres éléments de sa demande d'asile ». S'il ne peut le faire, il en donne la raison et indique au moins quelles mesures il a prises pour se procurer de tels documents ». La Commission a par conséquent conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient démontré ni qu'ils avaient été battus et blessés au cours d'une agression survenue en 2009 ni qu'on avait refusé de les servir dans un pub en raison de leur origine ethnique.
[12]
La Commission a ensuite tiré une conclusion plus générale au sujet de la crédibilité en se fondant sur les présumées contradictions et incohérences susmentionnées. Voici ce que la Commission a déclaré (au paragraphe 19 de sa décision):
[19] Lorsque j'examine la preuve relative à la présente demande d'asile dans son ensemble, je constate qu'elle soulève de sérieux doutes quant à la crédibilité des demandeurs d'asile. Le témoignage sous serment des demandeurs d'asile est présumé vrai, à moins qu'il existe des raisons valables de douter de sa véracité. En l'espèce, la demandeure d'asile et le demandeur d'asile n'ont pas réussi à étayer leurs demandes d'asile avec des éléments de preuve cohérents ou crédibles. Je sais qu'aucune des questions de crédibilité soulevées en l'espèce ne peut à elle seule justifier le rejet de la demande d'asile. Toutefois, lorsqu'elles sont prises en compte dans leur ensemble, je ne dispose pas d'une preuve crédible et digne de foi suffisante pour conclure que la demandeure d'asile et le demandeur d'asile ont qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention. Le juge MacGuigan de la Cour d'appel a mentionné ce qui suit dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF)]:
[...] même sans mettre en doute chacune des paroles du [demandeur d'asile], le [tribunal] peut douter raisonnablement de sa crédibilité au point de conclure qu'il n'existe aucun élément de preuve crédible ayant trait à la [demande d'asile] [...] En d'autres termes, la conclusion générale du manque de crédibilité du demandeur de statut peut fort bien s'étendre à tous les éléments de preuve pertinents de son témoignage.
En conséquence, la demandeure d'asile et le demandeur d'asile n'ont pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention.
[13]
La SPR a poursuivi en déclarant ce qui suit: « À titre subsidiaire, je conclus que les demandeurs d'asile bénéficient d'une protection adéquate de l'État, cette question ayant été soulevée au début de l'audience ».
[14]
La SPR a fait observer qu'il incombait aux demandeurs de réfuter la présomption de la protection de l'État au moyen d'éléments de preuve « clairs et convaincants » quant à l'incapacité de l'État de protéger ses citoyens, et de démontrer qu'ils avaient pris toutes les mesures raisonnables dans les circonstances pour obtenir cette protection.
[15]
La Commission a reconnu que la preuve documentaire démontrait que « l'attitude de certains Hongrois, dont des personnes en position d'autorité, à l'égard des Roms est discriminatoire et préjudiciable », que « les Roms subissent de la discrimination dans presque toutes les sphères de leur vie », que « la situation des Roms ne s'est pas améliorée, elle s'est plutôt aggravée » et que « les attitudes anti-Roms précédemment dissimulées deviennent de plus en plus exposées ». En ce qui concerne la police, la Commission a fait observer que « [p]armi les autres difficultés en matière des droits de la personne survenues au cours de l'année [2012], mentionnons l'usage d'une force excessive par la police contre les suspects, particulièrement les suspects roms » et que « [l]es Roms victimes d'actes criminels sont très souvent traités de façon discriminatoire par la police; les policiers hésitent à consigner leurs déclarations, en particulier le caractère raciste du crime signalé ». Se fondant sur ces éléments de preuve, la Commission a déclaré ce qui suit (au paragraphe 31 de sa décision):
Je reconnais que la preuve fait état d'incidents répandus d'intolérance, de discrimination et de persécution envers les Roms en Hongrie, et j'en ai tenu compte.
[16]
Et plus loin (au paragraphe 42 de sa décision):
Une lecture objective de la preuve documentaire démontre que le gouvernement central est motivé et disposé à mettre en œuvre des mesures pour protéger les Roms, mais que ces mesures ne sont pas toujours appliquées efficacement à l'échelle locale ou municipale. La preuve documentaire n'est pas uniforme en ce qui a trait aux efforts du gouvernement visant à protéger les Roms et à prendre des mesures législatives contre des formes plus larges de discrimination et de persécution.
[17]
La Commission a néanmoins conclu ce qui suit (au paragraphe 43 de sa décision:
[L]a preuve objective en ce qui concerne la situation actuelle dans le pays laisse croire que, même si elle n'est pas parfaite, la protection offerte par l'État hongrois aux Roms victimes de criminalité, d'abus de pouvoir de la part des policiers, de discrimination ou de persécution est adéquate, que la Hongrie déploie de sérieux efforts pour régler ces problèmes et que la police et les représentants du gouvernement veulent protéger les victimes et sont en mesure de le faire.
[18]
La Commission a pris acte des progrès réalisés en ce qui concerne la situation des Roms victimes d'agressions violentes, ainsi que la création, en 2009, d'un groupe de travail chargé d'enquêter sur les agressions commises contre les Roms, ainsi que le renforcement de ce groupe de travail en 2010. Elle a constaté que « [l]a preuve documentaire démontre que la police prend les mesures nécessaires lorsque des actes criminels à caractère raciste sont perpétrés par des groupes extrémistes, y compris les présumés membres de la Garde hongroise dissoute ». La Commission a signalé les dispositions du Code criminel et les modifications apportées à celui-ci pour réprimer l'incitation à la haine et les actes de violence inspirés par la haine et a conclu que le gouvernement central n'appuyait pas, ne tolérait pas et n'approuvait pas la discrimination et le racisme contre les minorités du pays, y compris les Roms. Malgré l'existence de rapports faisant état de corruption au sein de la police et de recours à une force excessive contre les Roms, des peines étaient prévues pour punir les policiers reconnus coupables de méfaits et la preuve démontrait qu' « il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que les autorités prennent des mesures pour remédier à ces cas ». La Commission a relevé l'existence de plusieurs mécanismes de règlement des plaintes et d'organismes de surveillance, dont la Commission indépendante des plaintes contre la police (CIPP), de mécanismes de règlement des plaintes au sein de la hiérarchie policière, et de l'existence d'un commissaire parlementaire aux droits des minorités nationales et ethniques (le protecteur des minorités). Ainsi, même si « la critique envers le traitement réservé aux Roms en Hongrie est justifiée », « le gouvernement hongrois est motivé et disposé à mettre en œuvre des mesures afin de protéger les Roms » et il existe « des exemples précis de leur application sur le plan opérationnel ». La Commission a fait observer (au paragraphe 62 de sa décision):
[...] [D]'après l'ensemble de la preuve dont je dispose, bien qu'il existe des éléments de preuve démontrant que la police commet encore des abus contre certaines personnes, y compris les Roms, il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que les autorités agissent dans de tels cas, que la police est à la fois capable de protéger les Roms et disposée à le faire, et que des organisations ont été mises sur pied afin de veiller à ce qu'elle réponde de ses actes. Par conséquent, dans les circonstances de la présente affaire, la présomption de l'existence d'une protection adéquate de l'État en Hongrie n'a pas été réfutée.
[19]
En ce qui concerne les questions plus larges de discrimination, la Commission a estimé qu'outre les tribunaux, il était possible d'obtenir réparation auprès de l'autorité pour l'égalité de traitement, du commissaire parlementaire aux droits civils, de l'inspection générale de sécurité et santé au travail de la Hongrie, du bureau national de protection des consommateurs, du commissaire aux droits en matière d'éducation, du Service de supervision en matière d'assurance maladie, des représentants des droits des patients et du Bureau central de justice. La Commission a fait observer (au paragraphe 83 de sa décision):
Les demandeurs d'asile ne sont pas tenus de s'adresser uniquement aux autorités policières pour obtenir la protection de l'État. Dans les cas de discrimination systémique, si l'État a mis sur pied d'autres institutions qui permettent d'intenter des recours civils, il est raisonnable que le demandeur d'asile demande réparation auprès de ces institutions.
[20]
La Commission a par conséquent conclu ce qui suit (au paragraphe 86):
[...] selon l'ensemble de la preuve présentée en l'espèce, je conclus que les demandeurs d'asile pouvaient exercer et peuvent encore exercer des recours contre les pratiques discriminatoires et racistes institutionnelles et non institutionnelles et obtenir la protection de l'État contre la violence, et qu'il existe de nombreux mécanismes qui permettraient aux demandeurs d'asile de demander réparation si la police refusait de leur accorder une protection ou ne prenait pas leurs plaintes au sérieux en raison de leur origine ethnique rom.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[21]
Les demandeurs soulèvent les questions suivantes dans la présente demande:
a. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en n'appréciant pas de façon raisonnable la preuve comme un tout et en ne tenant pas compte de l'ensemble de la preuve?
b. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur dans sa définition et/ou son appréciation de la crédibilité et de la protection de l'État?
NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[22]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour suprême du Canada a déclaré qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de se livrer à une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle. Ainsi, lorsque la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la question particulière dont la cour est saisie a été établie de manière satisfaisante par la jurisprudence, il est loisible à la cour chargée du contrôle de l'adopter. Ce n'est que dans les cas où cette recherche s'avère infructueuse, ou si la jurisprudence semble devenue incompatible avec l'évolution récente des principes de la common law en matière de contrôle judiciaire, que la cour chargée du contrôle doit entreprendre l'examen des quatre facteurs entrant en jeu dans l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
Les parties s'entendent pour dire que c'est la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable qui s'applique lorsqu'il s'agit de procéder au contrôle des conclusions tirées par la Commission sur la crédibilité et la protection de l'État (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 16). Les demandeurs soulèvent également la question de savoir si la Commission a appliqué la bonne « définition » de la notion de protection de l'État qui, sauf erreur, concerne la question de savoir si la Commission a appliqué le bon critère. Notre Cour a récemment affirmé que la question de savoir si le bon critère a été appliqué à la question de la protection de l'État est une question assujettie à la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 18 [
Buri
]). En revanche, la question de savoir si la Commission a commis une erreur en appliquant les règles de droit établies concernant la protection de l'État aux faits d'une affaire déterminée est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui est assujettie à la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, j'estime que la véritable question n'est pas celle de savoir si la Commission a bien saisi le critère applicable, mais bien celle de savoir si elle a commis une erreur en l'appliquant, ce qui constitue une question à laquelle s'applique la norme déférente de la décision raisonnable.
[24]
Lors d'un contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse a trait à « la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel [ainsi qu'à] l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Autrement dit, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la décision est déraisonnable, en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
DISPOSITIONS LÉGISLATIVES APPLICABLES
[25]
Voici les dispositions de la Loi qui s'appliquent dans la présente instance:
Définition de « réfugié »

(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats
Convention refugee
96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(
b
) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(
a
) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
ARGUMENTATIONS
Les demandeurs
[26]
Les demandeurs affirment que les conclusions tirées par la Commission au sujet de la crédibilité et de la protection de l'État sont toutes les deux déraisonnables et que sa décision devrait par conséquent être annulée.
[27]
En ce qui concerne la question de la crédibilité, les demandeurs soutiennent qu'à moins d'être contredites ou mises en doute, leurs allégations doivent être tenues pour avérées (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  167 FTR 309 (CF 1re inst.). La personne qui rend témoignage doit bénéficier de tout doute non étayé (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[28]
Les demandeurs affirment qu'il n'y avait, dans leur témoignage, aucune omission, contradiction ou incohérence qu'ils n'ont pas expliquée de façon logique. La conclusion tirée au sujet de la crédibilité par la Commission était le fruit d'une analyse « microscopique » axée sur la recherche d'incohérences et sur des détails secondaires de la preuve et la Commission a ignoré des incidents sérieux qui constituaient un aspect essentiel de la preuve (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  99 NR 168 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Les demandeurs citent les propos tenus par le juge Rennie dans le jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 21, où le juge Rennie fait notamment observer ce qui suit:
19 Selon le Guide, il faut éviter de s'attarder aux doutes quant à la crédibilité engendrés par les détails circonstanciés de l'événement traumatique. La Commission ne devrait pas s'attendre à une grande exactitude et à une grande cohérence de remémoration [...]
[...]
21 Le Guide signale aussi qu'un demandeur peut inventer certains aspects de son récit et néanmoins satisfaire aux critères d'octroi de l'asile. Les fausses allégations se situent sur une échelle, qui va du compte-rendu légèrement déformé à une histoire inventée de toutes pièces. En conséquence, la Commission était tenue de vérifier minutieusement quels aspects du récit pouvaient être corroborés au moyen d'une preuve supplémentaire [...]
[29]
Les demandeurs affirment que l'incohérence signalée au sujet de la date à laquelle l'agression avait eu lieu dans le parc était une simple erreur ou faute de frappe commise dans le FRP et qu'il était déraisonnable de ne pas accepter l'explication qu'ils ont donnée à ce sujet. Il en allait de même selon eux en ce qui concerne la question de savoir si les demandeurs avaient cherché à obtenir des soins médicaux après leur agression: le FRP indiquait qu'ils avaient effectivement reçu des soins médicaux, mais les demandeurs ont rectifié cette erreur au cours de leur témoignage. Ils soutiennent que la preuve portant sur l'identité de la personne qui avait signalé l'incident à la police était claire et cohérente, mais que la Commission a créé une éventuelle contradiction en raison de la façon dont elle a posé ses questions pour ensuite conclure que Mme Rusznyak « avait de la difficulté à mettre de l'ordre dans son récit ». Les explications fournies au sujet de la réaction négative de la police n'avaient pas été omises du FRP mais étaient un simple développement. L'explication de M. Rusznyak suivant laquelle il ignorait la date exacte à laquelle l'incident du lac avait eu lieu était également raisonnable. L'erreur est humaine et on ne peut s'attendre à ce qu'une personne se rappelle avec précision tous les faits. En ce qui concerne la plainte portée devant le maire, Mme Rusznyak a simplement témoigné honnêtement qu'elle ignorait si ce maire raciste avait ou non donné suite à sa plainte. Dans son acharnement à trouver des contradictions, la Commission a négligé des éléments véritablement pertinents de la preuve, en l'occurrence, l'acte discriminatoire commis et l'absence de réaction adéquate des autorités.
[30]
Vu l'ensemble de la preuve, les demandeurs affirment qu'il n'était pas raisonnable de la part de la Commission de conclure que leur crédibilité soulevait de graves questions. Au lieu de se mettre à la recherche d'incohérences, la Commission aurait dû essayer de déterminer si les demandeurs avaient des éléments de preuve crédibles à offrir (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  46 ACWS (3d) 101 (CF 1re inst.), au paragraphe 13). La Commission n'a pas le droit de tirer une conclusion négative en se fondant sur une omission mineure ou sur des détails complémentaires ou des aspects accessoires du FRP (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-228, paragraphe 6(4) (abrogé après la date de la décision). Aucune des présumées omissions et contradictions en cause ne touche suffisamment à l'essence même de la demande d'asile pour justifier une conclusion négative au sujet de la crédibilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst), au paragraphe 11). Pour que le tribunal puisse tirer une conclusion négative au sujet de la crédibilité, l'omission ou l'incohérence doit « tirer à conséquence et doit suffire à elle seule à ébranler la crédibilité du demandeur » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 69 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[31]
En ce qui concerne l'absence d'éléments de preuve corroborants tels que des rapports de police, les demandeurs affirment que, bien qu'elle soit justifiée d'exiger une corroboration lorsqu'elle a de sérieuses réserves au sujet de la crédibilité générale des demandes (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 7), la Commission ne peut tirer de conclusion négative de l'absence de telle corroboration à moins qu'il n'existe des raisons valables de mettre en doute la crédibilité du demandeur et que ce dernier n'ait pas été en mesure de fournir d'explication raisonnable pour justifier l'absence d'éléments de preuve corroborants (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 23;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité). Écarter des explications raisonnables données pour justifier l'absence d'une preuve corroborante peut conduire à des conclusions injustes et arbitraires (
Buri
, précité, au paragraphe 6). Les demandeurs affirment qu'ils ont fourni des explications raisonnables sur les omissions ou incohérences soulevées et que la Commission n'avait donc aucune raison valable de mettre en doute leur crédibilité générale. Ils ont précisé qu'ils avaient fourni des explications raisonnables pour justifier leur incapacité d'obtenir les rapports de police.
[32]
Les demandeurs affirment également que la Commission aurait dû tenir compte du fait que les sœurs de Mme Rusznyak s'étaient vues reconnaître la qualité de réfugié sur le fondement d'essentiellement les mêmes éléments de preuve. Bien que ce facteur ne soit pas déterminant, les demandeurs affirment que la Commission aurait dû en tenir compte pour se prononcer en leur faveur en ce qui concerne leur crédibilité, le bien-fondé de leur crainte et la question de la possibilité d'obtenir la protection de l'État (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2002 CFPI 91 (CF 1re inst), au paragraphe 12). Bien qu'elle ne soit pas liée par elles, la Commission doit fournir des motifs clairs et convaincants pour s'écarter de ses propres décisions antérieures, tant par souci d'équité envers les demandeurs que parce que le défaut de le faire risque d'entraîner des décisions contradictoires et arbitraires (
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 20 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 32 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Les demandeurs s'interrogent sur la raison pour laquelle le même commissaire a pu tirer des conclusions opposées sur la question de la protection de l'État au sujet de membres de leur famille se trouvant dans une situation semblable à la leur, à la lumière des mêmes éléments de preuve: ou bien les personnes se trouvant dans la situation des demandeurs peuvent compter sur la protection de l'État en Hongrie ou bien elles ne le peuvent pas (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Alexander
]).
[33]
Les demandeurs affirment qu'il était incongru et contradictoire de la part de la Commission d'ajouter une conclusion « subsidiaire » au sujet de la protection de l'État. À leur avis, cette façon de procéder démontre que la Commission doutait de sa propre appréciation de la crédibilité et qu'elle cherchait une raison de rejeter leur demande (
Csiklya et autre c Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)
, 30 octobre 2012, IMM-654-12 (CF)).
[34]
Les demandeurs affirment que l'analyse de la protection de l'État elle-même était superficielle et insuffisante et qu'elle était entièrement influencée par la conclusion négative tirée par la Commission au sujet de leur crédibilité. La conclusion tirée par la Commission au sujet de la protection de l'État contredisait ses propres conclusions, y compris celle suivant laquelle la situation des Roms avait empiré au lieu de s'améliorer et que les comportements anti-roms étaient de plus en plus ouverts (paragraphe 24 de la décision); que la ségrégation avait augmenté (paragraphe 26 de la décision); que la police faisait usage de force excessive contre les Roms (paragraphes 27 et 55 de la décision); et que l'incapacité générale du gouvernement central à maintenir des mécanismes de contrôle solides et efficaces quant aux violations des droits de la personne avait des conséquences néfastes sur le groupe minoritaire le plus important de la Hongrie, les Roms (au paragraphe 63 de la décision). Les demandeurs soutiennent que la preuve est tout sauf mitigée, comme le démontre le fait que la Commission n'a signalé aucun élément de preuve permettant de conclure que la police protégeait à l'occasion les Roms.
[35]
Bien que la Commission ait déclaré à juste titre qu'elle devait tenir compte de « la situation réelle et non de ce que l'État se propose de faire ou a entrepris de mettre en place » (citant  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]), les demandeurs affirment qu'en réalité, la Commission a conclu qu'il suffisait que l'État fasse « de sérieux efforts », ce qui contredit la jurisprudence récente. Des efforts sérieux ne peuvent être assimilés à une protection adéquate ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 42;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 11 à 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 48;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 21 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Les efforts doivent avoir, dans les faits, « véritablement engendré une protection adéquate de l'État » sur le terrain (voir, entre autres, Hercegi, précité, au paragraphe 5;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). De plus, on fait erreur lorsqu'on se concentre sur l'insuffisance des efforts faits pour s'assurer la protection de l'État lorsque celle-ci est de toute façon inadéquate ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 21;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[36]
Les demandeurs font par ailleurs valoir que les divers organismes et mécanismes de règlement des plaintes cités par la Commission, tels que l'autorité pour l'égalité de traitement, le protecteur des minorités et l'Association des agents de police roms, ne leur offrent aucune protection. La police est « présumée être la principale institution chargée d'assurer la protection des citoyens » et « les autres institutions publiques ou privées sont présumées n'avoir ni les moyens ni le rôle d'assumer une telle responsabilité » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 17;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le fait qu'on ignore l'identité des auteurs des actes reprochés ne dispense pas la police de faire enquête sur les plaintes (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Les demandeurs rappellent que notre Cour a déjà jugé que les Roms ont de bonnes raisons de craindre la police en Hongrie (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Ils soutiennent que la preuve indique qu'il existe des problèmes systémiques à l'échelle du pays en ce qui concerne la protection de l'État, et que la conclusion tirée par la Commission au sujet de la protection de l'État est par conséquent déraisonnable.
Le défendeur
[37]
Le défendeur soutient que les demandeurs ont simplement exprimé leur mécontentement au sujet des conclusions tirées par la Commission sur la crédibilité et la protection de l'État, et qu'aussi profond que puisse être ce mécontentement, les demandeurs n'ont pas démontré l'existence d'une erreur justifiant l'intervention de notre Cour.
[38]
En ce qui concerne la crédibilité, le défendeur signale que cet aspect « constitue l'essentiel de la compétence de la Commission » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), et soutient que la Commission a le droit de tirer des conclusions au sujet de la crédibilité en se fondant sur des invraisemblances, des contradictions, des illogismes et le bon sens, et qu'elle peut le faire même lorsque les lacunes ainsi décelées ne se rapportent pas à des aspects centraux de la demande (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 17). Pour contester pareilles conclusions, le demandeur ne peut se contenter de démontrer que la preuve pouvait justifier une conclusion différente; il doit démontrer que la conclusion de la Commission était déraisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[39]
L'argument des demandeurs suivant lequel la Commission s'est livrée à une analyse « microscopique » souffre de la même lacune que celle qu'ils reprochent à la Commission. En insistant sur des divergences factuelles banales, les demandeurs perdent de vue que tout contrôle de l'appréciation que la Commission a faite de la crédibilité se doit d'être une évaluation globale. Or, il ressort des motifs de la Commission que même si les réserves qu'elle a formulées au sujet de la crédibilité dépendaient en grande partie des divergences qu'elle avait relevées entre la preuve écrite et le témoignage des demandeurs, ces réserves se fondaient sur des échanges précis qu'elle avait eus avec les demandeurs à l'audience (paragraphes 14 et 15 de la décision). La Commission se trouvait dans une position idéale pour apprécier la crédibilité des allégations des demandeurs. Ces derniers n'ont pas démontré que les conclusions de la Commission étaient déraisonnables; la Cour ne doit donc pas intervenir (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 4).
[40]
Les demandeurs ont tort de soutenir que la Commission aurait dû tenir compte du fait que la SPR avait reconnu la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention à la sœur de Mme Rusznyak sur le fondement d'éléments de preuve semblables. La Commission n'a pas l'obligation de tenir compte des demandes présentées par les membres de la famille du demandeur d'asile lorsqu'elle examine la demande de ce dernier, étant donné que la détermination du statut de réfugié se fait au cas par cas et qu'il est aussi possible que la décision antérieure soit erronée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 40 [
Jackson
]).
[41]
À titre subsidiaire, le défendeur soutient que toute erreur dont pourrait être entachée l'analyse de la crédibilité ne tire pas à conséquence étant donné qu'à moins qu'elle ne soit déraisonnable, la conclusion tirée par la Commission au sujet de la protection de l'État disposerait du sort de la demande (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[42]
Le défendeur affirme que l'on ne peut reprocher à la Commission d'avoir poursuivi en tirant une conclusion « subsidiaire » au sujet de la protection de l'État, étant donné qu'il serait absurde de reprocher à la Commission de trancher une demande d'asile de façon
plus
consciencieuse.
[43]
Qui plus est, l'analyse que la Commission a faite de la preuve documentaire était approfondie et équilibrée en plus d'être justifiée, transparente et intelligible. L'argument des demandeurs suivant lequel la Commission a commis une erreur en se concentrant sur les « efforts » faits par la Hongrie pour assurer la protection de l'État plutôt que sur l'« efficacité » de la protection de l'État est rapidement réfuté par les motifs eux-mêmes (paragraphes 40 et 60 de la décision). L'idée suivant laquelle la Commission n'a pu mettre le doigt sur quelque élément de preuve démontrant que la police hongroise protégeait les Roms repose sur une mauvaise perception du rôle que joue la Commission dans le cas du processus d'examen des demandes d'asile. Ainsi que la SPR l'a souligné, « [l]a Commission n'est pas tenue de prouver que l'État peut offrir une protection adéquate au demandeur d'asile; c'est plutôt à ce dernier qu'incombe le fardeau ultime de réfuter la présomption selon laquelle l'État peut lui fournir une protection adéquate, en présentant des éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants pour persuader la Commission selon la prépondérance des probabilités (paragraphes 34 à 36 de la décision). En ne démontrant pas qu'ils avaient fait toutes les démarches raisonnables pour chercher à obtenir la protection de l'État en Hongrie, les demandeurs ne se sont de toute évidence pas déchargés de ce fardeau ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité
,
aux paragraphes 29 à 34 et 44 à 51).
ANALYSE
[44]
Les demandeurs ont cherché énergiquement à ébranler l'analyse que la Commission a faite des questions de crédibilité et de protection de l'État, et ils demandent à la Cour de la considérer comme déraisonnable.
[45]
Les conclusions tirées au sujet de la crédibilité reposaient sur des incohérences « cumulatives ». La question de savoir si ces incohérences étaient suffisantes pour justifier une conclusion générale que les demandeurs manquaient de crédibilité au point où l'ensemble de la preuve s'en trouvait ébranlée est à mon avis au cœur de la présente affaire. Il est évident que la SPR a effectivement tiré cette conclusion (paragraphe 19 de sa décision) et que cette conclusion a joué un rôle essentiel dans sa décision. Il s'agit de savoir si cette conclusion générale était raisonnable.
[46]
On a affaire, à mon avis, à un cas tout à fait limite à cet égard. Toutefois, dans sa décision, la Commission a elle-même tenu à préciser que la conclusion qu'elle tirait au sujet de la crédibilité reposait sur l'accumulation de ses réserves:
[19] Lorsque j'examine la preuve relative à la présente demande d'asile dans son ensemble, je constate qu'elle soulève de sérieux doutes quant à la crédibilité des demandeurs d'asile. Le témoignage sous serment des demandeurs d'asile est présumé vrai, à moins qu'il existe des raisons valables de douter de sa véracité. En l'espèce, la demandeure d'asile et le demandeur d'asile n'ont pas réussi à étayer leurs demandes d'asile avec des éléments de preuve cohérents ou crédibles. Je sais qu'aucune des questions de crédibilité soulevées en l'espèce ne peut à elle seule justifier le rejet de la demande d'asile. Toutefois, lorsqu'elles sont prises en compte dans leur ensemble, je ne dispose pas d'une preuve crédible et digne de foi suffisante pour conclure que la demandeure d'asile et le demandeur d'asile ont qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention. Le juge MacGuigan de la Cour d'appel a mentionné ce qui suit dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF)]:
[...] même sans mettre en doute chacune des paroles du [demandeur d'asile], le [tribunal] peut douter raisonnablement de sa crédibilité au point de conclure qu'il n'existe aucun élément de preuve crédible ayant trait à la [demande d'asile] [...] En d'autres termes, la conclusion générale du manque de crédibilité du demandeur de statut peut fort bien s'étendre à tous les éléments de preuve pertinents de son témoignage.
En conséquence, la demandeure d'asile et le demandeur d'asile n'ont pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[47]
À mon avis, la Commission s'est effectivement livrée à une analyse trop microscopique et déraisonnable en se fondant sur des divergences mineures. J'estime d'ailleurs que des explications raisonnables ont été offertes pour justifier la plupart des incohérences. Toutefois, comme la conclusion tirée par la Commission au sujet de la crédibilité était « cumulative », on ne peut savoir si, sans ces erreurs, la Commission serait parvenue aux mêmes conclusions au sujet de la crédibilité générale. J'estime donc que la conclusion générale tirée par la Commission au sujet de la crédibilité est dangereuse et déraisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Il ne s'ensuit pas pour autant que le dossier est clos, étant donné que la Commission a tiré une conclusion « subsidiaire » au sujet du caractère suffisant de la protection de l'État. Le demandeur affirme que cette conclusion est viciée par la conclusion négative tirée au sujet de la crédibilité, mais je ne crois pas que ce soit le cas. Je suis d'accord avec le défendeur pour dire que, dans le cas qui nous occupe, la Commission voulait dire par « subsidiaire » que, même si elle reconnaissait que les faits s'étaient déroulés comme l'affirmaient les demandeurs et qu'ils s'étaient effectivement adressés à la police, les demandeurs n'avaient néanmoins pas réfuté la présomption de la protection suffisante de l'État.
[48]
Même si l'on ne pouvait croire les demandeurs sur tous les aspects de leur demande, il était certainement clair que les demandeurs étaient des Roms qui étaient venus au Canada en provenance de Hongrie parce qu'ils affirmaient craindre d'être victimes de grave discrimination et de persécution s'ils devaient retourner en Hongrie. La Commission a reconnu la situation très difficile avec laquelle les Roms doivent composer en Hongrie. La Commission avait donc l'obligation de procéder à une analyse de la protection de l'État pour déterminer si les demandeurs avaient réfuté la présomption de la protection de l'État (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 39;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 12;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 12;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Une conclusion générale de manque de crédibilité ne suffit pas si le dossier « comporte une preuve documentaire indépendante et crédible permettant d'étayer une décision favorable au demandeur » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[49]
Contrairement à ce que les demandeurs prétendent, j'estime que la Commission a procédé à une analyse détaillée et raisonnable de la question de la protection de l'État et qu'elle a examiné « la suffisance de la protection de l'État sur le terrain » ainsi que les efforts sérieux faits par l'État pour éradiquer la discrimination contre les Roms et pour protéger ces derniers contre la persécution ainsi que les actes de violence racistes et brutaux dont ils sont souvent victimes. Il est possible de ne pas souscrire à l'analyse de la Commission, mais j'estime qu'on ne peut pas affirmer que cette analyse n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables au sens de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, sauf sur un aspect bien précis sur lequel je tiens maintenant à m'attarder.
[50]
Là où la décision devient effectivement très problématique, à mon avis, c'est lorsque la Commission traite des observations qui lui ont été soumises après l'audience dans lesquelles l'avocat des demandeurs attire l'attention de la Commission sur le fait que le commissaire qui avait tranché la présente demande avait également jugé le même jour celle d'une des sœurs de Mme Rusznyak et d'autres membres de sa famille et leur avait reconnu la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention. Qui plus est, la demande d'asile d'une autre sœur et des membres de la famille de cette dernière avait déjà été accueillie par un autre commissaire.
[51]
La Commission a traité cette question de façon laconique et, à mon avis, déraisonnable:
Chaque demande d'asile est tranchée selon son bien-fondé, et il n'est pas possible de tirer des conclusions définitives qui pourraient s'appliquer à tous les membres d'une famille. Je ne suis pas lié par une autre décision que j'ai rendue ou par une décision rendue par un autre commissaire de la Commission.
[52]
Les demandeurs n'ont pas allégué que la Commission était « liée » par la décision de qui que ce soit. Ils ont simplement pensé que la suite qui avait été donnée à la demande de leurs sœurs qui étaient exposées aux mêmes problèmes en Hongrie constituait une preuve concernant les « personnes se trouvant dans une situation semblable » dont la Commission devait tenir compte.
[53]
Dans le cas qui nous occupe, cette façon de procéder rend problématique l'analyse de la protection de l'État de la Commission. Certes, il est vrai que, pour examiner la question de la protection de l'État, la Commission tient compte d'éléments de preuve portant sur la façon dont les demandeurs individuels ont cherché à obtenir la protection des autorités de l'État. Mais, dans le cas qui nous occupe, la conclusion tirée au sujet de la protection de l'État est proposée « à titre subsidiaire » à d'autres conclusions portant sur la crédibilité et se veut, en tout état de cause, une analyse très fouillée de la volonté et de la capacité de l'État hongrois de protéger ses citoyens roms selon la preuve documentaire. Il est par conséquent pour le moins étrange que le commissaire conclue qu'une des sœurs avait réfuté la présomption de l'existence d'une protection de l'État suffisante et que l'autre sœur n'avait pas réfuté cette présomption le même jour et sur le fondement de la même trousse d'information.
[54]
Le défendeur appelle mon attention sur le jugement
Jackson
(précité, aux paragraphes 39 et 40). Je ne crois toutefois pas que la juge Gagné était saisie, dans l'affaire
Jackson
, d'exactement de la même question que celle que je suis appelé à trancher en l'espèce. Il est admis que la Commission n'est pas liée par le résultat obtenu dans une autre demande d'asile, et ce, même lorsqu'il s'agit d'un parent, puisque la détermination du statut de réfugié se fait au cas par cas et qu'il est aussi possible que l'autre décision ait été erronée. La question à laquelle je dois répondre comporte toutefois une conclusion « subsidiaire » au sujet de l'État qui repose sur la même trousse d'information que le même commissaire a, le même jour, utilisée pour conclure que la présomption de protection de l'État avait été réfutée.
[55]
Ainsi que les demandeurs le soulignent, il existe de récentes décisions solides émanant de notre Cour qui confirment que les demandeurs ont droit à des explications détaillées des raisons pour lesquelles un certain commissaire qui avait examiné les mêmes documents portant sur les mêmes questions le même jour, pouvait arriver à une conclusion différente ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 17 à 19). Le juge Harrington a suivi le jugement <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> dans le jugement
Alexander
, précité:
[8] Bien que la norme de contrôle soit celle de la raisonnabilité
( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
)
et bien qu'il puisse y avoir plus d'une décision raisonnable, soit les personnes comme Mme Alexander peuvent obtenir la protection de l'État, soit elles ne le peuvent pas.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Phelan a examiné une décision dans laquelle il avait été décidé que le
MQM-A
du Pakistan était une organisation terroriste. Il y avait eu des décisions affirmant le contraire dans le passé. Je suis totalement d'accord avec lui lorsqu'il a écrit aux paragraphes 17 et 18:
[17] Il n'y a pas d'exigence légale stricte selon laquelle les commissaires doivent suivre les conclusions de fait d'un autre commissaire. C'est particulièrement vrai lorsque l'une des normes faisant appel au caractère « raisonnable » est en jeu: des personnes raisonnables peuvent raisonnablement être en désaccord.
[18] Ce qui nuit à la décision de la Commission c'est l'omission de s'exprimer sur les conclusions contradictoires de la décision
Memon
. Il se pourrait bien que le commissaire ne fût pas d'accord avec les conclusions de la décision
Memon
et il pourrait avoir de bonnes et solides raisons pour cela. Toutefois, le demandeur a droit, pour des raisons d'équité, à une décision complète, à une explication sur les raisons pour lesquelles le commissaire en cause, après avoir analysé les mêmes documents portant sur la même question, a pu parvenir à une conclusion différente.
[56]
Le juge Lagacé a également suivi le jugement <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> dans le jugement <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité:
[32] En l'espèce, un membre de la Section de l'immigration avait conclu précédemment que la carte d'identité nationale de M. Osagie était authentique. La Commission pouvait s'écarter de cette conclusion après avoir examiné la preuve, ce qu'elle a fait. Toutefois, vu l'existence de la décision antérieure, elle devait expliquer pourquoi elle s'écartait de la conclusion de la Section de l'immigration. Comme elle ne l'a pas fait, sa décision est discordante et arbitraire.
[57]
Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la Commission n'était pas liée par une décision antérieure, mais elle avait l'obligation d'examiner la question et d'expliquer pourquoi, malgré l'existence d'une trousse d'information identique, la protection de l'État ne pouvait être obtenue dans une autre affaire, mais l'était dans le cas des demandeurs. Ainsi que le juge Harrington l'explique, dans le jugement
Alexander
, précité, ou bien les intéressés pouvaient obtenir la protection de l'État, ou bien ils ne le pouvaient pas. À mon avis, le défaut de la Commission d'aborder cette question rend déraisonnable son analyse de la protection de l'État.
[58]
En conclusion, j'estime que la décision de la Commission était déraisonnable et qu'elle doit lui être renvoyée pour réexamen.
[59]
Les avocats ont convenu qu'il n'y avait aucune question à certifier et la Cour est du même avis.
