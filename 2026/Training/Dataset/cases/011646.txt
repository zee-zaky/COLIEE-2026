[1]
de Montigny, J.
: This is an application for judicial review under s 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 ("IRPA"), of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division ("IAD") of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated January 21, 2011, whereby the IAD ordered that the sponsorship appeal of the Applicant for his spouse and her children be dismissed.
[2]
Mr. Dhaliwal challenges the IAD decision on the grounds that his right to procedural fairness has been breached. More particularly, Mr. Dhaliwal argues that the interpretation at his IAD appeal hearing was so poor that it constituted a breach of natural justice. He also argues that the IAD should not have relied on the visa officer's computer notes of their interview without an affidavit to support them. Finally, he submits that the IAD should have permitted his witness, who had provided an affidavit, to testify.
[3]
Having carefully considered the record as well as the written and oral submissions of the parties, I have come to the conclusion that this application for judicial review ought to be dismissed. The following are my reasons.
BACKGROUND
[4]
The Applicant, Hardial Singh Dhaliwal, is 54 years old and was landed in Canada on April 1, 1999. He was previously married in February 1972 and divorced on October 20, 2006. The Applicant has four children from that marriage, aged 29 to 37 years old; he has no contact with them, and claims that his former spouse "poisoned" the children's mind and alienated them from him. Alleging feelings of loneliness and helplessness, he sought to remarry.
[5]
Mrs. Dhaliwal (formerly Karamjit Kaur) is a 45 year old citizen of India. Her first husband died in 1993. She has three children from that marriage, aged 27, 24 and 20. Her eldest son no longer resides with her, and is allegedly involved in terrorist activities.
[6]
The Applicant testified that the marriage was arranged by Sant Dharam Das, a religious teacher who is well known and trusted by both Mr. and Mrs. Dhaliwal. Sant Dharam Das talked to the Applicant about Mrs. Dhaliwal in 2007, and the Applicant flew to India, where he met her for the first time on February 2, 2008, in her village. They were married on February 14, 2008.
[7]
On July 16, 2009, Mr. and Mrs. Dhaliwal were interviewed separately by Visa Officer Keshub in New Delhi, India. The officer refused Mrs. Dhaliwal's application for a permanent resident visa on the same day. In the refusal letter, the following reasons were provided:
• The officer noted that their wedding photos showed a large gathering which is not the norm in their community for second marriages with partners who have grown children. The marriage was held in a city away from the usual place of residence of both the families.
• Mrs. Dhaliwal could not name Mr. Dhaliwal's native village. Most of the post-marriage photos were taken on the same day; were posed, and appeared to have been created to support the application. The officer was not satisfied that they had spent any time together after their marriage.
• Mrs. Dhaliwal said that after the marriage she has been residing with Mr. Dhaliwal's aunt in Faridkot. However, Mrs. Dhaliwal gave her first husband's native village of Langiana as her mailing address.
• The officer was not satisfied that Mr. and Mrs. Dhaliwal kept in touch after the marriage. The telephone bills could reflect calls to Mr. Dhaliwal's relatives in Faridkot, rather than calls to Mrs. Dhaliwal.
• The officer did not find it credible that Mrs. Dhaliwal would be marrying, now that one son was married and her children were grown, rather than 16 years ago when she had young children.
[8]
On September 8, 2009, Mr. Dhaliwal appealed the refusal to the IAD. At the hearing, the Applicant and his spouse required the services of an interpreter in giving their testimony.
THE IMPUGNED DECISION
[9]
The member based its negative determination of the genuineness and the intent of the parties as to their marriage, on a finding that there are significant implausibilities, discrepancies and inconsistencies in the evidence, which further contribute to undermine the credibility of both the Applicant and his wife. The member considered the following factors in making his decision:
•
The foundational documents of the sponsorship application and questionnaires
: Those documents are attested as true by the parties. Yet the parties showed indifference and neglect as to the accuracy or truthfulness of the information provided to immigration officials. While the Applicant and his wife have little formal education, illiteracy cannot be used as an excuse since Mrs. Dhaliwal's children are educated and could have assisted her.
•
The immigration officer's notes
: Counsel for the Applicant put forth that a limited weight should be placed on Mrs. Dhaliwal's interview. As per s 175(1)(c) of the
IRPA
, members can consider all credible and trustworthy evidence as a basis for a decision. Interview notes are generally considered to be credible and trustworthy.
•
The genesis of the relationship
: The Applicant did not explain why he so eagerly married Mrs. Dhaliwal considering her son's involvement in terrorist activities. The Applicant did not conduct any sort of investigation as to Mrs. Dhaliwal's past, prior to marrying her. Moreover, Mrs. Dhaliwal was also quick to agree to marry the Applicant, a man estranged from almost all of his close relatives.
•
Other implausibilities and discrepancies
:
o There are various discrepancies in their testimonies, namely the date of their first meeting, what family members of Mr. Dhaliwal his spouse met prior to the wedding, where Mrs. Dhaliwal's eldest son and family has been residing, the extent of financial support provided by Mr. Dhaliwal to his wife, details regarding Mr. Dhaliwal's work in 2009 and his current work, etc.
o The parties did not demonstrate the depth and extent of knowledge of each other and their circumstances, as would be expected in a genuine spousal relationship, given the extent of the alleged contact and communication.
o Several documents applied for and acquired after the marriage demonstrate an intention contrary to that of a long-lasting relationship. For example, the name of her late husband appeared on Mrs. Dhaliwal's passport, telephone bill, police clearance certificate and affidavit of birth.
[10]
On the basis of the evidence, the officer concluded that the marriage was entered into primarily for Mrs. Dhaliwal and two of her children to acquire permanent resident status in Canada.
ISSUES
[11]
The following issues arise in this application for judicial review:
a) Did the IAD breach the principle of natural justice in failing to provide adequate interpretation at the hearing?
b) Did the IAD err in relying on the visa officer's CAIPS notes because they were not supported by an affidavit?
c) Did the IAD breach the principle of natural justice in refusing to hear an additional witness?
ANALYSIS
[12]
It is well established that issues of procedural fairness are to be reviewed on a standard of correctness. In other words, a decision must usually be set aside when a breach of natural justice has occurred (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[13]
On the other hand, the weight to be given to the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System ("CAIPS") notes is a question of law falling within the expertise of the member. As such, it attracts a standard of reasonableness. Accordingly, the decision must be upheld if it falls "within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
a) Did the IAD breach the principle of natural justice in failing to provide adequate interpretation at the hearing?
[14]
Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Applicant was denied a fair hearing due to the failure of the IAD to ensure that the interpretation provided was competent. Relying on two affidavits by Mr. Sarb Sandhu, an interpreter who is regularly retained by the Tribunal, the Applicant maintains that there were material errors in the interpretation both from English to Punjabi and from Punjabi to English. These errors allegedly resulted in omissions, additions and misinterpretations during the testimony, and they could not be detected by the Applicant and his wife as they do not understand English.
[15]
I agree with counsel for the Respondent that Mr. Dhaliwal waived his right to object to the quality of interpretation at his hearing. It is well established that complaints about the quality of interpretation must be made at the earliest opportunity (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Failure to do so results in a waiver of the right to object to the interpretation on judicial review (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ no 1460 (QL)) .
[16]
It is true that neither Mr. Dhaliwal nor his spouse speaks English, thus making it difficult for them to raise concerns with the adequacy of the interpretation. But the Applicant was represented by a Punjabi speaking counsel, who took no issue with the calibre of interpretation at the IAD hearing. During Mr. Dhaliwal's five hour IAD hearing, counsel raised concerns six times about possible misinterpretations or words that may not have been clear or heard. Each concern was addressed by the interpreter or the IAD member, who asked the Applicant on multiple occasions to slow down, to repeat inaudible answers and to answer in segments to allow for accurate and complete interpretation. The member took every step to ensure that the interpretation was accurate, and counsel appeared to be satisfied that her concerns had been addressed. Never did she complain about the quality of interpretation at the hearing, in her lengthy written submissions to the IAD after the hearing or in her reply.
[17]
Having carefully reviewed the transcript of the hearing, I therefore come to the conclusion that the Applicant (through his counsel) must be taken to have waived his right to object to the quality of the interpretation. As Justice Pelletier said in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 25:
There is a powerful argument in favour of such a requirement arising from judicial economy. If applicants are permitted to obtain judicial review of adverse decisions by remaining silent in the face of known problems of interpretation, they will remain silent. This will result in a duplication of hearings. It seems a better policy to provide an incentive to make the original hearing as fair as possible and to avoid repetitious proceedings. Applicants should be required to complain at the first opportunity when it is reasonable to expect them to do so.
[18]
In any event, I find that the interpretation was adequate and that the alleged errors were immaterial. As the Supreme Court stated in
R v Tran
, [1994] 2 SCR 951, [1994] SCJ no 16 (QL) [
Tran
] although the standard of interpretation is high, it is not one of perfection. An interpreter auditing a hearing recording can always find instances of interpretation that are not perfect, as recognized by this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  95 ACWS (3d) 139 (FC). In order to meet the standard of continuous, precise, impartial and contemporaneous interpretation set out in
Tran
, above, however, the interpretation does not have to be perfect. What matters is that persons who do not speak and understand one of the official languages, be able to tell their story and that the interpretation be of such quality that they are not impeached in their ability to make their case (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ no 1082 (FC)).
[19]
In the case at bar, counsel for the Applicant relied on the affidavits of Mr. Sarb Sandhu. These affidavits, essentially to the same effect, are replete with arguments and conclusions on legal issues such as materiality, procedural fairness and credibility assessment. Since an affidavit should be limited to facts, pursuant to Rule 81(1) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106, these portions of the affidavits ought not to be considered by the Court.
[20]
Mr. Dhaliwal relied on the affidavits of Mr. Sandhu to show that the interpretation at his hearing was so inadequate that it constituted a breach of natural justice. Counsel for the Applicant made much of the fact that the Respondent did not tender any evidence to challenge or rebut the findings of Mr. Sandhu and did not cross-examine him. While this is certainly a factor that can be taken into consideration in assessing the evidence, it is always up to the trier of fact to assess the probative value of expert evidence, even where that evidence is uncontradicted (
R v Molodowic
, 2000 SCC 16 at paras 7-10, [2000] 1 SCR 420).
[21]
Having read the affidavits and the transcript, I see no proof of material errors justifying the Federal Court's intervention. If anything, the excerpts presented by Mr. Sandhu demonstrate that the interpreter was extremely cautious as she asked the spouse to repeat herself if she was not certain she had heard her correctly, and to slow down in order that the interpretation could be more accurate. Mr. Dhaliwal has not demonstrated that the interpretation negatively impacted the hearing. The Applicant and Mr. Sandhu may not have liked the interpreter's choice of words, but the interpretation conveyed the same message as Mr. Sandhu's own interpretation. As a result, I find that the interpretation was adequate and met the standard set by the Supreme Court in
Tran
, above.
b) Did the IAD err in relying on the visa officer's CAIPS notes because they were not supported by an affidavit?
[22]
Counsel for the Applicant further submitted that the IAD erred in relying on the visa officer's CAIPS notes, because they were not supported by an affidavit. Relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ no 1226 (QL) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2000] FCJ no 1450 (QL) counsel argued that CAIPS notes are no more than allegations of fact, and not evidence, when unsupported by an affidavit. Furthermore, it was contended that CAIPS notes are inherently unreliable as they are not a transcription of the interview, but rather notes of the immigration officer with regard to the interview.
[23]
This argument can be easily disposed of. First of all, the IAD is an administrative tribunal and, as such, is not bound by the rules of evidence governing this Court. Indeed, ss 175(a) and (b) of the
IRPA
explicitly states that the IAD "is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence", and allows it to base its decision on all evidence that "it considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances". The cases relied upon by the Applicant must therefore be distinguished, as they dealt with the use of CAIPS notes before this Court and not before the IAD.
[24]
The assessment of whether the CAIPS notes are credible or trustworthy is a matter to be determined by the IAD member, based on the evidence in each particular case. Mr. Dhaliwal's reliance on two IAD decisions does not assist his argument, as it is clear in both of those cases that weight was not given to the CAIPS notes for reasons that had nothing to do with their admissibility. In both of these cases, the IAD favoured the oral testimonies at the hearing over the CAIPS notes for a number of reasons that had more to do with the credibility of the appellant and his spouse than with technical formalities. In particular, the testimonies of the appellant and his wife were consistent and there was documentary evidence establishing the genuineness of the marriage. The IAD found that the visa officer's concerns had been adequately dealt with at the
de novo
hearing.
[25]
In the present case, the member found that there were contradictions between Mr. Dhaliwal's oral testimony and that of his wife, as well as with the documentary evidence. As already mentioned, the member noted the following: the lack of accuracy and truthfulness in the documentary evidence; discrepancies as to when and how the Applicant learned about the involvement of his spouse's son in terrorist activities; the lack of satisfactory explanation as to why the Applicant did not further investigate the circumstances of his spouse before the marriage; the lack of satisfactory explanation as to why the Applicant's spouse consented to marry someone who is estranged from most of his relatives; where his spouse's eldest son has been residing; where his spouse's family has been residing; the date of the Applicant and his spouse's first meeting; where the Applicant's spouse resided after the marriage; when the Applicant returned to Canada; and the extent of financial support provided by the Applicant to his spouse. Further, I note that Mr. Dhaliwal and his wife did not deny the statements contained in the visa officer's CAIPS notes of their interviews, or testify that the record of the interview was inaccurate. On that basis, the IAD member could reasonably conclude that the concerns of the visa officer were not dispelled before the IAD and that the CAIPS notes could be considered as credible and trustworthy.
c) Did the IAD breach the principle of natural justice in refusing to hear an additional witness?
[26]
Finally, counsel for the Applicant argued that the IAD erred in refusing to hear the testimony of Mr. Hardev Singh Dhaliwal, the Applicant's long-time friend and distant relative of his wife. Mr. Hardev Singh Dhaliwal had disclosed a summary of his intended
viva voce
evidence in an affidavit, and his intended evidence included personal knowledge of the relationship between the Applicant and his wife, of the genesis of the relationship and the on-going nature of it. In doing so, counsel submits that the IAD disallowed the Applicant from fairly prosecuting his appeal and sacrificed his appeal at the altar of administrative efficiency.
[27]
Once again, this argument must be rejected. The member was not required to hear all
viva voce
evidence. The IAD is to be shown much deference in its choice of procedure, provided that the Applicant is given adequate opportunity to be heard. The Applicant relied on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ no 45 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] in support of his claim that close family members and friends must be heard without any reservation when credibility is at issue. However, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, must be distinguished from the case at bar because it involved an unrepresented litigant, which imposes a higher degree of procedural fairness on the member. In the present case, the Applicant was fully represented by counsel. It was left to counsel for the Applicant to devise an efficient way to present his client's case given the allotted time for the hearing.
[28]
Both counsel were informed of the allotted time for the hearing almost two months before the hearing. At the outset of the hearing, the member noted that the hearing, as agreed, had been set for half a day, which meant that each party were to have an hour and a half to present their case. The member even mentioned that the Applicant could have requested more time in advance. Counsel for the Applicant answered that she did not require more time. In fact, Mr. Dhaliwal's hearing extended well over half a day, as it started at 9:00 a.m. and ended at 2:00 p.m. Moreover, the IAD member reminded counsel for the Applicant of the time and her responsibility to manage her witnesses during the hearing, assisted in focusing the questioning on relevant matters, and restricted the time for cross-examination by the Respondent's counsel. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the member was not open to hear all the testimonies, or that she sacrificed the fairness of the procedure on the altar of administrative expediency.
[29]
Be that as it may, it is not entirely clear what Mr. Hardev Singh Dhaliwal could have added in oral testimony to his affidavit. No further affidavit was filed in this Court as to what he could possibly have said. Moreover, the testimony of that witness would most probably have been immaterial, as the decision itself was based on contradictions between Mr. Dahliwal and his wife, and internal inconsistencies in the documents. Accordingly, I am unable to find that the IAD breached its duty of procedural fairness in refusing to allow Mr. Hardev Singh Dhaliwal to testify.
[30]
For all of the foregoing reasons, I have come to the conclusion that this application for judicial review must be dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[31]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed. The parties have not proposed a question of general importance, and none will be certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée conformément au paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, ch 27 (LIPR), d'une décision datée du 21 janvier 2011, par laquelle la Section d'appel de l'immigration (SAI), de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a rejeté l'appel interjeté par le demandeur au sujet du parrainage de son épouse et des enfants de cette dernière.
[2]
M. Dhaliwal conteste la décision de la SAI au motif qu'il a été privé de son droit à l'équité procédurale. En particulier, M. Dhaliwal soutient que les services d'interprétation dont il a bénéficié à l'audition de son appel étaient d'une qualité si médiocre que cela équivaut à un déni de justice naturelle. Il prétend aussi que la SAI n'aurait pas dû se fonder sur les notes informatiques prises par l'agent des visas durant l'entrevue puisqu'elles n'étaient pas accompagnées d'un affidavit. Enfin, il soutient que la SAI aurait dû accepter d'entendre son témoin, qui avait fourni un affidavit.
[3]
Ayant examiné soigneusement le dossier ainsi que les observations orales et écrites des parties, je conclus que la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée pour les motifs énoncés ci-dessous.
CONTEXTE
[4]
Le demandeur, Hardial Singh Dhaliwal, a 54 ans et a été admis au Canada le 1er avril 1999. Il s'est marié une première fois en février 1972 et a divorcé le 20 octobre 2006. Il a quatre enfants nés de ce mariage qui sont âgés de 29 à 37 ans; il n'a aucun contact avec eux, et il prétend que son ex-épouse leur a [traduction] « empoisonné » l'esprit et les a éloignés de lui. Prétendument parce qu'il se sentait seul et vulnérable, il a décidé se remarier.
[5]
Mme Dhaliwal (auparavant Karamjit Kaur) a 45 ans et est citoyenne de l'Inde. Son premier mari est décédé en 1993. Elle a trois enfants nés de ce mariage qui sont âgés de 27, 24 et 20 ans. Le fils aîné n'habite plus avec elle, et elle prétend qu'il est impliqué dans des activités terroristes.
[6]
Le demandeur a déclaré que le mariage a été arrangé par Sant Dharam Das, enseignant religieux bien connu, et digne de confiance selon les Dhaliwal. Sant Dharam Das a parlé de Mme Dhaliwal au demandeur en 2007; le demandeur s'est rendu en Inde où il a rencontré Mme Dhaliwal pour la première fois le 2 février 2008, dans son village. Ils se sont mariés le 14 février 2008.
[7]
Le 16 juillet 2009, M. et Mme Dhaliwal ont été interrogés séparément par un agent des visas, Keshub, à New Delhi (Inde). Le même jour, l'agent a refusé la demande de visa de résident permanent présentée par Mme Dhaliwal. On peut lire les motifs suivants dans la lettre de refus:
• L'agent a souligné que les photos de mariage montraient un grand rassemblement, ce qui n'est pas la coutume pour cette communauté lorsqu'il s'agit d'un deuxième mariage entre des partenaires qui ont des enfants adultes. Le mariage a été célébré dans une ville éloignée du lieu de résidence habituel des deux familles.
• Mme Dhaliwal n'a pu nommer le village natal de M. Dhaliwal. La plupart des photos postérieures au mariage ont été prises la même journée et semblent avoir été créées pour appuyer la demande. L'agent n'était pas convaincu que le couple avait passé du temps ensemble après le mariage.
• Mme Dhaliwal a déclaré qu'après le mariage, elle a habité à Faridkot, chez la tante de M. Dhaliwal. Mme Dhaliwal a pourtant donné Langiana comme adresse postale, soit le village natal de son premier mari.
• L'agent n'était pas convaincu que les Dhaliwal ont continué à communiquer après le mariage. Les factures téléphoniques pourraient refléter des appels que M. Dhaliwal a faits à des parents établis à Faridkot plutôt qu'à Mme Dhaliwal.
• L'agent n'a pas jugé vraisemblable que Mme Dhaliwal se marie maintenant, alors qu'un de ses fils est marié et que ses enfants sont adultes, plutôt qu'il y a 16 ans lorsque ses enfants étaient jeunes.
[8]
Le 8 septembre 2009, M. Dhaliwal a interjeté appel du refus à la SAI. À l'audition, le demandeur et son épouse ont eu besoin d'un interprète pour témoigner.
LA DÉCISION CONTESTÉE
[9]
La commissaire a tiré une conclusion défavorable à l'égard de l'authenticité du mariage et de l'intention des parties, ayant jugé que la preuve comportait des invraisemblances, des lacunes et des divergences importantes minant la crédibilité du demandeur et de son épouse. La commissaire a tenu compte des facteurs suivants pour rendre sa décision:
•
Les documents essentiels de la demande de parrainage et les questionnaires
: les parties ont certifié que ces documents étaient véridiques. Elles se sont pourtant montrées indifférentes et négligentes pour ce qui était de fournir des renseignements exacts et véridiques aux responsables de l'immigration. Le manque d'instruction du demandeur et de son épouse ne peut servir de prétexte puisque les enfants de Mme Dhaliwal, qui sont scolarisés, auraient pu l'aider.
•
Les notes de l'agent d'immigration
: l'avocate du demandeur a fait valoir qu'un poids limité doit être accordé à l'entrevue de Mme Dhaliwal. Aux termes de l'alinéa 175(1)
c
) de la LIPR, les commissaires peuvent fonder leur décision sur tous les éléments de preuve qu'ils jugent crédibles et dignes de foi. En général, les notes d'entrevue sont jugées crédibles et dignes de foi.
•
L'origine de la relation
: le demandeur n'a pas expliqué pourquoi il avait accepté si rapidement d'épouser Mme Dhaliwal compte tenu de l'implication du fils de cette dernière dans des activités terroristes. Le demandeur n'a fait aucune vérification du passé de Mme Dhaliwal avant de l'épouser. Mme Dhaliwal a, elle aussi, accepté rapidement de se marier avec le demandeur, un homme brouillé avec la plupart des membres de sa famille proche.
•
Autres invraisemblances et divergences
:
o Les témoignages comportent diverses divergences en ce qui concerne, notamment, la date de la première rencontre, les membres de la famille de M. Dhaliwal que son épouse a rencontrés avant le mariage, l'endroit où vivent le fils aîné de Mme Dhaliwal et sa famille, l'importance du soutien financier fourni par M. Dhaliwal à son épouse, les détails concernant le travail de M. Dhaliwal en 2009 et son emploi actuel, etc.
o Les parties n'ont pas démontré qu'elles avaient une vaste connaissance l'une de l'autre, comme on s'attendrait de retrouver dans une relation maritale authentique vu l'étendue du contact et de la communication allégués.
o Plusieurs documents qui ont été demandés et obtenus après le mariage laissent supposer que les parties n'ont pas l'intention d'entretenir une relation durable. Par exemple, le nom du défunt mari apparaît dans le passeport, les factures téléphoniques, le certificat de bonne conduite établi par la police et l'affidavit de naissance de Mme Dhaliwal.
[10]
À la lumière des éléments de preuve, l'agent a conclu que le mariage visait principalement l'acquisition de la résidence permanente au Canada pour Mme Dhaliwal et deux de ses enfants.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[11]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève les questions suivantes:
a) La SAI a-t-elle enfreint le principe de justice naturelle en n'offrant pas des services d'interprétation adéquats à l'audience?
b) La SAI a-t-elle commis une erreur en se fondant sur les notes versées dans le STIDI par l'agent étant donné qu'elles n'étaient pas corroborées par un affidavit?
c) La SAI a-t-elle enfreint le principe de justice naturelle en refusant d'entendre un témoin additionnel?
ANALYSE
[12]
Il est bien établi que les questions touchant à l'équité procédurale doivent être examinées selon la norme de la décision correcte. Autrement dit, la décision est habituellement annulée en cas de manquement à la justice naturelle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[13]
D'autre part, le poids qu'il convient d'accorder aux notes du Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration (STIDI) est une question de droit qui relève de l'expertise du commissaire et, à ce titre, commande la norme de la décision raisonnable. Ainsi, la décision sera maintenue si elle appartient « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47).
a) La SAI a-t-elle enfreint le principe de justice naturelle en n'offrant pas des services d'interprétation adéquats à l'audience?
[14]
L'avocate du demandeur soutient que celui-ci n'a pas eu droit à une audition équitable parce que la SAI ne s'est pas assurée de la qualité de l'interprétation. Se fondant sur deux affidavits de M. Sarb Sandhu, interprète dont le tribunal retient régulièrement les services, le demandeur maintient que des erreurs importantes sont survenues durant l'interprétation de l'anglais au pendjabi ainsi que du pendjabi à l'anglais. Ces erreurs auraient donné lieu à des omissions, à des ajouts et à des erreurs d'interprétation durant le témoignage, et le demandeur et son épouse n'ont pu les détecter étant donné qu'ils ne comprennent pas l'anglais.
[15]
Comme l'avocate du défendeur, je suis d'avis que M. Dhaliwal a renoncé à son droit de s'opposer à la qualité de l'interprétation en l'espèce. Il est bien établi que les plaintes portant sur la qualité de l'interprétation doivent être présentées à la première occasion (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 27). Par son abstention, le demandeur est présumé avoir renoncé à son droit de contester la qualité de l'interprétation au contrôle judiciaire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.F. no 1460 (QL), au paragraphe 31).
[16]
Il est vrai que M. Dhaliwal et son épouse ne parlent pas anglais, de sorte qu'il leur est difficile de soulever des doutes au sujet de la qualité de l'interprétation. Néanmoins, le demandeur était représenté par une conseil parlant le pendjabi, et celle-ci n'a pas contesté la qualité de l'interprétation fournie à l'audience devant la SAI. Durant l'audience de cinq heures, la conseil a, à six reprises, souligné d'éventuelles erreurs d'interprétation ou des mots qui n'auraient pas été prononcés clairement ou entendus. Chaque occurrence a été traitée par l'interprète ou la commissaire de la SAI, laquelle a demandé maintes fois au demandeur de ralentir, de répéter des réponses inaudibles et de répondre par segment pour qu'on puisse en faire une interprétation fidèle et complète. La commissaire a fait tout le nécessaire pour s'assurer que l'interprétation était exacte, et la conseil a semblé satisfaite de l'intervention du tribunal. Elle ne s'est jamais plainte de la qualité de l'interprétation à l'audience, ni dans les longues observations écrites qu'elle a présentées à la SAI après l'audience, ni encore dans sa réponse.
[17]
Ayant examiné soigneusement la transcription de l'audience, je dois conclure que le demandeur (par l'entremise de la conseil) est présumé avoir renoncé à son droit de contester la qualité de l'interprétation. Comme le juge Pelletier l'a déclaré dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 25:
L'économie des ressources judiciaires est un argument important à l'appui d'une telle exigence. Si les demandeurs peuvent obtenir le contrôle judiciaire des décisions qui leur donnent tort simplement en ne soulevant pas les problèmes patents d'interprétation, c'est ce qu'ils feront. Ceci mènera à une duplication des audiences. Il serait de meilleure politique d'encourager la tenue de l'audience la plus équitable possible et ainsi éviter des procédures à répétition. Les demandeurs devraient être tenus de se plaindre à la première occasion, lorsqu'il est raisonnable de s'y attendre.
[18]
Quoi qu'il en soit, j'estime que l'interprétation était adéquate et que les erreurs alléguées ne sont pas importantes. Comme l'a déclaré la Cour suprême dans
R c Tran
, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 951, [1994] A.C.S. no 16 (QL) [
Tran
], bien que la norme d'interprétation soit élevée, il ne s'agit pas d'une norme de perfection. L'interprète qui révise l'enregistrement d'une audience peut toujours trouver des exemples d'interprétation qui ne sont pas parfaits, tel que l'a reconnu la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  95 ACWS (3d) 139 (CF). Cependant, pour satisfaire à la norme établie dans
Tran
, précité, selon laquelle l'interprétation doit être continue, fidèle, impartiale et concomitante, l'interprétation n'a pas à être parfaite. Ce qui importe, c'est que la personne qui ne parle ni ne comprend l'une des langues officielles puisse raconter son histoire, et que la qualité de l'interprétation lui donne la possibilité de présenter ses arguments (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.F. no 1082 (CF), au paragraphe 26).
[19]
En l'espèce, l'avocate du demandeur s'est fondée sur les affidavits de M. Sarb Sandhu. Ces affidavits, d'une teneur essentiellement identique, sont remplis d'arguments et de conclusions sur des questions juridiques telles que le caractère substantiel, l'équité procédurale et l'évaluation de la crédibilité. Puisque l'affidavit doit se limiter aux faits, conformément au paragraphe 81(1) des
Règles des Cours fédérales
, DORS/98-106, la Cour n'a pas à tenir compte de ces portions des affidavits.
[20]
M. Dhaliwal se fonde sur les affidavits de M. Sandhu pour démontrer que l'interprétation fournie à l'audience était tellement inadéquate qu'elle constitue un déni de justice naturelle. L'avocate du demandeur a beaucoup insisté sur le fait que le défendeur n'avait produit aucun élément de preuve pour contester ou réfuter les conclusions de M. Sandhu et qu'il ne l'avait pas contre-interrogé. Il s'agit certes d'un facteur qui peut être pris en considération dans l'appréciation de la preuve, mais il appartient toujours au juge des faits d'établir la valeur probante de la preuve d'expert, même lorsque cette preuve n'est pas contredite (
R c Molodowic
, 2000 CSC 16, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 420, aux paragraphes 7 à 10).
[21]
Ayant lu les affidavits et la transcription, je n'y trouve aucune preuve d'erreurs importantes justifiant l'intervention de la Cour fédérale. Je dirais même que les extraits présentés par M. Sandhu montrent que l'interprète a été extrêmement prudente, demandant à l'épouse de répéter lorsqu'elle n'était pas certaine d'avoir bien entendu et de ralentir pour que l'interprétation soit plus fidèle. M. Dhaliwal n'a pas établi que l'interprétation avait nui à l'audience. Le demandeur et M. Sandhu n'ont peut-être pas aimé le choix de mots de l'interprète, mais l'interprétation a transmis le même message que la propre interprétation de M. Sandhu. Par conséquent, j'estime que l'interprétation était adéquate et conforme à la norme établie par la Cour suprême dans
Tran
, précité.
b) La SAI a-t-elle commis une erreur en se fondant sur les notes versées dans le STIDI par l'agent étant donné qu'elles n'étaient pas corroborées par un affidavit?
[22]
L'avocate du demandeur soutient en outre que la SAI a commis une erreur en se fondant sur les notes versées dans le STIDI par l'agent des visas, parce qu'elles n'étaient pas accompagnées d'un affidavit. Invoquant les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] A.C.F. no 226 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2000] A.C.F. no 1450 (QL), l'avocate prétend que les notes du STIDI ne sont rien de plus que des allégations de fait, et non des éléments de preuve, lorsqu'elles ne sont pas étayées par un affidavit. Elle affirme par ailleurs que les notes du STIDI ne sont pas fiables, de par leur nature, puisqu'il s'agit non pas d'une transcription de l'entrevue, mais bien de notes prises par l'agent d'immigration au sujet de l'entrevue.
[23]
Cet argument peut être facilement écarté. Premièrement, la SAI est un tribunal administratif et, à ce titre, n'est pas astreinte aux règles de preuve régissant la Cour. En effet, les alinéas 175
b
) et
c
) de la LIPR prévoient explicitement que la SAI « n'est pas liée par les règles légales ou techniques de présentation de la preuve » et qu'elle peut fonder sa décision sur tous les éléments de preuve « qu'elle juge crédibles ou dignes de foi en l'occurrence ». Les décisions invoquées par le demandeur ne peuvent donc s'appliquer, car elles traitent de l'utilisation des notes du STIDI devant la présente instance et non devant la SAI.
[24]
La question de savoir si les notes du STIDI sont crédibles ou dignes de foi est une question que le commissaire de la SAI doit trancher à la lumière de la preuve existant dans chaque cas particulier. Le recours de M. Dhaliwal à deux décisions de la SAI ne prête aucune force à son argument puisqu'il est évident, dans les deux cas, qu'aucun poids n'a été accordé aux notes du STIDI pour des motifs n'ayant rien à voir avec leur recevabilité. Dans ces deux affaires, la SAI a préféré les témoignages présentés à l'audience aux notes du STIDI, et ce, pour un certain nombre de raisons qui concernaient davantage la crédibilité de l'appelant et de son épouse que des formalités techniques. En particulier, les témoignages des deux intéressés étaient concordants, et des documents déposés en preuve établissaient l'authenticité du mariage. La SAI a conclu que la nouvelle audience avait permis de dissiper les doutes de l'agent des visas.
[25]
En l'espèce, la commissaire a jugé qu'il y avait des contradictions entre les témoignages de M. Dhaliwal et de son épouse, ainsi que par rapport à la preuve documentaire. Tel qu'il a déjà été mentionné, la commissaire a souligné les problèmes suivants: le manque d'exactitude et de véracité de la preuve documentaire; les divergences quant au moment et à la façon dont le demandeur a été mis au courant de l'implication du fils de son épouse dans des activités terroristes; l'absence d'explications satisfaisantes quant à savoir pourquoi le demandeur s'est peu informé sur la situation de son épouse avant le mariage; l'absence d'explications satisfaisantes à savoir pourquoi l'épouse du demandeur a accepté d'épouser une personne qui est brouillée avec la plupart des membres de sa famille proche; l'endroit où vit le fils aîné de son épouse; l'endroit où vit la famille de son épouse; la date de la première rencontre entre le demandeur et son épouse; l'endroit où l'épouse du demandeur a résidé après le mariage; quand le demandeur est revenu au Canada; l'importance du soutien financier fourni par le demandeur à son épouse. En outre, je souligne que M. Dhaliwal et son épouse n'ont pas nié les déclarations contenues dans les notes d'entrevue que l'agent des visas a versées dans le STIDI et n'ont pas déclaré que le dossier de l'entrevue était inexact. Partant, la commissaire était en droit de conclure que les doutes de l'agent des visas n'avaient pas été dissipés devant la SAI et que les notes du STIDI pouvaient être jugées crédibles et dignes de foi.
c) La SAI a-t-elle enfreint le principe de justice naturelle en refusant d'entendre un témoin additionnel?
[26]
Enfin, l'avocate du demandeur prétend que la SAI a commis une erreur en refusant d'entendre le témoignage de M. Hardev Singh Dhaliwal, ami de longue date du demandeur et parent éloigné de son épouse. M. Hardev Singh Dhaliwal avait transmis un affidavit résumant le témoignage qu'il prévoyait faire, qui portait notamment sur sa connaissance personnelle de la relation entre le demandeur et son épouse, de l'origine de la relation et de sa durabilité. L'avocate maintient que la SAI a donc privé le demandeur de son droit à une audition équitable et sacrifié son appel au profit de l'efficience administrative.
[27]
Ici encore, je dois rejeter cet argument. La commissaire n'était pas tenue d'entendre tous les témoignages oraux. Il convient de faire preuve d'une grande retenue face au choix de procédure de la SAI, pour autant que le demandeur a une possibilité adéquate d'être entendu. Le demandeur a invoqué la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] A.C.F. no 45 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] pour appuyer son allégation selon laquelle les amis et parents proches doivent être entendus sans hésitation lorsque la crédibilité est mise en doute. Il convient toutefois de distinguer la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, de la présente affaire parce qu'elle concerne une partie non représentée, ce qui astreignait le commissaire à une norme d'équité procédurale plus élevée. Dans le cas présent, le demandeur a été dûment représenté par une avocate. Il appartenait à celle-ci de trouver une façon efficace de présenter les arguments de son client dans le temps d'audience alloué.
[28]
Les deux avocates ont été avisées du temps alloué presque deux mois avant l'audience. Au début de la séance, la commissaire a souligné que l'audience, comme convenu, avait été fixée à une demi-journée, laissant ainsi à chaque partie une heure et demie pour présenter ses arguments. La commissaire a même précisé que le demandeur aurait pu obtenir plus de temps s'il en avait fait la demande à l'avance. L'avocate du demandeur a répondu qu'elle n'avait pas besoin de temps supplémentaire. En fait, l'audience de M. Dhaliwal s'est prolongée bien au-delà d'une demi-journée, puisqu'elle a débuté à 9 h et s'est terminée à 14 h. De plus, la commissaire a indiqué l'heure à l'avocate du demandeur et lui a rappelé qu'elle avait la responsabilité de gérer ses témoins durant l'audience, l'a aidée à orienter les questions sur les points pertinents et a réduit le temps alloué au contre-interrogatoire de l'avocate du défendeur. Par conséquent, il ne peut être dit que la commissaire n'était pas disposée à entendre tous les témoignages ni qu'elle a sacrifié l'équité de la procédure au profit de l'efficience administrative.
[29]
Quoi qu'il en soit, il n'est pas parfaitement clair que M. Hardev Singh Dhaliwal aurait pu, par son témoignage, ajouter quoi que ce soit à son affidavit. Aucun autre affidavit n'a été présenté à la Cour sur ce qu'il aurait pu dire. De plus, la déposition de ce témoin aurait plus que probablement été sans importance, car la décision même était fondée sur les déclarations contradictoires faites par M. Dhaliwal et son épouse, ainsi que sur les divergences présentes dans les documents. Par conséquent, il m'est impossible de conclure que la SAI a manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en refusant d'autoriser M. Hardev Singh Dhaliwal à témoigner.
[30]
Pour l'ensemble des raisons susmentionnées, je conclus que la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée.
JUGEMENT
