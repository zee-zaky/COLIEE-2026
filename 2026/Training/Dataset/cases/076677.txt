Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Harrington, J.
: Mr. Jalal cannot accept that he was eliminated from a selection process competition for up to nine new positions within the Federal Public Service. He did not make it into the staffing pool. He believes he was better than the seven candidates who were appointed from that pool. Ostensibly, the selection panel eliminated him from the competition on the basis that he failed three questions in the oral interview. His belief, however, is that he was failed because he is a member of a visible minority, and because the candidates who were selected were "white". More particularly, the first candidate chosen was favoured because she is francophone.
[2]
Mr. Jalal complained to the Public Service Staffing Tribunal that there was abuse of authority in the application of merit and in the choice of process. Following a number of pre-hearing decisions and conferences, the complaint was heard, and dismissed, by John A. Mooney, vice-chairman of the Tribunal. This is a judicial review of that decision.
DECISION
[3]
Mr. Jalal's application for judicial review shall be dismissed with costs. Contrary to his submissions, he was given a fair hearing. There was no reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the examiners or the Tribunal. Mr. Mooney's decision is eminently reasonable. As he explained clearly, his duty was not to remark the exams but rather simply to determine whether Mr. Jalal had been rejected because of an abuse of authority or adverse discrimination due to race or ethnic origin. His conclusion that such was not the case was well motivated and should not be set aside.
FACTS
[4]
By way of a Public Service Staffing Advertisement limited to employees in the Public Service within the National Capital Region, the Department of Human Resources and Social Development - Learning Branch advertised for the position of "Advisor", classified as PM-05, AS-05. It was anticipated that up to nine positions would be filled soon, or in the future.
[5]
The accompanying Statement of Merit Criteria & Conditions of Employment set out 15 essential qualifications including "ability to lead teams, ability to analyze issues and provide recommendations, advice and guidance" and "ability to work effectively under the pressure of deadlines and large workloads."
[6]
The selection panel comprised nine members. They determined that qualifications would be assessed through the candidates'
curriculum vitae
, a written exam, reference checks and an interview.
[7]
Mr. Jalal succeeded in the written exam, and his cv and reference checks do not appear to be in issue. However, the selection board determined that he failed the oral interview (exam) with respect to the three essential qualifications referred to above.
[8]
On 15 June 2009, Human Resources emailed Mr. Jalal to say: "We regret to inform you that your candidacy cannot be given further consideration in this selection process as you did not obtain the pass mark for one or more of the essential qualifications." He was not satisfied with a post-board meeting and so on 10 July 2009 filed a complaint on the Public Service Staffing Tribunal complaint form. He was not aware that at that time one appointment had already been made. His complaint was originally directed to the fact that he did not get into the pool.
THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS
[9]
The complaint was filed with reference to s. 77 of the
Public Service Employment Act
. Subsection 77(1) reads as follows:
77. (1) When the Commission has made or proposed an appointment in an internal appointment process, a person in the area of recourse referred to in subsection (2) may - in the manner and within the period provided by the Tribunal's regulations - make a complaint to the Tribunal that he or she was not appointed or proposed for appointment by reason of
(a) an abuse of authority by the Commission or the deputy head in the exercise of its or his or her authority under subsection 30(2);
(b) an abuse of authority by the Commission in choosing between an advertised and a non-advertised internal appointment process; or
(c) the failure of the Commission to assess the complainant in the official language of his or her choice as required by subsection 37(1).
77. (1) Lorsque la Commission a fait une proposition de nomination ou une nomination dans le cadre d'un processus de nomination interne, la personne qui est dans la zone de recours visée au paragraphe (2) peut, selon les modalités et dans le délai fixés par règlement du Tribunal, présenter à celui-ci une plainte selon laquelle elle n'a pas été nommée ou fait l'objet d'une proposition de nomination pour l'une ou l'autre des raisons suivantes:
a) abus de pouvoir de la part de la Commission ou de l'administrateur général dans l'exercice de leurs attributions respectives au titre du paragraphe 30(2);
b) abus de pouvoir de la part de la Commission du fait qu'elle a choisi un processus de nomination interne annoncé ou non annoncé, selon le cas;
c) omission de la part de la Commission d'évaluer le plaignant dans la langue officielle de son choix, en contravention du paragraphe 37(1).
[10]
It is a condition precedent within s. 77 that one cannot complain until the Public Service Commission has made or proposed an appointment. Then, and only then, may a person in Mr. Jalal's position make a complaint to the Tribunal that he was not appointed or proposed for appointment. Mr. Jalal had standing under s. 77(2) and s. 34 in that he was an unsuccessful candidate in an advertised internal appointment process. The issue whether Mr. Jalal had another recourse because his name was not entered in the pool is not before me.
[11]
Mr. Jalal's complaint led to some confusion as it did not conform to the
Public Service Staffing Tribunal Regulations
. In accordance with sections 10 and 11 thereof, the complaint must be received by the Tribunal no later than 15 days after the complainant receives notice of the appointment or the proposed appointment, to which must be attached copy of the said appointment or proposed appointment. The reason for this is that the person appointed becomes a party to the process and has the right to defend himself or, in this case, herself.
[12]
As a result, some email correspondence was generated between the Tribunal Registry and Human Resources, as the latter could not identify the person against whom the complaint was levied. Mr. Jalal then came up with a name, but she had been appointed more than 15 days after his complaint. Fortuitously, it turns out that one Sandra Langlois had been appointed within the 15-day window, and so the complaint was treated as being directed against her.
[13]
Mr. Jalal has taken the position that his complaint was directed against all seven appointees, some of whom were only appointed the year following his complaint. He submits that the Tribunal was inconsistent in that it allowed for the production of the exam results of all seven successful candidates, but then ruled on the merits that the complaint was deemed to have only been directed against Ms. Langlois. Mr. Jalal's logic is faulty. At a preliminary stage, such as production of documents, one may well allow discovery which might lead to a chain of inquiry. It does not follow that all these documents will be held to be relevant when the final decision is rendered.
[14]
Mr. Mooney acted both reasonably and correctly in limiting the complaint to the successful candidature of Ms. Langlois.
ISSUES
[15]
In its reasons for decision, the Tribunal described the issues before it as follows:
36 The Tribunal must decide the following issues:
(i) Did the respondent abuse its authority in the assessment of the complainant's qualifications?
(ii) Did the respondent discriminate against the complainant because of his race or ethnic origin?
(iii) Did the respondent breach departmental policies and provide misleading information in the assessment guide?
(iv) Was Ms. Ducharme sufficiently fluent in English to assess the complainant's qualifications?
(v) Did the respondent show personal favouritism towards Ms. Langlois because she is francophone?
[16]
In his application record, Mr. Jalal described the issues in this judicial review as follows:
The PSST has:
• ruled on irrelevant issues and has considered primarily irrelevant factors;
• based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact without regard for the material and evidence before it;
• contradicted its own regulations and acted arbitrarily in exercising its discretion;
• conducted questionable hearing process;
• rejected to consider the crucial evidence provided by the applicant;
• favoured and ruled on the respondent's misleading and incorrect information; and
• the applicant did not get a chance to make his case (he and his representative were repeatedly cut off by the respondent's counsel during the hearing). Further, the applicant was denied the opportunity to question the respondent's witnesses involved in appointees' assessments.
[17]
Put another way, Mr. Jalal submits that the Tribunal erred in law, made palpable and overriding errors in its finding of fact and acted in a procedurally unfair manner.
PROCEDURAL UNFAIRNESS
[18]
Mr. Jalal was entitled to procedural fairness. He was entitled to have a fair opportunity to make his case. On these issues, the Tribunal is not entitled to deference (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2013] SCJ No 28 (QL)).
[19]
Mr. Jalal's complaints in this area are myriad.
[20]
He complains that Human Resources and the Tribunal were talking behind his back in the form of an exchange of emails. This exchange was generated by the fact that the Registry was required to pass the complaint on to the employer. The employer naturally asked the identity of the person against whom the complaint was directed. This led to the Registry communicating with Mr. Jalal. This was purely administrative, and in no way unfair.
[21]
There were nine members of the selection panel. The employer stated at a pre-hearing conference that it was only going to call as witnesses the two individuals who had administered the oral exam to Mr. Jalal. He, and his union representative, could have subpoenaed the other seven, but did not.
[22]
Mr. Jalal complains that witnesses were not excluded from the hearing .This allowed for collusion and perjury. It was not up to the Tribunal to exclude witnesses. Mr. Jalal and his representative could have moved for exclusion. His allegation of perjury is completely without merit.
[23]
He complains that his union representative was constantly interrupted. Yet there is no complaint from her.
[24]
Important evidence was excluded. The hearing had been set down for two days. Although evidence was closed, there was not sufficient time for oral argument. Consequently, it was agreed that submissions be made in writing. Mr. Jalal took advantage of this to, in effect, lead further testimony. Mr. Mooney quite rightly discounted this evidence. For instance, Mr. Jalal said that the notes taken by the examiners during his oral exam were incomplete. It was open to him to make that statement during his testimony so as to give the two examiners, who were witnesses, an opportunity to respond. Material and "testimony" received after the hearing could have been produced earlier. Mr. Mooney properly exercised his discretion in his exclusionary order.
[25]
Mr. Jalal also complains about his representative. At the beginning of the hearing, she withdrew his complaint that the appointments violated Mr. Jalal's Charter rights. He said she was not so authorized. However, the discrimination provisions of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
did form part of the hearing. The Charter would not have added anything.
[26]
Mr. Jalal takes the position that some of the issues set up by Mr. Mooney were irrelevant and not before him. I find it impossible to make that determination. His final written argument before the Tribunal, which he wrote, rather than his union representative, runs some 169 paragraphs and then his later response ran 30 pages. His application for judicial review is accompanied by a 100-paragraph affidavit, and his memorandum of fact and law runs 129 paragraphs. Mr. Mooney did not act unreasonably in characterizing the issues as he did. In this judicial review, Mr. Jalal did not pursue his allegations that one of the examiners was not sufficiently conversant with the English language to appreciate his answers in the oral exam and that Ms. Langlois was favoured as she is a francophone. However, those allegations were before the Tribunal.
[27]
I conclude that Mr. Jalal was given a fair hearing.
REASONABLE APPREHENSION OF BIAS
[28]
Turning now to another aspect of natural justice, the alleged apprehension of bias, Mr. Jalal has submitted an analysis of the exam results of the seven appointees, as well as his own, both with respect to the written exam, which is irrelevant since he passed, and the interview. He concluded:
After having reviewed and compared my examples re: questions A1, A3 and A4, with all the appointees' answers, particularly, with candidates:
#2, #3, #4
and
#5
, it is crystal clear that my answers were much
stronger
and appropriate than most of these appointees. I believe that if a reasonably informed bystander were to compare my examples with the examples of the seven appointees, he would most likely perceive bias on part of the selection board.
[29]
Mr. Jalal was actually asking the Tribunal to redo his assessment. That was not its function, and is not the function of this Court. The Tribunal was to determine whether Mr. Jalal's marks, and the marks of others, gave any credence to his allegation of bias or abuse. Perhaps another selection panel would have scored Mr. Jalal higher, perhaps not. That is not the issue. The issue is whether is it was reasonable for the Tribunal to conclude that there was no evidence of an apprehension of bias. As stated by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in
Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 394:
[...] the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is "what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude.
[30]
In my opinion, there is nothing in the record to support Mr. Jalal's speculation that the selection panel was biased and selected another out of favouritism, or that Mr. Mooney, the vice-chair of the Tribunal, was likewise so infected.
THE TRIBUNAL'S FINDINGS - ERRORS IN FACT AND LAW
[31]
Mr. Jalal submits that alleged errors of law, and I have found none, should be assessed on a correctness standard. He submits that Mr. Mooney was not dealing with his home statute because others also deal with it and in considering the
Canadian Human Rights Act
was not dealing with a closely related statute. This cannot be so as the Tribunal is specifically directed to consider adverse discrimination within the meaning of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. In any event, the standard of review is not in issue. There were no pure questions of law. At most, there were mixed questions of fact and law and findings of fact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2008] SCJ No 9 (QL), both matters have been assessed on a reasonableness standard.
[32]
As a matter of fact and law, Mr. Jalal was required to give the Canadian Human Rights Commission notice so as to allow it to participate in the hearing if it so chose. He gave that notice but the Commission declined to participate.
[33]
As stated by the Supreme Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47:
Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result. Instead, they may give rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions. Tribunals have a margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions. A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[34]
As Mr. Justice Iacobucci warned us in
Canada (Director of Investigation and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 80:
I wish to observe, by way of concluding my discussion of this issue, that a reviewer, and even one who has embarked upon review on a standard of reasonableness
simpliciter
, will often be tempted to find some way to intervene when the reviewer him- or herself would have come to a conclusion opposite to the tribunal's. Appellate courts must resist such temptations. My statement that I might not have come to the same conclusion as the Tribunal should not be taken as an invitation to appellate courts to intervene in cases such as this one but rather as a caution against such intervention and a call for restraint. Judicial restraint is needed if a cohesive, rational, and, I believe, sensible system of judicial review is to be fashioned.
[35]
I accept, without need for further comment, that the Tribunal made a proper assessment in determining that the employer had not contradicted its own regulations.
[36]
Mr. Jalal has seized upon every possible imperfection in the process. As Mr. Justice Joyal noted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL):
It is true that artful pleaders can find any number of errors when dealing with decisions of administrative tribunals. Yet we must always remind ourselves of what the Supreme Court of Canada said on a criminal appeal where the grounds for appeal were some 12 errors in the judge's charge to the jury. In rendering judgment, the Court stated that it had found 18 errors in the judge's charge, but that in the absence of any miscarriage of justice, the appeal could not succeed.
[...] There can always be conflict on the evidence. There is always the possibility of an opposite decision from a differently constituted Board. Anyone might have reached a different conclusion. Different conclusions may often be reached if one perhaps subscribes to different value systems. But in spite of counsel for the applicant's thorough exposition, I have failed to grasp forcefully the kind of error in the Board's decision which would justify my intervention. The Board's decision, in my view, is fully consistent with the evidence.
COSTS
[37]
There is no reason why costs should not follow the event. The employer was put to considerable effort in defending this application. The Minister suggests lump sum costs, all inclusive, of $3,500. In its discretion, this Court is entitled to grant costs on a lump sum basis. Indeed, this approach is preferred as it saves both parties detailed calculations and attendance before a taxing officer. However, a rough and ready calculation should not exceed Tariff B. Based on Column III of Tariff B, I calculate taxable fees of 17 units at $140 per unit, or $2,380. As well, there are necessary disbursements. I fix taxable costs and disbursements at $2,750, inclusive of all taxes, being confident that if taxed, the assessment would be greater than that.
ORDER
[38]
FOR REASONS GIVEN;
THIS COURT ORDERS that
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed, with costs in the amount of $2,750, all inclusive.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Harrington
[Traduction]: M. Jalal n'accepte pas son élimination du processus de sélection d'un concours qui visait à pourvoir jusqu'à neuf postes au sein de la fonction publique fédérale. Il estime être plus qualifié que les sept personnes nommées à partir du bassin de dotation dont il a été exclu. Le jury de sélection l'aurait éliminé du concours soi-disant parce qu'il n'a pas su répondre convenablement à trois questions à l'entrevue. Il croit cependant que sa candidature a été rejetée parce qu'il appartient à une minorité visible et que les postulants dont la candidature a été retenue étaient « blancs ». Il fait par ailleurs observer que la première candidate retenue aurait été favorisée parce qu'elle était francophone.
[2]
M. Jalal a adressé une plainte au Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique en invoquant un abus de pouvoir dans l'application du principe du mérite et dans le choix du processus. Après un certain nombre de décisions et de conférences préalables à l'audience, la plainte a été instruite et rejetée par John A. Mooney, vice-président du Tribunal. Il s'agit en l'espèce du contrôle judiciaire de cette décision.
DÉCISION
[3]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire de M. Jalal sera rejetée avec dépens. Contrairement à ce qu'il fait valoir, il a bénéficié d'une audience équitable. Aucune crainte raisonnable de partialité de la part des enquêteurs ou du Tribunal n'est justifiée. La décision de M. Mooney est tout à fait raisonnable. Comme il l'a clairement expliqué, sa tâche ne consistait pas à réévaluer les examens, mais simplement à déterminer si la candidature de M. Jalal avait été rejetée à cause d'un abus de pouvoir ou d'une discrimination préjudiciable liée à sa race ou à son origine ethnique. Sa conclusion à l'effet inverse reposait sur des motifs convenables et ne devrait pas être écartée.
FAITS
[4]
La Direction générale de l'apprentissage du ministère des Ressources humaines et Développement social a annoncé le poste de « conseiller » classifié au niveau PM-05, AS-05, au moyen d'une annonce de dotation de la fonction publique s'adressant exclusivement aux fonctionnaires de la région de la Capitale nationale. Il était prévu qu'un maximum de neuf postes soient pourvus rapidement ou dans le futur.
[5]
L'énoncé des critères de mérite et conditions d'emploi relatif à cette annonce faisait état de quinze qualifications essentielles, incluant [traduction] « capacité de diriger des équipes, capacité d'analyser des problèmes et de formuler des recommandations, des avis et des directives », et [traduction] « capacité de travailler efficacement sous la pression qu'occasionnent les délais et un volume de travail élevé ».
[6]
Le jury de sélection était composé de neuf membres, qui ont décidé d'évaluer les qualifications sur la base du curriculum vitæ des candidats, d'un examen écrit, d'une vérification des références et d'une entrevue.
[7]
M. Jalal a réussi l'examen écrit; son CV et la vérification de ses références ne semblent pas avoir posé problème. Cependant, le jury de sélection a conclu qu'il avait échoué l'entrevue orale (examen) au regard des trois qualifications essentielles susmentionnées.
[8]
Le 15 juin 2009, les Ressources humaines ont annoncé ce qui suit par courriel à M. Jalal: [traduction] « Nous avons le regret de vous informer que votre candidature ne peut plus être considérée dans le cadre de ce processus de sélection étant donné que vous n'avez pas obtenu la note de passage à l'égard d'au moins une qualification essentielle. » M. Jalal, qui a eu un entretien postérieur à la sélection qui ne lui a pas donné satisfaction, a déposé, le 10 juillet 2009, une plainte devant le Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique. Il ignorait alors qu'une nomination avait déjà eu lieu. L'objet initial de sa plainte était son exclusion du bassin de dotation.
LA PROCÉDURE DE RÈGLEMENT DES GRIEFS
[9]
La plainte a été déposée en vertu de l'article 77 de la
Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique
. Le paragraphe (1) de cette disposition est libellé comme suit:
77. (1) Lorsque la Commission a fait une proposition de nomination ou une nomination dans le cadre d'un processus de nomination interne, la personne qui est dans la zone de recours visée au paragraphe (2) peut, selon les modalités et dans le délai fixés par règlement du Tribunal, présenter à celui-ci une plainte selon laquelle elle n'a pas été nommée ou fait l'objet d'une proposition de nomination pour l'une ou l'autre des raisons suivantes:
a) abus de pouvoir de la part de la Commission ou de l'administrateur général dans l'exercice de leurs attributions respectives au titre du paragraphe 30(2);
b) abus de pouvoir de la part de la Commission du fait qu'elle a choisi un processus de nomination interne annoncé ou non annoncé, selon le cas;
c) omission de la part de la Commission d'évaluer le plaignant dans la langue officielle de son choix, en contravention du paragraphe 37(1).
77. (1) When the Commission has made or proposed an appointment in an internal appointment process, a person in the area of recourse referred to in subsection (2) may - in the manner and within the period provided by the Tribunal's regulations - make a complaint to the Tribunal that he or she was not appointed or proposed for appointment by reason of
(
a
) an abuse of authority by the Commission or the deputy head in the exercise of its or his or her authority under subsection 30(2);
(
b
) an abuse of authority by the Commission in choosing between an advertised and a non-advertised internal appointment process; or
(
c
) the failure of the Commission to assess the complainant in the official language of his or her choice as required by subsection 37(1).
[10]
L'article 77 prévoit une condition préalable: la plainte ne peut être présentée que lorsque la Commission de la fonction publique a fait une proposition de nomination ou une nomination. Ce n'est qu'alors qu'une personne dans la situation de M. Jalal peut adresser une plainte au Tribunal au motif qu'elle n'a pas été nommée ni fait l'objet d'une proposition de nomination. M. Jalal avait qualité pour agir en vertu du paragraphe 77(2) et de l'article 34 en ce que sa candidature n'a pas été retenue dans le cadre d'un processus de nomination interne annoncé. Je ne suis pas saisi de la question de savoir s'il disposait d'un autre recours avant d'être exclu du bassin de dotation.
[11]
La plainte de M. Jalal a suscité une certaine confusion, car elle n'était pas conforme au
Règlement du Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique
. En effet, les articles 10 et 11 de ce règlement prévoient que la plainte doit être reçue par le Tribunal dans les quinze jours suivant la date à laquelle le plaignant reçoit avis de la nomination ou de la proposition de nomination et qu'une copie de ladite nomination ou proposition de nomination doit être jointe à la plainte. Ces formalités s'expliquent par le fait que la personne nommée devient partie au processus et qu'elle a le droit de se défendre.
[12]
Par la suite, il y a eu un échange de quelques courriels entre le greffe du Tribunal et les Ressources humaines, car celles-ci n'ont pas été en mesure d'identifier la personne visée par la plainte. M. Jalal a donc fourni le nom d'une personne, mais cette dernière n'a été nommée pour pourvoir un poste que plus de quinze jours après le dépôt de sa plainte. Heureusement pour M. Jalal, une certaine Sandra Langlois avait été nommée durant ce délai de quinze jours, et la plainte a donc été traitée comme si elle était dirigée contre elle.
[13]
M. Jalal a fait valoir que sa plainte visait en fait les sept personnes engagées, dont certaines n'ont été nommées que l'année suivant le dépôt de sa plainte. Il soutient que le Tribunal s'est montré incohérent en autorisant la production des résultats d'examen des sept candidats reçus, mais en concluant sur le fond que la plainte n'était censée viser que Mme Langlois. La logique de M. Jalal est défaillante. À un stade préliminaire, comme celui de la production de documents, on peut très bien autoriser la communication de pièces susceptibles de permettre de mener une série de vérifications. Il ne s'ensuit pas que tous ces documents seront considérés comme pertinents lorsque la décision définitive sera rendue.
[14]
La décision de M. Mooney de limiter la plainte à la candidature retenue de Mme Langlois était à la fois raisonnable et correcte.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[15]
Dans les motifs de sa décision, le Tribunal a formulé ainsi les questions dont il était saisi:
36 Le Tribunal doit trancher les questions suivantes:
(i) L'intimé a-t-il abusé de son pouvoir dans son évaluation des qualifications du plaignant?
(ii) L'intimé a-t-il fait preuve de discrimination à l'endroit du plaignant en raison de sa race ou de son origine ethnique?
(iii) L'intimé a-t-il enfreint les politiques ministérielles et fourni des renseignements trompeurs dans le guide d'évaluation?
(iv) Mme Ducharme maîtrisait-elle suffisamment l'anglais pour évaluer les qualifications du plaignant?
(v) L'intimé a-t-il fait preuve de favoritisme personnel envers Mme Langlois parce qu'elle est francophone?
[16]
Dans son dossier de demande, M. Jalal a formulé de cette manière les questions soulevées par le présent contrôle judiciaire:
[traduction]
Le TDFP:
• a statué sur des questions dénuées de pertinence en tenant compte principalement de facteurs non pertinents;
• a fondé sa décision sur une conclusion factuelle erronée sans tenir compte des documents et de la preuve dont il disposait;
• a enfreint son propre règlement et exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire de manière arbitraire;
• a dirigé le processus d'audience de manière contestable;
• a refusé d'examiner la preuve cruciale fournie par le demandeur;
• a rendu sa décision sur la foi des renseignements trompeurs et incorrects du défendeur, auxquels il a donné préséance;
• le demandeur n'a pas eu la possibilité de présenter ses arguments (sa représentante et lui-même ont été interrompus à plusieurs reprises par l'avocat du défendeur au cours de l'audience). Par ailleurs, le demandeur a été privé de la possibilité d'interroger les témoins du défendeur ayant pris part à l'évaluation des personnes nommées.
[17]
En d'autres termes, M. Jalal fait valoir que le Tribunal a erré en droit, que ses conclusions factuelles sont entachées d'erreurs manifestes et dominantes et qu'il a agi de manière inéquitable du point de vue procédural.
INIQUITÉ PROCÉDURALE
[18]
M. Jalal avait le droit de bénéficier de l'équité procédurale et d'une juste opportunité de présenter ses arguments. Sur ces questions, le Tribunal n'a droit à aucune déférence (
Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2013] ACS no 28 (QL)).
[19]
Les plaintes de M. Jalal à ce chapitre sont très nombreuses.
[20]
Il soutient que Ressources humaines et le Tribunal ont échangé des courriels à son insu. Cet échange découlait du fait que le greffe devait transmettre la plainte à l'employeur. Ce dernier s'est naturellement enquis de l'identité de la personne contre laquelle la plainte était dirigée, ce qui a amené le greffe à communiquer avec M. Jalal. Il s'agissait d'une démarche purement administrative, et en aucune manière inéquitable.
[21]
Le jury de sélection était composé de neuf membres. L'employeur a indiqué lors d'une conférence préalable à l'audience qu'il n'avait l'intention d'appeler comme témoins que les deux personnes qui avaient administré l'examen oral à M. Jalal. Ce dernier, de même que la représentante de son syndicat, aurait pu assigner les sept autres à comparaître, mais ils ne l'ont pas fait.
[22]
M. Jalal se plaint que les témoins n'ont pas été exclus de l'audience, ce qui a ouvert la porte à la collusion et au parjure. Il ne revenait pas au Tribunal d'exclure des témoins. M. Jalal et sa représentante auraient pu présenter une requête en ce sens. Son allégation de parjure est tout à fait dénuée de fondement.
[23]
Il prétend que la représentante de son syndicat a été constamment interrompue. Pourtant, cette dernière ne s'en est pas plainte.
[24]
Des éléments de preuve importants ont été exclus. L'audience devait durer deux jours. La preuve a pu être présentée au complet, mais les parties ont manqué de temps pour leurs observations orales. Il a donc été convenu que les observations seraient présentées par écrit. M. Jalal a cherché à tirer profit de cette décision, car il a étoffé son témoignage. M. Mooney a eu raison d'écarter cette preuve. Par exemple, M. Jalal affirmait que les notes prises par les examinateurs durant son examen oral étaient incomplètes. Il lui était loisible de faire cette remarque lors de son témoignage de manière à donner aux deux examinateurs en question, qui ont comparu, la possibilité d'y répondre. Les documents et le « témoignage » reçus après l'audience auraient pu être produits plus tôt. M. Mooney a dûment exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire en décidant de les exclure.
[25]
M. Jalal a également des reproches à faire à sa représentante. Au début de l'audience, cette dernière a retiré la plainte selon laquelle les personnes nommées avaient violé les droits de M. Jalal garantis par la Charte. Il affirme que rien ne l'y autorisait. Cependant, les dispositions de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
ayant trait à la discrimination ont été évoquées durant l'audience. La Charte n'aurait rien apporté de plus.
[26]
M. Jalal estime que certaines des questions examinées par M. Mooney étaient dépourvues de pertinence et qu'il n'en était pas saisi. Il m'est impossible de parvenir à une telle conclusion. Les observations écrites finales déposées devant le Tribunal, rédigées par lui-même plutôt que par la représentante de son syndicat, contiennent quelque 169 paragraphes, et sa réponse ultérieure compte trente pages. Sa demande de contrôle judiciaire était accompagnée d'un affidavit de 100 paragraphes, son mémoire des faits et du droit en contenait 129. La manière dont M. Mooney a formulé les questions en litige n'était pas déraisonnable. Dans le présent contrôle judiciaire, M. Jalal n'est pas revenu sur les allégations selon lesquelles une examinatrice ne parlait pas suffisamment anglais pour comprendre ses réponses à l'examen oral, et que Mme Langlois avait été favorisée à titre de francophone. Ces allégations ont toutefois été soumises à l'attention du Tribunal.
[27]
Je conclus que M. Jalal a bénéficié d'une audience équitable.
CRAINTE RAISONNABLE DE PARTIALITÉ
[28]
S'agissant maintenant de cet autre aspect de la justice naturelle, à savoir la prétendue crainte de partialité, M. Jalal a soumis une analyse des résultats de l'examen que les sept personnes nommées et lui-même ont passé; ces résultats se rapportaient à la fois à l'examen écrit, qui n'a aucune pertinence puisqu'il l'a réussi, et à l'entrevue. Il a conclu:
[traduction] Après examen et comparaison de mes exemples, à savoir les questions A1, A3 et A4, avec les réponses données par toutes les personnes nommées, en particulier les candidats
2, 3, 4
et
5
, il m'apparaît très clairement que mes réponses étaient plus
solides
et justes que la plupart des leurs. Je pense que si un tiers raisonnablement informé comparait mes exemples avec ceux des sept personnes nommées, il relèvera certainement une partialité de la part du jury de sélection.
[29]
M. Jalal demandait en fait au Tribunal de reprendre son évaluation. Or, ce n'était pas là sa fonction, pas plus que ce n'est celle de la Cour. Le Tribunal devait établir si les notes attribuées à M. Jalal et aux autres justifiaient son allégation de partialité ou d'abus. Peut-être qu'un autre jury de sélection lui aurait accordé une note plus élevée, ou peut-être pas. La question n'est pas là. Il s'agit plutôt de savoir si la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle rien ne justifiait une crainte de partialité était raisonnable. Comme le déclarait le juge de Grandpré dans
Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 394:
[...] la crainte de partialité doit être raisonnable et le fait d'une personne sensée et raisonnable qui se poserait elle-même la question et prendrait les renseignements nécessaires à ce sujet. Selon les termes de la Cour d'appel, ce critère consiste à se demander « à quelle conclusion en arriverait une personne bien renseignée qui étudierait la question en profondeur, de façon réaliste et pratique [...]. »
[30]
À mon avis, rien dans le dossier n'étaye la supposition de M. Jalal voulant que le jury de sélection se soit montré partial et qu'il ait choisi une autre candidate par favoritisme, ou que M. Mooney, le vice-président du Tribunal, ait agi de la même manière.
LES CONCLUSIONS DU TRIBUNAL - ERREURS DE FAIT ET DE DROIT
[31]
M. Jalal fait valoir que les erreurs de droit alléguées, et je n'en ai découvert aucune, devraient être contrôlées selon la norme de la décision correcte. Il soutient que M. Mooney n'examinait pas des questions relatives à sa loi constitutive parce que d'autres appliquent également cette loi, et qu'en examinant la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne
, il n'appliquait pas une loi étroitement liée. Cela ne peut pas être vrai puisque le Tribunal est expressément tenu d'envisager la discrimination préjudiciable au sens de la
Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Quoi qu'il en soit, la norme de contrôle n'est pas en cause. Il n'y a pas ici de pure question de droit. Au mieux, nous avons affaire à des questions de fait et de droit et à des conclusions de fait. Depuis l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [2008] ACS no 9 (QL), ces deux types de question sont assujetties à la norme de la raisonnabilité.
[32]
M. Jalal devait donner avis à la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne des questions de fait et de droit pour permettre à celle-ci de participer à l'audience si elle le désirait. C'est ce qu'il a fait, mais la Commission n'a pas souhaité participer.
[33]
Comme le déclarait la Cour suprême dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (précité, au paragraphe 47):
La norme déférente du caractère raisonnable procède du principe à l'origine des deux normes antérieures de raisonnabilité: certaines questions soumises aux tribunaux administratifs n'appellent pas une seule solution précise, mais peuvent plutôt donner lieu à un certain nombre de conclusions raisonnables. Il est loisible au tribunal administratif d'opter pour l'une ou l'autre des différentes solutions rationnelles acceptables. La cour de révision se demande dès lors si la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité. Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[34]
Comme nous le rappelait le juge Iacobucci dans
Canada (Directeur des enquêtes et recherches) c Southam Inc.
, [1997] 1 RCS 748, 209 NR 20, au paragraphe 80:
En guise de conclusion de mon analyse de cette question, je tiens à faire observer que le décideur chargé du contrôle de la décision, et même un décideur appliquant la norme de la décision raisonnable
simpliciter
, sera souvent tenté de trouver un moyen d'intervenir dans les cas où il aurait lui-même tiré la conclusion contraire. Les cours d'appel doivent résister à cette tentation. Mon affirmation selon laquelle je ne serais peut-être pas arrivé à la même conclusion que le Tribunal ne devrait pas être considérée comme une invitation aux cours d'appel à intervenir dans les cas comme celui qui nous intéresse, mais plutôt comme une mise en garde contre pareille intervention et comme un appel à la retenue. La retenue judiciaire s'impose si l'on veut façonner un système de contrôle judiciaire cohérent, rationnel et, à mon sens, judicieux.
[35]
Je reconnais, sans qu'il y ait à ajouter d'autres commentaires, que le Tribunal a correctement établi que l'employeur n'avait pas enfreint son propre règlement.
[36]
M. Jalal a invoqué toutes les imperfections possibles de la procédure. Comme le souligne le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
S'il est vrai que des plaideurs habiles peuvent découvrir quantité d'erreurs lorsqu'ils examinent des décisions de tribunaux administratifs, nous devons toujours nous rappeler ce qu'a dit la Cour suprême du Canada lorsqu'elle a été saisie d'un pourvoi en matière criminelle où les motifs invoqués étaient quelque douze erreurs commises par le juge dans ses directives au jury. En rendant son jugement, la Cour a déclaré qu'elle avait trouvé dix-huit erreurs dans les directives du juge mais que, en l'absence de tout déni de justice, elle ne pouvait accueillir le pourvoi.
[...] Certes, il est toujours possible qu'on ne s'entende pas sur la preuve; Un tribunal différemment constitué pourrait également rendre une décision contraire. Quelqu'un d'autre pourrait tirer une conclusion différente. C'est notamment le cas lorsque la personne qui rend la décision souscrit à un système de valeurs différent. Toutefois, malgré l'exposé approfondi de l'avocat du requérant, je n'arrive pas à saisir le genre d'erreur qu'aurait pu faire la Commission dans sa décision et qui justifierait mon intervention. À mon avis, la décision de la Commission est tout à fait compatible avec la preuve.
DÉPENS
[37]
Il n'y a aucune raison que les dépens ne suivent pas l'issue de la cause. L'employeur a engagé d'importantes ressources pour se défendre en l'espèce. Le ministre suggère un montant global de 3 500 $ pour couvrir les dépens. La Cour peut, à sa discrétion, accorder les dépens sous la forme d'une somme forfaitaire. En fait, cette approche est privilégiée puisqu'elle évite aux deux parties d'avoir à effectuer des calculs détaillés et à se présenter devant un officier taxateur. Cependant, un calcul approximatif ne devrait pas dépasser le tarif B. Compte tenu de la colonne III du tarif B, j'estime les dépens taxables à 17 unités, à raison de 140 $ par unité, soit 2 380 $. Il y a aussi des débours nécessaires. Je fixe les dépens et les débours taxables à 2 750 $, taxes comprises, tout en étant conscient que s'il y avait taxation, le montant serait supérieur.
ORDONNANCE
[38]
POUR LES MOTIFS EXPOSÉS,
LA COUR ORDONNE que
1. la demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée, avec dépens, pour une somme globale de 2 750 $.
