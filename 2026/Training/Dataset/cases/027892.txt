I.
Nature of the Matter and Background
[1]
Boswell, J.
: Mr. Azurdia Gomez [the Principal Applicant] is a 36-year-old citizen of Guatemala who, together with his wife and their two minor children [collectively, the Applicants], left Guatemala on May 10, 2005, and eventually arrived in the United States of America. The Applicants lived in the United States without status until they came to Canada on February 27, 2012, and sought protection the same day, claiming that they would be killed if they returned to Guatemala.
[2]
The Applicants alleged that they had opened a small telephone business in September, 2002, and that members of a gang called Mara 18 [M18] soon began extorting them for money, goods, and services. They eventually ceased operating their business because of such extortion on February 27, 2004. A little more than a year later, M18 members tracked them down and demanded money for closing their business without permission. Several incidents of threats and vandalism to their home followed, and on April 13, 2005, the Principal Applicant was confronted by armed gang members who demanded 100,000 GTQ within 10 days to repay the "debt" owed for having closed down the business without their permission or knowledge. A week later the Principal Applicant was assaulted by three M18 members and reminded that he had three days to pay them. A week or so later the Principal Applicant's wife reported the problems she and the other Applicants had with the M18 to the Public Ministry, and about two weeks after that the Applicants fled the country. They claimed that M18 members are still looking for them.
[3]
The Refugee Protection Division [RPD] rejected the Applicants' request for Canada's protection in a decision dated August 28, 2013. The Applicants now seek judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
], and ask that this Court set aside the RPD's decision and return the matter to a different member of the RPD.
II.
Decision under Review
[4]
The RPD rejected the Applicants' claims for protection, but not because it questioned the truth of their allegations. Before the RPD, counsel for the Applicants had conceded that they were not Convention refugees, and the RPD agreed and found that all they feared was crime which was not connected to any Convention ground. Thus, the RPD dismissed their claim under section 96 of the
IRPA
.
[5]
Consequently, the Applicants could only seek protection under subsection 97(1) of the
IRPA
, but the RPD decided that the risk feared by the Applicants was excluded by subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) because it was "generally faced by other citizens in Guatemala." The Principal Applicant had testified that every business owner in his neighbourhood had been targeted for extortion, and that those who did not comply were killed. The documentary evidence confirmed that this was so throughout the country, and the RPD said that "[e]xtortion intertwined with demands, physical assaults and threats have been recognized as a generalized risk." The RPD decided that the nature of the risk claimed by the Applicants did not differ from that, and said that this Court has many times upheld decisions of the RPD denying protection to people in similar circumstances (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and others). In this regard, the RPD stated:
[36] The cases noted above bear very similar characteristics to the case at hand. Considering the jurisprudence and the evidence in this case, I find that the claimants have not established that the risk of actual or threatened violence they face is not faced generally by other individuals in Guatemala. Furthermore, they have not demonstrated that the risk they face is not prevalent or widespread in Guatemala or that it is not a risk faced by a significant subset of the population.
[37] I find, consequently, on a balance of probabilities, that the risk, which the claimants face, is one that is faced generally by the population of Guatemala. Based on the particular facts of this case, I am not satisfied that the claimants face a particularized risk of harm in accordance with section 97(1) of the IRPA.
III.
The Parties' Submissions
A.
The Applicants' Arguments
[6]
The Applicants argue that the RPD failed to properly characterize and analyze the nature of the particular risk they faced, thereby disobeying the two-step process prescribed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The M18 gang members were not just seeking money; they also relied upon the Applicants' business for communication and telephone services. The Applicants argue that this made the M18 uniquely upset when they closed their business, which is why they went to such great lengths to get revenge. In the Applicants' view, the resulting risk was not similar to that faced by most Guatemalans or even most extorted Guatemalan shopkeepers, and the RPD should have recognized that.
[7]
Furthermore, the Applicants claim that the RPD assessed only the prevalence of the initial risk of extortion, and not the risk of retaliation for refusing to comply. In their view, the RPD erred by over-extending the Applicants' testimony about violent reprisals in their neighbourhood to all of Guatemala. Further, the Applicants argue that the risk of reprisal cannot be treated as a mere extension of the risk of extortion (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (4th) 193 [
Correa
]).
[8]
The Applicants also contend that the RPD was unduly selective in its choice of case law. In their view, there are two lines of cases emanating from this Court on the issue of whether personal targeting by a gang is a generalized risk (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 168), which suggests that the case before the Court is a fact-driven one. They say that the RPD erred not only by ignoring the first branch of case law as exemplified by
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 187, but also by failing to explain why it only chose cases from the less favourable line and ignored the other completely. The Applicants argue that the facts in their case are most analogous to the cases where the RPD's findings of generalized risk have been considered unreasonable, and submit that the RPD did not reasonably assess the pertinent facts.
B.
The Respondent's Arguments
[9]
The Respondent says that the RPD's finding of generalized risk was neither perverse nor capricious. In its view, the RPD was aware that the Applicants feared not just extortion but retribution, and it specifically found that "[g]angs use violence against those who defy their control ... and those who refuse to pay extortion money" (ellipsis in original).
[10]
Furthermore, the Respondent says that the evidence shows every business in the Applicants' neighbourhood was targeted. The nature of extortion is to obtain something through force or threats and, thus, the Respondent argues the fact that the demands in this case included not just money but also goods and services is insignificant (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 1).
[11]
According to the Respondent, it is apparent from the decision that the RPD properly characterized the risk faced by the Applicants. As well, the Respondent contends that the RPD considered all of the evidence and the Applicants quibble only with the weight assigned by the RPD to such evidence. In its view, that cannot justify this Court's intervention (citing
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[12]
The Respondent further argues that there is no division in this Court's decisions in cases involving gang violence and extortion. Rather, the case law simply describes two different sets of factual circumstances, and the Respondent says that it was no error for the RPD to refer only to the cases it considered most helpful (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Kanga
]). Even if the divergent outcomes were the result of a disagreement about the law though, the Respondent submits that the RPD did not need to explain itself (
Kanga
at paragraph 11). The Respondent emphasizes that the RPD's inquiry under section 97 is "highly factual" and urges the Court to defer to the RPD's decision (citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 149).
IV.
Issues and Analysis
A.
Issue
[13]
The determinative issue in this case is whether the RPD erred by finding that the risk faced by the Applicants was generalized, notwithstanding the fact that they had been specifically targeted by the M18.
B.
Standard of Review
[14]
The applicable standard of review for determining whether an applicant faces a generalized risk is one of reasonableness since it involves questions of mixed fact and law (see, e.g.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 210). It is well established that the reasonableness standard is concerned not only with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process, but also with whether the decision under review falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law. This Court can neither reweigh the evidence nor substitute its own view of a preferable outcome (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
C.
Did the RPD err by finding that the risk faced by the Applicants was generalized?
[15]
When assessing the Applicants' claims under subsection 97(1) of the
IRPA
, the RPD accepted that the Applicants feared the M18 who had demanded additional money from them for closing their business without the M18's permission. At the hearing before the RPD, the Principal Applicant testified as follows:
Q. And what do you fear would happen to you, your spouse and your children if you were to return?
A. That they [i.e., the M18] would kill me and that they would kill my children ....
Q. Why do you believe that you were targeted by this gang?
A. Well according to what they told us, it was because we closed the business without their authorization ....
Q. So, why would this gang still be interested in you today, many years later?
A. Because they feel that I have a debt.
There was also evidence before the RPD that the M18 availed themselves of the goods and services of the Applicants' business and had demanded the Applicants' "collaboration in the manner of allowing them to make national and international phone calls or giving them phone cards for their cellphones."
[16]
The RPD here did not reasonably assess the individualized risk to the Principal Applicant and his wife for purposes of section 97. On the one hand, it accepts that the M18 had targeted them personally, since they had closed their business without authorization and owed the M18 a debt; yet, on the other, it concludes that this personal risk is nevertheless generalized, stating as follows:
[31] ... The possibility that the claimants may be identified personally as a target does not necessarily remove them from the generalized risk category, since the nature of the risk is one that is faced generally by others in the country. The nature of the crimes the claimants may be exposed to is widespread in Guatemala and not specific to them. There are many victims of criminal organizations who engage in activities such as extortion and retaliate against non-cooperative victims. The fear the claimants face is not different from that faced by the general public.
[17]
The RPD's decision here is not reasonable because it failed to properly conduct the two-step inquiry to assess the Applicants' present and future risk. In this regard, it is instructive to note the Court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Justice Gleason stated as follows:
[9] As I held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , section 97 of the IRPA mandates the following inquiry. First, the RPD must correctly characterize the nature of the risk faced by the claimant. This requires the Board to consider whether there is an ongoing future risk, and if so, whether the risk is one of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment. Most importantly, the Board must determine what precisely the risk is. Once this is done, the RPD must next compare the risk faced by the claimant to that faced by a significant group in the country to determine whether the risks are of the same nature and degree.
...
[14] The focus of the second step in the inquiry is to compare the nature and degree of the risk faced by the claimant to that faced by all or a significant part of the population in the country to determine if they are the same. This is a forward-looking inquiry and is concerned not so much with the cause of the risk but rather with the likelihood of what will happen to the claimant in the future as compared to all or a significant segment of the general population. It is in this sense that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> I held that one cannot term a "personalized" risk of death "general" because the entire country is not personally targeted for death or torture in any of these cases. There is in this regard a fundamental difference between being targeted for death and the risk of perhaps being potentially so targeted at some point in the future. Justice Shore provides a useful analogy to explain this difference in
Olvera
[
v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2012 FC 1048, 417 FTR 255], where he wrote at para 41, "The risks of those standing in the same vicinity as the gunman cannot be considered the same as the risks of those standing directly in front of him".
[18]
In this case, the Principal Applicant and his family were not members of the general public targeted at random by the M18. Although other business owners in the area where the Principal Applicant and his wife had operated their business were being extorted, the Applicants had run afoul of the M18 since they closed their business without the gang's knowledge or authorization and thereby incurred an individualized debt that they could not repay. It was not reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the Applicants were still within the generalized risk category.
[19]
The nature of the risk or fear faced by the Applicants in this case is not one faced generally by many other business owners in Guatemala or, for that matter, as the RPD stated "the general public." The nature and degree of the risk faced by the Applicants here on a forward-looking basis are not the same as, and in fact cannot be compared to, all or even a significant number of other business owners in Guatemala. Even those business owners who are being extorted by the M18 will not face the risk of death unless they are unable to meet the gang's demands. As noted by Mr. Justice James Russell in
Correa
at paragraphs 83 and 84: "It is an error to conflate the reason for the risk with the risk itself or to ignore differences in the individual circumstances of persons who may be targeted for the same reasons. ... It is an error to dismiss reprisals or the carrying out of threats as merely 'consequential harm' or 'resulting risk' stemming from the initial risk of extortion or forced recruitment. The question is not whether others could eventually find themselves in the Applicant's position; it is whether others 'generally' are in that position now." The RPD committed both those errors in this case and the decision must be set aside.
V.
Conclusion
[20]
As noted above, the RPD here did not reasonably assess the Applicants' individualized risk for the purposes of section 97. This being so, the application for judicial review is hereby allowed and the matter is returned to the RPD for re-determination by a different panel member. Neither party suggested a question for certification; so, no such question is certified.
JUDGMENT
[21]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter returned to the Refugee Protection Division for re-determination by a different panel member. No serious question of general importance is certified.

Le juge Boswell
[Traduction]: M. Azurdia Gomez (le demandeur principal), âgé de 36 ans, est un citoyen du Guatemala qui a quitté son pays le 10 mai 2005 avec son épouse et leurs deux enfants mineurs (collectivement, les demandeurs). Les demandeurs sont arrivés aux États-Unis d'Amérique et y ont vécu sans statut jusqu'à leur entrée au Canada le 27 février 2012. Ils ont demandé l'asile le même jour, affirmant qu'ils se feraient tuer s'ils retournaient au Guatemala.
[2]
Les demandeurs ont allégué qu'ils ont créé une petite entreprise téléphonique en septembre 2002 et que des membres d'un gang, désigné Mara 18, ont vite commencé à leur extorquer de l'argent, des biens et des services. En raison d'une telle extorsion, ils ont fini par cesser d'exploiter leur entreprise le 27 février 2004. Un peu plus d'un an plus tard, des membres du Mara 18 ont réussi à les retrouver et ont exigé un paiement parce qu'ils avaient fermé l'entreprise sans la permission du gang. Plusieurs incidents de menaces et de vandalisme de leur maison en suivi, et, le 13 avril 2005, le demandeur principal a été confronté par des membres armés du gang exigeant le paiement de 100 000 quetzals (GTQ) dans les dix jours à titre de remboursement de la [traduction] « dette » du parce qu'ils avaient fermé l'entreprise sans la permission du Mara 18 et à l'insu de celui-ci. Une semaine plus tard, le demandeur principal a été agressé par trois membres du M 18, qui lui ont rappelé qu'il avait trois jours pour les payer. Environ une semaine plus tard, l'épouse du demandeur principal a signalé au Ministère public les difficultés qu'elle et les autres demandeurs connaissaient avec le Mara 18 et environ deux semaines plus tard, les demandeurs ont fui le pays. Ils soutiennent que des membres du Mara 18 sont encore à leur recherche.
[3]
Dans une décision datée du 28 août 2013, la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) a rejeté la demande d'asile présentée par les demandeurs. Les demandeurs sollicitent maintenant le contrôle judiciaire, en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (LIPR), de la décision et ils demandent à la Cour d'annuler la décision de la SPR et de renvoyer l'affaire à un autre commissaire de la SPR.
II.
La décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[4]
La SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile des demandeurs non parce qu'elle remettait en question la véracité de leurs allégations. À la SPR, le conseil des demandeurs a concédé qu'ils n'étaient pas des réfugiés au sens de la Convention, et la SPR a souscrit à cette concession et conclu qu'ils craignaient simplement d'être victimes d'un crime, qui n'avait aucun lien à l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention. La SPR a donc rejeté leur demande au titre de l'article 96 de la LIPR.
[5]
En conséquence, les demandeurs ne pouvaient solliciter l'asile qu'au titre du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR, mais la SPR a décidé que le risque redouté par les demandeurs était exclu en application du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii), car ce risque « est généralisé et menace tous les citoyens du Guatemala ». Le demandeur principal a témoigné que tous les autres commerçants dans son quartier étaient pris pour cible d'extorsion, et que ceux qui ne s'y conformaient pas se faisaient tuer. La preuve documentaire confirmait que tel était le cas dans l'ensemble du pays, et la SPR a déclaré que « [l]'extorsion combinée avec les demandes, les agressions physiques et les menaces ont été reconnues comme étant un risque généralisé ». La SPR a décidé que la nature du risque allégué par les demandeurs ne s'en distingue pas, elle a ajouté que la Cour a souvent confirmé des décisions de la SPR qui refusaient l'asile à des personnes se trouvant dans des situations semblables (elle citait la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; et d'autres). À ce sujet, la SPR a conclu ainsi:
[36] Les cas présentés ci-dessus ont des caractéristiques très semblables au cas présent. Compte tenu de la jurisprudence et de la preuve dont je dispose en l'espèce, je conclus que les demandeurs d'asile n'ont pas établi que les autres personnes qui se trouvent au Guatemala ne sont généralement pas exposées au même risque de violence ou de menace de violence qu'eux. En outre, ils n'ont pas démontré que le risque auquel ils sont exposés n'est ni courant ni répandu au Guatemala ou qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un risque auquel un sous-groupe important de la population est exposé.
[37] Par conséquent, je conclus, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le risque auquel les demandeurs d'asile sont exposés est un risque auquel la population en général au Guatemala est exposée. À la lumière des faits particuliers à la présente affaire, je ne suis pas convaincue que les demandeurs d'asile sont personnellement exposés à un risque de mauvais traitements conformément au paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR.
III.
Les observations des parties
A.
Les arguments des demandeurs
[6]
Les demandeurs affirment que la SPR a omis de qualifier et d'analyser adéquatement la nature du risque particulier auquel ils étaient exposés, contrairement au processus à deux étapes décrit aux paragraphes 40 et 41 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Portillo)
. Les membres du gang Mara 18 n'exigeaient pas uniquement de l'argent, mais avaient recours au commerce des demandeurs pour leurs services de communication et de téléphone. Les demandeurs font valoir que c'est ce qui a particulièrement mis en colère les membres du Mara 18 quand les demandeurs ont fermé leur entreprise, et ce qui explique pourquoi le Mara 18 à mis tant d'efforts à se venger. Selon les demandeurs, le risque qui en résultait n'est pas semblable à celui auquel sont exposés la plupart des citoyens du Guatemala, ou même la plupart des commerçants du Guatemala soumis à l'extorsion, et la SPR aurait dû le reconnaître.
[7]
De plus, les demandeurs soutiennent que la SPR a apprécié uniquement la fréquence du risque initial d'extorsion, et non le risque de représailles auquel ils étaient exposés parce qu'ils ont refusé d'obtempérer. À leur avis, la SPR a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a donné à leur témoignage une portée excessive quant aux représailles violentes dans leur quartier, qui s'étend à l'ensemble du Guatemala. En outre, les demandeurs font valoir que le risque de représailles ne peut être traité comme une simple extension du risque d'extorsion (ils citent les paragraphes 54 à 57 et 84 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (4th) 193 (
Correa)
).
[8]
Les demandeurs prétendent aussi que la SPR a fait un choix sélectif de la jurisprudence sur laquelle elle s'est fondée. Selon eux, il y a deux courants dans les affaires émanant de la Cour quant à la question de savoir si le fait d'être ciblé personnellement par un gang est un risque généralisé (il cite les paragraphes 61 et 62 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 168), ce qui donne à penser que l'affaire soumise à la Cour repose sur les faits. Les demandeurs affirment que la SPR a commis une erreur non seulement lorsqu'elle n'a pas de tenu compte du premier courant jurisprudentiel - dont la décision de principe est
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 187, au paragraphe 17 -, mais aussi en omettant d'expliquer pourquoi elle a choisi les causes uniquement dans le courant moins favorable, à l'exclusion totale de l'autre courant jurisprudentiel. Les demandeurs soutiennent que les faits de l'espèce s'apparentent davantage aux décisions dans lesquelles la conclusion d'existence d'un risque généralisé par la SPR a été jugée déraisonnable, et les demandeurs font valoir que la SPR n'a pas raisonnablement apprécié les faits pertinents.
B.
Les arguments du défendeur
[9]
Le défendeur affirme que la conclusion de risque généralisé tirée par la SPR n'est ni abusive ni arbitraire. Selon lui, la SPR savait que les demandeurs craignaient non seulement l'extorsion, mais aussi les représailles, et elle a précisément conclu que « [l]es gangs utilisent la violence contre ceux qui défient leur autorité [...] et ceux qui refusent de se faire extorquer de l'argent » (points de suspension dans l'original).
[10]
De plus, le défendeur dit qu'il ressort de la preuve que toutes les entreprises dans le quartier des demandeurs étaient prises pour cibles. En raison de sa nature, l'extorsion consiste à obtenir quelque chose par la force ou les menaces; le défendeur soutient donc qu'il est sans importance que les exactions aient consisté non seulement en des demandes d'argent, mais aussi en des demandes de biens et services (citant le paragraphe 87 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 1).
[11]
Selon le défendeur, il ressort clairement de la décision que la SPR a correctement qualifié le risque auquel étaient exposés les demandeurs. Le défendeur soutient par ailleurs que la SPR a pris en compte l'ensemble des éléments de preuve et que les demandeurs ergotent uniquement sur le poids que la SPR a accordé à ses éléments de preuve. Selon le défendeur, cela ne peut pas justifier l'intervention de la Cour (il cite les paragraphes 12 et 18 de l'arrêt
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[12]
Le défendeur soutient en outre qu'il n'y a pas de courants jurisprudentiels distincts dans les décisions de la Cour portant sur des affaires de violence et d'extorsion par des gangs. Au contraire, la jurisprudence décrit deux ensembles différents de circonstances factuelles, et que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur lorsqu'elle a cité uniquement les affaires qu'elle a jugées les plus utiles (il cite les paragraphes 7 et 8 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Kanga)
). Même s'il existe une jurisprudence partagée de la Cour fédérale sur un point de droit, le défendeur affirme que la SPR n'est pas tenue de s'expliquer (
Kanga
, au paragraphe 11). Le défendeur souligne que l'analyse personnalisée de la SPR exigée par l'article 97 est [traduction] « éminemment factuelle » et il prie la Cour de faire preuve de déférence à l'égard de la décision de la SPR (il cite le paragraphe 7 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 149).
IV.
Question en litige et analyse
A.
La question en litige
[13]
La question déterminante en l'espèce est de savoir si la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant au caractère généralisé du risque auquel les demandeurs étaient exposés, malgré qu'ils aient été précisément pris pour cible par le Mara 18.
B.
La norme de contrôle
[14]
La norme de contrôle applicable pour établir si un demandeur est exposé à un risque généralisé est celle de la décision raisonnable, puisqu'il s'agit d'une question mixte de droit et de fait (voir par exemple la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 210, au paragraphe 10). Il est bien établi que la norme de la décision raisonnable tient non seulement à l'existence de la justification de la décision, de la transparence et de l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, mais aussi à l'appartenance de la décision faisant l'objet du contrôle aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. La Cour ne peut ni soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve, ni substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 47 et 48;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 59 et 61).
C.
La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le risque auquel étaient exposés les demandeurs était généralisé?
[15]
Quand elle a examiné les demandes d'asile des demandeurs au titre du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR, la SPR a accepté que les demandeurs craignaient le Mara 18, qui avait exigé d'eux des paiements supplémentaires parce qu'ils avaient fermé leur entreprise sans la permission du gang. À l'audience de la SPR, le demandeur principal a témoigné comme suit:
[traduction]
Q. Que craignez-vous qu'il arrive à vous, votre épouse et vos enfants si vous deviez retourner là-bas?
R. Qu'il [c'est-à-dire le Mara 18] me tue, et tue aussi mes enfants [...]
Q. Qu'est-ce qui vous fait croire que vous étiez pris pour cible par ce gang?
R. Bien, selon ce que les membres nous ont dit, c'est parce que nous avons fermé l'entreprise sans leur autorisation [...]
Q. Alors, pourquoi donc ce gang s'intéresserait-il encore à vous aujourd'hui, bien des années plus tard?
R. Parce qu'il estime que j'ai une dette envers lui.
La SPR disposait également d'éléments de preuve selon lesquels le Mara 18 se servait des biens et services de l'entreprise des demandeurs, et avait exigé des demandeurs [traduction] « qu'ils collaborent de manière à leur permettre de faire des appels téléphoniques nationaux et internationaux, ou de leur donner des cartes d'appel pour leurs téléphones cellulaires ».
[16]
En l'espèce, la SPR n'a pas raisonnablement examiné le risque personnalisé auquel étaient exposés le demandeur principal et son épouse au titre de l'article 97. D'un côté, elle accepte que le Mara 18 les avait personnellement pris pour cibles parce qu'ils avaient fermé leur entreprise sans autorisation et qu'ils avaient une dette envers le Mara 18, mais d'un autre côté, elle a conclu que ce risque personnalisé est néanmoins généralisé, et a déclaré que:
[31] [...] La possibilité que les demandeurs d'asile soient personnellement pris pour cible ne signifie pas nécessairement qu'ils échappent à la catégorie du risque généralisé, puisque la nature du risque est telle que les autres personnes dans le pays y sont généralement exposées. Les crimes auxquels les demandeurs d'asile peuvent être exposés sont répandus au Guatemala et ne sont pas particuliers à leur cas. De nombreuses personnes sont victimes d'organisations criminelles qui se livrent à des activités comme l'extorsion et se vengent contre les victimes qui ne coopèrent pas. Le risque que redoutent les demandeurs d'asile n'est pas différent de celui qui menace le public en général.
[17]
La décision de la SPR en l'espèce n'est pas raisonnable, parce qu'elle a omis de procéder à l'analyse à deux étapes dans l'évaluation du risque présent et à venir auquel étaient exposés les demandeurs. À cet égard, il convient de relever la décision de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans laquelle la juge Gleason a déclaré ce qui suit:
[9] Comme je l'ai soutenu dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , une analyse fondée sur l'article 97 de la LIPR doit être effectuée. Premièrement, la SPR doit décrire correctement la nature du risque auquel est exposé l'intéressé. Cela exige de la Commission qu'elle considère s'il y a un risque permanent éventuel et, dans l'affirmative, si le risque équivaut à un traitement ou une peine cruel ou inusité. Surtout, la Commission doit déterminer ce qu'est précisément le risque. Une fois cela fait, la SPR doit ensuite comparer le risque auquel est exposé l'intéressé à celui auquel est exposé un groupe significatif de personnes originaires du même pays pour déterminer si les risques sont de même nature et du même degré.
[...]
[14] La deuxième étape de l'analyse a pour principal objet de comparer la nature et le degré du risque auquel est exposé le demandeur à celui auquel est exposée toute la population du pays ou une partie significative de celle-ci, afin de déterminer s'ils sont les mêmes. Il s'agit d'une analyse prospective qui ne touche pas tant à la cause du risque qu'à la probabilité de ce qui arrivera au demandeur dans l'avenir, comparativement à l'ensemble ou à un segment significatif de la population en général. C'est en ce sens que, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , j'ai soutenu qu'on ne peut qualifier de « général » un risque « personnalisé » d'être tué au motif que la totalité du pays n'est pas personnellement la cible d'un meurtre ou de torture dans l'un ou l'autre cas. À cet égard, il y a une différence fondamentale entre le fait d'être exposé au risque d'être tué et celui d'être éventuellement ciblé dans l'avenir. Dans la décision

, 2012 CF 1048, 417 FTR 255], le juge Shore fait une analogie utile pour expliquer cette différence lorsqu'il écrit au paragraphe 42, « Les risques que courent les personnes qui vivent dans le même voisinage que l'homme armé ne peuvent être considérés comme étant les mêmes que ceux que courent les personnes qui se tiennent directement devant lui ».
[18]
En l'espèce, le demandeur principal et sa famille n'étaient pas des membres du public en général que le Mara 18 aurait pris pour cible au hasard. Bien que d'autres commerçants du secteur dans lequel le demandeur principal et son épouse exploitaient leur entreprise étaient victimes d'extorsion, les demandeurs avaient eu des démêlés avec le Mara 18 parce qu'ils avaient fermé leur entreprise à l'insu du gang et sans son autorisation, ils se sont ainsi attiré une dette individualisée qu'il leur était impossible de rembourser. Il était déraisonnable que la SPR conclue que les demandeurs faisaient encore partie de la catégorie des personnes exposées à un risque généralisé.
[19]
La nature de la crainte des demandeurs ou du risque auquel ils étaient exposés en l'espèce n'est pas la même que celle que courent généralement de nombreux autres commerçants du Guatemala ou, si cela est important, comme l'a déclaré la SPR « le public en général ». La nature et le niveau du risque auquel étaient exposés les demandeurs de manière prospective ne sont pas identiques - et en fait, ne peuvent être comparé - à ceux que courent un nombre important d'autres commerçants au Guatemala. Même les commerçants victimes d'extorsion aux mains du Mara 18 ne sont pas exposés à un risque de mort à moins qu'il ne leur soit impossible de répondre aux exigences du gang. Comme l'a fait observer le juge James Russell aux paragraphes 83 et 84 de la décision
Correa
: « On commet une erreur lorsqu'on confond les raisons ou la cause du risque avec le risque lui-même ou lorsqu'on ne tient pas compte des différences qui existent entre la situation personnelle de ceux qui sont susceptibles d'être ciblés pour les mêmes raisons [...] On commet une erreur en ne tenant pas compte des mesures de représailles ou des menaces proférées en les considérant simplement comme un « préjudice consécutif » ou un risque découlant du risque initial d'extorsion ou de recrutement forcé. La question à laquelle il faut répondre n'est pas celle de savoir si d'autres personnes pourraient éventuellement se retrouver dans la situation du demandeur, mais bien de savoir si d'autres personnes se trouvent « généralement » dans cette situation actuellement ». En l'espèce, la SPR a commis ces deux erreurs, et la décision doit être annulée.

Dispositif
[20]
Comme il est mentionné ci-dessus, la SPR n'a pas raisonnablement évalué le risque personnalisé auquel étaient exposés les demandeurs au titre de l'article 97. En conséquence, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie et l'affaire renvoyée à la SPR afin qu'un autre commissaire statue à nouveau sur celle-ci. Aucune des parties n'a proposé de question à certifier et aucune n'est certifiée.
