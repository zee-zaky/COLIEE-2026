McKeown, J.
: The applicant Canada Post Corporation ("Canada Post") applied on February 2, 1993, for judicial review of a decision made by the respondent Minister of Public Works (the "Minister") via a letter dated November 20, 1992, allowing disclosure of information surrounding a lease tender in Charlottetown, P.E.I. The respondent made the decision pursuant to the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1 (the "
Access Act
"). The respondent has moved to strike out the application for judicial review by Canada Post. Section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
bars an application for judicial review where a statutory appeal to this court exists. Section 18.5 provides:
"18.5 Notwithstanding ss. 18 and 18.1, where provision is expressly made by an Act of Parliament for an appeal such as to the court, to the Supreme Court of Canada, to the Court Martial Appeal Court, to the Tax Court of Canada, to the Governor-in-Council or to the Treasury Board from a decision or order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal made by or in the course of proceedings before that board, commission or tribunal, that decision or order is not, to the extent that it may be so appealed, subject to review or to be restrained, prohibited, removed, set aside or otherwise dealt with, except in accordance with that Act [S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 5]."
The rationale behind this provision is to ensure that the party seeks a remedy specifically prescribed by Parliament in the statute governing the proceedings rather than resorting to judicial review under s. 18.1.
[2]
The respondent also bases its move to strike the application of Canada Post for judicial review on the grounds that there is a multiplicity of proceedings since Canada Post has also brought an application for review of the decision under s. 44 of the
Access Act
. Section 44 of the
Access Act
provides a statutory right to apply to the court to review the decision of the respondent and further provides a complete code with broad remedial powers.
[3]
Section 44 reads as follows:
"44(1) Any third party to whom the head of a government institution is required under paragraph 28(1)(b) or subsection 29(1) to give a notice of a decision to disclose a record or a part thereof under this Act may, within 20 days after the notice is given, apply to the court for a review of the matter.
"44(2) The head of a government institution who has given notice under paragraph 28(1)(b) or subsection 29(1) that a record requested under this Act or a part thereof will be disclosed shall forthwith on being given notice of an application made under subsection (1) in respect of the disclosure give written notice of the application to the person who requested access to the record.
"44(3) Any person who has been given notice of an application for a review under subsection (2) may appear as a party to the review. (R.S. 1985, c. A-1, s. 44 R.S. 1985, c. 1 (4th Supp.), s. 45(F))"
[4]
The applicant also seeks an order extending the time for delivery of its application. The respondent made no submission with respect to the application for extension of time.
[5]
Since it is not listed in Schedule 1 to the
Access Act
the applicant Canada Post is not a "government institution" within the meaning of that term as defined in the
Access Act
and is accordingly a "third party" within the meaning of that term in s. 3 of the
Access Act
.
[6]
The respondent Minister is a department of the Government of Canada and is a "Government institution" as defined in the
Access Act
. However, the issue is whether certain documents under the physical control of the Minister in its capacity as agent for the applicant Canada Post were under the control of the Minister within the meaning of the
Access Act
. This issue was argued before Rothstein, J., in another proceeding in this court involving the same parties and one additional respondent (Court File No. T-2059-91). He held on June 3, 1993 that the records in question were under the control of the Minister. Canada Post filed a notice of appeal from that decision on June 11, 1993. Canada Post submits that it is directly affected by the Minister's decision to release the lease tender documents and brought the application for judicial review on the grounds that the Minister exceeded its jurisdiction and, therefore, acted contrary to the law. It further submits that this jurisdictional question cannot be considered under s. 44 of the
Access Act
.
[7]
While I agree that the question whether the preliminary issue of the control of the documents should be heard in the context of a s. 44 application was not raised nor decided by Rothstein, J., it would have been appropriate to raise this matter before him in order to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings. Every tribunal has the power to determine whether it has the right to enforce the provisions of its statute upon undertaking an inquiry. Under s. 44 the reviewing court may look at this issue and determine whether the tribunal has properly exercised its power.
[8]
The issue is the meaning of the word "appeal" in s. 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
. Is the word "appeal" a term of art or does it have a broad meaning?
[9]
In my view "appeal" in s. 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
has as its essential nature the review of the decision of an inferior body by a superior court for the purpose of testing the soundness of the decision. An "appeal" may include a trial de novo, an appeal to the Governor-in-Council, a stated case appeal and traditional appeals upon the record created in the tribunal or court below. The purpose of ss. 18 and 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
is to ensure that every party has the right to have a decision of an inferior body reviewed. Section 18.5 is designed to limit the operation of ss. 18 and 18.1 to cases where no review or appeal is provided in the governing statute. In other words its purpose is to avoid multiplicity of proceedings. As Reid states in
Administrative Law and Practice
(2nd Ed.) Toronto, Butterworths (1978), at pp. 464 and 465 "review power is usually considered to be wider than 'appellate' power". While s. 18.5 only requires an appeal under the governing statute, s. 44 of the
Access Act
provides for the wider review process, in effect a trial de novo.
[10]
The definition of "appeal" in Walker, D.M.,
The Oxford Companion To Law
, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980, is also instructive:
"an application to a person, body, court, or tribunal superior to one which has decided an issue, to reconsider that decision and, if thought fit, to alter it. The major functions of an appeal are to satisfy litigants that a case has been reconsidered, and secure rulings of general future application."
[11]
Section 44 of the
Access Act
provides such a reconsideration.
[12]
As Spence, J., stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 752:
"... in every case the meaning of the statutory provision must be obtained by consideration not only of the actual words in a subsection but of the whole statute and by considering the purpose of the legislation."
[13]
Taschereau, C.J., stated the proposition slightly differently earlier in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 381:
"... A statute must not be construed so as to defeat the clear intention of Parliament as the appellants would have us to do here."
[14]
As the remedy within s. 44 of the
Access Act
involves a review in the nature of a trial de novo, s. 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
provides an effective bar to any judicial review proceedings the applicant seeks to commence.
[15]
I cannot agree that jurisdictional issues must be dealt with separately from appeal questions. This argument was made and dismissed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the latter stated:
"The learned judge of first instance held that, in this case, s. 29 [now s. 18.5] did not deprive the Trial Division of the jurisdiction to grant the application made by the respondents under s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
because, in his view, the appeal provided for in the
Income Tax Act
was restricted to questions of 'quantum and liability' while the respondents' application raised the more fundamental question of the Minister's legal authority to make the assessments. We cannot agree with that distinction. The right of appeal given by the
Income Tax Act
is not subject to any such limitations.
"
In our view, the
Income Tax Act
expressly provides for an appeal as such to the Federal Court from assessments made by the Minister; it follows, according to s. 29 of the
Federal Court Act
, that those assessments may not be reviewed, re- strained or set aside by the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under ss. 18 and 28 of the
Federal Court Act
.
" (emphasis added)
[16]
This decision was followed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Fed. C.A.) where Urie, J.A., reviewed with approval the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case and then stated:
"[23] Accordingly, it matters not whether the assessment made on June 3, 1985 is at this stage moot or not. By virtue of s. 29 of the
Federal Court Act
the Trial Division lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief sought in the s. 18 application since the
Income Tax Act
provides the appropriate procedure for appealing the assessment. In those proceedings all issues relating to the assessment, including its validity and mootness, may be raised. This appeal, therefore, in my view, must be allowed."
[17]
It was submitted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that fairness arguments were properly made as an application under s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
to set aside an administrative decision rather than on a s. 44 review. Jerome, A.C.J., appeared not to agree and found at pp. 28-29 that the "rather comprehensive nature of a s. 44 review ought to cure whatever procedural defects may have been present when the decision was made".
[18]
All matters in this case could have been heard at one hearing if the applicants had sought the proper remedy under s. 44 of the
Access Act
. Section 18.5 does not provide them with a second opportunity. In my view, it does not assist the applicant that it has now withdrawn its application for a review under s. 44 of the
Access Act
, on consent.
[19]
The applicant also submits that Federal Court Rule 1314 specifically presumes that an appeal and an application for judicial review can coexist and provides for joinder where appropriate. However, the appeal rules are not applicable to a s. 44 review. As I held earlier there is nothing to prevent the review of jurisdiction being sought from being included in a review under s. 44.
[20]
Accordingly the respondent Minister's motion to strike the originating notice of motion dated February 2, 1993 being the application for judicial review by the applicant Canada Post Corporation is granted with costs to the respondent.
Application dismissed.
