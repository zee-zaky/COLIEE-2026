Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
O'Keefe, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision of an officer at the New Delhi Immigration Section of the Canadian High Commission (the officer), dated January 27, 2011, wherein the applicant's request for a work permit was denied. This conclusion was based on the officer's finding that the applicant did not meet the necessary language and work experience requirements.
[2]
The applicant requests that the officer's decision be quashed and the matter sent back for redetermination by a different officer.
Background
[3]
The applicant is of Chinese ancestry and is a citizen of India. He is married and has three dependants. He lives with his family in India.
[4]
On December 3, 2010, the applicant submitted an application for a Canadian work permit as a cook of Indian-style Hakka Chinese food.
[5]
The application included a positive Labour Market Opinion (LMO) issued on October 27, 2010 to the Royal Chinese Seafood Restaurant, the applicant's proposed employer in Scarborough, Ontario. The letter in which the LMO was issued included a confirmation by Service Canada of the Royal Chinese Seafood Restaurant's offer of employment to the applicant (the LMO-approved employment offer).
[6]
The LMO specified that the job required the applicant to have oral and written English. The LMO-approved employment offer stated that the position was for a cook specializing in Indian / Cantonese Chinese Cuisine (Hakka food).
[7]
The Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) document checklist for a work permit requires that applicants include "proof indicating you meet the requirements of the job being offered". To fulfill this requirement, the applicant included the following documentation in his application:
Language: School certificates from 1989 and 1991 showing passing grades in English; and
Work experience: Letters of recommendation and recent salary slips from Golden Empire Restaurant and Bar in India. The letters indicated that the applicant was employed as head chef at the restaurant for over seven years on a full time basis and described the applicant as a "chef for all seasons" who is "particularly good in Asian foods preparations".
Officer's Decision
[8]
In a letter dated January 27, 2011, the officer denied the applicant's request for a work permit (the decision). The decision was based on the officer's finding that the applicant did not meet the language and work experience requirements specified in the LMO.
[9]
In the Global Case Management System (GCMS) notes that form part of the decision, the officer acknowledged that the applicant had provided banking documents, pay slips, an income tax form and school records. However, the officer found that the applicant had not provided proof that he met the English requirements specified in the LMO or the requirements of work experience in Indian-style Hakka Chinese food. The officer also found that the letter from the applicant's employer did not state the applicant's qualifications. The officer therefore refused the applicant's application.
Issues
[10]
The applicant submits the following point at issue:
Error of Law: Did the respondent err in failing to provide the applicant an opportunity to disabuse the officer's concerns?
[11]
I would rephrase the issues as follows:
1. What is the appropriate standard of review?
2. Did the officer deny the applicant procedural fairness?
3. Did the officer err in denying the applicant's application?
Applicant's Written Submissions
[12]
The applicant submits that he was never given an opportunity to respond to the officer's concerns regarding the language and work experience requirements and that this was a clear breach of procedural fairness. As this is fundamentally a question of law, natural justice and procedural fairness, it attracts a standard of review of correctness.
[13]
Nevertheless, the applicant submits that he did provide school documents as evidence of his ability to meet the English requirement. As such, unless the credibility of the documents was at issue, there was no reason for the respondent not to believe that the applicant met the English requirement. The applicant submits that the officer's decision on this point was therefore completely unsupported.
[14]
Similarly, the applicant submits that he did provide clear evidence of his experience as a Chinese food chef. Although the letters did not specify that it was Hakka Chinese food, a quick inquiry would have clarified this issue. The applicant refers to case law in which it submits the Court has held that an officer's failure to make simple inquiries was remarkably unfair. The applicant submits that in this case the officer's decision on this point was willfully blind.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[15]
The respondent submits that the applicant has not demonstrated an arguable case upon which the application for judicial review may proceed.
[16]
The respondent submits that an officer's decision on a work permit application is reviewable on a reasonableness standard. As this type of decision is highly fact-based and discretionary and involves interpretation by the officer of its own statutes and policies, deference is warranted.
[17]
The respondent submits that the duty of procedural fairness applicable to these types of decisions varies according to context. As there is no evidence that reapplying with improved information and documentation will cause the applicant hardship, the respondent submits that the procedural fairness required is relatively low.
[18]
The respondent also submits that the question of whether the officer should have provided the applicant an opportunity to respond to concerns should be assessed on a standard of correctness. However, in this case, the procedural fairness does not require an officer assessing a work permit to inform the applicant of concerns regarding inadequacies in the application or to request additional information. In addition, an applicant is not entitled to an interview to correct deficiencies in the application. The burden of establishing the merits of the application rests on the applicant.
[19]
The respondent submits that this case does not fall into one of the exceptions where an officer may be required to provide an applicant with the opportunity to respond to its concerns. Rather, the officer's decision shows that the officer assessed the letter from the applicant's employer and the applicant's submission on his English language ability and found that these failed to substantiate his work experience and language ability. It was within the officer's purview to reject the application on these bases.
[20]
The respondent also submits that the officer's decision was reasonable. In support, the respondent refers to paragraph 200(3)(a) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations), which the respondent submits prevents an officer from issuing a work permit if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the foreign national is unable to perform the work sought. The respondent submits that the applicant must establish that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that he will be unable to perform the work.
[21]
As the reference letters from the applicant's employer, Golden Empire Restaurant and Bar, do not clearly substantiate that he has experience specifically in Indian-style Hakka Chinese food, the respondent submits that it was reasonable for the officer to find that the applicant had submitted insufficient evidence of his work experience as a cook with that speciality. Similarly, the respondent submits that as there was no evidence specifically addressing the applicant's English abilities, it was reasonable for the officer to find insufficient proof that the applicant met the English requirements specified in the LMO.
[22]
For these reasons, the respondent submits that the officer's decision was reasonable.
Analysis and Decision
Distinguishing Permits: Skilled Worker Class versus Worker
[23]
This case pertains to an application for a work permit under Part 11 (Workers) of the Regulations (workers work permit). The associated regulatory regime differs in some significant ways from the skilled worker applications regulated under Division 1 of Part 6 (Economic Class - Skilled Workers) of the Regulations (skilled worker class permit).
[24]
Most notably, persons in the skilled worker class may seek permanent residency in Canada (subsection 75(1) of the Regulations) whereas workers work permits only grant holders a temporary stay in Canada until the end date indicated on their permits. As the skilled worker class grants greater access to Canadian residency, specific selection criteria are outlined in the Regulations (sections 76 through 83). For example, points are specified for different levels of education (i.e., secondary, post-secondary, university, etc.). Conversely, the statutory provisions for worker work permits are more general, with few details on actual application requirements.
[25]
Provisions under Division 1 of Part 6 (Economic Class - Skilled Workers) have also had greater judicial treatment than those under Part 11 (Workers) of the Regulations. As such, jurisprudence on workers work permit applications has drawn from the case law on skilled worker class permit applications (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1663; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 1614 at paragraph 12). However, as the two processes and associated rights differ, some care must be taken in applying the jurisprudence of one to the other. In the following analysis, I have therefore noted where cases pertain to skilled worker class permits as opposed to workers work permits.
[26]
Issue 1
What is the appropriate standard of review?
Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).
[27]
Determinations by officers on work permit applications are administrative decisions made within their legislative authority. These fact-based decisions should be granted a high degree of deference and are therefore reviewable on a reasonableness standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 256 at paragraph 26; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 10; and skilled worker class jurisprudence:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ No 811 at paragraph 6; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No. 1765 at paragraph 11).
[28]
In reviewing the officer's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the officer came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] SCJ No 12 at paragraph 59). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraphs 59 and 61).
[29]
Conversely, issues that go to the fairness of an impugned decision must be decided on a standard of correctness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 115; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 371 at paragraph 15).
[30]
In this case, the applicant submits that he was not granted an opportunity to respond to the officer's concerns. A denial of the opportunity to respond to an officer's concerns is a procedural fairness issue that is reviewable on a standard of correctness (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 16). No deference is owed to the decision maker and the Court must form its own opinion on this issue (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 50).
[31]
Issue 2
Did the officer deny the applicant procedural fairness?
In immigration applications, the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the officer of all parts of the application. As such, it is generally not a procedural fairness requirement that work permit applicants be granted an opportunity to respond to the concerns of officers. This is particularly true where there is no evidence of serious consequences to the applicant (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] FCJ No 1098 at paragraph 5). A lack of serious consequences has been found in situations where applicants are able to re-apply for workers work permits and there is no evidence that doing so will cause them hardship (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1563 at paragraph 30).
[32]
However, there are exceptions to this rule and, in certain circumstances, the duty to grant applicants an opportunity to respond is warranted. For example, if an officer uses extrinsic evidence to form an opinion or forms a subjective opinion that an applicant could not have known would be used in an adverse way, the officer may be under a duty to grant the applicant an opportunity to respond (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 1625 at paragraph 36; and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 23).
[33]
In jurisprudence on applications for skilled worker class permits it has also been held that if the officer has concerns about the veracity of documents, procedural fairness demands that the officer make further inquires (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] FCJ No 1779 at paragraphs 18 and 19; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] FCJ No 1383 at paragraphs 29 and 33).
[34]
However, an officer is generally not under a duty to inform a skilled worker class permit applicant about his concerns when they arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraphs 23 and 24; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 771 at paragraph 43).
[35]
These findings in cases on skilled worker class permits have been approvingly referred to in jurisprudence on workers work permit applications (see
Singh
above, at paragraphs 40 to 42).
[36]
In this case, there is no evidence that re-application would cause serious consequences to the applicant. Similarly, there is no indication that the officer had concerns about the veracity of the documents, relied on extrinsic evidence to form his opinion, or formed a subjective opinion that the applicant could not have known would be used in an adverse way.
[37]
Nevertheless, relying on skilled worker class permit jurisprudence, it should be determined whether the officer's concerns arose directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations. If they did not, it is more likely that the procedural fairness required might include an opportunity for the applicant to respond to the officer's concerns in specific circumstances.
[38]
As mentioned above, the statutory provisions describing the requirements for workers work permit applications are less specific than those for skilled worker permits. Part 11 of the Regulations only describe minimal requirements for worker work permit applications. Subsection 200(1) of the Regulations states that an officer shall issue a workers work permit to a foreign national if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the applicant meets all of the requirements of that section.
[39]
In this case, the applicant applied from outside Canada and had an offer of employment that had been approved in a valid LMO (the LMO-approved employment offer). Subsection 200(1) therefore only required that it be established that the applicant would leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for his stay. No evidence was presented on this issue and the officer's decision does not suggest that this was a concern that led to the denial of the application.
[40]
There is little other statutory guidance to inform a workers work permit applicant of the specific application requirements.
[41]
Nevertheless, subsection 200(1) of the Regulations must be read in conjunction with subsection 200(3), which lists various exceptions for which an officer shall not issue a workers work permit. An applicant has the onus to establish that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that he or she will be unable to perform the work sought (see
Samuel
above, at paragraph 30). The only exception relevant to this case is paragraph 200(3)(a), which prohibits an officer from issuing a workers work permit if "there are reasonable grounds to believe that the foreign national is unable to perform the work sought".
[42]
In this case, the officer found that:
Subject has not provided proof that he meets the requirement of English according to the LMO or that he meets with the work experience in Indian style Hakka Chinese food. Letter from employer does not state subject's qualifications.
[43]
However, in his application, the applicant submitted school records showing passing grades in English in support of the language requirement. Nevertheless, the officer found that the applicant had not provided proof that he met the English requirements "according to the LMO". The LMO merely stated that the job requires written and oral English. Further, as mentioned above, unlike the skilled worker class, there are no levels of education specified in the Regulations for worker work permits. Although the applicant's English grades were not high, there was no evidence on which to find them inadequate for the requirements specified in the LMO. In addition, there is nothing in either the statutory provisions or the CIC policies to suggest that school records would be inadequate to establish the applicant's proficiency in English.
[44]
In his application, the applicant also included letters of reference and pay slips in support of his work experience. As noted by the officer, the reference letters do not clearly specify Hakka cuisine. They do, however, speak highly of the applicant as a cook with many years experience and particular skills in Asian foods preparation. In addition, they are from the Golden Empire Restaurant and Bar. Therefore, if there was any confusion on the type of restaurant that the applicant's previous employer in India was, it could easily have been uncovered that it was likely a Chinese food restaurant. This is further supported by the fact that the applicant holds Indian citizenship but is of Chinese ancestry (as indicated in his work permit application).
[45]
The officer also stated that the applicant had failed to establish his work experience in Indian-style Hakka Chinese food. However, the LMO-approved employment offer clearly states that the duties of the position are for a cook specializing in "Indian/Cantonese Chinese Cuisine (Hakka food)".
[46]
The evidence from the applicant's previous employer, his cultural heritage and his nationality renders it difficult to find the reasonable grounds on which the officer could find the applicant unable to perform the work sought.
[47]
A comparison of the employment duties listed in the LMO-approved employment offer and the applicant's responsibilities and skills stated in the reference letters from his Indian employer also shows significant similarities:
1. Duties listed in LMO-approved employment offer:
Specialization in Indian/Cantonese Chinese Cuisine (Hakka food); preparing the main sauces and marinades for meat and poultry; cooking, garnishing and presentation of food; preparing and cooking individual dishes and foods; ensuring quality of food; and determining size of food proportions.
2. Reference letter from Golden Empire Restaurant and Bar (India):
Chef for all seasons, and particularly good in Asian foods preparations; training second cooks and junior kitchen staff; taking care of the discipline and neatness of kitchen staff; checking the presentation of food before it is served to the customers; and speaking with customers for food inquiries.
[48]
This evidence also contradicts the officer's finding that the reference letters did not state the applicant's qualifications.
[49]
In summary, the evidence before the officer, coupled with the limited guidance provided in the statutory provisions relating to workers work permit applications, renders this a situation in which procedural fairness demands that the officer give the applicant an opportunity to respond to his concerns. Although there is generally no obligation on an officer to make further inquiries when an application is ambiguous, this is an instance where the facts favour an exception to the rule. Therefore, in this case, the officer's failure to grant the applicant the opportunity to respond to his concerns results in a denial of procedural fairness to the applicant.
[50]
Because of my finding on Issue 2, I need not deal with the remaining issue.
[51]
As a result of the breach of procedural fairness, the officer's decision must be set aside and the matter referred to a different officer for redetermination.
[52]
Neither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.
JUDGMENT
[53]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the officer is set aside and the matter is referred to a different officer for redetermination.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,
LC 2001, ch. 27 (la Loi) visant une décision datée du 27 janvier 2011 d'un agent de la section de l'immigration du Haut-commissariat du Canada à New Delhi (l'agent), par laquelle la demande de permis de travail du demandeur a été rejetée. La décision reposait sur la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle le demandeur ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences relatives aux compétences linguistiques et à l'expérience de travail.
[2]
Le demandeur prie la Cour d'annuler la décision de l'agent et de renvoyer l'affaire à un autre agent pour qu'il procède à un nouvel examen.
Le contexte
[3]
D'ascendance chinoise, le demandeur est un citoyen de l'Inde. Marié, il a trois personnes à charge. Il vit avec sa famille en Inde.
[4]
Le 3 décembre 2010, le demandeur a présenté une demande de permis de travail au Canada à titre de cuisinier de cuisine chinoise hakka de style indien.
[5]
La demande comportait un avis relatif au marché du travail (AMT) favorable, ayant été délivré le 27 octobre 2010 à l'employeur proposé, le restaurant Royal Chinese Seafood situé à Scarborough (Ontario). La lettre relative à l'AMT contenait une confirmation par Service Canada de l'offre d'emploi que le restaurant Royal Chinese Seafood avait faite au demandeur (l'offre d'emploi approuvée suivant l'AMT).
[6]
L'AMT précisait que l'emploi exigeait que le demandeur sache parler et écrire en anglais. Il était indiqué dans l'offre d'emploi visée par l'AMT qu'il s'agissait d'un poste de cuisinier spécialisé en cuisine chinoise indienne / cantonaise (cuisine hakka).
[7]
Suivant la liste de contrôle des documents de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC) relative aux autorisations d'emploi les requérants doivent fournir une « preuve [qu'ils] réponde[nt] aux exigences de l'emploi offert ». Pour satisfaire à cette exigence, le demandeur a fourni la documentation suivante avec sa demande:
Compétences linguistiques: les certificats scolaires de 1989 et 1991 indiquant qu'il avait obtenu les notes de passage en anglais.
Expérience de travail: des lettres de recommandation et des bordereaux de paie récents du Golden Empire Restaurant and Bar en Inde. Les lettres indiquaient que le demandeur avait travaillé comme premier chef au restaurant pendant plus de sept ans à temps plein et décrivait le demandeur comme un [traduction] « chef pouvant cuisiner en toute saison » qui est « particulièrement compétent dans la préparation de mets asiatiques ».
La décision de l'agent
[8]
Dans une lettre datée du 27 janvier 2011, l'agent a rejeté la demande de permis de travail du demandeur (la décision) parce qu'il était d'avis qu'il ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences en matière de compétences linguistiques et d'expérience de travail, qui étaient précisées dans l'AMT.
[9]
Dans les notes du système mondial de gestion des cas (SMGC) qui font partie de la décision, l'agent a reconnu que le demandeur avait fourni des documents bancaires, des bordereaux de paie, une déclaration de revenus et des dossiers scolaires. Cependant, l'agent a jugé que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences relatives à la connaissance de l'anglais, qui sont précisées dans l'AMT, ou aux exigences en matière d'expérience de travail en cuisine chinoise hakka de style indien. L'agent a également estimé que la lettre de l'employeur du demandeur ne faisait pas état des qualifications du demandeur. Il a par conséquent rejeté la demande du demandeur.
Les questions en litige
[10]
Le demandeur soulève la question suivante:
Erreur de droit: le défendeur a-t-il commis une erreur en n'accordant pas au demandeur la possibilité de réfuter les préoccupations de l'agent?
[11]
Je reformulerais les questions en litige comme suit:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
2. L'agent a-t-il manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale envers le demandeur?
3. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur en rejetant la demande du demandeur?
Les observations écrites du demandeur
[12]
Le demandeur fait valoir qu'on ne lui a jamais donné la possibilité de répondre aux préoccupations de l'agent en ce qui avait trait aux exigences en matière de compétences linguistiques et d'expérience de travail et que cela constituait manifestement un manquement à l'équité procédurale. Cette question appelle l'application de la norme de la décision correcte, car il s'agit essentiellement d'une question de droit, de justice naturelle et d'équité procédurale.
[13]
Le demandeur fait néanmoins valoir qu'il a présenté des documents scolaires comme preuve de sa capacité de satisfaire à l'exigence relative à la connaissance de l'anglais. Sauf si la véracité des documents était mise en doute, aucune raison ne pouvait amener le défendeur à croire que le demandeur ne satisfaisait pas à cette exigence. Par conséquent, le demandeur soutient que la décision de l'agent sur ce point n'était aucunement étayée.
[14]
De même, le demandeur soutient avoir présenté une preuve établissant clairement qu'il possédait de l'expérience comme chef de cuisine chinoise. Les lettres ne précisaient pas qu'il s'agissait de cuisine chinoise hakka, mais une simple demande de renseignements aurait permis d'obtenir des précisions. Le demandeur renvoie à des décisions dans lesquelles la Cour a selon lui statué que le défaut d'un agent de procéder à de simples demandes de renseignements est manifestement inéquitable. Le demandeur fait valoir qu'en l'espèce l'agent a délibérément choisi de laisser subsister le doute.
Les observations écrites du défendeur
[15]
Le défendeur fait valoir que le demandeur n'a pas démontré que sa demande de contrôle judiciaire révèle l'existence d'une cause défendable.
[16]
Le défendeur soutient que la décision d'un agent sur une demande de permis de travail est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable. Il convient de faire preuve de retenue relativement à ce type de décision qui dépend grandement des faits, est discrétionnaire et requiert l'interprétation par l'agent des lois et politiques qu'il est chargé d'appliquer.
[17]
Le défendeur fait valoir que les obligations en matière d'équité procédurale applicable au type de décision en cause en l'espèce varient selon le contexte. Comme rien ne démontre que la présentation d'une nouvelle demande, mieux étayée, causera des difficultés au demandeur, le défendeur soutient que les exigences en matière d'équité procédurale sont relativement peu élevées.
[18]
Le défendeur fait également valoir que la question de savoir si l'agent était tenu de donner au demandeur la possibilité de répondre à ses préoccupations appelle l'application de la norme de la décision raisonnable. Cependant, en l'espèce, l'équité procédurale n'exige pas de l'agent chargé d'étudier la demande de permis de travail qu'il informe le demandeur de ses préoccupations quant aux lacunes que présente la demande ou qu'il demande que des renseignements additionnels lui soient fournis. De plus, le demandeur n'a pas droit à une entrevue pour corriger les lacunes de sa demande. Le fardeau de démontrer le bien-fondé de la demande incombe au demandeur.
[19]
Le défendeur fait valoir que la présente affaire ne constitue pas une exception permettant qu'on exige de l'agent qu'il donne au demandeur la possibilité de répondre à ses préoccupations. La décision de l'agent montre plutôt qu'il a considéré la lettre de l'employeur du demandeur ainsi que les déclarations de celui-ci sur sa connaissance de l'anglais et qu'il a conclu que ces documents ne démontraient pas qu'il possédait l'expérience de travail et les compétences linguistiques requises. Pour ces motifs, il était loisible à l'agent de rejeter la demande.
[20]
Le défendeur fait en outre valoir que la décision de l'agent était raisonnable. À l'appui de cette prétention, il invoque l'alinéa 200(3)
a
) du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 (le Règlement), qui selon lui fait obstacle à la délivrance d'un permis de travail si l'agent a des motifs raisonnables de croire que l'étranger est incapable d'exercer l'emploi pour lequel le permis est demandé. Le défendeur soutient que le demandeur doit démontrer qu'il n'existe pas de motif raisonnable de croire qu'il ne sera pas en mesure d'exercer l'emploi.
[21]
Comme les lettres de recommandation de l'employeur du demandeur, Golden Empire Restaurant and Bar, n'établissent pas clairement qu'il a une expérience de travail en cuisine chinoise hakka de style indien, le défendeur fait valoir qu'il était raisonnable de la part de l'agent de conclure que la preuve présentée par le demandeur quant à son expérience de travail comme cuisinier dans cette spécialité était insuffisante. De même, le défendeur fait valoir que, comme aucune preuve ne concerne directement les compétences du demandeur en anglais, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agent de conclure à l'insuffisance de la preuve visant à démontrer que le demandeur satisfaisait aux exigences précisées dans l'AMT en matière de connaissance de l'anglais.
[22]
Pour les raisons susmentionnées, le défendeur soutient que la décision de l'agent était raisonnable.
Analyse et décision
Deux types de permis: la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés et la catégorie des travailleurs
[23]
La présente affaire concerne une demande de permis de travail visée à la Partie 11 (travailleurs) du Règlement (permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs). Le régime réglementaire applicable diffère à certains égards importants de celui qui régit les demandes présentées à titre de travailleur qualifié, soit la Division 1 de la Partie 6 (immigration économique - travailleurs qualifiés) du Règlement (permis au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés).
[24]
Il importe de souligner que les personnes appartenant à la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés peuvent solliciter la résidence permanente au Canada (paragraphe 75(1) du Règlement) alors que les titulaires d'un permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs n'acquièrent que le droit de résider temporairement au Canada jusqu'à la date d'expiration indiquée dans leurs permis. Comme les personnes appartenant à la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés ont un meilleur accès à la résidence permanente, des critères de sélection précis sont énoncés dans le Règlement (les articles 76 à 83). Par exemple, des points sont attribués pour les divers niveaux d'études (les études secondaires, les études postsecondaires, l'université, etc.). Les dispositions législatives relatives aux permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs sont quant à elles plus générales et sont peu précises quant aux exigences applicables.
[25]
Les dispositions de la Division 1 de la Partie 6 (immigration économique - travailleurs qualifiés) ont fait l'objet d'une jurisprudence plus abondante que celles de la Partie 11 (travailleurs) du Règlement. Pour cette raison, la jurisprudence sur les demandes de permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs s'inspire de la jurisprudence relative aux demandes de permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1663; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 1614 au paragraphe 12). Cependant, comme les deux processus et les droits qui y sont associés diffèrent, il faut faire preuve de prudence lorsque, s'agissant d'une demande fondée sur la Division 1, on s'appuie sur des décisions portant sur la Partie II, et vice versa. Pour cette raison, dans l'analyse qui suit, je le précise lorsque les décisions auxquelles je me réfère concernent les permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés plutôt que les permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs.
Question en litige no 1
Quelle est la norme de contrôle judiciaire applicable?
[26]
Lorsque la jurisprudence établit déjà la norme de contrôle à laquelle une question particulière est assujettie, le tribunal de contrôle peut appliquer cette norme (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 57).
[27]
Les décisions des agents sur des demandes de permis de travail constituent des décisions administratives rendues en vertu des pouvoirs que la loi confère aux agents. Il convient de faire preuve d'une grande déférence à l'égard de ces décisions qui reposent sur les faits et qui sont en conséquence susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 256, au paragraphe 26; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, au paragraphe 10; et la jurisprudence relative à la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] ACF no 811, au paragraphe 6; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 1765, au paragraphe 11).
[28]
Lors du contrôle de la décision d'un agent selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si l'agent est parvenu à une conclusion qui n'est pas transparente, justifiable et intelligible, et qui n'appartient pas aux issues acceptables fondées sur la preuve dont l'agent disposait (voir
Dunsmuir,
ci-dessus, au paragraphe 47;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACS no 12, au paragraphe 59). Comme la Cour suprême l'a statué dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, le tribunal de contrôle ne doit pas imposer le point de vue qui serait à son avis préférable et il ne lui appartient pas de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve (aux paragraphes 59 et 61).
[29]
Par contre, les questions qui touchent à l'équité de la décision contestée doivent être tranchées selon la norme de la décision correcte (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 115; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 371, au paragraphe 15).
[30]
En l'espèce, le demandeur fait valoir qu'on ne lui a pas accordé la possibilité de répondre aux préoccupations de l'agent. Le refus d'accorder la possibilité de répondre aux préoccupations d'un agent constitue une question d'équité procédurale qui est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte (voir
Hara,
ci-dessus, au paragraphe 16). Aucune déférence n'est due envers le décideur et la Cour doit former sa propre opinion sur la question (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, au paragraphe 50).
Question en litige no 2
L'agent a-t-il manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale envers le demandeur?
[31]
Dans les demandes d'immigration, il incombe au demandeur de convaincre l'agent du bien-fondé de tous les aspects de la demande. Pour cette raison, l'équité procédurale n'exige généralement pas d'accorder aux demandeurs de permis de travail la possibilité de répondre aux préoccupations des agents. Cela est particulièrement vrai lorsque rien ne montre que les conséquences pour le demandeur seront sérieuses (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] ACF no 1098, au paragraphe 5). Les tribunaux ont conclu à l'absence de conséquences sérieuses dans des cas où les demandeurs pouvaient présenter une nouvelle demande de permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs et que rien n'indiquait que la présentation d'une nouvelle demande leur causerait des difficultés (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1563, au paragraphe 30).
[32]
Cependant, il y a des exceptions à cette règle et, dans certaines circonstances, l'obligation d'accorder aux demandeurs la possibilité de répondre est justifiée. Par exemple, lorsqu'un agent utilise une preuve extrinsèque pour se former une opinion ou tirer des conclusions subjectives, et que le demandeur ne pouvait savoir que cette preuve serait utilisée de manière défavorable, l'agent peut être tenu d'accorder au demandeur la possibilité de répondre (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 1625, au paragraphe 36; et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> précité, au paragraphe 23).
[33]
Dans la jurisprudence relative aux demandes de permis au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés, il a également été statué que, lorsque l'agent a des doutes quant à la véracité des documents, l'équité procédurale exige qu'il demande des renseignements supplémentaires (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] ACF no 1779, aux paragraphes 18 et 19; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 1383, aux paragraphes 29 et 33).
[34]
Cependant, l'agent n'est généralement pas tenu d'informer un demandeur de permis au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés de ses préoccupations lorsque celles-ci sont directement liées aux exigences législatives ou réglementaires (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 23 et 24; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 771, au paragraphe 43).
[35]
Les principes susmentionnés, établis dans des causes portant sur des permis au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés, ont été repris dans la jurisprudence portant sur des demandes de permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs (voir
Singh
, ci-dessus, aux paragraphes 40 à 42).
[36]
En l'espèce, rien ne prouve que le fait de présenter une nouvelle demande entraînera des conséquences sérieuses pour le demandeur. De même, rien n'indique que l'agent avait des doutes quant à la véracité des documents, qu'il s'est fondé sur une preuve extrinsèque pour se former une opinion ou qu'il s'est formé une opinion subjective sans qu'il ait été possible pour le demandeur de savoir qu'elle jouerait contre lui.
[37]
Quoi qu'il en soit, selon la jurisprudence relative aux permis de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés, il convient de déterminer si les préoccupations de l'agent étaient directement liées aux exigences législatives ou réglementaires. Dans la négative, il était vraisemblablement nécessaire pour respecter l'équité procédurale de donner la possibilité au demandeur de répondre aux préoccupations de l'agent.
[38]
Comme cela a été mentionné plus haut, les exigences législatives en matière de demandes de permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs sont moins précises que celles qui visent les demandes de permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés. La Partie 11 du Règlement n'énonce que des exigences minimales en ce qui concerne les demandes de permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs. Le paragraphe 200(1) du Règlement prescrit à l'agent de délivrer à l'étranger un permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs si, à l'issue d'un contrôle, l'agent est convaincu qu'il a satisfait à toutes les exigences prévues à cet article.
[39]
Dans la présente espèce, le demandeur a présenté sa demande à l'extérieur du Canada et il détenait une offre d'emploi qui avait été antérieurement approuvée dans une AMT valide (l'offre d'emploi approuvée dans l'AMT). Par conséquent, en vertu du paragraphe 200(1) il n'avait qu'à établir qu'il quitterait le Canada à la fin de la période autorisée de son séjour. Aucune preuve n'a été présentée relativement à cette question et la décision de l'agent ne donne pas à penser qu'il s'agissait d'une préoccupation ayant entraîné le rejet de la demande.
[40]
Hormis ce qui précède, la réglementation ne fournit guère d'autres indications au demandeur d'un permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs quant aux exigences auxquelles il doit se conformer.
[41]
Quoi qu'il en soit, le paragraphe 200(1) du Règlement doit être interprété de concert avec le paragraphe 200(3), qui énumère les divers cas dans lesquels l'agent doit s'abstenir de délivrer un permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs. Il incombe au demandeur d'établir qu'il n'existe pas de motifs raisonnables de croire qu'il ne sera pas capable d'exercer l'emploi pour lequel le permis de travail est demandé (voir
Samuel
, ci-dessus, au paragraphe 30). La seule exception pertinente en l'espèce est celle qui est prévue à l'alinéa 200(3)
a
), lequel interdit à l'agent de délivrer un permis au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs si « l'agent a des motifs raisonnables de croire que l'étranger est incapable d'exercer l'emploi pour lequel le permis de travail est demandé ».
[42]
En l'espèce, l'agent a conclu ce qui suit:
[traduction] Le sujet n'a pas démontré qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences relatives à la connaissance de l'anglais suivant l'AMT ou qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences relatives à l'expérience de travail en cuisine chinoise hakka de style indien. La lettre de l'employeur ne fait pas état des qualifications que possède le sujet.
[43]
Cependant, à l'appui de sa prétention selon laquelle il satisfaisait aux exigences en matière de compétence linguistique, le demandeur a présenté, dans sa demande, des dossiers scolaires montrant qu'il avait obtenu les notes de passage en anglais. L'agent a néanmoins conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences relatives à la connaissance de l'anglais [traduction] « suivant l'AMT ». Il était simplement déclaré dans l'AMT que l'emploi requérait la connaissance de l'anglais écrit et oral. De plus, comme cela a été mentionné ci-dessus, contrairement à la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés, aucun niveau d'études n'est précisé dans le Règlement en ce qui concerne les permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs. Bien que les notes du demandeur en anglais ne soient pas élevées, aucun élément de preuve ne justifiait la conclusion qu'elles ne permettaient pas de satisfaire aux exigences énoncées dans l'AMT. De plus, rien ne donne à penser, que ce soit dans les dispositions législatives ou dans les politiques de CIC, que les dossiers scolaires ne constituent pas une preuve adéquate pour établir la compétence du demandeur en anglais.
[44]
Le demandeur a également fourni à l'appui de sa demande des lettres de recommandation et des bordereaux de paie pour démontrer son expérience de travail. Comme l'agent l'a noté, les lettres de recommandation ne mentionnent pas expressément la cuisine hakka. Cependant, il y est fait mention de manière élogieuse de l'expérience de plusieurs années du demandeur comme cuisinier et de ses compétences particulières concernant la préparation de mets asiatiques. De plus, les lettres proviennent du Golden Empire Restaurant and Bar. Par conséquent, s'il existait quelque doute sur le type de restaurant pour lequel le demandeur a travaillé en Inde, il n'était pas difficile de déterminer qu'il s'agissait probablement d'un restaurant de cuisine chinoise. Cela est en outre étayé par le fait que le demandeur détient la citoyenneté indienne, mais qu'il est d'ascendance chinoise (comme cela est indiqué dans sa demande de permis de travail).
[45]
L'agent a également déclaré que le demandeur n'avait pas établi son expérience de travail en cuisine chinoise hakka de style indien. Cependant, l'offre d'emploi approuvée dans l'AMT précise clairement que les fonctions du poste sont celles d'un cuisinier spécialisé en [traduction] « cuisine chinoise indienne / cantonaise (cuisine hakka) ».
[46]
La preuve provenant de l'employeur antérieur du demandeur, son héritage culturel et sa nationalité rendent difficile de conclure à l'existence de motifs raisonnables justifiant la conclusion de l'agent que le demandeur est incapable d'exercer l'emploi pour lequel le permis de travail est demandé.
[47]
Une comparaison des fonctions d'emploi énumérées dans l'offre d'emploi approuvée dans l'AMT avec les responsabilités et les habiletés du demandeur selon les lettres de recommandation de son employeur indien fait également ressortir des similitudes importantes:
[traduction]
1. Les responsabilités énumérées dans l'offre d'emploi approuvées dans l'AMT:
Spécialisation en cuisine chinoise indienne / cantonaise (cuisine hakka); la préparation des principales sauces et marinades pour la viande et la volaille; la cuisson et la présentation des mets et la préparation de leurs accompagnements; la préparation et la cuisson de plats et de mets individuels; la surveillance de la qualité de la nourriture et la détermination des portions.
2. La lettre de recommandation du Golden Empire Restaurant and Bar (Inde):
Chef pouvant cuisiner en toute saison, qui est particulièrement compétent dans la préparation de mets asiatiques; appelé à former des seconds cuisiniers et du personnel de cuisine subalterne; à exercer un contrôle sur la conduite et la propreté du personnel de la cuisine; à vérifier la présentation des plats avant de les servir aux clients et à répondre aux questions des clients sur les plats.
[48]
La preuve contredit également la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle la lettre de recommandation ne précisait pas clairement les compétences du demandeur.
[49]
En résumé, la preuve présentée à l'agent ainsi que les directives limitées contenues dans les dispositions législatives ayant trait au permis de travail au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs font de la présente affaire une situation dans laquelle l'équité procédurale exige que l'agent donne au demandeur la possibilité de répondre à ses préoccupations. Les agents ne sont généralement pas tenus de demander des renseignements supplémentaires lorsqu'une demande est ambiguë, mais les faits de l'espèce justifient de faire exception à la règle. Par conséquent, dans le cas qui nous occupe, le défaut de l'agent d'accorder au demandeur la possibilité de répondre à ses préoccupations a donné lieu à un manquement à l'équité procédurale envers le demandeur.
[50]
Étant donné ma conclusion sur la deuxième question en litige, il ne sera pas nécessaire que je traite de l'autre question.
[51]
En conséquence du manquement à l'équité procédurale, la décision de l'agent sera annulée et l'affaire sera renvoyée à un autre agent pour qu'il procède à un nouvel examen.
[52]
Ni l'une ni l'autre des parties ne m'a proposé de question sérieuse de portée générale à certifier.
JUGEMENT
[53]
LA COUR ORDONNE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire soit accueillie, que la décision de l'agent soit annulée et que l'affaire soit renvoyée à un autre agent pour qu'il procède à un nouvel examen.
