This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
I. Overview
[1]
Diner, J.
: Alcemeba Bautista [the Applicant] is a citizen of the Philippines bringing a judicial review for a decision rejecting her Application for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds made pursuant to subsection 25(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
(SC 2001, c 27) [IRPA].
[2]
The Applicant is a single mother who lives in Toronto with her 10-year-old Canadian daughter, Renalyn Bautista. The Applicant arrived in Canada on December 12, 1999, obtaining permanent residency status as a result of being sponsored by her former husband, from whom she separated in 2000.
[3]
In 2006, the Applicant married her current husband, a resident and citizen of the Philippines. In the course of attempting to sponsor her spouse to come to Canada, she was directed to attend an inadmissibility hearing before the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. The result of this hearing was inadmissibility to Canada pursuant to section 40(1)(a) of IRPA for misrepresenting material facts in the course of her permanent residency application with her first husband, who had been in a separate common law relationship at the time. The Removal Order that resulted was upheld by the Immigration Appeal Division and was not appealed further because of deficiencies in the application for judicial review.
[4]
An H&C Application was submitted on September 15, 2011. The H&C Application stressed the best interests of her Canadian-born daughter, Renalyn. Many of Renalyn's close personal connections live in Canada - her aunt and uncle (the Applicant's sister) and her two cousins, whom she considers siblings, live on the same floor in her building. Renalyn's grandmother (the Applicant's mother) lives in the same building and her other aunt lives in Montréal. Her biological father also lives in Toronto, whom she sees on occasion throughout the year. Renalyn visited the Philippines twice as a child, but given that she was between 2-3 years old at the time, she has no recollection of the trips. She has a rudimentary ability to speak Tagalog, but cannot read or write it.
[5]
The Applicant also emphasized her own personal and economic establishment in Canada, having lived in the country for over 12 years. Aside from her family connections mentioned above, Ms. Bautista co-owns a convenience store with her sister, owns her own cleaning business and is an active participant in her church.
[6]
Ms. Bautista's H&C application was rejected on March 5, 2012 in a decision from an immigration officer in Citizenship and Immigration Canada's Backlog Reduction Office in Niagara Falls (CIC BRO-NF). The Applicant subsequently sought Federal Court leave to judicially review the H&C refusal, which was granted on November 13, 2012. Just a few days prior to the scheduled Court hearing, the Applicant settled the matter with the Department of Justice, agreeing to a re-determination by a different officer.
[7]
On March 25, 2013, another immigration officer in the same CIC BRO-NF office issued a decision denying Ms. Bautista's second H&C application. On April 9, 2013, the Applicant filed a second Federal Court application for leave and judicial review of this new H&C decision [Decision], and that forms the basis of these Reasons.
II. Decision
[8]
The Decision denied the H&C application, finding that the Applicant's removal from Canada would not constitute unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. With regard to the Applicant, the CIC BRO-NF officer [Officer] found that her experiences as a business owner would enable her to support herself if removed to the Philippines and the businesses in Canada would be able to continue without her, and that the Applicant has family in the Philippines who would be able to assist with her transition back. The Officer concluded that while leaving Canada would be difficult for the Applicant, she had not integrated herself into Canadian society to the extent that her departure would cause unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
[9]
In assessing the best interests of the child [BIOC], the Officer found that Renalyn would be able to integrate into the Filipino school system, in spite of her lack language skills. While separation from her family may be emotionally straining, the Officer found that these relationships could be maintained electronically and through occasional visits. Furthermore, the Officer found that while the quality of medical care would not be equivalent to Canada's, the Applicant was unable to demonstrate that Renalyn had medical issues that either required treatment in Canada or same would be unavailable in the Philippines. The Officer concluded that the BIOC would not be served in the Philippines. The Officer also concluded that the decision of the Applicant to have Renalyn accompany her to the Philippines was a parental choice.
III. Issues
[10]
The Applicant raised the following issues in her written materials:
1. In rejecting the H&C, did the decision give sufficient consideration to the BIOC?
2. Did the Officer err in the assessment of the Applicant's degree of establishment?
[11]
The hearing focused on the first issue, which raises serious concerns.
IV. Submissions of the Parties
[12]
First, the Applicant submits that the Officer failed to conform to the structure of conducting a BIOC analysis. The Officer did not, as per the guidance of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  first identify the best interests of the child and then determine the harm that would ensue, and/or apply the test in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  which holds that in addition to the 2 steps above, the Officer must also determine the weight the BIOC factor plays in the ultimate balancing of factors in the application. The Applicant argues the Officer did not identify the best interests of Renalyn or balance various compelling factors in the overall analysis of the application.
[13]
Ultimately, the Applicant submits that the BIOC will not favour the removal of the parent in all but exceptional circumstances, per the jurisprudence. The Officer characterizes Renalyn's potential relocation to the Philippines as a neutral factor but does not describe why this is an exceptional case where the BIOC would favour removal of the parent. In short, while the decision describes ways in which Renalyn could adapt to life in the Philippines, it does not provide reasons as to why this would be in her best interests. The Officer also erred by couching the matter of Renalyn's relocation as a parental choice, in contradiction to the Federal Court of Appeal guidance in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that a BIOC analysis includes the hardship that a child would suffer from the decision of a child to accompany a parent abroad.
[14]
Second, the Applicant contends that the Immigration Officer did not provide a cogent analysis of the Applicant's establishment in Canada as per
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 2. The Officer spoke of the Applicant's establishment in favourable light, but then came to the conclusion that her removal would not constitute unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship without corresponding reasons.
[15]
The Respondent, on the other hand, submits that the Officer's BIOC analysis was reasonable. As stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 13, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test advocated by the Applicant is a useful, but optional, guideline. There is no formal requirement as to the words that must be used or the approach that must be followed in H&C applications, as long as the Officer was alert, alive and sensitive to the BIOC [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para. 7]. The Officer demonstrated this sensitivity by considering several factors, including Renalyn's familial circumstances and her ability to adapt to Filipino society. The Respondent submits that the Officer, unlike the Applicant contends, did not conclude that the BIOC favoured Ms. Bautista's removal from Canada when finding that, "....the codification of the principle of "best interest of a child" in the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
requires that it be given substantial weight in the assessment of an application however; it is only one of many important factors that must be considered."
[16]
As for the Officer's analysis of establishment, the Respondent reminds the Court that H&C approval is an exceptional, discretionary measure: The process is not designed to eliminate hardship inherent in being asked to leave the country, but rather unusual, undeserved and disproportionate hardship. As the decision notes, leaving family and job is not unusual, undeserved and disproportionate hardship which in this case, was a consequence of staying on in Canada without proper status.
V. Analysis
[17]
The parties agreed that the standard of review with respect to this case is one of reasonableness, and hence, whether the decision was within the range of possible outcomes and evidenced transparency, justification, and intelligibility:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[18]
While highly deferential, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test is often difficult for an applicant to meet in seeking redress, this Court finds the Applicant has done just that in this matter: the Officer made a clear error in it's the BIOC assessment, and the framework used to undertake that analysis with respect to young Renalyn.
[19]
Case law, including from all three levels of the Canadian judiciary (i.e. the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and this Court in various cases including those discussed below), speaks to the primacy of the child in any BIOC examination, assuming that adequate evidence has been provided for the Officer to look at the circumstances of the child in question. In this instance, the Applicant had provided significant evidence upon which the Officer could and should have focused in considering BIOC.
[20]
Otherwise stated, with facts such as in this case, it is the child that must, first and foremost, be considered when analyzing BIOC, rather than whether the child could adapt to life in another country, accompany parents, or otherwise fit what might be in someone else's fate. It would be exceptional for relocation to be the better solution, as Justice Evans found for the Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[5] The officer does not assess the best interests of the child in a vacuum. The officer may be presumed to know that living in Canada can offer a child many opportunities and that, as a general rule, a child living in Canada with her parent is better off than a child living in Canada without her parent. The inquiry of the officer, it seems to me, is predicated on the premise, which need not be stated in the reasons, that the officer will end up finding, absent exceptional circumstances, that the "child's best interests" factor will play in favour of the non-removal of the parent. In addition to what I would describe as this implicit premise, the officer has before her a file wherein specific reasons are alleged by a parent, by a child or, as in this case, by both, as to why non-removal of the parent is in the best interests of the child. These specific reasons, must, of course, be carefully examined by the officer.
[21]
The compelling BIOC facts of this case, as mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 20 above, which were before the Officer, are that all of Renalyn's connections are to Canada: she was born in Canada, and has spent her entire life here (over 12 years). She has grown up in close proximity to all relevant family members, including her aunts, grandmother and cousins. She has only ever attended school in Canada, and all her friends are in this country. She has no meaningful contact or relationship with her father, or other relatives that are in the Philippines. She does not speak Tagalog fluently, and it is not obvious that she would be able in her adolescent years to cope with learning a new language, school system, and culture. This is especially so, given the fact that her mother has no particular ties or income stream in the Philippines that would provide for Renalyn, as she does in Canada.
[22]
Regarding parental "choice", it was simply never a credible possibility that this single mother would abandon her daughter in Canada, no more than any responsible parent would abandon their child thousands of miles away.
[23]
The Federal Court of Appeal case law is clear that the BIOC will not favour the removal of the parent in all but exceptional circumstances (
Hawthorne,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
)
. That is not the premise or framework from which the Officer assessed this case. Rather than working from the "non-exceptional" position that would as a starting proposition, have clearly favoured Renalyn remaining in Canada with her mother, the Officer took, at best, a neutral approach by looking at whether she could overcome obstacles in returning to the Philippines. Justice Annis in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  spoke to this flaw:
[20] The officer's conclusion in the present case, which describes the best interest for the children as simply remaining with their parents, fails to differentiate the best interests of the child being removed or not from Canada. Therefore, his decision does not state any conclusion on the best interests of the child remaining or parting depending upon the face removal of the parents, which is the essence of the BIOC test.
[24]
Similarly, Justice Kane in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  found that the child's best interests was remaining with the primary caregiver. Like in the initial H&C review in this case, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Officer was considering the BIOC of a 9 year old girl (as was the case in the first H&C decision):
[69] The starting point is to identify what is the child's best interest. The officer merely stated early in his reasons that it was in the best interests of the children (which means the best interest of Rhea since the two sons were over 18) to remain with their parents. That is an odd starting point given that a nine-year-old girl would never be expected to remain in Canada alone.
[25]
It should be noted that the instant Decision contains only one brief boilerplate-type reference of "BIOC" in 6 paragraphs, with no specific reference to Renalyn, or what her best interests might be. Rather, the focus of the Decision is all about the mother, Mrs. Bautista, with scant attention to the child. As stated recently in this Court by Justice Zinn in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[16] Undoubtedly placing a child in an environment where his or her basic needs are not met can never be said to be in that child's best interest. However, to suggest that the child's interest in remaining in Canada is balanced if the alternative provides a minimum standard of living is perverse. This approach completely fails to ask the question the Officer is mandated to ask: What is in this child's best interest? The Officer was required to first determine whether it was in Leticia's best interests to go with her parents to Brazil, where she had never been before, or for her to remain in Canada where she had "better social and economic opportunities." Only once he had clearly articulated what was in Leticia's best interest could the Officer then weigh this against the other positive and negative elements in the H&C application.
[26]
Had the Applicant been the sole protagonist in the litigation before this Court, then the matter would be reviewed on an entirely different basis, and through an entirely different lens. However, the case law, the policy, and subsection 25(1) itself, all dictate that one has to pay equally close, if not more attention, to the young lives impacted in an H&C analysis. Children, amongst society's most vulnerable citizens, cannot be said to be minor players on the immigration stage: their destiny must necessarily be front and center in any H&C analysis, so that they too are key protagonists in H&C applications. This Court has often held that officers must be "alert, alive and sensitive" to the BIOC. As Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dubé wrote in
Baker
, where the decision below was deemed unreasonable because the Officer failed to be alert, alive and sensitive to the BIOC:
The officer was completely dismissive of the interests of Ms. Baker's children. As I will outline in detail in the paragraphs that follow, I believe that the failure to give serious weight and consideration to the interests of the children constitutes an unreasonable exercise of the discretion conferred by the section, notwithstanding the important deference that should be given to the decision of the immigration officer.
...
... for the exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness, the decision-maker should consider children's best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them. That is not to say that children's best interests must always outweigh other considerations, or that there will not be other reasons for denying an H & C claim even when children's interests are given this consideration. However, where the interests of children are minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister's guidelines, the decision will be unreasonable. [
Baker
at paras. 65 and 75].
[27]
Another decision of this Court encapsulated this requirement to view the H&C through the child's lens, when the late Justice Blanchard found in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 30:
[...]
Where the Minister purports to remove from Canada a person who has dependent children, the Minister cannot ignore the fact that the practical consequence of her decision is to deprive the children of the benefit of subsection 4(2) of the
Act
. In those circumstances, is it not up to the Minister to rebut the conclusion that the presence of the children is a humanitarian factor justifying the exercise of discretion? Nothing in
Baker
would make such a presumption irrebuttable. No state can consistently excuse the misconduct of adults because of the effects on their children without creating a climate of irresponsibility both as to the adults' conduct and as to the motives for having children. But the rebuttal must be based upon facts in relation to the parent which would weigh more heavily in the balance than the dependency of the children upon the parent and their statutory, if not constitutional right, to remain in Canada. The bald statement that the presence of the children is the result of a parental choice does not amount to rebuttal.
[28]
To see everything through the lens of whether one reasonably can overcome the inevitable hardships that accompany a new life, as the Officer did in this case, resembles the H&C test that is applied to adults. Children are malleable - far more so than adults - and starting with the question of whether they can adapt will almost invariably predetermine the outcome of the script, namely that the child will indeed overcome the normal hardships of departure, and adjust to a new life, including learning a brand new language (Tagalog in this case). Undertaking the analysis through this lens renders the requirement to take into account the best interests of a child directly affected, as statutorily required in subsection 25(1) devoid of any meaning.
[29]
As the Court of Appeal state in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[5] An immigration officer considering an H & C application must be "alert, alive and sensitive" to, and must not "minimize", the best interests of children who may be adversely affected by a parent's deportation:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 75. However, this duty only arises when it is sufficiently clear from the material submitted to the decision maker that an application relies on this factor, at least in part. Moreover, an applicant has the burden of adducing proof of any claim on which the H & C application relies. Hence, if an applicant provides no evidence to support the claim, the officer may conclude that it is baseless.
[30]
The Officer in the present case had plenty of evidence about the impact of moving on the child herself, and failed to conduct an appropriate analysis given all the case law cited above, precisely by either failing to consider, and/or misunderstanding that which was relevant to the analysis of BIOC (see, for instance, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above at para. 47).
[31]
The conclusion on issue # 1 is that in rejecting the H&C, the Officer failed to give sufficient consideration to BIOC and the decision was therefore unreasonable.
[32]
Having found the first issue (BIOC) to be determinative, and having focused on that issue at the hearing, there is no need to rule on the second issue challenged by the Applicant (establishment).
[33]
Finally, it should be noted that the Court's judicial resources should be reserved to litigate serious matters, as they arise. In this case, a judicial review of the first (March 2012) H&C decision was proceeding to litigation in this Court but was then settled approximately a week before the hearing, after the expenditure of significant preparation, lawyer time, court resources, and anxiety for the Applicant and her family. One would have expected that to result in a new H&C decision that acknowledged the settlement, rather than what is essentially a repetition of the earlier H&C decision in March 2013 a year later. The parties and Court once again went through all the preparatory stages and hearing for this judicial review in order to correct errors in the Officer's approach to BIOC, that due to the file history were, in the Court's view, entirely avoidable. As the Applicant states in her Affidavit:
31. I was very happy to reach a settlement with the Department of Justice. But at the same time, I was upset that they had waited until a week before my judicial review hearing and after I had spent thousands of dollars to admit their mistake. Unlike the Department of Justice, I am a single mother who does not have large sums of money to engage in litigation for its own sake. Nevertheless, the Department of Justice required that I not seek any costs against the respondent as a condition of the settlement. Accordingly, I felt I had no choice but to agree.[Applicant's Record, pp. 24-25]
[34]
It is for this reason that the Court deems it fit to endorse the Cost Order agreed to by the parties which reflects the special circumstances of this case. The Costs are nominal, to acknowledge that this is still an application that by definition involves an exemption from the normal requirements of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[35]
It is the Court's sincere hope that the new Officer assigned to the matter properly considers the issue of BIOC, which has not been properly considered to date.
[36]
Neither party suggested any question for certification, nor is there any question deserving of certification.
JUDGMENT
[37]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The judicial review is allowed and the matter is returned for reconsideration by a new Officer;
2. Costs are awarded to the Applicant on consent of the parties, as set out in the Order dated October 8, 2014;
3. There will be no question certified in this matter.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Diner
[Traduction]: Alcemeba Bautista [la demanderesse], citoyenne des Philippines, demande un contrôle judiciaire relativement à la décision de rejeter sa demande de résidence permanente pour considérations d'ordre humanitaire [CH], présentée en vertu du paragraphe 25(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
(LC 2001, ch 27) [la LIPR].
[2]
Mère célibataire, la demanderesse habite Toronto avec sa fille de 10 ans née au Canada, Renalyn Bautista. Arrivée au Canada le 12 décembre 1999, la demanderesse a obtenu la résidence permanente grâce au parrainage de son conjoint d'alors, de qui elle s'est séparée en 2000.
[3]
La demanderesse a épousé en 2006 son conjoint actuel, résident et citoyen des Philippines. Dans sa tentative de le parrainer pour l'emmener au Canada, elle a dû comparaître à une enquête de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada, Section de l'immigration. Cette enquête a conclu à l'interdiction de territoire au Canada pour cause de présentations erronées sur des faits importants, en vertu de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la LIPR, dans sa demande de résidence permanente avec son premier conjoint, qui avait une union de fait avec quelqu'un d'autre à l'époque. Maintenue par la Section d'appel de l'immigration, la mesure de renvoi qui s'en est suivie n'a plus été portée en appel, vu certaines faiblesses dans la demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[4]
Le 15 septembre 2011, une demande CH a été déposée insistant sur l'intérêt supérieur de la fille de la demanderessse née au Canada, Renalyn. Un grand nombre de proches de Renalyn habitent au Canada; son oncle et sa tante (sœur de la demanderesse) et ses deux cousins, qui sont comme des frères ou des sœurs pour elle, demeurent au même étage qu'elle; sa grand-mère (mère de la demanderesse) habite le même immeuble, tandis que son autre tante demeure à Montréal. Renalyn voit à l'occasion durant l'année son père, qui habite à Toronto. Elle a visité les Philippines deux fois dans son enfance, mais elle ne s'en souvient pas puisqu'elle n'avait que deux ou trois ans à l'époque. Renalyn possède des bases en tagalog, mais elle ne sait ni lire ni écrire cette langue.
[5]
La demanderesse a insisté aussi sur son propre établissement personnel et économique au Canada (elle habite au pays depuis plus de 12 ans). Outre les parents susmentionnés, Mme Bautista est copropriétaire d'un dépanneur avec sa sœur; elle possède sa propre entreprise de nettoyage, en plus de s'impliquer activement dans sa paroisse.
[6]
Après que sa demande CH a été rejetée le 5 mars 2012 par un agent du Bureau de réduction de l'arriéré de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada à Niagara Falls (CIC BRA-NF), Mme Bautista a présenté une demande d'autorisation de contrôle judiciaire à la Cour fédérale, qui lui a été accordée le 13 novembre 2012. Quelques jours à peine avant l'audience toutefois, elle s'est entendue avec le ministère de la Justice, acceptant qu'un agent différent se livre à un nouvel examen.
[7]
Le 25 mars 2013, un autre agent du même CIC BRA-NF a rejeté la deuxième demande CH de Mme Bautista; cette dernière a déposé en Cour fédérale, le 9 avril 2013, une deuxième demande d'autorisation de contrôle judiciaire de cette nouvelle décision CH ( « la décision »), et tel est le fondement des présents motifs.
II.
La décision
[8]
L'agent a décidé de rejeter la demande CH après avoir conclu que le renvoi de la demanderesse du Canada ne lui occasionnerait pas de difficultés injustifiées, inhabituelles et excessives. L'agent du CIC BRA-NF [ « l'agent »] a conclu que l'expérience de la demanderesse en tant que propriétaire d'entreprise lui permettra de gagner sa vie après un renvoi, que ses entreprises au Canada peuvent survivre sans elle, et que sa famille aux Philippines saura l'aider dans sa transition; il conclut que, même s'il lui sera difficile de quitter le Canada, la demanderesse n'est pas assez intégrée à la société canadienne pour que son départ lui cause des difficultés injustifiées, inhabituelles ou excessives.
[9]
Quant à l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant [l'ISE], l'agent a jugé que la connaissance limitée de Renlyn ne l'empêchera pas d'intégrer le système scolaire philippin et que, malgré la difficulté émotionnelle de la séparation, moyens électroniques et visites occasionnelles lui permettront de garder le contact avec sa famille. Tout en admettant que les soins de santé n'ont pas la même qualité aux Philippines qu'au Canada, l'agent a conclu que la demanderesse n'a pas été en mesure de prouver, ni que Renalyn avait des problèmes de santé qui réclament un traitement au Canada, ni que ces traitements n'existent pas aux Philippines. Selon l'agent, aller dans ce pays ne sert pas l'ISE, et la décision d'y emmener Renalyn constitue un choix parental de la mère.
III.
Questions en litige
[10]
La demanderesse soulève les points suivants dans ses documents écrits:
1. La décision de rejeter la demande CH tient-elle suffisamment compte de l'ISE?
2. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur dans son appréciation du degré d'établissement de la demanderesse?
[11]
L'audience a porté principalement sur le premier point, qui soulève de grandes inquiétudes.
IV.
Arguments des parties
[12]
La demanderesse affirme premièrement que l'Agent n'a pas respecté la structure des analyses d'ISE: il aurait négligé les directives de la Cour d'appel fédérale dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  selon lesquelles on doit d'abord définir l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, et ensuite seulement établir les difficultés que vivrait l'enfant ou appliquer le critère décrit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (voir la décision 2012 CF 166) selon lequel outre les deux étapes susmentionnées, l'agent doit déterminer le poids à accorder à l'ISE au moment d'équilibrer définitivement les facteurs évalués dans le cadre de la demande. Selon la demanderesse, l'agent n'a pas défini l'intérêt supérieur de Renalyn, et son analyse globale ne met pas en balance les divers facteurs décisifs de la demande.
[13]
En définitive, la demanderesse affirme que l'ISE ne penche en faveur du renvoi du parent que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles selon la jurisprudence. L'agent qualifie de facteur neutre le déménagement possible de Renalyn aux Philippines, mais sans expliquer ce qui rend les circonstances exceptionnelles pour favoriser le renvoi du parent. En résumé, la décision décrit comment la fille pourra s'adapter à la vie aux Philippines, mais elle n'explique pas pourquoi tel serait son intérêt supérieur. L'agent a commis une erreur en présentant le déménagement de Renalyn comme un choix parental, car les directives de la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> veulent au contraire qu'une analyse de l'ISE englobe les difficultés auxquelles s'exposerait l'enfant dans la décision d'accompagner son parent à l'étranger.
[14]
Deuxièmement, la demanderesse fait valoir que l'agent d'immigration n'a pas analysé son établissement au Canada de façon réaliste au sens de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragr. 2; il en a parlé en termes favorables, pour ensuite conclure sans raison à l'appui que son renvoi n'occasionnerait pas de difficultés injustifiées, inhabituelles ou excessives.
[15]
Pour sa part, le défendeur qualifie de raisonnable l'analyse d'ISE de l'agent. Comme il est indiqué dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragr. 13, le critère établi dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> préconisé par la demanderesse est une ligne directrice utile, mais facultative. Aucune exigence officielle ne définit les mots à employer ni l'approche à suivre dans les demandes CH, pour peu que l'agent soit réceptif, attentif et sensible à l'ISE [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragr. 7]. Ici, l'agent se serait montré sensible en soupesant plusieurs facteurs dont la situation familiale de Renalyn et sa capacité de s'adapter à la société philippine. Contrairement à ce que prétend la demanderesse, l'agent n'a pas conclu que l'ISE penchait en faveur du renvoi de Mme Bautista quand il a affirmé que [traduction] « même si la codification du principe de "l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant" dans la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
lui donne beaucoup de poids dans l'évaluation d'une demande, celui-ci n'est qu'un des nombreux facteurs importants à examiner ».
[16]
Quant à l'analyse relative à l'établissement, le défendeur rappelle à la Cour que la résidence permanente accordée pour CH est une mesure discrétionnaire et exceptionnelle, un processus conçu pour éliminer non pas toutes les difficultés inhérentes à un renvoi, mais seulement les difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives. La décision fait ressortir que le fait de quitter sa famille et son emploi n'entraîne pas des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées et excessives, et que la présente affaire découle du fait que la demanderesse est demeurée au Canada sans statut adéquat.

Analyse
[17]
Selon les parties, la norme de contrôle judiciaire en l'espèce est celle de la raisonnabilité et, par conséquent, il faut se demander si la décision est transparente, justifiée et intelligible et si elle fait partie des issues possibles à la lumière de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[18]
Empreint d'une grande déférence, le critère établi dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> est souvent difficile à remplir pour qui veut obtenir une réparation. Pourtant, la présente Cour juge que la demanderesse y est très bien parvenue dans l'affaire qui nous intéresse: l'agent a fait une erreur flagrante, autant dans l'analyse d'ISE elle-même que dans le choix du cadre retenu pour l'effectuer à l'endroit de la jeune Renalyn.
[19]
Des décisions des trois instances judiciaires canadiennes (la Cour suprême du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , et la Cour fédérale dans plusieurs affaires dont celles discutées ci-dessous) évoquent la primauté de l'enfant dans toute analyse d'ISE, pour peu que l'agent ait assez d'éléments de preuve pour apprécier la situation de l'enfant. En l'espèce, la demanderesse avait fourni une abondance de preuves révélant que l'agent aurait pu, et même dû, examiner.
[20]
Autrement dit, quand une affaire s'apparente à celle-ci au plan factuel, l'analyse d'ISE doit s'intéresser d'abord à l'enfant lui-même, et non pas à la possibilité qu'il s'adapte à la vie dans un autre pays, qu'il accompagne ses parents, ou qu'il suive une autre personne dans ce qui lui arrive. Le déménagement ne s'avère la meilleure solution que dans les cas exceptionnels, comme le dit le juge Evans de la Cour d'appel dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[5] L'agente n'examine pas l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant dans l'abstrait. Elle peut être réputée savoir que la vie au Canada peut offrir à un enfant un éventail de possibilités et que, règle générale, un enfant qui vit au Canada avec son parent se trouve dans une meilleure position qu'un enfant vivant au Canada sans son parent. À mon sens, l'examen de l'agente repose sur la prémisse - qu'elle n'a pas à exposer dans ses motifs - qu'elle constatera en bout de ligne, en l'absence de circonstances exceptionnelles, que le facteur de « l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant » penchera en faveur du non-renvoi du parent. Outre cette prémisse que je qualifierais d'implicite, il faut se rappeler que l'agente est saisie d'un dossier particulier dans lequel un parent, un enfant ou les deux, comme en l'occurrence, allèguent des raisons précises quant à savoir pourquoi le non-renvoi du parent est dans l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant. Il va de soi que l'agente doit examiner attentivement ces raisons précises.
[21]
Les faits probants concernant l'ISE dans la présente affaire, mentionnés aux paragraphes 4 et 20 ci-dessus), dont a été saisi l'agent, représentent tous les liens de Renalyn au Canada: elle est née ici, elle y a passé toute sa vie (soit plus de 12 ans). Elle a grandi en présence de toute sa famille proche: tantes, grand-mère, cousins, etc. Tous ses amis se trouvent au Canada, et c'est ici qu'elle a fait toute sa scolarité. Elle n'a pas de relation véritable avec son père ni avec aucun autre parent aux Philippines. Renalyn ne maîtrise pas le tagalog, et il n'est pas évident qu'en pleine adolescence elle supporterait de devoir apprendre à la fois une nouvelle langue, un nouveau système scolaire et une nouvelle culture. D'autant plus que sa mère n'a pas aux Philippines le revenu ni les relations dont elle dispose au Canada pour l'entretenir.
[22]
Quant au « choix » parental, il n'a jamais été envisageable qu'une mère célibataire comme Mme Bautista abandonne sa fille au Canada. Aucun parent responsable n'abandonnerait son enfant à des milliers de kilomètres.
[23]
La jurisprudence de la Cour d'appel fédérale montre clairement que, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, jamais l'ISE ne penche en faveur du renvoi du parent (
Hawthorne, Kisana,
ci-dessus). Or en l'espèce, tel n'a pas été le principe ou cadre de base de l'agent. Plutôt que de supposer une non-exception qui d'emblée aurait favorisé le maintien de Renalyn au Canada avec sa mère, l'Agent a opté pour une approche qu'on pourrait au mieux qualifier de neutre en se demandant si elle pourrait surmonter les obstacles d'un retour aux Philippines. C'est là une faiblesse dont le juge Annis a parlé dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[20] En l'espèce, la conclusion de l'agent, selon laquelle il serait dans l'intérêt supérieur des enfants de simplement demeurer avec leurs parents, n'établit aucune distinction au chapitre de l'intérêt supérieur entre le renvoi ou le non-renvoi du Canada. Par conséquent, sa décision ne tire aucune conclusion sur l'intérêt supérieur des enfants selon qu'ils restent au Canada ou qu'ils quittent le pays au renvoi des parents, ce qui constitue l'essence du critère de l'ISE.
[24]
De même, la juge Kane statue dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  que l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant consiste à demeurer avec son principal dispensateur de soins. L'agent dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a examiné l'ISE d'une petite fille de neuf ans, âge que Renalyn avait au moment de la première décision CH en l'espèce.
[69] Le point de départ consiste à se demander en quoi consiste l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant. L'agent s'est contenté, au début de ses motifs, de déclarer qu'il était dans l'intérêt supérieur des enfants (c.-à-d., l'intérêt supérieur de Rhea, étant donné que les deux fils avaient plus de 18 ans) de demeurer avec leurs parents. Ce point de départ est un peu étrange, étant donné qu'on ne peut s'attendre à ce qu'une fille de neuf ans demeure seule au Canada.
[25]
Il faut noter que la décision en l'espèce n'aborde l'ISE que de la façon la plus élémentaire en six paragraphes à peine, sans mentionner Renalyn explicitement ni préciser où se trouve son intérêt supérieur. La décision porte principalement sur la mère, Mme Bautista; on pourrait dire qu'elle oublie complètement la fille, ou presque. Comme l'a écrit récemment le juge Zinn de notre Cour dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[16] Il ne fait aucun doute qu'on ne pourra jamais prétendre qu'il est dans l'intérêt supérieur d'un enfant de le placer dans un milieu où ses besoins fondamentaux ne sont pas comblés. Cependant, laisser entendre que l'intérêt de l'enfant à demeurer au Canada est neutralisé si l'autre pays offre un niveau de vie minimal est abusif. Cette approche escamote complètement la question à laquelle l'agent est chargé de répondre: Quel est l'intérêt supérieur de cet enfant? L'agent était tenu de décider en premier lieu s'il était dans l'intérêt supérieur de Leticia d'aller avec ses parents au Brésil, où elle n'avait jamais mis les pieds, ou plutôt de demeurer au Canada, où elle bénéficiait de [traduction] « meilleures possibilités sur le plan social et financier ». Ce n'est qu'après avoir clairement défini ce qui était dans l'intérêt supérieur de Leticia que l'agent pouvait apprécier ce résultat en tenant compte des autres éléments favorables et défavorables que révèle la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire.
[26]
Si la demanderesse avait été la seule protagoniste en l'espèce, l'affaire aurait été examinée selon des critères et un point de vue bien différents. Or, autant la jurisprudence que les politiques et le paragraphe 25(1) lui-même nous indiquent qu'une analyse CH doit s'intéresser autant, sinon plus, aux jeunes vies que la décision va influencer. Puisque les enfants comptent parmi les citoyens les plus vulnérables d'une société, les instances d'immigration ne sauraient les reléguer au second plan. Leur avenir doit nécessairement occuper le devant de la scène, de manière à ce qu'ils soient eux aussi des protagonistes clés dans les demandes CH. La présente Cour a souvent statué que les agents devaient se montrer « réceptifs, attentifs et sensibles » à l'ISE. Dans l'affaire
Baker
, Madame la juge L'Heureux-Dubé a qualifié la décision de déraisonnable justement parce que tel n'avait pas été le cas.
L'agent n'a prêté aucune attention à l'intérêt des enfants de Mme Baker. Comme je le démontrerai avec plus de détails dans les paragraphes qui suivent, j'estime que le défaut d'accorder de l'importance et de la considération à l'intérêt des enfants constitue un exercice déraisonnable du pouvoir discrétionnaire conféré par l'article, même s'il faut exercer un degré élevé de retenue envers la décision de l'agent d'immigration.
...
... pour que l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire respecte la norme du caractère raisonnable, le décideur devrait considérer l'intérêt supérieur des enfants comme un facteur important, lui accorder un poids considérable, et être réceptif, attentif et sensible à cet intérêt. Cela ne veut pas dire que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants l'emportera toujours sur d'autres considérations, ni qu'il n'y aura pas d'autres raisons de rejeter une demande d'ordre humanitaire même en tenant compte de l'intérêt des enfants. Toutefois, quand l'intérêt des enfants est minimisé, d'une manière incompatible avec la tradition humanitaire du Canada et les directives du ministre, la décision est déraisonnable. [
Baker
, paragr. 65 et 75].
[27]
Une autre décision de notre Cour résume l'impératif de se placer du point de vue l'enfant lorsqu'on examine une demande CH. Le regretté juge Blanchard a statué dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragr. 30:
[...]
Lorsqu'il s'apprête à renvoyer du Canada une personne qui a des enfants à sa charge, le ministre ne peut ignorer le fait qu'une des conséquences pratiques de sa décision est de priver les enfants des avantages que comporte le paragraphe 4(2) de la Loi. Dans ces conditions, n'est-ce pas au ministre qu'il appartient de réfuter la conclusion que la présence des enfants constitue un facteur d'ordre humanitaire qui justifie l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire? Il n'y a rien dans l'arrêt Baker qui rendrait cette présomption irréfutable. Aucun État ne peut systématiquement excuser en raison de conséquences sur leurs enfants la mauvaise conduite d'adultes sans créer un climat d'irresponsabilité tant en ce qui a trait à la conduite des adultes qu'aux mobiles qui les ont poussés à avoir des enfants. Mais la réfutation doit être fondée sur des faits qui concernent le père ou la mère qui pèseraient plus lourd dans la balance que la dépendance des enfants envers leurs parents et que leur droit légal, voire constitutionnel, de demeurer au Canada. La vague affirmation que la présence des enfants au Canada est le résultat du choix des parents ne saurait être considérée comme une réfutation.
[28]
Tout résumer à la question de savoir si l'on peut raisonnablement s'attendre à ce que la personne surmonte les inévitables difficultés d'une nouvelle vie, comme l'agent l'a fait en l'espèce, ressemble plutôt au critère qu'on applique pour les adultes. Puisque les enfants sont beaucoup plus malléables que les adultes, quiconque se pose au départ la question de savoir s'ils vont pouvoir s'adapter aboutira presque inévitablement à une conclusion affirmative comme quoi les enfants parviendront effectivement à surmonter les difficultés inhérentes au départ pour ensuite s'adapter à une nouvelle vie, avec entre autres l'apprentissage d'une toute nouvelle langue (le tagalog dans le cas présent). Procéder ainsi, c'est vider de son sens l'obligation de prendre en compte l'intérêt supérieur des enfants directement touchés, comme le veut pourtant le paragraphe 25(1).
[29]
On peut lire ce qui suit dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  de la Cour d'appel fédérale:
[5] L'agent d'immigration qui examine une demande pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire doit être « réceptif, attentif et sensible » à l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, sur lesquels l'expulsion du père ou de la mère peut avoir des conséquences préjudiciables, et il ne doit pas « minimiser » cet intérêt:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 75. Toutefois, l'obligation n'existe que lorsqu'il apparaît suffisamment clairement des documents qui ont été soumis au décideur, qu'une demande repose, du moins en partie, sur ce facteur. De surcroît, le demandeur a le fardeau de prouver toute allégation sur laquelle il fonde sa demande pour des raisons humanitaires. Par voie de conséquence, si un demandeur ne soumet aucune preuve à l'appui de son allégation, l'agent est en droit de conclure qu'elle n'est pas fondée.
[30]
Dans l'affaire qui nous intéresse, l'agent ne manquait pas de preuves pour lui démontrer les conséquences du déménagement sur l'enfant elle-même, mais il n'a pas su faire une analyse convenable au regard de toute la jurisprudence citée plus haut, c'est-à-dire comprendre et prendre en compte ce qui était pertinent pour l'analyse de l'ISE (voir par exemple <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ci-dessus, par. 47).
[31]
La conclusion à la question no 1 est que par son rejet de la demande CH, l'agent n'a pas tenu suffisamment compte de l'ISE, et que la décision était donc déraisonnable.
[32]
Puisque la première question (l'ISE) s'est avérée décisive et que je me suis concentré sur elle à l'audience, il n'est nul besoin de statuer sur la deuxième question soulevée par la demanderesse (l'établissement).
[33]
Soulignons finalement que la Cour devrait réserver ses ressources judiciaires aux affaires sérieuses au fur et à mesure qu'elles se présentent. En l'espèce, le contrôle judiciaire de la première décision CH (celle de mars 2012) s'est réglé une semaine environ avant l'audience, même si notre tribunal avait déjà consacré beaucoup de préparation, d'heures (pour ses avocats) et de ressources judiciaires, tout cela sans compter l'anxiété qu'ont vécue la demanderesse et sa famille. Dans les circonstances, on aurait pu s'attendre à ce que la nouvelle décision CH un an plus tard (mars 2013) aille dans le sens du règlement plutôt que de réitérer en substance la première décision. Les parties et la Cour ont répété toutes les étapes préparatoires de même que l'audience relative au contrôle judiciaire pour corriger dans le traitement de l'ISE par l'agent des erreurs qui, selon la Cour, étaient parfaitement évitables dans les circonstances. Comme la demanderesse l'indique dans son affidavit [traduction]:
31. J'étais très contente d'avoir pu m'entendre avec le ministère de la Justice, mais en même temps, je m'indigne qu'il ait attendu jusqu'à une semaine avant mon audience en contrôle judiciaire, après que j'aie dépensé des milliers de dollars, pour admettre son erreur. Contrairement au ministère de la Justice, une mère célibataire comme moi n'a pas les moyens de s'engager dans des litiges comme fin en soi. Mais malgré cela, le Ministère a stipulé comme condition que je ne devrais pas chercher à me faire dédommager par le défendeur. J'ai donc senti que je n'avais pas le choix d'accepter. [Dossier de la demanderesse, pp. 24-25]
[34]
Pour cette raison, la Cour juge bon d'accepter l'ordonnance relative aux dépens dont les parties ont convenu, et qui témoigne des circonstances particulières de l'espèce. Les coûts sont symboliques; ils visent à rappeler que la demande est par définition exemptée des exigences habituelles de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[35]
La Cour espère sincèrement que le nouvel agent qui sera chargé de la présente affaire donnera à l'ISE la considération qu'il mérite, ce qui n'a pas été le cas jusqu'à maintenant.
[36]
Aucune des parties n'a proposé de question aux fins de certification et aucune question ne sera certifiée.
