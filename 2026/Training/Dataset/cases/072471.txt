INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of a Visa Officer (Officer) of the Canadian High Commission, Colombo, Sri Lanka, dated 16 February 2012 and reconsidered 28 June 2012 (Decision), which found that the Applicant does not meet the definition of a dependant child as described in section 2(b) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-27 (Regulations).
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who was born on 21 February 1982. In 2011, the Applicant's mother submitted an application for permanent residence in Canada which included the Applicant as a dependent child. While the Applicant was over the age of 22 years at the time of the application, her mother stated in her application that the Applicant was enrolled as a full-time student at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna, since the age of 21.
[3]
By letter dated 6 December 2011, the Officer notified the Applicant that she did not fall into the definition of a dependent child as stated in section 2 of the Regulations. By letter dated 24 December 2011, the Applicant's mother submitted a letter to the Officer stating that the Applicant had been enrolled as a full time student since 29 December 2003.
[4]
On 16 February 2012, the Officer informed the Applicant by way of letter that she was found not to meet the definition of a dependent child. On 23 March 2012, the Applicant's counsel submitted further supporting documentation. This included the Applicant's student card and a letter confirming the Applicant's enrolment from 29 December 2003 until 9 December 2010 in the Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna. Another letter certified that the Applicant's final examination for her degree was held in December, 2010.
[5]
The Officer considered the Applicant's submissions and communicated by way of email dated 28 June 2012 that she would remain excluded from her mother's application.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[6]
According to the Applicant, the Decision under review in this application consists of the Exclusion Letter dated 16 February 2012 and the Officer's Global Case Management Systems (GCMS) Notes. There is also the Officer's email dated 28 June 2012, which informed the Applicant that her request for reconsideration had been refused.
[7]
By entry into the Notes on 2 December 2011, the Officer stated that the Applicant had provided a letter from the University of Jaffna indicating that she was a final year medical student in 2010, but nothing to show that she was still enrolled. The Officer was not satisfied that the Applicant met the definition of "dependent" for continuous enrolment at a recognized educational institution and indicated that a letter should be drafted giving the Applicant 30 days to respond to these concerns. The Notes indicate that a letter was sent to the Applicant in this regard on 6 December 2011.
[8]
The Notes indicated that further documentation was received on 10 January 2012. Again the Officer noted that there was nothing to indicate the Applicant was a student beyond December, 2010. In the Notes dated 7 February 2012, the Officer said that the Applicant has "submitted evidence of Clinical Clerkships but these have no dates past 2008 and appear to be internships." The Officer noted that the Applicant submitted a letter from the University of Jaffna indicating that "she was a final year medical student in 2010 but nothing to show that she is still enrolled." The Officer was not satisfied the Applicant met the definition of "dependent."
[9]
The Exclusion Letter was sent on 16 February 2012. On 3 April 2012, the Notes indicated that a letter was received from the Applicant's consultant on 22 March 2012. The Officer reviewed the Applicant's materials again, and found that the Applicant's student record ended in December, 2010. As such, the Applicant did not fall into the category of dependent child. The Officer further noted that there were not enough humanitarian and compassionate factors to overcome the Applicant' ineligibility. The Officer concluded that there was no requirement to respond to the Applicant's representative, and that the original exclusion stood.
[10]
The Officer notified the Applicant that her reconsideration request was denied on 28 June 2012.
ISSUES
[11]
The Applicant raises the following issue in this application:
a. Whether the Officer breached the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness by failing to consider and respond to the Applicant's submissions of 23 March 2012 regarding her status as a dependent child within her mother's permanent residence application.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[12]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[13]
The Applicant raises an issue of procedural fairness. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 100, "it is for the courts, not the Minister, to provide the legal answer to procedural fairness questions." Accordingly, the standard of review applicable is correctness.
[14]
The Respondent submits that it is the reconsideration decision that is under review in this application, and that reconsideration is an exercise in discretion that is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[15]
In her arguments, the Applicant also takes issue with the adequacy of the Officer's reasons. In
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Newfoundland Nurses
], the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 14 that the adequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision. Rather, "the reasons must be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes." Thus, any issue that may arise as to the adequacy of reasons will be considered in a context of the reasonableness of the Decision.
[16]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."

ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
[18]
The Applicant points out that her mother responded to the concerns of the Officer by sending in additional submissions on 24 December 2011. The Officer's entry in the Notes on 10 January 2012 indicates that the Applicant's mother did provide further documentation, but there is no indication that the Officer responded to these submissions. The entry from 7 February 2012 simply states that the Officer remains "unsatisfied" with the evidence.
[19]
The Applicant says that the Officer raises many questions in the entry of 7 February 2012 to do with the Applicant's schooling and dates of study, but the Applicant was never confronted with these questions. Had she been, she would have been able to provide an explanation. The Applicant provided information that her Clinical Clerkships were part of her Faculty of Medicine curriculum, but the Officer simply states that they "appear to be internships." The Applicant submits that this was sheer speculation, and the Officer did not confront her with these concerns as was required in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[20]
Further, on 23 March 2012 the Applicant's lawyer in Toronto prepared further supporting documentation to be sent to Colombo, receipt of which was confirmed. The Notes simply state that an email was received from the Applicant's consultant on 3 April 2012, which is incorrect as there was no email from the Applicant's solicitor sent in April, 2012. There was only the letter and submissions sent on 23 March 2012, and an email sent on 12 June 2012 requesting a response to the 23 March 2012 submissions.
[21]
The Applicant submits that the Officer essentially failed to communicate with the Applicant's mother or her solicitor in regards to the December, 2011 and March, 2012 submissions. The duty of fairness requires officers to inform applicants of their concerns so that an applicant may have a chance to "disabuse" an officer of such concerns (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Where the issue of a foreign national's admissibility to Canada is at stake, as well as the separation of a family, the applicant ought to be given a full and fair opportunity to respond (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
CIC's Operational Manual ENF2/OP18,
Evaluating Inadmissibility
, deals with how visa officers should handle cases when admissibility issues arise. In regards to procedural fairness, this document says that applicants should be able to provide a response to concerns, have their evidence fully and fairly considered, be able to receive and comment on any relevant documentation, and be advised of issues and allowed to respond. The Applicant submits that the Officer did not follow these guidelines.
[23]
The Applicant also submits that there is no actual analysis or consideration of her submissions. For example, the Officer does not consider the letter from T. Thusyanthan stating that the Applicant was enrolled full-time at the University of Jaffna. The Officer simply remains "unsatisfied" as to the Applicant's status, but provides no insight into why this is the case. If the reasons for a decision are not sufficient to allow an applicant to understand the basis on which it was decided, the decision is unreasonable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Although a visa officer is under a lesser duty to provide detailed reasons, there is still a duty to provide actual "reasons" and indicate the evidentiary basis for his or her ultimate determination and critical findings (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
The Applicant points out that the Officer did not even bother to record the Applicant's submissions of 23 March 2012, did not respond to them, and did not notify her counsel that a decision had been made months earlier. As in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Officer did not inform the Applicant of what factors were considered relevant and this constitutes a breach of natural justice.
The Respondent
[25]
The Respondent points out that in her Notice of Application, the Applicant sought leave to review the decision of 28 June 2012, that is, the Officer's reconsideration decision. A reconsideration decision is distinct from an Officer's original refusal (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[26]
The Federal Court of Appeal has made clear that when a reconsideration decision is being challenged it is not open to the Court to look behind that decision to judicially review the original decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As was said by the Court of Appeal in paragraph 3 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
For whatever reason, Mr. Williams did not seek judicial review of the Initial decision and the time limit for judicial review of that decision expired in May, 2004. Accordingly, following earlier decisions, this Court is not, during judicial review of a reconsideration decision, to review an initial decision of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.)).
[27]
The Respondent submits that the Applicant only sought leave with respect to the reconsideration decision dated 28 June 2012, and so she should not now be allowed to challenge the original decision.
[28]
The Respondent further submits that the Applicant's claim that the Officer failed to respond to her March, 2012 request is without merit. As evidenced by the email response of 28 June 2012 (Certified Tribunal Record, page 25), the Applicant was informed that the decision from February, 2012 would not be changed. The receipt of the response is also evidenced by the fact that the Applicant did not bring an application for
mandamus
, and her Notice of Application states the date the decision was rendered as being 28 June 2012.
[29]
The reconsideration request was considered on 11 April 2012, and the Applicant was notified of the result on 28 June 2012. There was no prejudice to the Applicant in not being notified as soon as the decision was made. The Applicant's argument that the decision was lacking in analysis is without merit; it is established that the Officer's GCMS Notes form part of the Decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
The Respondent points out that unlike the age of a dependent child, educational status is not "locked in" as of the date of the application for permanent residence. The Applicant is required to show that she is an eligible member of the family class as of the date of the application and the time of determination of the application (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). There was no evidence before the Officer that the Applicant was enrolled in full-time academic training past December, 2010.
[31]
In response to the letter sent to the Applicant's mother in December, 2011, she provided the Officer with a sworn letter stating that the Applicant was enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine on 20 December 2003 and that the Applicant is financially dependent on her mother. This letter does not say that the Applicant was enrolled in academic training on a full-time basis at the time the application was assessed. The letter from the University of Jaffna says that the Applicant was a student from January, 2004 until December, 2010. The Respondent submits that it is reasonable to expect that if the Applicant was still enrolled, the letter would have said so. The other documents provided by the Applicant also do not confirm that she was pursuing her studies after December, 2010.
[32]
Based on the evidence presented, the Officer reasonably concluded that the Applicant had not been attending a post-secondary institution after December, 2010. For that reason she did not meet the definition of a dependent child. The Respondent submits that there is no merit to the Applicant's allegations that the Officer breached procedural fairness.
[33]
The onus was on the Applicant to put forward all the necessary information and supporting documentation. As the Court said at paragraph 6 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
It is well established that it is the responsibility of a visa applicant to put before the officer all the material necessary for a favourable decision to be made. Hence, visa officers are under no general legal duty to ask for clarification or for additional information before rejecting a visa application on the ground that the material submitted was insufficient to satisfy the officer that the applicant had met the relevant selection criteria.
See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[34]
There was no duty on the Officer to advise the Applicant that her documentation was unsatisfactory or provide her with an opportunity to address any concerns the Officer had (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Applicant had the obligation to produce relevant documentation for the Officer. There is no obligation on a visa officer to seek additional evidence or conduct an interview when sufficient supporting material has not been included (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The onus does not shift to the Officer and there is no entitlement to a personal interview (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[35]
Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the issue of family reunification was reasonably assessed by the Officer. The Officer considered that the Applicant has family remaining in Sri Lanka, as well as in Canada, France and Australia.
ANALYSIS
[36]
It is clear from the record that the Visa Post was concerned about the dependent child issue and prepared a procedural fairness letter on this issue dated 6 December 2011. The Applicant's mother responded to the fairness letter on 16 December 2011. The GCMS entry for 4 January 2012 indicates this letter was received for review by the Visa Post.
[37]
The GCMS entry for 10 January 2012 reveals that the Applicant and her mother made further submissions. However, none of the documents and submissions from the Applicant and her mother established that the Applicant was enrolled in and attending a post-secondary institution. When the documents were reviewed on 7 February 2012, the GCMS entry shows that the visa post was still unsatisfied with the evidence submitted to establish that the Applicant was a dependent within the meaning of the Regulations. A review of that evidence clearly indicates why.
[38]
The Applicant's mother was informed of the negative Decision in a letter dated 16 February 2012. In a letter dated 23 March 2012, counsel for the Applicant made further submissions. It is difficult to know how to categorize this letter. It says that the negative decision of 16 February 2011 was wrong, but no application was made to review the decision. Read as a whole, the letter of 23 March 2012 appears to be a request for reconsideration.
[39]
The Decision under review is the refusal of the request for reconsideration dated 28 June 2012. This Decision was communicated by e-mail to the Applicant's counsel in response to his e-mail of 12 June 2012, requesting a response to counsel's submissions of 23 March 2012:
Please be advised the decision communicated to the applicant with regard to her excluded daughter by letter in February 2012 stands.
[40]
The accompanying GCMS notes indicate that the Officer considered the reconsideration request and conducted a transparent and intelligible analysis to determine whether the Applicant was a dependent at the material time. As the Respondent points out, education status is not "locked in" as of the date of the application and the Applicant has taken no issue with the Officer's decision to assess her educational status at the time of the determination itself. See
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 55-60.
[41]
It is clear from the record why the request for reconsideration was refused: none of the materials submitted by counsel on 23 March 2012 established that the Applicant was a dependent at the material time, or overcame the same difficulty found in the earlier submissions. As the GCMS notes reveal, the difficulty was that the evidence indicated that the Applicant was a student at the University of Jaffna from January 2004 until December 2010. Her university record ends in December 2010, and there was no evidence to indicate that the Applicant was continuing as a student, as per the Regulations, or that she was still enrolled in 2011. So the Officer was not satisfied that the Applicant met the definition of a "dependent" for continuous enrollment at a recognized educational institution so as to qualify as a dependent on her mother's application.
[42]
The Applicant has raised various grounds for review, but none of them stand up to scrutiny. Given the evidence before the Officer, the decision not to change the initial decision is not unreasonable. In addition, there was no procedural unfairness. The onus is upon the Applicant to provide the evidence required to establish dependency.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[43]
It is also clear from the GCMS Notes that the Officer considered the H&C factor of family reunification, but found that this factor did not overcome the Applicant's ineligibility because she had two siblings residing in Sri Lanka, as well as one in France and another in Australia. The Applicant complains that she had no opportunity to address these matters, but she could have done so in counsel's reconsideration request of 23 March 2012 and she has placed nothing before me to suggest that the Officer's assessment of the situation was inaccurate or inappropriate in any way. The Applicant submitted the same evidence for reconsideration that was submitted for the initial decision, so it is hardly likely that the request for reconsideration would succeed without providing any specifics for consideration on H&C grounds.
[44]
Counsel agree there are no questions for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[45]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.

[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), de la décision datée du 16 février 2012 et réexaminée le 28 juin 2012 (la décision) par laquelle un agent des visas (l'agent) du haut-commissariat du Canada à Colombo, au Sri Lanka, a déterminé que la demanderesse ne correspondait pas à la définition d'« enfant à charge » énoncée à l'alinéa 2
b
) du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-27 (le Règlement).
CONTEXTE
[2]
La demanderesse est une citoyenne du Sri Lanka née le 21 février 1982. En 2011, la mère de la demanderesse a présenté une demande de résidence permanente au Canada qui visait aussi la demanderesse à titre d'enfant à charge. La demanderesse avait plus de 22 ans au moment de la demande, mais sa mère a déclaré que la demanderesse étudiait à temps plein à la faculté de médecine de l'Université de Jaffna depuis l'âge de 21 ans.
[3]
Dans une lettre datée du 6 décembre 2011, l'agent a avisé la demanderesse qu'elle ne correspondait pas à la définition d'« enfant à charge » énoncée à l'article 2 du Règlement. Dans une lettre datée du 24 décembre 2011, la mère de la demanderesse a informé l'agent que la demanderesse était inscrite comme étudiante à temps plein depuis le 29 décembre 2003.
[4]
Le 16 février 2012, l'agent a informé la demanderesse par lettre qu'elle ne correspondait pas à la définition d'« enfant à charge ». Le 23 mars 2012, l'avocat de la demanderesse a fourni d'autres documents à l'appui de la demande. Ces documents comprenaient la carte d'étudiante de la demanderesse et une lettre confirmant l'inscription de la demanderesse à la faculté de médecine de l'Université de Jaffna du 29 décembre 2003 au 9 décembre 2010. Une autre lettre certifiait que la demanderesse avait passé le dernier examen pour l'obtention de son diplôme en décembre 2010.
[5]
L'agent a examiné les observations de la demanderesse et l'a informée, dans un courriel daté du 28 juin 2012, qu'elle demeurait exclue de la demande de sa mère.
DÉCISION FAISANT L'OBJET DU CONTRÔLE
[6]
Selon la demanderesse, la décision visée par la présente demande de contrôle comprend la lettre d'exclusion datée du 16 février 2012 et les notes consignées par l'agent dans le Système mondial de gestion des cas (SMGC). S'ajoute également le courriel daté du 28 juin 2012 par lequel l'agent a informé la demanderesse que sa demande de réexamen avait été refusée.
[7]
Dans les notes qu'il a consignées le 2 décembre 2011, l'agent déclare que la demanderesse a fourni une lettre de l'Université de Jaffna indiquant qu'elle faisait la dernière année de ses études de médecine en 2010, mais rien pour montrer qu'elle était toujours inscrite. L'agent n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse n'avait pas cessé d'être inscrite à un établissement d'enseignement reconnu et correspondait donc à la définition d'« enfant à charge », et il mentionne qu'il fallait envoyer une lettre avisant la demanderesse qu'elle avait 30 jours pour dissiper ce doute. Selon les notes, une lettre à cet effet a été envoyée à la demanderesse le 6 décembre 2011.
[8]
L'agent écrit dans ses notes que d'autres documents avaient été reçus le 10 janvier 2012. Il répète que rien n'indique que la demanderesse était toujours étudiante après décembre 2010. Dans ses notes du 7 février 2012, l'agent écrit que la demanderesse [traduction] « a présenté des éléments de preuve montrant qu'elle avait fait des stages cliniques, mais aucun de ces stages n'a été fait après 2008 et il semble s'agir de stages internes ». Selon les notes de l'agent, la demanderesse a soumis une lettre de l'Université de Jaffna indiquant qu'elle faisait la dernière année de ses études de médecine en 2010, mais rien pour montrer qu'elle était toujours inscrite. L'agent n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse correspondait à la définition d'« enfant à charge ».
[9]
La lettre d'exclusion a été envoyée le 16 février 2012. Selon les notes consignées le 3 avril 2012, une lettre du conseiller de la demanderesse a été reçue le 22 mars 2012. L'agent a encore une fois examiné les documents produits par la demanderesse et a constaté que le dossier d'étudiante de la demanderesse se terminait en décembre 2010. Par conséquent, la demanderesse ne pouvait être considérée comme une enfant à charge. L'agent a aussi inscrit que les motifs d'ordre humanitaire n'étaient pas suffisants pour l'emporter sur l'irrecevabilité. L'agent a conclu qu'il n'avait pas à répondre au représentant de la demanderesse, étant donné que l'exclusion prononcée au départ tenait toujours.
[10]
L'agent a avisé la demanderesse que sa demande de réexamen avait été rejetée le 28 juin 2012.
QUESTION EN LITIGE
[11]
La demanderesse soulève la question suivante dans la présente demande:
a. L'agent a-t-il enfreint les règles de justice naturelle et d'équité procédurale en n'examinant pas et en ne répondant pas aux observations présentées le 23 mars 2012 par la demanderesse sur son statut d'enfant à charge dans la demande de résidence permanente de sa mère?
NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[12]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a statué qu'il n'était pas toujours nécessaire de procéder à une analyse de la norme de contrôle. Lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à une question précise est bien établie par la jurisprudence, la cour de révision peut l'appliquer. Ce n'est que lorsque cette démarche se révèle infructueuse que la cour de révision doit examiner les quatre facteurs qui entrent en jeu dans l'analyse de la norme de contrôle.
[13]
La demanderesse soulève une question d'équité procédurale. Comme l'a statué la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt
Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 100, « [i] l appartient aux tribunaux judiciaires et non au ministre de donner une réponse juridique aux questions d'équité procédurale ». Par conséquent, la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision correcte.
[14]
Le défendeur soutient que c'est la décision sur la demande de réexamen qui est visée par la présente demande de contrôle, et que cette décision est un exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[15]
Dans ses arguments, la demanderesse conteste aussi le caractère suffisant des motifs de l'agent. Dans l'arrêt
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a statué, au paragraphe 14, que l'insuffisance des motifs ne permet pas à elle seule de casser une décision. Plutôt, « les motifs doivent être examinés en corrélation avec le résultat et ils doivent permettre de savoir si ce dernier fait partie des issues possibles ». Ainsi, toute question que pourrait soulever le caractère suffisant des motifs sera examinée sous l'angle de la raisonnabilité de la décision.
[16]
Lorsqu'une décision est soumise au contrôle judiciaire selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse s'intéresse « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ». Voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et l'arrêt
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . En d'autres termes, la Cour ne devrait intervenir que si la décision est déraisonnable en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».

ARGUMENTS
La demanderesse
[18]
La demanderesse souligne que sa mère avait répondu aux préoccupations de l'agent en envoyant des observations additionnelles le 24 décembre 2011. Dans ses notes du 10 janvier 2012, l'agent écrit que la mère de la demanderesse a bel et bien envoyé d'autres documents, mais rien n'indique si l'agent a répondu à ces observations. Les notes du 7 février 2012 disent simplement que les éléments de preuve n'ont toujours pas convaincu l'agent.
[19]
La demanderesse affirme que l'agent soulève, dans ses notes du 7 février 2012, bon nombre de questions sur son éducation et les dates de ses études, mais que ces questions ne lui ont jamais été posées. Si ces questions lui avaient été posées, elle aurait pu donner une explication. La demanderesse avait indiqué que les stages cliniques faisaient partie du programme de la faculté de médecine, mais l'agent a simplement déclaré qu'il semblait s'agir de stages internes. C'était, soutient la demanderesse, une pure hypothèse de la part de l'agent, qui ne lui a jamais fait part de ses doutes, comme le prescrit la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[20]
En outre, le 23 mars 2012, l'avocat de la demanderesse à Toronto a préparé d'autres documents à envoyer à Colombo, dont la réception a été confirmée. Les notes indiquent simplement qu'un courriel du conseiller de la demanderesse a été reçu le 3 avril 2012, ce qui est erroné, car l'avocat de la demanderesse n'a envoyé aucun courriel en avril 2012. Il a envoyé seulement une lettre et des observations le 23 mars 2012, et transmis, le 12 juin 2012, un courriel dans lequel il demandait une réponse aux observations envoyées le 23 mars 2012.
[21]
La demanderesse affirme que l'agent a essentiellement omis de communiquer avec sa mère ou avec son avocat à propos des observations envoyées en décembre 2011 et en mars 2012. L'obligation d'équité exige que les agents informent les demandeurs de leurs préoccupations, pour que ceux-ci aient la chance d'« apaiser » ces préoccupations (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Lorsque la question de l'admissibilité d'un étranger au Canada est en jeu, de même que la séparation d'une famille, le demandeur doit avoir une possibilité réelle et équitable de répondre (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
Le guide opérationnel ENF2/OP18 de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada,
Évaluation de l'interdiction de territoire
, présente la façon dont les agents des visas doivent traiter les demandes quand la question de l'interdiction de territoire se pose. En ce qui concerne l'équité procédurale, ce document précise que le demandeur doit pouvoir répondre aux allégations, que l'information fournie par le demandeur doit être soigneusement et équitablement examinée, et que le demandeur doit recevoir et pouvoir commenter tout document pertinent, être avisé des doutes et avoir la possibilité de répondre. Selon la demanderesse, l'agent n'a pas respecté ces lignes directrices.
[23]
La demanderesse ajoute que ses observations n'ont pas été réellement analysées ni prises en considération. Par exemple, l'agent n'a pas tenu compte de la lettre dans laquelle T. Thusyanthan déclarait que la demanderesse était inscrite à temps plein à l'Université de Jaffna. L'agent demeurait simplement non convaincu du statut de la demanderesse, sans dire pourquoi. Si les motifs d'une décision ne sont pas suffisants pour permettre à un demandeur de comprendre le fondement de cette décision, la décision est déraisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Bien que l'obligation de fournir des motifs détaillés soit moindre dans le cas de l'agent des visas, il doit quand même fournir des motifs réels et indiquer le fondement probatoire sur lequel reposaient sa décision finale et ses conclusions essentielles (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
La demanderesse souligne que l'agent ne s'est même pas donné la peine d'enregistrer les observations transmises le 23 mars 2012, qu'il n'y avait pas répondu ni n'avait avisé son avocat qu'une décision avait été prise des mois auparavant. Comme dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'agent n'a pas informé la demanderesse des facteurs qu'il avait jugés pertinents, ce qui constitue un manquement à la justice naturelle.
Le défendeur
[25]
Le défendeur souligne que, selon l'avis de demande, la demanderesse souhaitait obtenir l'autorisation de présenter une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision du 28 juin 2012, à savoir la décision sur la demande de réexamen. La décision sur une demande de réexamen se distingue du refus initial de l'agent (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[26]
La Cour d'appel fédérale a clairement établi que, lorsqu'une décision sur une demande de réexamen est contestée, il n'est pas loisible à la Cour d'aller au-delà de cette décision et de procéder au contrôle judiciaire de la décision initiale (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Comme la Cour d'appel l'a statué au paragraphe 3 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Pour une raison ou pour une autre, M. Williams n'a pas demandé le contrôle judiciaire de la décision initiale et le délai qui s'applique aux demandes de contrôle judiciaire a expiré en mai 2004. En conséquence, compte tenu de la jurisprudence, la Cour n'est pas habilitée, dans le cadre du contrôle judiciaire d'une décision sur une demande de réexamen, à réviser une décision initiale du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.)).
[27]
Le défendeur soutient que la demanderesse a présenté une demande d'autorisation qui concernait seulement la décision sur la demande de réexamen datée du 28 juin 2012, et qu'elle ne devrait donc pas avoir la possibilité de contester la décision initiale.
[28]
Le défendeur ajoute que l'affirmation de la demanderesse selon laquelle l'agent n'avait pas répondu à sa demande de mars 2012 n'est pas fondée. Comme le montre la réponse transmise par courriel le 28 juin 2012 (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 25), la demanderesse a été informée que la décision de février 2012 ne changerait pas. La réception de la réponse est aussi attestée par le fait que la demanderesse n'a pas présenté de demande de
mandamus
, et l'avis de demande déposé par la demanderesse indique que le 28 juin 2012 est la date où la décision a été rendue.
[29]
La demande de réexamen a été étudiée le 11 avril 2012, et la demanderesse a été avisée du résultat le 28 juin 2012. La demanderesse n'a subi aucun préjudice pour ne pas avoir été avisée sitôt la décision prise. L'argument de la demanderesse selon lequel la décision comporte une lacune sur le plan de l'analyse n'est pas fondé; il est établi que les notes consignées par l'agent dans le SMGC font partie de la décision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
Le défendeur souligne que, contrairement à l'âge de l'enfant à charge, le statut d'étudiant n'est pas « gelé » à la date de la demande de résidence permanente. La demanderesse est tenue de montrer qu'elle est un membre admissible de la catégorie du regroupement familial à la date où la demande est présentée et à la date où la demande est tranchée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Aucun élément de preuve ne montrait à l'agent que la demanderesse était inscrite à une formation universitaire à temps plein après décembre 2010.
[31]
En réponse à la lettre envoyée à la mère de la demanderesse en décembre 2011, une lettre écrite sous serment disant que la demanderesse s'était inscrite à la faculté de médecine le 20 décembre 2003 et qu'elle dépendait financièrement de sa mère a été transmise à l'agent. Cette lettre n'indique pas que la demanderesse suivait une formation universitaire à temps plein au moment où la demande a été évaluée. La lettre de l'Université de Jaffna dit que la demanderesse était étudiante de janvier 2004 jusqu'à décembre 2010. Si la demanderesse était toujours inscrite, le défendeur soutient qu'il était raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que la lettre de l'Université l'indique. Les autres documents fournis par la demanderesse ne confirment pas non plus que celle-ci a poursuivi ses études après décembre 2010.
[32]
D'après la preuve produite, l'agent a raisonnablement conclu que la demanderesse ne fréquentait pas d'établissement d'enseignement postsecondaire après décembre 2010 et que, pour cette raison, elle ne correspondait pas à la définition d'« enfant à charge ». Selon le défendeur, la demanderesse allègue sans fondement que l'agent a manqué à l'équité procédurale.
[33]
Il incombait à la demanderesse de présenter toute l'information nécessaire et la documentation à l'appui. Comme la Cour l'a statué dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Il est bien établi qu'un demandeur de visa a l'entière responsabilité de présenter à l'agent des visas toute la documentation qui pourrait permettre à ce dernier de rendre une décision favorable. Les agents des visas n'ont par conséquent aucune obligation générale en droit de demander des détails ou des renseignements additionnels avant de rejeter une demande de visa au motif que la documentation soumise ne suffisait pas à les convaincre que le demandeur répondait aux critères de sélection pertinents.
Voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[34]
L'agent n'avait nulle obligation d'informer la demanderesse du caractère déficient de la documentation qu'elle avait présentée ni de lui donner l'occasion de dissiper les doutes qu'il pouvait avoir (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La demanderesse avait l'obligation de présenter à l'agent toute la documentation pertinente. L'agent des visas n'est pas tenu de chercher d'autres éléments de preuve ni de mener une entrevue quand le demandeur n'a pas fourni suffisamment de documents à l'appui de sa demande (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le fardeau de la preuve n'est pas transféré à l'agent, et le demandeur n'a pas droit à une entrevue personnelle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 28).
[35]
En outre, le défendeur affirme que l'agent a raisonnablement apprécié la question de la réunification de la famille. L'agent a tenu compte du fait que la demanderesse avait de la famille au Sri Lanka, ainsi qu'au Canada, en France et en Australie.
ANALYSE
[36]
Le dossier révèle clairement que le bureau des visas avait des doutes sur le statut d'enfant à charge de la demanderesse et a préparé à cet égard une lettre d'équité datée du 6 décembre 2011. La mère de la demanderesse a répondu à la lettre d'équité le 16 décembre 2011. Les notes consignées dans le SMGC le 4 janvier 2012 indiquent que la lettre a été reçue et qu'elle sera examinée par le bureau des visas.
[37]
Les notes consignées dans le SMGC le 10 janvier 2012 révèlent que la demanderesse et sa mère ont présenté d'autres observations. Toutefois, rien dans les observations et les documents présentés par la demanderesse et par sa mère n'établissait que la demanderesse était inscrite dans un établissement postsecondaire et qu'elle y suivait des cours. Selon les notes du SMGC, quand les documents ont été examinés le 7 février 2012, le bureau des visas n'était toujours pas convaincu, d'après la preuve présentée, que la demanderesse était bien une enfant à charge au sens du Règlement, et l'examen de la preuve montre clairement pourquoi.
[38]
La mère de la demanderesse a été informée de la décision défavorable dans une lettre datée du 16 février 2012. Dans une lettre datée du 23 mars 2012, difficile à catégoriser, l'avocat de la demanderesse a présenté d'autres observations. Il affirme que la décision défavorable du 16 février 2011 était incorrecte, mais aucune demande de révision de cette décision n'a été faite. Lue dans son intégralité, la lettre du 23 mars 2012 semble être une demande de réexamen.
[39]
La décision visée par le présent contrôle est le refus de la demande de réexamen daté du 28 juin 2012. La décision a été transmise par courriel à l'avocat de la demanderesse, en réponse au courriel du 12 juin 2012 dans lequel l'avocat demandait une réponse aux observations présentées le 23 mars 2012:
[traduction] Veuillez prendre note que la décision transmise par lettre en février 2012 quant à la fille exclue de la demandeure est maintenue.
[40]
Selon les notes du SMGC qui accompagnaient la lettre, l'agent a étudié la demande de réexamen et a fait une analyse transparente et intelligible afin de déterminer si la demanderesse était une enfant à charge au moment pertinent. Comme le défendeur le souligne, le statut d'étudiant n'est pas « gelé » à la date de la demande, et la demanderesse ne conteste pas le fait que l'agent a apprécié son statut d'étudiante au moment où il a rendu sa décision comme telle. Voir la décision
Hamid,
précitée, aux paragraphes 55 à 60.
[41]
Les motifs pour lesquels la demande de réexamen a été refusée ressortent nettement du dossier: aucun des documents soumis par l'avocat le 23 mars 2012 n'établissait que la demanderesse était une enfant à charge au moment pertinent, ni ne surmontait la difficulté relevée dans les observations précédentes. Comme le révèlent les notes du SMGC, la difficulté découlait du fait que, selon la preuve, la demanderesse avait étudié à l'Université de Jaffna de janvier 2004 à décembre 2010. Le dossier universitaire de la demanderesse se terminait en décembre 2010, et aucun élément de preuve n'établissait que la demanderesse poursuivait ses études, comme le veut le Règlement, ou était encore inscrite en 2011. Par conséquent, l'agent n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse n'avait pas cessé d'être inscrite à un établissement d'enseignement reconnu et correspondait donc en ce sens à la définition d'« enfant à charge », de manière à pouvoir être incluse comme personne à charge dans la demande de sa mère.
[42]
La demanderesse a soulevé divers motifs à l'appui de sa demande de contrôle, mais aucun d'entre eux ne résiste à l'examen. Compte tenu de la preuve soumise à l'agent, la décision de ne pas modifier la décision initiale n'était pas déraisonnable. De plus, aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale n'a été commis. Il incombait à la demanderesse de produire la preuve requise pour établir la relation de dépendance. Voir la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 28.
[43]
De même, il ressort nettement des notes du SMGC que l'agent a tenu compte du facteur d'ordre humanitaire de la réunification de la famille, mais a conclu que ce facteur ne l'emportait pas sur l'irrecevabilité de la demande parce que deux des membres de la fratrie de la demanderesse demeuraient au Sri Lanka, un autre résidait en France et encore un autre, en Australie. La demanderesse se plaint de ne pas avoir eu l'occasion de traiter de ces questions, mais elle aurait pu le faire dans la demande de réexamen datée du 23 mars 2012 déposée par son avocat, et elle ne m'a présenté aucun élément donnant à penser que l'agent avait apprécié la situation d'une quelconque façon inexacte ou inappropriée. À l'appui de sa demande de réexamen, la demanderesse a présenté les mêmes éléments de preuve que ceux qui avaient été soumis dans le cadre de la décision initiale, de sorte qu'il était hautement improbable que la demande de réexamen soit accueillie en l'absence de détails pouvant être pris en considération pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire.
[44]
Les avocats s'entendent pour dire qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier, et la Cour en convient.
