Strickland, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of an Adjudicator appointed pursuant to the
Public Service Labour Relations Act
, SC 2003, c 22, s 2 (PSLRA) regarding policy grievances brought by the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) and the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC).
Background
[2]
PIPSC and PSAC, as bargaining agents for their respective bargaining units, each presented policy grievances pursuant to section 220 of the PSLRA. The grievances related to the manner in which the Treasury Board applied the Workforce Adjustment Appendix, which forms a part of the collective agreements between PSAC and the Treasury Board, and the Workforce Adjustment Agreement, which is incorporated in all collective agreements between PIPSC and the Treasury Board. The grievances were consolidated as they raised similar issues and the relevant provisions of the Workforce Adjustment Appendix and the Workforce Adjustment Agreement (collectively, the WFAA) were identical.
[3]
Pursuant to section 221 of the PSLRA, the grievances were referred to adjudication. No witnesses were called and the grievances proceeded on the basis of oral and written submissions. The Adjudicator was asked to rule on four questions. Question 1 is the subject of the application for judicial review.
Decision Under Review
[4]
The decision, dated April 9, 2013 (Decision), sets out Question 1 as follows:
1. Is the employer [Treasury Board] required under the WFAA [collectively, the Workforce Adjustment Appendix and the Workforce Adjustment Agreement] to establish an alternation system or establish systems and processes to facilitate alternation opportunities?
[5]
The Adjudicator also set out the relevant provisions of the Workforce Adjustment Appendix, as representative of the WFAA, and the positions of the parties.
[6]
In that regard, the Adjudicator stated that PSAC and PIPSC took the view that sections 1.1.5, 1.1.30 and 6.2.1 of the WFAA gave rise to an obligation of the Treasury Board, as the employer, to establish an alternation system and to establish systems and processes to facilitate alternation opportunities. Section 1.1.5 should be read to include alternations and section 1.1.30 to include an obligation to facilitate alternations. Section 6.2.1 required all departments or organizations to participate in the alternation process. The primary objective of the WFAA was an attempt to secure continued employment in the federal public service for affected employees.
[7]
The Adjudicator stated that the Treasury Board took the position that the WFAA did not create, and that the Treasury Board had no obligation to establish, an alternation process. The WFAA specified, in detail, the duties of the different actors, and almost all of the duties were imposed on employees or departments. There was no role for the employer in the alternation process. It was not legitimate to rely on the general obligations of the WFAA to create any obligation in this regard for the employer. As for section 1.1.5, it simply required departments to "...establish systems to facilitate redeployment or retraining of their affected employees, surplus employees, and laid-off persons", and that it was not legitimate to interpret "redeployment" as being the equivalent of an alternation.
[8]
The Adjudicator interpreted the issue before him, in part, to be whether the WFAA required the Treasury Board (or departments) to establish an alternation system or establish systems and processes to facilitate alternation opportunities. He did not accept the submissions of PSAC and PIPSC that sections 1.1.30 or 6.2.1 supported their position. However, with respect to section 1.1.5, he found as follows:
24. However, section 1.1.5 requires the establishment of systems that "...facilitate redeployment or retraining of ...affected employees, surplus employees, and laid-off persons." The word "redeployment" is not a term used in any pertinent legislation and is not a term of art (although the word "deployment" is defined in subsection 2(1) of the
Public Service Employment Act
, S.C. 2003, c 22, ss 12, 13). The ordinary dictionary meaning of "redeployment," in my view, is the assignment (of troops, employees or resources) to a new place or task: see
www.oxforddictionaries.com
. The question I have to address is whether the word "redeployment" could have been intended to include alternations. I agree with the employer's submission that it would be wrong in principle to interpret the word "redeployment" as a synonym for "alternation." However, in an alternation, several things are happening: the opting employee and the alternate find each other; the proposed alternation is examined by the department; and then the two employees switch positions, the opting employee moving to the position that is intended to continue, and the alternate moving to the position that is slated for elimination. In my view, the word "redeployment", while not a synonym for "alternation," is apt to describe part of an alternation, namely, the process whereby the two employees switch positions. It must be recalled that the whole purpose of the WFAA is to address the issue of lay-offs and potential lay-offs in a workforce adjustment situation, and that this is the context of the parties' use of the word "redeployment." I also note that the systems that departments are required to establish are those that will facilitate the redeployment, among others, of "affected employees," a term that includes opting employees. I am therefore satisfied that section 1.1.5 applies to the alternation process.
25. The obligation on the employer in section 1.1.5 is to "...establish systems to facilitate redeployment ...of ... affected employees ..." Given the limited arguments I received in relation to Question 1, I do not intend to spell out in this interim decision the parameters of this obligation. It is sufficient for me to state that the obligation extends to the facilitation of opting employees switching positions with alternates.
Issues
[9]
In my view the issues are as follows:
1. Is the Applicant's submission a new argument not advanced before the Adjudicator and, if so, should it be considered on judicial review?
2. What is the standard of review?
3. Was the Adjudicator's decision reasonable?
Collective Agreement Terms
[10]
It is of assistance to set out the relevant provisions of the Workplace Adjustment Agreement, which are identical to the relevant provisions of the Workplace Adjustment Appendix:
Objectives
It is the policy of the Treasury Board to maximize employment opportunities for indeterminate employees affected by workforce adjustment situations, primarily through ensuring that, wherever possible, alternative employment opportunities are provided to them. This should not be construed as the continuation of a specific position or job but rather as continued employment.
[...]
Definitions
Affected employee
(employé-e touché) Is an indeterminate employee who has been informed in writing that his or her services may no longer be required because of a workforce adjustment situation.
Alternation
(échange de postes) Occurs when an opting employee (not a surplus employee) who wishes to remain in the Core Public Administration exchanges positions with a non-affected employee (the alternate) willing to leave the Core Public Administration with a transition support measure or with an education allowance.
[...]
Education Allowance
(indemnité d'étude) - is one of the options provided to an indeterminate employee affected by normal workforce adjustment for whom the deputy head cannot guarantee a reasonable job offer. The Education Allowance is a cash payment, equal to the Transitional Support Measure (see Annex "B"), plus a reimbursement of tuition from a recognized learning institution, book and mandatory equipment costs, up to a maximum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
[...]
Opting Employee
(employé-e- optant) is an indeterminate employee whose services will no longer be required because of a workforce adjustment situation, who has not received a guarantee of a reasonable job offer from the deputy head and who has one hundred and twenty (120) days to consider the options in section 6.3 of this Appendix.
[...]
Surplus employee
(employé-e excédentaire) - is an indeterminate employee who has been formally declared surplus, in writing, by his or her deputy head.
[...]
Workforce adjustment
(réaménagement des effectifs) - is a situation that occurs when a deputy head decides that the services of one or more indeterminate employees will no longer be required beyond a specified date because of a lack of work, the discontinuance of a function, a relocation in which the employee does not wish to relocate or an alternative delivery initiative.
Part I
Roles and responsibilities
Departments or organizations
1.1.1
Since indeterminate employees who are affected by workforce adjustment situations are not themselves responsible for such situations, it is the responsibility of departments or organizations to ensure that they are treated equitably and, given every reasonable opportunity to continue their careers as public service employees.
1.1.5
Departments or organizations shall establish systems to facilitate redeployment or retraining of their affected employees, surplus employees, and laid-off persons
[...]
Part VI
Options for employees
6.1 General
6.1.1
Deputy heads will be expected to provide a guarantee of a reasonable job offer for those affected employees for whom they know or can predict employment availability. A deputy head who cannot provide such a guarantee shall provide his or her reasons in writing, if requested by the employee. Affected employees in receipt of this guarantee would not have access to the choice of options below.
6.1.2
Employees who are not in receipt of a guarantee of a reasonable job offer from the deputy head have one hundred and twenty (120) days to consider the three options below before a decision is required of them.
6.1.3
The opting employee must choose, in writing, one (1) of the three (3) options of section 6.3 of this Appendix within the one hundred and twenty (120) day window. The employee cannot change options once he or she has made a written choice.
6.1.4
If the employee fails to select an option, the employee will be deemed to have selected Option (a), twelve (12) month surplus priority period in which to secure a reasonable job offer, at the end of the one hundred and twenty (120) day window.
[...]
6.2
Alternation
6.2.1
All departments or organizations must participate in the alternation process.
6.2.2
An alternation occurs when an opting employee who wishes to remain in the Core Public Administration exchanges positions with a non-affected employee (the alternate) willing to leave the Core Public Administration under the terms of Part VI of this Appendix.
6.2.3
Only an opting employee, not a surplus one, may alternate into an indeterminate position that remains in the Core Public Administration.
[....]
6.3 Options
6.3.1
Only opting employees who are not in receipt of the guarantee of a reasonable job offer from the deputy head will have access to the choice of options below:
(a)
(i) Twelve (12) month surplus priority period in which to secure are reasonable job offer: should a reasonable job offer not be made within a period of twelve (12) months, the employee will be laid off in accordance with the Public Service Employment Act. Employees who choose or are deemed to have chosen this Option are surplus employees.
(ii) At the request of the employee, this twelve (12) month surplus priority period shall be extended by the unused portion of the one hundred and twenty (120) day opting period referred to in 6.1.2 which remains once the employee has selected in writing Option (a).
(iii) When a surplus employee who has chosen, or who is deemed to have chosen, Option (a) offers to resign before the end of the twelve (12) month surplus priority period, the deputy head may authorise a lump-sum payment equal to the surplus employee's pay for the substantive position for the balance of the surplus period, up to a maximum of six (6) months. The amount of the lump sum payment for the pay in lieu cannot exceed the maximum of that which he or she would have received had they chosen Option (b), the Transition Support Measure.
(iv) Departments or organizations will make every reasonable effort to market a surplus employee during the employee's surplus period within his or her preferred area of mobility
or
(b) Transition Support Measure (TSM) is a cash payment, based on the employee's years of service in the public service (see Annex "B") made to an opting employee. Employees choosing this Option must resign but will be considered to be laid-off for purposes of severance pay.
or
(c) Education allowance is a Transitional Support Measure (see Option (b) above) plus an amount of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for reimbursement of receipted expenses of an opting employee for tuition from a learning institution and costs of books and mandatory equipment.
Employees choosing Option (c) could either:

Submissions and Analysis
Issue 1 - Is the Applicant's submission a new argument not advanced before the Adjudicator and, if so, should it be considered on judicial review?
Respondents' Position
[11]
The Respondents submit that the sole issue raised by the application for judicial review could have been, but was not raised before the Adjudicator. Accordingly, the Court should not exercise its discretion so as to now consider this new issue (
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 22-23 [
Alberta Teachers
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[12]
The Respondents submit that the issue raised by the Applicant is that the term "affected employees" cannot be interpreted to include opting employees and, therefore, opting employees do not fall within the scope of section 1.1.5 of the WFAA. However, that none of the Applicant's arguments in this respect were made before the Adjudicator. Further, the Respondents' written adjudication submissions clearly relied on section 1.1.5 and argued that the provision must be read as including alternating employees. As an alternation by definition includes opting employees this should have alerted the Applicant to the issue of whether affected employees include opting employees and caused them to raise it before the Adjudicator. Additionally, the Applicant made responding arguments concerning the applicability of section 1.1.5 which disputed the relevance of that provision on the basis that "redeployment" did not include the concept of alternation, but this was not on the basis that "opting employees" did not fit within any of the groups of employees listed in section 1.1.5.
Applicant's Position
[13]
The Applicant made no written submissions on this point. However, when appearing before me submitted that the issue of whether the term affected employees includes opting employees arose from the Adjudicator's reasons, it was not dealt with at the hearing. In such circumstances, the Applicant cannot be expected to speculate on what the Adjudicator's reasons may include and raise these as issues at the hearing. These circumstances are distinguished from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, which concerned the raising of a Charter argument for the first time and without notice at judicial review; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, which concerned the admissibility of new evidence on judicial review; and, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, which concerned the dismissal of a complaint by an employee alleging that a union had failed in its duty of fair representation. There, an argument was advanced that a relevant provision of the subject collective agreement was invalid which had not been argued before the Labour Relations Board. The Court held that it could not decide a question which had not been raised before the administrative tribunal.
[14]
The Applicant also submitted that while the PSAC's written arbitration submission addressed section 1.1.5, it did not address the question of whether the term affected employees includes opting employees. Further, the Applicant's submissions directly addressed the Respondents' submissions in that they asserted that section 1.1.5 makes no mention of alternations. In any event, the interpretation of section 1.1.5 is not a new issue.
Analysis
[15]
The Court has the discretion not to consider an issue for the first time on judicial review where it would be inappropriate to do so. Generally, this discretion will not be exercised in favour of an applicant on judicial review where the issue could have been, but was not, raised before the tribunal (
Alberta Teachers,
above, at paras 22-23).
[16]
The Court in
Alberta Teachers
noted that there are a number of rationales justifying this general rule. These include that the legislature has entrusted the determination of the issue to the administrative tribunal. Accordingly, Courts should respect the legislative choice of the tribunal as the first instance decision-maker by providing the tribunal with an opportunity to address and treat the issue first and to make its views known. This is particularly true where the issue raised for the first time on judicial review relates to the tribunal's specialized function or expertise. In such circumstances, the Court should be careful not to overlook the loss of the benefit of the tribunals' views inherent in allowing the issue to be raised. Further, the raising of an issue for the first time on judicial review may unfairly prejudice the opposing party and may deny the Court the adequate evidentiary record required to consider the issue (
Alberta Teachers
, above, at paras 24, 26).
[17]
However, in
Alberta Teachers
, the Court ultimately concluded that the rationale for the rule had limited application in that case. There, the Commissioner had expressed his views in several other decisions and, therefore, had the opportunity to decide the issue in first instance providing the benefit of his expertise. Further, no evidence was required to consider the issue and no prejudice was alleged. Rather, it was a straightforward determination of the law, the basis of which could be considered on judicial review.
[18]
In this matter, the record indicates that in its written submissions to the Adjudicator, PSAC relied on section 1.1.5 (and 1.1.30 and 6.2.1) of the WFAA to support its position that the Treasury Board was required to establish an alternation system or establish systems and processes to facilitate alternation opportunities. As regards to section 1.1.5, PSAC submitted:
PSAC maintains that this provision must be read as including alternating employees. First, while 1.1.5 is a provision that relates to all workforce adjustment situations, there is nothing in the WFAA that suggests the provision should be limited so as to not include alternation. PSAC further submits that, as "redeployment" is not defined in the WFAA or the collective agreement generally, the definition of "deployment" from the
Public Service Employment Act
...should inform the interpretation of 1.1.5. "Deployment" is defined in the
PSEA
as "the transfer of a person from one position to another." This broad definition clearly encompasses alternation and therefore 1.1.5 should be read as including alternation.
[19]
The Applicant's written submissions to the Adjudicator argued that if the parties had intended to impose an obligation on the Treasury Board to establish an alternation system or establish systems and processes to facilitate alternation opportunities, it would have indicated this expressly and in detail. However, the WFAA is silent on these obligations and reading them in by way of reference to general provisions would be a significant departure from the parties' intentions. With respect to section 1.1.5, the Applicant submitted that it only concerns systems to facilitate redeployment or retraining and does not mention a system for alternations.
[20]
In the present application, the Applicant argues that the Adjudicator linked the requirement in section 1.1.5 to the alternation process by reading "opting employees" into "affected employees". However, an "opting employee" is neither an affected employee, a surplus employee nor a laid off employee, all three of which terms are defined in the WFAA provisions separately from the definition of opting employees. The term "affected employees" cannot be interpreted to include opting employees and, therefore, the latter does not fall within section 1.1.5.
[21]
Ultimately, the Adjudicator found that the term "redeployment", as found in the context of section 1.1.5, described a part of the alternation process. He then went on to note that the systems that departments are required to establish are those that will facilitate redeployment, amongst others, of affected employees - a term that he stated included opting employees. For both of these reasons, the Adjudicator was satisfied that section 1.1.5 applies to the alternation process.
[22]
In my view, it was open to the Applicant to have argued before the Adjudicator, as regards to section 1.1.5, that the term "affected employee" does not include an "opting employee". However, on review of the record, it appears that this was not the focus of the parties at the adjudication, rather that this question arose from the Adjudicator's reasons. Further, because the parties both addressed section 1.1.5 at the adjudication, what the Applicant now raises is not so much a new issue but one which is related to the central focus of their submissions, being whether or not section 1.1.5 included alternations.
[23]
Additionally, as in
Alberta Teachers
, here the rationales for the rule against permitting new issues to be addressed at judicial review may have limited application. In this case, the Court has the benefit of the Adjudicator's view on this issue of the interpretation of section 1.1.5. While his reasons on the point are limited, his contextual approach in interpreting the provisions of the WFFA is sufficient to explain his finding. Further, there is no allegation that permitting the argument to proceed would prejudice the Respondents. And, finally, there are also no concerns about a further evidentiary record to support this argument given that at the adjudication no witnesses were called and the matter was before the Adjudicator on the basis of written and oral submissions only.
[24]
Accordingly, the application may proceed.
Issue 2 - What is the standard of review?
Applicant's Submissions
[25]
The Applicant submits that the standard of review for a decision of the Public Service Labour Relations Board and its adjudicator in interpreting and applying the provisions of a collective agreement has previously been determined to be reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 57, 62 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[26]
A decision of an adjudicator or arbitrator will be found to be unreasonable where they have ignored the plain and ordinary meaning of a term of a collective agreement (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> leave to appeal to SCC refused in [2009] SCCA No 544 [
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses
]) or they have interpreted a collective agreement in a manner that produces an absurdity (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Respondents' Submissions
[27]
The Respondents agree that the standard of review in this matter is reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , both above). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court found that while the employer's proposed interpretation of the collective agreement would have been reasonably open to the adjudicator, the Court had no basis to interfere with his decision as the interpretation he adopted was also reasonably open to him. It is insufficient for a Court to conclude that another interpretation would have been reasonable, or that it would have reached a different result. The Court could only set aside the adjudicator's decision if it fell outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes in light of the facts and the law.
Analysis
[28]
An exhaustive analysis is not required in every case to determine the proper standard of review. Courts must first ascertain whether jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded to a decision-maker with regard to a particular category of question
(Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 57, 62). If so, then that standard of review may be adopted.
[29]
I agree with the parties that the Adjudicator's Decision in interpreting and applying the provisions of a collective agreement is subject to a standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
In reviewing the Decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Adjudicator came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 59). It is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence.
Issue 3 - Was the Adjudicator's Decision reasonable?
Applicant's Submissions
[31]
The Applicant submits that the Adjudicator's Decision is unreasonable as it ignores the plain and ordinary meaning of defined terms of the WFAA and because it interprets the WFAA in a manner that produces an absurdity by extending the scope of section 1.1.5 in a manner not contemplated or negotiated by the parties.
[32]
The essence of the Applicant's submissions is that the parties chose to separately define "affected employee", "opting employee" and "surplus employee" in the WFAA. The term "affected employee" does not include an "opting employee". As the terms are defined separately and are mutually exclusive, there was no basis for the Adjudicator to read "opting employees" into "affected employees" when interpreting section 1.1.5 and, thereby, extending the reach of that provision.
[33]
The Applicant submits that each of these defined terms represents a stage along a continuum for employees. An employee begins as an affected employee whose services may no longer be required because of a workforce adjustment situation. This can cover a wide group of employees who, ultimately, may not find themselves in an actual workforce adjustment situation. When it is determined that an employee's services are no longer required, they are no longer an "affected employee" and become either an "opting employee" or receive a guarantee of a reasonable job offer. At the end of the 120-day opting period, an employee may move further along the continuum and become a surplus employee (section 6.3.1(a)(i)). This illustrates that the parties to the WFAA cast their minds to the issue and choose to separately define these terms.
[34]
This is not a point requiring the application of the Adjudicator's expertise and it is clear that he simply made an error.
Respondents' Submissions
[35]
The Respondents submit that the Adjudicator's interpretation of the term "affected employees" as including opting employees was reasonable. This interpretation was consistent with the context of the WFAA and its underlying objective and was reasonably open to the Adjudicator. The Applicant has not presented any compelling argument that an "affected employee" cannot reasonably be interpreted to include an "opting employee" and its interpretation would undermine the overall purpose of the WFAA.
[36]
In essence, the Adjudicator found that once an employee becomes an opting employee, he or she is still an affected employee and, therefore, can have both affected and opting status at the same time. The Adjudicator interpreted opting employees as being a subgroup of affected employees.
[37]
The Respondents submit that the Applicant has not presented an interpretive argument supporting its assertion that affected employees and opting employees are mutually exclusive. The mere fact that they are separately defined terms does not necessarily mean that they are mutually exclusive. Therefore, there is nothing inherently unreasonable about the Adjudicator's conclusion that "opting employees" constitute a defined subgroup of "affected employees".
[38]
The Adjudicator's interpretation is consistent with other provisions of the WFAA such as the definition of the "education allowance". Since an education allowance is one of the three options available to opting employees, it implies that for the purposes of the WFAA, opting employees are still considered to be affected employees. Further, the interpretation is also consistent with the "Objectives" section of the WFAA. Therefore, the Applicant's claim that each employee status represents a discrete stage along a continuum is inconsistent with the language of the WFAA.
[39]
The Applicant's interpretation would lead to absurd results as indicated by section 6.2.2 of the alternation provisions of the WFAA. This provision only makes sense if the term affected employee includes opting employees. Further, according to the Applicant's interpretation, the employer is obligated to establish systems to facilitate redeployment or retraining of affected employees, surplus employees, and laid off persons, but it has no such obligation for opting employees. This is illogical and undermines the purpose of maximizing employment opportunities for employees affected by a workforce adjustment. It also frustrates the purpose expressed in the "Objectives" section of the WFAA.
[40]
The Adjudicator's finding that "affected employees" includes opting employees was logical, consistent with the WFAA as a whole and its underlying purpose and fell within the range of possible acceptable outcomes.
Analysis
[41]
The WFAA does separately define the terms "affected employee", "opting employee" and "surplus employee", all of which terms are used in section 1.1.5. The commonality of the three terms is that they all concern indeterminate employees.
[42]
The Applicant argues that these defined terms are mutually exclusive and that a continuum applies that precludes an affected employee from also being an opting employee. However, the continuum described by the Applicant is not explicit in the WFAA nor is the subcategory characterization of the Respondents.
[43]
That said, in my view, the provisions of the WFAA do not entirely support the Applicant's position. For example, section 6.1.1 requires deputy heads to provide a guarantee of a reasonable job offer for those "affected employees" for whom they know or can predict employment availability. It goes on to state that affected employees
in receipt
of the guarantee would not have access to the choice of options set out below (in section 6.3.1). Thus, while the definition of "affected employees" states that they are indeterminate employees who have been informed that their services "may" no longer be required because of a workforce adjustment situation, while "opting employees" are defined as those whose services "will" no longer be required, section 6.1.1 refers to "affected employees" in reference to employees who have received a guarantee. Their services
will
be required, yet they remain affected employees. This implies that affected employees not in receipt of the guarantee would have access to the opting provisions, but also remain affected employees.
[44]
Further, section 6.2.2 of the alternation provisions of the WFAA states that "[a]n alternation occurs when an opting employee who wishes to remain in the Core Public Administration exchanges positions with a non-affected employee (the alternate) willing to leave the Core Public Administration under the terms of Part VI of this Appendix". If, as the Applicant suggests, an affected employee excludes an opting employee then there would be no need to refer to a "non-affected" employee. The Applicant's interpretation would mean that an opting employee could alternate with another opting employee as it is not an affected employee. The provision, as written, reflects the intent of the parties and the alternation process only if the term "affected employee" includes opting employees.
[45]
Similarly, the WFAA defines an "education allowance" as "...one of the options provided to an indeterminate employee affected by normal workforce adjustment for whom the deputy head cannot guarantee a reasonable job offer ..." . The education allowance uses the term "affected by" yet it is one option available to opting employees as per section 6.3.1.
[46]
I would also note that where the WFAA intended to exclude one group of employees in reference to another, it does so explicitly. For example, the definition of alternation makes it clear that it occurs when "an opting employee (not a surplus employee) who wishes to remain in the Core Public Administration exchanges positions with a non-affected employee". Section 6.2.3 states that "only an opting employee, not a surplus one, may alternate into an indeterminate position that remains in the Core Public Administration". There are no similar carve outs between affected employees and opting employees.
[47]
In his reasons, the Adjudicator addresses the question of whether the word "redeployment" as used in section 1.1.5 could include alternations. In concluding that a redeployment was apt to describe part of an alternation but was not synonymous with one, he noted that it must be recalled that the whole purpose of the WFAA is to address the issue of lay-offs and potential lay-offs in a workforce adjustment situation and that it was in that context that the parties to the WFAA used the word "redeployment". From there, he found that the systems that departments are required to establish are those that will facilitate the redeployment, amongst others, of "affected employees," "a term that includes opting employees". He was therefore satisfied that section 1.1.5 applies to the alternation process. In my view, while the Adjudicator's Decision turned on the redeployment issue, he also considered section 1.1.5 in the context of the purpose of the WFAA as a whole which is consistent with the principles of collective agreement interpretation (Ronald M. Snyder,
Collective Agreement Arbitration in Canada
(4th ed), (LexisNexis: Canada 2009) at pp 28-31).
[48]
In that regard, the stated objectives of the WFAA are to maximize employment opportunities for indeterminate employees "affected by" workforce adjustment situations, primarily through ensuring that, wherever possible, alternative employment opportunities are provided to them. Section 1.1.1 states that since indeterminate employees who are "affected by" workforce adjustment situations are not themselves responsible for such situations, it is the responsibility of departments or organizations to ensure that they are treated equitably and, given every reasonable opportunity to continue their careers as public service employees.
[49]
Given this, and considering the deference owed to adjudicators in cases of this nature ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 37; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 23, 35) and that all employees are in one way or another "affected by" workplace adjustments regardless of the ultimate outcome in any given circumstances, the Adjudicator's interpretation of the term "affected employees" as including "opting employees" was reasonably open for him to make and falls within a range of acceptable and possible outcomes ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 47-48;
Newfoundland and Labrador  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 15).
JUDGMENT
[50]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed; and
2. The Respondents shall have their costs in the amount of $3,500.00.

Procureur général du Canada (demandeur) v. l'Alliance de la Fonction Publique du Canada et l'Institut Professionnel de la Fonction Publique du Canada (défendeurs)
[1]
La juge Strickland
[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée à l'encontre d'une décision d'un arbitre de grief (l'arbitre), nommé en vertu de la
Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique
, LC 2003, c 22, article 2 (la LRTFP), relativement à des griefs de principe qu'ont déposés l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (l'AFPC) et l'Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada (l'IPFPC).
Le contexte
[2]
L'IPFPC et l'AFPC, à titre d'agents négociateurs pour leurs unités de négociation respectives, ont présenté chacun un grief de principe en vertu de l'article 220 de la LRTFP. Ces griefs étaient liés à la manière dont le Conseil du Trésor appliquait l'Appendice sur le réaménagement des effectifs, qui constitue un volet des conventions collectives conclues entre l'AFPC et le Conseil du Trésor, ainsi que l'Entente sur le réaménagement des effectifs, laquelle est intégrée à toutes les conventions collectives conclues entre l'IPFPC et le Conseil du Trésor. Les griefs ont été regroupés, parce qu'ils soulevaient des questions semblables et que les dispositions applicables de l'Appendice sur le réaménagement des effectifs et de l'Entente sur le réaménagement des effectifs (collectivement, l'ARE/ERE) étaient identiques.
[3]
Les griefs ont été renvoyés à l'arbitrage en vertu de l'article 221 de la LRTFP. Aucun témoin n'a été appelé, et les griefs ont été instruits sur le fondement d'observations orales et écrites. L'arbitre avait à trancher quatre questions, et la demande de contrôle judiciaire porte sur la première d'entre elles.
La décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle
[4]
La décision, datée du 9 avril 2013 (la décision), énonce la première question en ces termes:
[traduction]
1. L'employeur [le Conseil du Trésor] est-il tenu aux termes de l'ARE/ERE [collectivement, l'Appendice sur le réaménagement des effectifs et l'Entente sur le réaménagement des effectifs] d'établir un système d'échange de postes ou d'établir des systèmes et des processus en vue de faciliter les possibilités d'échange de postes?
[5]
L'arbitre a également reproduit les dispositions applicables de l'Appendice sur le réaménagement des effectifs, qui sont représentatives de celles de l'ARE/ERE, de même que les positions des parties.
[6]
À cet égard, l'arbitre a décrété que l'AFPC et l'IPFPC avaient exprimé l'avis que les sections 1.1.5, 1.1.30 et 6.2.1 de l'ARE/ERE obligeaient le Conseil du Trésor, à titre d'employeur, à établir un système d'échange de postes ainsi que des systèmes et des processus en vue de faciliter les possibilités d'échange de postes. La section 1.1.5 devrait être interprétée comme englobant les échanges de postes, et la section 1.1.30 une obligation de faciliter les échanges de postes. La section 6.2.1 exigeait que tous les ministères ou organisations participent au processus d'échange de postes. L'objectif principal de l'ARE/ERE était de garantir aux employés touchés un emploi continu au sein de la fonction publique fédérale.
[7]
L'arbitre a déclaré que le Conseil du Trésor était d'avis que l'ARE/ERE ne créait pas - et que le Conseil du Trésor n'était pas obligé d'établir - un processus d'échange de postes. L'ARE/ERE précisait, en détail, les obligations des différents intervenants, et la quasi-totalité de ces obligations étaient imposées aux employés ou aux ministères. L'employeur n'avait aucun rôle à jouer dans le processus d'échange de postes. Il n'était pas légitime de se fonder sur les obligations générales de l'ARE/ERE en vue de créer pour l'employeur une obligation quelconque à cet égard. Quant à la section 1.1.5, elle exigeait simplement que les ministères « [...] établissent des systèmes facilitant la réaffectation ou le recyclage de leurs employés touchés et excédentaires et de leurs personnes mises en disponibilité » et qu'il n'était pas légitime de considérer qu'une « réaffectation » était l'équivalent d'un échange de postes.
[8]
L'arbitre a considéré que la question qui lui était soumise consistait, en partie, à savoir si l'ARE/ERE exigeait que le Conseil du Trésor (ou les ministères) établisse un système d'échange de postes ou établisse des systèmes et des processus en vue de faciliter les possibilités d'échange de postes. Il n'a pas souscrit aux observations de l'AFPC et de l'IPFPC selon lesquelles les sections 1.1.30 ou 6.2.1 étayaient leur position. Cependant, pour ce qui était de la section 1.1.5, il a conclu:
24. Cependant, selon la clause 1.1.5, l'établissement de systèmes « [...] facilitant la réaffectation ou le recyclage [des ...] employé-e-s touchés et excédentaires et [des ...] personnes mises en disponibilité » est exigé. Le terme [traduction] « réaffectation » n'est utilisé dans aucune loi pertinente et il ne s'agit pas d'un terme technique (bien que le terme [traduction] « mutation » soit défini dans le paragraphe 2(1) de la
Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique
, L.C. 2003, ch. 22, art. 12 et 13). Le sens ordinaire du terme [traduction] « réaffectation » dans le dictionnaire, à mon avis, est le fait [traduction] « d'affecter (les troupes militaires, les employés ou les ressources) à un nouveau lieu ou à une nouvelle tâche » (voir
www.oxforddictionaries.com
). La question sur laquelle je dois me pencher est de savoir si le terme [traduction] « réaffectation » était censé inclure les échanges de postes. Je souscris à l'argument de l'employeur selon lequel ce serait une erreur, en principe, de donner au terme [traduction] « réaffectation » le sens d' » échange de postes ». Toutefois, dans un échange de postes, plusieurs événements se produisent: l'employé optant et le remplaçant se retrouvent; le ministère procède à l'examen de l'échange de postes proposé; puis les deux employés échangent leurs postes, l'employé optant occupera alors le poste qui est à conserver, et le remplaçant occupera le poste devant être supprimé. À mon avis, le terme [traduction] « réaffectation », bien que n'étant pas un synonyme d'« échange de postes », permet de décrire une partie de la notion d'échange de postes, à savoir le processus dans lequel deux employés échangent leurs postes. Il convient de rappeler que l'objectif même de l'ARE/ERE est de régler la question des mises en disponibilité et des éventuelles mises en disponibilité dans une situation de réaménagement des effectifs, et qu'il s'agit du contexte dans lequel les parties utilisent le terme [traduction] « réaffectation ». Je souligne également que les systèmes que les ministères doivent établir sont ceux qui permettront de faciliter la réaffectation, entre autres, des [traduction] « employés touchés », expression comprenant les employés optants. Je suis donc convaincu que la clause 1.1.5 s'applique au processus d'échange de postes.
25. L'obligation imposée à l'employeur dans la clause 1.1.5 est d'« [ ...établir] des systèmes facilitant la réaffectation [...] de [ses] employé-e-s touchés [...] ». Étant donné le peu d'arguments que j'ai reçu relativement à la Question 1, je n'ai pas l'intention d'énoncer dans la présente décision provisoire les paramètres de cette obligation. Il me suffit de déclarer que l'obligation englobe le fait d'aider les employés optants à échanger leurs postes avec des remplaçants.
Les questions en litige
[9]
Selon moi, les questions en litiges sont les suivantes:
1. L'observation du demandeur est-elle un nouvel argument non invoqué plus tôt devant l'arbitre et, dans l'affirmative, faut-il l'examiner dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire?
2. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
3. La décision de l'arbitre est-elle raisonnable?
Les dispositions de la convention collective
[10]
Il est utile d'énoncer les dispositions applicables de l'Entente sur le réaménagement des effectifs, qui sont identiques à celles de l'Appendice sur le réaménagement des effectifs:
Objectifs
Le Conseil du Trésor a pour politique d'optimiser les possibilités d'emploi pour les employés nommés pour une période indéterminée en situation de réaménagement des effectifs, en s'assurant que, dans toute la mesure du possible, on offre à ces employés d'autres possibilités d'emploi. On ne doit toutefois pas considérer que la présente directive assure le maintien dans un poste en particulier, mais plutôt le maintien d'emploi.
[...]
Définitions
Échange de postes
(alternation)
- Un échange a lieu lorsqu'un employé optant (non excédentaire) qui préférerait rester dans l'administration publique centrale échange son poste avec un employé non touché (le remplaçant) qui désire quitter l'administration publique centrale avec une mesure de soutien à la transition ou une indemnité d'étude.
[...]
Employé excédentaire
(surplus employee)
- Employé nommé pour une période indéterminée et que l'administrateur général dont il relève a officiellement déclaré excédentaire par écrit.
Employé optant
(opting employee)
- Employé nommé pour une période indéterminée dont les services ne seront plus requis en raison d'une situation de réaménagement des effectifs et qui n'a pas reçu de l'administrateur général de garantie d'une offre d'emploi raisonnable. L'employé a 120 jours pour envisager les options offertes à l'article 6.3 du présent appendice.
Employé touché
(affected employee)
- Employé nommé pour une période indéterminée qui a été avisé par écrit que ses services pourraient ne plus être requis en raison d'une situation de réaménagement des effectifs.
[...]
Indemnité d'études
(education allowance)
- Une des options offertes à un employé nommé pour une période indéterminée touché par une situation de réaménagement des effectifs normale et à qui l'administrateur général ne peut garantir une offre d'emploi raisonnable. L'indemnité d'étude est un montant forfaitaire équivalant à la mesure de soutien à la transition (voir l'appendice B), plus le remboursement des frais de scolarité d'un établissement d'enseignement reconnu et des frais de livres et d'équipement requis, jusqu'à un maximum de 10 000 $.
[...]
Réaménagement des effectifs
(work force adjustment)
- Situation qui se produit lorsqu'un administrateur général décide que les services d'un ou de plusieurs employés nommés pour une période indéterminée ne seront plus requis au-delà d'une certaine date en raison d'un manque de travail, de la suppression d'une fonction, de la réinstallation d'une unité de travail à un endroit où l'employé ne veut pas être réinstallé ou du recours à un autre mode d'exécution.
Partie I
Rôles et responsabilités
Ministères ou organisations
1.1.1
Étant donné que les employés nommés pour une période indéterminée qui sont touchés par un réaménagement des effectifs ne sont pas eux-mêmes responsables de cette situation, il incombe aux ministères ou aux organisations de veiller à ce qu'ils soient traités équitablement et à ce qu'on leur donne toutes les possibilités raisonnables de poursuivre leur carrière dans la fonction publique.
[...]
1.1.5
Les ministères ou les organisations établissent des systèmes facilitant la réaffectation ou le recyclage de leurs employés touchés et excédentaires et de leurs personnes mises en disponibilité.
[...]
Partie VI
Options offertes aux employés
6.1 Généralités
6.1.1
Normalement, les administrateurs généraux garantiront une offre d'emploi raisonnable à un employé touché qui sera déclaré excédentaire et pour lequel ils savent qu'il existe ou ils peuvent prévoir une disponibilité d'emploi. L'administrateur général qui ne peut offrir une telle garantie doit en préciser les raisons par écrit, si l'employé le demande. L'employé qui reçoit cette garantie ne se verra pas offrir le choix des options ci-dessous.
6.1.2
L'employé qui ne reçoit pas de garantie d'offre d'emploi raisonnable de l'administrateur général aura 120 jours pour envisager les trois options mentionnées plus bas avant de devoir prendre une décision.
6.1.3
L'employé optant doit présenter par écrit son choix de l'une des options énumérées à l'article 6.3 du présent appendice pendant la période de 120 jours de réflexion. Il ne peut changer d'option lorsqu'il a fait son choix par écrit.
6.1.4
Si l'employé n'a pas fait de choix à la fin de la période de réflexion de 120 jours, il sera réputé avoir choisi l'option a), priorité d'employé excédentaire d'une durée de douze mois pour trouver une offre d'emploi raisonnable.
[...]
6.2
Échange de postes
6.2.1
Tous les ministères ou les organisations participeront au processus d'échanges de postes.
6.2.2
Un échange a lieu lorsqu'un employé optant qui préférerait rester dans l'administration publique centrale échange son poste avec un employé non touché (le remplaçant) qui désire quitter l'administration publique centrale, conformément aux dispositions de la partie VI de la présente directive.
6.2.3
Seul l'employé optant, et non celui dont le poste a été déclaré excédentaire, peut être affecté à un poste non touché d'une durée indéterminée dans l'administration publique centrale.
[...]
6.3 Options
6.3.1
Seul l'employé optant qui ne reçoit pas une garantie d'offre d'emploi raisonnable de son administrateur général aura le choix entre les options suivantes:
a)
(i) une priorité d'employé excédentaire d'une durée de douze mois pour trouver une offre d'emploi raisonnable. Si une offre d'emploi raisonnable n'est pas faite au cours de ces douze mois, l'employé sera mis en disponibilité conformément à la
Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique
. L'employé qui exerce cette option ou qui est présumé l'exercer est excédentaire.
(ii) À la demande de l'employé, cette période de priorité d'excédentaire de douze mois est prolongée de la période non utilisée de 120 jours décrite au paragraphe 6.1.2, une fois qu'il a choisi par écrit l'option a).
(iii) Lorsqu'un employé excédentaire qui a choisi, ou est réputé avoir choisi, l'option a) propose de démissionner avant la fin de sa période de priorité d'excédentaire de douze mois, l'administrateur général peut autoriser le versement d'un montant forfaitaire égal à la rémunération du poste d'attache pendant le reste de la période de priorité d'excédentaire jusqu'à un maximum de six mois. Le montant forfaitaire de rémunération en remplacement de la période excédentaire ne peut pas dépasser le maximum que l'employé aurait touché s'il avait choisi l'option b), la MST.
(iv) Les ministères ou les organisations feront tout effort raisonnable pour présenter un employé excédentaire au cours de sa période de priorité d'excédentaire dans son secteur préféré de mobilité.
ou
b) une MST, à savoir un montant forfaitaire versé à l'employé optant. Le montant est calculé selon le nombre d'années de service au sein de la fonction publique (voir appendice C). L'employé qui choisit cette option doit démissionner mais il aura droit à une indemnité de départ au taux de mise en disponibilité.
ou
c) une indemnité d'étude, qui correspond à la MST (voir option b) ci-dessus) plus un montant n'excédant pas 10 000 $ pour le remboursement des frais de scolarité d'un établissement d'enseignement et des frais de livres et d'équipement requis, appuyés par un reçu. L'employé qui retient cette option:

Les observations et l'analyse
Question no 1 - L'observation du demandeur est-elle un nouvel argument non invoqué plus tôt devant l'arbitre et, dans l'affirmative, faut-il l'examiner dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire?
La position des défendeurs
[11]
Les défendeurs sont d'avis que l'unique question que soulève la demande de contrôle judiciaire aurait pu être soumise à l'arbitre, mais elle ne l'a pas été. La Cour n'a donc pas à exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire de façon à examiner maintenant cette nouvelle question (
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Alberta Teachers
), aux paragraphes 22 et 23;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 26;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 5).
[12]
Les défendeurs font valoir que la question que soulève le demandeur est que l'expression « employés touchés » ne peut s'interpréter comme englobant les employés optants et que, de ce fait, ces derniers ne tombent pas sous le coup de la section 1.1.5 de l'ARE/ERE. Toutefois, aucun des arguments qu'invoque le demandeur à cet égard n'a été soumis à l'arbitre. De plus, dans les observations écrites qu'ils ont présentées dans le cadre de l'arbitrage, les défendeurs se fondaient manifestement sur la section 1.1.5 et ils ont fait valoir que la disposition devait être interprétée comme englobant les employés participant à un échange de postes. Vu que, par définition, l'échange de postes englobe les employés optants, cela aurait dû attirer l'attention du demandeur sur le fait de savoir si les employés touchés englobaient les employés optants et l'inciter à soumettre la question à l'arbitre. Par ailleurs, le demandeur a présenté, au sujet de l'applicabilité de la section 1.1.5, des arguments en réponse qui contestaient la pertinence de cette disposition au motif que la « réaffectation » n'englobait pas la notion d'échange de postes, mais pas sur le fondement selon lequel les « employés optants » n'étaient inclus dans aucun des groupes d'employés énumérés à la section 1.1.5.
La position du demandeur
[13]
Le demandeur n'a pas présenté d'observations écrites sur ce point. Cependant, lorsqu'il a comparu devant moi, il a fait valoir que la question de savoir si l'expression « employés touchés » englobait les employés optants découlait des motifs de l'arbitre et que cette question n'avait pas été abordée à l'audience. Dans ces circonstances, on ne peut pas s'attendre à ce que le demandeur émette des hypothèses sur ce que les motifs de l'arbitre pourraient inclure et soulever ces derniers en tant que questions en litige à l'audience. Ces circonstances se distinguent de celles dont il était question dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, qui portait sur le fait d'invoquer pour la première fois un argument fondé sur la Charte et sans préavis au stade du contrôle judiciaire, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, qui concernait l'admissibilité de nouvelles preuves au stade du contrôle judiciaire ainsi que dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, qui avait trait au rejet d'une plainte d'un employé alléguant qu'un syndicat avait manqué à son devoir de juste représentation. Dans cette affaire, il était invoqué qu'une disposition applicable de la convention collective concernée était invalide, un argument qui n'avait pas été soulevé devant la Commission des relations de travail. On a jugé qu'on ne pouvait pas trancher une question qui n'avait pas été soulevée devant le tribunal administratif.
[14]
Le demandeur a aussi fait valoir que les observations écrites que l'AFPC avait présentées dans le cadre de l'arbitrage, même si elles traitaient de la section 1.1.5, ne portaient pas sur le fait de savoir si l'expression « employés touchés » englobait les employés optants. Par ailleurs, ses observations traitaient directement de celles des défendeurs, en ce sens que ces derniers affirmaient que la section 1.1.5 ne faisait aucunement mention des échanges de poste. Quoi qu'il en soit, l'interprétation de la section 1.1.5 n'est pas une nouvelle question litigieuse.
Analyse
[15]
La Cour a le pouvoir discrétionnaire de ne pas examiner une question pour la première fois dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire s'il n'y a pas lieu de le faire. De façon générale, ce pouvoir discrétionnaire n'est pas exercé en faveur du demandeur au stade du contrôle judiciaire si cette question aurait pu être soulevée devant le tribunal administratif, mais ne l'a pas été (
Alberta Teachers
, précité, aux paragraphes 22 et 23).
[16]
Dans l'arrêt
Alberta Teachers
, la Cour suprême du Canada a fait remarquer qu'il y avait un certain nombre de raisons qui justifiaient cette règle générale, dont le fait que le législateur avait confié le règlement de la question en litige au tribunal administratif. Par conséquent, les cours de justice devraient respecter le choix législatif de désigner le tribunal administratif comme décideur de première instance en donnant à ce dernier la possibilité d'examiner la question et d'en traiter en premier ainsi que de faire connaître son avis. Cela est particulièrement vrai lorsque la question soulevée pour la première fois dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire est liée à la fonction spécialisée ou à l'expertise du tribunal administratif. Dans de telles circonstances, la Cour devrait prendre garde de ne pas perdre de vue la perte de l'avantage qu'offre la position du tribunal administratif, qui est inhérente au fait d'autoriser à soulever la question. De plus, le fait de soulever une question pour la première fois dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire peut porter injustement préjudice à la partie adverse et priver la Cour du dossier de preuve qui est nécessaire pour examiner la question (
Alberta Teachers
, précité, aux paragraphes 24 et 26).
[17]
Cependant, dans
Alberta Teachers
, la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu en définitive que, dans cette affaire, la raison d'être de la règle était d'une application restreinte. Dans cette affaire, le commissaire avait exprimé sa position dans plusieurs autres décisions et avait donc eu le loisir de trancher la question en première instance, offrant ainsi l'avantage de son expertise. De plus, aucune preuve n'était requise pour examiner la question et aucun préjudice n'était allégué. Il s'agissait plutôt de la simple détermination d'une question de droit, dont le fondement pouvait être examiné au stade du contrôle judiciaire.
[18]
Dans la présente affaire, il ressort du dossier que, dans ses observations écrites à l'arbitre, l'AFPC s'est fondée sur la section 1.1.5 (ainsi que sur les sections 1.1.30 et 6.2.1) de l'ARE/ERE à l'appui de sa position selon laquelle le Conseil du Trésor était tenu d'établir un système d'échange de postes ou d'établir des systèmes et des processus en vue de faciliter les possibilités d'échange de postes. Pour ce qui est de la section 1.1.5, l'AFPC a fait valoir:
[traduction]
L'AFPC soutient que cette disposition doit s'interpréter comme englobant les employés participant à un échange de postes. Premièrement, bien que la section 1.1.5 soit une disposition qui se rapporte à toutes les situations de réaménagement des effectifs, rien dans l'ARE/ERE ne donne à penser qu'il faudrait limiter cette disposition de façon à ce qu'elle n'englobe pas les échanges de postes. L'AFPC soutient de plus qu'étant donné que le terme « réaffectation » n'est pas défini dans l'ARE/ERE ou la convention collective en général, c'est la définition du mot « mutation » que l'on trouve dans la
Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique
[...] qui doit éclairer l'interprétation de cette section. Dans la LEFP, une « mutation » s'entend du « [t]ransfert d'une personne d'un poste à un autre [...] ». Cette définition générale inclut à l'évidence l'échange de postes, et il y a donc lieu de considérer que la section 1.1.5 englobe cette option.
[19]
Dans ses observations écrites à l'arbitre, le demandeur a fait valoir que, si les parties avaient voulu imposer au Conseil du Trésor l'obligation d'établir un système d'échange de postes ou d'établir des systèmes et des processus en vue de faciliter les possibilités d'échange de postes, elles l'auraient indiqué expressément et en détail. Cependant, l'ARE/ERE ne dit rien au sujet de ces obligations, et le fait de les inclure par voie de référence à des dispositions de nature générale reviendrait à s'éloigner sensiblement des intentions des parties. Pour ce qui est de la section 1.1.5, le demandeur a fait valoir que celle-ci n'a trait qu'aux systèmes visant à faciliter la réaffectation ou le recyclage et qu'elle ne fait pas mention d'un système d'échange de postes.
[20]
Dans la présente demande, le demandeur soutient que l'arbitre a fait un lien entre l'exigence énoncée à la section 1.1.5 et le processus d'échange de postes en englobant les « employés optants » dans les « employés touchés ». Cependant, un « employé optant » n'est ni un employé touché, ni un employé excédentaire ni un employé mis en disponibilité, trois termes qui sont définis dans des dispositions de l'ARE/ERE séparément de celle des employés optants. L'expression « employés touchés » ne peut s'interpréter comme englobant les employés optants, et, de ce fait, ceux-ci ne tombent pas sous le coup de la section 1.1.5.
[21]
En fin de compte, l'arbitre a conclu que le mot « réaffectation », dans le contexte de la section 1.1.5, décrivait une partie du processus d'échange de postes. Il a ensuite signalé que les systèmes que les ministères sont tenus d'établir sont ceux qui faciliteront une réaffectation, notamment, d'employés touchés - un terme qui, a-t-il dit, incluait les employés optants. Pour ces deux raisons, l'arbitre s'est dit convaincu que la section 1.1.5 s'appliquait au processus d'échange de postes.
[22]
À mon avis, il était loisible au demandeur de faire valoir devant l'arbitre, pour ce qui était de la section 1.1.5, que l'expression « employé touché » n'englobait pas un « employé optant ». Cependant, après avoir examiné le dossier, il semble qu'il ne s'agissait pas là du principal point qui préoccupait les parties à l'arbitrage, mais que cette question découlait plutôt des motifs de l'arbitre. De plus, étant donné que les parties ont toutes deux traité de la section 1.1.5 à l'arbitrage, le point que le demandeur soulève maintenant n'est pas tant une question nouvelle qu'une question qui est liée à l'objet principal de leurs observations, soit le fait de savoir si la section 1.1.5 englobe les échanges de postes ou non.
[23]
En outre, comme dans l'affaire
Alberta Teachers
, dans le cas présent les justifications de la règle interdisant d'autoriser à traiter d'une nouvelle question dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire peuvent être d'une application restreinte. En l'espèce, la Cour a eu le bénéfice de la position de l'arbitre sur la question de l'interprétation de la section 1.1.5. Bien que ses motifs sur ce point soient restreints, l'approche contextuelle qu'il a suivie pour interpréter les dispositions de l'ARE/ERE suffit pour expliquer sa conclusion. De plus, il n'est pas allégué que le fait de permettre d'avancer l'argument porterait préjudice aux défendeurs. Et, enfin, il n'y a pas non plus de préoccupations au sujet de la présentation d'un autre dossier de preuve à l'appui de cet argument, étant donné qu'à l'arbitrage, aucun témoin n'a été appelé et que l'affaire a été soumise à l'arbitre sur le seul fondement d'observations écrites et orales.
[24]
En conséquence, la demande peut être instruite.
Question no 2 - Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
Les observations du demandeur
[25]
Le demandeur soutient qu'il a été conclu que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à une décision de la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique et de son arbitre, relativement à l'interprétation et à l'application des dispositions d'une convention collective, est la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 57 et 62;
Procureur général du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 23;
Procureur général du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), aux paragraphes 36 à 38).
[26]
La décision d'un arbitre est déraisonnable lorsque ce dernier fait fi du sens clair et ordinaire d'une disposition d'une convention collective (
Canada (Procureur général) c Lamothe
, 2009 CAF 2, au paragraphe 13;
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22, autorisation de pourvoi à la CSC refusée dans [2009] CSCA no 544 (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses
)) ou interprète une convention collective d'une manière qui donne lieu à une absurdité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 45).
Les observations des défendeurs
[27]
Les défendeurs conviennent que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique en l'espèce est la raisonnabilité ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitées). Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour a conclu que, bien qu'il ait été raisonnablement loisible à l'arbitre de retenir l'interprétation de la convention collective que proposait l'employeur, la Cour n'avait aucune raison de modifier sa décision, car il lui était aussi raisonnablement loisible d'adopter son interprétation. Il suffit, pour une cour de justice, de conclure qu'une autre interprétation aurait été raisonnable, ou qu'elle serait arrivée à un résultat différent. La Cour ne pouvait infirmer la décision de l'arbitre que si celle-ci n'appartenait pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
Analyse
[28]
Il n'est pas nécessaire dans tous les cas de procéder à une analyse exhaustive en vue de déterminer la norme de contrôle qui s'applique. Les tribunaux doivent tout d'abord vérifier si la jurisprudence a déjà déterminé de manière satisfaisante le degré de déférence qu'il convient d'accorder à un décideur pour ce qui est d'une catégorie de question particulière (
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 53; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 57 et 62). Dans l'affirmative, on peut adopter cette norme de contrôle.
[29]
Je conviens avec les parties que la décision par laquelle l'arbitre interprète et applique les dispositions d'une convention collective est assujettie à la norme de la raisonnabilité ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée; voir aussi
Canada (Procureur général) c McManaman
, 2013 CF 1064, au paragraphe 14).
[30]
Pour contrôler la décision en fonction de la norme de la raisonnabilité, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si l'arbitre est arrivé à une conclusion qui n'est pas transparente, justifiable et intelligible et qui n'appartient pas aux issues acceptables, compte tenu de la preuve qui lui a été présentée ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 59). Il n'appartient pas à une cour de révision de substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable, pas plus qu'il ne lui appartient d'apprécier à nouveau la preuve.
Question no 3 - La décision de l'arbitre est-elle raisonnable?
Les observations du demandeur
[31]
Le demandeur soutient que la décision de l'arbitre est déraisonnable, parce qu'elle fait abstraction du sens clair et ordinaire de termes qui sont définis dans l'ARE/ERE et qu'elle interprète l'ARE/ERE d'une manière qui mène à une absurdité en étendant la portée de la section 1.1.5 d'une façon que les parties n'ont pas envisagée ou négociée.
[32]
L'élément essentiel des observations du demandeur est que les parties ont décidé de définir séparément les expressions « employé touché », « employé optant » et « employé excédentaire » dans l'ARE/ERE. L'expression « employé touché » n'englobe pas l'« employé optant ». Étant donné que ces expressions sont définies séparément et qu'elles s'excluent l'une l'autre, rien ne permettait à l'arbitre d'intégrer les « employés optants » dans les « employés touchés » au moment d'interpréter la section 1.1.5 et, de ce fait, d'étendre la portée de cette disposition.
[33]
Le demandeur soutient que chacune de ces expressions définies représente un stade particulier le long d'un continuum que doivent suivre les employés. Un employé commence par être un employé touché dont les services ne sont peut-être plus requis à cause d' une situation de réaménagement des effectifs. Cette situation peut englober un vaste groupe d'employés qui, en fin de compte, ne se retrouvent peut-être pas dans une situation de réaffectation des effectifs proprement dite. Quand il est décidé que les services d'un employé ne sont plus requis, c'est employé n'est plus un « employé touché » et il devient un « employé optant » ou il reçoit une garantie d'une offre d'emploi raisonnable. À la fin de la période de réflexion de 120 jours, l'employé peut passer à un stade ultérieur du continuum et devenir excédentaire (section 6.3.1a)(i)). Cela illustre que les parties à l'ARE/ERE se sont entendues sur la question et ont décidé de définir ces termes séparément.
[34]
Il ne s'agit pas d'un point qui requiert l'application de l'expertise de l'arbitre, et il est évident que celui-ci s'est simplement trompé.
Les observations des défendeurs
[35]
Les défendeurs soutiennent que l'interprétation de l'arbitre, à savoir que l'expression « employés touchés » englobe les employés optants, est raisonnable. Cette interprétation concorde avec le contexte de l'ARE/ERE et son objectif sous-jacent, et il était raisonnablement loisible à l'arbitre de la faire. Le demandeur n'a présenté aucun argument convaincant selon lequel un « employé touché » ne peut raisonnablement s'interpréter comme englobant un « employé optant », et son interprétation minerait l'objet tout entier de l'ARE/ERE.
[36]
Essentiellement, l'arbitre a conclu qu'une fois qu'un employé devient un employé optant, il demeure un employé touché et peut donc bénéficier en même temps du double statut d'employé touché et d'employé optant. L'arbitre a jugé que les employés optants étaient un sous-groupe des employés touchés.
[37]
Les défendeurs soutiennent que le demandeur n'a pas présenté d'argument interprétatif à l'appui de son affirmation selon laquelle les employés touchés et les employés optants s'excluaient mutuellement. Le simple fait qu'il s'agisse d'expressions définies séparément ne veut pas forcément dire qu'elles s'excluent mutuellement. Il n'y a donc rien de déraisonnable en soi à la conclusion de l'arbitre selon laquelle les « employés optants » constituent un sous-groupe défini des « employés touchés ».
[38]
L'interprétation de l'arbitre concorde avec d'autres dispositions de l'ARE/ERE, comme la définition de l'« indemnité d'études ». Comme cette indemnité est l'une des trois options dont disposent les employés optants, cela implique que, pour les besoins de l'ARE/ERE, les employés optants sont encore considérés comme des employés touchés. De plus, l'interprétation concorde également avec la section « Objectifs » de l'ARE/ERE. De ce fait, la prétention du demandeur selon laquelle chaque statut d'employé représente un stade distinct le long d'un continuum ne concorde pas avec le libellé de l'ARE/ERE.
[39]
L'interprétation que fait le demandeur mènerait à des résultats absurdes, comme l'indique la section 6.2.2 des dispositions de l'ARE/ERE en matière d'échange de postes. Cette disposition n'est logique que si l'expression « employé touché » englobe les « employés optants ». De plus, selon l'interprétation du demandeur, l'employeur est obligé d'établir des systèmes permettant de faciliter la réaffectation ou le recyclage des employés touchés, des employés excédentaires et des personnes mises en disponibilité, mais il n'est pas soumis à cette obligation dans le cas des employés optants. Cela est illogique et mine l'objet de l'optimisation des possibilités d'emploi qui sont offertes aux employés touchés par un réaménagement des effectifs. Cela fait également échec à l'objet exprimé à la section « Objectifs » de l'ARE/ERE.
[40]
La conclusion de l'arbitre selon laquelle les « employés touchés » englobent les « employés optants » est logique, elle concorde avec l'ARE/ERE dans son ensemble et avec l'objet qui la sous-tend, et elle appartient aux issues possibles et acceptables.
Analyse
[41]
L'ARE/ERE définit bel et bien séparément les expressions « employé touché », « employé optant » et « employé excédentaire », lesquelles sont toutes utilisées à la section 1.1.5. Le point commun entre les trois est qu'elles se rapportent à des employés nommés pour une période indéterminée.
[42]
Le demandeur soutient que ces expressions définies s'excluent mutuellement et qu'il existe un continuum qui empêche un employé touché d'être aussi un employé optant. Cependant, le continuum que décrit le demandeur n'apparaît pas explicitement dans l'ARE/ERE, pas plus que la sous-catégorie qu'évoquent les défendeurs.
[43]
Cela dit, selon moi, les dispositions de l'ARE/ERE n'étayent pas tout à fait la position du demandeur. Par exemple, la section 6.1.1 oblige les administrateurs généraux à garantir une offre d'emploi raisonnable aux « employés touchés » pour lesquels ils savent ou peuvent prévoir qu'un emploi sera disponible. On y lit ensuite que les employés touchés qui
ont reçu
la garantie n'auraient pas accès au choix d'options énoncées plus loin (à la section 6.3.1). C'est donc dire que, bien que la définition d'un « employé touché » indique qu'il s'agit d'un employé nommé pour une période indéterminée qui a été avisé que ses services « pourraient » ne plus être requis en raison d'une situation de réaménagement des effectifs, tandis que l'« employé optant » est défini comme étant celui dont les services ne « seront » plus requis, la section 6.1.1 fait état des « employés touchés » en faisant référence à ceux qui ont reçu une garantie. Leurs services
seront
requis, mais ils demeurent des employés touchés. Cela implique que les employés touchés qui n'ont pas reçu la garantie auraient accès aux dispositions en matière d'options, mais qu'ils demeurent aussi des employés touchés.
[44]
Par ailleurs, la section 6.2.2 des dispositions de l'ARE/ERE en matière d'échange de postes indique qu'« [u]n échange a lieu lorsqu'un employé-e optant qui préférait rester dans l'administration publique centrale échange son poste avec un employé-e non-touché (le remplaçant) qui désire quitter l'administration publique centrale, conformément aux dispositions de la partie VI du présent appendice ». Si, comme le suggère le demandeur, un employé touché exclut un employé optant, il ne serait pas nécessaire dans ce cas de faire référence à un employé « non touché ». L'interprétation du demandeur signifierait qu'un employé optant pourrait faire un échange avec un autre employé optant, car il n'est pas un employé touché. La disposition, telle que libellée, ne reflète l'intention des parties et le processus d'échange de postes que si l'expression « employé touché » englobe les employés optants.
[45]
Dans le même ordre d'idées, l'ARE/ERE définit une « indemnité d'études » comme « [...] une des options offertes à un employé-e nommé pour une période indéterminée touché par une situation de réaménagement des effectifs normale et à qui l'administrateur général ne peut garantir une offre d'emploi raisonnable [...] ». Cette définition emploie l'expression « touché par », mais il s'agit pourtant d'une option offerte aux employés optants selon la section 6.3.1.
[46]
Je ferais également remarquer que, lorsque l'ARE/ERE envisage d'exclure un groupe d'employés par rapport à un autre, cela est dit explicitement. Par exemple, la définition de l'échange de postes indique clairement que cela survient « lorsqu'un employé-e optant (non excédentaire) qui préférerait rester dans l'administration publique centrale échange son poste avec un employé-e non touché [...] ». La section 6.2.3 indique que « [s]eul l'employé-e optant, et non celui dont le poste a été déclaré excédentaire, peut être affecté à un poste non touché d'une durée indéterminée au sein de l'administration publique centrale ». Il n'existe aucune exclusion semblable entre les employés touchés et les employés optants.
[47]
Dans ses motifs, l'arbitre traite du fait de savoir si le mot « réaffectation », qui est employé à la section 1.1.5, pourrait englober les échanges de postes. En concluant qu'une réaffectation permettait de décrire une partie de la notion d'échange de postes, mais sans être synonyme de cette dernière, il a noté qu'il fallait rappeler que l'objectif même de l'ARE/ERE était de régler la question des mises en disponibilité et des éventuelles mises en disponibilité dans une situation de réaménagement des effectifs et que c'est dans ce contexte que les parties à l'ARE/ERE ont employé le mot « réaffectation ». De là, il a conclu que les systèmes que les ministères sont tenus d'établir étaient ceux qui faciliteraient la réaffectation, notamment, d'« employés touchés », une « expression comprenant les employés optants ». Il s'est donc dit convaincu que la section 1.1.5 s'appliquait au processus d'échange de postes. À mon avis, bien que la décision de l'arbitre ait porté sur la question de la réaffectation, il a aussi examiné la section 1.1.5 dans le contexte de l'objet de l'ARE/ERE dans son ensemble, ce qui concorde avec les principes de l'interprétation des conventions collectives (Ronald M. Snyder,
Collective Agreement Arbitration in Canada
(4e éd.), (LexisNexis: Canada 2009), aux pages 28 à 31).
[48]
À cet égard, les objectifs énoncés de l'ARE/ERE sont d'optimiser les possibilités d'emploi dont disposent les employés nommés pour une période indéterminée « touchés par » une situation de rajustement des effectifs, surtout en veillant à ce qu'on leur fournisse d'autres possibilités d'emploi, dans toute la mesure du possible. La section 1.1.1 indique qu'étant donné que les employés nommés pour une période indéterminée qui sont « touchés par » un réaménagement des effectifs ne sont pas eux-mêmes responsables de cette situation, il incombe aux ministères ou aux organisations de veiller à ce que ces personnes soient traitées équitablement et à ce qu'on leur offre toutes les possibilités raisonnables de poursuivre leur carrière dans la fonction publique.
[49]
Compte tenu de cela, et eu égard à la déférence à laquelle ont droit les arbitres dans les affaires de cette nature ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 37; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, aux paragraphes 23 et 35) et au fait que les employés sont tous, d'une façon ou d'une autre, « touchés par » un réaménagement des effectifs, peu importe l'issue ultime dans n'importe quelle situation donnée, il était raisonnablement loisible à l'arbitre d'interpréter que l'expression « employés touchés » englobait les « employés optants », et cette interprétation appartient aux issues possibles acceptables ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 47 et 48;
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses
, précité, au paragraphe 15).
