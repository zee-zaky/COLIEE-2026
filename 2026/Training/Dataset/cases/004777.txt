Cullen, J.
: This is an application for an order of certiorari to have a decision of nonvoluntary release from the Armed Forces reviewed and set aside due to a lack of procedural fairness. From September 30, 1980 until November 25, 1987, the applicant served as a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. At the time of his release he was based at CFB Baden in Germany. On November 25, 1987 the applicant was honourably released from the Canadian Armed Forces and it is this decision that the applicant seeks leave to have reviewed and set aside.
[2]
It is of course not this court's role to agree or disagree with the ultimate decision taken but rather to decide whether or not the applicant was accorded in all the circumstances appropriate procedural fairness respecting his dismissal. The first issue to be determined is whether or not this court lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief sought. Under s. 18 of the Federal Court Act jurisdiction to grant extraordinary remedies like certiorari is provided, but only for the review of decisions of "Federal Boards, Commissions, or other tribunals". However, s. 17(5) of the Federal Court Act is clear and the Federal Court Trial Division has jurisdiction to hear and determine an application for a writ of certiorari in relation to any member of the Canadian Armed Forces serving outside Canada. In my view this applicant fits into the "very limited case, of those members of the Canadian Forces who are serving outside Canada". (Re Quevillon (1974), 20 C.C.C.(2d) 555.)
[3]
That being decided, I then examined what relief was sought. Section 18 of the Federal Court Act provides for extraordinary remedies and gives jurisdiction to grant certiorari. However, this remedy is to be utilized only when there is no other remedy available. Ordinarily the court will not issue certiorari unless and until the applicant has exhausted all avenues of redress and appeal. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)) On the other hand this remedy is discretionary and although it is to be very carefully and prudently exercised, where the remedy is useful and will settle the question it may be granted. Certiorari is available as a general remedy for the supervision of the machinery of government decision-making. The basis for the broad reach of the remedy lies in the general duty of fairness resting on all public decision makers. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R. (3d) 385.) Since this decision of the Supreme Court (Martineau) it is clear that certiorari is not confined to decisions required to be made on a judicial or quasi-judicial basis, but that it applies whenever a public body has the power to decide any matter affecting the rights, interests, property, privileges or liberties of any person.
[4]
The applicant submits that the decision of his release was made without regard to procedural fairness. The respondent, on the other hand, submits that natural justice was observed, and on the face it may appear that there was procedural fairness: the claimant was advised that his behaviour could lead to "career action", he was given notice of the grounds supporting his release recommendation, and he was advised of his right to grieve the release decision. One of the problems I noted is that it seems his release was a fait accompli even before he was given an opportunity to respond to the evidence against him: the decision was made to release him before he was afforded the opportunity to be heard. It is also of note that the applicant was released without a Recorded Warning, nor was Counselling and Probation awarded. The expert witness for the respondent states that this was a common practice not to follow these measures in every instance. There is, however, an Armed Forces regulation which explicitly states that normally these should precede any recommendation for release based on a member's shortcomings. Thus, just because it was the custom to deny such warnings, it does not mean that the procedure was fair or proper. Again, it does not allow one to take steps to overcome these shortcomings, the very reason why these measures were put into place.
[5]
The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the general legal principle of procedural fairness, especially when making decisions that affect the rights, privileges, or interests of an individual. Here, a man's career and livelihood were at stake. Justice and fairness demand that the applicant know the case against him and that he have full opportunity to make a reply, including the opportunity to correct any relevant information that he feels is incorrect. In this case, the applicant needed the opportunity to explain himself before the final decision was made.
[6]
Lieutenant-Colonel Kenneth John Noonan (Noonan) was the applicant's Commanding Officer at CFB Baden-Soel-lingen during the period August 1986 to November 1987 (Noonan's affidavit, paragraphs 2 and 3).
[7]
On May 18, 1987, Noonan agreed to the applicant's request for an interview relating to a Recording Warning levied upon the applicant that day by one of the officers, namely Capt. J.C. Lawrence (Lawrence). This Recorded Warning is provided for in the Code of Service Discipline set out in the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5 as amended. We are told that a Recorded Warning is an administrative measure provided by Canadian Forces Administrative Orders (CFAO) that can be levied upon a Canadian Forces member whose performance or conduct is not of an acceptable standard. After meeting with the applicant, Noonan wrote a note to file respecting the interview and later met with Lawrence and two noncommissioned officers to discuss the same matter. Once again Noonan wrote a note to file. Noonan was advised of numerous administrative and attitudinal problems respecting the applicant and that he had been orally counselled respecting most of those incidents. In the final analysis, however, he gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt and had the Recorded Warning removed from his file. Later he met with both the applicant and Lawrence and again wrote a note to file. The applicant was advised that he had been involved in several incidents and Noonan was particularly distressed at the applicant's failure to fulfil alert recall duties. It was at this meeting that the applicant was advised that the Recorded Warning would be withdrawn but he was strongly warned by Noonan respecting his behaviour and was told that future divergence would be unacceptable and that in future a Recorded Warning and other career action could result. He was also advised that if he felt wronged he could submit a grievance. This apparently did not happen.
[8]
The applicant had some financial and related administrative problems and these too were brought to the attention of Noonan by Lawrence. Other actions by the applicant were also incorporated into a confidential memorandum to Noonan dated May 27, 1987. It is seen as Exhibit E to Noonan's affidavit.
[9]
We learned later that Noonan had some concern in July, 1987 about the applicant's future suitability for employment in the Canadian Forces and he prepared a letter to Dr. D.J. MacKay, Chief of Psychiatry, Canadian Forces Hospital, Europe, requesting that he interview Cpl. Diotte and make recommendations as to his future suitability in the Canadian Forces. This draft letter was never sent because the applicant had apparently sought and subsequently had an interview with Dr. MacKay. Sometime in early August Dr. MacKay telephoned Noonan to advise that in his opinion the applicant's psychiatric condition had deteriorated significantly and that he should undergo further psychiatric tests at the National Defence Medical Centre (NDMC) in Ottawa, Canada. Noonan's affidavit is replete with problems that he, his officers, and NCO's were having with the applicant and not too much is to be gained here by reciting them all.
[10]
Two matters, in my view, should be mentioned here. After undergoing psychiatric tests in Ottawa, the end result was that the applicant had no psychiatric disability, he was responsible for his actions and any and all behavioral abberations of the applicant were secondary to his personality style. On those grounds Dr. MacKay recommended that consideration be given to the administrative release of the applicant from the Canadian Forces. The other matter involves the applicant's request to join a particular unit training at Camp Borden in Ontario and arrangements were made so that he could take this particular course. On arrival he refused and cited a reason which the affidavit evidence seems to indicate was not substantiated.
[11]
In the final analysis Noonan received on October 9, 1987 from Lawrence a memorandum recommending compulsory release of the applicant from the Canadian Forces.
[12]
Earlier, October 6, 1987, the applicant wanted the appointment of one Capt. Morgan (Morgan) as his Assisting Officer. Although the first advice was that Capt. Morgan could not be made available, Noonan personally intervened to ensure the services of Capt. Morgan would be available to the applicant.
[13]
Lawrence's memorandum was the catalyst which moved Noonan to prepare a memorandum for Col. A.M. DeQuetteville, the Base Commander. Before that memorandum was completed and sometime in about mid-October 1987, Morgan requested a meeting with Noonan respecting the applicant. Morgan, notwithstanding Lawrence's report and recommendations, indicated that he, Morgan, would be willing to take the applicant permanently into his unit. Notwithstanding Morgan's representations, Noonan indicated that in his view the applicant was unsuitable for continued service in the Canadian Forces and that his then current good behaviour was of only a temporary nature. He advised Morgan that the applicant was a destructive force in a unit with a history of aggressive belligerent behaviour towards peers and superiors which was detrimental to a unit's good order and discipline and that because of such incidents he was an administrative "headache" to the Canadian Forces.
[14]
Morgan made representations that in his view the applicant should be placed on Recorded Warning or on Counselling and Probation first but Noonan was not convinced. Noonan also outlined his reasons for supporting the recommendation that the applicant be released. Finally, at the end of the meeting, Morgan was told that Noonan would formally advise the applicant of his recommendation once he had completed a report on this subject to the Base Commander. The memorandum was completed and forwarded to the Base Commander on or about October 22, 1987 with the recommendation that the applicant be released from the Canadian Forces. The final decision had to be made by the Base Commander, DeQuetteville.
[15]
I am satisfied that throughout the process Noonan did everything he conceivably could do to assure the applicant fairness in the procedures followed. Noonan agreed to a request for an interview by the applicant following a Recorded Warning levied against him. Following that interview, Noonan then met with Lawrence and two noncommissioned officers to discuss the same matter. He then followed this up with a second interview at which both the applicant and Lawrence were present. He prepared a note to file and he put the applicant on notice that because of his involvement in several incidents and one in particular, he was warned about his behaviour, told that future divergence would be unacceptable and he was advised that a Recorded Warning and other career action could result. Noonan, however, did direct that the Recorded Warning be withdrawn from the file. Noonan received a further memorandum from Lawrence respecting some financial and related administrative problems of the applicant. It was really a summary of previous information already known and then later Noonan, after reviewing all of his notes, removed from the applicant's file the Recorded Warning earlier referred to plus a personal letter to the applicant and a medical matter which, in the opinion of Noonan, should not be on a personal file. This indicated to me an attempt, and a serious one, to remain unbiased and as fair as possible to the applicant. Noonan later acceded to a request from the applicant to take a particular course at Camp Borden, which the applicant eventually refused to commence, refused instructions to do so and in the process seems to have lied to superior officers. Noonan was concerned about the applicant's mental health and in keeping with Dr. MacKay's recommendations, had him sent to NDMC and while this assessment was taking place, Noonan was fair again in that he did not move against the applicant until he was satisfied that the applicant had no psychiatric problems.
[16]
Throughout, in my view, Noonan conducted himself in an honest, forthright and reasonable fashion.
[17]
Unhappily, however, it is my considered opinion that the Base Commander should have permitted the applicant and Morgan, as his Assisting Officer, to make representations before the final decision was made by the Base Commander to discharge the applicant from the Canadian Forces. I can understand the applicant's surprise that this was not in fact done and to me it is a breach of the procedural fairness required on a matter as important as this was to the applicant.
[18]
One other comment should be made here. The respondent argued that the applicant should have used the grievance procedure and because he had access to that procedure the court lacks jurisdiction. The first time Noonan told the applicant that he could use the grievance procedure, there was really no need to because the Recorded Warning had been removed. On the second occasion Noonan suggested that he had a right to the grievance procedure but that would have to take place on "civvy street". The applicant did consult counsel, one Ms. Martha Coady, and all his records were handed over to her. The applicant applied to Labour Canada for relief from his release but Labour Canada responded that it was without jurisdiction to assist him. We have an affidavit from Col. Raymond Gerard Hurley who was Director, Personal Career Administration, Other Ranks, who was a senior member of the permanent headquarters staff of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). He advised us that s. 18 of the National Defence Act has the ultimate authority as to whether a Canadian Forces (CF) member should be released and whether a former CF member who has been released by a CF authority, supported by the CDS, should be reengaged by the Canadian Forces. Although we are assured this is a very comprehensive procedure, and I have no doubt that Col. Hurley and his people were very thorough, this s. 18 review cannot and does not overcome the procedural unfairness of the Base Commander who did not permit the applicant and his Assisting Officer to make representations before the Base Commander's final decision was made.
[19]
For the reasons stated above, I find that this court does have jurisdiction to hear the issue. An order by way of certiorari will go to set aside the decision of Col. A.M. DeQuetteville, Base Commander, which decision officially dismissed the applicant from the Canadian Forces. The applicant is entitled to his costs.
Application allowed.
