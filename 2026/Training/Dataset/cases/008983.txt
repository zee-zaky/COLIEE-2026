Dubé, J. [Translation]
: The plaintiffs ("Pro-Vertic") are seeking to invalidate Canadian patent 1,215,907 ("patent 907") of the defendant ("I.D. C.") on the ground that the invention claimed by the said patent was apparent to a specialist at the time of the invention. It was common ground that this date is June 16, 1982.
[2]
I.D.C., for its part, denied the invalidity and by a counterclaim alleged that claims 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 15 of its patent were infringed by Pro-Vertic.
[3]
To begin with, therefore, I must decide whether patent 907 is valid. If it is, I will then have to determine whether Pro-Vertic infringed it. It should be noted at the outset that any patent is to be regarded as prima facie valid under the provisions of s. 45 of the Patent Act [see footnote 1]. The burden of establishing that patent 907 is invalid rests with Pro-Vertic in the case at bar and, according to well-settled precedent, such a burden is "not easy to overcome" [see footnote 2]. My first task therefore is to identify the monopoly protected by the patent. To do this the courts have laid down certain rules of interpretation that can be used to indicate the limits of the monopoly in question. In particular, Fox sets out the following rules in Canadian Patent Law and Practice (4th Ed.), p. 215.
"Rules of Construction: The first duty of the court in a patent action is to construe the claims in suit according to the recognized canons of construction. These are as follows:
(1) The claims are to be construed with reference to the entire specification.
(2) The claims are to be construed without reference to the prior art.
(3) Each claim is, if possible, to be given a distinct meaning.
(4) What is not claimed is disclaimed."
[4]
Before undertaking to interpret a patent one has to place oneself in the shoes of a specialist. In other words, the object is not to pass the text through a fine literary sieve to remove flaws, nor to play the devil's advocate and attempt to identify grounds of confusion. The primary purpose is to discover what the patent says to a specialist in the area. To this end my brother Addy, J., wrote the following in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the texts, must resist the temptation of deliberately searching for the remote possibility of confusion. On the contrary, it is trite to state that the claims and indeed the whole teaching of the patent, must be considered as being directed to a mind both skilled in the art and willing to understand the true and fair meaning of the text."
[5]
Patent 907 protects the invention of a process for elevating a wheel chair. Its title is "Elevator Device For Wheel Chair and Wheel Chair Incorporating Same". It was issued to I.D.C., a French company, on December 31, 1986 and the inventor is Bernard Pillot, also of France. As stated in the specification, the invention concerns a wheel chair for handicapped or invalid people. The specification sets out the obvious and unquestioned benefits resulting from a wheel chair that allows the occupant to go easily from a sitting to a standing position, without great effort. The purpose of the invention is to provide a practical and real solution for the problems of a handicapped person by offering a simple, strong and adjustable mechanism which is also safe and reliable.
[6]
As stated in the specification, the purpose of the invention is also to eliminate the need for any auxiliary or additional source of energy to enable the handicapped person to elevate himself, without the aid of a motor or some other person. The solution offered rests on a principle involving a lever and two flexible quadrilaterals. Control is provided using a cylinder or elastic device to counterbalance the weight of the user. However, it is common ground and well-settled law that what is protected by a patent monopoly is contained not in the specification but in the claims. The relevant claims in the case at bar are as follows:
"1. An elevator device for a chair structure having a frame, and a seat, a backrest, and a footrest, movable between a first, sitting position and a second, standing position, the elevator device comprising:
(A) a first quadrilateral link mechanism attached to each side of the seat and pivotally attached to the frame;
(B) a second quadrilateral link mechanism attached to each side of the footrest and attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism and pivotally attached to the frame;
(C) a trilateral link mechanism attached to each side of the backrest and pivotally attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism;
(D) manually operable maneuvering linkages located on each side of the chair structure, each comprising:
(i) a lever pivotally attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism at a first pivot point;
(ii) a rod; and,
(iii) first means pivotally connecting the rod to the lever at a second pivot point and second means pivotally connecting the rod to the frame at a third pivot point, such that in the first, sitting position, the first pivot point is below a line passing through the second and third pivot points and, in the second, standing position, the second pivot point is above a line passing through the first and third pivot points so as to form an overcenter locking mechanism in each position; and
(E) an elastic member interposed between the first quadrilateral link mechanism and the frame to counterbalance the weight of the user during movement between the sitting and standing positions.
"2. The elevator device according to claim 1 further comprising a stop catch attached to the lever so as to contact the rod to limit the lowering motion of the device and define the first, sitting position.
"3. The elevator device according to claim 1 wherein the lever comprises first and second lever arms, the first pivot point located at the juncture of the lever arms and the second pivot point being located adjacent the distal end of the second lever arm.
. . . . .
"7. The elevator device according to claim 1 wherein the elastic member comprises a gas actuated jack.
. . . . .
"9. A wheel chair for an invalid or handicapped person comprising:
(A) a frame;
(B) a plurality of wheels rotatably attached to the frame;
(C) a seat;
(D) a backrest;
(E) a footrest;
(F) a first quadrilateral link mechanism attached to each side of the seat and pivotally attached to the frame;
(G) a second quadrilateral link mechanism attached to each side of the footrest and attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism and pivotally attached to the frame;
(H) a trilateral link mechanism attached to each side of the backrest and pivotally attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism;
(I) manually operable maneuvering linkages located on each side of the wheel chair, each comprising:
(i) a lever pivotally attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism at a first pivot point;
(ii) a rod; and,
(iii) first means pivotally connecting the rod to the lever at a second pivot point and second means pivotally connecting the rod to the frame at a third pivot point, such that in the first, sitting position, the first pivot point is below a line passing through the second and third pivot points and, in the second, standing position, the second pivot point is above the line passing through the first and third pivot points so as to form an overcenter locking mechanism in each position; and,
(J) an elastic member interposed between the first quadrilateral link mechanism and the frame to counterbalance the weight of the user during movement between the sitting and standing positions.
"10. The wheel chair according to claim 9 further comprising a stop catch attached to the lever so as to contact the rod to limit the lowering motion of the device and define the first, sitting position.
"11. The wheel chair according to claim 9 wherein the lever comprises first and second lever arms, the first pivot point located at the juncture of the lever arms and the second pivot point being located adjacent the distal end of the second lever arm.
. . . . .
"15. The wheel chair according to claim 9 wherein the elastic member comprises a gas actuated jack."
[7]
According to the foregoing claims, therefore, the invention consists principally of the articulation of two quadrilaterals mounted on the footrest and frame which are joined to each other in an articulated manner, the articulation resulting from the combined action of a number of manoeuvres initiated by the operator and an elastic member allowing the seat and footrest to be adjusted in two positions, one seated and the other elevated, and a handicapped person to be in stable seated and standing positions in complete safety.
[8]
Drawings fig. 1 and fig. 3 attached to the patent illustrate the points mentioned in the specifications and repeated in the claims, and indicate the components in seated and standing positions.
[Diagrams omitted. See printed version.]
[9]
As mentioned above, Pro-Vertic challenged the validity of patent 907 on the ground that the alleged invention, as claimed, was clear to a specialist in view of the common knowledge publicly available in the field of flexible geometry on the date on which the invention was made, that is in June 1982. Pro-Vertic referred in particular in its statement of claim to some 29 U.S. and 5 European patents as making up the relevant prior art.
[10]
These patents, together with patent 907 at issue and a Pro-Vertic 2000 wheel chair (manufactured by the plaintiff), were given to Prof. T. Vu Khanh, as an expert, to determine the alleged ingenuity of the patent 907 invention on the one hand and to compare the claims of patent 907 with the Pro-Vertic 2000 wheel chair on the other.
[11]
Prof. Vu Khanh, an engineer, is an assistant professor at the polytechnic school of the University of Montreal. He holds several engineering degrees from the Universities of Paris and Compiègne. He is a mechanical engineer who specializes in the ruin of mechanical structures. Before doing this he had no special knowledge or experience in the field of wheel chairs, elevating or otherwise. For comparison purposes he in fact used 16 U.S. patents dating from 1964 to 1981. "Depending on the means used to activate the movement of the seat, back and footrest", he classified the patent into three groups, namely "control by hydraulic jacks, by a rack-and-pinion system linked to an electric motor and control by the lever and flexible quadrilateral principle". Patent 907 falls into the last class.
[12]
In his analysis, Prof. Vu Khanh found that claim 1 of patent 907 comprises "four" (actually five) components, and he identified each of these five components separately in a number of U.S. patents. He made the same comparisons for the other relevant claims. From this he drew the following conclusion:
"
Conclusion
"The invention claimed in patent 1,215,907 uses well-known principles of classical mechanics. The components of this claim, as described in the claim read in light of the specifications, are contained in several earlier patents and in a number of examples currently applied, including products for domestic use."
[13]
On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that this is a combination patent. An invention may be more than each of the components that go to make it up. Any proper analysis of a combination patent must therefore deal with the monopoly as a whole, and not be limited to each of its parts. As Fox points out in the text cited above [see footnote 4], there are two classes of invention, that of methods of applying a new principle and that of a new method of applying an old principle:
"As already pointed out, for the purpose of considering subject matter, inventions fall broadly into two classes. This classification becomes of some importance when considering the question of infringement and it is necessary, in each case, to decide into which class any patent under examination will fall. First, there is the invention of a method of application of a new principle, and secondly, there is the invention of a new method of application of an old principle. As was said by Kay, L.J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  patentee has invented a new method of producing a known result, the other where he has invented a new result, and has described one method of producing it.'"
[14]
This, of course, is a new method of applying an old principle. As Prof. Vu Khanh wrote in his report (at page 6):
"... Flexible quadrilaterals are well-known components of mechanics and are regularly used. This principle is used when the object is, by a known and controlled movement, to transmit two simultaneous movements (often a displacement and a rotation) to another part of the whole. A multi-position office lamp or a folding lawn chair are simple examples of application of the flexible quadrilateral."
[15]
Counsel for Pro-Vertic referred the court to the rule in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  particular this quotation from Wood, J.:
"... I think it extremely important to follow the rule laid down in ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to that particular mechanical device which he has claimed for effecting the object he had in view; and if he says it is to be done in one precise and particular way, to that precise and particular way he must be held; and those who have bona fide employed a different system and a different way must not be held to have infringed."
[16]
It follows that combination patent 907, involving the articulation of two quadrilaterals resulting from the combined action of the operator and an elastic member, must be looked at as a whole. It may be valid even if each of its components is to be found elsewhere in the prior art. Clearly, the monopoly of such a patent must be limited to its special mechanism, as we will see below regarding the alleged infringement by Pro-Vertic.
[17]
For its part, I.D.C. called as an expert witness Anthony Staros, from New York, U.S.A., a professional engineer who is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cornell, Stanford and Hofstra Universities. His curriculum vitae shows considerable experience in the field of prostheses, and in particular wheel chairs. He worked for the U.S. Veterans Affairs Department from 1949 to 1982. He held the position of technical director and rehabilitation director in that Department. In 1976 and 1978 he organized the first two national workshops on the design of wheel chairs. His duties since 1965 have required him to keep informed on the latest aspects of the design, operation and performance of all available types of wheel chairs.
[18]
At the hearing Mr. Staros testified that he had already met with over sixty engineers and other competent scientists in the field of wheel chair design to ask them to invent a device whereby a wheel chair could elevate without the aid of a motor or another person, and met with very little success. The only mechanism suggested to him was a cranking system and series of chain drives on sprockets, on pivots. He therefore regarded the wheel chair displayed to him by I.D.C. for the first time as "unique" and "revolutionary".
[19]
Additionally, in paragraph 16 of his report Mr. Staros described why it is not easy to arrive at such an invention:
"16. To be practical, a wheel chair incorporating an elevating device must be safe, comfortable, easy to operate for the occupant, affordable, foldable for auto transport, relatively light and uncumbursome [sic]. Unless particular care is taken in arriving at a satisfactory design, the objectives above will not be achieved. Many have tried, few have succeeded."
[20]
Subsequently, in paragraph 19, he indicated what in his opinion is the substance of the invention described in patent 907, as understood by a specialist:
"19. Patent 907 describes and claims a wheel chair to be used by a permanently handicapped person, incorporating a lifting device constructed to achieve the above-mentioned objectives and incorporates a unique design in lifting forces and movements. Even though, as any other wheel chair incorporating a lifting device, it cannot be considered an universal solution suitable for all and in all situations, it is definitively a step forward in the art and an improvement over previous wheel chairs incorporating a lifting device."
[21]
He explained in paragraph 25 how patent 907 meets the aforementioned concerns and solves the problem:
"25. Thus, we can see from patent 907 that we are presented with a wheel chair which is still a wheel chair for both short and long ranging in a horizontal plane. Its foldability and relative compactness after folding, basically due to the uniqueness of its design, preserve the requisites for the basic mobility situations. Moreover, it does not depend on extrinsic power per se to effect movement from sitting to standing nor to control descent. Instead, it uses an adjustable counterforce to weight to yield a lower level of body power for both functions giving the occupant a great sense of control over his/her body movement. And rather than finger and hand control of valves modulating external power sources, patent 907 calls for a grosser occupant input, giving greater proprioception and feedback in the control of movement. The upper torso and upper limb 'motors' give the occupant greater mastery of his equipment. Moreover, once either fully seated or fully standing, the mechanism of patent 907 offers a unique system of shifting lever and rod pivots to effect virtual locking of the elevator's kinematic system."
[22]
The expert witness Staros accordingly considered that patent 907 gives the specialist a solution to the objective of elevating a wheel chair without the aid of a motor or another person. This is a result which he said had not been obtained by the prior art. He considered and rejected U.S. patents offering elevation but with the aid of a motor.
[23]
The only other patent for elevating a wheel chair without the aid of a motor is the U.S. Hodge patent, 3,640,566, issued in 1972. Of all the patents discussed by the two expert witnesses, this undoubtedly is closest to patent 907. According to the specification of this patent the invention can be applied either to a mobile or immobile chair, and the mobile chair can be, for example, a wheel chair arranged to be operated by a patient. On the other hand, it is the description for a wheel chair "arranged to be operated by a person other than a patient" (page 1, line 57 of the patent) which is supplied and illustrated in the patent. Accordingly, the claims and drawings do not contemplate a wheel chair operated by a handicapped person without the aid of another. For example, it is hard to see how a handicapped person could reach the lever located behind the seat. This patent does not contemplate a manual lever. Additionally, the check device of the Hodge patent must be operated by a third person, not by the occupant. What the Hodge patent actually contemplates is an interlocking roller with five check positions, which cannot be conveniently reached by a handicapped person whether seated or standing. Patent 907, on the other hand, offers two positions which can readily be operated by a handicapped person.
[24]
According to the testimony of Mr. Staros, and I see no reason to doubt his credibility, scientists who met in the U.S. at his request to create an elevating wheel chair without a motor and without the aid of a third person had all the patents to date available to them, including those referred to at the hearing of the case at bar (and so including the Hodge patent), and were unable to produce a device giving the occupant the necessary effectiveness and freedom of operation without the aid of an external agency.
[25]
I must also note that Mr. Normand Julien, a leading figure in Pro-Vertic, himself testified that he was "dazzled by French ingenuity" in respect of the I.D.C. wheel chair invention. He frankly and honestly admitted that "being able to raise people without using a motor is quite revolutionary". In fact, he used this laudatory language in a circular letter to his customers when Pro-Vertic was selling the defendant I.D.C.'s "Live It Up" wheel chair. We will return to this point.
[26]
At the hearing counsel for Pro-Vertic sought to enter in evidence a transcript of the examination on discovery of the inventor of patent 907, Bernard Pillot, with the clear purpose of attempting to show that he had not really demonstrated any inventive capacity. Counsel for I.D.C. objected to this exhibit and I allowed his objection, for the following reasons.
[27]
Rule 465(5) of the Federal Court specifies that the assignor of a patent of invention (the inventor) may be examined for discovery by the adverse party. Under rule 465(16), upon the examination for discovery of a person under subs. (5) that person must answer any relevant question. The purpose of such an examination is to enable the adverse party to be better informed about the case it must answer. However, as this examination is not voluntary, it cannot be filed as evidence at the hearing unless allowed by a special rule of the court. Rule 494(9) allows a party to use in evidence against another party any part of the examination for discovery served on that other party. This rule does not authorize entering in evidence the examination for discovery of a third person, in this case the inventor [see footnote 6]. The person who testified at the examination for discovery on behalf of the defendant I.D.C. was Mrs. Nicole Pillot, wife of the inventor and president of I.D.C. Counsel for Pro-Vertic had the impression that counsel for I.D.C. would agree to the filing of the transcript of the inventor's examination in integrum. However, it appears from reading the relevant passages that counsel for I.D.C. agreed only to admit the parts of the inventor's examination dealing with the prior art. These are accordingly the only passages which could be entered in evidence.
[28]
For all these reasons, therefore, I must conclude that the plaintiff has not discharged the burden upon it of showing that patent 907 held by the defendant is invalid. Having thus confirmed the validity of the said patent, I must now determine whether the claims at issue were infringed by Pro-Vertic.
[29]
Deciding whether there has been an infringement is a mixed question of law and fact, in the sense that interpreting a patent is a question of law and what an infringer does is a question of fact. The decided cases have held that in interpreting a patent the court must attempt to give it the application which will protect the invention as described in good faith [see footnote 7]. There is an infringement when the essential components of an invention have been appropriated by the infringer [see footnote 8]. It is also well-established that an infringement is not assessed by comparing the product of the invention to the product of the infringer, but by comparing the infringer's product to the patent of invention, and in particular to its claims.
[30]
Fundamentally, it must be determined whether the infringer has taken the "pith and marrow" of the invention. Where a combination patent is in question, as is clearly the case here, for there to be an infringement the alleged infringer must have essentially taken over all and several the essential components of the combination as claimed.
[31]
It is also well-settled that the principle of equivalence applies only to nonessential components [see footnote 9]. In a combination patent, a person obtaining the same results by using the essential components of the combination is an infringer, even if he has actually altered the combination or combination procedure by omitting or substituting certain nonessential components. In short, the doctrine of equivalence is only a way of expressing substantial infringement. What the inventor wishes to protect is the essential components [see footnote 10].
[32]
Having stated these rules, it is now worth reviewing as briefly as possible the facts which led to the alleged infringement.
[33]
Messrs. Normand Julien et Clément Proulx, businessmen in the Drummondville, Quebec area, headed the Agroplus Company, a farm machinery manufacturer, and were interested in diversifying their business. In November 1984 they were approached by the Canadian Industrial Renewal Board, seeking to interest them in joining with a French company specializing in the manufacture of equipment for the handicapped. The Board was prepared to grant them subsidies under the federal "C.I.D." program, for up to 75 percent of the preparatory cost and 50 percent of the capital investment cost. The said subsidies applied only to manufacture and did not cover the sale in Canada of products manufactured elsewhere.
[34]
In March 1985 Mr. Julien of Pro-Vertic met for the first time with Mrs. Nicole Pillot of I.D.C., visited the "Live It Up" elevating wheel chair factory and said he was "dazzled by the system, by the ingenuity of the invention". They both met again in Canada in May 1985 and arrived at a distribution contract for Canada only. Pro-Vertic, on the one hand, sought a manufacturing licence that would make it available for the aforementioned subsidies and a distribution contract for the U.S., so as to extend its market. I.D.C., on the other hand, was looking for a partner ready to undertake sales in order to acquire experience in the wheel chair market. Clearly the two parties were not on the same wavelength. I.D.C. then made an offer which Mrs. Pillot described at the hearing as a "discouragement" proposal, requiring Pro-Vertic to invest $2,000,000 and sell 30,000 wheel chairs a year.
[35]
Relations between the two parties grew worse. The first contract was not renewed. Court proceedings were begun in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec. On December 30, 1986, patent 907 was issued. The action at bar was brought. In the meantime, Pro-Vertic sold off the 23 I.D.C. wheel chairs received for sale in Canada and began producing its own elevating wheel chair, the "Pro-Vertic 2000". It has now to be determined whether this wheel chair infringes the aforementioned claims of patent 907.
[36]
In the second part of his report, the expert witness Vu Khanh compared claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 of patent 907 with the Pro-Vertic 2000 wheel chairs. For claim 1, he compared the "four" (actually five) principal components of this claim with those of the Pro-Vertic wheel chair.
[37]
First, both wheel chairs have a first flexible quadrilateral to contribute to the support of the seat.
[38]
Second, both wheel chairs have a second flexible quadrilateral, with the difference that the Pro-Vertic one is removable or detachable from the frame, unlike the second quadrilateral of patent 907, which pivots in relation to the frame. (We will return to this point.)
[39]
Third, the Pro-Vertic 2000 wheel chair does not have a trilateral as described in patent 907, but consists of a single adjustable bar. (It is common ground that this trilateral is not necessary for the invention.)
[40]
Fourth, both wheel chairs have a system of articulations for manual control of pivoting, comprising a lever and shaft connected to each other and to the wheel chair, allowing the necessary articulation to go from the seated to the vertical position. However, the expert will detect certain differences. Patent 907 specifies that in a seated position the first articulation point is below a straight line between the second and third articulation point, while in the Pro-Vertic wheel chair the first articulation point is above the straight line. Second, patent 907 specifies that in the upright position the second articulation point will be above a straight line between the first and third articulation points, while this characteristic is very difficult to identify on the Pro-Vertic wheel chair. (We will return below to these articulation or pivot points.)
[41]
Fifth, both wheel chairs have an elastic device, a gas cylinder for the purpose of counterbalancing the user's weight.
[42]
On claim 2, the expert witness Vu Khanh noted that the Pro-Vertic wheel chair has a stop catch to limit the downward movement of the wheel chair.
[43]
On claim 3, the lever on the Pro-Vertic wheel chair is in two sections, one to receive the force and the other to transmit it.
[44]
Mr. Vu Khanh regarded claim 7 as the same as claim 1.
[45]
He drew the following conclusion about the infringement:
"Additionally, there are certain resemblances between the components of the Pro-Vertic 2000 wheel chairs and the invention claimed in the patent. However, several differences were also noted."
[46]
The expert witness Anthony Staros, for his part, reviewed the components of patent 907 and found them to exist in the Pro-Vertic wheel chair. Paragraphs 33 and 34 of his report are worth reproducing:
"33. From my reviewing of the above-mentioned material, I came to the following conclusion:
Pro-Vertic chair structure has a frame, a seat, a backrest, a footrest and is equipped with an elevating device, allowing the occupant to move from a sitting to a standing position.
"The elevating device comprises:
(a) A first quadrilateral link mechanism attached to each side of the seat and pivotally attached to the frame;
(b) A second quadrilateral link mechanism attached to each side of the footrest and attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism and pivotally attached to the frame. Even though the footrest can be removed from the chair, it is nevertheless 'attached' to the first quadrilateral and to the frame. As I understand it, the important characteristic is that the second deformable quadrilateral must be articulated on the first quadrilateral and on the frame to allow the elevating function (see patent 907, page 3, lines 14 and 15). The second quadrilateral is not permanently attached to the footrest and to the frame but is nevertheless attached. This has not changed the function of the elevating device.
(c) An element attached to each side of the backrest and pivotally attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism. One bar in the trilateral part of patent 907 has been eliminated by Pro-Vertic, but this has not changed the function of the element used as a replacement, i.e., contributing to the support of the backrest.
(d) Manually operable maneuvering linkages located on each side of the chair structure, each comprising:
i. a lever pivotally attached to the first quadrilateral link mechanism at a first pivot point;
ii. a rod;
iii. the rod is pivotally connected to the lever and to the frame. In view of the relative alignment of the three pivot points, the Pro-Vertic chair exhibits less locking effectiveness from an 'overcenter' locking mechanism, but in each position it still develops in an identical linkage, a colinearity of pivot points and thus a locking effect almost identical to the alignment shown in Figures 1 and 3 of patent 907.
(e) An elastic member interposed between the first quadrilateral link mechanism and the frame to counterbalance the weight of the user during movement between the sitting and standing positions, said elastic member comprising a gas actuated jack.
(f) A stop catch attached to the lever so as to contact the rod to limit the lowering motion of the device and define the sitting position.
(g) The lever comprises first and second lever arms, the first pivot point being located at the juncture of the lever arms and the second pivot point located adjacent the distal end of the second lever arm.
(h) Pro-Vertic chair is a wheel chair for an invalid or handicapped person also comprising a plurality of wheels, rotatably attached to the frame.
"34. In conclusion, it is my opinion that the Pro-Vertic chair has an elevating system identical in concept to the I.D.C. chair. I offer this opinion on the basis of my knowledge of all other vertical rise chairs. These two chairs constitute a conceptually matched pair in the array which includes all such chairs, to wit:
a. Both chairs use the same basic type of body-powered linkages with an assist from gas or spring piston-cylinder force actuators to provice [sic] a counterbalancing movement. The configurations and dimensions in the kinematic system are functionally twins. One element, the one bar in the trilateral part of I.D.C.'s patent designation has been eliminated by Pro-Vertic but this has not changed the functional product. It is true that the Pro-Vertic chair exhibits less locking effectiveness from an 'overcenter' locking mechanism, but in the seated or standing position, it still develops in an identical linkage a colinearity of pivot points and thus a locking effect almost identical to the alignment shown in Figures 1 and 3 of Patent 907 and exhibited on I.D.C. chairs;
b. Pro-Vertic has adopted I.D.C.'s unique design features in the adjustability of chair dimensioning and lifting forces and movement. The adjustments to fit the chair's geometry to the dimensions and weight of the occupant are so similar that a reasonable person would consider them a matched pair among the older commercial systems used in occupant lifting."
[47]
It should be noted that the Pro-Vertic wheel chair was designed by Mr. Clément Proulx at the request of Mr. Normand Julien, when Pro-Vertic wanted to market an elevating wheel chair to replace the I.D.C. wheel chair. According to his own testimony, Mr. Proulx tried to make corrections or modifications based on a drawing of the I.D.C. wheel chair and two other patents (the Levo and Imex patents). He also said that the principal improvements he made to the wheel chair consisted of knee supports, thoracic supports, moving the levers forward and adding automatic latches as locks. He confirmed to the court that these were the four main modifications added by him to the I.D.C. wheel chair. It is common ground that the first two modifications are not relevant to the patent. The patent also does not refer to locking latches.
[48]
It thus follows that the only relevant change made by Mr. Proulx to the I.D.C. wheel chair is the moving forward of the two levers (or arms) to make them more accessible by a handicapped person. The arms in question were thus moved forward by some two or three inches. According to Mr. Proulx, in order to move the arm forward he had to shift the pivot points. During Mr. Proulx's cross-examination I suggested that it would have been much simpler to lengthen the arms instead of moving them forward, and achieve the same results. The answer to this question did not seem satisfactory. Additionally, the engineer Staros, an expert engineer in the design of wheel chairs, confirmed that the configuration of the arm could have been changed by lengthening, without changing the geometry of the pivot points.

The expert witness Vu Khanh and Mr. Julien also placed great emphasis on the difference between the Pro-Vertic wheel chair and the claim of patent 907, namely that claim 1(b) states that the second quadrilateral is "attached" to the first and to the frame, while the second quadrilateral of the Pro-Vertic wheel chair is detachable. (The quadrilateral in question is in fact also detachable from the wheel chair manufactured by I.D. C.) In this regard it should be noted that claim 1(b) does not state how the quadrilateral is to be attached. Being attached does not mean being permanently attached. A component can be both attached and detachable. This is the very essence of the latter adjective.

As already mentioned, Pro-Vertic considered there was another difference between its wheel chair and claim 1(d)(ii) of patent 907, with regard to the pivot: in a seated position on the Pro-Vertic wheel chair the central point is highest and in an upright position it is lowest. The testimony of the expert witness Vu Khanh certainly did not persuade me that this minor difference in the relative position of the pivot points substantially distinguishes the two articulation systems. In both cases there is a blocking device in the seated and upright positions. This blocking device is not the result only of friction, but also of the fact that the central pivot point is so close to the alignment that the blocking is guaranteed. According to the expert witness Staros, the three points are located on almost the same line, thus ensuring easy retention.

As this is a combination patent, the question is whether Pro-Vertic adopted the pith and marrow of the I.D.C. invention. My answer must be in the affirmative. I think it is clear that Pro-Vertic simply reproduced each of the essential components of the claims of patent 907. The modifications mentioned above, which were made by Mr. Proulx, are of a nonessential nature or not relevant to the patent. There was therefore an infringement.

The action is accordingly dismissed and the counterclaim allowed. Canadian patent 1,215,907 is declared valid. Claims 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 15 were infringed by the plaintiff. The latter is hereby directed to cease the said infringement. Damages will be subject to reference, the whole with costs.
Action dismissed;
Counterclaim allowed.
