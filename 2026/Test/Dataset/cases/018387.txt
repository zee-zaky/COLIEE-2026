I.
Preliminary
[1]
Shore, J.
[Translation]: The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) correctly found following a thorough analysis that the case of the Afghani applicant is one of lack of credibility with flagrant ambiguity, contradictions and inconsistencies resulting in gaps.
II.
Introduction
[2]
This is an application for judicial review of a decision rendered on January 7, 2013, by the RPD, in which the Board found that the applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under section 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA).
III.
Facts
[3]
The applicant, Shahid Ahmadzai, is a citizen of Afghanistan, born in Logar in 1988.
[4]
The applicant stated that at the age of 13 (in September 2002), his father and his brother were allegedly killed by unknown murderers in Logar and that the applicant and his mother and brother went to live with his uncle in Kabul shortly after the incident.
[5]
The applicant explained that in 2002 and 2003, unknown persons allegedly followed him in Kabul on two occasions. He believes that these unknown persons are the same ones that killed some members of his family. He stated that they also knocked on his door frequently and threw rocks at his windows during the night.
[6]
The applicant stated that he arrived in Canada on September 21, 2009, and filed his refugee claim on September 23, 2009. Since the applicant had no identification documents in his possession at the time of his application, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) immediately detained him.
[7]
On October 27, 2009, after three detention reviews, the applicant testified before the Immigration Division (ID) of the Board that his real name was "Aimal Wafa". The applicant testified that he changed his name because of his fear of murderers targeting members of his family to be able to play for the national cricket team in Afghanistan. (This admission only arose after a CBSA offer asked him if he was one of the members of the cricket team that had recently fled Afghanistan and had claimed refugee status in Canada.) The applicant also testified that he lied with respect to his age and itinerary (see hearing transcript of October 27, 2009).
[8]
On November 10, 2009, the applicant was released by the CBSA because it was satisfied as to his identity.
[9]
On January 7, 2013, the RPD rejected the applicant's refugee claim.
IV.
Decision under judicial review
[10]
In its decision, the RPD determined that Mr. Ahmadzai's version of the facts was not credible.
[11]
The RPD found that there were several inconsistencies in his story for which no satisfactory explanation was provided. The RPD felt that the following elements undermined the applicant's credibility with respect to his fear of his family members' murderers:
a) First, the applicant could not at all explain satisfactorily why he had stated in his port of entry statement that he feared being killed by the Taliban, after indicating that he feared [translation] "unknown" persons in his Personal Information Form (PIF) and his testimony. The applicant also could not explain why he was the only member of his family living to be targeted by these unknown persons. Further, he did not provide any evidence to confirm that his father and brother had indeed been killed;
b) Second, the applicant had not indicated in his original PIF or amended PIF that he had complained to the police in Kabul after being followed by unknown persons. On the contrary, in his original PIF, he stated that he had not gone to the police since they were all connected to the Taliban. In his amended PIF, the applicant did not say anything about his complaint. The applicant only stated that he complained to the police when he filed his documentary evidence for the hearing of January 7, 2013.
[12]
Regarding the applicant's fear of the government of Afghanistan because of his refugee claim in Canada, the RPD found that the applicant was also not credible.
[13]
First, the RPD determined that the applicant's allegation that he had to change his name to Aimal Wafa in 2005 because he allegedly was afraid to be discovered by the Taliban was implausible, since none of the other members of his family living in Afghanistan were troubled by these unknown persons and had wanted to change their names. Given the concerns relating to the applicant's credibility, the RPD gave little weight to his explanation relating to his name change.
[14]
Similarly, the RPD found there was no connection between the applicant and Aimal Wafa; the applicant had not submitted any credible evidence that he was Aimal Wafa. The RPD noted that the only similarity between the applicant and Aimal Wafa was that the two were cricket players and arrived in Canada around the same date.
[15]
The RPD added that, even if it had believed that the applicant was indeed Aimal Wafa, there was no evidence on the record that showed an objective basis of risk that the applicant would be persecuted by the government of Afghanistan. The RPD found that it was implausible that the applicant would be persecuted by that government for deserting his sports team in claiming refugee status in Canada.
V.
Issue
[16]
Was the RPD's credibility analysis reasonable?
VI.
Relevant statutory provisions
[17]
Sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA apply in this case:
Convention refugee
96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(
b
) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(
a
) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
Définition de « réfugié »
96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays don't elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
Personne à protéger
97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays don't elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
Personne à protéger
(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
VII.
Standard of review
[18]
A decision relating to credibility should be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness. As a trial court, the RPD is the best placed to assess the credibility of an applicant (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA)).
[19]
When the standard of reasonableness applies, the Court may only intervene if the RPD's reasons are not "justified, transparent or intelligible". To satisfy this standard, the decision must also fall within the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47).
VIII.
Position of the parties
[20]
The applicant alleges that the Board erred in its assessment of his credibility by neglecting to consider the documents on the record. The applicant also argued that the RPD did not assess and analyze his specific circumstances if he were to return to Afghanistan.
[21]
The respondent argued that the RPD's decision is detailed and clearly explains the reasons for which they did not believe the applicant's allegations. The respondent argued that the applicant did not show behaviour compatible with someone who fears for his life and that the RPD acted reasonably in finding that the applicant was not credible.
IX.
Analysis
[22]
The only issue is whether the RPD's finding is reasonable in relation to the applicant's fear of the government of Afghanistan because of his refugee claim. The applicant did not seem to dispute the RPD's other findings, specifically in relation to his fear of the Taliban.
[23]
It is well established that the RPD's findings affecting issues of credibility and the assessment of evidence are entitled to great deference (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
Therefore, the reasons given by the RPD must not be subjected to a [translation] "microscopic" examination by the Court. The RPD must also not obliged to refer to each piece of evidence before it that is contrary to the findings of fact and explain how it dealt with this evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 16).
[25]
In this case, the applicant alleges mainly that the RPD neglected to support its reasons with the evidence in the record. After reviewing the record, the Court cannot agree with this statement.
[26]
The RPD took into account all the evidence available to it and all the explanations provided by the applicant with respect to his identity; including the three newspaper articles to which the applicant refers in his memorandum. However, the RPD determined that the applicant's version of the facts lacked credibility and that the objective evidence submitted did not demonstrate connections between the applicant and Aimal Wafa.
[27]
Essentially, the applicant was not able to present persuasive evidence to the RPD that he is indeed Aimal Wafa. The connection between him and Mr. Wafa is too tenuous. While he had photographic evidence of a person called Aimal Wafa in the record, it was not clear. This shows a significant gap, a space without an answer. Thus, the RPD was not able to determine whether the person resembled the applicant sufficiently to make a link between the two. This assessment of the evidence was completely reasonable.
[28]
It was understandable that the applicant disagreed with the analysis conducted by the RPD. However, the Court cannot substitute its opinion to that of the RPD. The RPD had the benefit of seeing and hearing the applicant; thus, it is in the best position to assess the probative value of any evidence produced by the applicant (
Cepeda- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Insofar as its assessment is reasonable, the Court cannot intervene in the RPD's decision.
[29]
The RPD's decision, taken as a whole, falls within the range of possible acceptable outcomes of the evidence before the RPD. The Court did not note any reviewable error in the RPD's findings. The RPD's reasons are clear, detailed and weighed. In addition, the Court found that the RPD considered the applicant's specific circumstances if he were to return to Afghanistan. It is clear that the RPD assessed the applicant's particular situation relating to the fear of the government of Afghanistan.
[30]
Following the evidence in the record that the RPD had before it and on which it was not obliged to comment (
Cepeda- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), the Court also noted that there were key inconsistencies in the central elements in the applicant's story.
For example, the applicant's original PIF indicates that he had only been educated at home but his amended PIF and his testimony shows that he was educated at "King's Hall Public School" in Peshewar, Pakistan, from 1999-2003 and then at "Said Nour Mohammed Shah Mind" in Kabul, Afghanistan, from 2003-2009
. The Court finds it difficult to see how the applicant could have forgotten to leave the country during his years of education. His friendships are also specified based on the story of the fear he alleged against the government of Afghanistan.
[31]
The applicant was thus not in Logar when some members of his family were allegedly killed or in Kabul when, according to one of the versions, he was followed by unknown persons in 2002, because he was in Pakistan until 2003.
These facts show that a part of an experience in the applicant's stated story or his second PIF has no inherent logic. This means that it was a very different path than what was given in the applicant's second account. Given the numerous significant discrepancies in the evidence in his record, the applicant does not seem to be able to provide a consistent account of his past experiences, even under name of Shahid Ahmadzai.
[32]
Significant gaps in the core of the applicant's story as a result of the two contradictory versions in addition to the false names in the record gives weight to courts other than the RPD. The Court entirely agrees with the RPD's non-credibility findings.
X.
Conclusion
[33]
For all the foregoing reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[34]
THE COURT ORDERS the dismissal of the applicant's application for judicial review; there is no question of general importance to certify.

Shahid Ahmadzai (partie demanderesse) v. Le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration (partie défenderesse)
I.
Au préalable
[1]
Le juge Shore
: La Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [Commission] a conclu, avec raison, suite à une analyse approfondie que ce cas du demandeur Afghan est un cas de manque de crédibilité avec des ambiguïtés, contradictions et incohérences provocantes donnant lieu aux espaces vides.
II.
Introduction
[2]
Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire d'une décision rendue le 7 janvier 2013 par la SPR, dans laquelle la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'était ni réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger au sens de l'article 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [
LIPR
].
III.
Faits
[3]
Le demandeur, monsieur Shahid Ahmadzai, est citoyen de l'Afghanistan, né à Logar, en 1988.
[4]
Le demandeur indique qu'à l'âge de 13 ans (en septembre 2002), son père et son frère auraient été tués par des assassins inconnus à Logar et que le demandeur serait allé vivre chez son oncle à Kabul avec sa mère et son frère peu après l'incident.
[5]
Le demandeur explique qu'en 2002 et 2003, des personnes inconnues l'auraient suivi à deux reprises à Kabul. Il croit que ces inconnus sont les mêmes personnes qui auraient tué certains membres de sa famille. Il indique que ces derniers cognaient aussi souvent à sa porte et lançaient des roches à ses fenêtres pendant la nuit.
[6]
Le demandeur indique qu'il est arrivé au Canada le 21 septembre 2009 et a présenté sa demande d'asile le 23 septembre 2009. Comme le demandeur n'avait aucun document d'identité en sa possession lors de sa demande, l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada [ASFC] l'a mis immédiatement en détention.
[7]
Le 27 octobre 2009, après trois contrôles des motifs de sa détention, le demandeur a témoigné devant la Section de l'immigration [SI] de la Commission que son véritable nom était « Aimal Wafa ». Le demandeur a témoigné qu'il avait changé son nom à cause de sa crainte des assassins ciblant des membres de sa famille afin de pouvoir jouer pour l'équipe nationale de cricket de l'Afghanistan. (Cet aveu est survenu seulement après qu'un agent de l'ASFC lui a demandé s'il était un des membres de l'équipe de cricket qui avait récemment fui l'Afghanistan et avait demandé l'asile au Canada.) Le demandeur a également témoigné qu'il avait menti à l'égard de son âge et son itinéraire (voir Procès-verbal de l'audience du 27 octobre 2009).
[8]
Le 10 novembre 2009, le demandeur a été relâché par l'ASFC car l'agence fut satisfaite de son identité.
[9]
Le 7 janvier 2013, la SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur.
IV.
Décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle judiciaire
[10]
Dans sa décision, la SPR a déterminé que la version des faits de monsieur Ahmadzai n'était pas crédible.
[11]
La SPR a conclu qu'il y avait plusieurs incohérences dans son histoire pour lesquelles aucune explication satisfaisante n'avait été fournie. La SPR a estimé que les éléments suivants minaient la crédibilité du demandeur en ce qui avait trait à sa crainte face aux assassins des membres de sa famille:
a) Premièrement, le demandeur ne pouvait pas expliquer de façon du tout satisfaisante pourquoi il avait indiqué dans sa déclaration au point d'entrée qu'il craignait être tué par les talibans, après avoir indiqué qu'il craignait des personnes « inconnues » dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) et son témoignage. Le demandeur ne pouvait pas non plus expliquer pourquoi il était le seul membre de sa famille vivant à être visé par ces personnes inconnues. De plus, il n'a fourni aucune preuve pour confirmer que son père et son frère avaient en fait été tués;
b) Deuxièmement, le demandeur n'avait pas indiqué dans son FRP original ou son FRP modifié qu'il avait porté plainte à la police de Kabul après avoir été suivi par des inconnus. Au contraire, dans son FRP original, il a indiqué qu'il n'était pas allé à la police puisqu'ils étaient tous liés aux talibans. Dans son FRP modifié, le demandeur n'a rien mentionné à l'égard de sa plainte. Le demandeur a seulement déclaré avoir porté plainte à la police lorsqu'il a déposé ses preuves documentaires pour l'audience du 7 janvier 2013.
[12]
En ce qui a trait à la crainte du demandeur envers le gouvernement de l'Afghanistan en raison de sa demande d'asile au Canada, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur était également non crédible.
[13]
Premièrement, la SPR a déterminé que l'allégation du demandeur qu'il devait changer son nom à Aimal Wafa en 2005 parce qu'il aurait eu peur d'être découvert par les talibans était invraisemblable, car aucun autre membre de sa famille vivant en Afghanistan n'avait été importuné par ces personnes inconnues et avait voulu changer de nom. Étant donné ses préoccupations relatives à la crédibilité du demandeur, la SPR a accordé peu de poids à son explication liée à son changement de nom.
[14]
Pareillement, la SPR a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucun lien entre le demandeur et Aimal Wafa; le demandeur n'avait présenté aucune preuve crédible qu'il était Aimal Wafa. La SPR a noté que la seule similarité entre le demandeur et Aimal Wafa était que les deux étaient joueurs de cricket qui sont arrivés au Canada vers la même date.
[15]
La SPR a ajouté que, même si elle avait cru que le demandeur était en fait Aimal Wafa, il n'y avait aucune preuve au dossier qui démontrait un risque objectivement fondé que le demandeur soit persécuté par le gouvernement de l'Afghanistan. La SPR a conclu qu'il était invraisemblable que le demandeur soit persécuté par ce gouvernement pour avoir déserté son équipe sportive en demandant l'asile au Canada.
V.
Point en litige
[16]
L'analyse de la crédibilité faite par la SPR était-elle raisonnable?
VI.
Dispositions législatives pertinentes
[17]
Les articles 96 et 97 de la
LIPR
s'appliquent en l'espèce:

(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
VII.
Norme de contrôle
[18]
Une décision portant sur la crédibilité devrait être révisée par la norme de la décision raisonnable. En tant que tribunal de première instance, la SPR est la mieux placée pour évaluer la crédibilité d'un demandeur (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF)).
[19]
Selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour ne peut intervenir que si les motifs de la SPR ne sont pas « justifiés, transparents ou intelligibles ». Pour satisfaire à cette norme, la décision doit également appartenir « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para 47).
VIII.
Position des parties
[20]
Le demandeur allègue que la Commission a commis une erreur dans son évaluation de sa crédibilité en omettant de considérer les documents au dossier. Le demandeur fait également valoir que la SPR n'a pas examiné et analysé ses circonstances particulières advenant son retour en Afghanistan.
[21]
Le défendeur soutient que la décision de la SPR est détaillée et explique clairement les raisons pour lesquelles elle ne croyait pas les allégations du demandeur. Le défendeur souligne que le demandeur n'affichait pas un comportement compatible avec celui qui craint pour sa vie, et que la SPR a agi raisonnablement en concluant que le demandeur n'était pas crédible.
IX.
Analyse
[22]
La seule question en litige est de savoir si les conclusions de la SPR sont raisonnables par rapport à la crainte du demandeur envers le gouvernement de l'Afghanistan en raison de sa demande d'asile. Le demandeur ne semble pas contester les autres conclusions de la SPR, notamment relatif à sa crainte des talibans.
[23]
Il est de jurisprudence constante que les conclusions de la SPR touchant à des questions de crédibilité et d'évaluation de la preuve bénéficient d'une grande déférence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
Les motifs donnés par la SPR ne doivent donc pas être examinés « à la loupe » par la Cour. Il ne faut pas non plus obliger la SPR à faire référence à chaque élément de preuve dont elle est saisie et qui est contraire à ses conclusions de fait, et à expliquer comment elle a traité ces éléments de preuve (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para 16).
[25]
En l'espèce, le demandeur allègue principalement que la SPR a omis d'appuyer ses motifs par la preuve au dossier. Après avoir examiné le dossier, la Cour ne peut pas être d'accord avec cette affirmation.
[26]
La SPR a tenu compte de tous les éléments de preuve à sa disposition et de toutes les explications fournies par le demandeur à l'égard de son identité; incluant les trois articles de journaux auxquels le demandeur fait référence dans son mémoire. La SPR a toutefois déterminé que la version des faits du demandeur manquait de crédibilité et que la preuve objective soumise ne démontrait pas de liens entre le demandeur et Aimal Wafa.
[27]
Essentiellement, le demandeur n'a pas été en mesure de présenter d'éléments de preuve convaincants à la SPR qu'il est en fait Aimal Wafa. Le lien entre lui et ce dernier est trop ténu. Bien qu'il avait une preuve photographique d'une personne dénommée Aimal Wafa au dossier, elle n'était pas claire. Cela démontre un vide important; donc avec un espace sans réponse. La SPR n'était donc pas en mesure de déterminer si la personne ressemblait suffisamment le demandeur pour faire un lien entre les deux. Cette appréciation de la preuve est tout à fait raisonnable.
[28]
Il est compréhensible que le demandeur soit en désaccord avec l'analyse effectuée par la SPR. Cependant, la Cour ne peut pas substituer son opinion à celle de la SPR. La SPR a eu l'avantage de voir et d'entendre le demandeur; elle est donc la mieux placée pour évaluer la valeur probante de tout élément de preuve produit par le demandeur (
Cepeda-Gutierrez
, ci-dessus). Dans la mesure où son appréciation est raisonnable, la Cour ne peut pas intervenir dans la décision de la SPR.
[29]
La décision de la SPR, prise dans son ensemble, appartient aux issues possibles acceptables eu égard à la preuve dont la SPR était saisie. La Cour ne constate aucune erreur susceptible de contrôle dans les conclusions de la SPR. Les motifs de la SPR sont clairs, détaillés et pondérés. De plus, la Cour estime que la SPR a pris en considération les circonstances particulières du demandeur advenant son retour en Afghanistan. Il ressort clairement que la SPR a examiné la situation particulière du demandeur par rapport à sa crainte du gouvernement de l'Afghanistan.
[30]
Suite à la preuve au dossier que la SPR avait devant elle, et sur laquelle elle n'était pas obligée de faire un commentaire (
Cepeda-Gutierrez
, ci-dessus;
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), la Cour constate également qu'il y a des incohérences clés dans les éléments centraux du récit du demandeur.
Par exemple, le FRP original du demandeur indique qu'il a seulement été scolarisé à la maison, mais son FRP modifié et son témoignage indique qu'il a été instruit à « King's Hall Public School » à Peshewar au Pakistan de 1999-2003 et ensuite à « Said Nour Mohammed Shah Mind » à Kabul en Afghanistan de 2003-2009
. La Cour voit difficilement comment le demandeur aurait pu oublier avoir quitté le pays pendant ses années de formation. Ses liens amicaux sont également spécifiés selon le récit à l'égard de la crainte qu'il allègue envers le gouvernement de l'Afghanistan.
[31]
Le demandeur n'aurait donc pas été présent à Logar lorsque certains membres de sa famille auraient été tués ou à Kabul lorsqu'il aurait, selon une des versions, été suivi par des personnes inconnues en 2002, car il était au Pakistan jusqu'en 2003.
Ces faits démontrent une phase d'un vécu qui n'a aucune logique inhérente à l'égard du récit prononcé par le demandeur, ni dans son deuxième FRP. Ceci signifie un trajet très différent qu'a raconté le demandeur la deuxième fois. Compte tenu de nombreuses divergences significatives dans la preuve au dossier du demandeur, le demandeur ne semble pas pouvoir donner un récit cohérent de ses expériences passées, même sous le nom de Shahid Ahmadzai.
[32]
Des trous d'importance centrale dans le nœud même du récit du demandeur suite aux deux versions contradictoires en plus d'un faux nom au dossier donnent matière aux instances autres que la SPR. La Cour est entièrement d'accord avec la conclusion de non-crédibilité de la SPR.
X.
Conclusion
[33]
Pour toutes les raisons ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur est rejetée.
JUGEMENT
[34]
LA COUR ORDONNE le rejet de la demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur sans question d'importance générale à certifier.
