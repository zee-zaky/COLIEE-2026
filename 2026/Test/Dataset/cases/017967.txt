Denault, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board rendered June 2, 1992, which found the applicant not to be a Convention refugee. The applicant seeks an order setting aside the decision and referring the matter back to a differently constituted panel, or a declaration that the applicant is a Convention refugee.
[2]
The applicant is a stateless person born in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. His former habitual residence was Gaza and he holds an UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) document recognizing him as a refugee. In 1980, he was arrested a number of times and mistreated because of an alleged connection with the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization). He came to Canada in 1982 as a student. He returned to Gaza in 1986 for a period of ten months. In 1987, he returned to Canada and claimed refugee status in September 1990, following a rejection of his application for permanent residence.
[3]
The tribunal found the applicant to be credible but concluded that the evidence did not reveal a reasonable chance of persecution should he return to Gaza. They based this determination upon the following reasons: there was no evidence that he was persecuted during the two years following the incidents in 1980 nor when he returned in 1986, his failure to claim refugee status immediately upon arrival in 1982 and 1987 indicated that he did not fear the Israeli authorities, he was able to leave Gaza legally, he had not engaged in any anti-Israeli activities since his arrival in Canada, his parents and his siblings lived in Gaza with no serious problems, serious efforts were being made to reconcile the Palestinians and the Israelis, and his motivation to claim refugee status was "for other purposes".
[4]
Counsel for the applicant and the respondent raised a number of issues before me. Two of these questions merit particular attention and are sufficient to dispose of this application, notwithstanding the existence of other possible errors in the decision.
[5]
The first error is the tribunal's failure to specifically consider the existence of the UNRWA document. While the tribunal need not mention all of the documentary evidence submitted, it is my opinion that it should consider material evidence or evidence which specifically relates to the applicant's particular claim, especially when the document mentions the applicant by name and it recognizes him as a refugee. In addition, according to the
Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status
(Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 1989) previous recognition as a refugee by the UNRWA is relevant to a person's status under the Convention:
"143. With regard to refugees from Palestine, it will be noted that UNRWA operates only in certain areas of the Middle East, and it is only there that its protection or assistance are given. Thus, a refugee from Palestine who finds himself outside that area does not enjoy the assistance mentioned and may be considered for determination of his refugee status under the criteria of the 1951 Convention. It should be normally sufficient to establish that the circumstances which originally made him qualify for protection or assistance from UNRWA still persist and that he has neither ceased to be a refugee under one of the cessation clauses nor is excluded from the application of the Convention under one of the exclusion clauses."
The Supreme Court of Canada commented on the persuasiveness of this document in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 713-714  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
"While not formally binding on signatory states, the Handbook has been endorsed by the states which are members of the Executive Committee of the UNHCR, including Canada, and has been relied on by the courts of signatory states."
This being the case, the fact of previous recognition which made the applicant qualify for protection from the UNRWA is cogent, though admittedly not determinative, and should have been addressed in the Board's decision.
[6]
The second error in the tribunal's decision occurs in its consideration of the changing circumstances surrounding the applicant's situation attributable to the negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. On this issue, the tribunal noted that
"In the past several months, some serious efforts have been made in order to reconcile the Palestinians with the Israelis and representatives of the parties have sat in a number of conferences trying to find some ways to solve the existing differences and achieve a permanent peace."
This finding is problematic for a number of reasons. The issue of change in circumstances is raised in the tribunal's decision without any mention of it made or notice given during the hearing. In my view, this constitutes a reviewable error.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), Linden, J.A., considered the requirement to provide notice in the context of a finding of an internal flight alternative and made the following comments, which I believe apply to a consideration of change in circumstances:
"A refugee claimant enjoys the benefit of the principles of natural justice in hearings before the Refugee Division. A basic and well-established component of the right to be heard includes notice of the case to be met (see, for example,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 1114). The purpose of notice is, in turn, to allow a person to prepare an adequate response to that case. This right to notice of the case against the claimant is acutely important where the claimant may be called upon to provide evidence to show that no valid IFA exists in response to an allegation by the Minister."
This principle is particularly applicable in instances such as this where the tribunal has made its finding of change in circumstances on the basis of information which appears to be the subject of judicial notice. There was no evidence of the peace negotiations in the documentary evidence before the tribunal and so it must be assumed that the tribunal took judicial notice of these facts. However, not only was there a duty to provide notice that change in circumstances was an issue the tribunal might consider, there was also a statutory duty to provide notice pursuant to s. 68(5) of the
Immigration Act
that the tribunal was taking judicial notice of the peace negotiations. In my opinion, these facts were not sufficiently "common knowledge" to be properly subject to judicial notice within the meaning of s. 68(3).

On the basis of the above, the application is allowed, the CRDD decision is set aside and the matter is referred back to the CRDD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.
Application allowed.
