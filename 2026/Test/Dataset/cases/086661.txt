Dubé, J.
: Two judicial review applications arising from the same factual circumstances and involving a common question of law have been joined by order of the court and heard together. The applicant, Apotex Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), seeks an order directing the respondent, the Minister of National Health and Welfare (the "Minister") to issue a notice of compliance ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) in respect of each dosage of its drug product, Apo-Enalapril. The respondents, Merck & Co. Inc. and Merck Frosst Canada Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), seek an order prohibiting the Minister from issuing a NOC to Apotex. These reasons will apply to both applications.
1. The Facts
[2]
Apotex is a Canadian company carrying on business as a manufacturer and distributor of generic pharmaceutical products. Merck is the owner and exclusive licensee of the drug enalapril under a patent valid until the year 2007, which prohibits the unauthorized importation, manufacture, use or sale of the drug in Canada. Merck markets enalapril under the trademark "Vasotec". The drug is used to reduce hypertension and in the treatment of congestive heart failure. According to the affidavit of André Marcheterre, Merck Vice President, enalapril is the company's most important pharmaceutical product, and the "number one single selling pharmaceutical brand in the Canadian pharmaceutical market in dollar terms" (Merck's Motion Record, vol. 1, Tab 2).
[3]
Provisions of the
Food and Drugs Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27, as amended, and the
Regulations
made pursuant thereto govern the process by which new drugs are approved for sale and advertising in Canada. Before selling or advertising for sale a "new drug", as that term is defined in s. C.08.001 of Division 8 of the
Food and Drugs Regulations
("
FDR
") (C.R.C. 1978, c. 870, as amended), a pharmaceutical manufacturer must obtain a NOC from the Minister. This is done by submitting to the Minister a new drug submission ("NDS") in accordance with the requirements set out in Division 8 of the
FDR
, which submission is then received by a particular division of the Health Protection Branch of the Department of National Health and Welfare (the "HPB").
[4]
A NDS consists of two components: a clinical or safety and efficacy portion, which includes the product monograph, and the chemistry and manufacturing portion. If the NDS is found to be satisfactory, that is if it complies with the requirements of the
FDR
, the Minister issues a NOC. The relevant provisions of Division 8 of the
FDR
are ss. C.08.001(a), C.08.002(1)(a) and (b), C.08.002(2) and C.08.004(1)(a), which read as follows:
"C.08.001 For the purposes of the Act and this Division 'New Drug' means
(a) a drug that contains or consists of a substance, whether as an active or inactive ingredient, carrier, coating, excipient, menstrum or other component, that has not been sold as a drug in Canada for sufficient time and in sufficient quantity to establish in Canada the safety and effectiveness of that substance for use as a drug;
. . . . .
"C.08.002(1) No person shall sell or advertise for sale a new drug unless
(a) the manufacturer of the new drug has filed with the Minister, in duplicate, a new drug submission relating to that new drug, having a content satisfactory to the Minister;
(b) the Minister has issued a notice of compliance to the manufacturer of the new drug in respect of that new drug submission pursuant to s. C.08.004;
. . . . .
"C.08.002(2) A new drug submission shall include such information as the Director [i.e., the Assistant Deputy Minister, HPB], may require and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing shall include
(a) a description of the new drug and a statement of its proper name, if any;
(b) a statement of the name under which it is proposed that the new drug will be sold;
(c) a list of all the ingredients of the new drug stated quantitatively, the specifications for the ingredients and, when the Director so requires, the names and addresses of the manufacturers of all the ingredients;
(d) a description of the plant and equipment to be used in manufacturing, processing and packaging of the new drug;
(e) details of the method of manufacture and the controls to be used in manufacturing, processing and packaging of the new drug;
(f) details of the tests to be applied to control the potency, purity, stability and safety of the new drug;
(g) detailed reports of the tests made to establish the safety of the new drug for the purposes and under the conditions of use recommended;
(h) substantial evidence of the clinical effectiveness of the new drug for the purpose and under the conditions of use recommended;
(i) a statement of the names and qualifications of all the investigators to whom the new drug has been sold;
(j) a draft of every label to be used in conjunction with the new drug;
(k) a statement of all the representations to be made for the promotion of the new drug;
(l) a description of the pharmaceutical form in which it is proposed that the new drug will be sold;
(m) samples of the drug in the finished pharmaceutical form in which it is proposed that the new drug be sold; and
(n) such samples of the components of the drug as the Director may require.
. . . . .
"C.08.004(1) The Minister
shall
, after completing an examination of a new drug submission or supplement thereto,
(a) if that submission of supplement complies with the requirements of s. C.08.002 or C.08.003, as the case may be, and s. C.08.005.1, issue a notice of compliance; or ..." (My emphasis)
[5]
In July 1989, the authority to issue NOC's was delegated by the then Minister to both the Assistant Deputy Minister of the HPB and to the Director General of the Drugs Directorate. However, as of January 1, 1993, because the position of Director General was vacant, the issuing authority was being exercised solely by Mr. Kent Foster ("Mr. Foster") in his capacity as Assistant Deputy Minister.
[6]
Apotex applied for a NOC in respect of Apo-Enalapril in February 1990. On September 29, 1991, Merck commenced an action against Apotex for alleged infringement of the enalapril patent; Apotex is defending this action. On December 22, 1992, Apotex launched the instant application seeking, inter alia, to compel the Minister to issue a NOC for Apo-Enalapril and several other drugs.
[7]
On February 3, 1993, officials in the Department of National Health and Welfare completed their review of the Apotex NDS for Apo-Enalapril.
NDS
are reviewed by HPB in two parts, the bio-equivalence or clinical portion, and the chemistry and manufacturing portion. The first review of the Apotex NDS was completed on January 27, 1993: the component was found to be satisfactory and in compliance with the
FDR
, and was recommended for the issuance of a NOC, provided that the second portion review also proved to be satisfactory. The latter, completed on February 2 or 3, 1993, was also found to be satisfactory and was recommended for issuance of a NOC.
[8]
On February 4, 1993, the documentation was given for signature to Mr. Foster. Accompanying the NOC documentation, and in keeping with standard practice, was a prepared courier form addressed to Apotex for use in transmitting the NOC's and Identification Forms without delay.
[9]
According to Bernard Sherman, the President of Apotex, the delay factor is important to generic drug manufacturers since, in most provinces, drugs may not be marketed as interchangeable with original or other generic products unless they are designated as such in provincial Drug Formularies. Eligibility for listing in these Formularies requires the manufacturer to hold a NOC. Delay in the NOC application process can result in a manufacturer being unable to meet a provincial Drug Formulary submission deadline, which results in a six month delay in marketing (Applicant's Record, vol. 1, Tab 2).
[10]
On February 4, 1993, the very day Mr. Foster received the NOC for signature, the
Patent Act Amendment Act, 1992
, S.C. 1993, c. 2 (the "
Act
"), formerly Bill C-91, received Royal Assent. Most of its statutory provisions were proclaimed in force on February 15, 1993 (SI/TR/93-26). However, the most important s. 55.2 of the
Act
, which provides for the regulation-making authority, and regulations thereunder were proclaimed only as of March 12, 1993 (SI/TR/93-41). The
Patented Medicine (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
(the "
Regulations
") have radically altered the procedures for obtaining a NOC, essentially prohibiting the Minister from granting a NOC for a patented drug until the expiry of all relevant product and use patents pertaining to that drug.
[11]
In his affidavit, Mr. Foster admitted that the Apo-Enalapril NDS had "cleared the scientific and regulatory review process" and that it had been "placed on my desk for signature" (Motion Record of the Attorney General of Canada and the Minister, Tab 5). On cross-examination, he also stated that both he and the Assistant Deputy Minister of National Pharmaceutical Strategy, Mr. Dan Michols, were of the view that a NOC ought to issue to the Apo-Enalapril NDS, or to any NDS caught in the transition period before the coming into effect of the
Act
and its
Regulations
. According to Mr. Foster, there was no need for a special policy to deal with such NDS, as "there is a law that is either applied at the time or there isn't. Either the law is in effect or it isn't" (Applicant's Record, vol. II, Tab 13, at pp. 277-279).
[12]
However, on January 31, 1993, and again on January 29 the Minister had notified Mr. Foster that he wished to be kept informed of any submissions for NOC's that might be affected by the changes to be brought about by the
Act
, including any with patent linkage.
[13]
On February 5, 1993, Mr. Foster contacted his Deputy Minister to inform him of the completed Apotex NOC application, as instructed. They concluded they ought to get legal advice as to how to proceed. Subsequently, the Minister himself requested "definitive" legal opinions, both internal and external. On February 24, Mr. Foster sought further legal advice as to whether he could issue a NOC. These opinions are protected by the rules of confidentiality and have not been filed in court.
[14]
The Minister also received numerous "unsolicited legal opinions" which had been obtained by Merck and which were filed in court. The opinions filed by Merck were to the effect that the Minister ought not to issue the NOC to Apotex.
[15]
On February 22, 1993, Merck filed its application for prohibition. On March 4, Apotex applied by motion for an order directing that a NOC be issued for Apo-Enalapril. The motion was adjourned at the Minister's behest. On March 18, the Apotex and Merck applications were consolidated by order of McGillis, J. (On March 24, McGillis, J., also ordered that the remainder of the Apotex judicial review application concerning the other Apotex NDS mentioned therein be adjourned sine die.)
[16]
There is no evidence as to when exactly the NOC in question was presented to the Minister for his consideration. To this date, neither the Minister nor Mr. Foster has signed the NOC.
2. The Applicant's Position
[17]
Apotex' position is that as of February 3, 1993, the date when the Apo-Enalapril NDS had been found to be in compliance with all existing regulatory requirements, neither s. 55.2 of the
Act
nor the
Regulations
thereunder were in force. Consequently, there was no discretion left to the Minister but to issue the NOC as per the law in effect. At that point, the statutory power and discretion vested in the Minister had crystallized into the duty, set out in s. C.08.004(1)(a) of the
FDR
, to issue the NOC.
[18]
The Minister had no discretion to refuse to perform this duty. Signing and issuing a notice pursuant to a statutory duty is a purely ministerial act, once the statutory requirements are satisfied. And a statutory duty unaccompanied by any discretion requires action to be taken in a prescribed manner and form when conditions precedent are in place as in the instant case. Such a mere ministerial act may be enforced by mandamus. (See
Re Massey Manufacturing Co.
(1886), 11 O.R. 444, at pp. 457, 462-464 (C.P.), affd. 13 O.A.R. 446 (C.A.), and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 450 (Ont. C.A.).)
[19]
Apotex also submits, as a corollary to the foregoing proposition, that upon completion of the review of a NDS and a finding that the preconditions for the issuance of a NOC under the
FDR
have been met, the submitting manufacturer obtains a vested right to the NOC, which right generates the ability to enforce the correlative duty. So as to establish a vested right, a person must demonstrate, first, that there is a tangible or particular legal right, not one that is abstract or a mere expectation, and secondly, that the right was exercised or solidified sufficiently to justify its protection. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 555-557 W.W.R. (C.A.) As of February 3, 1993, once the Apo-Enalapril NDS had complied with the existing regulatory requirements, Apotex had acquired a legal right to obtain a NOC co-relative to the Minister's obligation to issue it.
[20]
Moreover, the Minister's statutory power must be exercised upon relevant considerations and within the purview of the scope, objects and policy of the conferring enactment. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  achieving a collateral object. Here, the discretion of the Minister was limited to matters of efficacy and safety of the drug, i.e., to determining whether the NDS met the requirements of the
FDR
. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 206, at p. 209, 219-220 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 440 (F.C.A.).) He was not entitled to consider proposed changes to patent legislation, in an area under the authority of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. The Minister was not entitled to withhold the issuance of the Ano-Enalapril NOC until the
Act
and the
Regulations
were proclaimed, so that the Apotex submission would fall under the new NOC regime to be applied to generic drugs manufacturers.
[21]
In other words, since, as of February 3, 1993, the Minister had exhausted the discretion vested in him by the
Food and Drugs Act
and the
FDR
, he had no power to consider matters outside his purview. More specifically, he was without authority to take into account the prospect that amendments to the patent statute would become law at some future date, or that new
Regulations
would be promulgated which would affect the issuance of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 618-619 O.R. (Div. Ct.).)
[22]
Since the rights of Apotex had crystallized on February 3, 1993, the Minister was also precluded from using undue administrative delay for the sole purpose of defeating those rights. Clearly, some administrative delay may be reasonable, but the reasonable delay argument cannot be used for the obvious purpose of defeating an application. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 473 (Dist. Ct.).) In the instant case, it appears that the Minister delayed to seek legal advice as to how to treat NOC submissions in the transitional period. However, as of today's date, the Minister has yet to sign the NOC, or even to advise Apotex as to why he has not.
[23]
Furthermore, there is a presumption that vested rights are not affected by legislative enactment unless the intention of the legislator to do so is clear. This presumption applies whether or not the legislation is retrospective or prospective in operation. (See
Scott
, supra, at pp. 554-555, quoting from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 7 N.R. 401.) In the absence of a clear indication of a contrary intention, the substantive rights of parties to an action are determined by the law as it existed when the action was commenced, whether or not the law has changed before the hearing of the case or pending appeal. (See
Halbury's Laws of England
(4th Ed.), vol. 44, p. 571, para. 922.) The application of Apotex for a mandamus goes back to December 22, 1992, whereas s. 55.2 of the
Act
and the
Regulations
thereunder only became effective on March 12, 1993.
[24]
Apotex also argues that where an
Act
or
Regulations
or any portion thereof are repealed, the repeal does not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accruing or incurred under the enactment so repealed, by virtue of s. 43 of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, as amended. The purpose of that saving provision has been characterized in the
Scott
case, supra, as lying "in fairness". (See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 205, reversed by a majority decision of the Federal Court of Appeal on July 7, 1993.)
[25]
Finally, the Minister must not act in a manner which is unfair, unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. The general duty of fairness includes a duty to act in a consistent and nondiscriminatory manner. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at pp. 186, 191-192, 195 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 140 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 182-183 (H.C.).) Treating applicants differently, even where there is no bad faith or deliberate discrimination, is unlawful discrimination and a breach of fairness. (See
Noel
, ibid., at p. 322.) There is evidence that after February 4, 1993, the Minister continued to issue NOC's in respect of drug products for which there were patents extant, to both Apotex and other parties, thus leading to the conclusion that the Minister acted inconsistently and discriminated against Apotex in respect of its drug Apo-Enalapril.
3. Merck's Submission
[26]
Faced with Apotex' compelling submission, counsel for Merck advanced his own battery of impressive arguments, which I will attempt to abridge as follows.
[27]
On January 5, 1993, Apotex attempted unsuccessfully to cause the Federal Court of Canada to enjoin Parliament from enacting Bill C-91. That Bill constituted a major plank in the government program to transform the former regime of compulsory licensing into a new regime providing for full patent protection to pharmaceutical companies engaged in the research, development and marketing of pharmaceutical products. After the passage of the Bill and Royal Proclamation, the applicant, a manufacturer of generic drugs, had no right to mandamus. Even before February 4, 1993, Bill C-91 was on the books and its general policy was well-known. Mandamus ought not to issue to thwart the will of Parliament.
[28]
Merck argued that under the
FDR
, it is the Minister and not his departmental officials who has the power to issue or to refuse to issue a NOC: "the Minister shall after completing an examination of a new drug submission ... issue a notice of compliance". The Minister is not merely a rubber stamp bound to endorse the recommendations of departmental officials.
[29]
Further, on January 21, 1993, the present Minister placed "a fetter" on the official exercising delegated authority in relation to any NOC application that had a patent linkage. Mr. Foster knew that he was obliged to inform the Minister of any such NOC application and that he was fettered in that regard.
[30]
In order to obtain a mandamus, Apotex bears the burden of establishing not only that the Minister had no discretion in the issuance of the NOC, but also that the ministerial power ripened into an obligation to in fact issue the NOC to Apotex no later than February 4, 1993, when Bill C-91 became law. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 5 F.T.R. 64 (T.D.).) Under the terms of s. C.08.002(1)(a) of the
FDR
, the drug submission by Apotex was required to have "a content satisfactory to the Minister". These are classic words conferring a discretion.
[31]
The word "shall" appearing in s. C.08.004(1)(a), and which is relied upon by Apotex, takes its colour from the context in which it is used. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 390, at pp. 396-398 (F.C.A.), and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 543, at pp. 549-552 (T.D.).) In the instant case, the discretion remained vested in the Minister, for it was he who must first decide that the submission was satisfactory.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  comments of MacGuigan, J.A., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  such a notice is discretionary. In exercising his discretion, the Minister weighs the benefit of the drug against the foreseeable risk of adverse reaction to it.
. . . . .
"The Minister's determination is one made in contemplation of public health and represents the implementation of social and economic policy."
[32]
Moreover, the Apotex application to compel an issuance of a NOC was premature when it was made on December 22, 1992, since at that time its submission in respect of Apo-Enalapril was incomplete. By the time the NOC application was recommended for approval by HPB officials, and received by a control clerk in Mr. Foster's office on February 4, 1993, Bill C-91 had become law.
[33]
Subsequently, up to and including March 12, 1993, the Minister and his staff were gathering advice regarding the legality of issuance of the NOC in the circumstances that confronted them. This cannot be construed as an inappropriate administrative delay. (See
Engineers' and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1980] 1 All E.R. 896 (H.L.).) After March 12, 1993, the Minister no longer had discretion to issue the NOC because of the prohibition contained in s. 7 of the
Regulations
. Section 7(1) reads, in part, as follows:
"7(1) The Minister shall not issue a notice of compliance to a second person before the latest of
(a) the expiration of 30 days after the coming into force of these Regulations,
(b) the day on which the second person complies with s. 5,
(c) ..."
[34]
Merck also argues that Apotex does not have a compulsory licence, no legal right in the face of Merck's patent to manufacture or sell enalapril in Canada. The new
Act
introduced in the House of Commons on June 23, 1992, repealed the compulsory licence provisions in their entirety. Its s. 12(1) also extinguished compulsory licences which were issued on or after December 20, 1991 as of the end of February 3, 1993. Since Apotex never obtained a compulsory licence for enalapril, it was not affected by this repeal.
[35]
At the same time, the
Act
and the
Regulations
thereunder expressly made the rights of patentees paramount over the interests of generic companies which were seeking, but which had not yet been issued NOC's. So as to reinforce that paramountcy, Parliament provided a special rule in s. 55.2(5), as follows:
"(5) In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between
(a) this section or any regulations made under this section, and
(b) any Act of Parliament or any regulations made thereunder, this section or the regulations made under this section shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency or conflict."
[36]
This rule gives the
Regulations
paramountcy over any alleged obligations of the Minister under the
Food and Drugs Act
and the
FDR
thereunder, as well as over the
Federal Court Act
itself.
[37]
Merck also submits that the Apotex application is defeated by the express terms of the
Regulations
, which became effective on March 12, 1993, and which apply explicitly to applications for NOC's already filed but not yet issued as of that date. Section 5(1) reads as follows:
"5(1) Where a person files or, before the coming into force of these Regulations, has filed a submission for a notice of compliance in respect of a drug and wishes to compare that drug with, or make a reference to, a drug that has been marketed in Canada pursuant to a notice of compliance issued to a first person in respect of which a patent list has been submitted, the person shall, in the submission, with respect to each patent on the patent list,
(a) state that the person accepts that the notice of compliance will not issue until the patent expires, or
(b) allege that
(i) the statement made by the first person pursuant to paragraph 4(2)(b) is false,
(ii) the patent has expired,
(iii) the patent is not valid,
(...) etc."
[38]
Section 5(2) of the
Regulations
is also specifically directed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applications "in the pipeline", i.e., filed but not yet issued as of March 12, 1993:
"5(2) Where, after a second person files a submission for a notice of compliance, but before the notice of compliance is issued, a patent list is submitted or amended in respect of a patent pursuant to subs. 4(5), the second person shall amend the submission to include, in respect of that patent, the statement or allegation that is required by subs. (1)."
[39]
Under the terms of s. 7(1), compliance with s. 5 is a condition precedent to the issuance of a NOC. (See also s. 4(4).)
[40]
Where enactments are clear and unambiguous, as in this case, there is no room to invoke rules of construction designed to assist in the interpretation of
ambiguous
enactments, such as the presumptions against retrospectivity or interference with vested or acquired rights. (See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at p. 282 and
Commission de protection du territoire agricole ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Q.A.C. 162, at p. 906.) Further, s. 10 of the
Interpretation Act
stipulates that every
Act
shall be deemed to be remedial and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the
Act
according to its true intent, meaning and spirit. The obvious "mischief" aimed at by the
Act
is the appropriation, by generic drug companies, of the benefit of patented medicines developed by innovator drug companies. Therefore, a proper interpretation of the
Act
favours the eradication of that mischief.
[41]
Under the former law, the courts constantly emphasized that it was the compulsory licence that affected the patent owners' rights, and that the NOC merely enabled the generic drug company to exercise its right under the compulsory licence. (See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.) As Apotex had no compulsory licence for the drug enalapril, it was quite correct for the Minister, realizing that the compulsory licensing regime had been swept away, to consider the NOC in light of the circumstances.
[42]
Moreover, the jurisdiction of this court to issue a mandamus herein was ousted by the enactments brought into effect on March 12, 1993. The
Regulations
on their face expressly apply to NOC applications pending before the Minister on March 12, 1993. As of that date a new procedure was in place which Apotex must follow. Sections 6 and 8 of the
Regulations
create new rights and remedies to regulate disputes between patent owners and other persons (such as generic drug companies) who seek NOC's in respect of patented drugs. These procedures govern NOC's applied for but not as yet issued, but have not been followed by Apotex. Since the
Federal Court Act
is subject to the paramountcy provision in s. 55.2(5) of the
Act
, granting judicial review to Apotex in the present proceedings would fly in the face of the special procedures and remedies provided by the new enactments.
[43]
Even if there is any ambiguity about the date of application of the new procedure, which is disputed, such ambiguity would be resolved against Apotex by the presumption that
procedural
enactments apply to pending proceedings and may be given retrospective effect. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at pp. 419-420.)
[44]
In any event, no retrospective application is contemplated in the present case. The relevant enactments apply to the Minister at the time of enactment and not before. At the time Apotex claims it had a "vested" right, the Minister had not even been presented with the file. As of March 12, 1993, the Minister had not issued the NOC in question and from that date onwards he must act under the new provisions. (See
Quebec (Procureur général)v. Office national de l'énergie
, [1991] 3 F.C. 443; 132 N.R. 214, at p. 454 (F.C.A.).)
[45]
It is of no importance whether the critical date be February 4, 1993, (when Bill C-91 became effective) or March 12, 1993, (when s. 55.2 of the
Act
and the
Regulations
became effective). On both dates the Apotex application was "in the pipeline" and whatever vested right in the NOC Apotex may have had was extinguished by the unambiguous terms of the new enactments.
[46]
Further, the "savings" provision of s. 43 of the
Interpretation Act
does not assist Apotex as it only applies to the repeal of an enactment. In the instant case, no relevant enactment was repealed. It is true that the compulsory licensing provisions of the
Patent Act
were repealed but Apotex held no right thereunder in respect of enalapril.
[47]
Moreover, even if the
Act
and
Regulations
are not clearly and unambiguously conclusive against the Apotex application, Apotex did not acquire a vested right to the issuance of a NOC to enalapril prior to February 4, 1993. NOC being a statutory creature, there is no proprietary right to it outside the framework of the legislation. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.).) By specifically addressing the issue of applications "in the pipeline", the
Regulations
implicitly extinguish all such applications not specifically saved. (See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.) Apotex seeks to create a "window of opportunity" for itself between the former statutory regime and the present one, as it intends to provide enalapril to provincial Formularies as soon as possible, notwithstanding the fact that the Merck patent in question does not expire until October 16, 2007. Obviously, Parliament did not intend to create a hiatus during which
neither
the old regime or the new one applied. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 361; 56 A.P.R. 361.)
[48]
Finally, the court ought not to issue a discretionary remedy such as mandamus that would frustrate the clearly expressed will of Parliament. Courts ought not to enforce an old regulatory regime when a new one is in place or clearly pending. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at pp. 86-87 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at pp. 221-222 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Apotex with respect to enalapril would merely facilitate patent infringement by Apotex of the Merck Patent. The courts have traditionally withheld mandamus where the effect of granting it would simply contribute to "confusion and disorder". (See S.A. de Smith,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action
(3rd Ed.), at p. 498.)
4. The Minister's Submission
[49]
Counsel for the Minister admits that Mr. Foster was advised by the Minister's Chief of Staff that in view of the impending passage of the
Act
, he should keep the Minister informed of any submissions for NOC's that might be affected by the
Act
, and more particularly of any NOC which might have a patent linkage. He also admits that by February 3, 1993, Apo-Enalapril had met all required scientific criteria and conditions under the existing
FDR
, and that all documents transmitted to Mr. Foster on February 4, 1993, were ready for signature. The next day, Mr. Foster and his Deputy Minister, concluded that they should seek a legal opinion. Also on February 5, 1993, Mr. Foster received a telephone call from the President of Merck describing the consequences to Merck should a NOC be issued to Apotex. Subsequently, both the Minister and Mr. Foster obtained additional legal advice, and Merck forwarded numerous legal opinions in support of its position to the Minister.
[50]
The Minister maintains that he and Mr. Foster were entitled to obtain and consider legal advice, and that they acted properly and in a timely fashion in doing so. On March 12, 1993, when the
Regulations
came into force, a NOC had not been issued to Apotex. Neither the Minister nor Mr. Foster had been required to issue a NOC prior to that date, and the right of Apotex to compel the Minister to issue the NOC as well as the right of Merck to restrain the Minister from doing so "must be determined in light of and in accordance with, the legislative scheme as it now exists".
[51]
According to the Minister, the NOC's issued after February 4, 1993, were related to patents no longer in existence or to compulsory licences granted prior to the new regime; whereas the Apotex application had patent linkage and no compulsory licence.
5. Analysis
[52]
After careful consideration of the foregoing arguments and authorities, I have concluded that resolution of the present applications hinges on a determination as to whether the Minister, prior to March 12, 1993, had the discretion under the
FDR
to decline to issue the Apotex NOC.
[53]
In my view, there can be no doubt that the
FDR
did entitle the Minister to exercise his discretion in the Apotex NDS approval process. However, this discretion, like all discretionary authority, was not unfettered. The scope of the Minister's discretion was limited strictly to a consideration of factors relevant to the purposes of the
FDR
as they relate to the process for approval of new drugs to be marketed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 39 F.T.R.) It was limited to a decision as to whether the HPB review of the Apotex NDS established that Apo-Enalapril was safe and effective. Once that question had been answered in the affirmative, as it was in this case, any other extraneous consideration was irrelevant to the issuance of a NOC under the
FDR
.
[54]
The Minister was not entitled to refuse to issue a NOC to Apotex on the basis of anticipated changes to the patent statute and regulations thereunder, an area within the authority of his colleague, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.
[55]
I am sustained in this conclusion by the relevant provisions of the
FDR
. Section C.08.001 states that for the purposes of the
Food and Drugs Act
and Division 8, the term "New Drug" means any drug that has not been sold "for sufficient time and in sufficient quantity to establish in Canada [its] safety and effectiveness". Section C.08.002(1) sets out the conditions which must be met before a new drug may be manufactured and sold: no drug may be sold unless a NDS has been submitted "having a content satisfactory to the Minister", a NOC has been issued in respect of that NDS and has not been suspended, and all printed material to be used in connection with the new drug has been submitted.
[56]
Section C.08.002(2) outlines a lengthy, nonexhaustive enumeration of the specific contents a NDS must provide for purposes of scientific evaluation. The
FDR
do not detail the technical aspects of the examination process itself, nor would they be expected to. As previously mentioned, the examination is comprised of two components, bio-equivalence or safety and efficacy, and chemistry and manufacturing. The process is a lengthy one. According to the affidavit evidence of HPB officials responsible for NDS review, generic NDS spend an average of 27 months "in the queue", and an average of approximately another month under active review. (Affidavit of Wayne Nitchuk, para. 22 and 29, Tab 1, Minister's Motion Record; see also affidavit of Sultan Ghani, Tab 3.)
[57]
Depending on the results of the review, s. C.08.004(1) then provides that the Minister
shall
, "after completing an examination" of a NDS, either issue a NOC if the NDS complies with the requirements of s. C.08.002, or notify the manufacturer that the NDS does not comply with the requirements.
[58]
In arriving at his decision, the Minister must weigh the benefit of a new drug against the risk associated with its use on the basis of public health considerations. (See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra [para. 20].) In so doing, he exercises considerable discretion in determining the standards a NDS will have to meet before its content will be considered "satisfactory" in terms of safety and effectiveness. As my colleague Mackay, J., has stated in a recent decision concerning the
FDR
(See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, [para. 53] at pp. 38-39):
"... [T]he words 'having a content satisfactory to the Minister' qualify the words 'new drug submission' so that in every case the content of a submission is a matter within the discretion of the Minister and those acting on his or her behalf to determine.
. . . . .
"... [T]he regulations vest complete and exclusive discretion in the respondent Minister and the Director of HPB to determine the requirements of a new drug submission
in terms of the information or evidence to be provided by the manufacturer
." (My emphasis)
[59]
The scheme of the
FDR
suggests that it is the examination by HPB officials of the various elements of a NDS that determines whether the requirements of s. C.08.002 are met, that is, whether the content of the NDS is satisfactory for the purpose of issuing a NOC. Logically, it is through this examination process that the risk-benefit weighing occurs, pursuant to policy decisions defining standards as to what will be considered "satisfactory" at the end of that process. On cross-examination, Mr. Foster stated that once NOC documentation reaches him, "I understand them, then, to have been completely reviewed from a scientific and safety point of view". He added that "at that point, I sign them, ... which approves the submission, the NOC". (Applicant's Record, vol. II, Tab 13, at p. 240.)
[60]
Thus, the entire NDS approval process is geared solely toward determining the safety and effectiveness of the drug under consideration. The suggestion that a NDS which has passed muster with HPB officials as being safe and effective may then be refused a NOC, on the basis that its content is still not satisfactory to the Minister on grounds other than safety and effectiveness, is not consistent with the scheme of the
FDR
, and in fact would defeat its purpose.
[61]
I conclude that the
FDR
do not contemplate or authorize the broad scope of ministerial discretion in the NDS approval process advanced by Merck. In the instant case, HPB officials had completed their examination of the Apo-Enalapril NDS. They had found it to be in compliance with safety and effectiveness standards. They recommended, on February 3, 1993, that a NOC be issued in respect of Apo-Enalapril. There were no outstanding safety and effectiveness concerns remaining to be dealt with. Hence, neither the Minister nor his delegate Mr. Foster had discretion under the
FDR
to refuse to issue a NOC to Apotex on other grounds. The Minister's discretion had been exhausted as of February 4, 1993, and he was thus bound to issue a NOC.
[62]
In my view, this interpretation of the
FDR
is consistent with views expressed in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> cases relied on by both parties, and cited above by Merck (supra, [para. 20]; see also <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, [para. 53], at pp. 38-40). In the former, I note that Rouleau, J., outlined the NOC process in the following terms ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, [para. 20], at p. 209):
"... In order to obtain a notice of compliance a company is required to submit to the branch [HPB] a new drug submission containing extensive material, including a product monograph, as set out in the regulations. The central purpose of the
Regulations
is to ensure that any new drug meets rigorous safety profile standards in order to protect the Canadian public. If,
upon review
, the Minister finds the new drug submission to be satisfactory,
he is compelled to issue a notice of compliance
..." (My emphasis)
[63]
My conclusion also finds sustenance in the reasons of Muldoon, J., in
Jamieson (C.E.) &  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), in which he stated at p. 204:
"... [W]hatever discretion is accorded by these clear and detailed
Regulations
is quite restricted ...
Under reg. C.08.004 the Minister is bound either to issue a notice of compliance or to notify the manufacturer why the submission ... does not comply
... The Minister is subject to the court's supervising power to order mandamus in that regard. ... These delegated powers do not permit the Minister or the Director to do as they please: they have no unfettered discretion." (My emphasis)
[64]
This finding does not however dispose entirely of the instant application. The
FDR
stipulate no time-frame for the actual issuance of a NOC following a positive HPB recommendation. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the Minister was bound to issue the Apotex NOC immediately upon receipt of the HPB recommendation or, in any event, before March 12, 1993.
[65]
The evidence of Mr. Foster concerning standard practice in such matters was that NOC documentation transmitted to him for signature, in finalization of the NOC issuance process, is routinely accompanied by a transmittal or courier slip. He stated that "the documents come prepared once they are signed because it's the last event in the sequence of an issuance. They come with the envelopes typed to the addresses. Obviously, the [courier] slip, in my opinion, is to ensure that there is a minimum of delay in getting them out once they are signed". (Applicant's Record, vol. II, Tab 13, at p. 242.)
[66]
Thus, the standard procedure was not followed in the instant case. As mentioned, both the Minister and Merck maintain that the former, and his delegate Mr. Foster, were entitled to seek legal advice and were under no obligation to issue the NOC under consideration prior to March 12, 1993.
[67]
In support of this position, Merck relies on a House of Lords decision (
Engineers' and Managers' Association
, supra, [para. 33]), in which a majority of the Upper Chamber determined that a labour relations tribunal had the power to suspend its process related to conflicting accreditation applications for over two years to await the outcome of indirectly related court proceedings. Such a delay was found not to be unreasonable. Both the context of that case and the facts giving rise to that decision are, however, clearly distinguishable from those under consideration here. Among other things, the statute conferred upon the labour relations tribunal a breadth of discretion not found in the
FDR
, and proceedings in that case were at a preliminary stage rather than at the final stage reached with the Apotex application.
[68]
As I see it, the Minister ought to have been concerned primarily with matters within his jurisdiction, rather than waiting for legal advice on extra-departmental matters, even those which might eventually impact upon his own administration. The legal advice justification was potentially endless: how much legal advice was required and for how long would it continue to be sought? This court is not privy to the legal opinions obtained by the Minister himself, as he would not disclose them, but he has yet either to issue the NOC or to inform Apotex that the Apo-Enalapril NDS does not comply with the requirements of the
FDR
.
[69]
Furthermore, the Minister had no assurance, either on February 4, 1993, when the
Act
was passed, or on February 15, when it was proclaimed, that the
Regulations
would be promulgated on March 12. Yet, it was only these
Regulations
that would have a direct effect on the NOC issuing procedure. In theory, the
Regulations
might not yet have come into effect, in which case, following the Minister's argument to its logical conclusion, he would still be entitled to seek legal advice as to their eventual impact, and still under no obligation to issue the NOC.
[70]
A final point on this matter is that Parliament could have provided explicitly, in the "Related Matters" sections of the
Act
, for the disposition of NOC applications completed during the transition period. The fact that it did not reinforces my view that the Apo-Enalapril NOC should have been dealt under the
FDR
, in keeping with existing practice.
[71]
In fact, from February 4 to March 12, 1993, the
FDR
were in place, the Apotex NOC was ready for signature; whereas s. 55.2 of the
Act
and the
Regulations
were not. I am in agreement with Mr. Foster's view that "either the law is in effect or it isn't", and find that the Minster's delay in issuing the Apotex NOC was not warranted.
[72]
But, Merck argues, mandamus ought not to issue to frustrate the will of Parliament when a new regulatory regime is clearly pending. A line of authorities represented by the
Boyd Builders
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada (supra [para. 48]), is relied on to support this proposition. These cases were all concerned with the prima facie common law rights of land owners with respect to building permits, and hence to mandamus to compel their issuance, vis-à-vis the rights of municipalities to make zoning bylaws negativing those prima facie rights. In that context, the operative principle, as articulated in the
Boyd Builders
decision (ibid., at p. 705) is that the prima facie right of a property owner
"... to utilize his own property in whatever manner he deems fit subject only to the rights of surrounding owners ... may be defeated or superseded by rezoning if three prerequisites are established by the municipality, (a) a clear intent to restrict or zone existing before the application by the owner for a building permit, (b) that council has proceeded in good faith, and (c) that council has proceeded with dispatch."
[73]
Where the municipality established these prerequisites, mandamus was not available to the land owner.
[74]
I do not believe the
Boyd Builders
line of cases can or should be applied to the present circumstances. In my opinion, principles developed in the specific context of conflict between municipal planning law and the common law of land ownership ought not to be transported facilely to an entirely unrelated legal context. We are dealing here not with the common law but with an area of highly regulated statute law. Furthermore, even in the limited context of the
Boyd Builders
cases, I note that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a more recent building case, the Ontario Divisional Court made these relevant observations (supra, [para. 21], at p. 619):
"Because of the mandatory duty imposed by s. 6(1) of the
Building Code Act
, there is no room now for application by the inspector or chief official of the
Boyd Builders
principles, ...
"... [T]he Legislature did away with the
Boyd Builders
principles by enacting s. 6(1) ..., which directs that a permit be issued except where the proposed building will not comply with the
Act
or the building code or will contravene any other applicable law. In respect of zoning, if the proposed construction complies with the zoning bylaws in force at the date of the application for the permit, then the intention of the municipality to rezone to prohibit such construction is not a valid reason for refusing or postponing the issuance of a permit."
[75]
Thus, even if municipal planning law principles might, in theory, be applicable to the instant case, the mandatory provision in s. C.08.004 of the
FDR
would preclude application of the
Boyd Builders
common law principles.
[76]
Finally, the instant case is distinguishable from all the building permit cases in that, unlike them, the instant case involves two distinct legislative areas, each governed by its own discrete body of statutory law. It only stands to reason that regulations dealing with national health and welfare concerns are not applicable to intellectual property matters.
[77]
In view of my conclusion that the Apotex NOC ought to have been signed in accordance with the
FDR
prior to the proclamation of the
Regulations
, it is unnecessary to address the remaining issues raised by the parties which relate directly or indirectly to the regime introduced by the
Regulations
. I am referring to arguments based on principles of vested rights, statutory repeal, retrospectivity and paramountcy.
[78]
Before closing, I take the opportunity to dispose of a "preliminary" matter raised by Merck, that Apotex' December 22, 1992, originating notice of motion was premature because, as of that date, the Apo-Enalapril NDS was incomplete. According to the terms of the notice of motion, Apotex sought an order directing the Minister to disclose the status of a number of NDS filed by Apotex, including that for Apo-Enalapril; to complete the reviews of these submissions, should they not have been completed; and to issue NOC's "if the results of the reviews are satisfactory". Thus Apotex was not requesting relief divorced from the normal requirements of the
FDR
, or "jumping the gun". And, as of February 3, 1993, long before this matter came on for hearing, the results of the Apo-Enalapril NDS had been recommended for issuance of a NOC. The argument based on prematurity must therefore fail.
[79]
Consequently, the application for mandamus is allowed. The application for prohibition is denied.
Mandamus application allowed;
prohibition application dismissed.
