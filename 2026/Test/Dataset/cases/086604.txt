INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c. 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated 21 July 2011 (Decision), which refused the Applicants' application to be deemed Convention refugees or a persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicants are citizens of Sri Lanka and are currently living in Markham, Ontario. They are both sixty years old and have a daughter (Subangini) and grandchildren living in Canada. The Secondary Applicant's brother and sister also live in Canada.
[3]
The Principal Applicant says that, when he lived in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan army and police would often visit his home. During the conflict between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government, LTTE members would also sometimes visit his home and demand money. On two separate occasions, he says he gave them 10,000 Rupees - approximately $80.
[4]
The Applicants' son, Pradeep, was kidnapped by unknown people in 2005 and has not been heard from since. After Pradeep was kidnapped, the Applicants sent their other son, Prasanna, to claim refugee status in the United Kingdom (UK). The record is unclear as to how authorities in the UK finally disposed of that claim. Subangini came to Canada in 2006 and claimed refugee status. The RPD rejected her claim; however, she was accepted as a refugee on 29 October 2010 during a PRRA application (see page 284 of the Certified Tribunal Record (CTR)).
[5]
The Principal Applicant says the Sri Lankan police and army once stopped him on a road near Trincomalee. They took money from his wallet and searched his other baggage. He also says he was once detained by members of the Karuna Faction - a paramilitary group associated with the Sri Lankan army - on 26 November 2009, after the government defeated the LTTE in 2009. On this occasion, two men with pistols took him from his home, blindfolded him, and drove him to a house some distance away. The men interrogated him about his sons and beat him with a stick and their bare hands. After holding him captive for two days, the men released him because the Secondary Applicant paid them a bribe.
[6]
The Applicants decided that they should leave Sri Lanka and made arrangements through an agent to do so. They sold their home to pay their way and set off for Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 5 January 2010.
[7]
When the Applicants were in Colombo, the police came to the place they were staying and questioned them. The Principal Applicant says the police asked him about his national identity card and told him to leave Colombo. The Applicants contacted their agent, who arranged visas for them to travel to the United States of America (USA). They flew to Qatar on 17 January 2010 and to the USA on 18 January 2010. The Applicants came to Canada and claimed refuge status on 1 February 2010.
[8]
In her Personal Information Form (PIF), the Secondary Applicant adopted the Principal Applicant's narrative for her claim. The RPD joined the Applicants' claims under subsection 49(1) of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
SOR/2002-228 and heard the claims together on 14 July 2011. -Only the Principal Applicant testified at the hearing. The RPD made its Decision on 21 July 2011 and notified the Applicants of the outcome on 26 July 2011.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[9]
The RPD denied the Applicants' claims because it found they did not have a well-founded fear of persecution under section 96 of the Act. It also found that the Applicants had an internal flight alternative (IFA) available to them in Colombo. Further, any risk the Applicants faced was a generalized one, which excluded them from protection under section 97 of the Act.
Credibility
[10]
The RPD concluded that the Applicants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution because the Principal Applicant was not credible. Although he had described his capture in November 2009 in his PIF, the Principal Applicant had not mentioned that his captors were from the Karuna faction until the hearing. The RPD found this detail was an embellishment. The RPD also said that if he had been captured by paramilitaries working with the Sri Lankan security forces he would have been taken to a police station or army camp and not a house as he said in his PIF
[11]
The RPD also found that the Principal Applicant was not wanted by Sri Lankan security forces. His captors were not members of the security forces and he was released two days after they abducted him and the Secondary Applicant paid them a bribe. The Applicants were also left alone after the police check at their hotel in Colombo; they were not arrested, which showed that the police were not interested in them. Further, the Applicants left Sri Lanka without incident. The RPD reasoned that if they were allowed to leave Sri Lanka freely, this showed they were not on any watch list, even if their agent had bribed the authorities at the airport, as they said he had.
[12]
Since the Applicants claimed protection on the basis of the risk they faced from the Karuna faction, which was associated with Sri Lankan security forces, the fact that they were not wanted by the security forces meant they were not at risk on return to Sri Lanka. The RPD concluded the Applicants' fear of persecution was not well-founded on this basis.
Internal Flight Alternative
[13]
In the alternative to its finding that their fear was not well-founded, the RPD found that the Applicants had an IFA available to them in Colombo.
[14]
When the RPD raised the IFA issue at the hearing, the Principal Applicant said he could not live in Colombo because the Karuna faction would find him there.
[15]
The RPD found that the Applicants could settle in Colombo because there is a large Tamil population there. The Applicants have relatives in Colombo and the Principal Applicant can speak Sinhalese - the majority language in Colombo - although he is not fluent. The Principal Applicant also owned and operated his own business in Trincomalee, which the RPD found he could also do in Colombo.
[16]
The RPD also looked at whether the Applicants would be at risk in Colombo. It noted that the war between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government is over and, according to a report from the Danish Immigration Service, the situation for Tamils in Sri Lanka has improved. It also acknowledged that some risk remained in Sri Lanka to young Tamil men and that 30% of the population in Colombo is Tamil, while 41% of the population is Sinhalese. The RPD concluded, however, that the Applicants' risk of persecution in Colombo is low because they are not young Tamil men and do not have a profile which would attract undue attention from the security forces.
[17]
The RPD concluded that the Applicants have an IFA available in Colombo which meets both requirements established by the jurisprudence.
Generalized Risk
[18]
The RPD also found that any risk the Applicants faced was generalized, which was fatal to any claim under section 97.
[19]
The RPD noted that extortion by paramilitaries and Sri Lankan security forces is a problem in post-civil-war Sri Lanka. It also noted that extortion is on the rise there. The RPD found that the Applicants would be former residents returning from abroad and might be attractive targets for extortion on that basis. However, although some people might be targeted for their wealth, this does not remove them from a general risk of crime (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). While they might be perceived as wealthy, any risk the Applicants faced was generalized and so excluded them from protection under paragraph 97(1)(
b
) of the Act.
ISSUES
[20]
The Applicants raise the following issues in this case:
1. Whether the RPD's credibility finding was reasonable;
2. Whether the RPD's finding they did not have a well-founded fear of persecution was reasonable;
3. Whether the RPD's finding they had an IFA available was reasonable;
4. Whether the RPD's finding they faced a generalized risk was reasonable.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[21]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[22]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) (QL) the Federal Court of Appeal held at paragraph 4 the standard of review on a credibility finding is reasonableness. Further, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Max Teitelbaum held that findings of credibility are central to the RPD's finding of fact and are therefore to be evaluated on a standard of review of reasonableness. Finally, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Michael Kelen held at paragraph 17 that the standard of review on a credibility determination is reasonableness. The standard of review on the first issue is reasonableness.
[23]
The standard of review applicable to the RPD's finding that the Applicants' fear of persecution was not well-founded is reasonableness. Justice Sandra Simpson found that the standard of review on this issue was reasonableness at paragraph 7 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Justice Leonard Mandamin made a similar finding in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[24]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Frank Gibson held at paragraph 13 that the RPD's finding that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  was available is patent unreasonableness. More recently, Justice Luc Martineau held at paragraph 8 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that the standard of review on an IFA finding is reasonableness (see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The standard of review on the third issue is reasonableness.
[25]
The reasonableness standard is also applicable to the RPD's finding that the Applicants faced a generalized risk in Sri Lanka. Justice David Near determined that reasonableness was the appropriate standard of review on this issue in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As Justice André Scott found in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a generalized risk finding involves questions of mixed fact and law to be evaluated on a standard of reasonableness (paragraphs 13 and 14). The standard of review on the fourth issue is reasonableness (see also  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[26]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
STATUTORY PROVISIONS
[27]
The following provisions of the Act are applicable in this case:
Convention refugee
96.

(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
[...]
ARGUMENTS
The Applicants
[28]
The Applicants say the RPD ignored evidence when it found they are not Convention refugees. The RPD did not consider how the disappearance of Subangini from Sri Lanka and her successful refugee claim means that they would be exposed to a risk of persecution. They point to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> where Justice Elizabeth Heneghan held that
In my opinion, the Board committed a reviewable error in failing to consider the impact upon the Applicants, in Sri Lanka, of the finding that their daughter had been found to be a Convention refugee and would not accompany them back to Sri Lanka. The Board did not consider that this finding might expose the Applicants to persecutory treatment by the SLA and the Sri Lankan authorities on the basis of a suspicion that their daughter had been recruited by the LTTE. The Board did not apply the law which requires that a determination of Convention refugee status must be a forward-looking inquiry: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.). The Board's conclusion that the SLA would not suspect them of supporting the LTTE in the future is a reversible error, having regard to the fact that the Applicants would be returned to Sri Lanka without their daughter. That is a circumstance that could feed suspicion by the SLA that the daughter has joined the LTTE.
[29]
When the RPD did not account for the risk the Applicants faced by association with Subangini, it committed the same error as occurred in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[30]
The Applicants also argue that the RPD's finding that the Principal Applicant was not credible was unreasonable. Although he added the detail about his captors being Karuna members at the hearing, he only learned this himself after he submitted PIF to the RPD. In his PIF, he wrote that his captors pushed him into a white van. He later learned from members of his community that Karuna members travel in white vans. Contrary to the RPD's conclusion, the Principal Applicant provided spontaneous and credible testimony, so the RPD's credibility finding is unreasonable.
Risk
[31]
The RPD's conclusion on risk was unreasonable because it was based on an erroneous inference. The Applicants point to the Principal Applicant's testimony that he was targeted by Karuna members and that their agent paid a bribe at the airport. This testimony shows that the RPD's inference from their trouble-free exit through the Colombo airport was unreasonable. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [32]
The Applicants also challenge the RPD's finding that they have an IFA. This finding is unreasonable because, at sixty years old, they are elderly and it will be difficult for them to relocate. The RPD based its IFA finding in part on the fact that the Principal Applicant's father was a police sergeant who spoke Sinhalese, but the Applicants say the Principal Applicant cannot speak Sinhalese very well. They also direct the Court's attention to the Principal Applicant's testimony that the Colombo police told them to leave Colombo.
[33]
The Applicants also say that the documentary evidence before the RPD shows that they actually face a risk in Colombo. When it concluded that their risk was low, the RPD ignored a report from the Department of State in the USA which their counsel raised at the RPD hearing. The RPD's conclusion on IFA is unreasonable because the RPD ignored this evidence.
The Respondent
[34]
The Respondent argues that the Decision should stand because it was based on reasonable credibility findings and a reasonable finding that the Applicants have an IFA available to them.
[35]
Subangini's refugee claim was not relevant, so it was not an error for the RPD not to consider it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) Justice Marc Nadon had this to say at paragraph 8:
Before concluding, however, I would like to make the following comments. In paragraph 31 of his memorandum, the applicant asserts that the Refugee Division accepted his sister's refugee claim on April 9, 1992. The mere fact of proving that his sister had been found to be a refugee does not carry a lot of weight, since the members of the Division who made that decision made it on the basis of the facts in the record. Why did the applicant not call his sister and brother-in-law to testify to establish that he is of Kurdish nationality? The Division was not bound by a decision made by another panel since it may be that the other panel made an incorrect decision.
[36]
The RPD was not obligated to consider Subangini's claim because each case must be determined on its own merits and the RPD is not bound by its own decisions (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[37]
It was reasonable for the RPD to conclude the Principal Applicant was not credible because he embellished his story. This Court has held that a failure to include a key fact in a PIF is an appropriate basis for an adverse credibility finding (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[38]
Although the Applicants challenge the RPD's finding that their fear was not well-founded, this finding was reasonable. The RPD based its conclusion on the following facts:
i. the Applicants were cleared after the police check at their hotel;
ii. the Principal Applicant was not taken to a police or army camp when he was abducted, though he said his abductors were associated with the Sri Lankan authorities;
iii. the Applicants had no trouble leaving Sri Lanka.
[39]
The Applicants have not shown that the RPD could not have drawn the inferences it did, so the Decision should stand.
[40]
The RPD properly applied the test for an  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), the Federal Court of Appeal held that claimants must demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed flight location. Claimants must also demonstrate that requiring them to seek refugee in the proposed location would be unreasonable in the circumstances. In the instant case, the Applicants did not demonstrate that they faced a serious possibility of persecution in Colombo. The RPD reasonably concluded that they were not at risk there and that it was reasonable for them to seek refuge in Colombo. The availability of an IFA is conclusive against a refugee claim, so the RPD's finding that the Applicants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection was reasonable. The Applicants are simply asking the Court to re-weigh the evidence.
ANALYSIS
[41]
The Applicants raise a number of issues for review but, in my view, the IFA finding is determinative and does not contain a reviewable error.
[42]
The Applicants say that the finding was based on the RPD's reasoning that the Principal Applicant's father was a sergeant in the police force who spoke Sinhalese. They say the Principal Applicant is elderly, his father is deceased, and he does not speak Sinhalese well.
[43]
A reading of the Decision reveals that the RPD was well aware of the factors the Applicants have raised and took into account a wide range of relevant considerations, some of which the Applicants do not even challenge. When these factors are reviewed against the documentary evidence, I do not think I can say that the IFA finding falls outside the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> range.
[44]
Although the RPD mistakenly said the Applicants had relatives in Colombo (they did have acquaintances there who they occasionally stayed with, and who visited the Applicants) this is not material enough to warrant setting the Decision aside. Nor do I think that the proposition for which Danish Immigration Service report is cited is undermined in any material way by the later April 2011 US DOS report.
[45]
In any event, the factors cited by the Applicants as to why Colombo is not a reasonable IFA are not in line with the governing jurisprudence. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Federal Court of Appeal had the following to say on point, at paragraphs 14 to 16:
I agree with Rothstein J., as he then was, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of our Court in Thirunavukkarasu does not exclude, as a relevant factor on the issue of the reasonableness of the IFA, the absence of relatives in or in the vicinity of the safe area. It makes it obvious though that more than the mere absence of relatives is needed in order to make an IFA unreasonable. Indeed, there is always some hardship, even undue hardship, involved when a person has to abandon the comfort of his home to leave in a different part of his country where he has to seek employment and start a new life away from relatives and friends. This is not, however, the kind of undue hardship that this Court was considering in Thirunavukkarasu.
We read the decision of Linden J.A. for this Court as setting up a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.
There are at least two reasons why it is important not to lower that threshold. First, as this Court said in Thirunavukkarasu, the definition of refugee under the Convention "requires claimants to be unable or unwilling by reason of fear of persecution to claim the protection of their home country in any part of that country". Put another way, what makes a person a refugee under the Convention is his fear of persecution by his home country in any part of that country. To expand and lower the standard for assessing reasonableness of the IFA is to fundamentally denature the definition of refugee: one becomes a refugee who has no fear of persecution and who would be better off in Canada physically, economically and emotionally than in a safe place in his own country.
[46]
On the evidence which was before the RPD, it was reasonable for it to conclude that the situation they faced in Colombo did not jeopardize the Applicants' lives or safety. They have not shown me that the factors they cite amount to a risk such that the Decision must be returned for reconsideration.
[47]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[48]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Russell
[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), en vue de soumettre à un contrôle judiciaire la décision datée du 21 juillet 2011 (la décision) par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a refusé la demande d'asile des demandeurs en qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ou de personnes à protéger aux termes des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.
CONTEXTE
[2]
Les demandeurs sont citoyens du Sri Lanka et vivent actuellement à Markham (Ontario). Ils sont tous deux âgés de soixante ans et ont une fille (Subangini) et des petits-enfants qui vivent au Canada, tout comme le frère et la sœur de la demanderesse.
[3]
Le demandeur principal dit qu'à l'époque où il vivait à Trincomalee (Sri Lanka) l'armée et la police nationales se présentaient souvent à son domicile. Lors du conflit opposant les Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (les TLET) et le gouvernement sri-lankais, des membres des TLET se présentaient parfois aussi à son domicile et exigeaient de l'argent. À deux occasions distinctes, il leur aurait remis 10 000 roupies - environ 80 $.
[4]
Le fils des demandeurs, Pradeep, a été enlevé par des inconnus en 2005, et on est sans nouvelles de lui depuis ce temps. Après cet enlèvement, les demandeurs ont envoyé leur autre fils, Prasanna, demander l'asile au Royaume-Uni (le R.-U.). Le dossier n'indique pas clairement quelle est la décision que les autorités ont finalement prise au Royaume-Uni à l'égard de cette demande. Subangini est arrivée au Canada en 2006 et elle a demandé l'asile. La SPR a rejeté sa demande; elle a toutefois été admise à titre de réfugiée le 29 octobre 2010 à la suite d'une demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR) (voir la page 284 du dossier certifié du tribunal (le DCT)).
[5]
Selon le demandeur principal, des membres de la police et de l'armée sri-lankaises l'ont un jour arrêté sur une route, près de Trincomalee. Ils ont pris de l'argent dans son portefeuille et ont fouillé ses autres bagages. Il dit aussi avoir déjà été détenu par des membres de la faction Karuna - un groupe paramilitaire associé à l'armée sri-lankaise - le 26 novembre 2009, après que le gouvernement eut défait les TLET en 2009. À cette occasion, deux hommes armés de pistolets l'ont enlevé de chez lui, lui ont bandé les yeux et l'ont emmené à bord d'un véhicule jusqu'à une maison située à une certaine distance de chez lui. Les hommes l'ont interrogé sur ses fils et l'ont frappé à coups de bâton et à mains nues. Après l'avoir gardé en captivité pendant deux jours, les hommes l'ont relâché parce que la demanderesse leur avait versé de l'argent.
[6]
Les demandeurs ont décidé de quitter le Sri Lanka et ils ont pris à cet égard les dispositions nécessaires par l'entremise d'un agent. Ils ont vendu leur maison pour payer leur passage et sont partis à Colombo (Sri Lanka) le 5 janvier 2010.
[7]
Lors du séjour des demandeurs à Colombo, des agents de police se sont présentés à l'endroit où ils vivaient et les ont interrogés. Selon le demandeur principal, les agents lui ont posé des questions sur sa carte d'identité nationale et lui ont dit de quitter Colombo. Les demandeurs ont communiqué avec leur agent, qui s'est organisé pour obtenir des visas leur permettant de se rendre aux États-Unis. Ils ont pris l'avion pour le Qatar le 17 janvier 2010 et, ensuite, pour les États-Unis le 18 janvier 2010. Les demandeurs sont arrivés au Canada et ont demandé l'asile le 1er février 2010.
[8]
Dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (le FRP), la demanderesse a adopté, pour sa demande d'asile, l'exposé circonstancié du demandeur principal. La SPR a joint les demandes d'asile des demandeurs en vertu du paragraphe 49(1) des
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-228, et a entendu les demandes ensemble le 14 juillet 2011. Seul le demandeur principal a témoigné à l'audience. La SPR a rendu sa décision le 21 juillet 2011 et a fait part aux demandeurs de l'issue de leur demande le 26 juillet 2011.
DÉCISION FAISANT L'OBJET DU PRÉSENT CONTRÔLE
[9]
La SPR a rejeté les demandes d'asile des demandeurs parce qu'elle a conclu que ces derniers ne craignaient pas avec raison d'être persécutés au sens de l'article 96 de la Loi. Elle a également conclu qu'ils disposaient d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) à Colombo. De plus, tout risque auquel les demandeurs étaient exposés était de nature généralisée, ce qui les excluait de la protection que confère l'article 97 de la Loi.
La crédibilité
[10]
La SPR a conclu que les demandeurs ne craignaient pas avec raison d'être persécutés car le demandeur principal n'était pas digne de foi. Ce dernier avait décrit dans son FRP l'enlèvement qu'il avait subi en novembre 2009, mais ce n'était qu'à l'audience qu'il avait mentionné que ses ravisseurs appartenaient à la faction Karuna. Elle a conclu que ce détail n'était qu'un enjolivement. Elle a également dit que s'il avait été capturé par des éléments paramilitaires travaillant avec les forces de sécurité du Sri Lanka, il aurait été amené à un poste de police ou à un camp de l'armée, et non pas dans une maison, comme il l'avait indiqué dans son FRP.
[11]
La SPR a également conclu que le demandeur principal n'était pas recherché par les forces de sécurité du Sri Lanka. Ses ravisseurs n'étaient pas membres des forces de sécurité et ils l'avaient relâché deux jours après son enlèvement et après que la demanderesse eut versé de l'argent. De plus, la police, après avoir fait un contrôle à l'hôtel où ils logeaient à Colombo, avait laissé les demandeurs tranquilles; ils n'avaient pas été arrêtés, ce qui dénotait que la police ne s'intéressait pas à eux. Par ailleurs, les demandeurs avaient quitté le Sri Lanka sans encombre. La SPR a conclu que si on les avait laissés quitter librement le Sri Lanka, cela montrait qu'ils n'étaient inscrits sur aucune liste de personnes recherchées, même si, comme ils l'avaient dit, leur agent avait soudoyé les autorités à l'aéroport.
[12]
Comme les demandeurs sollicitaient une protection à cause du risque qu'ils couraient de la part de la faction Karuna, laquelle était associée aux forces de sécurité sri-lankaises, le fait que ces dernières n'étaient pas à leur recherche signifiait qu'ils ne courraient pas de risques s'ils retournaient au Sri Lanka. La SPR a conclu que, pour cette raison, la crainte de persécution des demandeurs n'était pas fondée.
La possibilité de refuge intérieur
[13]
Subsidiairement à sa conclusion selon laquelle la crainte des demandeurs n'était pas fondée, la SPR a conclu que ces derniers disposaient d'une PRI à Colombo.
[14]
Quand la SPR a évoqué la question de la PRI à l'audience, le demandeur principal a déclaré qu'il ne pourrait pas vivre à Colombo parce que la faction Karuna le retrouverait dans cette ville.
[15]
La SPR a conclu que les demandeurs pouvaient s'établir à Colombo parce que cette ville compte une vaste population tamoule. Les demandeurs ont des parents à Colombo et le demandeur principal parle le cinghalais - la langue de la majorité à Colombo - même si ce n'est pas couramment. Le demandeur principal, de plus, possédait et exploitait sa propre entreprise à Trincomalee, et la SPR a conclu qu'il pouvait le faire aussi à Colombo.
[16]
La SPR a également examiné si les demandeurs courraient un risque à Colombo. Elle a fait remarquer que la guerre opposant les TLET et le gouvernement sri-lankais est terminée et que, d'après un rapport du Service de l'immigration du Danemark, la situation des Tamouls au Sri Lanka s'est améliorée. Elle a également reconnu qu'au Sri Lanka les jeunes hommes tamouls courent encore des risques et que 30 % de la population de Colombo est tamoule, tandis que 41 % est cinghalaise. La SPR a toutefois conclu que le risque de persécution que courraient les demandeurs à Colombo était faible parce qu'ils n'étaient pas de jeunes hommes tamouls et qu'ils n'avaient pas un profil qui attirerait une attention excessive de la part des forces de sécurité.
[17]
La SPR a conclu que les demandeurs disposent d'une PRI à Colombo, qui satisfait aux deux exigences qu'établit la jurisprudence.
Le risque généralisé
[18]
La SPR a également conclu que le risque auquel s'exposaient les demandeurs était de nature généralisée, ce qui porte un coup fatal à toute demande d'asile présentée en vertu de l'article 97.
[19]
La SPR a fait remarquer qu'au Sri Lanka, depuis la fin de la guerre civile, les mesures d'extorsion que prennent les paramilitaires et les forces de sécurité sri-lankaises posent des problèmes. Elle a ajouté que, dans ce pays, les cas d'extorsion sont en hausse. Les demandeurs, a-t-elle conclu, seraient d'anciens résidants rentrant au pays de l'étranger et ils pourraient être, pour cette raison, d'intéressantes cibles d'extorsion. Cependant, même si certaines personnes peuvent être prises pour cibles à cause de leur richesse, cela ne les exclut pas d'un risque général de criminalité (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Il se pouvait qu'on les considère comme riches, mais les risques quelconques auxquels les demandeurs s'exposaient étaient de nature généralisée, et ils les excluaient ainsi de toute protection au sens de l'alinéa 97(1)
b
) de la Loi.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[20]
Les demandeurs soulèvent les questions suivantes en l'espèce:
1. si la conclusion de la SPR en matière de crédibilité est raisonnable;
2. si la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les demandeurs ne craignent pas avec raison d'être persécutés est raisonnable;
3. si la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les demandeurs disposent d'une PRI est raisonnable;
4. si la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les demandeurs s'exposent à un risque de nature généralisée est raisonnable.
NORME DE CONTRÔLE APPLICABLE
[21]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a décrété qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de procéder à une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle. Lorsque la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à une question particulière est bien établie par la jurisprudence, il est loisible à la cour de révision de l'adopter. Ce n'est que dans les cas où cette recherche se révèle infructueuse que cette cour se doit d'examiner les quatre facteurs que comporte l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle.
[22]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) (QL), la Cour d'appel fédérale a conclu au paragraphe 4 que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à une conclusion relative à la crédibilité est la raisonnabilité. De plus, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Max Teitelbaum a statué que les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité se situent au cœur même de la conclusion de fait que tire la SPR et qu'il convient donc de les évaluer selon la norme de la raisonnabilité. Enfin, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Michael Kelen a décrété, au paragraphe 17, que la norme de contrôle à appliquer aux conclusions en matière de crédibilité est la raisonnabilité. La norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la première question est donc la raisonnabilité.
[23]
La norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la crainte de persécution des demandeurs n'était pas fondée est la raisonnabilité. La juge Sandra Simpson a conclu, au paragraphe 7 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à cette question est la raisonnabilité. Le juge Leonard Mandamin est arrivé à une conclusion semblable dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[24]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Frank Gibson a statué au paragraphe 13 que, en ce qui concerne la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle une PRI est disponible, la norme de contrôle est la décision manifestement déraisonnable. Plus récemment, le juge Luc Martineau, au paragraphe 8 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a décrété que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à une conclusion relative à une PRI est la décision raisonnable (voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la troisième question est donc la raisonnabilité.
[25]
La norme de la raisonnabilité est également celle qui s'applique à la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les demandeurs s'exposaient à un risque généralisé au Sri Lanka. Le juge David Near a statué que la raisonnabilité était la norme de contrôle qui s'appliquait à cette question dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 16. Comme l'a conclu le juge André Scott dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  une conclusion de risque généralisé comporte des questions mixtes de fait et de droit qu'il convient d'évaluer selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (paragraphes 13 et 14). La norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la quatrième question est donc la raisonnabilité (voir aussi la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[26]
Quand on contrôle une décision en fonction de la norme de la raisonnabilité, l'analyse a trait à « la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ». Voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, ainsi que l'arrêt
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Autrement dit, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la décision rendue en l'espèce est déraisonnable, en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».

[...]
ARGUMENTS DES PARTIES
Les demandeurs
[28]
Les demandeurs disent que la SPR a fait abstraction de divers éléments de preuve lorsqu'elle a conclu qu'ils n'avaient pas la qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention. Elle n'a pas examiné la question de savoir comment la disparition de Subangini du Sri Lanka et sa demande d'asile fructueuse signifiaient qu'ils s'exposeraient à un risque de persécution. Ils invoquent la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s laquelle la juge Elizabeth Heneghan a déclaré:
À mon avis, la Commission a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle en ne tenant pas compte des conséquences pour les demandeurs, une fois au Sri Lanka, de la conclusion selon laquelle leur fille est une réfugiée au sens de la Convention et ne les accompagnerait pas au Sri Lanka. La Commission n'a pas pris en considération le fait que cette conclusion pourrait exposer les demandeurs à la persécution par l'armée sri-lankaise et par les autorités sri-lankaises, basée sur le soupçon que leur fille avait été recrutée par les TLET. La Commission n'a pas appliqué la règle de droit qui exige qu'une décision sur le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention tienne compte de l'avenir. Voir
Mileva c
.
Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration)
, [1991] 3 C.F. 398 (C.A.). La conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle l'armée sri-lankaise ne les soupçonnerait pas d'appuyer les TLET à l'avenir constitue une erreur susceptible de contrôle, si l'on tient compte du fait que les demandeurs seraient renvoyés au Sri Lanka sans leur fille. Il s'agit là d'une situation qui pourrait alimenter les soupçons de l'armée sri-lankaise selon lesquels la fille s'est jointe aux TLET.
[29]
En ne tenant pas compte du risque auquel s'exposaient les demandeurs en étant associés à Subangini, la SPR a commis la même erreur que dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[30]
Les demandeurs font également valoir que la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le demandeur principal n'était pas digne de foi est déraisonnable. Il a ajouté à l'audience le détail relatif au fait que ses ravisseurs étaient membres de la faction Karuna, mais lui-même ne l'avait su qu'après avoir soumis son FRP à la SPR. Dans son FRP, il a écrit que ses ravisseurs l'avaient poussé dans une camionnette blanche. Il avait plus tard appris par des membres de sa collectivité que les membres de la faction Karuna se déplacent dans des camionnettes blanches. Contrairement à ce qu'a conclu la SPR, le demandeur principal a présenté un témoignage spontané et digne de foi, ce qui fait que la conclusion que la SPR a tirée au sujet de sa crédibilité est déraisonnable.
Le risque
[31]
La conclusion que la SPR a tirée au sujet du risque est déraisonnable car elle repose sur une inférence erronée. Les demandeurs font état du témoignage du demandeur principal selon lequel celui-ci a été pris pour cible par des membres de la faction Karuna et que leur agent a payé un pot-de-vin à l'aéroport. Il ressort de ce témoignage que l'inférence que la SPR a tirée à propos de leur sortie sans encombre du pays, par l'aéroport de Colombo, est déraisonnable.
La PRI
[32]
Les demandeurs contestent également la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle ils disposent d'une PRI. Cette conclusion est déraisonnable parce que, à l'âge de soixante ans, ils sont âgés et qu'il leur sera difficile de s'installer ailleurs. La SPR a fondé sa conclusion relative à la PRI en partie sur le fait que le père du demandeur principal était un sergent de police qui parlait le cinghalais, mais les demandeurs disent que le demandeur principal ne s'exprime pas très bien dans cette langue. Ils attirent également l'attention de la Cour sur le témoignage du demandeur principal selon lequel la police de Colombo leur a dit de quitter la ville.
[33]
Les demandeurs disent aussi qu'il ressort de la preuve documentaire soumise à la SPR qu'ils s'exposent réellement à un risque à Colombo. En concluant que ce risque était faible, la SPR a fait abstraction d'un rapport du Département d'État des États-Unis que leur conseil avait invoqué à l'audience. La conclusion de la SPR au sujet de la PRI est déraisonnable car elle a fait abstraction de cet élément de preuve.
Le défendeur
[34]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il y a lieu de maintenir la décision parce que celle-ci repose sur des conclusions raisonnables quant à la crédibilité, ainsi que sur la conclusion raisonnable selon laquelle les demandeurs disposent d'une PRI.
[35]
La demande d'asile de Subangini n'était pas pertinente, de sorte que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur en en faisant abstraction. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), le juge Marc Nadon indique ceci, au paragraphe 8:
Avant de conclure, par ailleurs, je désire faire les commentaires suivants. Au paragraphe 31 de son mémoire, le requérant allègue que la Section du statut a reconnu le bien-fondé de la revendication de sa sœur par une décision en date du 9 avril 1992. Le fait de simplement prouver que sa sœur avait été déclarée réfugiée ne porte pas beaucoup de poids puisque les membres de la Section qui ont rendu cette décision l'ont rendue compte tenu des faits au dossier. Pourquoi le requérant n'a-t-il pas fait témoigner sa sœur et son beau-frère pour démontrer sa nationalité Kurde? La Section n'était pas liée par une décision rendue par un autre panel puisqu'il est possible que l'autre panel ait rendue une décision erronée.
[36]
La SPR n'était pas tenue de prendre en considération la demande d'asile de Subangini parce que chaque affaire doit être tranchée en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres et que la SPR n'est pas liée par ses propres décisions (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[37]
Il était raisonnable que la SPR conclue que le demandeur principal n'était pas digne de foi parce qu'il avait enjolivé son récit. La Cour considère que le fait de ne pas inclure un élément important dans un FRP est un motif valable pour tirer une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[38]
Même si les demandeurs contestent la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle leur crainte est dénuée de fondement, cette conclusion est raisonnable. La SPR a fondé cette conclusion sur les faits suivants:
i. les demandeurs n'ont pas eu de problèmes après que la police eut procédé à un contrôle à leur hôtel;
ii. le demandeur principal n'a pas été amené à un poste de police ou un camp de l'armée quand il a été enlevé, même s'il a déclaré que ses ravisseurs étaient associés aux autorités sri-lankaises;
iii. les demandeurs n'ont pas eu de difficulté à quitter le Sri Lanka.
[39]
Les demandeurs n'ont pas établi que la SPR ne pouvait tirer les inférences auxquelles elle est arrivée, de sorte que la décision doit être maintenue.
[40]
La SPR a appliqué comme il faut le critère relatif à l'existence d'une PRI. Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), la Cour d'appel fédérale a conclu que les demandeurs doivent établir qu'ils s'exposent à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution dans le lieu de refuge proposé. Les demandeurs doivent également établir qu'il serait déraisonnable dans les circonstances d'exiger qu'ils trouvent refuge dans le lieu proposé. En l'espèce, les demandeurs n'ont pas établi qu'ils s'exposaient à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution à Colombo. La SPR a conclu de manière raisonnable qu'ils ne couraient pas de risque à cet endroit et qu'il était raisonnable qu'ils trouvent refuge à Colombo. La disponibilité d'une PRI est concluante à l'encontre d'une demande d'asile, de sorte que la SPR a conclu de manière raisonnable que les demandeurs n'ont pas la qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ou de personnes à protéger. Ils demandent simplement à la Cour de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve.
ANALYSE
[41]
Les demandeurs soulèvent un certain nombre de questions à contrôler, mais, à mon avis, la conclusion relative à la PRI est déterminante et ne renferme pas d'erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[42]
Les demandeurs disent que la conclusion découle du raisonnement de la SPR selon lequel le père du demandeur principal était sergent au sein du service de police et parlait le cinghalais. Ils disent que le demandeur principal est âgé, que son père est décédé et qu'il ne s'exprime pas couramment en cinghalais.
[43]
Il ressort de la décision de la SPR que cette dernière était bien consciente des facteurs que les demandeurs ont évoqués et qu'elle a tenu compte d'un large éventail de facteurs pertinents, des facteurs que les demandeurs, dans certains cas, ne contestent même pas. Si l'on examine ces facteurs par rapport à la preuve documentaire, je ne crois pas pouvoir dire que la conclusion relative à la PRI n'appartient pas aux issues dont il est question dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[44]
Même si la SPR a déclaré par erreur que les demandeurs avaient des parents à Colombo (ils y avaient des connaissances chez qui ils logeaient à l'occasion et qui leur rendaient visite), cela n'est pas assez important pour qu'il soit justifié d'annuler la décision. Je ne crois pas non plus que la thèse à l'appui de laquelle le rapport du Service de l'immigration du Danemark est cité soit minée de façon importante par le rapport du Département d'État des États-Unis qui a été publié plus tard, en avril 2011.
[45]
Quoi qu'il en soit, les facteurs dont les demandeurs font état pour expliquer pourquoi Colombo n'est pas une PRI raisonnable ne cadrent pas avec la jurisprudence applicable. Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour d'appel fédérale déclare ceci à cet égard, aux paragraphes 14 à 16:
Je partage l'avis exprimé par le juge Rothstein, alors juge à la Section de première instance, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  déclare que la décision de notre Cour dans l'arrêt
Thirunavukkarasu
n'exclut pas comme facteur à prendre en considération dans l'examen du caractère raisonnable de la PRI l'absence de parents à l'endroit sûr ou dans les environs. Toutefois, la Cour y établit clairement que l'absence de parents n'est pas en soi un élément suffisant pour que la PRI soit déraisonnable. Lorsqu'une personne doit abandonner la douceur de son foyer pour aller s'installer dans une autre partie du pays, y trouver du travail et recommencer sa vie loin de sa famille et de ses amis, elle est assurément confrontée à des épreuves, et même à des épreuves indues. Toutefois, ce ne sont pas là les épreuves indues dont notre Cour fait état dans l'arrêt
Thirunavukkarasu
.
Selon nous, la décision du juge Linden, pour la Cour d'appel, indique qu'il faille placer la barre très haut lorsqu'il s'agit de déterminer ce qui est déraisonnable. Il ne faut rien de moins que l'existence de conditions qui mettraient en péril la vie et la sécurité d'un revendicateur tentant de se relocaliser temporairement en lieu sûr. De plus, il faut une preuve réelle et concrète de l'existence de telles conditions. L'absence de parents à l'endroit sûr, prise en soi ou conjointement avec d'autres facteurs, ne peut correspondre à une telle condition que si cette absence a pour conséquence que la vie ou la sécurité du revendicateur est mise en cause. Cela est bien différent des épreuves indues que sont la perte d'un emploi ou d'une situation, la diminution de la qualité de vie, le renoncement à des aspirations, la perte d'une personne chère et la frustration des attentes et des espoirs d'une personne.
Il y a au moins deux motifs qui font qu'il est important de ne pas baisser la barre. Premièrement, comme notre Cour l'a dit dans
Thirunavukkarasu
, la définition de réfugié au sens de la Convention exige que « les demandeurs de statut ne puissent ni ne veuillent, du fait qu'ils craignent d'être persécutés, se réclamer de la protection de leur pays d'origine et ce, dans n'importe quelle partie de ce pays ». En d'autres mots, ce qui fait qu'une personne est un réfugié au sens de la Convention, c'est sa crainte d'être persécutée par son pays d'origine quel que soit l'endroit où elle se trouve dans ce pays. Le fait d'élargir ou de rabaisser la norme d'évaluation du caractère raisonnable de la PRI dénature de façon fondamentale la définition de réfugié: on devient un réfugié sans avoir la crainte d'être persécuté et du fait que la vie au Canada serait meilleure sur le plan matériel, économique et affectif que dans un endroit sûr de son propre pays.
[46]
Au vu de la preuve soumise à la SPR, il était raisonnable que celle-ci conclue que la situation à laquelle les demandeurs devaient faire face à Colombo ne mettait pas en péril leur vie ou leur sécurité. Ces derniers ne m'ont pas montré que les facteurs dont ils font état sont assimilables à un risque tel qu'il convient de renvoyer la décision en vue de la tenue d'un nouvel examen.
[47]
Les avocates conviennent qu'il n'y a pas de question à certifier, et la Cour est du même avis.
JUGEMENT
[48]
LA COUR STATUE que:
1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
2. Il n'y a pas de question à certifier.
