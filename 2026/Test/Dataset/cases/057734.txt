[1]
Roy, J.
: This is an application for judicial review made pursuant to section 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the "Act"). The applicant challenges the decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "RPD") on February 7, 2013, finding the applicant to be neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.
Facts
[2]
This case has peculiar facts which require that they be presented more expansively than usual.
[3]
The applicant is a citizen of Morocco in her early thirties. Her refugee application was made upon arrival in Canada on September 29, 2010, but the facts that give rise to the application begin in January of 2008.
[4]
The applicant met in January 2008 a man who has been granted Canadian citizenship, and was originally from Morocco. That man, who would become her husband, was then on a visit to Morocco. After his return to Canada (he is resident of Mississauga, in Ontario) they pursued a relationship over the Internet.
[5]
At that time, he was separated from his second wife and in the process of obtaining a divorce.
[6]
The future husband came back to Morocco in December 2008 and the relationship continued to evolve, moving from friendship into romance. The future husband's divorce from his second wife came through on July 21, 2009. The applicant got married on August 2, 2009. Her new husband left Morocco fifteen days later, on August 17, 2009. He would come back for another two-week visit between April 23 and May 10, 2010. It would appear that their conjugal life was for a total of thirty-five days.
[7]
The applicant asserts that on their wedding night her husband changed. He began demanding that the applicant follow a diet and undergo cosmetic surgery. She was also subjected to physical and psychological violence, including many sexual assaults. It seems that the husband was disappointed to learn of the limited means of his new wife's family. The applicant would have confided in her mother who counselled that all relationships are difficult in the beginning.
[8]
In December 2009, the husband submitted a sponsorship request in favour of his new wife in order to join him in Canada. A permanent residence visa was received on July 9, 2010. However, the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) shows that the applicant's husband asked for a divorce from the applicant on July 10, 2010 and would have indicated that the marriage was one of convenience.
[9]
The husband withdrew his sponsorship on September 1, 2010. The Minister's records show that the applicant was contacted on September 1, 2010 and advised to present herself at the Canadian Embassy for a visa cancellation. The applicant testified that she received only one telephone call from the Embassy and she believed that this was merely a message from an anonymous caller and did not take it seriously. Indeed, after the phone call, she checked the Citizenship and Immigration Canada website and did not find an indication that her sponsorship had been cancelled.
[10]
Thus, she caught a flight from Morocco to Canada on September 29, 2010 and, upon her arrival in Montreal, she was confronted with the fact that her visa was void. She claimed refugee status there and then.
[11]
Her refugee claim is based on her fear that if she is returned to Morocco, her family and others would consider her to be dishonoured. Furthermore, after the divorce was pronounced, in 2011, her ex-husband would have called her family in order to defame her. She fears him because he abuses drugs and alcohol and was well connected with people who could harm her. As for her father, she claims that he is very strict and suffers from a psychiatric condition, which required several periods of hospitalization.
[12]
And then, there are witnesses who appeared before the RPD. There is the brother-in-law of her aunt with whom she had initially sought temporary lodging in Montreal upon her arrival. He depicted the applicant as being involved in the hashish trade, with her aunt, in Montreal. Furthermore, she would have been involved in social security and income tax frauds and would have been trained to use guns in a terrorist camp. The aunt's brother-in-law made a number of other allegations against the applicant which appear to be rather fanciful. In return, the applicant contends that he tried to commit sexual assault on her, that he asked her to be part in social security and other types of frauds.
[13]
Another witness testified that he had been asked by the applicant's sister in October 2010, obviously shortly after her arrival in Canada, to assist. He hired her to work for his company at the start of 2011.
[14]
Finally, the applicant's sister testified in support of the applicant. She would confirm that the applicant's ex-husband defamed her to her father in Morocco and that he suffered from psychiatric issues.
[15]
Considering all of those facts, the applicant contends that she deserves the protection of sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
The decision
[16]
The RPD concluded that the credibility of the applicant with respect to her subjective fear of persecution was deficient. Her story is not credible and her reasons for coming to Canada cannot be believed. Noting that the applicant is fully aware that this is her husband's third marriage, she suffers psychological and physical violence at the hands of that person in the short period of time they were together. Notwithstanding the abuse, she agrees to be sponsored to come to Canada. Indeed, the RPD notes that when she arrives in Canada on September 29, 2010, the applicant has not seen her husband in many months. She claims that she found out at the airport that her visa had been cancelled. Evidently, it appears that she had not spoken either to her husband in many months prior to her departure from Morocco about the validity of her visa and the status of their marriage.
[17]
The record shows that the applicant had been contacted by the Canadian Embassy in Morocco on September 1, 2010. She claims that she did not know that divorce proceedings had been launched by what was to become her ex-husband. Actually, the ex-husband had been contacted by the Canadian authorities and he confirmed that the visa had to be cancelled.
[18]
It is not surprising that the RPD wished to discuss at length with the applicant the circumstances surrounding the phone call received from the Embassy. The transcript of the hearing is rather confusing. The RPD seems to understand that there were in fact numerous telephone conversations with Canadian representatives at the Canadian Embassy in Morocco. The applicant explains that she thought these were anonymous calls and that she took the request to attend for the purpose of cancelling the visa lightly ("J'ai pris l'appel à la légère.")
[19]
In the view of the RPD, at paragraph 22 of its decision:
. . . Le tribunal trouve pour le moins paradoxales et peu sérieuses les réponses de la demanderesse lorsqu'il s'agit d'immigrer dans un autre pays et que l'ambassade canadienne tente de communiquer avec cette personne pour prendre un rendez-vous et lui expliquer une situation. Elle a même ajouté qu'elle n'était pas sûre que son parrainage était annulé.
[20]
The behaviour of the applicant is considered by the RPD to be rather odd. While the applicant contends that she suffered psychological and physical violence at the hands of a husband she spent thirty-five days with, she ignores, one would even suggest she shows willful blindness, the calls by the Canadian Embassy to advise her that the sponsorship is cancelled.
[21]
The RPD is also critical of the applicant's contention that she continues to fear her ex-husband when he has not even tried to contact her since her arrival in 2010, a period of more than two years until the RPD decision. The RPD is of the view that the applicant tried to use the situation to her advantage to come to Canada. Accordingly, the RPD concludes that the burden on the applicant has not been discharged to prove that there is a well-founded fear of persecution in Morocco, if she were to return.
Arguments
[22]
The applicant makes two arguments before this Court. First, she contends that the tribunal has committed breaches of natural justice. Second, she claims that the assessment made of the case by the RPD is unreasonable, as per paragraph 47 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[23]
The argument about natural justice boils down to this. The applicant faults the RPD for not having provided fuller analysis of the three testimonies heard. For the applicant, there is an obligation at law to conduct an analysis of the testimony of witnesses; hence, she contends that the mandate of a tribunal is to evaluate the evidence it is presented with and then base its decision on that evidence. In support of that proposition, the applicant refers the Court to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) [
Via Rail
].
[24]
The applicant claims that the assessment of her credibility is lacking. She argues that the reference by the RPD to numerous conversations with Canadian personnel in Morocco in September 2009 is not accurate. There would have been one conversation which was followed up by an attempt on the part of the applicant to reach the Embassy.
[25]
Thus, she claims that the RPD did not understand the evidence or misconstrued it. Focus is again put on the contention of the applicant that she received only one phone call from the Embassy whereas the RPD referred to numerous exchanges. Indeed, the applicant seems to fault the Embassy for not having followed up following September 1, 2009.
[26]
The applicant argues that the RPD misconstrued her statement to the effect that she was hoping that in spite of the visa being cancelled, Canada would provide her with assistance. That, claims the applicant, does not show that she was aware that the visa had been cancelled prior to her departure from Morocco. That statement was made after she had arrived in Canada and found out that the visa had been cancelled. She was merely calling for empathy on the part of the Canadian authorities.
[27]
As far as the applicant is concerned, "[i]t is trite law that the tribunal has an obligation to provide clear reasons for its decision" (paragraph 99 of the Memorandum of Arguments). In her view, "there is a problem because the tribunal has not given clear reasons. [...] We submit this is problematic because at the end of the day, the Applicant should be able to read the decision and understand why her claim was denied;" (paragraph 98 of the Memorandum of Arguments).
[28]
As for the respondent, a high degree of deference is owed to an inferior tribunal that assesses facts and evidence. In this case, in the view of the respondent, the conclusions reached by the RPD are reasonably open to it in view of the evidence that was before it.
Analysis
[29]
The applicant argues that procedural fairness was infringed in this case because the RPD did not analyze in any detail the evidence of three witnesses. In the view of the applicant, this is in breach of natural justice and she refers to
Via Rail
,
supra
, to support that contention.
[30]
The difficulty with the argument is that more recent case-law does not support the argument. In
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
], the Supreme Court finds:
[16] Reasons may not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that does not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result under a reasonableness analysis. A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion (
Service Employees' International Union, Local No. 333 v. Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn.,
1973 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 382, at p. 391). In other words, if the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria are met.
[31]
In the case at bar, it is clear from the reasons of the RPD that it did not have to analyze the testimonies in order to reach its conclusion that the applicant did not have the required subjective fear. A Board is presumed to have taken into consideration all of the evidence, whether or not it specifically indicates having done so in its reasons, unless the contrary is shown (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Here, there is no failure to provide the applicant with procedural fairness in not reviewing the testimonies that, at the end of the day, were merely peripheral.
[32]
The other broad issue raised by the applicant concerns the conclusion of the RPD that the applicant's credibility was defective, leading to the conclusion that there has not been a satisfactory demonstration that the applicant had a subjective fear. The parties agree that the standard of review is reasonableness. I concur.
[33]
Thus, as for the failing demonstration that the applicant had a subjective fear, the applicant once again refers to decisions being in and of themselves subject to judicial review because of the inadequacy of reasons. The state of the law has changed since the case-law offered in support of that argument. In
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
,
supra
, the Supreme Court of Canada can hardly be any clearer:
[14] Read as a whole, I do not see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> as standing for the proposition that the "adequacy" of reasons is a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision, or as advocating that a reviewing court undertake two discrete analyses - one for the reasons and a separate one for the result (Donald J. M. Brown and John M. Evans,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada
(loose-leaf), at §§12:5330 and 12:5510). It is a more organic exercise - the reasons must be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes. This, it seems to me, is what the Court was saying in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> when it told reviewing courts to look at "the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes" (para. 47).
Here, I find it difficult to conclude that the outcome reached by the RPD is not reasonable. We understand fully why the RPD came to the conclusion it reached and that conclusion is supported by a fair assessment of the evidence as a whole.
[34]
The applicant chose to come to Canada on September 29, 2010 in spite of the fact that she had received at least one phone call from the Canadian Embassy in Morocco. In my view, whether or not there have been many attempts to reach the applicant is a red herring once the evidence as a whole has been considered properly. The last time the applicant had seen her then husband was in the spring of that year and he had communicated with the Canadian authorities since then for the purpose of advising that he was not supporting sponsorship for a wife he was in the process of divorcing. It stretches credulity to accept that, in circumstances like these, without even getting in contact with her husband in Canada, the applicant would catch a plane leaving for Montreal where, upon arriving, and being advised that her visa is cancelled, she immediately seeks refugee status.
[35]
I believe it is reasonable for the Board to conclude that the applicant was in fact seizing an opportunity that was presenting itself to leave Morocco. In my estimation, the understanding of the RPD that the applicant signaled her knowledge that her visa had been cancelled is reasonable. It is also understandable that the RPD would have queried, given the circumstances in which the applicant was leaving her country, that she would do so in spite of the physical and psychological violence she had suffered at the hands of her husband in the thirty-five days they lived together.
[36]
Basically, the Board did not believe that someone who has suffered physically and psychologically at the hands of her spouse, someone that she has not seen in five months, would leave Morocco to come and meet her husband in spite of a communication from the Canadian Embassy to the effect that there was, at least, some issue. That she would not have communicated with her husband after he started divorce proceedings and communicated with the Canadian authorities stretches credulity. Even more bizarre, the applicant would not have communicated with her sponsoring spouse for twenty-eight days, after the call received from the Embassy and before her departure for Canada. This would appear to be willful blindness. It is, in my estimation, quite reasonable on the part of the RPD to conclude that the motivation of the applicant was not what she presents it to be. Indeed, there is nothing wrong to seek a better life for oneself. However, that does not make someone a refugee or a person in need of protection.
[37]
It is also quite understandable that the RPD would not give credence to the claim that the ex-husband can seek to persecute her in Morocco when there is no evidence that there was any such persecution in Canada where the ex-husband resides, less than 500 kilometers from where his former wife is. Indeed, not only is there no convincing evidence to that effect, but there is no indication as to what could ever be his motivation for such action. Similarly, the evidence about the psychiatric issues suffered by the applicant's father was considered to fall short from establishing a subjective fear. I agree. Whatever were the reasons for that marriage, it does not follow that the applicant would be in fear for her safety if she returns to her country of nationality.
[38]
As a result, the application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification.
JUDGMENT
[39]
THIS COURT JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire fondée sur l'article 72 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi). La demanderesse conteste la décision du 7 février 2013 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (CISR) a conclu qu'elle n'était ni une réfugiée au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger.
Les faits
[2]
Les faits de la présente affaire sont particuliers et doivent être exposés de manière plus détaillée que d'habitude.
[3]
La demanderesse est une citoyenne marocaine dans la jeune trentaine. Elle a présenté sa demande d'asile à son arrivée au Canada le 29 septembre 2010, mais les faits à l'origine de sa demande remontent à janvier 2008.
[4]
À cette date, la demanderesse a rencontré un homme d'origine marocaine qui avait obtenu la citoyenneté canadienne. Cet homme, qu'elle a fini par épouser, était en visite au Maroc. À son retour au Canada (il réside à Mississauga, en Ontario), ils sont restés en contact par Internet.
[5]
À l'époque, il était séparé de sa deuxième épouse et en instance de divorce.
[6]
Le futur époux est retourné au Maroc en décembre 2008 et leur relation a suivi son cours, passant d'une amitié à une liaison amoureuse. Le divorce d'avec sa seconde épouse a été prononcé le 21 juillet 2009. La demanderesse s'est mariée le 2 août suivant. Son nouveau mari a quitté le Maroc quinze jours plus tard, le 17 août 2009. Il y est retourné en 2010, pour un séjour de deux semaines du 23 avril au 10 mai. Il semble que leur vie conjugale n'ait duré en tout que trente-cinq jours.
[7]
La demanderesse affirme que son mari a changé dès la nuit de noces. Il s'est mis à lui exiger qu'elle se mette au régime et qu'elle subisse une intervention de chirurgie esthétique. Elle aurait également été victime de violences physiques et psychologiques, y compris plusieurs agressions sexuelles. Il semble que l'époux ait été déçu d'apprendre que sa belle-famille avait peu de moyens. La demanderesse se serait confiée à sa mère qui lui aurait indiqué que toutes les relations étaient difficiles au début.
[8]
En décembre 2009, le mari de la demanderesse a présenté une demande de parrainage de sa nouvelle épouse afin qu'elle le rejoigne au Canada. Un visa de résident permanent a été délivré le 9 juillet 2010. Cependant, d'après les notes du Système du traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration (STIDI), le mari de la demanderesse a demandé le divorce le 10 juillet 2010 et aurait indiqué que son mariage en était un de convenance.
[9]
Le mari de la demanderesse a retiré sa demande de parrainage le 1er septembre 2010. D'après les dossiers du ministre, la demanderesse a été contactée le jour même et invitée à se présenter à l'ambassade canadienne en vue de l'annulation de son visa. La demanderesse a déclaré n'avoir reçu qu'un seul appel téléphonique de l'ambassade: elle pensait qu'il s'agissait d'un simple appel anonyme et elle ne l'a pas pris au sérieux. D'ailleurs, après cet appel elle a consulté le site Web de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada et n'y a pas trouvé d'indication que son parrainage avait été annulé.
[10]
Le 29 septembre 2010, elle a pris l'avion au Maroc à destination du Canada, et à son arrivée à Montréal on lui a fait remarquer que son visa avait été annulé. Elle a demandé l'asile sur place.
[11]
Sa demande d'asile repose sur la crainte d'être considérée comme déshonorée par sa famille et d'autres personnes si elle retourne au Maroc. Qui plus est, après que le divorce a été prononcé en 2011, son ex-mari aurait contacté sa famille pour la diffamer. La demanderesse a peur de son ex-mari parce qu'il consomme de la drogue et de l'alcool et que des personnes de son entourage sont susceptibles de s'en prendre à elle. Quant à son père, elle affirme qu'il est très strict et qu'il souffre d'un problème psychiatrique ayant nécessité plusieurs hospitalisations.
[12]
Il importe maintenant de s'attarder aux autres témoignages entendus par la SPR. Le beau-frère de sa tante, qui a temporairement hébergé la demanderesse à son arrivée à Montréal, a affirmé que la demanderesse se livrait au trafic du haschisch avec sa tante dans cette ville. Par ailleurs, elle aurait fraudé l'impôt et la sécurité sociale et aurait été entraînée au maniement des armes à feu dans un camp terroriste. Le beau-frère de la tante de la demanderesse a fait plusieurs autres allégations concernant la demanderesse qui semblent plutôt fantaisistes. Celle-ci soutient pour sa part qu'il a tenté de l'agresser sexuellement et qu'il lui a demandé de prendre part à diverses fraudes, notamment à la sécurité sociale.
[13]
Un autre témoin a indiqué que la sœur de la demanderesse avait prié le beau-frère de la tante de la demanderesse en octobre 2010, soit peu après l'arrivée de celle-ci au Canada, de lui venir en aide. Il l'a embauchée dans son entreprise au début de 2011.
[14]
Enfin, la sœur de la demanderesse a témoigné en sa faveur; elle a confirmé que son ex-mari avait contacté leur père au Maroc pour la diffamer et que ce dernier souffrait de problèmes psychiatriques.
[15]
Compte tenu de tous ces faits, la demanderesse soutient qu'elle mérite la protection des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.
La décision
[16]
La SPR a conclu que la demanderesse n'était pas crédible en ce qui concerne sa crainte subjective de persécution. Elle a estimé que son récit et les raisons l'ayant motivée à venir au Canada n'étaient pas dignes de foi. Elle a relevé que la demanderesse savait très bien qu'il s'agissait du troisième mariage de son mari, et qu'elle disait avoir subi des violences psychologiques et physiques aux mains de cet homme pendant la courte période au cours de laquelle ils ont vécu ensemble. Malgré les mauvais traitements, elle a accepté d'être parrainée au Canada. La SPR a d'ailleurs noté qu'à son arrivée au pays le 29 septembre 2010, la demanderesse n'avait pas vu son mari depuis plusieurs mois. Elle prétend avoir découvert à l'aéroport que son visa avait été annulé. Il paraît évident qu'elle n'a pas discuté avec son mari durant les nombreux mois qui ont précédé son départ du Maroc de la validité de son visa et de l'état de leur mariage.
[17]
D'après le dossier, l'ambassade canadienne au Maroc a appelé la demanderesse le 1er septembre 2010. Elle soutient qu'elle ignorait que des procédures de divorce avaient été entamées. En fait, son ex-mari a été contacté par les autorités canadiennes, et il a alors confirmé que le visa devait être annulé.
[18]
Il n'est pas étonnant que la SPR ait interrogé la demanderesse sur les circonstances ayant entouré l'appel de l'ambassade. La transcription de l'audience est plutôt déroutante. La SPR paraît avoir compris qu'il y avait eu en fait de nombreuses conversations téléphoniques avec des représentants canadiens de l'ambassade canadienne au Maroc. La demanderesse a expliqué qu'elle pensait qu'il s'agissait d'appels anonymes et qu'elle n'a pas pris au sérieux sa convocation à l'ambassade en vue de l'annulation du visa ( « J'ai pris l'appel à la légère »).
[19]
La SPR s'est exprimée comme suit au paragraphe 22 de sa décision:
[...] Le tribunal trouve pour le moins paradoxales et peu sérieuses les réponses de la demanderesse lorsqu'il s'agit d'immigrer dans un autre pays et que l'ambassade canadienne tente de communiquer avec cette personne pour prendre un rendez-vous et lui expliquer une situation. Elle a même ajouté qu'elle n'était pas sûre que son parrainage était annulé.
[20]
Le comportement de la demanderesse a paru plutôt étrange à la SPR. Elle prétendait avoir subi des violences psychologiques et physiques aux mains d'un mari auprès duquel elle a passé trente-cinq jours, mais elle a ignoré les appels de l'ambassade canadienne visant à l'informer que le parrainage avait été annulé, voire fait preuve d'aveuglement volontaire à cet égard.
[21]
La SPR a trouvé douteuse la déclaration de la demanderesse selon laquelle elle continue de craindre son ex-mari, alors qu'il n'a même pas essayé de la contacter depuis son arrivée en 2010, soit durant les deux années qui ont précédé la décision de la SPR. Celle-ci a estimé que la demanderesse a essayé de tourner la situation à son avantage pour entrer au Canada. La SPR a donc conclu que la demanderesse ne s'était pas acquittée de son fardeau de prouver qu'il existait une crainte fondée de persécution advenant son retour au Maroc.
Arguments
[22]
La demanderesse soumet deux arguments à la Cour. Elle affirme d'une part que le tribunal a commis des manquements à la justice naturelle, et d'autre part, que l'évaluation du dossier par la SPR est déraisonnable, au sens du paragraphe 47 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[23]
L'argument relatif à la justice naturelle se résume à ceci: la demanderesse reproche à la SPR de ne pas avoir procédé à une analyse suffisamment approfondie des trois témoignages entendus. Selon elle, il existe une obligation juridique d'analyser la déposition des témoins. Elle soutient donc que le mandat du tribunal est d'évaluer la preuve qui lui est présentée et de faire reposer sa décision sur cette preuve. Elle invoque à l'appui de son argument la décision de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) [
Via Rail
].
[24]
La demanderesse fait valoir que la SPR a mal apprécié sa crédibilité, et qu'elle ne rapporte pas fidèlement les nombreuses conversations que la demanderesse a eues avec le personnel de l'ambassade canadienne au Maroc en septembre 2009. Il n'y aurait eu qu'une conversation, à la suite de laquelle la demanderesse s'est efforcée de rejoindre l'ambassade.
[25]
Elle prétend donc que la SPR n'a pas compris la preuve ou qu'elle l'a mal interprétée. Encore une fois, elle insiste sur le fait qu'elle n'a reçu qu'un seul appel de l'ambassade, alors que la SPR mentionne de nombreux échanges. Il semble d'ailleurs que la demanderesse reproche à l'ambassade de ne pas avoir effectué de suivi après le 1er septembre 2009.
[26]
La demanderesse soutient que la SPR a mal interprété sa déclaration portant qu'elle espérait que le Canada lui viendrait en aide malgré l'annulation de son visa. D'après elle, cela ne signifie pas qu'elle savait que le visa avait été annulé avant son départ du Maroc. Cette déclaration a été faite après son arrivée au Canada et après qu'elle a découvert que le visa avait été annulé. Elle espérait simplement que les autorités canadiennes fassent preuve d'empathie à son égard.
[27]
Pour la demanderesse, [traduction] « [i] l est bien établi en droit que le tribunal est tenu de fournir des motifs clairs à l'appui de à sa décision » (paragraphe 99 du mémoire des arguments). À son avis, [traduction] « le fait que le tribunal n'ait pas fourni de motifs clairs est problématique. [...] Cela est selon nous contestable parce qu'en définitive, la demanderesse devrait être en mesure de comprendre pourquoi sa demande d'asile a été refusée à la lecture de la décision » (paragraphe 98 du mémoire des arguments).
[28]
Quant au défendeur, il signale que le tribunal inférieur qui évalue les faits et la preuve a droit à une grande déférence. Dans le cas présent, il estime qu'il était loisible à la SPR de tirer les conclusions auxquelles elle est parvenue compte tenu de la preuve dont elle disposait.
Analyse
[29]
La demanderesse soutient qu'il y a eu manquement à l'équité procédurale en l'espèce, parce que la SPR n'a pas analysé en détail le témoignage des trois témoins. Elle prétend qu'il s'agit d'un manquement à la justice naturelle, et elle invoque à l'appui de cet argument la décision
Via Rail
, précitée.
[30]
La difficulté tient à ce que la jurisprudence plus récente ne permet pas de retenir cet argument. Dans l'arrêt
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
], la Cour suprême a déclaré:
[16] Il se peut que les motifs ne fassent pas référence à tous les arguments, dispositions législatives, précédents ou autres détails que le juge siégeant en révision aurait voulu y lire, mais cela ne met pas en doute leur validité ni celle du résultat au terme de l'analyse du caractère raisonnable de la décision. Le décideur n'est pas tenu de tirer une conclusion explicite sur chaque élément constitutif du raisonnement, si subordonné soit-il, qui a mené à sa conclusion finale (
Union internationale des employés des services, local no 333 c. Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn.
, [1975] 1 R.C.S. 382, p. 391). En d'autres termes, les motifs répondent aux critères établis dans Dunsmuir s'ils permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables.
[31]
Dans l'affaire qui nous occupe, il ressort clairement des motifs de la SPR qu'elle n'avait pas besoin d'analyser les témoignages pour conclure que la demanderesse n'avait pas établi une crainte subjective. La Commission est réputée avoir tenu compte de tous les éléments de preuve, qu'elle en fasse expressément mention dans ses motifs ou non, à moins que le contraire ne soit démontré (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En l'occurrence, le fait de ne pas avoir examiné les témoignages qui n'étaient en fait que périphériques ne constitue pas un manquement à l'équité procédurale.
[32]
L'autre grande question soulevée par la demanderesse concerne la conclusion de la SPR quant à sa crédibilité, sur le fondement de laquelle elle a statué que la demanderesse n'avait pas établi une crainte subjective. Les parties conviennent que la norme de contrôle applicable à cet égard est celle de la décision raisonnable. Je suis d'accord.
[33]
Pour ce qui est du défaut d'avoir établi une crainte subjective, la demanderesse invoque encore une fois des décisions qui étaient à l'époque où elles ont été rendues d'emblée assujetties au contrôle judiciaire en raison de l'insuffisance des motifs fournis. L'état du droit a changé depuis que la jurisprudence favorable à cet argument a été rendue. Dans
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, précité, la Cour suprême du Canada a été on ne peut plus claire:
[14] Je ne suis pas d'avis que, considéré dans son ensemble, l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> signifie que l' « insuffisance » des motifs permet à elle seule de casser une décision, ou que les cours de révision doivent effectuer deux analyses distinctes, l'une portant sur les motifs et l'autre, sur le résultat (Donald J. M. Brown et John M. Evans,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada
(feuilles mobiles), §§12:5330 et 12:5510). Il s'agit d'un exercice plus global: les motifs doivent être examinés en corrélation avec le résultat et ils doivent permettre de savoir si ce dernier fait partie des issues possibles. Il me semble que c'est ce que la Cour voulait dire dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> en invitant les cours de révision à se demander si « la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité » (par. 47).
En l'espèce, il m'est difficile de conclure que l'issue à laquelle la SPR est parvenue n'est pas raisonnable. On comprend bien pourquoi elle est arrivée à la conclusion à laquelle elle est parvenue et la SPR s'appuie d'ailleurs sur une évaluation adéquate de l'ensemble de la preuve.
[34]
La demanderesse a choisi de venir au Canada le 29 septembre 2010 bien qu'elle ait reçu au moins un appel téléphonique de la part de l'ambassade canadienne au Maroc. À mon avis, la question de savoir s'il y a eu ou non plusieurs tentatives de communication n'est qu'un faux-fuyant au vu d'un examen approprié de l'ensemble de la preuve. La demanderesse a vu celui qui était alors son mari pour la dernière fois au printemps de 2010, et à ce moment il avait déjà communiqué avec les autorités canadiennes pour les informer qu'il ne souhaitait plus parrainer sa femme parce que le couple était en instance de divorce. Ce serait faire preuve d'une trop grande naïveté que d'accepter, en de pareilles circonstances, que la demanderesse, sans même avoir contacté son mari au Canada, prendrait un avion à destination de Montréal et demanderait immédiatement l'asile à son arrivée après avoir été informée que son visa avait été annulé.
[35]
Je pense qu'il était raisonnable de la part de la Commission de conclure que la demanderesse en fait a saisi l'occasion qui se présentait à elle de quitter le Maroc. À mon avis, la Commission a raisonnablement conclu que la demanderesse a révélé qu'elle savait que son visa avait été annulé. Il est également compréhensible, eu égard aux circonstances dans lesquelles la demanderesse a quitté son pays, que la SPR se soit demandé pourquoi elle l'avait fait malgré les violences physiques et psychologiques infligées par son mari durant les trente-cinq jours qu'ils avaient passés ensemble.
[36]
Au fond, la Commission n'a pas cru qu'une personne physiquement et psychologiquement maltraitée par un conjoint, qu'elle n'avait pas vu depuis cinq mois, quitterait le Maroc pour le rejoindre en dépit d'une communication de l'ambassade du Canada donnant à tout le moins à penser qu'il y avait un problème avec sa demande. Il est invraisemblable qu'elle n'ait pas cherché à joindre son mari après qu'il eut entamé les procédures de divorce et communiqué avec les autorités canadiennes. Plus bizarre encore, la demanderesse n'aurait pas contacté son époux qui la parrainait pendant la période de vingt-huit jours qui s'est écoulée entre l'appel de l'ambassade et son départ pour le Canada. Cela semble être de l'aveuglement volontaire. Je crois qu'il était très raisonnable que la SPR conclue que les raisons à l'origine de la démarche de la demanderesse n'étaient pas celles qu'elle prétend. Il n'y a d'ailleurs rien de mal à vouloir une vie meilleure, mais cela ne donne pas droit au statut de réfugié ou de personne à protéger.
[37]
Il est également assez compréhensible que la SPR n'ait pas prêté foi à la déclaration voulant que l'ex-mari pourrait la persécuter au Maroc alors qu'il n'a pas été établi qu'il l'avait fait au Canada, où il vit à moins de 500 kilomètres de son ex-femme. Non seulement il n'existe aucune preuve convaincante à cet effet, mais rien n'explique ce qui pourrait le pousser à agir de la sorte. De même, la SPR a estimé que la preuve des problèmes psychiatriques du père de la demanderesse n'étayait pas l'existence d'une crainte subjective. Je suis d'accord. Quels qu'aient été les motifs de son mariage, il ne s'ensuit pas que la demanderesse à des raisons de craindre pour sa sécurité si elle retourne dans son pays de nationalité.
[38]
Par conséquent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée, et il n'y a aucune question à certifier.
