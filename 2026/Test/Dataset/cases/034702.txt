Introduction:
[1]
Teitelbaum, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a negative decision of a visa officer. On April 27, 1995, the applicant, Mr. Azarpajooh, made, without the assistance of counsel, an application for permanent residence in the Independent-Skilled Worker Category. The applicant stated in his application that his intended occupation was "Engineer in Construction" (p. 31, vol. 2, applicant's record). The applicant is a native of Iran and was interviewed by Alison Harvey, Second Secretary to the Canadian Embassy in Damascus, Syria (hereinafter the "visa officer") on November 28, 1995 in Tehran. The visa officer informed the applicant of the outcome of his application in a letter dated January 9, 1996, erroneously addressed to the applicant's wife, "Hashemipour Tafreshi", instead of the applicant. In the letter, received by the applicant on January 30 1996, the applicant was advised that his application could not be approved. The applicant lacked the requisite number of points to obtain a visa based on such factors as occupational demand in the assessed occupation of "Manager, Engineering" and experience in the alternate occupation of "Civil Engineer".
[2]
In 1981, the applicant began to work for the Transport Organization of the Municipality of Tehran with the title of "Managing Director". In 1987, the applicant started his own engineering consulting firm, "Rahpooyan Consulting Engineers" in which he employed other engineers. The visa officer assessed the applicant under the specific occupation of "Manager, Engineering" because the applicant had always been "employed in a managerial capacity" (p. 19, vol. 1, applicant's record). The applicant had the requisite
total
number of points for the occupation of Manager, Engineering based on such factors as experience and education. However, the applicant was also required to receive a minimum number of points under the factor of "occupational demand". Since the applicant received no points in this category, his application was refused. The visa officer did assess the applicant in the alternate occupation of "Civil Engineer". Unfortunately for the applicant, he was trapped in a proverbial "Catch-22". The visa officer determined that although the applicant had experience as a "Manager, Engineering", his "experience ha[d] been very limited" as an Civil Engineer. The visa officer did not provide a point tally or breakdown for the alternate occupation of "Civil Engineer".
[3]
After receipt of this negative decision, the applicant subsequently retained counsel. In a letter dated March 8, 1996, the applicant's counsel requested that the visa officer's decision in Mr. Azarpajooh's case be added to a review process already underway for four other decisions by the same visa officer regarding Iranian clients. Counsel for the applicant confirmed that the files remained open pending their review by the Deputy and Senior Programme Managers of the Immigration Section of the Canadian Embassy in Damascus (pp. 38-44, vol. 1, applicant's record). On March 18, 1996, the visa officer sent a revised letter, with apologies, to the applicant as the proper addressee (pp. 53-54, vol. 1, applicant's record). In all other respects, the letter was unchanged from the original January 9, 1996 letter. In a letter dated April 17, 1996, Mr. J. Hentschel, Senior Programme Manager, confirmed the visa officer's decision regarding the applicant's lack of hands-on experience as a Civil Engineer (pp. 26-28, vol. 1, applicant's record). Mr. Hentschel reiterated that the applicant has only worked in a supervisory role as a "Manager, Engineering". According to Mr. Hentschel, the visa officer's decision was "carefully considered" and appropriate.
[4]
The applicant submitted the application for judicial review on May 17, 1996 and sought the following relief: (i) an order for a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the Immigration Counsellors rendered on April 17, 1996; and (ii) an order of mandamus directing the respondent to process the applicant's application in a favourable manner. Alternatively, the applicant sought an order referring the matter to a different visa officer for redetermination. However, in his written submission, the applicant added an additional component to his alternative ground of relief and requested that the redetermination be heard not only by a different visa officer but also by a
different visa office,
the later at the choosing of the applicant (p. 80, vol. 1, applicant's record).
Parties' Submissions:
Applicant
[5]
The applicant alleges that the visa officer violated procedural fairness. The visa officer failed in her duty of fairness by not advising the applicant that he was going to be assessed under the category of "Manager, Engineering", an occupation for which he did not apply. As well, if the visa officer had doubts about the applicant's practical experience as a "Civil Engineer", the officer should have raised these doubts with the applicant during the course of the interview to give the applicant an opportunity to explain his work experience.
[6]
The applicant also submits that the visa officer committed an error of law in not looking to the totality of the evidence concerning his work experience as a "Civil Engineer". The visa officer erred in failing to provide the applicant with a fair and thorough assessment of his application. The actual work performed by the applicant during his employment is in no way included in the definition of "Manager, Engineering" used by visa officers to assess visa claimants.
Respondent
[7]
The respondent submits that the visa officer's notes speak for themselves on the subject of the applicant's practical experience as a Civil Engineer. The applicant has extensively relied on the visa officer's notes in his written submissions, but these very notes belie the applicant's assertions on the issue of the officer's ostensible failure to raise her doubts.
Grounds Of Review
1. Did The Visa Officer Violate
Procedural Fairness In Failing To
Raise Her Doubts About The
Applicant's Practical Experience?
Manager, Engineering As
The Assessed Occupation
[8]
The visa officer's notes are crucial to resolving the issue of whether the visa officer fulfilled her duty of fairness and raised her doubts about the applicant's practical experience. In her affidavit dated June 15, 1996, the visa officer explained the computerized note-taking process for interviews of visa claimants: "The interview notes are roughly in a question and answer format, the '--' indicating an answer after the question. There are several typos, as the notes are fixed in the record once the screen is closed" (para. 18, p. 4, respondent's record). In effect, the notes are akin to a transcript of the interview. The actual notes are succinct on the question of what the visa officer might have told the applicant regarding her doubts about his practical experience as a Civil Engineer. The applicant seemed to respond in a rather cryptic fashion.
"DOUBTS EXPRESSED, ALWAYS WORKED AS MGR. -- I USED TO TEACH IN THE UNIVERSITY. KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO, THEY RARELY GIVE SUCH A THING, TO GRANT LEAVE FROM MILITARY SERVICE. SAYS NO FAMILY CONNECTIONS TO GOVERNMENT." (p. 8, respondent's record)
[9]
The applicant argues that in the context of the applicant's response, "I used to teach in the university. Knew what I was going to do, they rarely give such a thing, to grant leave from military service" the phrase, "doubts expressed, always worked as mgr" is odd, disconnected to the surrounding text and almost a non sequitur. According to the applicant, this lends weight to the idea that the topic of doubts was in fact never expressly raised to the applicant but kept close to the visa officer's chest. However, the applicant has provided little authority for this sweeping argument based on inferences drawn from the context of the officer's notes. The applicant invokes the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that there is "no evidence as to what this phrase, 'doubts expressed, always worked as mgr' means or
whether it was ever put to the applicant
" (my emphasis) (para. 38, vol. 1, applicant's record). There are two distinct problems with this line of reasoning. First, the
Gill
case does not stand for the sweeping proposition argued by the applicant. In
Gill
, the applicant applied for a visitor's visa in a now closed category of Last Remaining Family. In order to qualify, he had to be unmarried. The applicant stated in an affidavit describing his interview with the visa officer that he had "denied" ever being married. Associate Chief Justice Jerome characterized
Gill
as an "extraordinary case" when he gave his reasons orally from the bench. He rejected at p. 306 of the decision the argument that use of the word "denial" in the applicant's affidavit meant that the topic of marriage had been "discussed extensively or that the visa officer must have confronted the applicant in some way with some evidence to the contrary or with some information to the contrary". In effect,
Gill
expands a question of semantics on the meaning of "denial". There is nothing in the case at bar that involves "denial".
[10]
Second, the visa officer in the case at bar is clear in her own affidavit that she did expressly and clearly raise her serious doubts (para. 6, respondent's record). In
Gill
, there is no reference to a corresponding affidavit from the visa officer involved, reason enough for why the meaning of the simple word "denial" in the applicant's own affidavit took on such significance. Given the clear and unequivocal statement from the visa officer herself in the case at bar, it would be unreasonable to rely on the tenuous inferences and arguments submitted by the applicant that the visa officer never expressed any doubts. Of course, there is an alternative interpretation of the applicant's garbled response that forestalls any need to invoke ostensible duplicity in the visa officer's note-taking. The notes reveal that the visa officer did disclose her qualms. In his response to the visa officer's expression of doubts, the applicant might have rambled a bit and confirmed to the visa officer that he had always aimed for a "higher", managerial position even from his university days. Because of his upwardly mobile goals, he was granted special dispensation and leave from military service. The visa officer's notes reveal that the applicant "started in 1981 military service,
done at the same time that worked in transportation."
(my emphasis) (p. 7, respondent's record). I am satisfied, however, from the reading of the visa officer's notes, that if she expressed her concerns she did not do so very forcibly.
[11]
Even more disturbing, is the issue of whether the visa officer specifically informed the applicant that he would be considered under the occupation of "Manager, Engineering", and if not, whether failure to do so, is a breach of procedural fairness. In his affidavit, the applicant has stated that he was "greatly surprised" to read that he had been slotted into the managerial role when this possibility had not been raised during the interview (para. 21, p. 8, vol. 1, applicant's record). The applicant is being a bit disingenuous on this point since the quotation from the visa officer's notes cited above indicates that the visa officer posed the question to the applicant that he had "always worked as mgr" [ie. manager]. The notes also reveal that the subject of the applicant's actual design experience came up on numerous occasions. There is no question, therefore, that the visa officer did make some disclosure of her doubts. However, does the law also require that the visa officer state to the applicant during the course of the interview, "I will assess you under this specific occupation"? Put differently, is the duty of fairness altered when the applicant has, as in the case at bar, not specified an intended occupation in his original application? The applicant's phrase on his original application in the space reserved for intended occupation was rather vague and amorphous, "Engineer in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 222 (T.D.) (hereinafter <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), Associate Chief Justice Jerome focused at p. 226 of his decision on the purpose of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 and the "right" of applicants to "frame their application in a way that maximizes their chances for entry". Conversely, it was therefore open to the visa officer to consider in what capacity, practical or supervisory, the applicant could work as "an Engineer in Construction" since the applicant himself had put no parameters on his intended employment. What remains an open question is whether the visa officer complied with the duty of fairness in being suitably
explicit
to the applicant on the particular occupation for which he was going to be assessed. Because the applicant was not specific in his application on his own intended occupation, the ball was effectively in the visa officer's court to slot the applicant into a specific occupation under the Canadian Classification Dictionary of Occupations (CCDO), the text incorporated by reference into the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978 SOR/78-172 that is used by visa officers to make their assessments. In her affidavit, the visa officer makes no mention that she directly put to the applicant her "determinat[ion] that the occupation which most closely matched his experience was that of Manager, Engineering (CCDO 1131 118) (para. 9, p. 2, respondent's record). The applicant alleges that at no point did he indicate to the visa officer that he wished to be employed as a Manager, Engineering.
[12]
The visa officer has a duty to reveal to the applicant what was in her mind so that the applicant could, if he desired, dispute the visa officer's finding and disabuse her of assumptions:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, the court granted judicial review because the visa officer did not give the applicant an opportunity to explain how his work experience related to more than one occupation. The respondent argues that the case at bar can be distinguished from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> because the applicant himself in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> had made representations that he met the definition of more than one occupation. In the case at bar, it would appear that the visa officer erred in failing to notify the applicant that he would be assessed under the occupation of Manager, Engineering. At the very least, she should have notified the applicant that he would be assessed under both headings.
2. Did The Visa Officer Err In
Assessing The Applicant's Work
Experience?
Standard Of Review
[13]
The standard of review is high in this type of proceeding:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There appears to be nothing remiss in the visa officer's method for assessing the applicant's experience. She fulfilled her duties in the exercise of her discretion. The visa officer questioned the applicant during the course of the interview about his specific functions and duties at each employment:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). There is therefore no merit to the applicant's assertion that the visa officer erred or failed to properly consider the evidence because her mind was clouded by his "managerial sounding title" (p. 80, vol. 1 applicant's record). It is apparent from the visa officer's notes that the applicant's involvement in design work was a constant theme throughout the interview. For instance, the applicant did not do design work in his capacity as Managing Director with the Municipality of Tehran. There is also nothing in the visa officer's notes to substantiate the applicant's claim that he did such work. Indeed, the notes state, "DID NOT DRAW MAPS HIMSELF, THE ENGINEERS WORKED FOR ME. AT MOST WOULD CHECK THEIR DWGS" (p. 4, vol. 2, applicant's record). However, the same notes do reveal that the applicant seemed to have more hands-on experience in his work at his own engineering consulting company. In response to the visa officer's question, "do any design work?", the applicant responded, "Bridges, part of airport, planning and design of extension of transit terminals and air bridges" (p. 7, respondent's record). On the topic of the applicant's current work project, the expansion of an air terminal, the visa officer again asked "who had done the design work?". The applicant responded, "
I have participated in this
, but there are other people involved" (my emphasis). Finally, the applicant was more concrete on his involvement in the design of a spaghetti junction, a project in limbo from the 1979 Revolution in Iran. The visa officer's notes state, "involved in design, calculated superelevation, changes with each CM. Computer programs not used" (p. 8, respondent's record).
[14]
There are therefore some suggestions in the visa officer's notes that the applicant was involved in design work. Why then did the visa officer fail to award the applicant any points for experience as a Civil Engineer? The court in this instance might reach a different conclusion than the visa officer on the question of the applicant's experience as a Civil Engineer. However, that is not the standard in cases of judicial review. The court should not intervene or substitute its own finding for the visa officer's without clear evidence of errors or arbitrary decision-making:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). Did the visa officer make an error of law in not awarding the applicant any points for experience as a Civil Engineer? In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, the court held that in any application the actual experience and time spent in each of the various responsibilities had to be broken down. Failure to do so constitutes an error of law. Associate Chief Justice Jerome also held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the record had to support the visa officer's assignment of a specific experience rating. In the case at bar, I am satisfied that the visa officer failed to break down the applicant's duties in his previous employment and award units of assessment for experience for his design work, particularly at his current position at the consulting firm. In her letter to the applicant dated January 9, 1996, the visa officer also did not acknowledge any possibility that the applicant had performed design work. She merely stated that his experience has "been very limited in this regard" (p. 37, vol. 1, applicant's record). This indicates to me that the decision of the visa officer is not reasonable.
[15]
I have no difficulty dismissing the applicant's submission concerning another alleged error. According to the applicant, the visa officer did not conclude that an individual qualified to be a "Manager, Engineering", someone supervising and overseeing the work of Civil Engineers, must by definition be qualified to do the work of a Civil Engineer. I disagree that this constitutes an error. The visa officer accepted the fact that the applicant had the academic credentials for writing the exams that could qualify him for eventual membership in the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers (para. 5, p. 2, respondent's record). And yet, the operative word is experience and not qualification. Column I of Schedule I of the
Immigration Regulations
creates a distinction between education and experience as separate and distinct factors for units of assessment. There is no necessary correlation between qualification in a field or occupation and actual experience.
Conclusion:
[16]
I am satisfied that the visa officer failed to provide procedural fairness in the circumstances of this case. The visa officer had the duty to clearly inform the applicant that he was only being fully considered under the category Manager, Engineering. The visa officer should have considered the applicant's design experience under the category Civil Engineer.
[17]
The decision of the visa officer is quashed and the matter is referred back to another visa officer at any immigration office other than the one in Damascus, Syria.
Application allowed.
