Teitelbaum, J.
: This is an appeal from an order of the Senior Prothonotary dated March 11, 1987, wherein the Senior Prothonotary struck out paragraphs 19 to 24 inclusively of the cross-demand made by the defendants, cross-plaintiffs.
[2]
The defendants, appellants, state, in their notice of appeal, that the Senior Prothonotary struck out the above mentioned paragraphs "au motif qu'ils ne révèlent aucune cause raisonnable d'action" and it is their submission he erred in arriving at this conclusion.
[3]
The defendants give five reasons in the notice of appeal as to why they believe the Senior Prothonotary erred.
[4]
The facts leading up to the present proceedings are the following:
[5]
The plaintiffs issued a statement of claim against the defendants asking, in its conclusions, for an interlocutory and permanent injunction against the defendants from dealing with a number of literary works which plaintiff Omega claims it is the owner of the copyright and that the plaintiff Quasimodo is the distributor and licensee.
[6]
Plaintiffs are claiming damages and loss of profits in addition to the injunction.
[7]
The defendants filed a statement of defence to plaintiffs' action together with a cross-demand.
[8]
In the cross-demand, the defendants, cross-plaintiffs ask for the following conclusions:
"24. Les demandeurs reconventionnels sont donc bien fondés en faits et en droit de réclamer et réclament:
a) des dommages-intérêts exemplaires pour l'atteinte à la réputation qu'ils ont subie et pour la baisse du chiffre d'affaires qui en a découlée;
Pour le demandeur reconventionnel, Michel King:
$50,000.00
Pour les demandeurs reconventionnels, Les Logiciels KLM Ltée et KLM Groupe Informatique Ltée:
$50,000.00
b) des dommages-intérêts punitifs pour atteinte à leurs droits fondamentaux et abus de procédures;
Pour le demandeur reconventionnel, Michel King:
$50,000.00
Pour les demandeurs reconventionnels, Les Logiciels KLM Ltée et KLM Groupe Informatique Ltée
$50,000.00"
[9]
Therefore the defendants, as cross-plaintiffs, are asking the Court to condemn the plaintiffs, cross-defendants, to pay exemplary and punitive damages as a result of the present claim against them.
[10]
After the filing of the statement of defence and cross-demand, plaintiffs served a motion, in virtue of rule 419(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules, on or about February 25, 1987, asking for the striking out of paragraphs 19 to 24 inclusively of the cross-demand "au motif qu'ils ne révèlent aucune cause raisonnable d'action".
[11]
The above motion was heard by the Senior Prothonotary on March 9, 1987. The Senior Prothonotary, on March 11, 1987, rendered the following order:
"Après avoir écouté l'argumentation des deux procureurs, lu les pièces au dossier, référé à la loi et la jurisprudence citée, cette requête est accordée au motif que cette Cour n'a pas juridiction en l'espèce."
[12]
The Senior Prothonotary maintained the motion because the Court does not have jurisdiction, not because "qu'ils ne révèlent aucune cause raisonnable d'action".
[13]
This decision is now under appeal.
[14]
In argument before me, counsel for the respondent informed me that he would limit his argument to the question of jurisdiction. I therefore take for granted that he is satisfied that if I come to the conclusion that the Federal Court has jurisdiction then the appeal should be maintained. He is not arguing that the cross-demand does not show a reasonable cause of action.
[15]
This being the issue, the first matter of law that I must decide is whether the question of jurisdiction of the Federal Court is raised by a motion under rule 419(1)(a) or whether it should be raised by following the procedure set out in rule 401. Rule 419(1)(a) presupposes that the Court has jurisdiction but that the pleading under attack shows "aucune cause raisonnable d'action".
[16]
Rule 419 states:
"419(1) The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or anything in any pleading to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be
(b) it is immaterial or redundant,
(c) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious,
(d) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action,
(e) it constitutes a departure from a previous pleading, or
(f) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court, and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly.
"419(2) No evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(a).
"419(3) In this rule 'departure' means that which is prohibited by rule 411."
[17]
There is no mention of
jurisdiction
of the Federal Court in the wording of this rule.
[18]
In looking at rule 401, it is clear that this rule was specifically set out to deal with the problem of the Federal Court's jurisdiction.
[19]
Rule 401 states:
"401. A defendant may, by leave of the Court, file a conditional appearance for the purpose of objecting to
(a) any irregularity in the commencement of the proceeding;
(b) the service of the statement of claim or declaration, or notice thereof, on him; or
(c)
the jurisdiction
of the Court, and an order granting such leave shall make provision for any stay of proceedings necessary to allow such objection to be raised and disposed of." (underlining is mine)
[20]
If it was meant that rule 419(1) (a) was to deal with the question of the Court's jurisdiction, why would rule 401 remain in its present form.
[21]
I am satisfied that it never was the intention to have two rules dealing with the question of the Court's jurisdiction. Rule 401 was meant to deal with questions of the Court's jurisdiction and rule 419(1)(a) was meant to deal with questions of whether the pleading shows a reasonable cause of action or defence, taking for granted that the matter under review is within the jurisdiction of the Court.
[22]
I am therefore satisfied that the Senior Prothonotary erred, from a procedural view, in finding that the Court has no jurisdiction in relation to the cross-demand filed by the cross-plaintiffs. He was not asked to make this type of decision.
[23]
Rule 2(2) of the Federal Court Rules states that a proceeding should not be defeated simply because of a procedural flaw.
[24]
Rule 2(2) states:
"2(2) These rules are intended to render effective the substantive law and to ensure that it is carried out; and they are to be so interpreted and applied as to facilitate rather than to delay or to end prematurely the normal advancement of cases."
[25]
I therefore am of the view that I should now decide if the Senior Prothonotary had reason to conclude that the Federal Court does not have jurisdiction for dealing with the cross-demand filed by the defendants, cross-plaintiffs.
[26]
I am satisfied that the Senior Prothonotary did not err in concluding that the Federal Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the claim for damages filed by the cross-plaintiffs.
[27]
The only argument submitted by counsel for defendants, cross-plaintiffs as to why he is of the belief that the Federal Court has jurisdiction is that it is clear to him that the cross-demand is so intimately related to the principal action that the cross-demand cannot exist by itself. Counsel states that the claim for damages by cross-plaintiffs is as a direct result of the action taken by the principal plaintiffs and thus must, of necessity, be judged together.
[28]
With respect to this argument, I cannot agree.
[29]
A cross-demand is a separate and distinct claim arising out of the same factual situation between the same parties. It is only a means of saving time and costs but is, nevertheless, a separate and distinct claim.
[30]
It is of interest to examine, in detail, the cross-plaintiffs' demand to attempt to see the basis for their claim to damages.
[31]
The principle reasons for the cross-demand can be found in paragraphs 22 and 23 of the cross-demand:
"22. Michel King, les Logiciels KLM Ltée et KLM Groupe Informatique Ltée ont subi de graves dommages suite à cette action instituée par les demandeurs, et;
(i) principalement quant à Michel King:
parce qu'il n'est lui-même aucunement partie aux actes reprochés aux co-défendeurs;
(ii) quant aux co-demandeurs reconventionnels, Les Logiciels KLM Ltée et KLM Groupe Informatique Ltée:
parce qu'ils ont fait les achats et ventes sans se soustraire aux autorisations des compagnies distributrices;
"23. Suite à cette action, la réputation d'homme d'affaires honnête et intègre de Michel King ainsi que la réputation et le prestige des co demandeurs reconventionnels Les Logiciels KLM Ltée et KLM Groupe Informatique Ltée s'en trouvent gravement ébranlés et ils ont subi un préjudice énorme."
[32]
It therefore would seem that the entire basis of the cross-demand by cross-plaintiffs is one of a question of reputation. Damage to cross-plaintiffs' reputation caused as a result of legal proceedings instituted by plaintiffs for alleged breach of the plaintiffs' copyright.
[33]
It is not necessary for me to decide whether or not the cross-plaintiffs would be entitled to any damages assuming their defence was well founded.
[34]
There is no doubt that the Federal Court has jurisdiction with regard to the principal action involving copyright and the question of damages that plaintiffs would be entitled to if judgment is obtained in their favour.
[35]
The decision of Mr. Justice Hugessen in the case of Roy Anthony Roberts et al. (plaintiffs/respondents) and Her Majesty the Queen et al. (defendants/appellants) (unreported) F.C.A. A-585-86, March 2, 1987, clearly states the test to be applied in attempting to answer the question of the Court's jurisdiction.
[36]
At pages 2 and 3, Mr. Justice Hugessen states:
"Notwithstanding the quantities of judicial ink that have been expended on the question of this court's jurisdiction, I am relieved of a detailed study of all the jurisprudence by the most recent decision of the Supreme Court on the matter in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, McIntyre, J., speaking for the majority, gave what, I may say with respect, was a clear and helpful synthesis of the state of the law. He said:
'The general extent of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court has been the subject of much judicial consideration in recent years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the essential requirements to support a finding of jurisdiction in the Federal Court were established. They are:
1. There must be a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament.
2. There must be an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction.
3. The law on which the case is based must be "a law of Canada" as the phrase is used in s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867.'"
[37]
Cross-plaintiffs' demand must fail by simply applying the first test, that is, there must be a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament.
[38]
Damages to one's reputation being claimed by persons against other persons and where there is no involvement of the Crown is a matter to be brought before the proper Court in the province where the claim may be made, not the Federal Court of Canada.
[39]
In speaking of the matter being intertwined or so closely related, Mr. Justice Hugessen goes on to state at pages 4 and 5 of the Robert case (supra):
"The real problem raised by the present appeal has to do with McIntyre, J.'s, first requirement namely, that there be a statutory grant of jurisdiction to the Federal Court. It is, of course, trite that this court, as a creature of statute, can have no jurisdiction beyond what statute specifically confers.
"Joyal, J., in the Trial Division, found the necessary statutory jurisdiction in the words of section 17(1) of the Federal Court Act, the applicable part of which reads as follows:
'17(1) The Trial Division has original jurisdiction in all cases where relief is claimed against the Crown ...'
"In this respect he followed two earlier decisions of Reed, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the claims of the plaintiff band against the Crown and against the defendant band were so 'intertwined' with one another as to make it appropriate for jurisdiction over the defendant band to follow jurisdiction over the Crown.
"I confess that this approach gives me some difficulty. It is, of course, perfectly true that on a literal reading the words of section 17(1) lend themselves to the interpretation that, once relief is claimed against the Crown, the whole case falls within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court even though it may include claims for the same or other relief against one or more other defendants which would not otherwise be cognisable in this court. That, however, is not an interpretation which has hitherto found favour. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)."
[40]
I am satisfied that the cross-demand is based on a claim for damages to reputation that the Federal Court does not have the statutory power to decide notwithstanding its relationship with the principal claim of the plaintiffs.
[41]
In that I have stated that the motion made by plaintiffs under rule 419(1)(a) was the wrong procedure to raise the question of jurisdiction, I am not awarding the plaintiffs-respondents any costs in the present appeal. The order of the Senior Prothonotary does not speak of costs so none are awarded for the hearing before him.
[42]
The appeal is dismissed without costs.
Appeal dismissed.
