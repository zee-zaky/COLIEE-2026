Pinard, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Board") dated April 17, 2003, wherein the Board found that the applicant is not a Convention refugee or a "person in need of protection" as defined in sections 96 and 97 respectively of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.
[2]
The applicant is a citizen of Pakistan. He alleges a well-founded fear of persecution because of his activities in the Shia Muslim community and he claims to face a reasonable chance of serious harm in Pakistan.
[3]
The Board found that the applicant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The Board concluded that state protection is available to the applicant and that the latter did not have the profile of a person at risk in Pakistan.
[4]
This Court cannot substitute its opinion for that of the Board unless the applicant can demonstrate that the Board's decision was based on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a capricious manner or without regard for the material before it (subsection 18.1(4) of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7). The Board must also be presumed to have considered all of the evidence that was presented to it, and the tribunal is not obliged to mention in its reasons all the evidence it has taken into account before rendering its decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL)).
[5]
In the case at bar, I agree with the respondent's argument that the applicant's submissions pertain to the manner in which the Board weighed the evidence on the issue of state protection. It is not the role of this Court to re-weigh and re-assess all of the documentary evidence and substitute its own conclusions. The Board, as a specialized tribunal, is better equipped to evaluate and weigh the totality of the evidence presented to it and, in this case, the Board was entitled to prefer the documentary evidence to the applicant's testimony ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL)).
[6]
According to the applicant, the Board erred in finding that state protection was available to him. There is a general presumption that the state is able to provide protection to its citizens and the applicant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to do so ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 724). The applicant has not demonstrated with clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable to protect him. The applicant also submits that in assessing the availability of state protection, the Board improperly relied on an extrinsic televised report. According to the applicant, this use of extrinsic evidence is contrary to the dictates of natural justice and the Board ought to have afforded the applicant an opportunity to address the evidence. I agree with the respondent that this argument does not raise a serious issue. The report upon which the Board relied did not present novel information unknown to the applicant and, therefore, the Board was not required to communicate this information to him. Furthermore, the Board also relied on ample documentary evidence to conclude that state protection was available to the applicant (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (QL)).
[7]
A thorough review of the file reveals that the Board's decision in this case was reasonable and contains no reviewable error. Consequently, the application for judicial review is dismissed.
