Wetston, J.
: The plaintiff, Almecon Industries Limited ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), alleges that the defendant, Nutron Manufacturing Ltd. ("Nutron"), is infringing Canadian patent No. 1,220,134 (the "Almecon patent"), which was issued on April 4, 1987. The patent relates to a topping and tamping plug for use in the seismic exploration industry. The defendant manufactures and sells topping and tamping plugs in competition with the plaintiff. The defendant denies that its product infringes the Almecon patent, and argues that the Almecon patent is, for numerous reasons, invalid. A counterclaim by the defendant was withdrawn at trial.
Topping And Tamping Plugs
[2]
In the seismic industry, an area is identified for exploration when it is thought to contain sedimentary basins where oil and gas pools might be found. Generally, bore holes are drilled, loaded with explosive charges, and then detonated (or shot). Measurements are recorded for the purpose of studying the geologic formations. Unless a bore hole is properly tamped, a large portion of the energy of the shot can escape. A tamping plug must therefore be sufficiently durable to withstand the force of the shot without disintegrating, and to remain in place in the hole during and after the shot.
[3]
The parties agree that a tamping and topping plug is a seismic plug which is inserted in a bore hole prior to detonation of a seismic charge, and which is expected to remain in the hole during and after detonation of the charge in order to perform a tamping function. The tamping and topping plug must also fit sufficiently firmly in the hole so as to support a column of topping material, intended to prevent erosion and to avoid the danger of open bore holes. Given the purposes of a topping and tamping plug, blowouts during detonation result in increased costs to reclose the hole, the production of unwanted debris, and the generation of unreliable measurements. Plugs that twist or tilt in the bore hole are also undesirable. Almecon and Nutron have each manufactured various topping and tamping plugs. Almecon has generally sold its plugs under the name "King Plug", while the alleged infringing plugs of the defendant are called "Super Grip" plugs.
[4]
Prior to 1984, topping and tamping plugs were primarily fan-shaped with either a cylindrical or tapered body with a slitted flange, or a central body with single, flexible wings radiating therefrom. The flange or wings of these plugs generally extend at a right angle from the body of each plug. Examples of such plugs include the Ovelson/Nutron Perma Plug and Auger Plug, and Nutron's Perma Seal and Flex Seal, all of which were embodied in Canadian patent No. 920,508, as well as the Bassani Tiger Paw plug, which was disclosed in Canadian patent No. 1,048,405. These plugs were not ideal tamping devices, as they were frequently blown out of the bore holes, or became misaligned during the shot. (See Appendix "A" for a diagrammatical representation of a number of the topping and tamping plugs introduced at trial.)
The Almecon Patent And The King Plug
[5]
The plaintiff owns the Almecon patent, which names Paavo Luoma and Jim Jackson as inventors. It teaches a tamping and topping plug, of moulded, one-piece construction, to be used in seismic bore holes. The preferred embodiment of the Almecon patent, which is the King Plug, consists of a body member from which extend two rows of claw-like members.
[6]
In developing the Almecon King Plug, Mr. Luoma collaborated with his partner, Jim Jackson, whom he first met in the spring of 1984. Previously, Mr. Jackson had developed a device made of foam which was used to plug water holes that were created during the drilling of Artesian wells. In 1984, Mr. Jackson was working on a smaller version of the Artesian well plug, to be used as a topping and tamping plug in seismic bore holes. Although it was intended to prevent blow-outs, this plug had a tendency to tilt in the bore hole. Mr. Luoma's design work took place during the summer of 1984, and culminated in the completion of drawings, by August of 1984, that depicted how the King Plug would work.
[7]
As a mechanical engineer, Mr. Luoma recognized that most seismic drilling takes place in soil that is loose and soft. He realized that Mr. Jackson's foam plug could be made more effective if the force of the shot could be used to stop the plug from moving, rather than causing it to move, as was the case with the foam plug. Since Mr. Luoma intended the King Plug to have both a topping and a tamping function, he eventually conceived of the idea that the plug could set itself into the walls of the bore hole through the action of claws. He first thought that the addition of a single claw would allow the plug to jam into the bore hole walls. This did not prevent blowouts, however, so Mr. Luoma added a second claw; this, too, was not entirely successful.
[8]
Eventually, Mr. Luoma arrived at the design of the present Almecon King Plug. In contrast with the earlier foam plug, the King Plug is made from moulded plastic that is designed to ensure that the plug remains axially stable in the bore hole, without tilting relative to the longitudinal axis of the hole. Maintaining alignment in the bore hole prevents the blast debris from escaping up the bore hole, and also prevents the plug from turning sideways in the hole. In addition, axial alignment ensures that more of the plug's elongated members become embedded in the side walls of the bore hole, thereby creating more resistance to the blast forces, and producing a stronger topping plug so that the bore hole will not reopen. In order to perform its tamping function, the end portion of the plug is substantially closed, and the body member is intended to fit snugly into the bore hole. (See Appendix "B" for a diagram of the preferred embodiment of the plug described in the Almecon patent.)
[9]
When introduced into the market in the winter of 1984-1985, the Almecon King Plug was an immediate success. A number of seismic crews instantly began to use the King Plug, despite their longstanding use of other plugs. Almecon sold approximately 240,000 plugs during its first winter drilling season. On January 25, 1985, the plaintiff applied for its patent; the patent was issued on April 7, 1987.
[10]
The plaintiff provided the court with a very specific account of the steps which led to the development of its King Plug. As the evidence indicates, Mr. Luoma prepared a diagram of the King Plug on August 16, 1984. By September 21, 1984, Almecon had produced the first design mould for its King Plug. On October 30 of the same year, Teledyne tested twenty of the plaintiff's King Plugs in the field, with extremely favourable results. Commercial production of the Almecon King Plug was underway by the end of October 1984.
The Super Grip Plug
[11]
The parties agree that the defendant's Super Grip plugs are topping and tamping plugs, each of which has a body member with a rearward end; a forward end that terminates in a somewhat-flattened end part; and a plurality of elongated members extending outwardly and rearwardly from at least one end of the body member. Like the Almecon King Plug, the Super Grip product also met with immediate acceptance in the seismic industry. According to Mr. Martin and Mr. Hobson, two of the defendant's witnesses, the Super Grip plug is, by a significant amount, Nutron's best-selling seismic plug.
[12]
Prior to the relevant time period of October 1984 to January 1985, Nutron and its predecessor company had already been involved in the business of manufacturing and selling seismic plugs for more than a decade. The evidence which the defendant provided in relation to the evolution of the Super Grip plug, however, was somewhat imprecise.
[13]
There is no doubt that there were pressures in the seismic industry in 1984 to create a better seismic plug. While the plaintiff contends that it entered the seismic plug market in order to manufacture a plug which would resist blow-outs, the defendant asserts that it wanted to modify its line of seismic plugs in order to develop a plug for easier insertion into the bore hole. It is clear that Nutron began to work on improvements to its evolving line of seismic plugs during the period when Almecon was creating its King Plug. By the end of October 1984, however, Nutron's seismic plugs had undergone a dramatic design change from the fan-shaped Flex Seal and Perma Seal designs, to the prototype of the Super Grip plug at issue in this trial. The defendant contends that this change in design was not in any way related to the appearance on the market of the Almecon King Plug.
[14]
The defendant's Super Grip prototype, which consisted of a body member with outwardly and rearwardly-extending members, also underwent numerous modifications. In November 1984, for example, the defendant shipped 500 of its Ezee Perma Seal plug, which was an unsuccessful version of the Super Grip plug. By this time, however, Almecon had already begun to manufacture and sell its commercially-successful King Plug.
Issues
1. What is the construction of claims 1 and 5 of the Almecon patent?
2. Is the Almecon patent invalid by reason of anticipation, obviousness, overbreadth, or ambiguity?
3. Does the Nutron Super Grip plug which was sold after April 7, 1987, infringe claims 1 and 5 of the Almecon patent?
Analysis
1. What Is The Construction Of Claims
1 And 5 Of The Almecon Patent?
[15]
There is no dispute between the parties as to the applicable law. The court should take a purposive approach to interpreting the claims, not one which is unduly technical or literal: per Lord Diplock in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1982] R.P.C. 183 (H.L.), at pages 65-66. The patent must be construed by a mind willing to understand, and seeking a construction that is reasonable and fair both to the patentee and to the public:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 3 N.R. 553, at pages 563 and 559-560 S.C.R. If the words of a claim are clear, it is necessary to look no further to discover the nature of an invention; otherwise, resort may be had to the disclosure for assistance in comprehending the meaning of words used in the claims:
Unilever plc v. Procter & Gamble Inc.
(1995), 184 N.R. 378 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1 (F.C.A.).
[16]
While the construction of the claims of a patent is a question of law for the court, it should be undertaken with a knowledge of the person skilled in the art, to the extent that such knowledge is revealed by the expert evidence accepted at trial:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the plaintiff suggested that persons skilled in the art might include a variety of individuals, it would not include a hardrock-mining engineer or a person without any interest in softrock seismic exploration. The plaintiff asserted that the notional person skilled in the art would be the supervisor of a seismic bore hole drilling crew. The defendant, on the other hand, described the appropriate skilled worker to be an experienced seismic plug manufacturer.
[18]
While seismic exploration may be carried out for a number of reasons, its principal purpose in the present case is to aid in the discovery of oil and gas deposits. Typically, seismic exploration involves a number of different areas of expertise. Although geologists are employed by the oil and gas companies, the actual field work is carried out by a seismic exploration crew. A crew is often employed by a geophysical contracting company that has been hired by the oil exploration business. The geophysical company may also subcontract a part of this work. An explosives company, for example, may supply the persons to load the bore hole with explosives. After considering all of the evidence, and the submissions of counsel, I find that the person skilled in the art to which the Almecon invention relates is an experienced seismic crew technician.
[19]
In the present case, only claims 1 and 5 of the Almecon patent are at issue. These claims state as follows:
"1. A tamping and topping plug for use in a seismic bore hole, and comprising:
a body member having a forward and a rearward end and terminating at its forward end with a somewhat flattened end part;
a plurality of elongated members extending outwardly and rearwardly from at least one end of the said body member, said members so arranged as to give said plug axial stability when inserted into a bore hole.
"5. The plug of claim 1 in which the configuration of the said end part is a truncated cone."
Together, these claims effectively describe the invention embodied within the Almecon patent. The King Plug in evidence in this trial represents the preferred embodiment, i.e., its elongated members extend from both the forward and rearward ends of the body.
[20]
While both parties in the case relied on experts, neither expert witness had specific experience regarding the design and manufacture of topping and tamping plugs. Mr. Anderson, for the plaintiff, is a Mechanical Engineer, who, as a consultant and inventor, has been involved in the development of products, and the patenting of systems and processes for use in the oil industry. Dr. Hamre, for the defendant, is a Metallurgical Engineer with expertise in the area of material failures and accidents. Mr. Anderson and Dr. Hamre both offered their expert opinions in relation to the construction of the patent in suit. Nevertheless, while their opinions are of assistance, it is my responsibility to be the final interpreter of the claims at issue.
Claim 1
[21]
The plug described in claim 1 of the Almecon patent (the "Almecon plug") consists of a body member with outwardly and rearwardly-extending elongated members. The plug has a body member to carry out the functions of tamping the blast in the bore hole, and topping the hole. The elongated members cannot themselves accomplish the plugging function; therefore, the body member, as a three-dimensional structure with distinct ends and a significant linear dimension, carries out the function of plugging the bore hole. In order to ensure a snug fit, the diameter of the body member must be close to, but somewhat less than, the inner diameter of the bore hole.
[22]
The Almecon plug's forward end terminates in a "somewhat flattened end part". In my view, this means that the forward end of the plug's body member is substantially closed, and has a surface area which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body member, so as to intercept the pressure wave resulting from the detonation of the charge. If the somewhat-flattened end part were not substantially closed, the force of the blast would be incapable of moving the plug slightly upward in the bore hole so that its elongated members could embed in the walls of the hole, as required by the Almecon patent.
[23]
The Almecon plug comprises a plurality of elongated members that extend outwardly and rearwardly from the body member. I interpret this to mean that two or more members, each of which has a linear dimension that is greater than its width, form part of the plug; yet, each elongated member is distinct from the body member. The elongated members extend away from the body member at an angle, in the direction of the plug's rearward end. The tips of the elongated members therefore describe a diameter which is greater than that of the body member. In its preferred embodiment, the Almecon plug consists of two sets of elongated members: one set extends from the forward end of the plug, and the other set extends from the rearward end.
[24]
The Almecon patent, as a whole, makes it clear that the elongated members are designed so that they are capable of acting as claws that set into the walls of the bore hole during the shot. It is also clear that the invention is not limited to the preferred embodiment, the King Plug, as the Almecon patent states that the elongated members extend from the forward end, or the rearward end, or both.
[25]
In claim 1 of the Almecon patent, the phrase "axial stability when inserted into a bore hole" is used. This means that the plug will remain aligned upon insertion, and will not become misaligned or tilted in the bore hole. Common sense also necessitates an interpretation that axial stability is intended to be maintained after the shot. In cross-examination, Dr. Hamre agreed that axial stability could be equated with the phrase "directional stability". In his view, the two sets of elongated members ensure that the King Plug, when inserted into the bore hole, does not become misaligned. Moreover, during the force of the blast, the King Plug maintains its axial stability, thereby allowing its claws to embed into the soil so that its body member can plug the hole. No device or tool, such as a stinger pole, is required in order to achieve this axial stability. A stinger pole is a tapered, spike-like device which is a standard tool for use in seismic exploration. It is used to tamp seismic plugs into position in the bore hole.
[26]
Claim 1 teaches that "said members" are "so arranged as to give said plug axial stability". There is considerable difference of opinion between the parties as to the meaning of the phrase "said members". The plaintiff contends that the axial stability is provided by the interrelationship of the elongated members and the body member. In contrast, the defendant asserts that the Almecon plug's axial stability is provided solely by the arrangement of the elongated members, irrespective of the body member. In other words, the defendant claims that "said members" refers only to the claws, not the body member.
[27]
According to Dr. Hamre, if "said members" is interpreted to mean only the claws, and not the body member, the plug would still exhibit a degree of axial stability. In his view, perfect axial stability need not be achieved. It is sufficient if the degree of axial stability exhibited by the plug will permit the plug to move upwards during the blast so that its elongated members will embed into the soil. With respect to the Almecon plug, though, Dr. Hamre indicated that the plug's stability is achieved through the interaction of both the body member and the elongated members. As Dr. Hamre explained, the body member of the Almecon plug interacts frictionally with the walls of the bore hole, while the elongated members embed into the soil.
[28]
Mr. Luoma also testified that the Almecon plug depends upon the elongated members of the plug embedding into the bore hole walls in order to stabilize the plug. According to Mr. Luoma, the pressures of the shot blast are transferred to the cylindrical body member of the plug, which intercepts the force and then transmits the force through the elongated members and into the soil. This interrelationship provides the plug with axial stability.
[29]
I have carefully considered the wording in claim 1 of the Almecon patent. Moreover, I have examined claim 1 in the context of the expert evidence at trial. I am satisfied that a purposive construction of claim 1 results in a conclusion that "said members" refers to the body member and the elongated members, and not the elongated members alone.
Claim 5
[30]
Claim 5 of the Almecon patent indicates that the somewhat-flattened end part of the plug is configured in the shape of a truncated cone. It is reasonable to conclude that this refers to a conical section with the pointed end removed. The Almecon patent makes it clear that this cone-shaped section is adjoined to, but distinct from, the cylindrical body member of the plug. Moreover, "truncated" means that the plug does not end in a pointed tip. As discussed above, the Almecon plug terminates in a flattened end portion. I have interpreted this to mean that a flat surface closes off the forward end of the body of the plug. Since the plug terminates at the forward end in both a flattened end portion and a truncated cone, I interpret claim 5 to mean that the pointed tip of the conical end section has been replaced by a flat surface which is substantially or completely closed.
[31]
The Almecon patent also states that the plug's forward end section may be profiled in a number of different configurations other than a truncated cone, including hemispherical and pyramidal. Therefore, a variation in the shape of the closed end section is within the claims of the patent.
[32]
Accordingly, I conclude that the invention embodied in the claims of the Almecon patent teaches the following:
(1) the plug has a body;
(2) the body has claws which extend outwards and rearwards;
(3) the claws and the body provide axial stability;
(4) the end of the plug is somewhat flattened; and,
(5) the plug has a truncated cone consisting of a conical section with the pointed end removed and replaced by a flat surface.
2. Is The Almecon Patent Invalid By
Reason Of Anticipation, Obviousness,
Overbreadth, Or Ambiguity?
[33]
According to ss. 45 and 46 of the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, an issued, subsisting Canadian patent is, absent evidence to the contrary, presumed to be valid during its full term of seventeen years from the date of issue. A party attacking the patent must satisfy the court, on a balance of probabilities, that the patent is invalid:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  invalid on the basis of anticipation, obviousness, overbreadth of claims 1 and 5, and ambiguity.
Anticipation
[35]
Section 27(1) of the
Patent Act
, supra, ensures that a patent will only be valid where it describes a novel invention that has not previously been anticipated by prior inventions. The defences of prior knowledge, prior use, prior publication, and prior sale are together referred to as "anticipation":
per
Decary, J., in
Diversified Products Corp. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 350 (F.C.A.), at page 360. In order to invalidate a patent for lack of novelty, an alleged prior disclosure must give information that, for purposes of practical utility, is equal to that given by the patent in suit, or will inevitably result in something within the claims:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Eng. C.A.), at page 485.
[36]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 (T.D.), Teitelbaum, J., noted that an analysis of anticipation involves a twofold test. Firstly, the court must consider whether the prior disclosure gives clear and unmistakable directions which would, in every case and without possibility of error, lead a skilled person to arrive at what is covered by the claims of the patent in suit. In other words, in light of the prior patent, was it inevitable that a skilled person would be led to discover the patent in suit?
[37]
If the first question is answered in the affirmative, the court must then ask if the prior patent conveys enough information which, for practical purposes, would be sufficient for the skilled person to know how to make the claimed invention without the exercise of any inventive skill. This is the enabling disclosure test. Thus, in order to satisfy the tests of anticipation, one has to show that the prior patent inevitably discloses an infringing device, and that the prior patent has enough description to enable the skilled person to construct the invention and put it to its proper use:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 8 C.P.R.(3d) 289 (F.C.A.), at page 297;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at page 238, affirmed (1987), 81 N.R. 382; 18 C.P.R.(3d) 1 (F.C.A.); and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  anticipated by a number of prior art patents and plugs which describe or embody the subject matter of the Almecon patent, and which were publicly available more than two years before the filing date of the Almecon patent application. The parties agree that the court must determine whether, in light of the common general knowledge possessed by a person skilled in the art in 1984, claim 1 or claim 5 of the Almecon patent has been anticipated by any of the following patents: Canadian patent No. 920,508, granted to Kenneth V. Ovelson in 1973 (the "Ovelson patent"); Canadian patent No. 1,049,405, granted to Peppino Bassani in 1979 (the "Bassani patent"); and French patent No. 977,180, granted to L'Air Liquide in 1950 (the "French patent").
[39]
There are a number of prior art industry products which must also be considered. In this regard, the parties agree that the court should ascertain whether claim 1 or claim 5 of the Almecon patent was anticipated by the manufacture, sale, and use in the seismic industry of any of the following plugs:
a. the Ovelson/Nutron Perma Plug, sold and used in Canada since 1971;
b. the Ovelson/Nutron Auger Plug, sold and used in Canada since 1975;
c. the Nutron Perma Seal plug, sold and used in Canada since 1980;
d. the Nutron Flex Seal plug, sold and used in Canada since 1982;
e. the Bassani Tiger Paw plug, sold and used in Canada prior to January 25, 1983, by Peppino Bassani or companies associated with him.
The Ovelson patent covers the embodiments of the Perma Plug, the Auger Plug, the Perma Seal, and the Flex Seal. The Bassani patent discloses the Tiger Paw plug. There was no evidence that the plug embodying the invention described in the French patent has ever been produced or manufactured for sale. In this regard, I recognize that an attempt to invalidate a patent solely by paper anticipation (i.e., a patent or article describing a device that has not been put into production) has been looked upon with disfavour:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 417 (T.D.), at page 430; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.).
[40]
The parties also agree on the following state of common general knowledge in the seismic industry at the alleged date of the invention:
a. seismic bore holes were typically 5" or 3½" in diameter, and 30-60 feet deep, but with variations outside that range depending on conditions;
b. seismic bore hole plugs were required by Alberta Regulations to be placed approximately 18" below ground;
c. seismic bore hole plugs were commonly made of plastic;
d. plastic drive points/power points were routinely used on the down hole dynamite charges;
e. seismic dynamite charges were routinely placed at the bottom of the hole, with drill cuttings placed on top of the charge; and,
f. seismic bore hole plugs were in most cases inserted near the top of the hole, prior to detonation of the charge, in accordance with the Regulations.
This information is relevant to a consideration of both anticipation and obviousness.
[41]
The Ovelson and Bassani patents disclose plugs which are all very similar. In fact, both patents describe plugs with generally fan-shaped configurations.
[42]
The Ovelson patent illustrates one form of topping plug for use subsequent to drilling and shooting in a seismic bore hole. The device consists of a tapered body with a flanged, annular rim at right angles to the body section. The wings of the rim may be flexed away from the body section, thereby providing limited diametrical size adjustment. The Ovelson patent discloses a topping plug only, which is to be placed in the seismic bore hole after the shot has taken place. It does not teach a plug to be inserted into the bore hole prior to detonation. It does, however, teach a topping plug which requires a stinger pole to facilitate installation into the bore hole. The Ovelson patent indicates that the plug remains in place in the bore hole through the operation of frictional engagement. Furthermore, the patent discloses that the plug is placed in an axially-stable position when its wings are bent rearwards, toward the opening of the bore hole.
[43]
Similarly, the Bassani patent discloses a form of hole-plugging device for use as a topping plug in seismic bore holes. It is clear from the Bassani patent that the product described therein is solely a topping plug, and performs no tamping function. The design of the plug is similar to that described in the Ovelson patent. The Bassani patent describes a topping plug with wings that display "gripping points" which engage the surface of the seismic bore hole. According to the patent, these gripping points stabilize the plug in the bore hole when it is carrying out its topping function.
[44]
Neither the Ovelson patent nor the Bassani patent discloses or embodies rearwardly-extending elongated members, as contained in the Almecon patent. In the Ovelson patent, though, the capacity of the flange to open up is considered. As indicated in the patent, where the diameter of the plug itself may not be sufficient to plug the hole, the wings of the plug can relax and open to fill the hole. However, these wings are not intended to serve a gripping or embedding function. Upon a fair reading of the Ovelson patent, then, it is not obvious that the plug's body must be the same diameter as the bore hole. If the relaxed wings of the Ovelson plug can serve part of the hole-plugging function, it is clear that the body of the plug need not always fit snugly within the diameter of the bore hole, as required by the Almecon patent.
[45]
In addition, the Ovelson and Bassani patents do not indicate that their physical embodiments are designed to be axially stable in the hole before, during, and after detonation of the seismic charge. In fact, nothing was taught or written in the prior art about elongated members embedding into the soil walls of the bore hole for the purpose of achieving axial stability. The Bassani patent does disclose a plug with wings that have tiny cleats on their tips. In Dr. Hamre's view, these would provide the plug with two planes of support. However, Dr. Hamre did agree that there was only a minimal linear dimension between the tips of the flange and the small cleats on their underside. Consequently, these small projections cannot achieve sufficient axial stability, as disclosed in the Almecon patent.
[46]
Unlike the above prior art patents, the Almecon patent discloses a topping and tamping plug that achieves axial stability in the bore hole without the use of a stinger pole or any other device. The plug embodied in the Almecon patent maintains its axial stability in the bore hole before, during, and after detonation of the explosive charge through the interaction of its outwardly and rearwardly-extending elongated members. The Almecon patent does not teach frictional engagement between the plug's elongated members and the surface of the bore hole walls. The elongated members of the Almecon plug embed into the soil of the bore hole, and they do not bend so as to allow for diametrical size adjustment. The elongated members also do not perform a plugging function; rather, the diameter of the plug's body resembles that of the bore hole, so that the body member can plug or tamp the hole. Hence, the Ovelson and Bassani patents could not have anticipated the invention described in claims 1 and 5 of the Almecon patent.
[47]
The parties agree that the Ovelson/Nutron Perma Plug and its successors, as well as the Bassani Tiger Paw plug, were at all material times used as both tamping and topping plugs, although their respective patents disclose only topping plugs. In general, each of these prior art fan-shaped plugs consists of a continuously-tapering body which terminates in a flange or wings that protrude at a right angle from the rearward end of the plug. In contrast, the Almecon plug consists of a cylindrical body member with a distinct top or end that resembles a truncated cone. The elongated members of the Almecon plug are more like claws than wings or a flange. Furthermore, these protrude rearwardly from the body member of the plug, at an acute angle.
[48]
Because the Ovelson Perma Plug has a tendency to skitter down the bore hole upon insertion, it requires a specially-designed stinger pole to facilitate its installation into the bore hole. Dr. Hamre discussed the need for a stinger pole in order to achieve axial stability of the Perma Plug in the bore hole, before the shot occurs. In his view, axial stability of the Perma Plug can only be achieved through the interaction of the tapered body of the Perma Plug in conjunction with a centrally-located aperture to accommodate the stinger pole. The Almecon plug, in contrast, does not require the use of a special tool in order to achieve axial alignment and stability.
[49]
When installed within the bore hole ("in situ"), the fan-shaped plugs more closely resemble the Almecon plug because their wings or flanges are bent rearwards, toward the bore hole opening. In fact, the defendant asserts that, when installed in the bore hole, the Perma Plug would immediately be recognized by the person skilled in the art as coming totally within claim 1 of the Almecon patent.
[50]
Similarly, in relation to the Ovelson Perma Plug and the Bassani Tiger Paw, Dr. Hamre indicated that the elongated members of the plugs extend both outwardly and rearwardly when the plugs are in place in the bore hole. However, it is difficult to accept that there is an outward extension of the elongated members of the prior art plugs "in situ", particularly when an outward extension requires that the tips of the extended members describe a diameter that is greater than that of the body member of the plug. Dr. Hamre did concede, though, that the Ovelson and Bassani plugs did not display rearwardly-projecting elongated members when not observed "in situ".
[51]
In order to be functional, it is necessary that the fan-shaped plugs conform to the shape of the bore hole. However, some similarity in appearance between the fan-shaped plugs, "in situ", and the Almecon plug is insufficient to justify a finding of invalidity of the Almecon patent due to anticipation.
[52]
While there is some resemblance between the fan-shaped plugs "in situ" and the Almecon plug, the manner in which the two types of plugs function in the bore hole is quite different. The evidence demonstrates that the prior art fan-shaped plugs merely operate through frictional engagement and shear resistance between the wings of the plugs and the surface of the bore hole walls. As Dr. Hamre noted, the radial rim members of the fan-shaped plugs bend rearwardly in the hole so as to ensure maximum frictional engagement between the members and the bore hole walls. The Perma Plug, for example, relies upon flat-surface contact and friction between its wings and the bore hole walls to maintain the plug's position in the bore hole. It does not rely upon penetration of its wings into the surrounding soil.
[53]
In contrast, as Dr. Hamre explained, it is the body member of the Almecon plug that interacts frictionally with the walls of the bore hole, while the stiff, protruding elongated members or claws penetrate the surface of the bore hole wall and embed into the soil, so as to resist the force of the shot blast. In fact, as determined above, the Almecon patent discloses a plug that achieves axial stability through the interaction of its body member with the elongated members. The Almecon patent and plug therefore differ from the prior art in that frictional engagement is not the sole means of maintaining axial stability in the bore hole, and the elongated members do not provide the only points of contact between the seismic plug and the surrounding walls of the hole.
[54]
Moreover, according to Dr. Hamre, the outwardly-extending members of the Ovelson Perma Plug and the Bassani Tiger Paw provide only a single plane of support, and can attain only "a degree" of axial stability. True axial stability can only be achieved, in his view, with the presence of at least two planes of support. In this regard, Dr. Hamre concluded that the Almecon King Plug, with its two sets of claws, can achieve true axial stability. The prior art patents and plugs, however, cannot do so through the action of only one row of elongated members. Accordingly, Dr. Hamre concluded that the Almecon King Plug represents a novel structure over the prior art.
[55]
As I have found previously, the plugs of the Ovelson and Bassani patents were subject to blowouts and misalignments. It is apparent that one of the advantages of the Almecon plug's moulded design is that its claws are stiff, thereby ensuring that they will properly embed into the walls of the bore hole. Although the flanges on the Ovelson and Bassani plugs resemble rearwardly-extending members when the plugs are "in situ", the non-moulded plugs do not have stiff claws that facilitate embedding into the surrounding soil.
[56]
According to Mr. Anderson, if the flange of the Perma Plug were as stiff as the elongated members of the Almecon King Plug, it would be extremely difficult to insert the Perma Plug into the bore hole; thus, the members of a fan-shaped plug must be weaker and more flexible. This results in members which cannot withstand the shot force, and which can therefore become deformed through the right angle position by the shot force.
[57]
Accordingly, the above prior art devices do not function in a manner that is mechanically-equivalent to that of the Almecon plug. Stiff, rearwardly-extending members are an advantage in the Almecon plug that was not possible with the prior art plugs. The combination of stiff, rearwardly-extending members, acting in conjunction with the body member, produces an axially-stable plug that will effectively dig or embed itself into the walls of the bore hole in order to maintain its position during and after the shot. Thus, the Almecon plug constitutes an advancement, over the prior art, as a topping and tamping plug.
[58]
The novelty of the Almecon plug is confirmed by its actual commercial use. For example, one of the plaintiff's witnesses, Mr. Lowe, who supervised a seismic crew, stated that when the fan-shaped plugs were inserted into the bore hole before detonation, their flanges were often found to be bent both forwards and backwards following the shot. This was the case even with the Perma Plug, the prior art plug which the defendant claimed was the most difficult to insert into a conventional-sized bore hole. In contrast, the King Plug embodiment of the Almecon patent was almost impossible to remove from the hole. According to the testimony of Dr. Hamre, Mr. Lowe, and Mr. Williams, another of the plaintiff's witnesses who also supervised a seismic crew, the prior art plugs also did not exhibit axial stability in the bore hole. Both Mr. Lowe and Mr. Williams confirmed that the frequency of blowouts and misalignments of seismic plugs diminished considerably when the Almecon King Plug was used, as compared with the Ovelson and Bassani plugs. In conclusion, the Ovelson and Bassani plugs, as physical embodiments of the Ovelson and Bassani patents, could not have anticipated the invention described in claims 1 and 5 of the Almecon patent.
[59]
The defendant also argues that the French patent, which was published on March 28, 1951, and which describes a plug to be used in hardrock mining, anticipated the Almecon patent. Mr. Luoma was made aware of the French patent during this lawsuit, but was unaware of it in 1984.
[60]
The defendant asserts that a person skilled in the seismic art who was searching for a solution to the problem of resistance to explosive pressure, and who desired a topping plug that could resist a blast, would find the answer in the French patent. Thus, it is argued that the French patent would provide the same level of information as the Almecon patent, in light of the common general knowledge in existence in 1984.
[61]
As a preliminary matter, a question was raised as to whether the French patent does in fact constitute prior art. According to Dr. Hamre, a skilled person would conduct a search of prior art in the hardrock mining industry. While this would appear, at first blush, to be reasonable, Mr. Luoma testified that he would not have been interested in this patent in 1984 because its invention was intended to operate only through frictional engagement. Similarly, Mr. Anderson indicated that the French patent would be of no assistance because the device described therein would have a restricted ability to embed.
[62]
A distinction between the seismic industry and the hardrock blasting industry was made clear by Dr. Hamre. The seismic industry utilizes substantially smaller explosive charges than the blasting industry, which focuses on movement and shattering of rock and overburden. Seismic readings depend upon shock, not upon the subsequent pressure energy or blast energy from the large explosive charges used in the blasting industry. In light of the foregoing, I find that it is unlikely that information relating to the hardrock mining industry would be resorted to by the skilled and knowledgable seismic crew technician with no inventive skill. Nevertheless, even if a person skilled in the art did consult the French patent, the patent differs substantially from the Almecon patent and, in my opinion, does not anticipate the Almecon patent.
[63]
The French patent relates to the art of blasting, and teaches a plug which differs from that disclosed in the Almecon patent in a number of respects. The French patent describes a buttressing device for hardrock bore holes in the hardrock mining industry. It does not disclose a topping plug, nor a plug used in seismic exploration. Furthermore, the French patent does not describe a plug that is axially stable as a result of the interaction of elongated members with the body member, nor does it teach the desirability of axial stability. The plug described in the French patent was invented for the purpose of trapping gases during mining; it was also intended to be destroyed during the shot blast. The metal strips of the buttressing device of the French patent do not embed themselves into the bore hole walls; rather, the evidence suggests that the extremities or tips of the strips anchor into the irregularities in the rocks in the bore hole walls. Moreover, unlike the patent in suit, the French patent is designed to resist movement.
[64]
I am of the opinion that the French patent, while clearly a prior publication, does not teach, for the above reasons, all of the subject matter necessary to produce the Almecon patent without the exercise of inventive skill. Moreover, it does not give clear and unmistakable directions that would teach the invention to a skilled person:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  prior art patents or industry products.
Obviousness
[66]
The difference between anticipation and obviousness was described by G.F. Takach,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : A Canadian Compendium of Law and Practice
(Edmonton, Alberta: Juriliber Limited, 1993), at page 38, as follows:
"[A]nticipation suggests that 'your invention, though clever, was already known', while obviousness suggests that 'any fool could have done that'. Prior art that is insufficient for anticipation may be sufficient to show obviousness. The major difference in applying the test for each is that anticipation requires an exact prior description in a single source, while obviousness can be based on everything from a single disclosure to a 'mosaic' of the entire state of the art. ... [A] patent lacking inventiveness cannot be novel, but a patent lacking novelty may possess the inventiveness required." (Footnotes omitted)
Thus, a patent which has not been rendered invalid for anticipation may nevertheless be found invalid for obviousness.
[67]
The test for obviousness was set out by Hugessen, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  inventors did or would have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive.
"The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man on the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy."
Accordingly, the unimaginative, skilled technician, who possesses the common general knowledge of the relevant technological field, must look at the available prior art, without engaging in an ex post facto analysis, and determine whether the invention would be arrived at directly and without difficulty:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 449 (T.D.). The perspective of the notional skilled worker must be taken at the date of the invention. Furthermore, it cannot be assumed that, in looking for references in the prior art, the unimaginative, non-inventive technician skilled in the art would go outside the art at issue, and consider art in other fields:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C. T.D.), affd. (1978), 22 N.R. 511; 37 C.P.R.(2d) 37 (F.C.A.).
[68]
Something is said to be obvious when it would occur directly to an ordinary person skilled in the relevant art, searching for something novel without serious thought, research, or experiment: G.F. Takach, supra, at page 37. The courts have considered a number of objective criteria in considering whether or not there is evidence of a "scintilla of inventiveness" necessary to support the patent:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at page 368, the following criteria were considered: the device is novel and superior to what was previously available; it has since been used widely and in preference to alternative devices; competitors and experts in the field had never thought of the combination; amazement accompanied its first publication; and commercial success followed after the introduction of the invention.
[69]
The defendant alleges that the Almecon patent is rendered obvious by a number of patents and prior art products. In other words, and stated somewhat simply, the defendant asserts there was no invention.
[70]
Specifically, the defendant argues that there is no invention in rearwardly-inclined elongated members combined with the other known elements in the prior art. Furthermore, the defendant alleges that it would directly occur to the person skilled in the art to turn back the elongated members of the Perma Plug in order to facilitate insertion of the device into the bore hole. In the defendant's view, problems related to insertion in the bore hole presented the major difficulty with the prior art plugs, and both Nutron and Almecon reached a similar solution at the same time.
[71]
The defendant also relies upon a form of mosaic argument. According to such a contention, if one piece of prior art is considered along with one or more pieces of other prior art, the pieces together might be sufficient to meet the test for obviousness. For instance, the defendant argues that the Ovelson patent, which describes a topping plug only, might not provide enough information to the skilled worker so as to anticipate the patent in suit. However, when considered along with the Ovelson plug, the missing information relating to tamping and insertion into the bore hole prior to detonation is provided, and the Almecon patent is, in that way, rendered obvious.
[72]
In essence, the defendant maintains that it is attempting to preserve its right to manufacture a seismic plug which is, in all practical respects, the equivalent and the continuation of its original Perma Plug that has been manufactured by the company since the 1970s. The evolution of the Nutron plugs from the Auger Plug and Perma Plug, to the Flex Seal and Perma Seal, up to the Super Grip, in the defendant's view, goes to the obviousness of the transition, and therefore highlights the lack of inventiveness of the Almecon patent and plug.
[73]
The plaintiff asserts that the concept of stiff, rearwardly-extending elongated members which embed in the walls of the bore hole would have escaped the unimaginative skilled worker who, in 1984, was attempting to solve the problems of blowouts and misalignments in the seismic industry.
[74]
The parties agree that the court should determine whether, at the date of the invention, the subject matter of the Almecon patent was obvious to a person skilled in the art, in light of the common general knowledge in the industry, and in conjunction with the following prior art industry patents:
a. Canadian patent No. 827,427, granted to Ace Explosives Ltd. in 1969 (the "Ace Drive Point patent");
b. Canadian patent No. 920,508 -- the Ovelson patent;
c. Canadian patent No. 1,048,405 -- the Bassani patent;
d. Canadian patent No. 1,198,050, granted to Ace Explosives, (1984) Ltd. Canada in 1985 (the "Ace Cling II patent");
e. United States patent No. 3,173,368, granted to Trojan Powder Company in 1965 (the "U.S. patent"); and
f. French patent No. 977,180 -- the French patent.
The Almecon patent specifies the Ace Drive Point and Ace Cling II patents, as well as the Ovelson, Bassani, and U.S. patents. The only patent which is not advanced in the Almecon patent is the French patent.
[75]
It must also be determined if the subject matter of the Almecon patent was rendered obvious by the following products:
a. the Ovelson/Nutron Perma Plug;
b. the Ovelson/Nutron Auger Plug;
c. the Nutron Perma Seal plug;
d. the Nutron Flex Seal plug;
e. the Bassani Tiger Paw plug;
f. the invention embodied in the Ace Drive Point patent (the "Ace Drive Point");
g. the invention embodied in the Ace Cling II patent (the "Cling II plug");
h. the Lieffers Drillers plug, designed by Jeffrey Diederichs; and
i. the Bassani Powder Point.
In the defendant's view, the concept of rearwardly-inclined elongated members on the bodies of seismic plugs manifested itself in one or more of the above plugs or drive points.
[76]
As I indicated previously, both Nutron and Almecon were attempting to develop a better seismic plug during the early 1980s. The defendant's concern related to insertion of the plug into the bore hole, and not to blowouts or misalignments, both of which can result in open holes. Dr. Hamre indicated that it was simply a matter of choice to angle backwards the wings of the prior art plugs, so as to facilitate their insertion into the bore hole. He noted, for example, that the Ace Explosives company had progressed in their patent from radial arms to a Sand Point with rearwardly-extending arms. Dr. Hamre concluded that it was an obvious step to bend back the wings on the Perma Plug in order to achieve a design similar to the bent-back wings of the Super Grip and Almecon plugs, which would provide for better ease of insertion.
[77]
I am satisfied that the most pressing problems facing the seismic drilling industry at the date of the Almecon invention were blowouts and misalignments. Open holes were an inescapable result of blowouts. Mr. Hobson confirmed that misalignments were also problematic at that time since early seismic plugs could be easily tilted or dislodged during the blast. In fact, the defendant acknowledged that there may have been blowouts in the seismic industry in the early 1980s; however, relying upon the evidence of Mr. Melnyk, a provincial government official, the defendant suggested that the blowouts were not merely the result of plug design; rather, the frequency of blowouts depended upon a number of other factors, including hole size, plug design, winter conditions, soil conditions, water levels, crew conditions, and poor workmanship.
[78]
The King Plug met with instant commercial success in the seismic industry. Correspondingly, the Super Grip is by far Nutron's best-selling plug. While Nutron continues to manufacture the Perma Plug and Auger Plug, well over 90% of its plug sales constitute sales of the Super Grip. As such, while the defendant de-emphasises the presence of any inventive step regarding the Almecon patent, it is abundantly clear that the introduction of the King Plug was followed by considerable demand for this product. The Super Grip's apparent success readily supports the importance of the defendant's design change as well.
[79]
The test for obviousness is a difficult one to satisfy. In light of the state of the art and the common general knowledge at the date of the invention, would the skilled seismic crew technician have come directly, and without difficulty, to the solution taught by the patent in suit? In my opinion, the defendant has not satisfied me that, on a balance of probabilities, this would have occurred.
[80]
The Ovelson and Bassani patents disclose a device to resist downward pressure in the bore hole. The Ovelson patent does not teach a tamping plug; it describes a topping plug which operates on the basis of frictional engagement. The Ovelson patent was directed at preventing the seismic plug from being washed down the bore hole, rather than preventing it from being blown out of the hole. Similarly, the Bassani patent was concerned with preventing seismic plugs, through frictional engagement, from slipping down the bore hole under the weight of the grout or cement placed on top of the plugs. Thus, the Ovelson and Bassani patents teach away from the invention of the Almecon patent.
[81]
As discussed previously, the fan-shaped plugs which embody the inventions described in the Ovelson and Bassani patents are incapable of supporting elongated members which are stiff enough to carry out the embedding function disclosed in the Almecon patent. I have also found that these plugs can only achieve "a degree" of axial stability. Furthermore, Dr. Hamre was unable to conclude that stability was achieved in any of the plugs through the interaction of its elongated members with its body member. I am of the opinion that, in light of this common general knowledge, the person skilled in the art would not have arrived at the desired solution in the Almecon patent without difficulty.
[82]
I am not satisfied that the existence of the French patent, in and of itself or as part of a mosaic of the entire state of the art at the relevant time, is sufficient to satisfy the test for obviousness. Once again, the uninventive skilled technician would not likely turn to a patent relating to hardrock mining when attempting to solve the problems of blowouts and misalignments that can occur during seismic drilling in softrock environments. There is no evidence that the invention disclosed in the French patent was ever manufactured. Furthermore, according to Dr. Hamre, there is no evidence that anyone in the seismic industry was ever made aware of the French patent prior to this lawsuit. The uninventive skilled technician could not reasonably be assumed to have knowledge of such prior art.
[83]
The defendant alleges that the Ace Cling II patent and its Cling II plug comprise part of the common general knowledge which existed in the seismic industry in 1984, and render the Almecon patent invalid. The device disclosed in the Ace Cling II patent has a joint where the flange connects with the body, and does not embody rearwardly-extending elongated members. The device, as described, also differs from the invention in the Almecon patent because it does not have the same embedding characteristics.
[84]
According to Mr. Williams and Mr. Hobson, the physical embodiment of the Ace Cling II patent did not work. The Cling II plug was blown out of the hole in every test that Mr. Williams performed on the plug. Furthermore, the Cling II plug did not receive government approval to be sold in Canada as a seismic plug. Therefore, the Ace Cling II patent and plug, when considered in light of the relevant common general knowledge in existence in 1984, do not render obvious the Almecon patent.
[85]
The defendant also alleges that the Ace Drive Point patent and the Ace and Bassani Drive Point plugs form part of the common general knowledge in the light of which the invention of the Almecon patent is rendered obvious. As indicated by Mr. Luoma, drive points have been used in Canada since the 1970s. They are shuttle-like devices that assist in fixing explosives at, or near, the bottom of the bore hole. Although they consist of a plastic, cylindrical body with rearwardly-projecting fingers, drive points do not function as plugs. They are also obliterated by the blast.
[86]
Can it be said that these prior art products and patents, when used or examined by an unimaginative skilled technician, in light of the common general knowledge, would have led this competent workman to the invention? In my opinion, the solution arrived at through the Almecon patent was not obvious to the unimaginative skilled worker in light of the prior art drive point patent and plugs, and the common general knowledge which existed at the date of the invention.
[87]
In my view, the U.S. patent and the Lieffers Drillers plug also do not render obvious the Almecon patent.
[88]
In conclusion, the Almecon patent was not rendered obvious by the prior art patents or the prior art industry products in existence in 1984.
Overbreadth Of Claims 1 And 5
[89]
The defendant asserts that the Almecon patent is invalid because claims 1 and 5 are broader than the alleged invention disclosed in the specification of the patent. The defendant alleges overbreadth of claims 1 and 5 for two reasons: (a) the claims do not require "elongated members" at both ends of the body member, without which the plug disclosed in the Almecon patent does not have axial stability when inserted in a bore hole; and, (b) the claims do not require the elongated members to be configured to set into the bore hole walls when the seismic charge is detonated.
[90]
The plaintiff asserts that the claims coverage is not limited to the specific examples or embodiments described in the patent:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  read in isolation without the assistance of the expert evidence accepted at trial, and the remainder of the specification, to the extent that it bears on the meaning of the claims:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  overbroad because the claim is not limited to the requirement that elongated members be included at both ends of the Almecon plug. Moreover, if the invention is axially stable as a result of the elongated members only, the defendant asserts that claim 1 should have been narrowed to require elongated members at both ends of the plug. In the defendant's view, the Almecon Queen Plug, which only has elongated members at one end of the body member, is not operable. Accordingly, the claims are overly broad.
[92]
In response, the plaintiff points out that the Almecon patent clearly provides that the elongated members may be included at the front end of the plug; at the back end of the plug; or at both ends, as in the King Plug, which is the preferred embodiment.
[93]
The Almecon patent does make it apparent that elongated members may be placed at the front or back or both ends of the plug. This was confirmed by Dr. Hamre and Mr. Anderson. The preferred embodiment of the invention does have elongated members projecting from both ends of the plug; however, the scope of the invention which can be claimed is not limited to the preferred embodiment.
[94]
In addition, according to Dr. Hamre, the axial stability required in claim 1 is only that which is sufficient to enable the plug's elongated members to embed into the soil walls of the bore hole. In his view, the Almecon King Plug, even without the elongated members at the front end, still has axial stability as a result of the arrangement of the body member and the outwardly and rearwardly-extending members at the back end. As discussed previously, axial stability is not only a function of the elongated members of the Almecon patent -- it is also a function of the length and diameter of the plug's body member relative to the bore hole diameter. Thus, according to Dr. Hamre, two sets of elongated members are not essential in order to achieve the measure of axial stability intended by the Almecon patent.
[95]
(b) The defendant contends that the claims in the Almecon patent do not state explicitly that the elongated members are configured so as to "set into" the bore hole walls when the seismic charge is detonated -- an essential aspect of the invention. Furthermore, according to the defendant, if the invention had been designed so that its elongated members could set into the soil in order to provide axial stability in the bore hole, the patentee could have specifically expressed this in the patent.
[96]
The plaintiff notes that the defendant's expert, Dr. Hamre, indicated that, from his review of the Almecon patent, the force of the explosive charge results in a flexing of the plug, which causes it to move slightly up the bore hole. In Dr. Hamre's opinion, this serves to set the elongated members into the sides of the hole to confine the blast, or to keep the plug in the bore hole. Furthermore, the plaintiff points out that the function of the elongated members in setting into the walls of the bore hole is discussed in the disclosure of the Almecon patent.
[97]
The claims of the Almecon patent recite a moulded plug comprising a body member surrounded by elongated members which project outwardly and rearwardly. The Almecon patent also claims that the diameter of the body member of the plug is essentially the same as the diameter of the bore hole. Accordingly, as discussed earlier in these reasons, the elongated members of the Almecon patent invention must set into the walls of the bore hole because their tips describe a diameter which is greater than that of the body member, and consequently that of the bore hole. Thus, the tips of the elongated members extend beyond the parameters of the bore hole, and must therefore penetrate, or embed into, the bore hole walls.
[98]
I have already determined that the Almecon plug is axially stable as a result of the interaction of its elongated members with its body member. It is clear that the structure of the Almecon plug, as described, will produce the desired result: the elongated members of the plug will embed into the soil walls of the bore hole when the explosive charge is detonated. The patentee need not claim the result of its patented design, provided the result can be determined from the structure as claimed. The structure of claim 1 does give the promised result of embedding the plug into the walls of the bore hole. Accordingly, claims 1 and 5 are not broader than the invention disclosed.
Ambiguity
[99]
According to s. 34 of the
Patent Act
, supra, a patent specification, which includes both the disclosure and the claims, requires a description of the invention and the methods of producing or constructing it, coupled with claims which state those novel features of the invention in which the applicant claims an exclusive right. The specification must define the precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and the privilege claimed.
[100]
The description in a patent specification must be sufficient to enable a person skilled in the art to successfully produce the invention using only the instructions contained in the disclosure: per Lamer, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 257, at pages 267-268. If the meaning of a phrase or expression would not be clear to a person skilled in the art, that patent may be ambiguous:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.), at page 222. If it is impossible to say with some certainty which of several suggested constructions of a patent is the correct one, the claim may fail for ambiguity. Where the language of a patent is ambiguous or vague, a claim may be invalid:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  yet, where a term in a patent claim can be interpreted in light of the entire specification, the claim may not be held to be invalid because of ambiguity:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of the Almecon patent are ambiguous and avoidably uncertain because they fail to define what is meant by "axial stability", or because they fail to define distinctly, and in explicit terms, the means to achieve such axial stability. The defendant asserts that the Almecon patent is ambiguous in its avoidable failure to define the alleged distinctions between the tamping and topping plug of the patent, and the acknowledged prior art topping plugs. Moreover, the defendant asserts that the Almecon patent is ambiguous in failing to disclose, or in ambiguously claiming, a plug having elongated members which extend from the plug body, and which are purportedly "so arranged as to give the plug axial stability when inserted into a bore hole".
[102]
It is clear that the phrase "axial stability" refers to the ability of the Almecon plug to maintain its alignment upon insertion into the bore hole, during shooting, and following the shot. As Dr. Hamre explained, a plug that displays axial stability has its longitudinal axis aligned with the axis of the bore hole. The desired axial stability is that which is sufficient to allow the elongated members of the plug to embed in the soil and hold the plug body in place so that it can effectively tamp the hole. As discussed earlier, the axial stability of the Almecon plug is achieved by the outwardly and rearwardly-extending elongated members and their arrangement around a body member of a particular length and diameter. Although axial stability is partly a function of the body length and diameter of the plug, relative to the bore hole diameter, it is clear that the plug body and the elongated members together interact to provide axial stability.
[103]
A patent cannot be invalidated simply because the claims are capable of more than one construction, or might have been better drafted. In my opinion, the claims in the Almecon patent are as explicit as the subject matter requires. Therefore, claims 1 and 5 are not ambiguous.
[104]
The onus is on the defendant to demonstrate that, on a balance of probabilities, the patent is invalid. I am not satisfied that the defendant has met this burden. The Almecon patent teaches an inventive step which represents an advance in the art regarding topping and tamping plugs. In my opinion, the patent is valid.
3. Does The Nutron Super Grip Plug
Which Was Sold After April 7, 1987,
Infringe Claims 1 And 5 Of The
Almecon Patent?
[105]
The question of patent infringement is a mixed question of fact and law. The initial construction of the claims is a question of law:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . However, once the claims of the patent have been interpreted, the task of determining whether a claim has been infringed becomes essentially one of fact:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 176 (F.C.A.). The court must consider what has, in fact, been done by the alleged infringer.
[106]
The burden is on the plaintiff to show infringement. By comparing the allegedly infringing item with the patent specification (both disclosure and claims), it must be decided whether the item falls within the scope of the patent in suit. If it does, there is infringement:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C. T.D.), affd. (1979), 28 N.R. 273; 42 C.P.R.(2d) 33 (F.C.A). If a variant of an aspect of a claim has no material effect on the way the invention works, there is a presumption that the patent is infringed, and that the patentee intended that the variant fall within the scope of the claim:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 238 (T.D.).
[107]
In the recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Oil Corp. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the test for patent infringement was considered. In that case, Marceau, J.A., considered the traditional twofold test for infringement, according to which the court must first decide whether the defendant's activities fall clearly within the words of the plaintiff's claims; if they do not, the court must go on to determine if the defendant's activities have nevertheless taken the substance of the plaintiff's invention, as defined by the patent claims. Marceau, J.A., however, expressed his doubts in regard to such an approach, and questioned the utility, and even the relevance, of the twofold test.
[108]
In
Mobil Oil Corporation
, supra, Marceau, J.A., at pages 20-21, noted the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.), wherein Thorson, P., stated that a person is guilty of infringement if he takes the substance of an invention, whether or not he omits a feature that is not essential to the invention, or substitutes an equivalent for it. Marceau, J.A., then indicated that the court should not endeavour to create a distinction between a substantive and a textual infringement, particularly where such a distinction may be difficult to draw; rather, as Marceau, J.A., stated, at page 21, the court should construe the claims "so as to determine what exactly lies within the scope of the inventor's rights. Once this has been determined, the court can then determine whether the defendant's product falls within the scope of the claim".
[109]
The parties agree that there are two issues regarding infringement. It must be determined whether the elongated members of the Super Grip plugs which were sold by the defendant after the grant of the Almecon patent (the "post-grant Super Grip plugs") are arranged so as to give the plugs axial stability when inserted into the bore hole. Moreover, it must be decided whether these plugs have a forward end with a somewhat-flattened end part (claim 1), or an end part with the configuration of a truncated cone (claim 5), or the functional equivalents.
[110]
The plaintiff alleges that the post-grant Super Grip plugs are axially stable when inserted into a bore hole. This axial stability, according to the plaintiff, arises from the outwardly and rearwardly-extending elongated members that are arranged symmetrically about the body member of each plug. The plaintiff also claims that each of the post-grant Super Grip plugs has an end part which is the functional equivalent of a somewhat-flattened end, shaped in the configuration of a truncated cone. Thus, the plaintiff asserts that the post-grant Super Grip plugs infringe claims 1 and 5 of the Almecon patent.
[111]
The defendant argues that each post-grant Super Grip plug has a pointed tip, not a flattened end part. The defendant also asserts that it is only the elongated members which provide these plugs with axial stability. Moreover, the defendant contends that there is only one plane of stability in each post-grant Super Grip plug, while there are two planes of stability in the Almecon plug. Accordingly, it is argued that the defendant's Super Grip plugs do not infringe the plaintiff's patent, as they do not come within the scope of the claims.
[112]
The defendant also raises the " <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> defence". In this regard, the defendant asserts that, if the alleged infringement is patentably indistinguishable from the prior art, then the claims of the patent are too broad if they read on the alleged infringement, because they also read on the prior art. If the claims of the patent are not sufficiently wide to include the alleged infringement, the patentee cannot complain. In other words, if the product which is allegedly infringing cannot be distinguished from prior art, and it falls within the claims of the patent in suit, then the patent is invalid for anticipation or obviousness. On the other hand, if the patent does not include the alleged infringing product, there is no patent infringement:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 480. Thus, the defendant contends that it must succeed on either invalidity or non-infringement.
[113]
Stated somewhat differently, the defendant claims that the post-grant Super Grip plugs were designed to solve the problem of difficulty of insertion, and are therefore patentably indistinguishable from the prior art, in particular the Perma Plug; thus, if the Almecon patent reads on the post-grant Super Grip plugs, it also reads on the prior art, and would consequently be invalid. If it does not read on the Super Grip, there is no infringement.
[114]
The parties agree that the post-grant Super Grip plugs are tamping and topping plugs. Each Super Grip plug has a body member with a forward and a rearward end, and a plurality of elongated members extending outwardly and rearwardly from at least one end of the body member. The body member of each plug consists of a slightly-tapered cylindrical shape with sloping sides and a substantially-closed forward end. The elongated members of each Super Grip plug are attached at the rearward end of the body member, and are arranged symmetrically about the plug body. The body member of each post-grant Super Grip plug terminates in a tapering, or conical, end section with curving sides. This end section is essentially flat at its furthest end, apart from a pointed little nub protruding from the flattened surface.
[115]
The post-grant Super Grip plugs also have weblike networks that connect the tips of the elongated members. According to Mr. Anderson, the weblike connection should effectively be considered part of the body of each plug. The elongated members of each plug still extend beyond this weblike extension of the body member.
[116]
The post-grant Super Grip plugs are inserted into the bore hole before detonation of the explosives, and are intended to remain in place in the bore hole during and after the shot. A brochure which was prepared by Nutron in 1986 or 1987 discusses the operation of the Super Grip plug, and explains the following: (a) the method by which the plug is forced to back up slightly in the bore hole during detonation; (b) the manner in which its elongated members dig into the holes; and (c) the fact that the plug is permanently locked in place.
[117]
Mr. Martin asserted that the brochure describes a prototype of the Super Grip plug which is now obsolete. The significance of this document in respect to the development of the Super Grip plug remains unclear. What is clear, however, is that the description of the functionality of the plug depicted in the diagrams entitled "Super Grip After Installation" and "Super Grip After Detonation" replicates very closely the workings of the plug described in the Almecon patent.
[118]
Dr. Hamre was of the opinion that neither the Perma Plug nor the Super Grip plug represents a plug that has "said members arranged to give axial stability in the bore hole". In contrast, he stated that the Almecon King Plug is aptly described by that phrase. Dr. Hamre did agree, however, that if claim 1 of the Almecon patent is construed to mean that the body member and the elongated members of the Almecon plug work together to provide axial stability, then the post-grant Super Grip plugs also have axial stability. Dr. Hamre further agreed that the elongated members of the Super Grip plugs, in and of themselves, provide a degree of axial stability sufficient to allow embedding in the soil during detonation of the charge. Clearly, then, the design of the post-grant Super Grip plugs ensures that their function essentially replicates that of the Almecon plug.
[119]
The truncated end which is described in claim 5 of the Almecon patent refers to a closed end that absorbs the shock of the pressure wave during the explosion. The plaintiff has suggested that the defendant's variation of that feature is meaningless, and that the truncated ends of the defendant's post-grant Super Grip plugs represent the functional equivalent of the truncated cone of the Almecon plug. In the plaintiff's view, the scope of claim 5 permits minor variants, including the shape of the end part.
[120]
Although the sides of the conical end part in each post-grant Super Grip plug curve slightly toward their forward end, they are nonetheless aptly described as truncated cones. Dr. Hamre agreed that the predecessor of the post-grant Super Grip plugs terminated at the fore end in a flattened front end part, which end part was shaped in the configuration of a truncated cone. This version was modified after May 1987, upon Nutron being notified of patent infringement by the plaintiff. However, Dr. Hamre was of the opinion that the post-grant Super Grip plug which possesses a small, pointed tip at the centre of its flattened end part could not be considered a somewhat-flattened end part or a truncated cone.
[121]
Nevertheless, between the two configurations of the Super Grip plugs (i.e., post and pre-grant), Dr. Hamre could find no material difference in the manner in which they functioned. In considering a diagram which showed the full side elevation of each of these two end parts, Dr. Hamre agreed that there is a basic similarity in the front end cross-sectional shapes of the two versions of Nutron's plugs. Mr. Anderson also testified that the minor change in configuration of the end part of the defendant's plug had no effect on the way in which the plug functioned.
[122]
In addition, Dr. Hamre was of the opinion that the shape of the front end part of the Almecon plug was not essential to the operation of the invention. Moreover, he suggested that the shape of the front end of the Almecon plug was irrelevant to the resultant force generated on that surface. In his view, it is the entire exposed transverse area of the body which intercepts any pressure wave resulting from the seismic shock.
[123]
Furthermore, when comparing the Almecon patent with the French patent, Dr. Hamre noted that the specific shape of the end part of the Almecon plug is not particularly significant. In fact, he noted that the Almecon patent encompasses the complete spectrum of possible end configurations, from full hemispherical to flat. Since that is the case, I find it difficult to accept that a minute protrusion on the otherwise truncated-cone end parts of the defendant's post-grant Super Grip plugs would make any difference to the proper functioning of the seismic plugs.
[124]
I find that the changes made to the defendant's post-grant Super Grip plugs were merely cosmetic, not functional, in nature. Accordingly, the small, pointed tip on the fore end of each post-grant Super Grip plug does not detract from the fact that each plug terminates in a truncated-conical end. The end parts of the post-grant Super Grip plugs function in a manner identical to that of a somewhat-flattened end part in the configuration of a truncated cone. There is no functional advantage by this change in design.
[125]
As part of its <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> defence, the defendant argues that the Nutron Perma Plug has all of the elements of the Super Grip. According to the defendant, they are both bore hole plugs which fulfil topping and tamping purposes. Both plugs have a body with a front and rear end, and a somewhat-flattened end part. The Perma Plug has elongated members that extend outwardly and rearwardly when the plug is inserted in the hole, taking on a shape not dramatically different from that of the Super Grip plug. Furthermore, according to Dr. Hamre, the Perma Plug has a degree of axial stability by the action of the body and the elongated members when inserted into the bore hole. The defendant therefore contends that if the post-grant Super Grip plugs infringe the Almecon patent, then so does the Perma Plug. Moreover, if the Perma plug infringes the Almecon patent, and it is prior art, then the Almecon patent itself is invalid.
[126]
During the time period when the defendant was developing its Super Grip plug, Mr. Rejasse was the General Manager of Nutron. He did not testify at trial. In a letter dated January 15, 1985, Mr. Rejasse wrote to the government of Alberta, seeking approval of the Super Grip plug. By then, Almecon's King Plug was already in production. The defendant argues that the design change from the Perma Plug to the Super Grip was in response to a desire in the industry for a more easily-insertable plug. However, in his letter, Mr. Rejasse explained that the reason for the modification in the design of the Nutron plug was to improve the stability of the plug when inserted into the bore hole. Furthermore, he stated that the addition of elongated members would ensure that the plug would not blow out of the hole during the explosion. There was no indication in Mr. Rejasse's letter that the design change was intended to achieve a plug which would be more easily inserted into the bore hole. Nevertheless, even if the Super Grip plug was designed for ease of insertion into the bore hole, it is clear that its design reduces the probability of blowouts and misalignments.
[127]
I conclude that the post-grant Super Grip plugs display the same characteristics as the Almecon plug, including outwardly and rearwardly-extending elongated members that embed into the walls of the bore hole; a flattened end part in the configuration of a truncated cone; and axial stability before, during, and after the shot. In this regard, the defendant's post-grant Super Grip plugs infringe the Almecon patent.
[128]
I have found that the Almecon patent was not anticipated or rendered obvious by the prior art, and that the defendant's post-grant Super Grip plugs infringe the Almecon patent. I am also unable to accept the defendant's <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> defence.
[129]
The post-grant Super Grip plugs meet all of the claims of the Almecon patent, and differ from the prior art in the same manner as does the Almecon plug. Unlike the prior art, including their predecessors, the post-grant Super Grip plugs have outwardly and rearwardly-extending elongated members which are moulded from the body of the plug. The body of each plug is a tapering cylinder which is distinct from the truncated conical end part found at the forward end of the plug. As Dr. Hamre noted, the elongated members of each post-grant Super Grip plug cooperate with the length and diameter of the body member in order to provide a margin of axial stability in the bore hole which is superior to that of the prior art that relied solely on extended wings for axial stability. Furthermore, the design of the post-grant Super Grip plugs addresses the problems of blowouts and misalignments, not just the difficulty of insertion of the prior art plugs. The Super Grip design cannot be said to be patentably indistinguishable from the prior art. Thus, the defendant's <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> defence fails, and the post-grant Super Grip plugs infringe the Almecon patent.
