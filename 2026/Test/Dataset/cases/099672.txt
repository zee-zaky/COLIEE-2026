Kelen, J.
: The applicant is an inmate at the Fenbrook Medium Security Institution (Fenbrook) located in Gravenhurst, Ontario. Fenbrook has implemented a privatized Inmate Purchasing Service wherein inmates may purchase merchandise from Gravenhurst Home Hardware (Home Hardware) at retail prices. When an inmate purchases an item not regularly stocked by Home Hardware, Home Hardware purchases the item from another retailer and sells it to the inmate with a 20% mark-up for general merchandise and with a 10% mark-up for hobbycraft goods. Fenbrook is the only federal penitentiary at which inmates must pay a mark-up on retail goods purchased for their own use. Other institutions employ an officer who purchases retail goods ordered by the inmate, without charging the inmate any mark-up for the service.
[2]
The applicant seeks a declaration that the contract between the Correctional Service of Canada (the CSC) and Home Hardware constitutes a violation of s. 74 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
and a conspiracy under s. 45(1) of the
Competition Act
to the extent that it grants Home Hardware the exclusive right to market its products to Fenbrook's inmates and charge them a mark-up for doing so.
[3]
On May 28, 2004, the Fenbrook Inmate Welfare Committee (the Inmate Committee), of which the applicant is a member, submitted a first level group grievance challenging the decision to charge mark-ups on items purchased by inmates. In its 44-page presentation, the Inmate Committee described its concern that Home Hardware had charged a 10% mark-up on all non-stocked hobbycraft items and a 20% mark-up on all other non-stocked items. This practice, the Inmate Committee argued, contravened Fenbrook's contract with Home Hardware, which required that Home Hardware attempt to negotiate with suppliers for wholesale prices so that it could sell the items to the inmates at a normal retail price. If wholesale prices were not possible, Home Hardware would charge a mark-up to cover its costs, and the mark-up was to be negotiated semi-annually between Home Hardware and Fenbrook. The Inmate Committee described a feeling among the inmate population of frustration and powerlessness resulting from what it perceived as a forced monopoly by Home Hardware.
[4]
The Inmate Committee's first level grievance was denied. On June 21, 2005, the applicant submitted a second level grievance. On August 23, 2005, the applicant filed with the Court a Notice of Application for judicial review. Section 81(1) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations
provides that a grievance review must be deferred where an offender decides to pursue a legal remedy for the offender's grievance in addition to the internal grievance procedure until a decision is rendered on the alternate remedy or the offender abandons it. On July 5, 2005, the applicant was advised that his second level grievance had been deferred accordingly.

Issues
[6]

2. If the applicant did not bring the application out of time, did the applicant fail to exhaust adequate alternate remedies?
3. Did the CSC fail to consult with inmates when deciding to allow Home Hardware to charge mark-ups to inmates?
4. Does the Court have jurisdiction to determine whether the CSC violated s. 45(1) of the
Competition Act
?

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
?
Analysis
[7]
The respondent, in its oral argument, first addressed the two substantive issues, which the Court has considered below. Then, a second counsel for the respondent raised significant procedural objections to the Court assuming jurisdiction because this application is brought out of time and because the applicant failed to exhaust adequate alternative remedies. I will first address the two procedural objections.
Procedural Issues
Issue No 1
: Did the applicant bring the application out of time?
[8]
With respect to the first procedural objection, the respondent argues that this application for judicial review has been brought out of time and that the Court accordingly has no jurisdiction to review the CSC's decision allowing Home Hardware to charge mark-ups to Fenbrook's inmates. Section 18.1(2) of the
Federal Courts Act
provides as follows:
"JURISDICTION OF FEDERAL COURT
. . . . .
Application for judicial review
"18.1 [...]
Time limitation
"(2) An application for judicial review in respect of a decision or an order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal shall be made within 30 days after the time the decision or order was first communicated by the federal board, commission or other tribunal to the office of the Deputy Attorney General of Canada or to the party directly affected by it, or within any further time that a judge of the Federal Court may fix or allow before or after the end of those 30 days."
"COMPÉTENCE DE LA COUR FÉDÉRALE
. . . . .
Demande de contrôle judiciaire
"18.1 [...]
Délai de présentation
"(2) Les demandes de contrôle judiciaire sont à présenter dans les trente jours qui suivent la première communication, par l'office fédéral, de sa décision ou de son ordonnance au bureau du sous-procureur général du Canada ou à la partie concernée, ou dans le délai supplémentaire qu'un juge de la Cour fédérale peut, avant ou après l'expiration de ces trente jours, fixer ou accorder."
[9]
Under cross-examination on January 23, 2006, the applicant stated that the CSC's decision to allow mark-ups was communicated to him in April 2003:
"Q. And when did you personally find out that CSC would be charging a markup?
A. When I arrived here.
Q. And what year was that?
A. That would have been April, 2003."
Accordingly, s. 18(2) of the
Federal Courts Act
requires that the applicant file an application for judicial review by May 2003. The Notice of Application was filed on August 23, 2005.
[10]
The Federal Court of Appeal held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), that the 30 day time limit for bringing an application for judicial review under s. 18.1(2) of the
Federal Courts Act
does not apply where there is no specific decision or order being challenged but rather an ongoing course of allegedly illegal conduct. In this case, the Applicant sought declarations that the CSC violated s. 45(1) of the
Competition Act
and s. 74 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
. Such declarations would have the effect of preventing the CSC from continuing its alleged ongoing course of illegal conduct per <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Accordingly, I am satisfied that the time limit under s. 18.1(2) would not apply.
Issue No. 2
: Did the applicant fail to exhaust adequate alternate remedies?
[11]
With respect to the second procedural objection, the respondent argues that the Court ought not to review the CSC's decision in 2000 to contract with Home Hardware for purchase procurement services on the basis that the applicant has not exhausted adequate alternative remedies before seeking a judicial review.
[12]
The applicant argues that, where the legality of the CSC's decision is in question, it is naïve to expect the grievance commissioner to vindicate the inmates' position since doing so would be admitting illegal activity. Forcing the inmates to exhaust options in a flawed system, it is argued, is forcing inmates disaffected by the CSC's allegedly unlawful act to endure more illegality until the matter is eventually brought to Court.
[13]
I agree with the respondent's submissions that the proper course is for the applicant to follow the statutorily-mandated grievance process. In this regard, I adopt the statements of Mr. Justice Rothstein (as he then was) in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 148 F.T.R. 81, at 84 (T.D.), at paragraph 10:
"On its face, the legislative scheme providing for grievances is an adequate alternative remedy to judicial review. Grievances are to be handled expeditiously and time limits are provided in the Commissioner's Directives. There is no suggestion that the process is costly. If anything it is less costly than judicial review and more simple and straightforward. Through the grievance procedure an inmate may appeal a decision on the merits and an appeal tribunal may substitute its decision for that of the tribunal appealed from.
Judicial review does not deal with the merits and a favourable result to an inmate would simply return the matter for redetermination to the tribunal appealed from.
" (Emphasis added)
[14]
Accordingly, I would dismiss the application for failure to exhaust alternate remedies. If the Applicant seeks to challenge the manner in which his grievance issues have been decided, he may bring an application for judicial review of the third level grievance decision.
Substantive Issues
[15]
If I am incorrect in concluding that this application must fail for failure by the applicant to exhaust adequate alternate remedies, I would dismiss the application on its merits for the reasons below.
Issue No. 3
: Did the CSC fail to consult with inmates when deciding to allow Home Hardware to charge mark-ups to inmates?
[16]
The applicant submits that the CSC breached its duty under s. 74 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
to provide inmates with the opportunity to contribute to the decision of the CSC that Home Hardware would be permitted to charge a mark-up on retail goods purchased by the inmate population. Section 74 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
provides:
"General - Living Conditions
. . . . .
Inmate input into decisions
"74. The Service shall provide inmates with the opportunity to contribute to decisions of the Service affecting the inmate population as a whole, or affecting a group within the inmate population, except decisions relating to security matters."
"Conditions de detention
. . . . .
Participation aux décisions
"74. Le Service doit permettre aux détenus de participer à ses décisions concernant tout ou partie de la population carcérale, sauf pour les questions de sécurité."
[17]
Counsel for the respondent has referred the Court to extensive evidence from senior CSC officers at Fenbrook that the Fenbrook Inmate Committee was extensively consulted about this practice. There is a memo in the evidence from the Chair of the Inmate Committee, dated May 8, 2000, to the Assistant Warden expressing the inmates' concern that they have to pay a mark-up over the advertised price for retail items. In the Affidavit of William Gladue, the Assistant Warden at Fenbrook, Mr. Gladue details the many dates on which he met the Inmate Committee to consult about their concerns with the Home Hardware contract.
[18]
The applicant submits that these consultations were not meaningful because Fenbrook had already entered into the contract with Home Hardware. With respect, the Home Hardware contract provides for a semi-annual negotiation of the rate of mark-up, so the input from inmates could be considered as the contract is continually renegotiated.
[19]
The Court is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that the CSC received regular input from the inmates about their concerns with the privatized inmate purchasing service. Accordingly, the CSC has not breached its duty to consult under s. 74 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
.
Issue No. 4
: Does the Court have jurisdiction to determine whether the CSC violated subsection 45(1) of the Competition
Act
?
[20]
The second substantive issue is that the applicant seeks a declaration that the Correctional Service of Canada conspired with Home Hardware to restrain competition in violation of s. 45(1) of the
Competition Act
. The respondent argues that the Federal Court has no jurisdiction to declare that a person has violated a criminal statute, particularly based on affidavit evidence in the context of a judicial review.
[21]
The respondent relies on s. 67(3) of the
Competition Act
as authority for its position:
"PART VII

. . . . .

Procedure for enforcing punishment
"67. [...]
Jurisdiction of courts
"(3) No court other than a superior court of criminal jurisdiction, as defined in the Criminal Code, has power to try any offence under section 45, 46, 47, 48 or 49."

[22]
The
Criminal Code
, in turn, defines a "superior court of criminal jurisdiction" as follows:
"INTERPRETATION

"2. In this Act, [...]
'superior court of criminal jurisdiction' means

(d) in the Provinces of New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, the Court of Appeal or the Court of Queen's Bench,
(e) in the Provinces of Nova Scotia, British Columbia and Newfoundland, the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal,
(f) in Yukon, the Supreme Court,
(g) in the Northwest Territories, the Supreme Court, and
(h) in Nunavut, the Nunavut Court of Justice;"
"DÉFINITIONS ET INTERPRÉTATION

"2. Les définitions qui suivent s'appliquent à la présente loi. [...]

c) dans la province de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard, la Cour suprême;
d) dans les provinces du Nouveau-Brunswick, du Manitoba, de la Saskatchewan et d'Alberta, la Cour d'appel ou la Cour du Banc de la Reine;

f) au Yukon, la Cour suprême;
g) dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, la Cour suprême;
h) dans le territoire du Nunavut, la Cour de justice du Nunavut."
[23]
The
Criminal Code
's exhaustive definition, which is incorporated by reference in the
Competition Act
, does not include the Federal Court. Given the combined effect of s. 67 of the
Competition Act
and s. 2 of the
Criminal Code
, the Federal Court does not have jurisdiction to try offences under s. 45 of the
Competition Act
. The proper venue for prosecuting such an offence is a provincial superior court included within the
Criminal Code
definition.
[24]
Accordingly, the Court concludes that it does not have jurisdiction to determine whether the CSC breached s. 45 of the
Competition Act
with respect to conspiring or agreeing with another person to lessen competition.
Issue No. 5
: Is the CSC's decision to allow retailers to charge mark-ups to inmates contrary to s. 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
?
[25]
The applicant also made a
Charter
argument, which the Court has determined it cannot consider on this application record. The applicant argued that the CSC's decision to allow retailers to charge mark-ups to inmates is discriminatory in its effect on Inuit inmates at Fenbrook and therefore contrary to s. 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. The thrust of his argument is that, since Fenbrook uniquely offers special programming for Inuit offenders, the imposition of a mark-up on purchases including hobbycraft items has a disproportionately adverse effect on Inuit inmates at Fenbrook in violation of the equality guarantee under s. 15 of the
Charter
. The applicant did not raise this issue in his Notice of Application and provided no evidence or analysis supporting his claim under s. 15(1). Nor has the applicant suggested that he personally suffers from discrimination, as he is not Inuit. The Court cannot render a decision on a
Charter
issue without a proper record on which to adjudicate the claim. Accordingly, the Court cannot consider the applicant's challenge of the CSC's decision based on equality grounds.
Conclusion
[26]
For the foregoing reasons, this application must be dismissed. However, as indicated at the hearing, the Court understands why the applicant and the other inmates at Fenbrook are concerned that they must pay a mark-up on some of their personal retail purchases, unlike inmates at every other federal institution. The inmates' concern is compounded by the fact that they earn very little for working in the penitentiary and thus have little disposable income.
[27]
There will be no order as to costs.
JUDGMENT
[28]
THIS COURT ADJUDGES AND DECLARES that:
This application for a declaration is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
