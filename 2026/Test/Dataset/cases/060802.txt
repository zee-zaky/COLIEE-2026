Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Layden-Stevenson, J.
: The applicant, Ms. Dupre, failed to report her possession of $53,100 (Canadian currency) to customs officials before attempting to board a flight from Vancouver International Airport to Shanghai, China. The currency was seized as forfeit for failure to report. Ms. Dupre requested a review of the seizure. A ministerial delegate determined that there were reasonable grounds to suspect the unreported currency is proceeds of crime and confirmed the forfeiture of the unreported funds.
[2]
Ms. Dupre seeks judicial review of the ministerial delegate's decision on the basis that there were no reasonable grounds to suspect, at the time of the seizure, that the funds were proceeds of crime. Alternatively, she submits that there were no reasonable grounds to suspect, at the time of the decision, that the funds were proceeds of crime. She contends that the ministerial delegate failed to assess the totality of the evidence.
[3]
For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the decision is sustainable. The ministerial delegate's conclusion that there were reasonable and probable grounds to suspect the currency is proceeds of crime is one that was reasonably open to her. Consequently, judicial intervention is not warranted and the application for judicial review must be dismissed.
The Legislation
[4]
The legislative context underlying this matter is contained in the
Proceeds of
Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17 (the Act). Among other things, the Act has as its objective the implementation of specific measures to detect and deter money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. There is no suggestion that the impugned funds were for the purpose of financing terrorist activities.
[5]
The provisions in relation to "Reporting of Currency and Monetary Instruments" are contained in Part 2 of the Act. These provisions have been interpreted and extensively discussed in the Federal Court of Appeal and Federal Court jurisprudence and need not be repeated here. See

Canada
, 2007 FC 1082 (
Majeed
);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The relevant sections of the Act are attached to these reasons as Schedule "A". At this point, suffice it to say that under subsection 12(1) of the Act, Ms. Dupre was obliged to report to Canada Customs that she was taking currency of more than $10,000 out of the country.
Facts
[6]
On December 4, 2005, customs officers were conducting currency export checks in relation to the applicant's flight to China. A currency detector dog indicated on Ms. Dupre's body and the officer approached Ms. Dupre as she was preparing to board her flight. When the officer asked her whether she was carrying any currency on her person, Ms. Dupre stated that she had "5-2-5-0". When the officer requested clarification, Ms. Dupre said "five thousand two hundred fifty dollars". The customs officer asked her to step aside.
[7]
A second customs officer arrived to conduct an examination. Ms. Dupre, dressed in a large winter coat, several sweaters and shirts, thick sweat pants and snow boots, was in a crouched position on the floor. She began searching through her hand luggage and removed her jacket. When she was asked to stand, the customs officer noticed a bulge in her abdomen area. When questioned, Ms. Dupre indicated that the bulge contained "5-2-5-0-0", "fifty-two thousand, five hundred". She then removed money from her groin area. Thereafter, she was taken to a secure area for a secondary examination.
[8]
Ms. Dupre produced three letters from three individuals indicating that each person had given her $10,000 to take to China. She explained that her brother-in-law had also provided her with $10,000. A discussion ensued regarding her employment during which Ms. Dupre indicated that she had quit a beautician's job in 2005. Because Ms. Dupre was in possession of an internet article regarding a crackdown on illegal "rub and tug" massage parlours, the officer asked whether she had worked in massage parlours. Ms. Dupre responded that she had not. Yet, in her possession were documents indicating that charges of operating a body parlour without a licence had been laid against one Mr. Venot, as an owner, and Ms. Dupre, as an operator. Also in her possession, and in her name, were two burlesque-entertainer licences from the City of Toronto, a holistic practitioner licence and Shiatsu masseuse certification. Ms. Dupre ultimately admitted to not having worked as a beautician since 2003, to being an occasional exotic dancer at various strip clubs, to being heavily in debt, and to being "poor and unemployed". At the end of the examination, four bundles of money totalling $53,100 were seized as forfeit.
[9]
Ms. Dupre was served with a notice of the circumstances of the seizure. In accordance with her right under section 25 of the Act, Ms. Dupre requested a decision from the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) of the Act had been contravened. This request was acknowledged by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and forwarded to a CBSA adjudicator in the CBSA Adjudications Division. Ms. Dupre was invited to furnish any evidence she wished to submit.
[10]
Ms. Dupre forwarded correspondence and representations which included: declarations from Ms. Dupre, Messrs. Stan Giri, Pierre Venot and Daniel Dupre (her husband) and her sister. All were to the effect that funds had been provided to Ms. Dupre to take to China. In the case of the gentlemen, the funds were for an investment opportunity in China and in the case of her sister, the funds were for delivery to family members. Her husband allegedly provided additional funds to repay a loan to Ms. Dupre's brother-in-law.
[11]
Ms. Dupre submitted photographs of the Canada Immigration office at the Vancouver International Airport, a number of business documents and photocopies of her sister's passport and birth certificate. She claimed to have misunderstood "Customer Service" to be the area where she had to declare the currency and she provided an account of her efforts to report the currency in compliance with the Act. Further, she stated that during her interviews with the various customs officials, she had advised them that she did not understand their questions because her English was poor. She indicated that she did not know why a Chinese interpreter had not been provided to assist her. Subsequent submissions included documents relating to the financial circumstances of Messrs. Venot, Giri and Dupre, her brother-in-law, Ben Y Liu, and her sister.
[12]
The adjudicator received comments from the seizing officer in response to Ms. Dupre's submissions. Among other things, the seizing officer related that Ms. Dupre was aware of the reporting requirement and that her English language skills were adequate. If language had been an issue, translators were available on site and could have been called. The seizing officer also noted that Ms. Dupre's submissions did not address the issue of the origin of the impugned currency. Further, no financial documents had been submitted for the portion of the currency that was stated to belong to Ms. Dupre.
[13]
Three further sets of submissions were tendered by Ms. Dupre between October 10th and December 5th of 2006. Final comments from the seizing officer were provided on December 17th.
[14]
On January 23, 2007, the adjudicator completed a case synopsis and reasons for decision (the case synopsis). This document contained an extensive recapitulation of Ms. Dupre's submissions and the seizing officer's comments.
[15]
The adjudicator noted that an officer need only "suspect" that the currency is proceeds of crime. She listed a number of factors supporting the officer's decision to seize the currency. For instance, the documents on Ms. Dupre's person at the time of seizure indicated that one of the individuals for whom she was transporting money was charged for owning a body rub parlour where Ms. Dupre had also worked and could still be occupied, given her current employment as an exotic dancer; Ms. Dupre had taken careful measures to conceal the currency in that she had sewn it into her undergarments and hidden it under her clothing; the currency was bundled in a format not normally used by financial institutions; and Ms. Dupre did not provide: consistent or helpful evidence of the legitimate sources of the funds; any evidence as to its original source; consistent explanations about the nature of the business venture; or any documents providing evidence of the proposed investment.
[16]
The adjudicator concluded that there had been a contravention of the Act with respect to the amount of $47,850, but no contravention with respect to $5,250. She recommended that $5,250 be returned to Ms. Dupre pursuant to section 27 of the Act and that $47,850 be held as forfeit under section 29 of the Act. These conclusions were forwarded to the ministerial delegate as a recommendation. The ministerial delegate was also provided with the case synopsis and Ms. Dupre's submissions.
[17]
By correspondence dated April 24, 2007, the ministerial delegate informed Ms. Dupre that there had been a contravention of subsection 12(1) of the Act. More specifically, the ministerial delegate determined, pursuant to section 27, that with respect to $5,250, there had been no contravention and that "under section 28 of the [Act], the seized currency in the amount of $5.250 be returned to the appellant". Pursuant to section 27, there had been a contravention in relation to $47,850 and "under the provisions of section 29 of the [Act], I am authorizing that the seized currency in the amount of $47,850 be held as forfeit". In her reasons, the ministerial delegate identified the following factors:
• Ms. Dupre had failed to report the currency despite having many opportunities to do so;
• she attempted to conceal the currency;
• she was transporting a large amount of currency over an international border;
• the money was not bundled in accordance with normal banking procedures;
• Ms. Dupre was unaware of the amount of money she possessed;
• there were discrepancies in the amounts of money provided by other parties;
• usually such a large amount of money would be wired or transferred to a company in this type of business venture;
• there were no supporting documents to prove the money was destined for the business in China;
• a legitimate business would keep a record of funds for tax purposes and such documents were absent in this case;
• Ms. Dupre possessed documents indicating several bank accounts and credit and debit cards for other individuals;
• she was uncooperative during the second examination.
It is the ministerial delegate's decision of April 24th that is the subject of this application for judicial review.
The Standard of Review
[18]
The respondent submits that the applicable standard of review is that of patent unreasonableness. The applicant is content to rely on the respondent's submissions in this respect. There is divergence in the jurisprudence as to the standard of review to be applied to a decision pursuant to section 29 of the Act. The standard of patent unreasonableness has been applied ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Tourki 2
) as has the standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Dag
). Justice Phelan recently commented in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the distinction in the cases turns on the facts and issues in each case and particularly the extent to which the expertise of the decision-maker is utilized.
[19]
In this case, as in the others, there is a strong privative clause in section 24 of the Act. This factor favours deference.
[20]
As for expertise, the ministerial delegate concluded that Ms. Dupre had failed to provide a reasonable explanation as to the source of the impugned funds. Although credibility was an issue, the principal basis underlying the determination was the question regarding the source of the funds. Thus, the assessment required an analysis of the evidence relative to the legal threshold prescribed by the Act, an area where the decision-maker has greater expertise than the court. This factor also favours deference.
[21]
The purpose of the Act, in part and for present purposes, is to detect and deter money laundering. To achieve this objective, the currency reporting scheme requires importers and exporters of currency to report to customs officials when they are importing or exporting currency or monetary instruments in excess of $10,000. As Madam Justice Simpson stated in
Sellathuai
, Parliament has mandated serious sanctions, including forfeiture, in the event that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the undeclared currency is proceeds of crime. Parliament has balanced the private and public interests in enacting the legislation. The role of the ministerial delegate is narrow and is confined to determining whether, on the facts of a particular case, forfeiture should be confirmed. This does not suggest a deferential approach. Justice Simpson's reasoning has been generally adopted by my colleagues and I endorse it and accept it as my own.
[22]
Regarding the nature of the question, it is one of mixed fact and law because it requires the ministerial delegate to assess whether the evidence discloses reasonable grounds to suspect that the currency is proceeds of crime. The "legal" threshold is prescribed by the Act. This factor militates in favour of some deference.
[23]
In balancing these factors, I arrive at a standard of review of reasonableness.
Analysis
Reasonable Grounds to Suspect at the Time of Seizure
[24]
Ms. Dupre claims that she made a full declaration to the dog-handling customs officer and made every attempt to make a full disclosure. She was hampered from doing so by the lack of signage at the Vancouver International Airport and became confused between "Customer Service" and "Customs Service". Additionally, her English skills were poor. She clarified her original declaration of "5-2-5-0" to fifty-two thousand, five hundred dollars. She was hindered by a difficulty expressing numbers in English. At the time, she had no motive to misstate the amount of money in her possession or to state the specific amount of $5,250 over any other amount under $10,000.
[25]
In substance, this argument constitutes a request to review the issue of contravention of the Act. Such review - whether there was a contravention under subsection 12(1) of the Act - is made pursuant to section 27 of the Act. There exists a section 27 decision in this case. Ms. Dupre has a statutory right of appeal available to her in relation to the section 27 determination. If she wishes to contest the contravention finding, she must do so under the appeal process contained in section 30 of the Act:
Dokaj, Tourki
. I have no jurisdiction, on judicial review, to deal with the matter of contravention. The appropriate procedure to be followed in this regard was clearly enunciated in the ministerial delegate's correspondence of April 24, 2007. Ms. Dupre cannot succeed on this front.
Reasonable Grounds to Suspect at the Time of Decision
[26]
Ms. Dupre contends that her submissions and documentation were sufficient to dispel any suspicion that the currency she carried was proceeds of crime. She notes specifically:
• She did not avoid opportunities to report the currency. Rather, she sought to make a report and was "impeded" from so doing. In any event, the failure to report does not constitute a reasonable suspicion that the money is proceeds of crime;
• She did not conceal the money; it was in heavy clothing that was necessary, given the cold weather, for protection;
• Carrying a large sum of money over an international border is legal when reported and should not form the basis of a reasonable suspicion;
• A lack of detail was the result of her poor English skills and the officer "mixing" some of her own currency with the money around her waist;
• To say that money for business purposes would normally be transferred or wired is not an objective conclusion. Moreover, the language used by the officer acknowledges that this is not a hard and fast rule;
• She is not a business person and it was easier to carry the money. Because this is a legitimate means of transferring money, no negative inference should be drawn, particularly where not all of the money is destined for a business purpose;
• She provided documentary evidence of the company in China including a letter of intent. The officer sought further evidence of a joint venture. Such evidence could have been provided only when the company received cash payments from the investors;
• The absence of any records for tax purposes is understandable since the investment monies were never delivered to China;
• A number of letters, including statutory declarations from two individuals, were provided to demonstrate that the money was for investment purposes;
• She did not have the opportunity to address the ministerial delegate's concern about her possession of documents indicating bank accounts and credit and debit cards of others because this concern only appeared in the final decision;
• She was not uncooperative during the second examination.
[27]
Ms. Dupre claims that the ministerial delegate has created an impossible burden whereby she could dispel the reasonable grounds to suspect only by demonstrating that the money in her possession was not derived from any crimes. Further, she points to "inconsistencies" between the seizing officer's handwritten notes and her narrative report.
[28]
Distilled, most of these criticisms come within three categories. The allegations regarding efforts to report, the concealment of the currency and poor English skills relate to the issue of contravention. As noted above, the contravention determination must be challenged by way of an appeal. However, to the extent that these factors may have contributed to the ministerial delegate's conclusion of reasonable grounds to suspect the $47,850 constitute proceeds of crime, some further observations are in order.
[29]
First, although Ms. Dupre suggests that she attempted to report the currency and was unable to locate the Customs Office, she failed to approach an officer to make her declaration when she could have done so. Second, Ms. Dupre attempted to conceal her work history. Further, her declared income was less than $20,000 in 2004 and she claimed to have no income in 2005. Notwithstanding, she claimed that some of the money belonged to her. Third, the ministerial delegate acknowledged that the weather was cold but considered that Ms. Dupre was nonetheless overdressed. Moreover, the money was sewn into her undergarments. Fourth, the seizing officer indicated that Ms. Dupre's English skills were adequate and that interpreters were on site, if required. The officer did not see the need for an interpreter nor did Ms. Dupre request one. In any event, Ms. Dupre has had ample opportunity to explain any omissions and inconsistencies through her submissions.
[30]
The allegations regarding the legality of transporting reported currency over international borders are not disputed. Notably, however, Ms. Dupre's account of the event is totally at odds with the observations of the seizing officer and the notes and narrative that were prepared contemporaneously with the incident. Ms. Dupre's submissions exhibit a total disregard for the fact that she did not report the funds before being apprehended. Further, she fails to acknowledge the various inconsistencies in her own evidence and she does not appear to recognize that the origin of the funds remains a problem.
[31]
Most of the remaining contentions relate to the Chinese investment to which the bulk of the currency was ostensibly destined. Ms. Dupre relies heavily on the statutory declarations from Messrs. Giri and Venot to establish that the money was for the purpose of an investment. At this point, it is important to recognize that while the destination of the money was of concern, it was the source of the money which presented the more significant problem. The declarations do not establish the source of the funds allegedly provided by the individuals. Generally, they state simply that the individuals furnished specific sums of money to Ms. Dupre. In the case of those individuals who claimed to have sufficient means to have provided the currency, the information did not demonstrate the lawful origin of the funds in question.
[32]
In any event, even if the declarations are taken at face value, the ministerial delegate relied upon other factors to conclude that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the currency is proceeds of crime.
[33]
The ministerial delegate did not suggest that the alleged investment could be conducted only by wire transfer. The question as to why the payment was not by way of cheque or money order was legitimate. As for the "seizure" preventing the company in China from issuing any record or receipt of contract, the ministerial delegate simply found that it was unlikely that an international company would enter into a business venture without any documentation prior to the receipt of monies.
[34]
The documents regarding the company in China did not address the origin of the funds. Additionally, the record contains a number of inconsistencies regarding the nature of that business. At the second examination, Ms. Dupre stated that she had no idea about the investment for which the money was destined. Subsequently, she explained that the investment was for an internet business. Later documents, tendered with submissions, indicate that the company is a powder company. Further, the amounts that her husband and associates intended to invest were identical to the amounts that Ms. Dupre ostensibly was transporting for family members, a fact that was rightly regarded as suspicious. Despite repeated references throughout the record regarding the significance of the source of the money (disclosed to Ms. Dupre), the issue of source was not adequately addressed.
[35]
This leaves two remaining contentions. Both can be disposed of summarily. In relation to the accounts and cards, Ms. Dupre was well aware of the credit and debit cards belonging to other persons in her possession. It was open to her to explain why she held them at any time. The invitation to submit any evidence that she wished was open-ended. The allegation of inconsistencies between the seizing officer's notes and narrative is nothing other than an exercise in minutia. For instance, it is inconsequential whether the officer noticed the bulge around Ms. Dupre's waist before or after Ms. Dupre pointed to her waist.
[36]
It is important to recall that this is an administrative proceeding
in rem
. It concerns only the forfeited currency and whether there were reasonable grounds to suspect that it is proceeds of crime. The jurisprudence of this Court establishes that focus on the source of the currency is appropriate.
[37]
Reasonable grounds to suspect is a lesser but included standard of reasonable and probable grounds to believe:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In my view, in the circumstances, there was ample reason to suspect that the currency in Ms. Dupre's possession is proceeds of crime. Ms. Dupre created that suspicion by her conduct at the time of the seizure.
[38]
The onus then shifted to Ms. Dupre to dispel the suspicion. To accomplish that end, she had to persuade the ministerial delegate as to the lawful source of the funds. The imposition of this requirement is logical given that Ms. Dupre is best-placed to explain the origin of the currency that was in her possession. She simply failed to meet that onus.
[39]
There is no merit to the allegation that Ms. Dupre's various submissions were not considered. They were considered but, in the final analysis, they were found to be unpersuasive and most were rejected.
[40]
The ministerial delegate's decision withstands the scrutiny of a somewhat probing examination. It is not my function to re-weigh the evidence. Accordingly, there is no basis for my intervention.
