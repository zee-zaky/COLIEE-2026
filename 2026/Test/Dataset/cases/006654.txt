Layden-Stevenson, J.
: The question to be answered in this case is whether the Federal Court has jurisdiction under s. 30 of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17 (the
Act
) to review a ministerial decision made under s. 29 of the
Act
. I have concluded that the answer is no because the
Act
does not vest the Federal Court with appellate jurisdiction to review a s. 29 ministerial decision.
[2]
The defendant, by notice of motion under Rule 220 of the
Federal Courts Rules, 1998
, SOR/98-106, and on consent of the plaintiff, sought an order directing the determination of a question of law. Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer, by Order dated March 24, 2005, granted the request.
FACTS
[3]
The parties submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts. A copy of that document is attached to these reasons as Schedule "A". For context, a recitation of the pertinent facts is set out here.
[4]
The plaintiff, Mr. Dokaj, is a Canadian citizen. On October 16, 2003, he was scheduled to travel from Dorval Airport (as it then was) in Montreal to Athens, Greece en route to Albania. At the time, he was in possession of approximately $25,950 in U.S. currency and $400 in Canadian funds. When asked by customs officials if he had in his possession more than $10,000 he answered that he did not. Customs officials, upon searching Mr. Dokaj, discovered the aforementioned currency in his wallet, coat pocket, and luggage. A customs officer seized the money and provided him with a "Customs Seizure Receipt".
[5]
Mr. Dokaj requested that the Minister review the seizure of the monies. The ministerial delegate, in correspondence dated March 16, 2004, rendered the following decision:
“After considering all of the circumstances, I have decided, under s. 27 of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, that there has been a contravention in respect of the currency which was seized.
Under s. 29 of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, the seized currency is held as forfeit.”
The ministerial delegate enclosed, in the correspondence, a copy of ss. 26, 27 and 30 of the
Act
and commented "[y]ou may find this information helpful should you wish to appeal this decision".
[6]
Mr. Dokaj initiated an appeal by way of action by issuing a statement of claim, pursuant to s. 30 of the
Act
, and requested monetary relief equal to the value of the seized currency less a penalty of $2,500. Mr. Dokaj admits, in the statement of claim, that he failed to declare the currency to the customs officials. He alleges that the ministerial delegate erred in law because she: (a) "failed to investigate the source of the currency as documented by the solicitor acting for the plaintiff"; and (b) "failed to consider alternatives to forfeiture without terms of release pursuant to s. 18(2) of the [
Act
]".
[7]
The defendant Minister moved to strike the statement of claim on the basis that the Court's jurisdiction, under s. 30 of the
Act
, is limited to reviewing the s. 27 decision and it is without jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of a s. 29 decision. A prothonotary concluded that the answer to the question was not plain and obvious and accordingly dismissed the motion. The prothonotary suggested that the proper procedure for adjudication would be a motion to determine a question of law. Hence, the Minister moved under Rule 220 and the Order of Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer issued.
ISSUE
[8]
The sole issue is the determination of the question: "Does the Federal Court have jurisdiction pursuant to s. 30 of the [
Act
] to review a ministerial decision issued pursuant to s. 29 of the
Act
?"
THE RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS
[9]

THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
[10]
The Minister takes the position that the Federal Court's jurisdiction under s. 30 is limited to considering the s. 27 decision. Consequently, the Court is without jurisdiction to deal with an appeal of the s. 29 decision.
[11]
Mr. Dokaj contends that the Federal Court's appellate jurisdiction under s. 30(1) must necessarily include jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision made under s. 29 of the
Act
.
THE ARGUMENTS
[12]
The Minister's argument is two-pronged. First, based on a contextual approach to statutory interpretation, the right of appeal to the Federal Court contained in s. 30 of the
Act
cannot reasonably be extended to include the Minister's decision as to sanction for a violation of s. 12(1) of the
Act
. Section 30 provides that a person who requests a decision of the Minister under s. 25 may appeal the Minister's decision. Section 25, in turn, refers to requesting a review for "a decision of the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) was contravened". The appeal provided for in s. 30 therefore relates solely to s. 12(1). That subsection creates the obligation to report the importation or exportation of currency or monetary instruments of a value equal to or greater than the prescribed amount.
[13]
Put another way, an individual who contravenes s. 12(1) may, under s. 25, request a ministerial review. However, the provision for review (as specifically stipulated in s. 25) relates to s. 12(1). The Minister must render a decision as to whether s. 12(1) was contravened. An appeal lies to the Federal Court with respect to the Minister's decision by virtue of s. 30, but that section specifically stipulates that the appeal is with respect to a s. 25 review. Approached from either direction, the result is the same. The appeal provided for in s. 30 is concerned with a "contravention" of s. 12(1).
[14]
The Minister bolsters this argument by reference to the
Customs Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (2nd Supp.). It was Parliament's intention, according to the Minister, to institute an appeal mechanism harmonized with the
Customs Act
, an analogous statute with strikingly similar review mechanisms. Moreover, the administration and enforcement of the
Act
was entrusted to the same customs officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the
Customs Act
.
[15]
For example, both statutes allow an individual, from whom goods are seized by a customs official for contravention of the statute in question, to request a ministerial decision as to whether a contravention occurred. Additionally, when the Minister decides that either of the respective statutes has been contravened, a determination is made as to whether the sanction imposed by the customs official is appropriate. The Minister asserts that under the
Customs Act
, the second decision cannot be challenged by means of a statutory appeal to the Federal Court pursuant to s. 135 of the
Customs Act
or otherwise.
[16]
The Minister points to several instances where the Federal Court has concluded that its jurisdiction on a s. 135
Customs Act
statutory appeal is limited to determining whether or not there has been a contravention of the
Customs Act
that would justify the seizure. The Court is precluded from dealing with any other issues on such statutory appeals including reviews of decisions rendered by the Minister in relation to sanctions. Rather, the recourse available to a person who disagrees with the penalty imposed for contravening the
Customs Act
is an application for judicial review under s. 18 of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. The Minister urges the Court to interpret the
Act
as it has interpreted the
Customs Act
and confirm that a statutory appeal under s. 30 of the
Act
is limited to a consideration of the Minister's s. 27 decision that the
Act
was contravened for failure to report the seized currency. It is not permissible to add words where there is an acceptable interpretation without reading in words.
[17]
Mr. Dokaj claims that while the Minister's submissions regarding similarity between the two statutes are attractive, they are superficial and constitute an elevation of form over substance. The frailties include: a lack of regard to the effect of such decisions for citizens; resort to analogies that invite a review of the similarities between the statutes without consideration of the differences; and a failure to appreciate that the intention of Parliament is presumed to be based on reason and logic. Section 30 of the
Act
should be interpreted as being applicable to both s. 27 and s. 29 because both constitute the same decision.
[18]
In Mr. Dokaj's view, once the Minister has determined that there has been a contravention of s. 12(1), the Minister must, of necessity, proceed to s. 29 to determine what sanction is to be imposed (the presumption being the return of the currency less any penalty unless there is a finding that the funds are proceeds of crime or of terrorist activity).
[19]
Construction in a strict grammatical sense, says Mr. Dokaj, is based on the presumption that the statute was drafted properly to achieve parliamentary purpose. While the legislative text is the source from which parliamentary intent is most likely inferred, the Court must look not to the text, but to the meaning of the statute. It is open to the Court to import words so long as it does not add to what is already implied by the statute. Parliament could not reasonably have intended two different mechanisms of review flowing from the same decision under s. 12(1). If two reasonable interpretations can be found, the Court should adopt that which is more logical.
[20]
Mr. Dokaj argues that where an obvious conflict exists between the letter and the spirit of the law, the court should undertake to interpret logically to give effect to legislative intent and override those written expressions incompatible with the purpose of the law. Moreover, s. 24, the review provision of the
Act
, precludes review except as provided in ss. 25 to 29. This, he says, is indicative of Parliament's intent to include both ss. 27 and 29 under the statutory right of appeal in s. 30. Since a s. 29 decision, of necessity, flows from s. 27, the two cannot be separated because the second decision is mandated by the making of the first decision. The two are inextricably intertwined and the appeal process must encompass all logical and correlative decision-making that follows from it.
[21]
Regarding the Minister's position that the
Act
should be interpreted in the same manner as the
Customs Act
, Mr. Dokaj submits that to do so would be improper. The two statutes are similar in structure, but not in purpose. For instance, under the
Customs Act
, goods seized are automatically forfeited making it logical to preclude a review of penalty. In contrast, the
Act
does not entail automatic forfeiture; it requires return of the funds unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the funds flow from terrorist activities or are proceeds of crime. Section 23 of the
Act
must be read in conjunction with s. 18(2). The penultimate distinction between the
Customs Act
and the
Act
, according to Mr. Dokaj, is that under the former a penalty is purely discretionary whereas the latter dictates mandatory return unless s. 18(2) is put into play.
[22]
Mr. Dokaj contends that the Minister's interpretation results in a cumbersome and complex review mechanism whereby a person, from whom funds have been seized (who wishes to have the decision reviewed), must engage in two different proceedings on substantially the same facts.
ANALYSIS
[23]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 1; 271 W.A.C. 1, Mr. Justice Iacobucci, at paragraphs 26 to 29, discussed the principles of statutory interpretation. Those paragraphs (citations omitted) state:
“26 In Elmer Dridger's definitive formulation, found at p. 87 of his
Construction of Statutes
(2nd Ed. 1983):
‘Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.’
Driedger's modern approach has been repeatedly cited by this Court as the preferred approach to statutory interpretation across a wide range of interpretive settings: ... I note as well that, in the federal legislative context, this Court's preferred approach is buttressed by s. 12 of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, which provides that every enactment ‘is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects’.
“27 The preferred approach recognizes the important role that context must inevitably play when a court construes the written words of a statute: as Professor John Willis incisively noted in his seminal article
Statute Interpretation in a Nutshell
(1938), 16 Can. Bar Rev. 1, at p. 6, ‘words, like [page 581] people, take their colour from their surroundings’. This being the case, where the provision under consideration is found in an Act that is itself a component of a larger statutory scheme, the surroundings that colour the words and the scheme of the Act are more expansive. In such an instance, the application of Driedger's principle gives rise to what was described in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 52, as ‘the principle of interpretation that presumes a harmony, coherence, and consistency between statutes dealing with the same subject matter’...
“28 Other principles of interpretation -- such as the strict construction of penal statutes and the ‘
Charter
values’ presumption -- only receive application where there is ambiguity as to the meaning of a provision ...
“29 What, then, in law is an ambiguity? To answer, an ambiguity must be ‘real’ ... The words of the provision must be ‘reasonably capable of more than one meaning’ ... By necessity, however, one must consider the ‘entire context’ of a provision before one can determine if it is reasonably capable of multiple interpretations. In this regard, Major, J.’s, statement in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 14, is apposite: ‘It is only when genuine ambiguity arises between two or more plausible readings,
each equally in accordance with the intentions of the statute
, that the courts need to resort to external interpretive aids’ (emphasis added), to which I would add, ‘including other principles of interpretation’.”
[24]
Guided by these principles, I turn to the
Act
which is the result of an initiative that is not unique to Canada. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), of which Canada is a member, is comprised of approximately 40 nations (all of them industrialized). FATF is committed to addressing, among other things, the sharing of information in relation to transnational crime. The
Act
received Royal Assent on June 29, 2000, and many of its provisions have been introduced piecemeal.
[25]
The objectives of the
Act
are set out in s. 3 therein and include the following:
“(a) to implement specific measures to detect and deter money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities and to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of money laundering offences and terrorist activity financing offences, including ...
(ii) requiring the reporting of suspicious financial transactions and of cross-border movements of currency and monetary instruments.
(b) to respond to the threat posed by organized crime by providing law enforcement officials with the information they need to deprive criminals of the proceeds of their criminal activities, while ensuring that appropriate safeguards are put in place to protect the privacy of persons with respect to personal information about themselves; and
(c) to assist in fulfilling Canada's international commitments to participate in the fight against transnational crime, particularly money laundering, and the fight against terrorist activity.”
[26]
Of particular concern, here, is the objective stipulated in sub-paragraph 3(a)(ii). Implementation of this objective was to have been achieved through Part 2 of the
Act
which provides for a currency reporting regime whereby importers and exporters of currency must make a report to a customs official whenever they import or export large quantities of currency or monetary instruments into or out of Canada. Part 2 of the
Act
became effective with the coming into force of the
Cross-border Currency and Monetary Instruments Reporting Regulations
, SOR/2002-412 (the
Cross-border Regulations
) on January 6, 2003. The relevant reporting requirements in this case (involving the exportation of currency) stem from s. 12(1) and paragraph 12(3)(a) of the
Act
in conjunction with ss. 2, 3, and 11 of the
Cross-border Regulations
. These provisions require every person who exports, from Canada, currency or monetary instruments worth $10,000 or more to report this exportation to a customs official.
[27]
When reports are made with respect to cross-border movements of currency or monetary instruments in excess of $10,000, the reports are forwarded to the Financial Transaction Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) which apparently possesses expertise in tracking and analysing international currency and monetary instruments transfers. If patterns appear, FINTRAC may become suspicious that the funds constitute "dirty" money in which case information may be passed on to a law enforcement agency.
[28]
Notably, the
Act
does not prohibit the transporting of large amounts of currency. Rather, it requires that amounts exceeding $10,000 be reported. The obligation to report arises in all cases, i.e. whether the money is "dirty" or otherwise.
[29]
The scheme in relation to the transporting of more than $10,000 of currency or monetary instruments is contained in ss. 12 through 39 of the
Act
and in the
Cross-border Regulations
. In circumstances where a person exports from Canada currency worth more than $10,000 and fails to report the exportation, s. 18(1) of the
Act
provides that the currency is subject to seizure as forfeit, by a customs officer, if the customs officer believes on reasonable grounds that s. 12(1) of the
Act
has been contravened. By virtue of s. 18(2) of the
Act
, the customs officer must return the seized currency or monetary instruments less the prescribed penalty (which ranges from $250 to $5,000 under s. 18 of the
Cross-border Regulations
) unless the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the currency is proceeds of crime or funds for terrorist financing.
[30]
Section 23 of the
Act
stipulates that (subject to return under s. 18(2) and the review provisions of ss. 25 to 31) currency seized as forfeit under s. 18(1) is automatically forfeited to Her Majesty in Right of Canada from the time of the contravention in respect of which it was seized and no act or proceeding after the forfeiture is necessary to effect the forfeiture.
[31]
Section 25 of the
Act
permits either the person from whom the currency was seized or the lawful owner of the currency to request a decision of the Minister [see footnote 1] as to whether s. 12(1) of the
Act
was contravened, provided such a request is made in writing within 90 days after the date of the seizure. If such a request is made, the Commissioner [see footnote 2] is obliged to serve that person with written notice of the circumstances of the seizure, pursuant to s. 26(1) of the
Act
. The person is then entitled, under s. 26(2), to provide any evidence in the matter that he or she wishes to submit provided that the evidence is tendered within 30 days of receiving the Commissioner's written notice.
[32]
The Minister is required, under s. 27 of the
Act
, to make a decision with respect to whether s. 12(1) of the
Act
was contravened. If the Minister decides that there was no failure to report, the currency or the assessed penalty must be returned to the person, pursuant to s. 28 of the
Act
. If, on the other hand, the Minister decides that there was a failure to report, the Minister will, under s. 29 of the
Act
, determine the appropriate sanction for the infraction, including whether to confirm the forfeiture (where the customs officer has determined that the currency or monetary instruments constitute proceeds of crime or terrorist financing).
[33]
Section 30 of the
Act
permits the person who requested a decision of the Minister to appeal that decision by way of an action in the Federal Court. The narrow issue is which decision is appealable, the s. 27 decision, the s. 29 decision, or both.
[34]
With respect, I do not share Mr. Dokaj's view that a decision under s. 27 and a decision under s. 29 constitute the "same decision". A reading of the provisions simply does not support such an interpretation. Section 27 requires nothing more and nothing less than for the Minister to decide whether s. 12(1) was contravened. The fact that an affirmative response precipitates a review of the penalty which, in turn, results in another determination does not convert the two decisions into a single determination.
[35]
The decisions of the Minister pursuant to ss. 27 and 29 are discrete decisions. One deals with contravention; the other deals with penalty and forfeit. Section 27 stipulates that the Minister shall decide whether s. 12(1), i.e. the requirement to report, was contravened. The wording is unequivocal and leaves no room for doubt. Section 29 provides that, in circumstances where the Minister determines that there was a failure to report, the Minister is to review the quantum of the sanction imposed by the customs official under s. 18(2), i.e. full forfeiture or a penalty ranging from $250 to $5,000. The Minister will either confirm the customs official's determination with respect to sanction or reduce it to some lesser penalty.
[36]
What then of the appeal procedure provided for in s. 30 of the
Act
? I share the Minister's view that the section provides for a statutory appeal in relation to the determination made under s. 27. It does not permit an appeal of a decision made under s. 29. For ease of reference, s. 30(1), s. 25 and s. 27(1) are again reproduced. The emphasis is mine.
“30(1) A person who requests
a decision of the Minister under section 25
may, within 90 days after being notified of
the decision
, appeal
the decision
by way of an action in the Federal Court in which the person is the plaintiff and the Minister is the defendant.
“25. A person from whom currency or monetary instruments were seized under section 18, or the lawful owner of the currency or monetary instruments, may within 90 days after the date of the seizure request
a decision of the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) was contravened
, by giving notice in writing to the officer who seized the currency or monetary instruments or to an officer at the customs office closest to the place where the seizure took place.
“27(1) Within 90 days after the expiry of the period referred to in subsection 26(2),
the Minister shall decide whether subsection 12(1) was contravened
.”
“30(1) La personne qui a présenté
une demande en vertu de l'article 25
peut, dans les quatre-vingt-dix jours suivant la communication de
la décision
, en appeler par voie d'action devant la Cour fédérale à titre de demandeur, le ministre étant le défendeur.
“25. La personne entre les mains de qui ont été saisis des espèces ou effets en vertu de l'article 18 ou leur propriétaire légitime peut, dans les quatre-vingt-dix jours suivant la saisie, demander
au ministre de décider s'il y a eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1)
en donnant un avis écrit à l'agent qui les a saisis ou à un agent du bureau de douane le plus proche du lieu de la saisie.
“27(1) Dans les quatre-vingt-dix jours qui suivent l'expiration du délai mentionné au paragraphe 26(2),
le ministre décide s'il y a eu contravention au paragraphe 12(1)
.”
[37]
There is no ambiguity in the language. The
Act
authorizes an appeal in relation to a decision of the Minister under s. 25. Section 25 relates only to a decision as to whether s. 12(1) was contravened (the provision that imposes the obligation to report). It necessarily follows that the references to "a decision" and "the decision" in s. 30(1) refer to the Minister's determination under s. 27 of the
Act
. In my view, it cannot reasonably be construed in any other way. Consequently, the Federal Court's jurisdiction, pursuant to s. 30 of the
Act
, is limited to reviewing the decision under s. 27 of the
Act
. That decision is with respect to whether or not there was a contravention of the
Act
under s. 12(1).
[38]
While other ministerial decisions taken in the context of a seizure under the
Act
, such as a decision under s. 29, may be the subject of judicial review applications initiated under s. 18 of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, they cannot be the subject of a statutory appeal brought pursuant to s. 30 of the
Act
. Section 24 of the
Act
constitutes a strong privative clause that insulates, but does not immunize, decisions (other than those under s. 27) from judicial review. Indeed the Minister takes the position that judicial review of such decisions is available and the existence and ambit of the privative clause is to be assessed in the consideration of the factors comprising the pragmatic and functional analysis. (see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[39]
I agree with Mr. Dokaj that the result is one that is both awkward and inconvenient. I disagree, though, with his thesis that Parliament could not reasonably have intended two different mechanisms of review regarding the same decision. First, I have determined that the decisions are discrete. Second, I have concluded that the interpretation of the provision in question yields the result that Parliament's intention was to restrict the statutory appeal to decisions made under s. 27 of the
Act
. Third, even in circumstances where the result can be viewed as unfair, if such a result is contemplated by the legislation, it does not displace Parliament's intent:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[40]
My conclusion in this respect is supported by reference to the jurisprudence dealing with the analogous seizure review and appeal mechanism provided in the
Customs Act
. The similarity between the seizure review and appeal mechanism contained in the
Act
and that contained in the
Customs Act
is readily apparent. Specifically, the sections concord as follows: s. 12 of the
Act
with s. 12 of the
Customs Act
; s. 18 of the
Act
with ss. 110 and 117 of the
Customs Act
; s. 23 of the
Act
with s. 122 of the
Customs Act
; s. 24 of the
Act
with s. 123 of the
Customs Act
; s. 25 of the
Act
with s. 129 of the
Customs Act
; s. 26 of the
Act
with s. 130 of the
Customs Act
; s. 27 of the
Act
with s. 131 of the
Customs Act
; s. 28 of the
Act
with s. 132 of the
Customs Act
; s. 29 of the
Act
with s. 133 of the
Customs Act
; and s. 30 of the
Act
with s. 135 of the
Customs Act
.
[41]
A review of these provisions indicates that Parliament intended that the seizure review and appeal mechanisms in the
Act
mirror and complement those found in the
Customs Act
so that the two regimes can operate harmoniously. The same basic scheme is to apply in relation to both
Act
s. It is also notable that Parliament entrusted the administration and enforcement of the cross-border currency reporting regime in the
Act
to the same customs officials who are assigned and experienced with the administration and enforcement of the "goods reporting regime" in the
Customs Act
.
[42]
The Federal Court has concluded that its jurisdiction on a s. 135
Customs Act
statutory appeal is confined to determining whether there has been a contravention of the
Customs Act
that would justify the seizure. The Court is precluded from dealing with any other issues on such statutory appeals, including reviews of decisions rendered by the Minister in relation to sanctions. An individual who disagrees with the sanction imposed for contravening the
Customs Act
must resort to s. 18 of the
Federal Courts Act
:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 736 (T.D.);
Time  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), affd. (1997), 211 N.R. 229 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).
[43]
Mr. Justice MacKay,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Canada Inc
., supra, opined as follows:
“I note in passing that, if my interpretation of the
Act
is correct, there is an anomalous situation presented for anyone seeking to question the Minister's decisions in relation to seizures and forfeitures. The
Act
provides for an appeal of a decision of the Minister on the issue of whether there has been a contravention of the
Act
or regulations and such an appeal may be made by way of an action in this court within 90 days of notice of the decision. The exercise of discretion in imposing the penalty, like any other administrative discretion, even where there is a privative clause, is subject to judicial review in this court, but since amendments to the
Federal Court Act
effective February 1, 1992, relief must be sought by an application for judicial review, not by an action, to be commenced within 30 days of the decision sought to be reviewed, unless the court grants an extension of time to apply. The person affected by Customs seizures and penalties can only be confused by the two remedial processes Parliament has now provided under the two statutes. Parliament might well consider whether both decisions of the Minister, under ss. 131 and 133, should be subject to review in a single proceeding, by way of an appeal or on application for judicial review.”
[44]
Justice MacKay's invitation to Parliament was extended in 1993. The
Customs Act
has not been modified. When Parliament adopted the
Act
, some seven years later, it had the opportunity to create a single statutory appeal for decisions rendered under ss. 27 and 29 of the
Act
, if it so desired, but it chose otherwise. That choice, having been taken by Parliament, must, in my view, be respected by the Court.
[45]
Mr. Dokaj claims that there exists a major distinction between the
Act
and the
Customs Act
that justifies deviation from the jurisprudence relating to the
Customs Act
. That distinction is with respect to what he describes as "automatic forfeiture" under the
Customs Act
versus "no automatic forfeiture under the
Act
". He contends that the
Act
creates a presumption for return of the money and the provision is mandatory.
[46]
The short answer to this submission is s. 23 of the
Act
which, like s. 122 of the
Customs Act
, does provide for automatic forfeiture. It is correct that s. 18(2) specifies that unless the customs official has reasonable grounds to suspect that the currency or monetary instruments constitute proceeds of crime or terrorist financing, the seized currency or monetary instruments shall, on payment of a penalty in the prescribed amount, be returned to the individual or the lawful owner. This subsection is analogous to s. 117 of the
Customs Act
which allows for the return of seized goods if money is paid equal to a maximum of the value of the goods plus the duties owing. The only distinction between the provisions is that the
Customs Act
does not delineate a test to be applied by the customs official in deciding whether or not the goods should be returned. Rather, it permits the Minister to exercise discretion in this regard.
[47]
It is also true that s. 133 of the
Customs Act
uses the word "may" to describe the various options available to the Minister, when reviewing the sanction for non-compliance imposed by the customs official, while s. 29 of the
Act
uses the word "shall". In my view, that is a difference without a distinction. It is unreasonable to suggest that the Minister could choose not to render any decision under s. 133 of the
Customs Act
after finding that a contravention had occurred. The word "may", in that context, must be interpreted as mandatory rather than permissive (see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)).
[48]
Finally, the fact that the privative clause at s. 123 of the
Customs Act
refers to precluding review other than in the manner provided by s. 129, while the privative clause at s. 24 of the
Act
refers to precluding review other than in the manner provided by ss. 25 to 30, in no way detracts from the clear and unambiguous language employed within those provisions. The similarities between the
Act
and the
Customs Act
far outweigh the minor distinctions. The overall scheme of both is the same and Parliament intended that they operate harmoniously.
[49]
To conclude, in my view, to interpret s. 30(1) of the
Act
in the manner proposed by the plaintiff would require the insertion of words not included in the provision. Specifically, an amendment such as that set out below would be necessary.
“30(1) A person who requests a decision of the Minister under section 25 may, within 90 days after being notified of the decision, appeal the decision [
and any subsequent decision under section 29
] by way of an action in the Federal Court in which the person is the plaintiff and the Minister is the defendant”
[50]
Parliament chose not to insert such language and it is not for the Court to override Parliament's intent.
[51]
In the result, for the foregoing reasons, the answer to the question - does the Federal Court have jurisdiction pursuant to s. 30 of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17, to review a ministerial decision issued pursuant to s. 29 of that
Act
- is no. In the exercise of my discretion, I decline to award costs.
ORDER
[52]
THIS COURT ORDERS THAT the answer to the question set out below is "no".
“Does the Federal Court have jurisdiction pursuant to s. 30 of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17, to review a ministerial decision issued pursuant to s. 29 of that

1. The Plaintiff is a Canadian citizen, originally from Albania, who resides in Toronto, Ontario.
2. The Defendant is the Solicitor General of Canada. Effective December 12, 2003, responsibility for the administration of those provisions of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17 (hereinafter "
PCMLTFA
”) originally assigned to the Minister of National Revenue was transferred to the Solicitor General of Canada, styled as the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, pursuant to Order in Council P.C. 2003-2064 and ss. 2(a) and 3 of the
Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-34.
3. On October 16, 2003, the Plaintiff was travelling to Tirana, Albania via Athens, Greece. His flight to Greece was to depart from the Montreal International Airport (Dorval).
4. The Plaintiff was carrying $US 25,950.00 in currency of the United States of America and $400.00 in Canadian currency.
5. On October 16, 2003, customs officials at the Montreal International Airport (Dorval) asked the Plaintiff if he was in possession of any currency or monetary instruments of a value equal to or greater than $10,000.00 Canadian Dollars. The Plaintiff answered the question in the negative.
6. Customs officials then proceeded to search the Plaintiff. The search revealed $US 25,950.00 in American currency and $400.00 in Canadian currency in his coat pocket, luggage and wallet. The total value of this currency on October 16, 2003 was approximately $34,654.00.
7. As none of the currency found in the possession of the Plaintiff had been reported to Customs officials, contrary to s. 12(1) of the
PCMLTFA
, the currency was seized as forfeit and was not returned to the Plaintiff pursuant to s. 18 of the
PCMLTFA
. A "Customs Seizure Receipt" was provided to the Plaintiff, a copy of which is attached as. Exhibit "A" to this agreed statement of facts.
8. On or around October 29, 2003, the Plaintiff requested a decision of the Minister of National Revenue as to whether s. 12(1) of the
PCMLTFA
was contravened pursuant to s. 25 of the
PCMLTFA
.
9. On or around November 20, 2003, officials of the Minister of National Revenue advised the Plaintiff that his October 29, 2003 request had been accepted as a request for a review of the October 16, 2003 enforcement action pursuant to s. 25 of the
PCMLTFA
. At the same time, the Plaintiff was provided with a notice of the circumstances of the seizure pursuant to s. 26(1) of the
PCMLTFA
and invited to furnish any evidence in the matter that he may desire to furnish pursuant to s. 26(2) of the
PCMLTFA
.
10. On or around December 17, 2003, the Plaintiff provided additional evidence to be considered pursuant to s. 26(2) of the
PCMLTFA
.
11. On March 16, 2004, the Defendant issued a decision pursuant to s. 27 of the
PCMLTFA
that there was a contravention of s. 12(1) of the
PCMLTFA
in respect of the currency in question that had been seized from the Plaintiff. Also on March 16, 2004, the Defendant issued a decision pursuant to s. 29 of the
PCMLTFA
confirming that the seized currency is forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
12. By Statement of Claim dated June 9, 2004, the Plaintiff has instituted a statutory appeal pursuant to s. 30 of the
PCMLTFA
.
13. By order dated October 26, 2004, the Federal Court (Tabib P.) dismissed the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's claim but granted an extension of time for the filing of a defence.
14. The Defendant filed a statement of defence on November 24, 2004.
15. The Plaintiff filed a reply on December 6, 2004.
