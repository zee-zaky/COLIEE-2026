1. The Nature Of The Proceeding
[1]
Gibson, J.
: The applicant, Unitel Communications Inc., by originating notice of motion filed March 25, 1991, seeks an order pursuant to s. 57(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13 (the "
Act
") to strike out eight trademarks owned by the respondent, Bell Canada (The original application included an additional trademark No. 283,025 for "CALLING CARD" the registration of which was voluntarily abandoned by the respondent pursuant to s. 41(b) of the
Act
prior to the commencement of the hearing of this application.). The trademarks at issue all relate to telecommunication services and are entered in the registry of trademarks as follows: no. 311,052 for WATS, no. 310,547 for INWATS, no. 311,051 for OUTWATS, no. 372,519 for 900 SERVICE, no. 372,518 for LE SERVICE 900, no. 285,112 for CALLING CARD, no. 285,658 for CARTE D'APPEL and no. 377,785 for 800 PLUS. The applicant submits that, at the date of this application, the marks did not accurately express or define the existing rights of the respondent. More particularly, the applicant submits that none of the marks was registrable at the date of registration when considered against the terms of s. 18(1)(a) and s. 12(1) of the
Act
and, or in the alternative, none of the marks was distinctive at the date of this application within the terms of s. 18(1)(b) of the
Act
. In addition, the applicant submits the marks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL were improperly registered on the basis of false declarations of use by the original registrant, Transcanada Telephone System, and therefor should be struck from the register.
[2]
By reason of the number of trademarks at issue in this proceeding and the number of issues raised, these reasons are rather long and complex. As an aid to their review, I have therefor annexed to the end of the reasons an index to the headings and subheadings I have used and to the page numbers [now paragraph numbers] where they appear.
2. The Trademarks At Issue
[3]
Each entry on the register sets forth a registration date, the date the owner commenced use of the trademark and, in four cases, records registered users.
[4]
The marks WATS and OUTWATS were registered January 31, 1986 for use in association with long distance telephone services with the date of use of each shown as "at least as early as 1962". The two marks have the following recorded as registered users: Alberta Government Telephones (AGT), British Columbia Telephone Company (BCTel), Saskatchewan Telecommunications (SaskTel), The Island Telephone Company (Island Tel), Maritime Telegraph and Telephone Company Ltd. (MT&T), Newfoundland Telephone Company Ltd. (Nfld Tel), The New Brunswick Telephone Company Ltd. (NB Tel) and the Manitoba Telephone System (MTS). (Certified Record, v. 1, T.2)
[5]
The mark INWATS was registered January 17, 1986 for use in association with long distance telephone services with the date of use shown as "since at least as early as 1969". There are no registered users of this mark.
[6]
The marks 900 SERVICE and LE SERVICE 900 were registered August 24, 1990 for use in association with telecommunication services which allow telephone users to access prerecorded information or to register a positive or negative opinion, with the date of use shown as "since JUL/JUIL 1984". There are no registered users for these marks.
[7]
The mark 800 PLUS was registered December 28, 1990 for use in association with "Toll free telecommunication services" with a declaration of use filed October 25, 1990. There are no registered users for this mark.
[8]
Subsequent to the filing of this application, the respondent applied to have those users registered for WATS and OUTWATS recorded as registered users for the marks INWATS, 900 SERVICE, LE SERVICE 900 and 800 PLUS. (Certified Record, v. 20, T. 23 - Affidavit of Marc Bédard)
[9]
The entries for CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL are somewhat more complicated. The mark CALLING CARD was registered on November 18, 1983 with a declaration of use filed August 16, 1983. The mark CARTE D'APPEL was registered on December 9, 1983 with a declaration of use filed September 13, 1983. Both marks were registered for "Telecommunication services namely, providing general telephone services to customers who charge the cost of such services to authorized account numbers." Both marks were registered by Transcanada Telephone System ("TCTS"), which also declared it had commenced use in Canada. Subsequently, TCTS filed a change in title on both marks to Telecom Canada dated March 11, 1988. On August 26, 1988 both marks were transferred from Telecom Canada to Bell Canada, the respondent herein. Between November 10, 1989 and July 6, 1990, the same fifty-one (51) registered users were recorded with respect to each mark. An additional registered user was recorded in respect of CALLING CARD on February 8, 1991. While I do not find it necessary to list every registered user, it is significant that BCTel, SaskTel and Nfld Tel, registered users recorded for the marks WATS and OUTWATS, were never recorded as registered users of either CALLING CARD or CARTE D'APPEL. The respondent filed applications to record these parties as registered users in June of 1991 (Certified Record, v. 20, T. 23 - Bédard affidavit), subsequent to filing of the originating notice of motion herein. According to the respondent, missing registrations were originally by oversight. Counsel before me indicated that the belated applications were not pursued as the
Act
was to be amended to eliminate the requirement for registration of authorized users. (Certified Record, v. 19, T. 15 para. 14 - Affidavit of Richard D. French)
3. The Parties
[10]
The applicant Unitel Communications Inc. ("Unitel") is the 1990 successor to CNCP Telecommunications, a 1980 amalgamation of the telecommunications divisions of Canadian National Railways and Canadian Pacific Railways. Unitel and its predecessors provided, over many years, telegraph services and, more recently, other telecommunication services such as voice mail, TELEX and facsimile transmission. In a limited capacity, Unitel and its predecessors also provided telephone service, in co-operation with certain telephone companies. Such services commenced between Fort William and Winnipeg in 1926 and between Kamloops and Calgary in 1928. Until 1992, pursuant to rulings of the Canadian Radio-Television & Telecommunications Commission (the "CRTC"), Unitel had restricted rights to offer telephone service between points within Canada on private lines not connected to the public telephone system. These lines were purchased by private entities. For example, a company might have had Unitel service between its branches but could not use this service to call outside parties. Unitel did offer unrestricted telephone service from points within Canada to the United States by way of interconnection agreements with U.S. telephone companies. (Certified Record, v. 16, T. 32 - Affidavit of William Edmund Beatty)
[11]
On June 12, 1992 the CRTC granted Unitel's application to interconnect with the public telephone network [see footnote 1], essentially putting Unitel on the same footing as the respondent, Bell Canada, and other public telephone companies in respect of long-distance service. This decision will be referred to in these reasons as the "CRTC decision". The CRTC decision was subsequent to the applicant filing its Originating Notice of Motion but prior to the commencement of the hearing of this matter.
[12]
The respondent, Bell Canada, is the self-described "largest supplier of telecommunications services" in Canada, with approximately seven million subscribers and eight million, eight hundred thousand (8.8 million) network access lines in Ontario, Quebec and the eastern part of the Arctic. Bell Canada offers a variety of telecommunication services, including message-toll service (MTS), the technical name for long-distance calling. (Certified Record, v. 19, T. 15 - Affidavit of Richard D. French)
4. Stentor And The Industry
[13]
Bell Canada is a member of Stentor, an unincorporated association not regulated by the CRTC, which is the successor to Telecom Canada, which in turn was the successor to TCTS. The role of Stentor in the telecommunication industry is best understood with some rudimentary background on the Canadian telecommunication industry as a whole.
[14]
The provision of telecommunication services in Canada was regulated first under s. 336 of the
Railway Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-3, and subsequently under the
National Telecommunications Powers and Procedures Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-20, under the auspices of the CRTC. At no time did a legal or de jure monopoly on the provision of telecommunication services in Canada exist. There are nine major telecommunication service companies which belong to what is now Stentor: Bell, AGT, BCTel, SaskTel, Island Tel, MT&T, Nfld Tel., NBTel and MTS. Telesat Canada is also a member. Stentor is, in the words of counsel for the respondent, a "cooperative organization" which never directly provided telecommunication services. (For a more elaborate description of the nature of TCTS as it then was, see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at 237-238 and 253.) The nature of Stentor and the relationship among its members will be discussed in greater detail with respect to the TCTS declaration of use of the marks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL.
[15]
In addition to the major service providers belonging to Stentor, there are more than forty independent telephone companies located in Ontario, Québec, Alberta, British Columbia and the pacific north-west. Each of these independent telephone companies provides its subscribers with local telecommunication services and, at least in the vast majority of cases, access to the long distance telecommunication network by way of a traffic agreement with one of the members of the Stentor group. The majority of independent telephone companies, located in Ontario and Québec, have traditionally been regulated by the Ontario Telephone Service Commission and the Régie de Télécommunications du Québec [see footnote 2]. The respondent's evidence is to the effect that the independent companies, although numerous, account for only approximately 7% of the network access lines in Canada while collectively the members of Stentor provide approximately 93% or 14 million of the network access lines in Canada. As indicated earlier, the respondent provides approximately 8.8 million or 60% of the total number of network access lines in Canada. (Certified Record, v. 19, T. 15 - Affidavit of Richard D. French: The applicant did not take issue with these statistics.)
5. The Issues
[16]
Having briefly described the marks at issue, the parties and the industry of which the respondent is a major component and the applicant a recent competitor of the respondent and other members of Stentor in the provision of long-distance telecommunication services in Canada by virtue of the CRTC decision, I will turn to the preliminary issues of: first, whether the applicant meets the statutory threshold to file this application; and second, the admissibility of certain of the evidence.
I will then comment briefly on the issue of the relevant public or universe for the purpose of my analysis and conclusions and on the issue of whether or not the registrations of the marks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL are invalid by reason of alleged false declarations. I will conclude this portion of my reasons with a brief description of the main issues relating to the validity of each of the trademarks.
(1) Unitel As A "Person Interested"
[17]
In order to be entitled to file an application under s. 57(1) of the
Act
such as that before me, an applicant other than the Registrar of Trademarks must be a "person interested". Sections 57(1) and 58 of the
Act
provide:
"57(1) The Federal Court has exclusive original jurisdiction, on the application of the Registrar or
of any person interested
, to order that any entry in the register be struck out or amended on the ground that at the date of the application the entry as it appears on the register does not accurately express or define the existing rights of the person appearing to be the registered owner of the mark.
. . . . .
"58. An application under section 57 shall be made either by the filing of an originating notice of motion, by counterclaim in an action for the infringement of the trademark, or by statement of claim in an action claiming additional relief under this Act." (underlining added by me for emphasis).
Section 2 of the
Act
defines "person interested" as follows:
"'person interested' includes any person who is affected or reasonably apprehends that he may be affected by any entry in the register, or by any act or omission or contemplated act or omission under or contrary to the Act, and includes the Attorney General of Canada;"
[18]
The applicant claims it is affected or reasonably apprehends it may be affected as it and its predecessors offered telecommunication services prior to and at the time this application was filed and any restrictions on their capacity to do so were regulatory not statutory.
[19]
The applicant referred me to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), where, at page 23, Cattanach, J., concluded that there is no material difference between the English jurisprudence requiring an applicant to be a "person aggrieved" and the Canadian statutory requirement that an applicant must be a "person interested".
[20]
The applicant argued that the respondent's "cease and desist" letter (Certified Record, v. 16, T. 32 - Affidavit of William Edmund Beatty, Ex. B) regarding the applicant's use of the trademarks in correspondence with the CRTC amounts to an admission by the respondent that the applicant is prima facie a person interested. In the alternative, the applicant submits that the CRTC decision cured any defect in the status of the applicant and that it would therefor not be in the interest of justice to dismiss its application on the technical ground that the applicant was not a person interested at the date this application was brought when it became such a person before this matter came on for hearing. In support of this argument the applicant referred to the comments of Kerr, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 236 (Exch. Ct.), in addressing the argument of the respondent therein that the original applicant, having transferred all of its assets to its U.S. parent company, could not be a "person interested" and the U.S. parent could not be a person interested as it had failed to amend the originating notice therein to state it was an interested party:
"I feel that the other more important issues should be determined in these proceedings, in the interest of justice and to avert the institution of fresh proceedings raising essentially the same principal issues, and that the application should not be dismissed on the narrow ground on the objection set forth ..."
[21]
The applicant argued that it or its predecessors always had the right to offer telecommunication services and the nature of the services it and they could offer were merely subject to regulation. Thus the CRTC decision did not purport to grant a licence, as the respondent argued, or bestow rights on the applicant, but merely amounted to an order allowing the applicant to interconnect and consequently the applicant was de facto able to offer to the public what it at law always could have - long distance telecommunication services between points within Canada.
[22]
The applicant further relied on the affidavit evidence of two affiants put forward as experts in the telecommunication industry, Mr. Ian Angus (Certified Record v. 16, T. 30 - Affidavit of Ian Angus) and Ms. Judith Cole (Certified Record v. 17, T. 37 - Affidavit of Judith Cole), who opine that it could be difficult to operate a telecommunication business in Canada without using the marks at issue to describe services being offered. Finally, the applicant offered the testimony of a marketing employee, Ms. Filomena Giulione, as to the difficulty she had in preparing a marketing campaign for a Unitel telephone charge-card without using the phrase "calling card" to describe the product. (Certified Record, v. 29, T. 2 - Affidavit of Filomena Giulione)
[23]
The respondent argued that at the date of filing the originating notice of motion, the applicant's request for interconnection with the public telephone network had not yet been granted by the CRTC and consequently the applicant was not a "person interested" in any of the marks at issue as it was unable to offer any of the services in association with which the marks are registered. In addition, the respondent submits the burden is on the applicant to establish it is a "person interested" for each of the marks at issue ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  authorities in support of the proposition that an applicant must show how it is liable to suffer, must demonstrate the harm, and cannot meet the threshold where it has no right in the absence of the registration to use the mark. Only one of these cases was an expungement application, that being
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). Unlike the application before me, the issue in that case was whether the trademark was confusing.
[24]
The respondent relied on several affidavits of an affiant who suggested other terms which are available to the applicant to use in connection with the services covered by the marks at issue. (Certified Record, v. 19, T. 8-11 - Affidavits of Timothy Edge)
[25]
I am not satisfied that the respondent's "cease and desist" letter is in any sense determinative of this issue. Nor am I convinced by the applicant's argument that the respondent's position on this issue is a mere technical ground which should be ignored in the interest of justice. On the other hand, it is worth referring to comments earlier in the same paragraph as the comments of Kerr, J., in
Aladdin
relied on by the applicant and cited above:
"The proceedings, as I have said, have involved a great deal of preparation; and practically all of the preparation was in respect of those other issues. (here, the issue of the validity of the trademarks.) I have no reason to think that the factual situation in respect of those issues was not the same ... when the present applicant was granted leave to continue the proceedings in lieu of
Aladdin (Canada)
, as the factual situation was on August 17, 1964, when the proceedings were commenced."
[26]
Unlike the matter before Kerr, J., the factual situation with respect to the issues before me is not identical. Significantly, the registered user regime of the
Act
as it read at the time this application was filed is no longer in existence. Instead, there is a licensing regime with significant differences as to what constitutes authorized or permitted use of a trademark. If the
Act
in its current form were to apply, much of the evidence of use presented by the applicant as violating the trademarks at issue might not be relevant. Thus, if the applicant were required to file a new originating notice, the result might possibly be different.
[27]
The English case law essentially establishes a "de minimis" threshold which the applicant bears the burden of meeting. As indicated earlier, this case law has been followed and relied on in jurisprudence of this court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stated "The definition is very broad in its implications". The threshold exists to defeat nuisance applications and an applicant need neither show "great and serious damage" [see footnote 3] nor be engaged in competition with the owner of the mark but does need to be in the same trade. The evidence filed on behalf of the applicant meets the threshold established by the jurisprudence. The applicant presented enough evidence to establish that although not able to directly compete or offer the services to which the trademarks at issue apply, the applicant and its predecessors in title were in the telecommunication trade and met the test as formulated by the English Court of Appeal at page 202 in
In the Matter of Powell's Trade Mark
:
"The true view, to my mind is, that we must look to see not merely as in the
Appolinaris
case, whether people are in the same trade and actually intending to carry on the business; but whether in the reasonable scope of the conduct of their affairs it is reasonably possible that they may want to carry it on, excluding remote possibilities and attaching oneself to real and substantial business chances." (In
Powell's Trade Mark
(1893), 10 R.P.C. 195 (C.A.); (1894), 11 R.P.C. 4 (H.L.))
[28]
I conclude that the applicant has established that it was, at the time this proceeding was commenced, a person interested in respect of each of the marks at issue.
(2) Admissibility of Certain Evidence
[29]
The respondent objected to the admission of a number of affidavits filed on behalf of the applicant on the basis that they were opinion evidence on the ultimate issue. The parties came to an agreement on certain deletions from the affidavits in question, sworn by persons dealing with the telecommunication aspects of medium-sized and large businesses on a full-time basis and referred to by counsel as telecommunication managers. I will use the same term. All of these affiants proffered their opinions that the trademarks at issue were descriptive and that both they and those that they dealt with in the telecommunication industry did not use the marks in a trademark sense but rather as generic terms. I allowed the affidavits, as modified by agreement of counsel, to remain as part of the record and indicated that the weight that I would attach to each would remain an issue.
[30]
The respondent further objected to the applicant's evidence of the state of the United States Register of Trademarks with respect to the marks at issue and any evidence of the use of the marks in the U.S. or in U.S. publications circulated in Canada. The respondent cited
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), in which Jerome, A.C.J., found both registration in a foreign jurisdiction and evidence of use in other jurisdictions irrelevant to distinctiveness in Canada. The respondent further directed me to the Federal Court of Appeal decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 289 (F.C.A.), relied on in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 221 (F.C.T.D.) (under appeal), where evidence of use of marks in the U.S. was found irrelevant with respect to distinctiveness in Canada. Finally, the respondent presented several authorities for the proposition that advertising in U.S. newspapers is not useful evidence for purpose of assessing public perception in Canada. (See Gilson,
Trade-Mark Protection and Practice
, Jerome Gilson, Vol. 1a (Matthew Bender, 1994) at 2-36; and
Aladdin Industries
, supra, para. [20], at 259)
[31]
In response, the applicant cited
Motel 6  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), where Addy, J., wrote at page 58:
"A trademark can neither distinguish nor be adapted to distinguish the services of a person if another person has used the mark in a foreign country and it has become known in Canada as the latter's mark in respect of similar services."
[32]
For the proposition that constant exposure to the use of a mark in use in the United States can affect public perception in Canada and that it can be sufficient, for example, to establish a reputation of a trade name in Canada, the applicant referred to
Institut National des Appellations d'Origine des Vins et  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.R.(2d) 726 (C.A.). Finally, the applicant argued that the
Philip Morris
decision relied on by the respondent does not stand for the proposition cited by the respondent. Counsel referred me to the following extract from that decision at page 297:
"In other words, although the spillover effect in Canada of advertising in American periodicals may be of relevance with respect to initial registration of a mark in Canada or where there is no legal assignment, it cannot be deemed to create a user in Canada which can subsequently invalidate a legitimate registration based on a valid transfer of title to the Canadian registrant. To hold otherwise would be to subject Canadian registrants to a force majeure over which they had no effective control."
[33]
On the facts before me, I favour the position of the respondent in this connection. At all times relevant to this matter, the major providers of long-distance telecommunication services in Canada were well known and clearly distinguishable from the providers of equivalent services in the United States. This reality stands in stark contrast with the provision of motel services which was the subject of the
Motel 6
decision. In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case referred to above, Mr. Justice Cullen stated at page 231 C.P.R.:
"The Federal Court of Appeal, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ... held that the distinctiveness in question must be in relation to other wares that are offered on the Canadian market. MacGuigan, J., quoted with approval the words of Tomlin, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 410 ...
'For the purpose of seeing whether the mark is distinctive, it is to the market of this country alone that one has to have regard. For that purpose foreign markets are wholly irrelevant, unless it is shown by evidence that in fact goods have been sold in this country with a foreign mark on them, and that the mark so used has thereby become identified with the manufacturer of the goods.'
"Therefore, even if 'Fibregrate' is distinctive of the products of Fibregrate Corp. in the United States, this would be irrelevant for the purposes of distinctiveness in Canada. As Thurlow, C.J., stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 74, ...:
'With respect to distinctiveness at the time of the bringing of the counter- claim, there is in my view no reason to conclude that these marks did not actually distinguish the services or wares of the respondent from those of others. The use of the marks in the United States by the United States company, in my opinion, has no bearing on the capacity of the marks to distinguish the services and wares provided by the respondent in Canada from those of others. No such services or wares were being offered or had been offered in Canada by the United States company.'"
[34]
I adopt the position set forth in the foregoing quotation for the purposes of this matter. While some or all of the marks here at issue may have been in use in the United States in relation to long-distance telecommunication services at times relevant to this matter and advertising of those services in the United States may well have taken place in Canada, under the regulatory scheme in place in Canada, in the terms of Thurlow, C.J., "
no such services or wares were being offered or had been offered in Canada by the United States company
." I therefore conclude that evidence as to the state of the Trademark register in the United States and as to use of terms in the United States identical or similar to the marks here at issue is irrelevant for the purposes of this matter.
(3) Alleged False Declarations
[35]
As indicated earlier, applications for registration of the trademarks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL were filed by Transcanada Telephone System, a predecessor of Stentor. In the applications, TCTS declared its intention to use the trademarks. On the basis of declarations of use filed by TCTS on June 23, 1983 and September 13, 1983 respectively, the trademarks were registered in its name.
[36]
Until June 9, 1993, s. 40(2) of the
Act
read as follows:
"(2)	When an application for registration of a proposed trademark is allowed, the Registrar shall give notice to the applicant accordingly and shall register the trademark and issue a certificate of its registration on receipt of a declaration that the applicant, his successor in title or a person approved as a registered user under subsection 50(7) has commenced the use of the trademark in Canada in association with the wares or services specified in the application." (Effective June 9, 1993, s. 40(2) was amended in consequence of the change from a registered user regime to a licensing regime that became effective that day and that is discussed later in these reasons.)
[37]
Although the applicant filed the required declarations that it had commenced use of the trademarks in Canada in association with the services specified in the applications, counsel for the respondent acknowledged before me that Stentor and its predecessors never directly provided telecommunication services, but rather acted as cooperative organizations for their members, most of which were registered as registered users of the marks, but only some years after the registration of the marks. In any event, none of the TCTS members filed declarations of use. On the basis of these facts alone, the applicant argued that the registrations of CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL are invalid and should be expunged.
(4) The Relevant Public or Universe
[38]
As will be seen later, the analysis of whether or not a trademark is descriptive derives from the first impression of the relevant "purchasers", "consuming public" or "universe". With respect to distinctiveness, a similar universe operates as the "measuring stick" against which evidence of use is analyzed. The applicant and respondent presented dramatically different views of the relevant "purchasers", "consuming public" or "universe" in relation to the trademarks at issue.
(5) The Validity of the Trademarks
[39]
The Federal Court of Canada has jurisdiction under s. 57(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
, quoted earlier in these reasons, to expunge trademarks from the register.
[40]
Generally speaking, the
Act
provides that registrations are presumed valid. At all times relevant to this matter, s. 19 provided:
"19.	Subject to sections 21 and 32, the registration of a trademark in respect of any wares or services, unless shown to be invalid, gives to the owner of the trademark the exclusive right to the use throughout Canada of the trademark in respect of those wares or services." (Section 19 was amended effective June 9, 1993 so that the opening words now read "19. Subject to sections 21, 32 and 67, ...". Section 67 relates to trademarks under the laws of Newfoundland before April 1, 1949.)
[41]
Section 21 deals with concurrent use in Canada, before filing, of a confusing trademark or tradename and s. 32 with restriction of a registration as to wares or services and a defined territorial area in Canada.
[42]
The role of the court in proceedings such as this is to consider the public interest at stake and to balance the conflicting interests of the parties to the litigation. As to the public interest aspect, Kerr, J., stated at pages 273 and 274 of
Aladdin
, "Legislation concerning trademarks exists primarily in the interest of and for the protection of the public (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 196) ...". As to the balancing of conflicting interests, see:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. 101, at 113.
[43]
The applicant seeks to expunge the marks at issue. This court may order that a trademark be expunged from the registry if, in the terms of s. 57(1) of the
Act
"... at the date of the application the entry as it appears on the registry does not accurately express or define the existing rights of the person appearing to be the registered owner of the mark. Clearly then, a trademark should be expunged if it is invalid. Section 18 of the
Act
provides as follows:
"18(1) The registration of a trademark is invalid if
(a) the trademark was not registrable at the date of registration,
(b) the trademark is not distinctive at the time proceedings bringing the validity of the registration into question are commenced, or
(c) the trademark has been abandoned,
and subject to section 17, it is invalid if the applicant for registration was not the person entitled to secure the registration.
"18(2) No registration of a trademark that had been so used in Canada by the registrant or his predecessor in title as to have become distinctive at the date of registration shall be held invalid merely on the ground that evidence of the distinctiveness was not submitted to the competent authority or tribunal before the grant of the registration."
[44]
The applicant claims that none of the marks at issue was registrable as each was, at the date of its registration, clearly descriptive of the character or quality of the telecommunication services in association with which it was used or proposed to be used, the name in English or French of the telecommunication services with which it was used or proposed to be used, or had, by ordinary and bona fide commercial usage, come to be recognized in Canada as designating the kind of services in association with which it was used and was therefor a mark the adoption of which was prohibited. The applicant further claims that none of the marks was distinctive at the time this proceeding was commenced, March 25, 1991, in that none was capable of distinguishing the services of the respondent from those offered by others.
[45]
The respondent denies each of the applicant's claims and submits that, pursuant to s. 19 quoted above, the applicant bears the burden of proving each mark was invalid at the material time.
[46]
The applicant's claim as to the non-registrability of each of the trademarks at its date of registration reflects the following provisions of the
Act
:
"12(1) Subject to s. 13, a trademark is registrable if it is not
. . . . .
(b) whether depicted, written or sounded, either clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive in the English or French language of the character or quality of the wares or services in association with which it is used or proposed to be used or of the conditions of or the persons employed in their production or of their place of origin;
(c) the name in any language of any of the wares or services in connection with which it is used or proposed to be used;
. . . . .
(e) a mark of which the adoption is prohibited by section 9 or 10.
. . . . .
"10.	Where any mark has by ordinary and bona fide commercial usage become recognized in Canada as designating the kind, quality, quantity, destination, value, place of origin or date of production of any wares or services, no person shall adopt it as a trademark in association with such wares or services or others of the same general class or use it in a way likely to mislead, nor shall any person so adopt or so use any mark so nearly resembling that mark as to be likely to be mistaken therefor."
[47]
"Distinctive" is defined in s. 2 of the
Act
in the following terms:
"'distinctive', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted to so distinguish them;"
6. The Evidence Other Than
Survey Evidence
[48]
I will group the evidence on behalf of the applicant, other than survey evidence, into the following categories: regulatory body materials and correspondence; annual reports of the respondent and other telephone companies; dictionaries and specialized lexicons; newspaper and periodical articles; telephone directories; the U.S. Register and U.S. advertising circulating in Canada; and evidence of telecommunication managers and consultants. In many of these categories there is evidence of use both by the respondent and registered users and by third party /unauthorized users. The applicant's evidence also lends itself to grouping in relation to four groups of marks as follows: WATS, INWATS and OUTWATS; CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL; 900 SERVICE and LE SERVICE 900; and 800 PLUS.
(1) Evidence on Behalf of the Applicant
(a) Regulatory Body Materials
& Correspondence
(i) WATS; INWATS; OUTWATS
[49]
The evidence filed on behalf of the applicant illustrates use of all of the marks without a trademark notation by the respondent, other telecommunication companies and the regulatory bodies. The respondent filed tariffs with the CRTC in which it used the marks to refer to its services. For example, under the heading "Wide-Area Telephone Service" the respondent referred to "WATS/800 zones" in a 1986 tariff submission and "WATS zones" in a 1969 document. The respondent's tariffs use the marks to describe the relevant service. The following example from a 1969 document, again under the heading "Wide-Area Telephone Service" is typical: "The following rates and charges provide for service to WATS zones as shown ... . For each home area, each WATS zone bears a number from 1 - 7 ...". Another 1969 document contains similar usage of the marks: "The rates and charges stated below apply for each INWATS and each OUTWATS and for each such service include one access line ... They provide for service to and from wats zones as shown." Identical usage occurs in subsequent tariff documents from 1970 until 1986, the year of registration of WATS, INWATS and OUTWATS. I note that the lower case use of "wats" occurred only in the document cited above. The respondent consistently used WATS in parenthesis following "Wide Area Telephone Service" as in "Introduction of new services and improvements such as: - Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS). In its own marketing materials, such as a 1975 Business Services Manual, the respondent discusses "Outwats and Voicecom printouts" and "Inwats usage" and in an earlier 1969 marketing document (apparently distributed by the respondent in a class taught by a Mr. Kuehn, an affiant on behalf of the applicant), the respondent lists WATS in two glossaries of terms with an explanation of the service and again, following in parenthesis the phrase "Wide Area Telephone Service". Documents filed on behalf of the respondent include the following explanation of OUTWATS:
"OUTWATS is an outgoing long-distance service to any dialable telephone anywhere in the provinces of Canada, available at economical bulk rates. (
OUT
going +
W
ide
A
rea
T
elephone
S
ervice = OUTWATS)"
[50]
Use by other telecommunication companies in their tariffs was similar to that of the respondent - the companies list WATS under the heading "Wide-Area Telephone Service" and proceed to discuss the provision of the service. For example, a 1990 Island Tel tariff states:
"Wide-Area Telephone Service (WATS) is provided in the form of two service categories, OUTWATS and Island Tel 800 Service ... OUTWATS provides for customer dialled calling from a specific telephone number within the Province of Prince Edward Island ... OUTWATS Service zones are designated by Numbering Plan Area (NPA) codes, commonly known as Area Codes, used in Message Toll calling."
[51]
One company, MT&T, listed both "Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) and MT&T WATS. Submissions to the CRTC by BCTel regarding TCTS rates include this variation of use:
"The Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) rate changes involve both Out-WATS and In-WATS ... WATS is basically discounted message toll within a specific area or zone. The proposed rate revisions to WATS service will maintain the rate relationships with the proposed changes in customer-dialled MTS rates. An important element of the WATS restructuring was to make the rates more reflective of customer usage and, of course, value."
[52]
Third parties, that is, those not authorized as registered users of the marks, used the trademarks in the same manner. Telecommunication companies not recorded as registered users, Nfld Tel for example in relation to INWATS, had a tariff with similar usage. I note this evidence dates subsequent to the date the marks were registered. Traffic agreements and related documents in 1976 and 1977 filed with the CRTC between the respondent and Thunder Bay Telephone Company, an independent telephone company, refer to "Wide-Area Telephone Service" as "OUTWATS" or "Inwats or Outwats", the provision of "Outwats, Inwats and the switching of TWX services" and use OUTWATS and INWATS as "service categories to be known as ...".
[53]
The regulatory bodies themselves used the marks, again in a similar manner. Public notices, decisions and annual reports of the CRTC and its predecessor the Canadian Transport Commission ("CTC") use WATS in conjunction with "Wide-Area Telephone Service". In its 1979 refusal of an application for interconnection, the CRTC refers to WATS as a category of service: "Bell's public telephone service falls primarily into three categories: local, message toll service or long distance service (MTS) and Wide-Area Telephone Service (WATS). The CRTC, the Ontario Telephone Service Commission ("OTSC") and the Canadian Business Telecommunications Alliance ("CBTA") all use WATS as interchangeable with MTS service in the following manner: "MTS/WATS". While the CRTC documents date prior to the registration of the trademarks, the OTSC and CBTA references are subsequent to registration. Also subsequent to the registration dates, the respondent has also used WATS as interchangeable with MTS "(MTS/WATS)".
(ii) CALLING CARD;
CARTE D'APPEL
[54]
The body of evidence of use of these marks by the respondent is significantly smaller than with WATS and the related marks. Nonetheless, the respondent did use the phrase CALLING CARD without a trademark notation in its 1989 and 1990 tariffs, which included trademark notations for other services. In several other submissions to the CRTC, the respondent refers to "Automated Calling Card Services (ACCS)" in both upper and lower case, as well as "Calling Card calls" without any indication of the difference, if any, between the two. Registered users also used the expression in lower case letters and without a trademark notation in their tariffs.
[55]
In tariffs filed by BCTel, the expression "calling card" is consistently used without a trademark notation and paired with nouns such as "calls". BCTel was never a registered user of these trademarks. In tariffs filed between 1983 and 1990 by BCTel, "Long Distance Calling Card" and "station-to-station long distance calling card billing" appear consistently.
(iii) 900 SERVICE; LE SERVICE 900
[56]
Tariffs filed by users other than the respondent refer to "900 Service" in various word combinations, such as in the 1983 AGT tariff which refers to "Sponsors of 900 Service Information Arrangements". Several tariffs discuss 900 SERVICE and pre-date the registration of the trademark: a 1988 Northwest Tel tariff, a 1989 Nfld Tel tariff, a 1989 MT&T tariff and a cancelled 1986 BCTel tariff. In several of these tariffs there is a reference to Telecom Canada as the service provider - "Telecom Canada's 900 Service". The following in an MT&T tariff reflects the general nature of the use of the mark:
900 Service
"This service is a form of long-distance service provided on the public switched network that permits simultaneous calling by a large number of callers to certain 900-prefixed telephone numbers. 900 Service is available to Company subscribers ..."
[57]
Use by the regulatory bodies themselves repeats that which I have described regarding WATS - without a trademark notation and in phrasing in a 1990 CRTC Order such as "the introduction of 900 SERVICE" or "l'introduction du SERVICE 900". OTSC documents include discussion of "900 SERVICE messages to the Bell Canada system" as well as several references to 900 SERVICE, again without a trademark notation.
(iv) 800 PLUS
[58]
A 1989 tariff filed by the respondent describes 800 PLUS as "providing additional features for Canada 800 Service" and, again, does not provide a trademark notation. Tariffs filed by parties other than the respondent indicate that a number of nonregistered users provide this service. These include BCTel, Nfld Tel, AGT and a number of independent telephone companies in Quebec. The service is generally described as one which offers additional features to those of 800 Service.
(b) Annual Reports
(i) WATS; INWATS; OUTWATS
[59]
The annual reports of the respondent and other telecommunication companies, both registered and nonregistered users, reflect similar usage as in the regulatory body materials. For example, WATS appears consistently in parenthesis after "Wide Area Telephone Service" and in the same sentence as other non-trademarked services. The respondent makes use of WATS in conjunction with a description of the service, as illustrated in this paragraph from the 1964 Bell Canada Annual Report:
"The number of customers' lines serviced under the Wide Area Telephone plan increased from over 600 in 1963 to more than 1,400 at the end of 1964. WATS provides flat-rate long distance service within seven progressively wider zones, the largest of which included the whole of Canada."
[60]
Other telecommunication companies, both registered users and those not recorded as registered users, also used the marks in their annual reports. The 1984, 1985 and 1986 reports of BCTel (recorded as a registered user in November, 1987) discuss "WATS services". An undated Report of Quebec Telephone, which was never a registered user, also discusses "rate decreases in 800 and WATS services in Canada", while Sask Tel refers to "WATS ("Wide Area Telephone Service")."
(ii) CALLING CARD;
CARTE D'APPEL
[61]
A number of the reports of registered users refer to their own "Calling Cards", again without a trademark notation. Many of these reports also refer to "calling cards" in lower case as well as "calling card calls". These companies include Edmonton Telephones in 1985, Island Tel in 1986 and MT&T in 1989. NBTel and Quebec Telephone both use the expression "Automated Calling Card Service" in their 1989 reports, an expression which the respondent also used in its submissions to the CRTC. BCTel referred to the BCTel Calling Card in its 1984 report and, interestingly, the Telecom Canada calling card in its 1986 report.
(iii) 900 SERVICE; LE SERVICE 900
[62]
The applicant offered only three examples of annual reports which refer to the provision of 900 SERVICE without a trademark notation. A 1988 Sask Tel report refers specifically to "Sask Tel's 900 Service".
(c) Dictionaries and Specialized Lexicons
(i) WATS; INWATS; OUTWATS
[63]
The applicant filed extracts from a number of specialized technical dictionaries, all widely available and circulated in Canada and directed at the telecommunication industry. The dictionaries are, for the most part, published in the United States and some specifically address the U.S. industry. But all of the dictionaries, including those published with reference to the Canadian telecommunication industry, such as "Canadian Telecom Alert", list WATS, both in conjunction with INWATS and OUTWATS, and as an acronym for "Wide Area Telecommunications/Telephone Service". However, two dictionary listings are notable for their perspective on the status of WATS in the United States:
"'WATS' Wide Area Telecommunications Service: basically discounted toll service provided by all long distance and local phone companies. AT&T started WATS but forgot to trademark the name, so now every supplier uses it as a generic name. There are two types of WATS services - in and out WATS ... (
Newton's Telecom Dictionary
, Certified Record, v. 16, T. 30 - Affidavit of Ian Angus)
. . . . .
"When AT&T brought out WATS nearly three decades ago, it didn't bother to trademark or protect the name "WATS". There was no need to, it seemed. So the name became generic, now any long distance company can use it." (
Long Distance for Less, 3rd edition: The Official Guide to Long Distance Telephone Services in the United States
, Certified Record, v. 16, T-30 - Angus Affidavit)
[64]
A 1983 publication by Telecom Canada contains the following listing for WATS:
"Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS)
Outward WATS and inward WATS (800 Service) are telephone service offerings that are designed to meet the needs of customers who make or receive large volumes of long distance calls. Outward WATS customers can dial station-to-station calls direct ... Inward WATS is a service that allows a customer to receive calls originated within specified service areas without a charge to the originating customer." (Certified Record, v. 7, T. 7 - Affidavit of Jonathan Colombo)
(ii) CALLING CARD;
CARTE D'APPEL
[65]
The specialized publications discussed above contain references to calling card service but almost exclusively to the United States, describing it as a sort of credit card issued by various telephone companies to charge calls.
(d) Newspaper and Periodical Articles
[66]
This evidence relates to both commentaries on U.S. services and Canadian services, which the applicant argued are relevant given the consistent exposure of the Canadian public to the use of similar terms in the U.S.
(i) WATS; INWATS; OUTWATS
[67]
WATS appears following "Wide Area Telephone Service" and paired with nouns such as WATS service, WATS zones, WATS rates and WATS lines. Canadian newspapers refer to both U.S. services and Canadian services in the same manner, with the majority of the references to WATS and references to OUTWATS dating only from 1990. American newspapers, available and widely circulated in Canada, demonstrate similar usage of the same terms which are not trademarks in the United States.
[68]
Similar use of the marks occurs in periodical articles. WATS appears following "Wide Area Telephone Service", at times paired with MTS, "MTS/WATS", and paired with other nouns such as "WATS/service", "WATS/zones", "WATS/rates and "WATS/lines. Given that WATS is not a trademark in the United States, it is also paired consistently with the name of the service provider, as in "MCI WATS" or "AT&T WATS". The usage in Canadian periodical articles is similar - "Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS)", followed by WATS used simply as a noun or paired with a noun, for example "WATS blocks". The
Ontario Communications Handbook, 1988
, states under the heading "Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS)":
"The most familiar long distance service is message toll service (MTS) ... WATS takes a different approach to long distance rates by offering businesses a block of time for a monthly flat rate. In Ontario, the basic WATS blocks are five hours, 10 hours and 120 hours per month ... By using WATS, businesses with heavy long distance traffic can reduce their overall long distance expenditures. The rates for WATS are therefore less usage sensitive and distance sensitive than MTS." (Certified Record, Affidavit of Jonathan G. Colombo, V. 3, T. 3 - Ex. B-8)
(ii) CALLING CARD;
CARTE D'APPEL
[69]
Canadian and American newspapers use the expression "calling card" in articles filed that date from 1984 until 1990, generally in lower case letters combined with the word call or service. The usage also refers to specific Calling Cards including Bell, AGT, AT&T, or simply a telephone company card. A representative example is a 1989 article from the
Calgary Herald
discussing services offered by AGT:
"Visitors will be introduced to the coin 'n' card pay phone, where customers can choose how they wish to pay for a long-distance call - by coin, AGT calling card or credit card."
(iii) 900 SERVICE; LE SERVICE 900
[70]
While not as numerous as references to other marks, according to evidence filed, the use of these marks in newspapers begins as early as 1984 with a commentary on the availability of 900 SERVICE to Canadians through Telecom Canada. A 1986 article refers to the fact that Canada's major telephone companies began offering "900 service" in 1984. In 1990, the following illustration of descriptive use appears in
The Toronto Star
:
"The 900 service is not yet available in Canada, except for automated polling or call-count lines, which are actually routed into the U.S. over the AT&T network ... Bell plans to introduce the full 900 service in Ontario sometime in 1991 ... Gateway Communications ... is currently the largest provider of 900 services in the U.S." (Certified Record, v. 10, T. 11 - Affidavit of Carol Anne Matthews, Ex. E-6)
[71]
There are also references to the service in American newspapers and magazines beginning in 1983, in which the expression "900 Service" is often accompanied by a telephone company name such as MCI or AT&T or a discussion of "national 900 service".
(iv) 800 PLUS
[72]
The sole reference filed in evidence is a 1990 article discussing the CRTC's approval of changes in "800 service" to introduce "800 PLUS".
(e) Telephone Directories
[73]
The applicant filed white introductory pages from directories published by both the respondent and other telecommunication companies which are dated prior to and subsequent to the registration of the marks at issue. The following evidence is drawn from those pages.
(i) WATS; INWATS; OUTWATS
[74]
WATS appears following "Wide Area Telephone Service" and paired in expressions such as "WATS/service", "WATS/zones", "WATS/rates" and "WATS/lines". For example, a 1966 Metropolitan Winnipeg directory page asks: "What is WATS?", and answers "Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) is a long distance calling service" and further explains that both "Full Period WATS" and "Measured WATS" are available. Under the heading "Types of Calls", the 1978 and 1981 Regina Telephone Directories indicate "Inward Wide Area Telecommunications Service (WATS)" is "Inward WATS". None of the directory pages filed in evidence exhibit trademark designations for the marks WATS, INWATS and OUTWATS. The 1972 Quebec Tel directory, and Quebec Telephone is not a registered user of WATS, refers to "l'inwats" under "Types of Calls", a list which describes station-to-station, person-to-person and collect calls. The english language version uses the phrase "Inward Wide Area Telephone Service (INWATS)". A 1975 NBTel Directory and a 1974 Sask Tel Directory have equivalent references.
(ii) CALLING CARD;
CARTE D'APPEL
[75]
The applicant filed 19 excerpts from both independent and Stentor member directories which pre-dated the registration of the marks. These excerpts again use "Calling Card Call", "calling card number" and "calling card calls" in lists of services and explanations of long-distance calling, usually under the heading "Operator Assisted Calls". The 1983 Ontario Northland Directory refers to a "telephone company calling card number" and, interestingly, the 1983 Nfld Tel directory has a trademark notation in association with its use of "Calling Card".
[76]
The remaining evidence includes numerous examples (approximately 110) dating prior to the recording of any registered users of the marks and includes use by both companies subsequently registered as users and by three telecommunication companies never recorded as registered users: BCTel, Nfld Tel and Sask Tel. The use continues in the same manner as that evident prior to the registration, that is, without a trademark notation and often in lower case letters as in "calling card calls" and listed with descriptions of other services provided. A representative passage occurs in the Island Tel 1986 directory:
"Calling Card: Customers who have telephone company calling cards may place calls and charge them to their calling card number. Say 'Calling Card Call' and give your telephone company calling card number." (Certified Record, v. 11 and 12, T. 13 - Affidavit of Paul Sheehan)
(iii) 900 SERVICE; LE SERVICE 900
[77]
Evidence of the use of these marks is, again, indicative of use without trademark notations. References appear in directories under the heading "Directory Assistance" with the instruction to dial "1 + 900" or appear under a list of services and include the expression "900 service numbers" or "900 service calls".
[78]
The applicant also filed yellow pages from various telephone directories which evidence revealed the advertising of "resellers" who offered, for example, "National Wats - Inbound - Outbound - Local" or "National Inbound - Outbound Wats".
(f) The U.S. Register and U.S.
Advertising Circulating in Canada
[79]
I have earlier commented on certain of this evidence and found it to be irrelevant for the purposes of this matter. I will, nonetheless, summarize it briefly.
(i) WATS; INWATS; OUTWATS
[80]
As of February 22, 1991, none of the terms WATS, INWATS and OUTWATS was registered as a trademark in the United States and in fact any user of a mark with the term WATS was required to disclaim the right to the exclusive use of WATS. (Certified Record, v. 18, T. 38 - Affidavit of Naushina Panju)
[81]
The applicant presented rather ambiguous evidence of what it termed "reseller" advertising of long distance services in Canada. Resellers apparently rented lines from, among others, the respondent but maintained their own facilities. Thus, they provided their own service, or resold service, on rented lines, presumably at a discounted rate. The documents filed on behalf of the applicant were identified as either flyers or direct mailings distributed in Canada by a source in the United States.
(ii) CALLING CARD;
CARTE D'APPEL
[82]
The applicant presented evidence of U.S. advertising in which the expression "calling card" was consistently used to describe and refer to the specific long-distance calling card service offered by the advertiser. The applicant suggested I consider this advertising as support for its contention that it is impossible to discuss long-distance service on credit provided through a card issued by or on behalf of the service provider without reference to "calling card" as a descriptive expression.
(iii) 900 SERVICE; LE SERVICE 900
[83]
Advertisements appearing in American magazines widely circulated in Canada referred to the specific service offered by the advertiser, followed by the phrase "900 Service" and a description, for example, "AT&T MultiQuest Service, an interactive 900 Service", or "DIAL-IT 900 Service - A cost-effective way to reach your customers with promotional messages."
(g) Experience and Opinions of
Telecommunication Managers
and Consultants
[84]
As mentioned earlier in these reasons
, the applicant filed numerous affidavits of managers, as well as affidavits of consultants and analysts involved in the telecommunication industry. Following an agreement on edited affidavits from this group, I heard oral argument as to the admissibility of the affidavits as opinion evidence on the ultimate issue. While I found the testimony to be admissible, I reserved on the question of the weight to be given to the evidence. I am not satisfied that this is expert evidence. In general, the testimony of these affiants is to the effect that, in their experience, the marks are used and understood by those they work with and others in a generic sense, are used descriptively, and are not linked to any particular source. An example of the phrasing which is similar in all of the affidavits is the following:
"The terms [WATS, INWATS, OUT-WATS, CALLING CARD, 800 PLUS, 900 SERVICE] referred to above are general or standardized terms used throughout the telecommunications industry when referring to the services to which they relate. The terms are not specific to services offered by individual carriers or telephone companies but instead are merely terms which describe a particular service." (
Telecommunication Managers Affidavits
, filed Sept. 22/94, - In particular, the Affidavit of Greg Hauser)
[85]
The applicant conceded that the value of this evidence was as a supplement to, and elaboration of, its survey evidence. To the extent that I give any weight to this evidence, it is only as such a supplement.
(2) Evidence on Behalf of
the Respondent
[86]
As the burden rests on the applicant to invalidate the registrations, the respondent was not obliged to offer evidence of use in a trademark sense. The focus of the respondent's evidence was its advertising and marketing efforts to a community larger than the telecommunication industry on which the applicant, in part, focussed. The respondent argued that, as the applicant had applied to register its own marks relating to 800 and 900 SERVICE, it was estopped from arguing the invalidity of the respondent's version of equivalent marks. Finally, the respondent filed evidence to demonstrate that it is not normal or standard practice in the telecommunications industry in Canada to identify trademarks as such in industry correspondence or in information in telephone directories.
(a) Advertising and Marketing Efforts
[87]
The respondent filed evidence of both print and television marketing of all of its marks to what may be termed an undifferentiated audience, that is to say, the general public. The marketing was in both English and French. For the mark WATS, the respondent advertised on television in Ontario and Quebec, its service area, throughout 1990 and 1991, in both English and French. Registered users MTS, Island Tel, AGT, NBTel, and Nfld Tel, promoted WATS service in their respective areas with similar commercials broadcast in 1990 and 1991. In April of 1991, subsequent to the filing of this application, television advertisements by the respondent for 800 PLUS were broadcast. While the exposure to these commercials is estimated as "impressions", which is not the number of people but rather the total number of times the image was viewed, given the commercials were aired on both major Canadian television networks in the morning, late evening and at prime time, I conclude that the exposure was significant and broad. The majority of the advertisements were prior to the date this application was filed.
[88]
For the marks WATS and 900 SERVICE, the respondent advertised in magazines in 1986 in English throughout Canada and in French throughout Quebec and New Brunswick. While the French language advertisements identified WATS as a trademark of Bell Canada, the English advertisement did not. In the years 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991, the respondent advertised the marks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL in English and French language magazines. In 1989, advertisements were displayed on buses in Quebec and from 1987 to 1990, advertisements were displayed in telephone booths in Ontario and Quebec. In 1990, the advertising extended to hotel and airport billboards in Ontario as well as to enclosures in billings to Bell Canada customers. Similar advertising efforts occurred in 1990 and 1991 with respect to 800 PLUS, a mark identified in the advertising as a trademark. The mark OUTWATS was identified as a trademark in press releases by the respondent in both English and French in 1987. The marks 900 SERVICE, LE SERVICE 900 and 800 PLUS were used in brochures distributed by the respondent to clients in 1989 and 1991. The three marks were identified as trademarks in the brochures.
[89]
While the majority of the respondent's advertising was directed at businesses, it certainly was not exclusively so directed. The television audience was no doubt a wider community, as were the readers of nonfinancial, wide-distribution news magazines. Some of the advertising was specifically targeted at the general public, such as the magazine advertisements for CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL depicting the use of the service by an individual or individuals on vacation.
(b) Lexicographic Evidence
[90]
The respondent offered a Mr. Scargill as an expert on "Canadian English". I am satisfied as to his qualifications as such. Mr. Scargill's affidavit evidence was to the effect that English language usage has evolved differently in Canada from usage in other English speaking nations and usage or recognition of terms outside of Canada cannot therefore be relevant to usage or recognition within Canada. As for specific terms, Mr. Scargill expressed the opinion that "calling card" continues in Canada to identify a visiting or business card and that WATS is not a term in the English language and as such cannot be descriptive of any service.
(c) Applicant's Use of its Trademarks
[91]
The respondent pointed to the applicant's success in registering the marks "1-900 SERVICE" and "1-800 SERVICE" as evidence that the marks 800 PLUS, 900 SERVICE and LE SERVICE 900 must be equally valid. The respondent submitted that the applicant is estopped from arguing the invalidity of the respondent's marks by its own behaviour. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .) The respondent filed evidence of the applicant's use of its marks in a similar manner to the use by the respondent of its marks, use which the applicant relies on as evidence of descriptive or non-distinctive use. In tariffs filed by the applicant, many of its trademarks were not identified as owned by Unitel, were paired with nouns and were incorporated into sentences descriptive of the service with which they were associated. (Certified Record, v. 21, T. 27 - Affidavit of Charles Kinsey Dillane) Yellow pages also revealed the use by nonregistered users of Unitel's mark TELEX in exactly the same manner as the usage of the respondent marks WATS, INWATS and OUTWATS in similar context. (Certified Record, v. 15, T. 14 - Affidavit of Debra-Lynn Montgomery)
7. Survey Evidence
(1) On Behalf of the Applicant
[92]
The applicant presented a survey and a supplementary survey designed by Professor Roger Heeler, an expert in statistical surveys, and conducted by professional interviewers employed by Decima Research. (Certified Record - v. 16, T. 34 and 35 - Affidavits of Roger Heeler) The initial survey response rate of 54% was supplemented by an identical follow-up survey which increased the response rate to 65%. The combined sample was based on 465 businesses randomly selected from a computerized list, in turn based on previous research of the Canadian long-distance market conducted by Decima Research which revealed that businesses with under five employees did not use the long-distance services offered under the respondent's trademarks at issue to any significant degree. For this reason, such businesses were omitted from the survey with the resulting sample divided equally between large businesses, those with over 200 employees, and small and medium businesses, those with between 5 and 149 employees. There was no indication that the businesses included public sector operations such as hospitals, schools, universities, police forces or municipal or other governmental organizations.
[93]
The applicant's survey interviewees were identified on the basis of a request by the interviewer to speak with the person responsible for making decisions about the purchase of telephone services. During the course of the hearing I expressed concern that the managers surveyed would not, in reality, make purchasing decisions but in fact would be responsible for evaluating proposals or packages of telephone services and making recommendations to senior management, particularly in large businesses.
[94]
The survey questionnaire consisted of a threshold question testing the familiarity of the interviewee with the marks at issue. Only those who described themselves as somewhat or very familiar with a mark at issue were asked the following two questions: "What does (the mark) mean to you?" and "Which of the following statements is closer to the truth: (the mark) is a general term for a type of telecommunications service, or (the mark) is a brand name for a service performed by a specific company, or neither." The terms used were the respondent's trademarks WATS, CALLING CARD and 900 SERVICE, an invented word, Digicomm, the generic term, "fax", and the brand name, CANTEL.
[95]
When asked what the survey terms meant to them, the majority of interviewees described the service related to the particular term used. For example, approximately 77% responded that WATS meant a variety of toll-free, fixed or reduced rate calling or long distance service, with 8% specifying "wide area telephone service". Less than 2% mentioned a brand name or particular company as part of the meaning of the respondent's trademarks included in the survey. Seventy-five percent (75%) stated that CALLING CARD meant a charge or credit card. In contrast, 29% identified a particular company in association with the term "CANTEL" in response to the same question, although 56% mentioned cellular/ mobile telephone. (I note that these figures are from the original survey only). Nineteen percent (19%) mentioned a company in association with the invented term "Digicomm", although the number of respondents was very small.
[96]
When asked whether a term was a general term, a brand name for a service or neither, 83% identified 900 SERVICE as a general term, 75% identified WATS as a general term and 74% identified CALLING CARD as a general term. With respect to the control terms, 90% identified "fax" as a general term and 6% as a brand name, while 27% identified "CANTEL" as a general term and 68% identified it as a brand name. The invented term "Digicomm" received an even split between those who believed it was a brand name and those who believed it was a general term, although the number of respondents who met the familiarity threshold was only 6%.
(2) On Behalf of the Respondent
[97]
The respondent's survey was designed in cooperation with Mr. Ralph Folsom, an American law professor and author in the United States of the "dual understanding" theory of trademark recognition. The survey was conducted under the supervision of Mr. Alain Choinière. (Certified Record, v. 19, T. 1-4) The survey related only to the marks "WATS" and "CALLING CARD" and was conducted in French and English. The sample had a response rate of 770 people for "WATS" (49%) and 778 people for "CALLING CARD" (42%). The survey universe was defined as English-speaking residents over 18 years of age for "CALLING CARD" and persons over 18 years of age who used the telephone or telephone equipment regularly in the course of their work for "WATS". The survey used three terms "CALLING CARD" or "WATS", the brand name "CONTEMPRA" or "TELEX" and the generic term "Television". The interviewer first asked the threshold question "have you ever heard of the
word ... or expression ...
in relation to telecommunications". To those who had heard of the word or expression, the interviewer presented an explanation of the difference between brand names and generic names using the examples "Ford", "Toyota" and "Chrysler" as brand names, "automobiles" as generic and "JEEP" as possibly both a brand name and a generic term for all-terrain vehicles. This explanation was followed by a sample question asking the respondent to classify "KLEENEX" "Facial Tissue" / "Papier Mouchoir" and "FACELLE ROYALE" as brand names, generic terms, both, neither or don't know. Only those who identified "facial tissue" / "papier mouchoir" as a generic term and "FACELLE ROYALE" as a brand name were further interviewed. The remaining sample was asked if they thought each word or expression - "Television", "WATS" or "CALLING CARD" and "TELEX" or "CONTEMPRA" - was a trademark, a generic name or both.
[98]
The results were weighted in the extrapolation of the data to reflect the true population ratio of the region of the respondents. While 88% identified "Television" as a generic term, 10% thought it was both and 2% thought is was a trademark. Sixty-nine percent (69%) identified "CONTEMPRA" as a trademark, 19% as generic and 9% as both. Twenty percent (20%) identified "CALLING CARD" as a trademark, 54% as generic and 24% as both. In interviews using WATS, 91% identified "Television" as a generic term, 3% as a trademark and 7% as both. Seventy-four percent (74%) identified "CONTEMPRA" as a trademark, 16% as a generic term and 7% as both. An additional term "TELEX" (a trademark owned by the applicant) was also used and 27% identified this term as a trademark, 41% as a generic term and 31% as both. The term "WATS" was identified by 24% as a trademark, by 53% as a generic term and by 19% as both.
8. Positions Of The Parties And Analysis
(1) The Relevant Public or Universe
[99]
As indicated earlier, the analysis of whether or not a trademark is descriptive derives from the first impression of the relevant "purchasers", "consuming public" or "universe". With respect to distinctiveness, a similar "universe" acts as the "measuring stick" against which evidence of use is analyzed.
[100]
The applicant referred me to a number of decisions to support its contention that the universe against which descriptiveness and distinctiveness of the trademarks at issue should be evaluated is, in the words of Heald, J., as he then was, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at 230, "... a substantial portion of the trade using the product, to many and not only a few ..." and, or in the alternative, the purchasers of the services. The applicant further argued that there is U.S. authority for considering a special class of purchasers as the relevant public where the service or product is specialized or technical as, for example, in a decision dismissing a trademark infringement application on the grounds that the mark "386", used to refer to a microprocessing component, was generic. The evidence there at issue was a survey of "... representative persons in charge of purchasing microprocessor components", which a District Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Cal. Dist. Ct., (1991), accepted as the relevant public.
[101]
In reliance on its position, the applicant's survey was directed to a universe of telecommunication managers in large and medium-sized companies rather than to the general public. Similarly, as discussed earlier, the applicant filed a number of affidavits of telecommunication managers and consultants.
[102]
The respondent agreed that the relevant public is the consuming or purchasing public but maintained that, with respect to the telecommunication services in association with which the trademarks at issue are registered, the consuming or purchasing public is the general public. The respondent cited a recent decision in the Supreme Court of Canada overturning a lower court finding that the relevant public for pharmaceutical drugs was pharmacists and doctors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 321; 44 C.P.R.(3d) 289, the Supreme Court held that the relevant public was the general public, despite the evidence that the "purchasing" done by the general public was filtered or limited by the more specialized class of those who prescribed pharmaceutical drugs and those who purchased such drugs and resold them to the general public, namely, doctors and pharmacists. At pages 311 and 312 C.P.R., Gonthier, J., speaking for the court, wrote:
"As I mentioned earlier, a manufacturer that wishes to succeed in a passing-off action must usually show that its product has acquired a secondary meaning with its customers, the public, and that the competing product is likely to create a risk of confusion in the public mind. There is no reason for the approach to be any different when the producer or manufacturer is a pharmaceutical laboratory. The prescription pharmaceutical products business is not so fundamentally different from other areas of commercial activity that special rules should apply to it. The courts have no reason in law to deprive pharmaceutical laboratories of means of proof available to other industries.
"With the greatest possible respect, following the Court of Appeal's reasoning in
Ayerst, McKenna & Harrison
would also ultimately lead to treating the patient as a special kind of consumer: yet the patient needs information and protection just as other consumers do. Not including him in the clientele covered by the passing-off action, in my opinion, divests him of part of his rights as an individual. He is deprived of the means of protecting himself as an informed person."
[103]
Gonthier, J., concluded for the court at page 315 C.P.R. in the following terms:
"There is no reason in law to depart from the well-established rule that the final consumer of a product must be taken into account in determining whether the tort of passing-off has been committed. In the field of prescription drugs, therefore, the customers of pharmaceutical laboratories include physicians, pharmacists, dentists and patients."
[104]
In reliance on its position that the reasoning of the Supreme Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -Geigy
applies equally in this matter, the respondent's survey evidence was based on a survey of a segment of the English-speaking general public in the case of CALLING CARD and of the general public over eighteen years of age that uses the telephone or telephone equipment in the course of work in the case of WATS. The respondent also relied on evidence of its marketing materials, a significant proportion of which were directed at the general public rather than at businesses requiring more sophisticated telecommunication systems and services.
[105]
While this matter is not a passing-off action as was the matter before the Supreme Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -Geigy
, I am satisfied that the principles there enunciated by Gonthier, J., as to the relevant universe in relation to prescription drugs apply equally in this matter to determination of the relevant universe in relation to the trademarks at issue and the telecommunication services for which they are registered. An analogy can be drawn between the telecommunication managers and consultants on whose evidence the applicant relies and doctors and pharmacists in relation to prescription drugs. In each case, they are clearly a part of the relevant universe, but only a relatively small part. The "ultimate consumers" in relation to telecommunication services are those who use the services, not those who advise on or purchase the services on behalf of their employers. This was clearly reflected in the marketing materials of the respondent. To exclude the evidence of these "ultimate consumers" in determining whether the trademarks at issue are descriptive or distinctive would, to paraphrase the words of Gonthier, J. "... lead to treating (these consumers) as a special kind of consumers: yet (these consumers need) information and protection just as other consumers do. Not including (them) in the clientele covered by (this application), in my opinion, divests (them) of part of (their) rights as ... individual(s). (They are) deprived of the means of protecting (themselves) as ... informed person(s)."
[106]
This conclusion is, I am satisfied, supported by the applicant's own evidence of use by third parties of some of the trademarks at issue and other marks for similar services in "yellow pages" advertising that is clearly directed to a broader market than telecommunication managers and consultants.
(2) Admissibility and Weight of
Survey and Certain Other Evidence
[107]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , (Man. C.A.), at 599, Dickson, J.A., as he then was, wrote with respect to survey evidence:
"Basic to the admissibility of such surveys has been the acceptance of public-opinion polling as a science when approved statistical methods, social research techniques, and interview procedures are employed.
"Essential to admissibility is the requirement that the witness testifying be possessed of expert knowledge. Essential also is selection of the proper 'universe', i.e., that segment of the population whose characteristics are relevant to the question being studied. In the case at bar, the 'community' whose standards are being considered is all of Canada. The universe from which the 'sample', i.e., the individuals to be polled, is to be selected must be representative of Canada and not be drawn from a single city. If and only if, the sample is correctly selected can it be said that the opinions found to exist in the sample are representative of the entire universe."
[108]
I am satisfied that the foregoing statement is fully applicable in this matter, and is telling both with respect to the survey and related evidence of the applicant and the survey evidence of the respondent.
[109]
The respondent contends that the applicant's survey is inadmissible as it was based on the wrong universe. In support of this proposition the respondent referred me to the
Prairie Schooner
case, in which survey evidence not based on the "proper universe" was rejected. In the alternative, the respondent argued that the applicant's survey evidence should be given little, if any, weight as was done, relying on the
Prairie Schooner
decision, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Alta. L.R.(3d) 146 (Q.B.)). Mr. Bennett, a marketing expert, and Mr. Scargill, a lexicographer, in their affidavit evidence, urged the same result. They took the position that the applicant's survey evidence ignored the vast majority of potential users and, to a lesser extent, purchasers of services to which the marks at issue related and, in the result, revealed nothing of the perception of the relevant universe in relation to the marks at issue. (Certified Record, v. 19, T. 5 - Affidavit of Roger Bennett)
[110]
The jurisprudence relied on by the respondent is not on all fours when applied to the survey evidence before me except with respect to the general statement quoted above. In
Prairie Schooner
, the rejection of the survey evidence was on the basis that the sample surveyed was not a "scientifically selected sample within an accepted universe", that is to say, it was not
representative
of the appropriate universe, in a statistical sense. The sample universe was also unrepresentative of the Canadian population in that the groups chosen to be surveyed, an evening university class and a group of C.N.R. employees, were, once again in the words of Dickson, J.A., "minuscule and parochial". That is not the case here. In
Walt Disney
, the issue again was "whether, on the evidence before me the sample is statistically representative of the Canadian universe that Dr. Senders purported to survey and measure." Such is not the case with the applicant's survey. In this matter there was genuine debate over the selection of the universe rather than a flaw in the actual sample when evaluated against the appropriate universe selected.
[111]
This being said, the respondent did have several concerns with the actual design and conduct of the survey, which, in the opinion of the respondent's survey expert Alain Choinière, rendered the applicant's survey "inaccurate and therefore, unusable." Mr. Choinière first took issue with the screening question which used the subjective concept of "familiarity" rather than the question "Have you ever heard ..." and in consequence eliminated some participants with an effect not possible to estimate. Mr. Choinière also criticized the use of "term" instead of "word or expression" to describe the marks, as, in his opinion, "term" suggests a generic use while "word" and "expression" are more neutral. According to Mr. Choinière, by linking "term" with the marks at issue, the applicant's survey may have suggested to some survey respondents that the marks covered in the survey were generic given that one of the response categories was "general term". Mr. Choinière further took issue with the categories "general term" and "brand name" as subjective, without an explanation to establish a common understanding among the survey respondents. In support of this contention, Mr. Choinière pointed out that with respect to "CANTEL", 13 of the 58 respondents (almost 25%) who identified "CANTEL" as a company proceeded to classify it as a "general term". Mr. Choinière also took issue with the question "what does ... mean to you" which suggests that a description is sought, in contrast to "what comes to mind when ..." which would have left a broader response field. Finally, Mr. Choinière's calculations do not support the 65% response rate the applicant claims was the result when the supplemental survey is taken into account.
[112]
With respect to the respondent's survey evidence, the applicant first suggests that, while the respondent's own survey expert, Mr. Folsom, admitted on cross-examination that the relevant universe for the marks at issue is "those who may ultimately rely on the trademarked word in purchasing decisions", its survey intentionally excluded the business community. (This is not the case. In fact only business telephone numbers were excluded.) The same expert also admitted that a properly designed survey should ascertain that the respondent understands the meaning of the word or expression in question, as did that of the applicant, an opinion in direct contradiction of the position of Mr. Choinière. The applicant submitted that it is unacceptable to suggest to those surveyed that a word or expression can have a dual-meaning in light of the admissions by the respondent's experts that there is no empirical evidence to support this proposition as applied to either the respondent's screening question using "KLEENEX" or the example using "JEEP". Moreover, the applicant argued that the dual-meaning concept itself is too complex to allow for an accurate assessment of the responses, given that approximately 34% of the CALLING CARD survey group and 71% of the WATS survey group did not understand the explanation of the dual-meaning theory and were eliminated from the survey. Finally, the applicant pointed out that in respondent's survey, those surveyed were not given the choice of answering "I don't know" which the respondent's expert, Mr. Folsom, admitted should have been provided.
[113]
In regard to the results of the respondent's survey, the applicant noted that although some survey respondents indicated they associated a particular source with the word or expression at issue, there was no indication that they associated the respondent as this source, that is to say, that the marks are distinctive of the respondent Bell Canada.
[114]
The applicant further argued that the universe sampled was chosen by the respondent rather than by qualified expert surveyors and was inappropriate given that 24% of the population of Canada (to which the results were extrapolated) live in provinces where the major telecommunication service providers of CALLING CARD services were not registered users with no indication that those who identified the expression as a trademark in fact associated it with Bell Canada and not a telecommunication company serving their province or region.
[115]
Also notably, there were only ten interviews in Quebec, not, in the submission of the applicant, a meaningful representation for statistical purposes and significant given the weighting accorded to the responses based on the population ratios.
[116]
I am simply not satisfied that the survey evidence adduced before me is of significant probative value in the case of the applicant's survey evidence, and of any probative value in the case of the respondent's survey evidence.
[117]
As indicated earlier, I conclude that the applicant's survey was directed to only a small portion of the relevant universe, and that an unrepresentative portion. As Dickson, J.A., stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  found to exist in the sample are representative of the entire universe." In a technical sense, I find nothing "incorrect" in the selection of the sample from the universe identified. But the universe identified was not the correct universe in relation to the services and the trademarks here at issue. In the result, the opinions found to exist in the sample are simply not representative of the relevant universe.
[118]
Can the applicant's survey evidence, nonetheless, be of
some
probative value? I conclude that it can, although that probative value is slight. I find the applicant's survey evidence to be a reasonable reflection of the opinion of a sub-set, and a rather small and specialized sub-set, of the relevant universe in relation to the trademarks at issue.
[119]
As I indicated earlier in these reasons under subheading 6(1)(g), Experience and Opinions of Telecommunication Managers and Consultants, the applicant conceded that the value of the evidence of these affiants was as a supplement to, and elaboration of, its survey evidence. I indicated that it was only as such a supplement that I would give any weight to this evidence. Given my conclusion as to the weight to be afforded the applicant's survey evidence, I give no greater weight to the evidence of the telecommunication managers and consultants than I give to the applicant's survey evidence.
[120]
I turn then to the respondent's survey evidence. I confess an attraction to the dual-meaning theory and find the efforts of the respondent to establish it through survey evidence to be intriguing. But I can go no further than that. The transcript of the cross-examination of the respondent's survey expert, Mr. Folsom, discloses the degree to which he was relieved of control of the design of the survey. I return again to the quotation above from Dickson, J.A., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  public-opinion poling as a
science
when approved statistical methods, social research techniques, and interview procedures are employed." I conclude that the range of variations from "approved" methods, techniques and procedures, combined in particular with the lack of geographical representation in the sample employed, are such that the respondent's survey evidence is simply inadmissible.
(3) Alleged False Declarations
[121]
As indicated earlier in these reasons, the trademarks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL were applied for and registered in the name of Transcanada Telephone System, a predecessor of Stentor. TCTS filed declarations of use of the trademarks on June 23, 1983 and September 13, 1983, respectively. Counsel for the respondent acknowledged before me that Stentor and its predecessors never directly provided telecommunication services. Most of the Stentor members were eventually registered as registered users, along with many other telecommunication service providers, but only some years after the registration of the marks. Notably missing as registered users were BCTel, SaskTel and Nfld Tel. On August 26, 1988, the respondent became the registered owner of the two trademarks.
[122]
Section 40(2) of the
Act
as it read until June 9, 1993, quoted earlier in these reasons, is repeated here for ease of reference:
"(2) When an application for registration of a proposed trademark is allowed, the Registrar shall give notice to the applicant accordingly and shall register the trademark and issue a certificate of its registration on receipt of a declaration that the applicant, his successor in title or a person approved as a registered user has commenced the use of the trademark in Canada in association with the wares or services specified in the application."
[123]
In
The Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition
, Harold G. Fox, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1972), at pages 252 and 253, it is stated:
"It is provided, in s. 18(1), that the registration of a trademark is invalid if ... subject to s. 17, ... the applicant for registration was not the person entitled to secure the registration. There is, however, no provision in the
Act
under which mis-statements in an application for registration ... become grounds for invalidating the registration unless the mis-statements had the effect of making the trademark not registrable under s. 12 of the
Act
or unless there was a fraudulent misrepresentation
." (Underlining added by me for emphasis)
For this proposition, the learned author cites two cases reported in 1964 and 1970. The respondent preferred to rely on United States authority as support for the proposition. I was referred to
McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition
, J. Thomas McCarthy, 3rd ed. (Illinois and New York: Clark Bordman Callaghan. release #2, 4/1994), and to three cases, the most pertinent of which I found to be
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Markey, C.J., in the context of a patent infringement matter, stated at page 1389:
"Inequitable conduct resides in failure to disclose material information, or submission of false material information, with an intent to deceive, and those two elements, materiality and intent, must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.
. . . . .
"'To be guilty of inequitable conduct, one must have intended to act inequitably.'"
Chief Justice Markey continued on the same page:
"The District Court inferred intent based on what is perceived to be Kingsdown's gross negligence. Whether the intent element of inequitable conduct is present cannot always be inferred from a pattern of conduct that may be described as gross negligence. That conduct must be sufficient to require a finding of deceitful intent in the light of all the circumstances."
The court went on to indicate that it was not convinced that deceitful intent was present  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's negligent filing or that its conduct rose to a level that would warrant the description "gross negligence".
[124]
At page 922 of the transcript of the hearing before me, Counsel for the respondent is reported as having stated:
"On the issue of false declaration, I think I should say quite honestly to respond to any of your concerns, that Trans-Canada Telephone System or Telecom Canada, as it is now known, never itself provided the services, specifically the services which were known under the trademarks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL."
[125]
Counsel referred me to statements in the applications for registration of the two trademarks signed on behalf of Trans-Canada Telephone System to the effect that the applicant intended to use the trademarks in Canada in association with the services for which they were ultimately registered. Further, in declarations of use, TCTS declared that it had commenced use of the trademarks in Canada in association with the same services.
[126]
Counsel for the applicant argued that the United States case law cited to me on behalf of the respondent should not be relied on where it arises out of patent matters and is irrelevant as it relates to trademark matters since the
United States Federal Trade-Mark Act
of 1946 as amended (the
Lanham Act
) provided at all relevant times for cancellation of the registration of a trademark where its registration was "... obtained fraudulently". Thus, in contrast to the Canadian regime, fraud is an element of the statutory test for cancellation or expungement in the United States.
[127]
Counsel for the applicant referred me to the two cases cited for the proposition from the
Canadian Law of Trade-Marks and Unfair Competition
cited above. The first is
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  distinguishable because the statement there alleged to be a misrepresentation did not go to a fundamental issue in the registration of the trademark. It actually related to an application for extension of wares in respect of a trademark the original registration for which was not challenged. By contrast, in the second case,
W.J. Hughes & Sons " <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  trademark of the design in question had no intention of using the design for trademark purposes, despite the fact that it stated such an intention in the application for registration. He found that intention to be one of the bases for valid registration. In the result, on the basis of the misrepresentation, among other reasons, the court indicated that an order would go declaring that the trademark registration was, and always had been, void and invalid and that the registration should be struck out.
[128]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that the defendant before applying for registration did not use the trademark in association with wares, and it should not, therefore, have been granted and should be struck out.
"It is admitted that the defendant did not use the trademark in association with the wares either before registration or until nearly a year after registration of the mark for the reasons already set out."
At page 33, the learned judge continued:
"Whatever may be or may have been the position under other
Acts
, in my opinion the whole scheme of the
Act
is based on the acquisition of a trademark right by use. And in my opinion such right cannot be acquired by registration made under the
Act
before use for the simple reason that valid registration cannot be obtained unless there has been 'use'.
"Registration under the statute merely serves to confirm the title, which has already been established by use."
Finally, at page 35, the learned judge stated:
"Only by making a statement that was not true could he obtain registration, because if he stated that there had been no use of the mark, the application would be refused because under the
Act
'use' as defined by s. 6 is clearly a condition precedent. (The reference to section 6 is, in the context of this matter, a reference to subsection 4(2).)
. . . . .
"The entry as it appears on the Register does not, in my opinion, accurately express or define the existing rights of the defendant."
[129]
Finally, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), a case involving proposed use trademarks as with the two trademarks here at issue, Addy, J., after concluding that the affidavit of use was "not untruthful" but was nonetheless inaccurate, concluded that:
"The subsequent assignment cannot cure the defect since the assignor had nothing to assign. T-Fal Corporation of New York was not the owner of a valid mark and had no title whatsoever to the T-FAL mark in Canada. The registration was void ab initio: it was obtained on misleading evidence and the true facts establish a complete absence of right in the assignor to any mark;
nemo dat quod non habet
."
[130]
By analogy, it was argued that subsequent registration of registered users who had in fact used the marks here at issue could not cure the defect.
[131]
I conclude that neither fraud nor intent to deceive is a necessary element where an application for registration of a trademark and a declaration of use in Canada both contain material false statements. The statement of intent to use contained in the applications for registration of the trademarks here at issue and the declarations of use were simply false, whatever the intent and understanding of the applicant for registration might have been. Further, the statement of intent in the application and the declaration of use were both fundamental to the registration of the trademarks. As in the
T-FAL
case quoted above, I conclude that the registrations of the marks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL were void ab initio. In the event that I may be wrong in this conclusion, I will continue to examine these trademarks, along with the other trademarks at issue, with respect to the questions of whether they were registrable at the dates of registration and whether they were distinctive.
(4) Were the Trademarks at Issue
Registrable at the Date of Registration?
(a) Clearly Descriptive:
Paragraph 12(1)(b)
[132]
In order to be clearly descriptive, a mark must be more than merely suggestive of the character or quality of the wares or services in association with which it is used or proposed to be used. The descriptive character must go to the material composition of the goods or services or refer to an intrinsic quality of the goods or services which are the subject of the trademark. The test is the immediate or first impression formed. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), affd. (1979), 22 N.R. 529; 40 C.P.R.(2d) 288 (F.C.A.); relied on in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 103 (F.C.A.).) As indicated earlier, the applicant and the respondent were of dramatically different views as to whose first impression the court should look. (See the analysis with respect to "relevant universe" earlier.)
[133]
The applicant referred to the Supreme Court of Canada's comments on descriptiveness at page 113 in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.):
"In the technique of advertising the more complex and expensive the goods are, the greater the imaginative seeking by those producing them for attractive and arresting words; but in fixing the limits of legislative protection the courts must balance the conflicting interests and avoid placing legitimate competition at an undue disadvantage in relation to language that is common to all."
[134]
The applicant pointed to jurisprudence which examined the context of the use of a trademark in an analysis of descriptiveness; in particular, several decisions on trademarks for telecommunication wares or services were referred to.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), Dubé, J., confirmed rejection of an application to register the mark SUPERSET for telephone instruments as clearly descriptive, noting at page 208 that while the word "set" "... awakens many and diverse first impressions":
"... in a telephone store, or glancing at advertisements of telephone sales, a customer would probably link the mark SUPERSET to the telephone sets on display and form the impression that the telephones offered for sale are of a superior quality. Much as other people would link SUPERWASH to garments that wash superbly well, or SUPERSET (in association with tools) to tools that function in a superior way, or SUPER-WEAVE to superfine textile. In short, the mark is not to be considered in isolation; it must be perceived in connection to the wares to which it is associated." (Also see the discussion on "Call Following" in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M. Opp. Bd.))
[135]
The applicant further relied on jurisprudence to the effect that elliptical terms or terms where common words can be "read in", for example "OFF" for insect repellent [see footnote 4], abbreviations [see footnote 5] and acronyms and related derivatives, for example "PROM" as a derivative of "ROM" [see footnote 6], all have been found to be descriptive.
[136]
The respondent referred me to many cases in which the court did not expunge trademarks which made use of what are essentially ordinary words, such as "SCOOP 'N BAKE", "KEYCARD" and "LP" [see footnote 7] (allegedly for low pain).
(b) The Name of the Service:
Paragraph 12(1)(c)
[137]
Counsel advised me that there is little jurisprudence on s. 12(1)(c) of the
Act
, but they were in agreement that the prohibition on the use of the name in any language is narrower than that on the use of descriptive terms as noted in the only case cited to me [see footnote 8] on paragraph 12(1)(c). Neither counsel pursued this ground in any depth and, in fact, counsel for the applicant preferred to link any analysis on this ground with the ground of distinctiveness which I will address later.
(c) Prohibited Marks: Paragraph
12(1)(e) and Section 10
[138]
Paragraph 12(1)(e) and s. 10 of the
Act
must be read in conjunction with s. 3 which reads as follows:
"3. A trademark is deemed to have been adopted by a person when that person or his predecessor in title commenced to use it in Canada or to make it known in Canada or, if that person or his predecessor in title had not previously so used it or made it known, when that person or his predecessor file an application for its registration in Canada."
[139]
Clearly the statutory prohibition requires that the use of the mark in question be in Canada and that the mark must have become recognized in Canada as designating an aspect of the wares or services which are the subject of the mark. The applicant characterized the prohibition in s. 10 as being against a mark that has become generic, that is to say, against a mark that, by reason of "ordinary and bona fide commercial usage", has become a generic term in respect of the goods or services to which the use has related. Again, the applicant linked this conceptually to the ground of distinctiveness which is discussed below.
(5) Were The Trademarks Distinctive?
[140]
For ease of reference, I quote once again the relevant portions of subsection 18(1) and section 2 of the
Act
:
"18(1) The registration of a trademark is invalid if
. . . . .
(b) the trademark is not distinctive at the time proceedings bringing the validity of the registration into question are commenced ...
. . . . .
"'distinctive', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted to so distinguish them;"
[141]
The applicant relies on two types of use to establish that the marks were not distinctive as of March 25, 1991, the day this proceeding was commenced; first, descriptive use by the respondent and authorized users; and second, unauthorized use by third parties. The applicant submits that the use by the respondent, as well as the failure by the respondent to "manage" and to "police" its marks, has rendered identification of the source of the services problematic and thus the marks non-distinctive of the services of the respondent and any registered users. The applicant referred me to jurisprudence to establish that the test of distinctiveness is the "primary significance" to the relevant consuming or purchasing public rather than the availability of other terms to describe the services to which the marks at issue apply. Further, the applicant argues that the registered user regime in place at the time this application was brought existed to enforce the distinctiveness requirement of a valid trademark and consistent and extensive unauthorized use by parties not validly registered as users eroded distinctiveness to the point where it ceased to exist.
[142]
The jurisprudence relied on by the applicant suggests that permitted use should be strictly construed to effect the purpose of the registered user regime. The Federal Court of Appeal stated in
Moore  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 40, at page 49 C.P.R.:
"Since distinctiveness of a mark is, inter alia, related to source, when the trademark is related to more than one source, it cannot be distinctive."
[143]
The respondent referred to the statement of McNair, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) where, at page 266, he wrote:
"There is a principle running through the cases to the effect that the wrongful use, or what might perhaps be better termed abuse, of another's registered trademark does not afford a valid basis for attacking the distinctiveness of such trademark ... [citations omitted] In the
Mastertune
case, the applicant sought to expunge the respondent's trademark registrations for automotive wares and services. The court held that the registrations were invalid as to services and valid as to the wares. Cattanach, J., said at p. 144:
'The owner of a trademark may lose his exclusive right in the mark if he permits the widespread use of it by rival traders either by concurrence or negative action. In that event the trademark ceases to be distinctive of the owner's wares or services ...
But an owner does not lose his rights in his trademark because someone infringes his rights.
'
"This statement of the learned judge received the tacit approval, at least, of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  persuasive case on this point to be
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Court decision in that case which, according to counsel before me, went on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada but was there, unfortunately, dismissed for want of prosecution due to the loss of the hearing transcripts. The applicant suggests I take from this case the principle that evidence of undifferentiated use, even where no survey of the relevant public is before the court, will lead to a finding that the impugned mark is generic. The applicant distinguished the court's refusal in that case to expunge the trademark "THERMOS" on five discrete findings of fact not evident on the facts before me: (i) the long life of the mark; (ii) the respect for exclusivity shown by competitors; (iii) the mark was not taken out of the vocabulary of the trade but rather was a coined term; (iv) the mark was still recognized as a trademark by a small segment of the public; and (v) there was real risk of public harm and confusion if the mark were expunged.
[145]
The respondent argued that
Aladdin Industries
stands for the proposition that, in Canadian law, the "dual meaning theory", that is, the concept that a trademark can be understood by the relevant public to have both a generic and a trademark sense, particularly where the mark is used in commercial discourse in a descriptive sense over a lengthy period of time, is valid law. The respondent notes in this context the difference in Canadian and American jurisprudence, illustrated by the expungement of the mark THERMOS in almost identical proceedings in the United States (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Dist. Ct.)). The respondent cited a series of cases which it interprets as relying on the dual meaning theory established in
Aladdin Industries
. I find none of the cited cases to be helpful on the issue of the status of the dual-meaning theory in Canadian trademark law. I again express some regret that the respondent's survey evidence was such that I found it to be inadmissible. Without admissible survey evidence on the question, I conclude that there simply is insufficient evidence before me to support an argument that any of the trademarks at issue had an established dual-meaning at the time of commencement of this proceeding. This despite the fact that I am inclined to the view that in an industry such as the telecommunication industry, with a highly knowledgeable technical élite element in its market and a much broader, less knowledgeable element, dual-meaning in some or all of the marks is a distinct possibility.
(6) Issues Related to Registrability and
Distinctiveness
(a) Registered Users and Licensing
[146]
With respect to the trademarks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL, fifty-one (51) registered users were registered before 1991. One additional registered user was registered with respect to CALLING CARD in 1991 and before the date this proceeding was commenced. Of note, is that three members of Stentor were never registered with respect to either of these trademarks. They are BCTel, SaskTel, and Nfld Tel. All members of Stentor other than the respondent and Telesat were registered as registered users of WATS and OUTWATS prior to the commencement of this proceeding. Once again at the commencement of this proceeding, no registered users were registered in respect of INWATS, 900 SERVICE, LE SERVICE 900 and 800 PLUS.
[147]
At all times relevant to this proceeding before June 9, 1993, ss. 50(1) to (3) of the
Act
read as follows:
"50(1) A person other than the owner of a registered trademark may be registered as a registered user thereof for all or any of the wares or services for which it is registered.
"50(2) The use of a registered trademark by a registered user thereof in accordance with the terms of his registration as such in association with wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him, or the use of a proposed trademark as provided in subsection 40(2) by a person approved as a registered user thereof, is in this section referred to as the 'permitted use' of the trademark.
"50(3) The permitted use of a trademark has the same effect for all purposes of this Act as a use thereof by the registered owner."
[148]
Effective June 9, 1993, section 50 was repealed and replaced. As a result, subsections 50(1) and (2) now read as follows:
"50(1) For the purpose of this Act, if an entity is licensed by or with the authority of the owner of a trademark to use the trademark in a country and the owner has, under the licence,
direct or indirect control of the character or quality of the wares or services
, then the use, advertisement, or display of the trademark in that country as or in a trademark, trade name or otherwise by that entity has,
and is deemed always
to have had
, the same effect as such a use, advertisement or display of the trademark in that country by the owner.
"50(2) For the purposes of this Act, to the extent that public notice is given of the fact that use of a trademark is a licensed use and of the identity of the owner, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proven, that the use is licensed by the owner of the trademark and the character or quality of the wares or services is under the control of the owner." (Underlining added by me for emphasis)
[149]
Counsel for the applicant described the earlier version of s. 50 as providing that use by a registered user inured to the benefit of the owner of the trademark. By contrast, he described the current provision as establishing a different regime that creates a greater burden on the owner of a trademark in a proceeding such as this. Registration is no longer required but licensed use will only inure to the benefit of the licensor where the licensor can establish direct or indirect control of the character or quality of the wares or services in association with which the trademark is licensed. If the greater burden is discharged, use by the licensee has the same effect, and is deemed always to have had the same effect, as use by the registered owner. Thus, an issue before me is, if licensing agreements with respect to the trademarks in issue were entered into after June 8, 1993 that provide for direct or indirect control of the character or quality of the services covered by the marks, does use under the licence cure any defect that may have existed at the time this proceeding was commenced, by virtue of a defect in the registration of registered users, with a consequent effect on distinctiveness.
[150]
Counsel for the applicant argued that, whichever regime prevailed, the result was the same. The evidence disclosed, he argued, use outside the registered user regime sufficient to destroy the distinctiveness of all of the marks. Equally, the evidence disclosed use outside of a licensing regime also sufficient to destroy distinctiveness or, in the alternative, the respondent was unable to demonstrate a licensing regime that provided the degree of control required by the reenacted s. 50(1) or the public notice that, under s. 50(2), would lead to a presumption of the required control.
[151]
In the
Motel 6
case (supra, para. [31]), a case arising under the registered user scheme, Mr. Justice Addy stated at page 62:
"The plaintiff also pleaded that the defendant's mark had lost its distinctiveness by reason of the licensing of the mark to other users without any registration. Unregistered user results in the mark losing its distinctiveness. This is inherent to the entire scheme of our
Trade Marks Act
, (citation omitted) which differs in this respect from the British Act.
"The provision as to registration must be strictly complied with.
. . . . .
"The permitted use under s. 49(3) of the
Trade Marks Act
(s. 50(3) at the time this proceeding was instituted) is an exception to the former rule that a mark could only be used by its owner and the section therefore must be strictly construed both as to substantive law and as to the procedures laid down therein."
[152]
Richard D. French, vice-president, Government and Regulatory Affairs for the respondent, swore to the following in an affidavit filed in this matter:
"Bell Canada has authorized other members of Telecom Canada to use the trademarks referred to above (the trademarks here in issue) in association with the services also referred to above with the understanding that all the other members of Telecom Canada (now Stentor) shall be recorded as registered users of the various trademark registrations in the Canadian Trademarks Office. Through oversight not all of the licensees were recorded as registered users. I am advised that appropriate applications are being filed."
[153]
No written authorizations or licences were provided to support this evidence. Evidence of applications to record a range of registered users in respect of the trademarks at issue in June of 1991 was filed but those applications were apparently not pursued to registration.
[154]
A traffic agreement filed as Exhibit R.1 in this matter by agreement of the parties and by virtue of my order of October 7, 1994, added very little, if anything, to support the respondent's position. The agreement of the parties extended to an acknowledgement that traffic agreements similar in form and content existed at the time of commencement of this proceeding between the respondent and all except four of the independent telephone companies operating in the respondent's service area.
[155]
The respondent relies on the traffic agreement filed and similar agreements to establish an implied licence in that those users not registered were licensees of the marks at issue. The respondent submits that this is significant in the context of both the registered user regime, as the failure to register these licensees is mitigated by the licensing agreements, and, more particularly, in the context of the current licensing regime under s. 50(1) in light of U.S. case law finding licensed use where even an implied licence is shown. In this regard the respondent points specifically to paragraph 4 of the traffic agreement:
"4(a) Each party shall, by itself or through others, so construct, equip and maintain its system that the telecommunication service furnished will at all times conform to the generally accepted standards for communications throughout North America and each shall, by itself or through others, furnish those facilities required to ensure the appropriate routing of local and long distance messages;"
[156]
The respondent acknowledged that the agreement on its face does not discuss trademarks. However, the respondent suggests I take from the agreement an implied licence sufficient to meet the requirements of s. 50(1) as it now reads, in light of the nature of the industry, that is, a regulated industry, and given that the agreement clearly structures the provision of the services in association with which the marks are used and specifically discusses OUTWATS and 900 SERVICE.
[157]
The applicant argues that the agreement merely establishes revenue sharing arrangements and is entirely reciprocal. The applicant further argues that this reciprocity does not meet the requirement that the respondent "control the character or quality of the ... services" that is set out in s. 50(1).
[158]
I am satisfied that the applicant's characterization of the agreement is entirely accurate. The agreement addresses itself entirely to revenue sharing arrangements and, except for paragraph 7 allowing "rates and regulations as Bell Canada shall from time to time establish or adopt", the agreement provides mutual obligations and benefits by use of the phrase "each party shall ...". In this regard I note paragraph 11:
"
Each party shall
, upon request,
furnish the other
with all necessary information ...
for determining the quality of the service rendered
to the public in connection with the communications interchanged hereunder ..." (Underlining added by me for emphasis)
[159]
This paragraph comes closest to any agreement on the quality of the services in association with which the respondent's marks are registered and it is clear from its phrasing that the respondent is not in any position to direct or exercise any control to determine the quality of the service rendered by the independent telephone company. Thus, regardless of whether the registered user or licensing provisions of the
Act
apply, the traffic agreements relied on by the respondent are a less than persuasive rebuttal to evidence of any unauthorized use by telecommunication companies of the respondent's marks shown by the applicant in support of this application.
[160]
Counsel for the respondent argued that, in order to prove non-distinctiveness arising out of use by persons who are not registered users and who are not licensed, public deception must be established.
[161]
For this proposition, counsel referred me to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stated:
"Registration (of a registered user) is not mandatory but in order to benefit from the statutory protection given to owners and to those using the mark under license, it would have been preferable to register the use at the risk of losing the mark's distinctiveness and invalidating its registration in case of use contrary to the owner's wishes. As regards to the applicant, and in the context of the present proceeding, however, this lack is of little consequence."
[162]
Turning to the licensing regime under s. 50 of the
Act
as it came into effect on June 9, 1993, it was argued on behalf of the respondent that, because to date there is no case law on this provision, reference should be made to case law under an analogous system in the United States. Counsel referred me to a series of cases in the American courts that stand generally for the following propositions. There is a heavy burden on an applicant who attempts to demonstrate improper licensing. The licensing system contemplated under the U.S. regime requires minimal control. The consuming public is to be the judge of whether an owner has abandoned his mark through abandonment of quality control. Implied licensing followed eventually by a licensing agreement is not fatal in the sense of amounting to abandonment. A licensor is entitled to rely on the reputation and integrity of a licensee and on the relationship between the parties.
[163]
In response, the applicant pointed out that there is no requirement in the U.S. legislation that a licensor exercise quality control. This must be contrasted with the new s. 50 of the
Trade-marks Act
(b) Relevant Dates
[164]
The applicant asserts that evidence of descriptive and generic use subsequent to the date of registration, by the respondent and authorized users as well as by unauthorized third parties, is relevant with respect to the issue of distinctiveness. Indeed, subject to the question of weight to be accorded to the evidence, the applicant takes the same position in relation to such evidence of use that post-dates the commencement of this proceeding. Essentially, the applicant argues that evidence which is barred from consideration on an examination of whether the marks are clearly descriptive by reason of being evidence of use after the relevant date in that context, is not barred in an examination of whether the marks are non-distinctive by reason that it is evidence of use after the relevant date in that context.
[165]
In support of its first position, the applicant relies on what it argues is a conceptual "bridge" between descriptiveness and distinctiveness, illustrated by the following quotation relied on by Pigeon, J., speaking for the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 14 (S.C.C.), at page 18:
"... a common English word having reference to the character and quality of the goods cannot be an apt or an appropriate instrument for distinguishing the goods of one trader from those of another. And the mere prefixing of the letter 'O' to such a word as cedar certainly does not make it so distinctive that registration gives to the appellants the right to complain of the use of it by another manufacturer to describe a polish whereof oil of cedar is one of the ingredients."
[166]
The respondent submits that evidence of descriptive use subsequent to the registration of a trademark is barred by statute and that the applicant is attempting to do indirectly what it cannot do directly, that is, raise evidence subsequent to the date of registration while ss. 18(1)(a) and 12(1)(b) invalidate a registration for clear descriptiveness specifically "... at the date of registration". The respondent referred me to the following comments by Cullen, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  states in
Canadian Law of Trade Marks and Unfair Competition
, p. 24:
'No registration is invalid under s. 18 merely because the trademark was not distinctive at the time of registration. It may have acquired distinctiveness at the time proceedings bringing the validity of the registration into question are commenced, in which case it cannot be expunged on the ground of invalidity based upon non-distinctiveness because not only does s. 18(1)(b) provided otherwise but s. 56(1) [now s. 57(1)] allows consideration of validity only at the date of application to strike out or amend."
[167]
Along the same lines, the respondent submits that evidence that a mark is generic, that is, of "everyday and bona fide commercial usage" of the mark, is relevant only to the date of adoption or first use listed in the registration of the mark. Strayer, J., as he then was, noted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  register the mark CANADIAN based on paragraph 12(1)(e) and section 10 of the
Act
:
"It should first be noted that the relevant date for determining the 'ordinary and bona fide commercial usage' of the mark for the purposes of s. 10 would be the date when the applicant first started to use it, namely, November 1959 [citations omitted] ... I respectfully agree with the Registrar that the opponent did not by its opposition evidence adequately establish such a usage of the mark CANADIAN in and before 1959 to establish its clear recognition in Canada as designating the place of origin of beer or any particular beer." (See also the decision of the Trade Mark Opposition Board in
Jordan & Ste. Michelle Cellars Ltd. /  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .)
[168]
The applicant referred me to a subsequent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal addressing the interrelationship of s. 12(1)(e) and s. 9 which the applicant argues supports its position that the relevant date is the date of registration of the mark. Mr. Justice MacGuigan, speaking for the Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 161 (F.C.A.), wrote at page 166 C.P.R.:
"Section 12 of the
Act
, dealing with registration, speaks in the present tense ('a mark of which the adoption is prohibited by section 9'). It therefore renders unregistrable a not yet registered mark the adoption of which would now run afoul of s. 9, even if that mark had been adopted and used prior to the giving of public notice under s. 9.
"In sum, the formulas of the adoption and registration provisions are not parallel. Whatever rights to the use of a mark may flow from its adoption are undisturbed by the subsequent adoption and use of a confusingly similar official mark; the right to register the mark is, however, prohibited from the time of the giving of the public notice.
"However, since what is at issue in the case at bar is not the continued use by the appellant of its trademark, but rather its registration, it is clear from what I have said that it cannot now register the mark. In other words, since its adoption would not be possible now (not since March 5, 1980), its adoption may be said to be now prohibited by s. 9, and thus it falls under the interdiction of s. 12 as to registration."
[169]
In its attempt to distinguish the
Canadian Olympic Association
decision, the respondent noted that the case concerned s. 9 which provides for public notice of the adoption or use of the official marks referred to therein, that the mark at issue had been adopted and used, but the application for registration of the mark occurred subsequent to the public notice of the official mark.
[170]
I am not satisfied that this issue is in any way central to the disposition of this matter.
(c) De Facto Monopoly Context
[171]
The applicant argues that there must be a closer scrutiny of the owner's treatment and use of its trademarks in a monopoly context given that there are no wares or services marketed by others from which to distinguish the owner's wares or services.
[172]
As was noted in both the United States and Canadian challenges to the mark SHREDDED WHEAT, a patent on the manufacturing process for the wares created a monopoly on the wares until its expiration, at which time the mark was determined to be unregistrable. While the U.S. case looked to whether the mark had acquired distinctive secondary meaning, the Privy Council in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , looked to the nature of the use by the patent holder. The Privy Council ruled that SHREDDED WHEAT had always been descriptive as the name of the goods and quoted with approval from
Re Palmer's Trade Mark
(1883), 24 Ch. D. 504, at page 141 of the reported decision as follows:
"I do not mean to say that a manufacturer of a patented article cannot have a trademark not descriptive of the patented article so as to be entitled to the exclusive use of that mark after the patent has expired; for instance, if he impressed on the patented articles a griffin, or some other device; but if his only trademark is a word or set of words descriptive of the patented article of which he is the only maker, it appears to me impossible for him ever to make out as a matter of fact that this mark denoted him as the maker as distinguished from other makers."
[173]
The respondent acknowledged that a monopoly context complicates the evaluation of the distinctiveness of the marks at issue. The respondent argued, however, that case law has recognized a mark may be distinctive in the context of a de facto monopoly in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Wheat
jurisprudence relied on by the applicant as a fact pattern where the owner of a patent had not registered a trademark which distinguished the source during the life of the patent. The respondent further referred me to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 553; 64 C.P.R.(2d) 1, a claim for passing off in a monopoly context, wherein the court concluded that the relevant public must know not only that the only source of the product is the owner of the mark, but also that the product, by reason of the mark, originated from a single source. I note that, once again, this was a situation in which the owner claimed a secondary meaning, a claim not made by the respondent before me.
[174]
Once again, I am not satisfied that this issue is in any way central to the disposition of this matter.
9. Conclusions With Regard To
Registrability And Distinctiveness
[175]
When tested against the relevant universe as discussed earlier in these reasons, I conclude that none of the trademarks at issue was clearly descriptive, as at the date of registration, of the wares or services in association with which it was registered. As I have stated, in order to be clearly descriptive, a trademark must be more than merely suggestive of the character or quality of the wares or services in association with which it is used or proposed to be used. The descriptive character must go to the material composition of the services or refer to an intrinsic quality of the goods or services which are the subject of the trademark. The test is the immediate first impression formed in the minds of members of the relevant universe. Thus, while in the minds of those intimately involved in the telecommunication industry such as telecommunication managers and consultants, the trademarks, or some of them, might be considered to be descriptive of the material composition of the services to which they relate or to an intrinsic quality of those services, I am not satisfied that the totality of the evidence before me, of which there was a great deal, demonstrated that as a matter of immediate or first impression, the relevant universe as a whole would have considered the descriptive character of the marks to go to the material composition of the services or to refer to an intrinsic quality of the services in question.
[176]
In reaching this conclusion, I had the greatest hesitation in respect of the trademarks CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL. My conclusion in respect of those marks was confirmed after further consideration of the quotation from the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (supra, para. [33]):
"In the technique of advertising the more complex and expensive the goods are, the greater the imaginative seeking by those producing them for attractive and arresting words; but in fixing the limits of legislative protection the courts must balance the conflicting interests and avoid placing legitimate competition at an undue disadvantage in relation to language that is common to all."
While credit or charge cards are not of themselves "... complex and expensive ... goods ...", the cards designated by the trademarks here at issue represent a service that, of itself, is complex and that provides ready access into the highly complex world of telecommunication. The respondent exercised great imagination in seeking out marks that had a well established meaning over many years that was not, of itself, descriptive of the service but that was amenable to a secondary meaning that came very close to a description of the services. In so doing, I conclude despite the able argument on behalf of the applicant, that the respondent did not appropriate terms that, in the words of the Supreme Court of Canada, placed "... legitimate competition at an undue disadvantage in relation to language that is common to all".
[177]
Nor am I convinced that, in the minds of members of the relevant universe, any of the marks at issue are the name of the service in association with which they are registered. Once again, at the relevant time, those intimately associated with the telecommunication industry might have recognized WATS as an acronym for the service to which it related, albeit not necessarily for the service for which it was registered because I am not satisfied that the two are the same, but the evidence simply does not establish that the general user-public would have formed the same opinion. INWATS and OUTWATS are clever variations on the mark WATS. If, as I have concluded, WATS itself has not been established to be the name of a service in the minds of the relevant public, I conclude that INWATS and OUTWATS, in relation to the services for which they are registered, are further from the names of those services. My comments with respect to WATS, INWATS and OUTWATS apply equally to 900 SERVICE, LE SERVICE 900 and 800 PLUS. If, as I have concluded, CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL are not descriptive of the services for which they are registered, the evidence before me establishes even less that they would be recognized by the relevant universe, in this case a broader universe, as the names of the services for which they are registered.
[178]
The evidence before me simply did not establish that any of the trademarks at issue had become generic at the date of its registration in the collective minds of the appropriate relevant universe. Thus, I conclude that none of the marks is a prohibited mark within the meaning of s. 12(1)(e) and s. 10 of the
Act
.
[179]
I reach a different conclusion on the question of whether or not the trademarks at issue were distinctive of the services of the respondent at the time of commencement of this proceeding. For whatever reason, the respondent was remarkably lax in its management and policing of its trademark rights. It may have been that the respondent and its co-members in Stentor assumed that their de facto monopoly of long distance telephone services in Canada and, for each, in its own province or region, that existed, for all intents and purposes, up to June of 1992 would continue and, of itself, would protect the respondent's trademarks rights and the mostly informal "rights" or "interests" that other Stentor members had in the marks. It might also have been assumed that unauthorized use by others in yellow pages and in other publications could only inure to the benefit of the respondent and other Stentor members in their various geographical areas. Whatever might have been the reason, I am satisfied on the evidence before me that in respect of all of the marks, unauthorized use was of such an extent by the time these proceedings were commenced as to render the trademarks not distinctive of the services of the respondent and those entitled to use the trademarks under registered user arrangements.
[180]
While all members of Stentor other than the respondent and Telesat Canada were registered as registered users of WATS and OUTWATS, the evidence before me disclosed extensive use of the two marks by entities not registered as registered users. No registered users were registered in respect of INWATS, 900 SERVICE, LE SERVICE 900 and 800 PLUS. While there was an extensive range of registered users with respect to CALLING CARD and CARTE D'APPEL, BCTel, SaskTel and Nfld Tel were not so registered.
[181]
While the argument on behalf of the respondent that its extensive range of interconnection agreements and, presumably, its arrangements with all other members of Stentor, after June 9, 1993, represented licensing arrangements that, under the legislative scheme that came into effect on that day, retroactively resulted in use by those with whom the agreements and arrangements had been entered into that inured to the benefit of the respondent, was both imaginative and well presented, I am satisfied that it cannot prevail. The evidence simply fails to show that those agreements and arrangements, if they could be construed to be licensing arrangements, provided the "... direct or indirect control of the character or quality of the ... services ..." in the hands of the respondent that the new legislative scheme required.
[182]
In the result, I conclude that none of the trademarks was distinctive at the time this proceeding was commenced, of the services of the respondent in relation to which each was registered.
10. Summary Of Conclusions
And Disposition
(a) WATS; INWATS; OUTWATS; 900
SERVICE; LE SERVICE 900;
and 800 PLUS
[183]
On the basis of the evidence before me and argument on behalf of the parties, I conclude that the registrations of the foregoing trademarks are invalid by reason of the fact that the trademarks were not distinctive at the time this proceeding was commenced of the services of the respondent in relation to which they were registered.
(b) CALLING CARD; and
CARTE D'APPEL
[184]
I conclude that the registrations of the foregoing trademarks are and always have been void and invalid by reason of the false statements in the applications for registration and the declarations of use by the original registrant, TransCanada Telephone System. If I am wrong in this, I further conclude that the registrations of the foregoing trademarks are invalid by reason of the fact that the trademarks were not distinctive at the time this proceeding was commenced of the services of the respondent in relation to which they were registered.
[185]
An order will go accordingly. The applicant is entitled to its costs.
[186]
At the time this matter came on before me, there remained outstanding an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal by the respondent from a decision of Pinard, J., in this matter, dated May 3, 1991, on an application under rule 419 of the
Federal Court Rules
. I understand that the appeal continues to be outstanding. In light of my decision, I consider the appeal to be moot. I invite counsel to consider this question and to file a notice of discontinuance of the appeal.
