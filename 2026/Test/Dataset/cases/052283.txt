Noël, J.
[orally]: I am now in a position to give a decision in court file 92-A-7171, Prince Oduro, and I will ask that my oral reasons be transcribed and once signed by me that they be filed as reasons for judgment in this matter.
[2]
This is an appeal from the decision of the refugee board holding that the applicant is not a convention refugee. The applicant is a citizen of Ghana and bases his claim on a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinions and his membership in a particular social group.
[3]
The applicant fears that if he were to return to Ghana, he will be arrested and imprisoned. He states that he is an ex-member of the Civil Defence Organization, also known as the People's Militia, which was formed by the Provisional National Defence Council when it took power.
[4]
The applicant's involvement in this organization was from 1984 to 1991. Because of some of the atrocities committed by this group, the applicant became disillusioned and dissatisfied with the militia, and in January 1989, he attempted to resign.
[5]
Fearing possible repercussions, the applicant stated that he fabricated a story of ill health in order to explain his resignation. However, his resignation was rejected by the commander. The applicant stated that he believed there would be some positive change in the situation, and as a result, he continued to work for the militia until his arrest on December 23, 1991.
[6]
The applicant testified that on that date, the commander of the Militia ordered him and others to arrest the leaders and supporters of the Movement for Freedom and Justice during a rally taking place in Sunyani.
[7]
The applicant claims that he advised the Commander of his refusal to obey the order. He then proceeded to the rally to advise the protesters of their impending arrest. The rally was interrupted by the Militia. Several persons were arrested. The applicant testified that he too was arrested at his home later on that evening.
[8]
The applicant claims that he was brought to a prison and remained there until he escaped on January 25, 1992, with the help of a former schoolmate then acting as a guard. The applicant arrived at his uncle's home and his uncle drove him to a border town where the applicant crossed over to Togo. From there, he made his way to Canada.
[9]
The Board found that the applicant's story lacked credibility. It found that it was implausible that a prison guard would make himself the applicant's accomplice given the penalty for aiding and abetting one to escape. The risk, according to the board, was too high.
[10]
The board further found that the applicant's story in regard to his flight to Togo was implausible. According to the Board, it was untenable that as he progressed towards the border, the applicant did not encounter checkpoints given that the documentary evidence indicates that police checkpoints exist country-wide, and that roadblocks and car searches are normal part of night travel in Ghana. The board also concluded that it was implausible that the applicant would not be arrested immediately upon defying the Commander's order to attend the rally in Sunyani.
[11]
This is a case that gives me substantial difficulty. The applicant's testimony was consistent throughout notwithstanding the fact that he underwent a very detailed and lengthy examination. On each of the Board's findings of implausibility, I would have been inclined to find otherwise. In particular, the applicant's testimony as to his escape appears to me to be quite plausible.
[12]
However, it is not for me to substitute my discretion for that of the board. The question I must answer is whether it was open to the board on the evidence to conclude as it did. Recognizing that if confronted with the same evidence, I would have been inclined to hold otherwise, I cannot say that the board ignored the evidence before it or acted capriciously.
[13]
It drew inferences which were adverse to the applicant's claim, and the fact that I might have seen the matter differently does not allow me to intervene in the absence of an overriding error. I have been unable to find such an error. The application is therefore dismissed. An order is signed accordingly.
Application dismissed.
