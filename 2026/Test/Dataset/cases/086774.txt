I. Introduction
[1]
Scott, J.
: This is an application by Mr. Chengze Zhou (the Applicant) for judicial review of a decision rendered by immigration officer Jaylene Hamilton (the Officer) on May 23, 2012, wherein the Officer, pursuant to paragraph 179(
b
) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 [
IRPR
], refused the Applicant's application for a temporary resident visa (the Application) on the basis that she was not satisfied he would leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay.
[2]
For the following reasons, this application for judicial review is dismissed.
II. Facts
[3]
The Applicant is a 56-year-old citizen of the People's Republic of China (PRC). On or about May 17, 2012, the Applicant applied for a temporary resident visa for the stated purpose of business exploration in Canada.
[4]
On or about May 23, 2012, the Officer considered the Application and the supporting documents submitted by the Applicant. The Officer entered the reasons for her refusal in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) and determined that the Applicant was not a genuine visitor who would leave at the end of his authorized stay.
[5]
The Officer's reasons for refusing the Applicant's Application, as entered in the GCMS, read as follows:
Applicant seeks entry for exploratory visit to Canada. Applicant has limited previous travel. Applicant has submitted limited evidence in support of his ability to invest in Canada (largely in form of unverifiable photocopied documents and poor quality computer generated print outs). Applicant has submitted limited evidence of personal establishment in PRC. Bank docs show mostly large recent lump sum deposits which appear incommensurate with stated income, evidence of funds history are [
sic
] computer generated print outs with no verifiable security features. Other docs in support of establishment are largely in the form of photocopies with no verifiable security features. I am not satisfied that the applicant is a genuine visitor to Canada who will depart Canada at the end of the period for authorized stay.
[6]
The Officer advised the Applicant that his Application was refused by letter dated May 23, 2012.
III. Legislation

IV. Issues and standard of review
A. Issues
1. Did the Officer err in refusing the Applicant's Application?
2.
Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness in failing to notify the Applicant of her concerns regarding his Application?
B. Standard of review
[8]
The standard of review for a visa officer's refusal to issue a temporary resident visa because the officer does not believe an applicant would leave Canada after his or her authorized period of stay is reasonableness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Visa officers are recognized as having expertise in assessing applications for temporary resident visas, and the Court must, therefore, show deference to their decisions on judicial review (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[9]
The question of whether the Officer should have notified the Applicant of her concerns regarding the adequacy or credibility of the documents he provided raises natural justice or procedural fairness issues. Where such issues arise, no deference is due and the Court must verify whether the requirements of procedural fairness have been followed (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
V. Parties' submissions
A. Applicant's submissions
[10]
The Applicant alleges that the Officer committed a reviewable error by failing to consider all of the evidence before her and provide adequate reasons for not issuing the visa. The Applicant notes that the fact that it was necessary for the Officer to elaborate on her reasons for refusing the visa in an affidavit is indicative of their inadequacy (see for example
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[11]
The Applicant further submits that the Officer's decision is unreasonable in light of the nature and volume of the documents filed with his visa application. The documents in question included the following: notarized copies of the business licences for Ziyun Real Estate Developments Co., Ltd. (Ziyun) and Huayang Capital Investments Co., Ltd. (Huayang); the articles of association for both of the above-mentioned companies along with the balance sheet for Ziyun, which indicates, among other things, that the value of the Applicant's share of the equity in Ziyun is at least CAD$7.31 million; a survey posted on the government of Liaoning province's website indicating that Ziyun is the number two real estate development firm in Anshan City; and a notarized copy of the Applicant's property certificate.
[12]
The Officer's conclusion that the amounts deposited as a lump sum in his bank account were incommensurate with his stated income ignores the fact, it is argued, that the Applicant's stated wage does not reflect his asset level as a high net worth business owner. Furthermore, the Officer's conclusion that the Applicant had limited travel experience was unfair, given that his passport was issued in January 2010 and he had travelled to Korea and Japan in August 2011 and made a six-country trip to Europe (with stops in Italy and Geneva) in January 2012.
[13]
In addition, the Applicant argues that he received invitations from "credible officers" in British Columbia who had themselves conducted a due diligence investigation regarding his capacity to invest in Canada and that "on this score alone, the Visa Officer should have given the Applicant the opportunity to pursue his submission that the purpose of the visit is business exploration" (Applicant's Memorandum of Argument, para 34).
[14]
Finally, the Applicant maintains that the Officer breached the duty of procedural fairness in failing to alert him of her concerns regarding his visa application. The Officer's conclusion was based on a negative credibility finding with respect to the evidence he had adduced and in such instances officers are required to provide an applicant an opportunity to respond (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). In addition, the Officer made reference to extrinsic and unknown evidence when she noted that the Applicant's documents did not bear the security features that often appear on original documents in China (e.g. serial numbers, ultraviolet security features, watermarks, etc.). She was therefore under an obligation to alert the Applicant to this concern (
see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
B. Respondent's submissions
[15]
The Respondent submits that the Officer's decision was reasonable and that the allegation that the Officer failed to provide sufficient reasons for her decision is without merit. The Respondent maintains that the GCMS Notes are intelligible and sufficiently explain why the Applicant's visa was refused. The Officer clearly indicated that the documentary evidence submitted was inadequate because it was mostly in the form of "unverifiable photocopied documents and poor quality computer generated print outs". As for the Applicant's claim regarding the Officer's affidavit, the Respondent maintains that the affidavit does not go beyond the content of the GCMS Notes or the certified record. The affidavit simply highlights the fact that the publicly available document checklist indicates that original bank statements were required, and provides slight elaboration on what the Officer meant by "verifiable security features".
[16]
Regarding the Applicant's claim that the Officer failed to analyze all of the evidence adduced, the Respondent submits that visa officers are presumed to have considered all of the evidence before them and that there is nothing to suggest the Officer failed to do so in this case.
[17]
As for the Applicant's claim that the Officer was required to alert him to her concerns with the evidence he had submitted, the Respondent cites this Court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], where it is stated that
[A]n applicant's failure to provide adequate, sufficient or credible proof with respect to his visa application does not trigger a duty to inform the applicant in order for him to submit further proof to address the finding of the officer with respect to the inadequacy, deficiency or lack of credibility. . . .
[18]
Finally, the Respondent maintains that the GCMS Notes only refer to the documents provided by the Applicant and that the document checklist stating the requirement for original documents was completed and submitted by the Applicant. The Applicant's claim that the Officer relied on external evidence in drawing her conclusions is consequently unfounded.
VI. Analysis
1. Did the Officer err in refusing the Applicant's Application?
[19]
The Applicant alleges that the Officer committed a reviewable error by failing to consider all of the evidence before her and provide adequate reasons for not issuing the visa. The Respondent insists that the Officer considered all of the evidence and provided clear and intelligible reasons for refusing issuance of the visa.
[20]
The Court agrees with the Respondent for the following reasons. Firstly, the Officer is presumed to have reviewed all of the evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (FCA)) and is not required to make reference to every document submitted (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (FCA)). Upon reading the Officer's GCMS Notes, the Court finds that she clearly considered all the evidence adduced by the Applicant. The Officer acknowledged that the Applicant had received invitations in accordance with the
Checklist for Personal or Professional Affairs (Attending an Academic Conference, Exploratory Visits, Legal Matters)
(the Checklist) (see GCMS Notes 6 and 7). The Officer also assessed documents related to the Applicant's previous travel, his income, his financial assets and his personal establishment in the PRC, and indicated that the documents failed to convince her that he could invest in Canada and would return to the PRC, thereby justifying her refusal.
[21]
As the Respondent correctly submitted, an officer's duty to provide reasons when evaluating a temporary resident visa application is minimal (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). An administrative tribunal's reasons are sufficient if they "allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes" (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In this case, the reasons clearly indicate that the Officer refused the application primarily because the Applicant failed to provide appropriate documentation.
[22]
The Applicant's most important argument is that the Officer's conclusion is unreasonable in light of the nature and volume of the documents filed with his visa application. The documents in question included the following: notarized copies of the business licences for Ziyun and Huayang; the articles of association for both of the above-mentioned companies along with the balance sheet for Ziyun, which indicates, among other things, that the value of the Applicant's share of the equity in Ziyun is at least CAD$7.31 million; a survey posted on the government of Liaoning province's website indicating that Ziyun is the number two real estate development firm in Anshan City; and a notarized copy of the Applicant's property certificate.
[23]
During the hearing, counsel for the Applicant claimed that the Officer had failed to consider all the documentation submitted because with the rejection letter he only received part of all the documentation he had presented. The Court has reviewed the certified tribunal record and must reject that argument as it is clear from the GCMS Notes that all the documentation was reviewed. It is also clear that the Officer did consider the application as one relating to an exploratory visit even though it was initially submitted as relating to company-to-company business.
[24]
The Applicant submits that the Officer's conclusion that the amounts deposited as a lump sum in his bank account are incommensurate with his stated income ignores the fact that the Applicant's stated wage does not reflect his asset level as a high net worth business owner. Furthermore, the Officer's conclusion that the Applicant had limited travel experience was unfair given that his passport was issued in January 2010 and he had travelled to Korea and Japan in August 2011 and made a six-country trip to Europe (with stops in Italy and Geneva) in January 2012.
[25]
Finally, the Applicant argues that he received invitations from "credible officers" in British Columbia who had themselves conducted a due diligence investigation regarding his capacity to invest in Canada and that "on this score alone, the Visa Officer should have given the Applicant the opportunity to pursue his submission that the purpose of the visit is business exploration" (Applicant's Memorandum of Argument, para 34).
[26]
While the Court acknowledges that the Officer's assessment of the Applicant's travel experience was unfair, the Officer's principal justification for refusing the application was the inadequacy of the documents submitted in support of the application. According to the Checklist, the Applicant was required to submit "original bank documents showing financial history over several months" and evidence of assets in China such as an "original property certificate". The Officer found the documents submitted by the Applicant inadequate because they were "largely in form of unverifiable photocopied documents and poor quality computer generated print outs". Given the Applicant's failure to fulfill the Checklist requirement to provide original documents attesting his ability to invest in Canada, the Court finds that the Officer's decision refusing to issue a temporary resident visa fell "within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
2. Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness in failing to notify the Applicant of her concerns regarding his Application?
[27]
Was the Officer required to alert the Applicant to the inadequacy of the documents he submitted?
[28]
The case law of this Court is clear in establishing that an officer is under no obligation to alert an applicant to his or her concerns regarding an application because of the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence provided. The "onus is on the Applicant to provide all relevant supporting documentation and sufficient credible evidence in support of his application" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCTD); <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 16). Furthermore, an officer need not notify an applicant of his or her concern where it "arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 24). In this case, the Officer's concerns regarding the Applicant's funds and assets arose directly from the requirements of the
IRPR
(see paragraphs 179(
b
) and (
d
)).
[29]
While it is true that a duty to notify does arise "where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 24), the Officer in this case was not questioning the credibility of the documents so much as their failure to meet the Checklist requirement that satisfactory evidence be provided. Had the Applicant filed original bank statements and had the Officer questioned their authenticity, then the duty of fairness would have required the Officer to alert the Applicant to her concerns.
[30]
The Applicant lastly alleges that the Officer introduced an extrinsic and unknown requirement when she made reference to the security features that often appear on original documents in China (e.g. serial numbers, ultraviolet security features, watermarks, etc.). The Applicant argues that in such instances an officer must afford an applicant an opportunity to respond or to provide documents with such features (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 26). The Court disagrees. The Officer made reference to the security features simply to explain why original documents are required.
[31]
In sum, this application will be denied because the Court finds that the Officer properly considered the evidence presented by the Applicant and provided adequate reasons for its rejection.
JUDGMENT
[32]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is dismissed; and
2. There is no question of general interest to certify.

[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par M. Chengze Zhou (le demandeur) à l'égard d'une décision rendue par l'agente d'immigration Jaylene Hamilton (l'agente) le 23 mai 2012, dans laquelle l'agente, en vertu de l'alinéa 179
b
) du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 [le RIPR], a rejeté la demande de visa de résident temporaire du demandeur (la demande) au motif qu'elle n'était pas convaincue qu'il quitterait le Canada à la fin de son séjour autorisé.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
II. Faits
[3]
Le demandeur est un ressortissant de 56 ans de la République populaire de Chine (RPC). Le 17 mai 2012 ou vers cette date, le demandeur a fait une demande de visa de résident permanent dans le but avoué d'explorer des possibilités de faire des affaires au Canada.
[4]
Le 23 mai 2012 ou vers cette date, l'agente a examiné la demande et les documents justificatifs présentés par le demandeur. L'agente a inscrit les motifs de son refus dans le Système mondial de gestion des cas (SMGC) et a établi que le demandeur n'était pas un visiteur authentique qui quitterait le Canada à la fin de son séjour autorisé.
[5]
Les motifs donnés par l'agente pour refuser la demande du demandeur, tel qu'inscrits dans le SMGC, sont les suivants:
[traduction]
Le demandeur demande l'entrée au Canada aux fins de visite exploratoire. Le demandeur a peu voyagé auparavant. Il a présenté des éléments de preuve limités à l'appui de sa capacité d'investir au Canada (essentiellement sous la forme de documents photocopiés invérifiables et d'imprimés d'ordinateur de mauvaise qualité). Le demandeur a produit peu d'éléments de preuve de son établissement personnel en RPC. Les documents bancaires font état essentiellement de dépôts uniques élevés récents qui semblent démesurés par rapport au revenu déclaré, les éléments de preuve relatifs à l'historique des fonds sont des imprimés d'ordinateur de mauvaise qualité sans caractéristiques de sécurité vérifiables. Les autres documents à l'appui de l'établissement sont essentiellement sous la forme de photocopies sans caractéristiques de sécurité vérifiables. Je ne suis pas convaincue que le demandeur est un visiteur authentique au Canada qui quittera le pays à la fin de son séjour autorisé.
[6]
L'agente a informé le demandeur du rejet de sa demande par lettre datée du 23 mai 2012.

IV. Questions en litige et norme de contrôle
A. Questions en litige
1. L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur en rejetant la demande du demandeur?
2.
L'agente a-t-elle manqué à l'obligation d'équité procédurale en ne faisant pas connaître au demandeur ses doutes concernant sa demande?
B. Norme de contrôle
[8]
La norme de contrôle applicable au refus d'un agent des visas de délivrer un visa de résident temporaire parce qu'il ne croit pas que le demandeur quittera le Canada à la fin de son séjour autorisé est celle de la décision raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Les agents des visas ont une spécialisation reconnue dans l'appréciation des demandes de visas de résident temporaire, et la Cour doit donc faire preuve de retenue face à leurs décisions dans les contrôles judiciaires (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[9]
La question de savoir si l'agente aurait dû informer le demandeur de ses doutes concernant le caractère suffisant ou la crédibilité des documents qu'il a fournis soulève des questions de justice naturelle et d'équité procédurale. Quand de telles questions se posent, aucune retenue n'est nécessaire, et la Cour doit vérifier si les conditions applicables à l'équité procédurale ont été respectées (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
V. Observations des parties
A. Observations du demandeur
[10]
Le demandeur soutient que l'agente a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle en ne tenant pas compte de tous les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait et ne motivant pas suffisamment sa décision de ne pas délivrer le visa. Il soutient que le fait que l'agente avait explicité ses motifs concernant le refus de délivrer un visa dans un affidavit montre que ceux-ci étaient insuffisants (voir, par exemple,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[11]
De plus, le demandeur soutient que la décision de l'agente est déraisonnable à la lumière de la nature et de la quantité de documents qu'il a produits avec sa demande de visa. Les documents en question comprenaient: des copies notariées de ses permis d'exploitation pour Ziyun Real Estate Developments Co., Ltd. (Ziyun) et Huayang Capital Investments Co., Ltd. (Huayang); les articles d'association pour ces deux entreprises et le bilan de Ziyun, qui indique notamment que la part de la valeur nette du demandeur dans Ziyun s'élève à au moins 7,31 M $CAN; un sondage affiché sur le site Web du gouvernement de la province du Liaoning selon lequel Ziyun est la deuxième entreprise de promotion immobilière à Anshan; et une copie notariée du certificat de propriété du demandeur.
[12]
Le demandeur soutient que la conclusion de l'agente voulant que les dépôts uniques dans son compte bancaire soient démesurés par rapport à son revenu déclaré ne tient pas compte du fait que le salaire déclaré du demandeur ne reflète pas son niveau d'actif à titre de propriétaire d'une entreprise à haute valeur nette. De plus, la conclusion de l'agente voulant que le demandeur ait peu voyagé était injuste, étant donné que son passeport a été délivré en janvier 2010 et qu'il est allé en Corée et au Japon en août 2011 et a visité six pays dans le cadre d'un voyage en Europe (avec arrêts en Italie et à Genève) en janvier 2012.
[13]
Qui plus est, le demandeur soutient qu'il a reçu des invitations [traduction] d'« agents crédibles » en Colombie-Britannique qui avaient eux-mêmes effectué un contrôle diligent concernant sa capacité d'investir au Canada et que [traduction] « sur ce seul aspect, l'agente des visas aurait dû donner au demandeur la possibilité de donner suite à son observation selon laquelle la visite avait pour but l'exploration de possibilités de faire des affaires » (mémoire du demandeur, au paragraphe 34).
[14]
Enfin, le demandeur soutient que l'agente a manqué à l'équité procédurale en ne lui faisant pas part de ses doutes au sujet de sa demande de visa. La conclusion de l'agente reposait sur une conclusion défavorable relative à la crédibilité en ce qui concerne la preuve qu'il avait produite et, dans de tels cas, les agents doivent donner au demandeur la possibilité de dissiper leurs doutes (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). De plus, l'agente a renvoyé à des éléments de preuve extrinsèques et inconnus lorsqu'elle a signalé que les documents fournis par le demandeur ne comportaient pas les caractéristiques de sécurité qui figurent souvent sur les documents originaux en Chine (p. ex. numéros de série, marquages visibles à l'UV, filigranes, etc.). Elle devait par conséquent informer le demandeur de ces doutes (
voir  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
B. Observations du défendeur
[15]
Le défendeur soutient que la décision de l'agente était raisonnable et que l'allégation voulant que l'agente n'avait pas suffisamment motivé sa décision n'est pas fondée. Il affirme que les notes du SMGC sont intelligibles et expliquent suffisamment pourquoi le visa a été refusé au demandeur. L'agente a clairement indiqué que les éléments de preuve documentaire produits étaient inadéquats parce qu'ils étaient essentiellement sous la forme [traduction] « de documents photocopiés invérifiables et d'imprimés d'ordinateur de mauvaise qualité ». Au sujet de l'affirmation du demandeur concernant l'affidavit de l'agente, le défendeur soutient que le document s'en tient strictement au contenu des notes du SMGC ou du dossier certifié. L'affidavit souligne simplement que, selon la liste de contrôle des documents qui est accessible au public, les demandeurs doivent produire les originaux d'états bancaires, et apporte de brèves précisions sur ce que l'agente entendait par des [traduction] « caractéristiques de sécurité vérifiables ».
[16]
Au sujet de l'affirmation du demandeur voulant que l'agente n'a pas analysé tous les éléments de preuve produits, le défendeur soutient que les agents des visas sont présumés avoir examiné toute la preuve dont ils disposent et que rien n'indique que l'agente ne l'a pas fait en l'espèce.
[17]
En ce qui concerne l'affirmation du demandeur voulant que l'agente devait lui faire part de ses doutes au sujet des éléments de preuve qu'il avait produits, le défendeur cite la décision de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] :
Lorsque la personne qui demande un visa d'immigrant omet de fournir une preuve adéquate, suffisante ou crédible, l'agent des visas n'est nullement tenu de lui demander une preuve supplémentaire susceptible d'invalider les conclusions de l'agent concernant le caractère insuffisant, inadéquat ou peu crédible de la preuve du demandeur.

Enfin, le défendeur soutient que les notes du SMGC ne renvoient qu'aux documents fournis par le demandeur et que le demandeur a rempli et signé la liste de contrôle des documents énonçant la nécessité de fournir les originaux. L'affirmation du demandeur selon laquelle l'agente s'est fondée sur des éléments de preuve extrinsèques pour tirer ses conclusions est par conséquent non fondée.
VI. Analyse
1. L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur en rejetant la demande du demandeur?
[19]
Le demandeur allègue que l'agente a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle en ne tenant pas compte de tous les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait et en ne motivant pas suffisamment son refus de délivrer le visa. Le défendeur maintient que l'agente a tenu compte de tous les éléments de preuve et a fourni des motifs clairs et intelligibles concernant le refus de délivrer le visa.
[20]
La Cour est d'accord avec le défendeur pour les motifs suivants. Premièrement, l'agente est présumée avoir examiné tous les éléments de preuve (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (CAF)) et n'est pas tenue de renvoyer à chaque document produit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (CAF)). Après avoir lu les notes du SMGC de l'agente, la Cour conclut que celle-ci a clairement pris en considération tous les éléments de preuve fournis par le demandeur. L'agente a reconnu que le demandeur avait reçu des invitations conformément à la liste de contrôle applicables aux affaires personnelles ou professionnelles (assister à une conférence, visites exploratoires, questions juridiques) (Checklist for Personal or Professional Affairs (Attending an Academic Conference, Exploratory Visits, Legal Matters)) (la liste de contrôle) (voir les notes 6 et 7 du SMGC). L'agente a également évalué les documents se rapportant aux voyages antérieurs du demandeur, à son revenu, à ses actifs financiers et à son établissement personnel dans la RPC, et a indiqué que les documents ne l'avaient pas convaincue qu'il pourrait investir au Canada et qu'il rentrerait en RPC, ce faisant justifiant son refus.
[21]
Comme le défendeur l'a soutenu à bon droit, l'obligation d'un agent de motiver sa décision dans l'évaluation d'une demande de visa de résident temporaire est minime (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Les motifs d'un tribunal administratif sont suffisants s'ils « permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables » (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En l'espèce, les motifs indiquent clairement que l'agente a rejeté la demande essentiellement parce que le demandeur n'avait pas fourni les documents voulus.
[22]
L'argument le plus important du demandeur veut que la conclusion de l'agente soit déraisonnable à la lumière de la nature et de la quantité de documents qu'il a produits avec sa demande de visa. Les documents en question comprenaient: des copies notariées de ses permis d'exploitation pour Ziyun et Huayang; les articles d'association pour les deux entreprises précitées et le bilan de Ziyun, qui indique notamment que la participation du demandeur dans Ziyun s'élève à au moins 7,31 M $CAN; un sondage affiché sur le site Web du gouvernement de la province du Liaoning selon lequel Ziyun est la deuxième entreprise de promotion immobilière à Anshan; et une copie notariée du certificat de propriété du demandeur.
[23]
Pendant l'audience, l'avocat du demandeur a affirmé que l'agente n'avait pas pris en considération tous les documents présentés parce que, avec la lettre de rejet, le demandeur n'a reçu qu'une partie de tous les documents qu'il avait fournis. La Cour a examiné le dossier certifié du tribunal et doit rejeter cet argument parce qu'il ressort clairement des notes du SMGC que tous les documents ont été examinés. Il est également clair que l'agente a examiné la demande comme si elle se rapportait à une visite exploratoire même si le demandeur l'a initialement présentée comme se rapportant à des débouchés commerciaux.
[24]
Le demandeur affirme que la conclusion de l'agente selon laquelle les dépôts uniques dans son compte bancaire sont démesurés par rapport à son revenu déclaré ne tient pas compte du fait que le salaire déclaré du demandeur ne reflète pas son niveau d'actif à titre de propriétaire d'une entreprise à haute valeur réelle. De plus, la conclusion de l'agente voulant que le demandeur ait peu voyagé est injuste étant donné que son passeport a été délivré en janvier 2010 et qu'il est allé en Corée et au Japon en août 2011 et a visité six pays dans le cadre d'un voyage en Europe (avec arrêts en Italie et à Genève) en janvier 2012.
[25]
Enfin, le demandeur soutient qu'il a reçu des invitations [traduction] « d'agents crédibles » en Colombie-Britannique qui avaient eux-mêmes effectué un contrôle diligent concernant sa capacité d'investir au Canada et que [traduction] « sur ce seul aspect, l'agente des visas aurait dû donner au demandeur la possibilité de donner suite à son observation selon laquelle la visite avait pour but l'exploration de possibilités de faire des affaires » (mémoire du demandeur, au paragraphe 34).
[26]
Bien que la Cour reconnaisse que l'évaluation par l'agente des voyages antérieurs du demandeur est injuste, la principale justification de l'agente du rejet de la demande était le caractère inadéquat des documents présentés à l'appui de la demande. Selon la liste de contrôle, le demandeur devait fournir [traduction] « des documents bancaires originaux faisant état d'antécédents financiers sur plusieurs mois » et des éléments de preuve relatifs à des actifs en Chine comme [traduction] « un certificat de propriété original ». L'agente a conclu que les documents fournis par le demandeur étaient inadéquats parce qu'ils étaient [traduction] « essentiellement sous la forme de documents photocopiés invérifiables et d'imprimés d'ordinateur de mauvaise qualité ». Étant donné le défaut du demandeur de remplir la condition énoncée sur la liste de contrôle selon laquelle il devait fournir des documents originaux attestant de sa capacité d'investir au Canada, la Cour conclut que la décision de l'agente de refuser de délivrer un visa de résident temporaire appartient « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
2. L'agente a-t-elle manqué à l'obligation d'équité procédurale en ne faisant pas connaître au demandeur ses doutes concernant sa demande?
[27]
L'agente était-elle tenue de faire savoir au demandeur que les documents qu'il avait fournis étaient insuffisants?
[28]
La jurisprudence de la Cour est claire et établit que l'agent n'est pas tenu de faire connaître au demandeur ses doutes concernant une demande à cause de l'insuffisance des éléments de preuve fournis. Il « incombe au demandeur de fournir tous les documents d'appui pertinents et de présenter suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles au soutien de sa demande » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst.); <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 16). De plus, l'agent n'est pas tenu de signaler au demandeur ses réserves lorsqu'elles « découlent directement des exigences de la loi ou d'un règlement connexe » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 24). En l'espèce, les réserves de l'agente concernant les fonds et les actifs du demandeur découlaient directement des exigences du RIPR (voir les alinéas 179
b
) et
d
)).
[29]
S'il est vrai que « lorsque l'agent des visas a des doutes sur la crédibilité, l'exactitude ou l'authenticité de renseignements fournis par le demandeur au soutien de sa demande » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 24), il a obligation de le signaler au demandeur, l'agente en l'espèce ne doutait pas tant de la crédibilité des documents que de leur défaut de respecter la condition énoncée sur la liste de contrôle consistant à fournir des éléments de preuve satisfaisants. Si le demandeur avait produit les états bancaires originaux et que l'agente doutait de leur authenticité, celle-ci aurait alors dû, par souci d'équité, faire connaître ses réserves au demandeur.
[30]
Enfin, le demandeur allègue que l'agente a introduit une condition extrinsèque et inconnue lorsqu'elle a mentionné les caractéristiques de sécurité qui figurent souvent sur les documents originaux en Chine (p. ex. numéros de série, marquages visibles à l'UV, filigranes, etc.). Le demandeur soutient que, en de tels cas, l'agent doit donner au demandeur la possibilité de dissiper ses doutes ou de produire des documents portant de telles caractéristiques (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 26). La Cour n'est pas d'accord. L'agente a mentionné les caractéristiques de sécurité simplement pour expliquer pourquoi les originaux étaient nécessaires.
[31]
En somme, la demande sera rejetée parce que la Cour estime que l'agente a dûment pris en considération les éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur et a suffisamment motivé le rejet de la demande.
