Overview
[1]
O'Reilly, J.
: In 2009, the applicant, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), dismissed Mr Joseph Wilson without cause. AECL paid Mr Wilson 6 months' severance pay. Mr Wilson complained of unjust dismissal.
[2]
A labour adjudicator appointed under the
Canada Labour Code
, RSC 1985, c L-2, s 242(1) (CLC - see Annex for provisions cited) concluded that the CLC only permits dismissals for cause. Therefore, he found that Mr Wilson's complaint of unjust dismissal was made out. The question of the appropriate remedy remained. He directed the parties to discuss an appropriate remedy, and adjourned a hearing into the issue until this application for judicial review could be heard and decided.
[3]
AECL argues that the adjudicator's decision was unreasonable because it did not accord with a proper interpretation of the CLC or the applicable jurisprudence. It asks me to quash the adjudicator's decision and declare its conclusions to be wrong.
[4]
Mr Wilson contends that the adjudicator's decision was reasonable and that I should dismiss AECL's application for judicial review. Further, he argues that this application for judicial review is premature because the adjudicator's decision on an appropriate remedy remains outstanding. Accordingly, AECL is seeking judicial review on an interlocutory decision which is strongly discouraged in the case law.
[5]
I am satisfied that the adjudicator's decision represented a final decision on the merits of Mr Wilson's complaint and, therefore, that this application for judicial review is not premature. Further, I find that the adjudicator's conclusion that the CLC only provides remedies for dismissals for cause was unreasonable. Therefore, I must allow this application for judicial review and order the adjudicator to consider the appropriate remedy.
[6]
There are two issues:
1. Is this application for judicial review premature?
2. Was the adjudicator's decision unreasonable?
II.
The Adjudicator's Decision
[7]
The adjudicator observed that there exist two streams of cases relating to dismissals without cause. One holds that the CLC provides a remedy of notice or severance pay for dismissals made without cause (ss 230 and 235). Another group of cases states that, in any case where an employee challenges his or her dismissal, the broad remedies for unjust dismissal (s 242) are available, regardless of whether the employer paid the employee severance pay.
[8]
The adjudicator decided that he need not resolve this issue because the Federal Court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] was binding on him. There, Justice John O'Keefe stated that employers cannot avoid the unjust dismissal remedies under the CLC simply by awarding severance pay. The adjudicator interpreted this ruling to mean that employees who have been dismissed without cause can seek remedies for unjust dismissal. Therefore, AECL could not lawfully dismiss Mr Wilson without just cause.
[9]
Accordingly, the adjudicator found that AECL could not avoid a determination that Mr Wilson's termination was unjust simply by pointing to the severance payment made to him. He had a valid claim that his termination was carried out without just cause, which should result in a remedy under the CLC.
III.
Issue One - is the application for judicial review premature?
[10]
Mr Wilson argues that this application for judicial review was brought prematurely. The adjudicator had not completed his task. While he had decided the question of whether Mr Wilson's dismissal was unjust - it was, the adjudicator said, because AECL had offered no cause for firing him - he left open the question of the appropriate remedy. Therefore, according to Mr Wilson, AECL should have awaited the final outcome before commencing this application.
[11]
In my view, this application is not premature.
[12]
As a general proposition, courts discourage the breaking up of proceedings into discrete parcels and encourage parties to finish their business in the tribunal below before coming to court:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[13]
However, courts have also recognized exceptions. Special circumstances can sometimes justify making an application for judicial review even though the tribunal's work has not been completed: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 33.
[14]
Here, as I see it, the adjudicator had, in effect, bifurcated the proceeding before him. He had made a final decision on the merits of Mr Wilson's complaint and left open the question of remedy. He hoped the parties might settle that issue making further proceedings unnecessary.
[15]
In this situation, I believe it was proper for AECL to pursue its application for judicial review of the adjudicator's decision that Mr Wilson had been unjustly dismissed. The adjudicator had made a final determination on the substance of the matter before him. Further, had AECL waited until the adjudicator had decided the issue of remedy, the legal question to which it sought an answer might have been moot (
eg
, if the adjudicator found that the severance payment AECL had already made to Mr Wilson amounted to just compensation). Under that scenario, AECL would likely not have been able to challenge the adjudicator's finding that the CLC only recognizes dismissals with cause.
[16]
Dealing with this application for judicial review at this point in time does not raise issues of additional costs or delay that animate the general rule against fragmentation of administrative proceedings. The adjudicator expressly held off deciding the issue of remedy while this proceeding was pending. Further, this is not a situation where the applicant should have waited to see whether it might ultimately have succeeded before the tribunal; a ruling on the merits had already been made against it.
[17]
Therefore, I am satisfied that this application for judicial review is not premature.
IV.
Issue Two - Was the adjudicator's decision unreasonable?
[18]
Mr Wilson argues that the adjudicator reasonably concluded that he was bound by the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision.
[19]
I disagree. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> does not stand for the proposition for which the adjudicator cited it - that is, that the CLC only permits dismissals for cause.
[20]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the employer had dismissed an employee based on its belief that he had reached retirement age under provincial law. The employer also had some concerns about the employee's ability to continue in the position.
[21]
The employee complained on the basis that his employment was governed by the CLC, not provincial law. Further, he argued that the employer had not proved that he was unable to perform the job.
[22]
The adjudicator agreed that the CLC applied to the employer. Further, she concluded that the employer had not shown just cause for dismissing its employee and awarded damages of $5,500 for unjust dismissal.
[23]
On judicial review, the employer argued that the adjudicator erred by ordering it to pay compensation for unjust dismissal since it did not have an obligation to pay severance. At the time, the CLC provided that an employer who dismissed a person who was entitled to a pension was deemed not to have terminated that person's employment (s 235(2)(
b
) - now repealed). Therefore, that person was not entitled to severance pay.
[24]
Justice O'Keefe concluded that the adjudicator's award of compensation was not severance pay. It was compensation for unjust dismissal. He also deferred to the adjudicator's factual finding that the employer had not shown just cause for dismissing its employee. In turn, the award of damages was not unreasonable. Justice O'Keefe found that, although the employer did not have to pay severance under the CLC, it did have to pay compensation for unjust dismissal. In that context, he stated that the employer could not "avoid the operation of the unjust dismissal provisions by resorting to the severance payment provisions" (at para 39).
[25]
Justice O'Keefe did not state that the CLC only recognizes dismissals for cause. His general statement that making a severance payment is not a defence against an award of damages for unjust dismissal is uncontroversial. This simply means that where an adjudicator concludes that the employer's reason for dismissing an employee does not stand up, the employee may be entitled to compensation in an amount greater than any severance payment the employer may have made. However, it does not follow from that statement that employers governed by the CLC cannot dismiss employees without cause. Justice O'Keefe simply did not, and did not have to, deal with that issue on the facts before him. No severance payment had been made by the employer, so there was no basis for any suggestion that the employer had evaded payment of compensation for unjust dismissal by having made a severance award. The fact that the employee was not entitled to severance did not mean that he could not obtain compensation for unjust dismissal.
[26]
Accordingly, the adjudicator here unreasonably relied on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> for the proposition that employers governed by the CLC must show just cause for all dismissals. The adjudicator also cited two arbitration decisions in support of his conclusion that the CLC only recognizes dismissals for just cause. But those cases do not stand for that proposition either.
[27]
In the first (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]), the complainant contended that he had been unjustly dismissed when his three-year contract was terminated after two years, even though his employer had agreed to pay the severance pay owed to him under the contract. Before the adjudicator, the employer attempted to withdraw its initial contention that it had just cause to terminate the complainant. The adjudicator found that neither the termination of the contract with severance pay, nor the employer's withdrawal of its allegation of cause, prevented consideration as to whether the employee's dismissal was unjust. The adjudicator stated that "payment of the minimum severance required under the
Code
does not automatically exclude a determination that a dismissal is unjust for the purposes of Division XIV, even where an employee has agreed to such an arrangement in his contract of employment" (at para 33). Simply put, where the employer alleged that it had cause to dismiss the employee, the adjudicator found that the payment of severance does not necessarily prevent an inquiry into whether the employee had been unjustly dismissed. He did not state that the CLC only permits dismissals for cause.
[28]
In the second case (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]), the complainant argued that he had been unjustly dismissed when his employer concluded that he had failed to observe company policies and practices. The employer paid him about one month's wages as severance pay. Before the adjudicator, the employer attempted to argue that the dismissal was actually without cause and, therefore, that the complainant was only entitled to severance pay, not compensation or any other supplementary remedy. The adjudicator concluded that the employer could not resile from its initial suggestion that the complainant was dismissed for cause. The question, therefore, was whether the employer's reason for terminating the complainant was just. The adjudicator found that the employer's reason was not supported by the evidence and, therefore, did not amount to just cause. It ordered payment of an additional month's wages as compensation. The adjudicator noted that "the expression 'unjust dismissal' bypasses the entitlement of an employer to terminate an employee at any time without cause provided the employee is compensated by way of severance pay or damages in lieu of notice" (at para 42). Out of context, that statement sounds supportive of the adjudicator's position in Mr Wilson's case. However, the adjudicator went on to explain that the question of the justness of the complainant's dismissal must be analyzed even though the employer had paid him severance pay. Again, as in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the adjudicator was simply noting that the payment of severance does not prevent consideration of the justness of an employee's dismissal in cases where it is in issue. He did not state that there can be no dismissal without cause under the CLC.
[29]
Neither of these cases supports the proposition that the CLC only recognizes dismissals for cause. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> tells us that payment of severance does not preclude an inquiry into whether the employee was unjustly dismissed. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> holds that an employer who purports to dismiss an employee for cause cannot avoid paying compensation when the evidence does not show that the dismissal was just, even though the employee had been given severance pay.
[30]
Accordingly, I see no evidence of the two divergent camps to which the adjudicator referred in his decision. Neither of the arbitral decisions he cited for the proposition that the CLC only permits dismissals for cause actually says that.
[31]
I also note that the only arbitration decision cited by Justice O'Keefe in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was also cited in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There, the employer attempted to characterize the complainant's dismissal as being without cause, yet identified a number of reasons for its decision to terminate the complainant's employment. The adjudicator distinguished between economic and administrative dismissals, on the one hand, and those based on alleged cause. He found that employers could not, in effect, contract out of the provisions of the CLC that provide remedies for unjust dismissal, or simply avoid them by providing severance pay. In the result, the adjudicator found that the employer's reasons for dismissing the complainant were insufficient and, therefore, unjust. Again, the decision does not stand for the proposition that employers governed by the CLC can only dismiss employees for just cause.
[32]
Mr Wilson also relied heavily on Justice Marc Nadon's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCTD) (QL), in support of his contention that the CLC only permits dismissals for just cause. I would first note that Justice Nadon's discussion of this issue was purely obiter. He concluded that the application for judicial review before him was made out of time (at paras 11-12). However, he undertook to make a "few brief remarks" on the merits on the case. In the passage relied on by Mr Wilson, Justice Nadon observed that a person who has been unjustly dismissed must be compensated with more than mere severance pay. Such a person has suffered a wrong and should be "compensated for having been mistreated" (at para 47).
[33]
Justice Nadon's remarks were made under the heading "Quantum". He was discussing the question of the appropriate damages for someone who had been wrongly dismissed for cause. He was merely pointing out that compensation beyond severance pay would be an appropriate remedy in that situation. He specifically distinguished between administrative dismissals, where severance pay was the appropriate remedy, and other forms of unjust dismissal, where further compensation would be required. Nowhere does he state that the CLC only permits dismissals for cause.
[34]
Therefore, as I see it, the CLC sets out the following regime for dismissals.
[35]
An employer can dismiss an employee without cause so long as it gives notice or severance pay (ss 230, 235). If an employee believes that the terms of his or her dismissal were unjust, he or she can complain (s 240). The only exceptions to the general right to make a complaint are where the dismissal resulted from a lay-off for lack of work or a discontinuance of the employee's position, or the employee has some other statutory remedy (s 242(3.1)).
[36]
In addition, an employee can complain if he or she believes that the reason given by the employer for the dismissal was unjustified or if the dismissal is otherwise unjust (
eg
, based on discrimination or reprisal) (s 240(1)). If the adjudicator appointed to entertain the complaint concludes on any basis that the dismissal was unjust, he or she has broad remedial powers to compensate the employee, reinstate the employee, or grant any other suitable remedy (s 242(4)).
[37]
The fact that an employer has paid an employee severance pay does not preclude an adjudicator from granting further relief where the adjudicator concludes that the dismissal was unjust. Similarly, there is no basis for concluding that the CLC only permits dismissals for cause. That conclusion would fail to take account of the clear remedies provided in ss 230 and 235 (
ie
, notice and severance) for persons dismissed without cause.
[38]
My construction of the CLC is supported by the following arbitral decisions:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> upheld on other grounds in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[39]
I also note that if Parliament's intention had been to create in Part III of the CLC a regime under which employers could only dismiss employees for cause, it obviously would not have included ss 230 and 235. Further, a desire to create such a regime could easily have been expressed, as it is in the
Financial Administration Act
, RSC 1985, c F-11, s 12(3), and the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
, SC 2000, c 17, s 49(3)(
b
).
[40]
Accordingly, I must conclude that the adjudicator's decision was unreasonable. Under the circumstances, it is unnecessary to order a new hearing before a different adjudicator. Since the issue of remedy is still outstanding, it simply remains for the adjudicator to decide whether the terms of Mr Wilson's dismissal were just.
[41]
Accordingly, I would remit this matter to the adjudicator for a decision on the appropriate remedy.
IV.
Conclusion and Disposition
[42]
This application was not brought prematurely because the adjudicator had arrived at a final decision on the merits of Mr Wilson's complaint. However, I find that the adjudicator unreasonably decided that he was bound by the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision to conclude that the CLC only permits dismissals for cause. That case simply does not stand for that broad proposition.
[43]
Accordingly, I must allow this application. I would refer the matter back to the adjudicator to determine whether the terms of Mr Wilson's severance were unjust. However, I make no order for costs against Mr Wilson because this application permitted the resolution of an important legal issue applicable well beyond the dispute between the parties.
JUDGMENT
[44]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is allowed;
2. The matter is returned to the adjudicator to determine an appropriate remedy; and
3. There is no order as to costs.
Application allowed.
