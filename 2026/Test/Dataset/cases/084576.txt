[1]
O'Keefe, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision by an immigration officer (the officer) of the High Commission of Canada in Nairobi, Kenya dated April 11, 2012, wherein the applicant's permanent residence application was refused. The officer's decision was based on the finding that the applicant and her spouse and daughters did not meet the requirements to be members of the Convention refugee abroad class or members of the humanitarian protected persons abroad designated class.
[2]
The applicant requests that the officer's decision be set aside and the application be referred for redetermination by a different immigration officer.
Background
[3]
The applicant and her family are originally from Ethiopia. The applicant was married once before her current marriage. Her former spouse is the father of her two daughters. The applicant married her current spouse in 2010.
[4]
The applicant states that she fled Ethiopia because of her ex-husband's political involvement. The ex-husband was allegedly wanted by police due to his Oromo ethnicity and his support for the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). The applicant claims that in 1999, she was detained by police for one month because they could not find her (former) husband and that during that time, she was physically and sexually abused. Once released, the applicant was required to sign in with the police daily for two weeks, following which she and her children fled Ethiopia for Djibouti on foot.
[5]
The applicant's current husband states that in a 2004 election, he voted in support of the OKKO (the Oromo Congress Party). However, the victory was denied by the Ethiopian government and a group of students including the applicant's spouse, were detained. They were held for 15 days and then released with a warning. He left for Djibouti following his release.
[6]
The applicant applied from Djibouti to be admitted to Canada as a Convention refugee along with her current husband and her daughters. The applicant and her husband were interviewed on March 21, 2012, at which time the applicant gave contradictory evidence about her ex-husband. The applicant first stated that he was detained in 1999 in Ethiopia, disappeared after his release and that she did not know if he was dead or alive. The applicant then stated that he reappeared in Djibouti and that they divorced in 2005 because he was abusive and taking khat. When asked by the officer about this discrepancy, the applicant gave no response and then when asked if she would be able to get his consent for their two daughters to travel to Canada, she answered that he had disappeared from Djibouti after their divorce.
[7]
The applicant also submitted an Attestation from ONARS (the Office National D'Assistance Aux Réfugiés et Sinistrés) issued in 2003 and her husband's 2004 ONARS Attestation Provisoire which verified their refugee status. The officer expressed concern about the authenticity of the Attestations and asked if he could verify the documents with ONARS. The applicant and her spouse agreed and on March 28, 2012, the officer made an entry into the CAIPS notes stating"Verification conducted: ONARS confirmed that the Attestations of PA and spouse were not genuine." The officer's decision to deny the application was rendered the same day and the decision was communicated to the applicant by letter on April 11, 2012.
Officer's Decision
[8]
In the April 11, 2012 letter, the officer stated that the applicant had provided vague and limited information about her ex-husband's political involvement, which was her alleged reason for fearing persecution in Ethiopia. He further noted that the Attestations filed in support of the application were not genuine. As a result, he was not satisfied that the applicant's evidence was credible. The officer stated that the applicant had been given an opportunity to respond to his concerns and that he had considered the response, but that his decision remained unchanged. He therefore concluded that the applicant and her family did not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
[9]
In the March 28, 2012 CAIPS notes, the officer stated that the applicant gave vague answers about her ex-husband's involvement with the OLF and that she"could not say why she though [
sic
] he [her ex-husband] was an OLF member except from his ethnicity". The officer further noted the contradictory evidence that the applicant gave about her ex-husband, as well as the evidence that he had abused her. He concluded that because she was remarried and is no longer in contact with her ex-husband, she did not appear to be a "woman at risk."
[10]
The officer went on to note his concerns with the authenticity of the ONARS Attestations that had been submitted, and the fact that his "concerns were confirmed by the issuing authority of [those] kinds of documents."
[11]
With regard to the applicant's contradictory evidence about her ex-husband, the officer explained that it was possible that the applicant had meant that she did not know if her ex-husband was alive after he disappeared for the second time in Djibouti and gave her the benefit of the doubt for those inconsistencies.
[12]
Nonetheless, the officer's other concerns remained and he concluded that given the vagueness of her answers regarding the reason that she feared persecution and the fraudulent documents submitted in support of the applicant's status in Djibouti and the time of her arrival there, there were strong credibility concerns about the central elements of the claim. The officer was thus not satisfied that the applicant's fear of persecution due to alleged political opinions was well-founded.
[13]
The applicant's daughters' claims were the same as their mother's and thus failed for the same reasons. The applicant's spouse's claim was also not found to be credible and based on the information that he provided about his detention in Ethiopia and in light of the conditions there, the officer was not satisfied that the spouse's fear of persecution due to alleged political opinions was well-founded.
Issues
[14]
The applicant submits the following points at issue:
1. What is the appropriate standard of review?
2. Did the officer act unreasonably in failing to consider the Gender Guidelines when assessing the applicant's credibility?
3. Was the duty of fairness breached by non-disclosure of extrinsic evidence and the absence of an opportunity to respond?
Applicant's Written Submissions
[15]
The applicant submits that the officer failed to consider or apply the Gender Guidelines and in particular, the Guideline that women from cultures where men do not share the details of their activities with their female relatives may not be able to explain the experiences of their male relatives. The officer acted unreasonably in not having regard to the Gender Guidelines and the cultural context in which the applicant found herself. As a result, the credibility finding made by the officer, based in part on the lack of the applicant's knowledge of her ex-husband's political activities, was perverse.
[16]
The applicant further submits that, according to the CAIPS notes, somewhere between the March 21, 2012 interview and the March 28, 2012 post-interview observations recorded in the CAIPS notes, the officer received a communication from ONARS about the applicant. However, that communication was never provided to the applicant, nor was she given an opportunity to respond.
[17]
The officer gave no consideration to the question of where and how the applicant got the Attestations; if the applicant got the documents from ONARS, then she cannot be faulted for them not being properly issued. Furthermore, the officer stated that the applicant was given the opportunity to respond to his concerns, but that did not happen, as the applicant learned that ONARS had confirmed the officer's concerns when she received a copy of the certified tribunal record. Finally, there is only reference to the communication with ONARS in the CAIPS notes, but the applicant still does not know what the nature of that communication was. The applicant submits that in light of the fact that in both the refusal letter and the Immigration Manual, the respondent allows for an applicant's opportunity to respond, there is a legitimate expectation that this procedure would be followed.
[18]
The applicant submits that, provided she was found credible, there are compelling reasons arising out of past persecution; her sexual assault during detention in particular, that should allow her to be found a Convention refugee.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[19]
The respondent submits that the applicant is asking the Court for a reassessment of the evidence, which is not the proper function of the Court in a judicial review.
[20]
The respondent submits that none of the applicant's claims were based on a fear of persecution because of her gender; rather they were based on her ex-husband's alleged association with a political group. Therefore, there was no requirement to apply the Guidelines. The applicant was asked about the nature of her ex-husband's political involvement, which was the alleged reason that she left Ethiopia and stated that she knew he supported the OLF because he was Oromo. The respondent also notes that the applicant was asked during the interview whether any of her family members had been involved as a member or supporter of a political party or religious group and she responded in the negative. The officer's assessment of the applicant's credibility was therefore reasonable.
[21]
With regard to the alleged breach of procedural fairness, the respondent submits that the officer expressed concerns about the Attestations at the outset of the interview and that he asked if he could have the documents verified with ONARS. There is no indication in the CAIPS notes that the applicant or her spouse gave any response to the officer's concerns and there was no ambiguity in the CAIPS notes as to what the officer was concerned about. Contrary to the applicant's submissions, she and her spouse were aware during the interview process that the validity of the Attestations was in question. The officer gave them ample opportunity to provide an explanation and participate in a meaningful manner in determining their claims by making them aware of this concern at the beginning of the interview. There has therefore been no breach of procedural fairness.
Applicant's Reply
[22]
The applicant submits that the Gender Guidelines have four components, the first two dealing with substantive grounds of prosecution, the second two dealing with evidence and procedure. The respondent is effectively taking the position that the Guidelines dealing with evidence and procedure can reasonably be ignored and that the only part of the Guidelines that must be considered is the substantive grounds or persecution. However, the applicant argues, there is nothing in the jurisprudence to justify this division and the respondent's proposition is artificial.
[23]
The applicant accepts that the Guidelines do not need to be mentioned if they are followed in substance, but where, as here, there is a departure from the Guidelines, there is a legal duty to explain why they are not being followed. The applicant notes
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ No 462, which she states stands for the proposition that the necessity of taking into account cultural considerations when assessing the credibility of a female applicant is not limited to gender-based claims.
[24]
The applicant submits that the duty of disclosure of extrinsic evidence with an opportunity to respond is not limited to extrinsic evidence about which no notice has been given that it would be sought. The mere fact that the applicant was told that her documents would be verified does not tell her what the result of the verification would be. It is impossible for the applicant to respond to the results of the verification simply because she knew there was verification and the ability for her to respond to a third party document she had to actually see the document or at least have a meaningful summary of its contents. The mere fact of knowing that such a document will come into existence is not sufficient to give the applicant a meaningful opportunity to respond.
Analysis and Decision
Issue 1
What is the appropriate standard of review?
[25]
Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[26]
This Court has reviewed the failure to consider the Gender Guidelines on a reasonableness standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1050; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 18, [2010] FCJ No 295). In reviewing the officer's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47 and
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraphs 59 and 61).
[27]
It is trite law that the appropriate standard of review for issues of procedural fairness is correctness (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 43). No deference is owed to decision makers on these issues (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 50).
[28]
I wish to now deal with Issue 3.
Issue 3
Was the duty of fairness breached by non-disclosure of extrinsic evidence and the absence of an opportunity to respond?
[29]
The case law from this Court teaches that generally, where an officer has extrinsic information of which the applicant is unaware, the applicant should be given the opportunity to disabuse the officer of any concerns arising from that evidence (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 203; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 25, [2010] FCJ No 624). Extrinsic evidence which was not put to an applicant and was found to have violated an applicant's right to procedural fairness has included fraudulent client contracts (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] FCJ No 65), evidence that was supplied by a senior manager at an applicant's former place of employment (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). These were all cases in which the extrinsic evidence considered was central to the officers' decisions and the applicants were not given the chance to address it. Conversely, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1037, the officer's reliance on evidence that a particular accounting firm had produced the applicant's financial statements was not found to breach procedural fairness because the officer did not rely on it in his final decision.
[30]
In the current case, the applicant and her spouse were given notice during the interview of the concerns that the officer had about the authenticity of the ONARS Attestations. Specifically, in the March 21, 2012 CAIPS notes, the officer recorded that he "expressed concerns regarding the documents and asked PA and spouse if [he] could have the documents verified with ONARS and they said yes" and later on that he "had expressed [his] concerns about the authenticity of the documents submitted at the beginning of the interview."
[31]
Later, in the CAIPS notes recorded on March 28, 2012 the officer stated "verification conducted: ONARS confirmed that the Attestations of PA and spouse were not genuine" and that he "expressed concerns about the document and [his] concerns were confirmed by the issuing authority of these kinds of documents." The alleged inauthenticity of the Attestations then formed part of the officer's reasons for denying the applicant's claim.
[32]
The respondent argues that the officer made the applicant and her spouse aware of his concerns at the outset of the interview on March 21, 2012, giving them ample opportunity to provide an explanation and participate in a meaningful manner in determining their claim. While this is true, it is also not the point. The real issue is the fact that the officer then allegedly received evidence from ONARS that was used in part to deny the applicant's claim, which the applicant has not had an opportunity to respond to. Indeed, it is unclear from the record what kind of communication the officer had from ONARS and how ONARS was able to confirm that the Attestations were not valid. The entries in the CAIPS notes which make it impossible to discern what case the applicant had to make (particularly given that she was not even made aware of this new evidence) and for this Court to fully assess the reasonableness of the decision. Pursuant to the jurisprudence noted above, the officer breached procedural fairness and the decision should be returned for redetermination by a different officer.
[33]
Because of my finding on Issue 3, I need not deal with Issue 2.
[34]
The applicant submitted the following two proposed questions of general important for my consideration for certification:
1. Is the legal duty to consider the Gender Guidelines in appropriate cases limited, in vas office applications for membership in the Convention refugee abroad class or a member of the humanitarian protected persons abroad designated class, to cases where the application is based on fear of persecution because of gender?
2. In a visa office application for membership in the Convention refugee abroad class or a member of the humanitarian protected persons abroad designated class, when the visa office considers extrinsic evidence, is the duty of fairness respected by disclosure of the intent to seek extrinsic evidence and the potential source without disclosure of the extrinsic evidence obtained with an opportunity to respond?
[35]
The respondent did not wish to submit a proposed question but opposed the certification of the questions proposed by the applicant.
[36]
I am not prepared to certify either question as they do not contemplate issues of broad significance or general application (see
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), 91994] FCJ No 1637 at paragraph 4).
[37]
The judicial review is allowed.
JUDGMENT
[38]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the officer is set aside and the matter is referred to a different officer for redetermination.

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire fondée sur le paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), visant la décision, en date du 11 avril 2012, d'un agent de l'immigration (l'agent) du Haut-commissariat du Canada à Nairobi (Kenya), rejetant la demande de résidence permanente présentée par la demanderesse. L'agent en a décidé ainsi après avoir conclu que la demanderesse, son époux et ses filles ne répondent pas aux conditions d'appartenance à la catégorie des réfugiés au sens de la Convention outre-frontières ou à celle des personnes protégées à titre humanitaire outre-frontières.
[2]
La demanderesse sollicite l'annulation de la décision et le renvoi de sa demande à un autre agent de l'immigration pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision.
Contexte
[3]
La demanderesse et sa famille sont originaires d'Éthiopie. Son actuel conjoint est son second mari. Le père de ses deux filles est son ancien mari. La demanderesse a épousé celui qui est aujourd'hui son mari en 2010.
[4]
La demanderesse affirme s'être enfuie d'Éthiopie en raison des activités politiques de son ancien mari. Il semblerait que celui-ci ait été recherché par la police en raison de son appartenance au peuple Oromo et de son soutien au Front de libération Oromo (OLF). La demanderesse affirme qu'en 1999, la police, qui ne parvenait pas à retrouver son (ancien) mari, l'a détenue pendant un mois et qu'au cours de cette période de détention, elle a fait l'objet de sévices physiques et sexuels. Après sa remise en liberté, elle a été obligée, pendant deux semaines, de se présenter chaque jour à la police. C'est après cela, qu'avec ses enfants, elle s'est enfuie d'Éthiopie, se rendant à pied jusqu'à Djibouti.
[5]
L'actuel mari de la demanderesse affirme avoir, lors de l'élection de 2004, voté pour l'OKKO (Congrès national Oromo). La victoire du parti a, cependant, été refusée par le gouvernement éthiopien qui a arrêté un groupe d'étudiants, y compris le mari de la demanderesse. Ils ont été détenus pendant 15 jours, puis relâchés avec un avertissement. Une fois remis en liberté, son mari est parti pour Djibouti.
[6]
À Djibouti, la demanderesse a demandé à être, avec son mari et ses filles, admis au Canada comme réfugiés au sens de la Convention. La demanderesse et son mari ont été interrogés le 21 mars 2012, et, à cette occasion, la demanderesse a fait des déclarations contradictoires au sujet de son ancien mari. Elle a d'abord affirmé qu'il avait été détenu en Éthiopie en 1999, qu'il avait disparu après sa remise en liberté et qu'elle ne savait pas s'il était encore en vie. Elle a, après cela, dit qu'il avait refait surface à Djibouti et qu'ils avaient divorcé en 2005, car il la maltraitait et s'adonnait au khat. Interrogée au sujet de cette contradiction, la demanderesse ne répondit pas et lorsqu'on lui demanda s'il lui était possible d'obtenir de son ancien mari qu'il consente à ce que leurs deux filles se rendent au Canada, elle répondit qu'il avait, après leur divorce, disparu de Djibouti.
[7]
La demanderesse a également produit une attestation de l'ONARS (l'Office national d'assistance aux réfugiés et sinistrés) datée de 2003, ainsi qu'une attestation provisoire de l'ONARS, datée de 2004, les deux documents confirmant le statut de réfugié d'elle et de son mari. L'agent, incertain quant à l'authenticité de ces attestations, leur demanda s'il pouvait les vérifier auprès de l'ONARS. La demanderesse et son époux acceptèrent et, le 28 mars 2012, l'agent ajouta aux notes du STIDI, la mention [traduction] « Vérification effectuée: l'ONARS confirme que les attestations concernant la demanderesse principale et son époux ne sont pas authentiques. » L'agent a, le même jour, décidé de rejeter la demande d'asile, la décision étant transmise à la demanderesse par lettre en date du 11 avril 2012.
Décision de l'agent
[8]
Dans sa lettre du 11 avril 2012, l'agent expliquait à la demanderesse que les renseignements qu'elle avait fournis sur les activités politiques de son ancien mari étaient minces et vagues, alors que ce sont ces activités politiques qu'elle invoquait comme motif de sa crainte d'être persécutée en Éthiopie. Il ajoutait que les attestations produites à l'appui de sa demande n'étaient pas authentiques. Il n'était, par conséquent, pas convaincu que le témoignage de la demanderesse était digne de foi. L'agent précisait également à la demanderesse qu'il lui avait fourni l'occasion de réagir aux préoccupations qu'il éprouvait, qu'il avait pris en compte la réponse qu'elle lui avait donnée, mais qu'il maintenait sa décision. Il a donc conclu que la demanderesse et sa famille ne craignaient pas avec raison d'être persécutées du fait de leur race, de leur religion, de leur nationalité, de leur appartenance à un groupe social ou de leurs opinions politiques.
[9]
Dans les notes consignées le 28 mars 2012 au STIDI, l'agent indiquait que la demanderesse avait répondu de manière vague aux questions concernant l'action de son ancien mari au sein de l'OLF, et qu'elle [traduction] « n'était pas en mesure de dire pourquoi elle pensait qu[e] [son ancien mari] était membre de l'OLF, si ce n'est en raison de son origine ethnique ». L'agent fit également état des déclarations contradictoires de la demanderesse au sujet de son ancien mari, et de ce qu'elle avait dit de la maltraitance dont elle avait fait l'objet de sa part. Il a conclu que, dans la mesure où elle s'était remariée et qu'elle n'entretenait plus de contact avec son ancien mari, elle ne semblait pas être une « femme en péril ».
[10]
L'agent fit ensuite part de ses doutes concernant l'authenticité des attestations de l'ONARS qui lui avaient été présentées, précisant que ses [traduction] « doutes avaient été confirmés par l'autorité compétente pour délivrer ce type de documents ».
[11]
En ce qui concerne les déclarations contradictoires de la demanderesse au sujet de son ancien mari, l'agent expliqua que la demanderesse avait peut-être voulu dire qu'elle ne savait pas si son ancien mari était toujours en vie après qu'il eut disparu pour la deuxième fois à Djibouti. En ce qui concerne ces contradictions, il accorda à la demanderesse le bénéfice du doute.
[12]
Les autres préoccupations qu'éprouvait l'agent subsistèrent cependant et il conclut que, compte tenu de la manière vague dont la demanderesse avait répondu quant au motif de sa crainte d'être persécutée, et compte tenu des faux documents produits quant au statut de la demanderesse à Djibouti, et à la date de son arrivée là-bas, les principaux éléments de sa demande inspiraient de forts doutes quant à leur crédibilité. L'agent n'était donc pas convaincu du bien-fondé de sa crainte d'être persécutée en raison de ses opinions politiques prétendues.
[13]
Les demandes concernant les filles de la demanderesse, ayant le même fondement que celle de la mère, ont été rejetées pour les mêmes motifs. La demande présentée par le mari de la demanderesse n'a, elle non plus, pas été jugée crédible et, compte tenu des renseignements qu'il a fournis au sujet de sa détention en Éthiopie, et compte tenu des conditions ayant cours dans ce pays, l'agent n'était pas convaincu du bien-fondé de sa crainte d'être persécuté en raison de ses opinions politiques prétendues.
Questions en litige
[14]
Selon la demanderesse, la présente affaire soulève les questions suivantes:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable en l'espèce?
2. Était-il, de la part de l'agent, déraisonnable de ne pas tenir compte, dans son évaluation de la crédibilité de la demanderesse, des Directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe?
3. La non-divulgation d'éléments de preuve extrinsèques, et le fait de ne pas avoir donné la possibilité d'y répondre, ont-ils entraîné un manquement à l'obligation d'équité?
Observations écrites de la demanderesse
[15]
Selon la demanderesse, l'agent n'a ni pris en compte, ni appliqué les Directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe, et en particulier la directive concernant les femmes provenant de cultures où les hommes ne parlent pas de leurs activités à leurs parents de sexe féminin, ce qui fait qu'elles ne sont pas à même d'expliquer les expériences de leurs parents de sexe masculin. Il aurait donc été, de la part de l'agent, déraisonnable de ne pas tenir compte des Directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe, et du contexte culturel dans lequel se situe la demanderesse. La conclusion à laquelle l'agent a abouti relativement à la crédibilité, en partie fondée sur le fait que la demanderesse n'était pas au courant des activités politiques de son ancien mari, était par conséquent abusive.
[16]
La demanderesse fait par ailleurs valoir que, selon les notes du STIDI, entre l'entrevue du 21 mars 2012, et les observations consécutives à l'entrevue ajoutées à ces notes le 28 mars 2012, l'agent a reçu, au sujet de la demanderesse, une communication de l'ONARS. Cette communication n'a cependant pas été transmise à la demanderesse, et elle n'a pas eu la possibilité d'y répondre.
[17]
L'agent n'a pas cherché à savoir où et comment la demanderesse avait obtenu les attestations en question. Si la demanderesse s'est procuré ces documents auprès de l'ONARS, on ne saurait lui reprocher le fait qu'ils n'aient pas été délivrés en bonne et due forme. L'agent a par ailleurs indiqué que la demanderesse avait eu la possibilité de répondre aux préoccupations qu'il éprouvait, mais cela n'a pas été le cas, car la demanderesse n'a appris que l'ONARS avait confirmé les doutes éprouvés par l'agent que lorsqu'elle a reçu le dossier certifié du tribunal. Et enfin, les notes du STIDI font allusion à la communication avec l'ONARS, mais la demanderesse ne connaît toujours pas la teneur de cette communication. Selon la demanderesse, le défendeur prévoit, tant dans sa lettre de refus que dans le Guide de l'immigration, qu'un demandeur a la possibilité de répondre, et il est donc légitime de s'attendre au respect de cette procédure.
[18]
Selon la demanderesse, à condition qu'on la trouve crédible, il existe, compte tenu des persécutions qu'elle a subies par le passé, et notamment de l'agression sexuelle dont elle a fait l'objet pendant sa période de détention, de fortes raisons de lui reconnaître le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention.
Observations écrites du défendeur
[19]
Le défendeur fait valoir que ce que la demanderesse sollicite de la Cour, c'est une réévaluation de la preuve, fonction qu'il n'appartient pas à la Cour d'exercer dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire.
[20]
Selon le défendeur, aucune des demandes d'asile présentées par la demanderesse n'est fondée sur la crainte d'être persécutée en raison de son sexe; ces demandes reposent, plutôt, sur l'affiliation alléguée de son ancien mari à un certain groupe politique. En l'occurrence, il n'y avait, par conséquent, aucune obligation d'appliquer les Directives. La demanderesse a été interrogée au sujet des activités politiques de son ancien mari, car c'était, selon elle, pour cela qu'elle avait quitté l'Éthiopie, et la demanderesse a répondu savoir qu'il était partisan de l'OLF puisqu'il appartenait au peuple Oromo. Le défendeur relève en outre que, lorsqu'on lui a demandé, au cours de l'entrevue, si des gens de sa famille étaient membres ou partisans d'un parti politique ou d'un groupe religieux, la demanderesse a répondu que non. Il était donc, de la part de l'agent, raisonnable d'évaluer comme il l'a fait la crédibilité de la demanderesse.
[21]
En ce qui concerne la question du manquement prétendu à l'équité procédurale, le défendeur rappelle que l'agent a, dès le début de l'entrevue, exprimé les doutes que lui inspiraient les attestations, et demandé s'il pouvait vérifier ces documents auprès de l'ONARS. Il n'y a rien dans les notes du STIDI qui indique que la demanderesse ou son mari ait répondu aux doutes exprimés par l'agent, et les notes en question ne contiennent aucune ambiguïté quant à l'objet des doutes éprouvés par l'agent. Contrairement à ce que prétend la demanderesse dans ses observations, son mari et elle savaient, lors de l'entrevue, que la validité des attestations était en doute. L'agent leur a largement donné la possibilité de s'expliquer et de participer pleinement à l'examen de leurs demandes en leur exprimant, dès le début de l'entrevue, les doutes qu'il éprouvait. Il n'y a eu, par conséquent, aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale.
Réponse de la demanderesse
[22]
Selon la demanderesse, les Directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe comportent quatre volets, les deux premiers concernant les motifs de persécution invoqués, les deux autres concernant la preuve et la procédure. Le défendeur affirme, essentiellement, que les directives concernant la preuve et la procédure peuvent raisonnablement être laissées de côté, la seule partie des directives devant être prise en compte étant ce qui motive effectivement la crainte d'être persécuté. Mais la demanderesse soutient que rien dans la jurisprudence ne justifie un tel morcellement et que la proposition avancée sur ce point par le défendeur a quelque chose d'artificiel.
[23]
La demanderesse admet qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de se référer aux Directives dans la mesure où elles sont appliquées pour l'essentiel, mais lorsque, comme c'est le cas en l'occurrence, on s'écarte des directives, on est, juridiquement, tenu d'expliquer pourquoi. La demanderesse cite
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] ACF no 462, qui, selon elle, pose le principe que l'obligation de prendre en compte les considérations d'ordre culturel lorsqu'il s'agit d'évaluer la crédibilité d'une revendicatrice de statut ne s'applique pas uniquement lorsque celle-ci craint d'être persécutée en raison de son sexe.
[24]
Selon la demanderesse, l'obligation de divulguer les éléments de preuve extrinsèques et de donner la possibilité d'y répondre ne s'applique pas seulement aux éléments de preuve extrinsèques dont la recherche n'a pas été signalée. Le seul fait d'avoir dit à la demanderesse que ses documents feraient l'objet d'une vérification, ne lui a aucunement permis de savoir ce qu'entraînerait cette vérification. Le seul fait d'avertir la demanderesse qu'il y aurait une vérification ne lui procurait pas l'occasion de répondre aux résultats de la vérification, car pour être en mesure de répondre à un document émanant d'un tiers, il lui fallait pouvoir effectivement le consulter ou, à tout le moins, s'en voir remettre un résumé explicatif. Le seul fait de savoir qu'un tel document va être produit n'offre pas au demandeur l'occasion raisonnable d'y répondre.
Analyse et décision
Première question en litige
Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable en l'espèce?
[25]
Lorsque la jurisprudence a précisé la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[26]
La Cour a examiné au regard de la norme de la décision raisonnable le fait de ne pas avoir pris en compte les Directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF no 1050; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 18, [2010] ACF no 295). En examinant la décision de l'agent au regard de la norme de la raisonnabilité, la Cour ne doit pas intervenir, à moins qu'il soit parvenu à une conclusion dénuée de transparence, de justification et d'intelligibilité et qui n'appartient pas aux issues acceptables compte tenu de la preuve produite (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Ainsi que la Cour l'a rappelé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, il n'appartient pas à la cour de révision de substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable, pas plus qu'il ne lui appartient de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve (paragraphes 59 et 61).
[27]
Il est bien établi en droit qu'en ce qui concerne les questions d'équité procédurale, la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision correcte (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 43). S'agissant de questions de cet ordre, la cour de révision n'a pas à faire preuve de déférence envers le décideur (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 50).
[28]
J'entends maintenant aborder la troisième question soulevée.
Troisième question en litige
La non-divulgation d'éléments de preuve extrinsèques, et le fait de ne pas avoir donné la possibilité d'y répondre, ont-ils entraîné un manquement à l'obligation d'équité?
[29]
Selon la jurisprudence de la Cour, en règle générale, lorsqu'un agent possède de l'information extrinsèque dont le demandeur n'est pas au courant, ce dernier devrait avoir l'occasion de dissiper chez l'agent les réserves découlant de cette preuve (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 203; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 25, [2010] ACF no 624). Citons, parmi les éléments de preuve extrinsèques n'ayant pas été communiqués au demandeur, et ayant pour cela entraîné une violation de son droit à l'équité procédurale, des contrats commerciaux frauduleux (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 65), des renseignements fournis par un responsable de l'ancien employeur de la demanderesse (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). Les demandeurs n'ont, dans aucune de ces affaires, eu l'occasion de répondre à des éléments de preuve extrinsèques considérés comme essentiels aux décisions prises par l'agent. À l'inverse, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1037, le fait qu'un agent ait pris en compte la preuve que les états financiers de la demanderesse avaient été établis par un certain cabinet d'expertise comptable n'a pas été jugé contraire à l'équité procédurale, car il n'a pas fondé sur cette preuve sa décision finale.
[30]
En l'espèce, la demanderesse et son époux ont été, au cours de l'entrevue, mis au courant des doutes qu'éprouvait l'agent quant à l'authenticité des attestations de l'ONARS. Dans les notes qu'il a consignées, le 21 mars 2012, au STIDI, l'agent précise qu'il a [traduction] « fait état des doutes qu'il éprouvait à l'égard des documents, demandé à la demanderesse principale et à son mari s'il pouvait vérifier les documents auprès de l'ONARS et qu'ils ont répondu oui » ajoutant plus loin qu'il [traduction] « avait, dès le début de l'entrevue, fait part des doutes qu'il éprouvait quant à l'authenticité des documents ».
[31]
Plus tard, dans les notes consignées le 28 mars 2012 au STIDI, l'agent a inscrit la mention [traduction] « [v]érification effectuée: l'ONARS confirme que les attestations concernant la demanderesse principale et son époux ne sont pas authentiques», ajoutant qu'il a [traduction] « fait part des doutes que lui inspirait le document, [s]es doutes étant confirmés par l'autorité compétente pour délivrer ce type de documents ». L'inauthenticité des attestations a alors compté parmi les motifs portant l'agent à rejeter la revendication de la demanderesse.
[32]
Le défendeur soutient que l'agent a, dès le début de l'entrevue du 21 mars 2012, mis la demanderesse et son époux au courant des préoccupations qu'il éprouvait, donnant amplement aux intéressés l'occasion de s'expliquer et de participer pleinement à l'examen de leur demande. C'est exact, mais là n'est pas la question. Ce qui est en cause c'est le fait que l'agent aurait alors reçu de l'ONARS des renseignements sur lesquels il s'est en partie fondé pour rejeter la revendication de la demanderesse, et auxquels celle-ci n'a pas eu la possibilité de répondre. Le dossier ne permet d'ailleurs pas de connaître la nature des renseignements transmis à l'agent par l'ONARS, ou de savoir comment l'ONARS a pu confirmer le manque d'authenticité des attestations. Les notes du STIDI ne permettent pas de savoir à quels arguments la demanderesse avait à répondre (d'autant plus qu'elle n'avait même pas été mise au courant de ce nouvel élément), et ne permettent pas non plus à la Cour d'évaluer de manière satisfaisante le caractère raisonnable de la décision. Selon la jurisprudence citée plus haut, l'agent a manqué à l'équité procédurale, et la décision devrait être renvoyée à un autre agent pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision.
[33]
Compte tenu de la conclusion à laquelle je suis parvenu au sujet de la troisième question en litige, il n'y a pas lieu pour moi de me pencher sur la deuxième.
[34]
La demanderesse me soumet, en vue de leur certification, deux questions de portée générale:
[traduction]
1. L'obligation juridique de prendre en compte les Directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe concerne-t-elle uniquement, pour les demandes de visa présentées au titre de la catégorie des réfugiés au sens de la Convention outre-frontières ou de la catégorie des personnes protégées à titre humanitaire outre-frontières, les demandes fondées sur la crainte d'être persécuté en raison de son sexe?
2. Lors d'une demande de visa présentée au titre de la catégorie des réfugiés au sens de la Convention outre-frontières ou de la catégorie des personnes protégées à titre humanitaire outre-frontières, le bureau des visas qui prend en compte des éléments de preuve extrinsèques satisfait-il à l'obligation d'équité qui lui incombe en faisant savoir qu'il entend recourir à des éléments de preuve extrinsèques, et en en indiquant la source, dans la mesure où il ne divulgue pas les éléments extrinsèques qu'il a obtenus et ne donne pas la possibilité d'y répondre?
[35]
Le défendeur, qui n'a pas souhaité me soumettre de question, s'oppose à la certification des questions soumises par la demanderesse.
[36]
Je ne suis pas disposé à certifier l'une ou l'autre de ces questions, car elles n'abordent ni l'une ni l'autre des éléments ayant des conséquences importantes ou qui sont de portée générale (voir
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[37]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie.
JUGEMENT
[38]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, que la décision de l'agent est annulée et que l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision.
