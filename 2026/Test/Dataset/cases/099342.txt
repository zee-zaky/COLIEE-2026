[1]
O'Keefe, J.
: The applicant's claim for refugee protection was denied by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board). He now applies for judicial review of that decision pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act].
[2]
The applicant seeks an order setting aside the negative decision and returning the matter to a different member of the Board for redetermination.
I.
Background
[3]
The applicant, born on August 15, 1985, is a citizen of Mexico. He lived in the state of Aguascalientes.
[4]
Prior to coming to Canada, the applicant took over his family's real estate business in January 2006. In March 2006, he received extortion threats from the criminal organization La Familia Michoacán (LFM) to pay money to Carlos Zamarripa. After this threat, his father informed the applicant that there is a history of extortion demands. The applicant decided not to comply against the advice from his father. He did not report it to the police but instead sought help from the son of the local mayor and also his friend. It was inconsequential.
[5]
In April 2006, the LFM kidnapped the applicant and demanded payment of 25,000 pesos every month or they would kill him. On May 16, 2006, two men approached the applicant, warned him to pay and then hit him. The applicant reported to the police later that day, but police stated they were unable to protect him. On June 5, 2006, he was again kidnapped. The next day, his family helped him to go to Mexico City and on June 22, 2006 he left Mexico to come to Canada.
[6]
Since arriving in Canada, the applicant returned to Mexico twice. The first time was for a month from December 2006 to January 2007 and the second time was for a month from January 2008 to February 2008. The first time was to get money from his father to pay for his education in Canada and renew his visa. The second time was also to renew his student visa. On January 23, 2008 while in Mexico City during his second visit, an unidentified person shot at the applicant's car. The police informed him to report the incident in his hometown.
[7]
The applicant left Mexico on February 15, 2008 before his student visa was renewed and arrived in Canada on the same day. His student visa was ultimately not renewed. In March 2008, he signed a voluntary deportation form when he met with an immigration officer in Calgary. He stayed in Canada and married a Canadian citizen. His then-wife never filed a spousal sponsorship application. The applicant learned from a community center that he could not file for refugee status while being married to a Canadian citizen. He divorced his then-wife with reasons unclear as to whether or not it was connected to his claim for refugee status. He claimed refugee status on September 27, 2011.
II.
Decision Under Review.
[8]
The Board refused the applicant's claim and communicated its decision on July 10, 2013.
[9]
After summarizing the applicant's claims and its analysis, the Board concluded that it did not find the applicant to be a Convention refugee and/or a person in need of protection.
[10]
The Board made its decision and reasoning based on three grounds: i) the lack of subjective fear, ii) credibility issue, and iii) the presence of a viable internal flight alternative (IFA).
[11]
First, on the ground of subjective fear, the Board did not accept the applicant's explanations for failing to claim refugee status on his first available opportunity in Canada. Here, the applicant explained that he had a student permit and did not know about refugee protection because he had not spoken with any Spanish speakers in Canada. The Board found the applicant's reason "unsatisfactory and implausible."
[12]
Also, the Board found the applicant's reasons for returning on two occasions to Mexico unreasonable and perceived the repeated reavailment being inconsistent with a subjective fear of persecution.
[13]
The Board noted the applicant's then-wife, a Canadian citizen, failed to file a spousal sponsorship application on his behalf. The applicant explained his then-wife told him not to worry and he trusted her. He provided into evidence his divorce certificate. The Board found the applicant's explanation "for not making any efforts to acquire status, in light of his alleged fear of persecution, to be unreasonable."
[14]
The Board then went on to address the three and one-half years in the applicant's delay in filing for protection after he had arrived in Canada, the last time in 2008. The Board first found it was unreasonable that when the applicant's student visa was not renewed, he did not inquire into other options of staying in Canada. It then found it unreasonable that the applicant divorced his then-wife after he received misinformation from a community center in 2011, advising him that he could not apply for refugee status while married to a Canadian. The Board further stated it found it unreasonable that since 2008, he did not know about applying for refugee protection, that he did not connect with the Spanish community considering he is an "independent, resourceful, outgoing, educated person".
[15]
The Board acknowledged in its reasoning that, "[w]hile delay in claiming is not a decisive factor it is relevant to an assessment of a claimant's subjective fear." The Board's negative inference was based on the applicant's cumulative failures to seek protection when he had the opportunities and the reavailment to Mexico, which it concluded were inconsistent with a showing of subjective fear.
[16]
Second, the Board found the applicant had credibility issues. This included that there were family secrets regarding the extortion demands and the fact that no family member resumed the family business after the applicant left. In particular, the Board found it was not plausible that the applicant's family did not inform him of every aspect of running the family business, especially the history of extortion demands. The Board also found the applicant's "explanation for his brothers' decisions not to continue the family business to be unreasonable and not credible."
[17]
For these issues, the Board found that it had insufficient reliable or trustworthy evidence to find the applicant faces "a well-founded fear of persecution or credible risk of harm in Mexico today given the demonstrated lack of subjective fear noted above."
[18]
Third, the Board found the applicant did have a viable and reasonable IFA in Mexico City, Merida or Hermosillo. In reaching its determination on this issue, the Board relied on documentary evidence. The evidence provides that the comprehensive personal identification database is lacking in Mexico.
III.
Issues
[19]
The applicant submits three issues for my consideration:
1. Did the Board err in finding that the applicant had a reasonable IFA?
2. Were the Board's findings on subjective fear unreasonable?
3. Did the Board err in making plausibility findings?
[20]
The respondent replies that there is only one issue: "whether the Applicant has raised an arguable case for the success of a future judicial review application."
[21]
I prefer the applicant's separation of issues and thereby state the issues as follows:
A. What is the standard of review?
B. Did the Board assess IFA unreasonably?
C. Did the Board assess subjective fear unreasonably?
D. Did the Board assess plausibility unreasonably?
IV.
Applicant's Written Submissions
[22]
The applicant submits, based on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the issues in this case are of mixed fact and law, and therefore reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
[23]
The applicant submits that on the issue of IFA, the Board erred in evaluating the two criteria in establishing the existence of an IFA: 1) a serious risk of persecution throughout the country, and 2) a proposed alternative must not be unreasonable given the circumstances of the individual claimant.
[24]
First, regarding the presence of a serious risk of persecution throughout the country, the Board did not consider the motivation or other means the LFM might have to track down the applicant beyond an electronic database, such as the widespread reach of gang violence.
[25]
Second, regarding whether or not the proposed alternative is unreasonable, the Board did not assess the specific risks to the applicant in the identified IFAs, instead the Board looked at overall corruption or crime rates in the IFAs. Mexico City is an unreasonable identified IFA, because the applicant was shot at while in Mexico City after calling his parents in Aguascalientes. Also, the Board is required to assess the IFAs' reasonableness beyond good employment prospects and lower crime rates.
[26]
On the issue of subjective fear, the applicant submits it was unreasonable for the Board to base its finding on a delay in a refugee claim, reavailment and the applicant's ex-wife's failure to apply for spousal sponsorship.
[27]
First, regarding the delay in claiming, the applicant cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] FCJ No 1387 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], that a valid temporary status was a legitimate reason for not claiming refugee protection at an earlier opportunity. Here, the applicant had a valid study permit and then got married. As for the subsequent denial of a study permit, it was based on insufficient funding, not because he only remained in school for two months. Also, the applicant's delay was not indicative of a lack of subjective fear, but a lack of knowledge of his legal options.
[28]
Second, regarding reavailment, the applicant submits that his return to Mexico lacks voluntariness and an intention to reside there. He cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2003] FCJ No 1830 at paragraph 35 that "a temporary visit by a refugee to the country where persecution was feared without an intention to permanently reside there should not result in the loss of refugee status." Here, the applicant went back to Mexico the first time to apply for his visa and the second time again to apply for his visa. However, he never returned to his home state at Aguascalientes and did not intend to remain in Mexico.
[29]
Third, regarding the applicant's ex-wife's failure to sponsor him, the applicant submits it was "unreasonable for the Member to make such sweeping generalizations about how the Applicant should have behaved in his marriage." Also, the Board unreasonably considered the applicant's marital breakdown as a solely premised desire to apply for refugee protection.
[30]
On the issue of plausibility, the applicant submits the Board did not make a clear distinction between credibility and plausibility findings and the plausibility findings were not based on any clear evidence. He cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 5 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], which requires there to be a distinction between credibility findings and the threat posed being implausible and that implausibility findings must only be made in the clearest of cases. The applicant submits he wants a clean break in Canada so he did not contact anyone in the Spanish community and such is not outside of the realm of possibility. The applicant argues that the Board's plausibility findings are based on mere speculation and therefore this is a reviewable error under
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 201. This includes speculation on the lack of continuation of the applicant's family business and the lack of communication on extortion history to the applicant.
V.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[31]
The respondent submits the standard of review in this case should be reasonableness. Referencing
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the respondent submits significant deference should be given to the Board. The respondent argues that the Board did not make any reviewable error.
[32]
On the issue of subjective fear, the respondent reiterates the Board's finding that the delay in claiming refugee status is inconsistent with a subjective fear. Relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] FCJ No 402, the respondent submits the failure to show a subjective fear of persecution is fatal to a claim. It is not unreasonable to expect the applicant to make some inquires about his immigration options in the three and one-half year delay, if he was truly afraid for his life.
[33]
For reavailment, the respondent relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 1550 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], where the Court in that case found multiple reavailments to the country of persecution undermined an applicant's subjective fear in the absence of a compelling reason for such reavailment. In particular, the respondent emphasizes the similarity between that case and the present case, quoting <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> "[a]lthough Mr. Kostrzewa testified that he had a valid student visa during that period and was unaware of the possibility of applying for refugee protection until shortly before he submitted his application, it was not unreasonable for the Board to draw a negative inference regarding his subjective fear, based on his failure to apply for protection within a reasonable period of time after his arrival in Canada (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA))."
[34]
The respondent further submits that most of the applicant's arguments constitute a request to reweigh the evidence, which is not the role of this Court. It argues that the Board considered all the material before it and the reasons for its decision clearly state why the claim failed.
[35]
On the issue of plausibility, relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 1685, the respondent submits the applicant did not provide independent documentary evidence to alleviate the Board's concerns. It is the Board's role to assess the credibility of the evidence, which includes inconsistencies and contradictions. Further, the applicant has not overcome the presumption that the Board considered all the evidence, and rather, the applicant's argument is based on the assessment of weight assigned to the evidence.
[36]
On the issue of IFA, citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the respondent agrees with the applicant that there are two criteria in establishing an IFA. The respondent submits the alleged risk of the IFAs to the applicant was properly assessed and the applicant has a high burden to show an IFA location is unreasonable: "[I]t requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions." (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The respondent submits the Board considered the applicant's assertion that if returned, he will be located by the LFM and concluded it as a matter of speculation lacking solid evidence.
VI.
Analysis and Decision
A.
Issue 1 - What is the standard of review?
[37]
Both parties in this case submit the reasonableness standard should be adopted. I agree. Here, the issues under review are a mix of fact and law. Where the jurisprudence has satisfactorily resolved the standard of review, the analysis need not be repeated (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 62).
[38]
It has been established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 53, that the standard of reasonableness is applied "where the legal and factual issues are intertwined with and cannot be readily separated." (see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 315; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 369 at paragraphs 22 to 40).
[39]
The standard of reasonableness means that I should not intervene if the Board's decision is transparent, justifiable, intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47). Here, I will set aside the Board's decision only if I cannot understand why it reached its conclusions or how the facts and applicable law support the outcome (see
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 59 and 61, a court reviewing for reasonableness cannot substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor can it reweigh the evidence.
B.
Issue 2 - Did the Board assess IFA unreasonably?
[40]
Pursuant to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and further confirmed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, in determining whether a reasonable IFA exists, it is well settled that the applicant bears the onus to prove that 1) on a balance of probabilities, there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, including the area which is alleged to afford an IFA; and 2) the conditions in the proposed IFA must be such that it would be unreasonable, upon consideration of all the circumstances, including the applicant's personal circumstances, for the applicant to seek refuge.
[41]
Here, I do not agree with the applicant that the Board assessed IFA unreasonably. It seems to me the applicant's arguments are based on the appropriateness in weighing evidence. The applicant submits the Board's determination is unreasonable because it did not consider the motivation or other means the LFM might have to track down the applicant beyond electronic database. Also, he states the Board failed to assess the IFA's reasonableness beyond good employment prospects and lower crime rates. The applicant submits the identified IFA, Mexico City, is unreasonable because of the gang's widespread violence and alternative means to track him. In particular, the applicant asserted during his Board hearing that an unidentified person shot at him during his second visit to Mexico.
[42]
As demonstrated from the Board's reasoning, I am satisfied that it considered the evidence before it, including both the documentary evidence and the applicant's assertions. The Board is not required to mention every piece of evidence in the decision (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2004] FCJ No 758). Under the standard of reasonableness, my role is not to reweigh the evidence, but to assess whether or not the Board's decision falls within a range of acceptable outcomes. I agree with the respondent that the applicant is asking this Court to reweigh the evidence, which is not my role. Here, the Board ultimately found the proposed IFAs were reasonable. To be reasonable, the Board does not have to come to the same conclusion as the applicant.
[43]
Also, I see no reason to infer the Board has either ignored or misconstrued evidence. I find that the Board's conclusion that the agents of persecution do not have the interest, motivation, means or resources to pursue the applicant in the IFA areas does fall within the range of acceptable outcomes.
C.
Issue 3 - Did the Board assess subjective fear unreasonably?
[44]
The Board based its negative inference on subjective fear on two major grounds: i) the delay in the refugee claim and ii) reavailment. In the area of delay, the applicant submits the Board unreasonably inferred from it the lack of subjective fear. The applicant states the delay was reasonable because he had legal student visa status, then married his then-wife and entrusted her to apply for spousal sponsorship. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 16 and 18, this Court found an applicant's valid temporary status was a legitimate reason for not claiming refugee protection at an earlier opportunity:
[16] Although case law generally indicates that failure to apply for refugee status immediately upon arrival or within a reasonable delay can be an important factor to consider in determining a claimant's credibility (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), there exist situations in which negative inferences may not be drawn and failure to apply for refugee status immediately upon arrival in a Convention country cannot be the sole basis for questioning a claimant's credibility.
...
[18] In the case at bar, the applicant had a student visa and had also made an application for permanent residency. It is clear that it was not until he lost his financial support from his family in Nepal that he feared having to return there because he could no longer pay for his studies. Clearly there is a direct parallel with the sailor on the ship who is finally given leave and has nowhere to go but home. Both had left home for fear of persecution and had found a safe place to stay and work, so much so that they did not feel the need to apply for refugee status as they were safe for the time being. Suddenly, both found themselves in peril of returning home through circumstances over which they had no power or influence and immediately filed a claim.
[45]
On the other hand, the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> found a valid student visa does not make a board's negative inference unreasonable (see paragraph 33 of these reasons).
[46]
Here, I find the present case is more similar to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and agree with Chief Justice Paul S. Crampton in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the Board's negative inference falls within the range of acceptable outcomes.
[47]
I now turn my analysis to reavailment. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this Court found multiple reavailments to the country of persecution undermined the applicant's subjective fear in the absence of a compelling reason for such reavailment.
[48]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this Court found at paragraph 35, "a temporary visit by a refugee to the country where persecution was feared without an intention to permanently reside there should not result in the loss of refugee status."
[49]
Here, the applicant went back to Mexico twice, each time for the renewal of his student visa. He did not return to his home state and only stayed in Mexico temporarily for one month each time. In my view, his returns do not constitute reavailment. Since the determination of subjective fear was made based on both grounds of delay and reavailment, I cannot guess what decision the Board would have made if not for this error. Therefore, the Board made an error here.
D.
Issue 4 - Did the Board assess plausibility unreasonably?
[50]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this Court clarified a distinction between credibility findings and the threat posed being implausible and stated implausibility findings must only be made in the clearest of cases. Mr. Justice Richard Mosley explained in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2004] FCJ No 1149:
... [P]lausibility findings involve a distinct reasoning process from findings of credibility and can be influenced by cultural assumptions or misunderstandings. Therefore, implausibility determinations must be based on clear evidence, as well as a clear rationalization process supporting the Board's inferences, and should refer to relevant evidence which could potentially refute such conclusions.
[51]
This rationale is again emphasized by this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1438.
[52]
Here, the Board found the applicant had credibility issues because of unreasonable explanations related to family secrets regarding the extortion demands and the fact that no family member resumed the family business after the applicant left. The Board found that it had insufficient reliable or trustworthy evidence to find the applicant faces "a well-founded fear of persecution or credible risk of harm in Mexico." These speculations concern the applicant's family dynamic, instead of the refugee claim at hand. I think they were influenced by possible cultural assumptions.
[53]
Therefore, I do not see the clear rationalization process supporting the Board's negative inferences. The Board's plausibility findings fail under the review of reasonableness.
[54]
Although the Board made errors on the assessment of subjective fear and plausibility findings, these errors are not dispositive of the matter. I have found that the Board's decision with respect to the existence of an IFA for the applicant to be a reasonable decision. This means that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of nationality. For a refugee claim to succeed, the applicant must have a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of nationality. Because of the existence of an IFA, he does not have such a fear.
[55]
As a result, the applicant's application for judicial review must be dismissed.
[56]
Neither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.
JUDGMENT
[57]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed.

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada (la Commission) a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur. Ce dernier sollicite maintenant le contrôle judiciaire de cette décision conformément au paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi).
[2]
Le demandeur cherche à obtenir une ordonnance annulant cette décision défavorable et renvoyant l'affaire à la Commission pour qu'un autre commissaire rende une nouvelle décision.
I.
Contexte
[3]
Le demandeur, né le 15 août 1985, est citoyen mexicain. Il a vécu dans l'État d'Aguascalientes.
[4]
Avant de venir au Canada, il a pris, en janvier 2006, les rênes de l'entreprise de services immobiliers de sa famille. En mars 2006, il a reçu des menaces d'extorsion d'une organisation criminelle, La Familia Michoacán (LFM), qui voulait l'obliger à verser de l'argent à Carlos Zamarripa. À la suite de ces menaces, son père l'a informé que ce n'était pas la première fois que cela arrivait. Le demandeur a décidé de ne pas se plier aux demandes malgré les conseils de son père. Il n'a pas signalé l'incident à la police, mais a plutôt demandé l'aide de son ami, le fils du maire de la région. Cela n'a eu aucun effet.
[5]
En avril 2006, la LFM a enlevé le demandeur et exigé qu'il leur verse 25 000 pesos par mois, sous peine de le tuer. Le 16 mai 2006, deux hommes ont abordé le demandeur, l'ont sommé de verser la somme exigée et l'ont ensuite battu. Le demandeur a porté plainte à la police plus tard dans la journée, mais celle-ci lui a dit qu'elle ne pouvait pas le protéger. Le 5 juin 2006, il a encore été enlevé. Le lendemain, sa famille l'a aidé à se rendre à Mexico, et, le 22 juin 2006, il est parti pour le Canada.
[6]
Depuis son arrivée au Canada, le demandeur est retourné deux fois au Mexique: la première fois pour un mois, de décembre 2006 à janvier 2007, et la deuxième fois pour un mois également, de janvier 2008 à février 2008. La première fois, c'était pour obtenir de l'argent de son père pour payer ses études au Canada et renouveler son visa, et, la deuxième fois, c'était également pour renouveler son visa d'étudiant. Le 23 janvier 2008, lors de sa deuxième visite, un individu a tiré des coups de feu dans sa direction alors qu'il était dans sa voiture à Mexico. La police lui a dit de signaler l'incident aux autorités de sa ville.
[7]
Le demandeur a quitté le Mexique le 15 février 2008 avant le renouvellement de son visa d'étudiant et il est arrivé au Canada le même jour. Son visa d'étudiant n'a finalement pas été renouvelé. En mars 2008, il a signé un formulaire de départ volontaire lorsqu'il a rencontré un agent d'immigration à Calgary. Il est toutefois resté au Canada et s'est marié avec une citoyenne canadienne. Cette dernière n'a jamais déposé de demande de parrainage. Le demandeur a appris dans un centre communautaire qu'il ne pouvait pas demander l'asile s'il était marié à une citoyenne canadienne. Il a divorcé, mais il n'a pas été précisé clairement si le divorce avait un lien avec la demande d'asile, laquelle a été présentée le 27 septembre 2011.
II.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[8]
La Commission a rejeté la demande d'asile et communiqué sa décision le 10 juillet 2013.
[9]
Après avoir résumé les revendications du demandeur et son analyse, la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'était ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger.
[10]
La Commission a fondé sa décision et son raisonnement sur trois motifs: i) l'absence de crainte subjective, ii) la question de la crédibilité et iii) l'existence d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) viable.
[11]
Premièrement, en ce qui a trait à la crainte subjective, la Commission n'a pas accepté l'explication du demandeur pour justifier pourquoi il n'avait pas demandé l'asile dès la première occasion qui s'est offerte à lui au Canada, à savoir qu'il avait un visa d'étudiant et qu'il ne savait pas qu'il pouvait demander l'asile parce qu'il n'avait pas établi de liens avec des hispanophones au Canada. La Commission a conclu que l'explication du demandeur était « insatisfaisante et invraisemblable ».
[12]
De plus, la Commission a jugé déraisonnables les raisons données par le demandeur pour justifier qu'il était retourné deux fois au Mexique et a considéré le fait qu'il se soit réclamé de la protection de ce pays à plusieurs reprises comme étant incompatible avec une crainte subjective de persécution.
[13]
La Commission a indiqué que l'ex-épouse du demandeur, une citoyenne canadienne, n'avait pas présenté de demande de parrainage pour lui. Le demandeur a expliqué que cette dernière lui avait dit de ne pas s'inquiéter et qu'il lui avait fait confiance. Il a versé en preuve son certificat de divorce. La Commission a jugé « déraisonnable » l'explication qu'il a donnée pour justifier le fait qu'il « n'a déployé aucun effort pour régulariser sa situation, compte tenu de sa prétendue crainte de persécution ».
[14]
La Commission s'est ensuite interrogée sur le fait qu'il avait attendu trois ans et demi avant de demander l'asile après son entrée au Canada, la dernière fois en 2008. La Commission a d'abord jugé déraisonnable qu'il n'ait pas exploré d'autres options pour rester au Canada lorsqu'il s'est vu dans l'impossibilité de faire renouveler son visa d'étudiant. Elle a ensuite jugé déraisonnable que le demandeur ait divorcé d'avec son épouse après avoir reçu d'un centre communautaire, en 2011, des renseignements erronés suivant lesquels il ne pouvait présenter une demande d'asile s'il était marié à une Canadienne. La Commission a de plus affirmé qu'elle jugeait déraisonnable qu'il n'ait jamais su, depuis 2008, qu'il pouvait demander l'asile et qu'il ne soit pas entré en communication avec la communauté hispanique eu égard au fait qu'il est « autonome, débrouillard, extraverti et instruit ».
[15]
La Commission a reconnu dans ses motifs que « [m]ême si le fait de tarder à présenter une demande d'asile n'est pas un facteur décisif, il s'avère pertinent au moment d'évaluer la crainte subjective d'un demandeur d'asile ». L'inférence défavorable de la Commission se basait sur le fait qu'il avait manqué plusieurs occasions de demander l'asile et sur le fait qu'il s'était réclamé de nouveau de la protection du Mexique, ce qui était, a-t-elle conclu, incompatible avec l'existence d'une crainte subjective.
[16]
Deuxièmement, la Commission était d'avis que le demandeur n'était pas crédible, en raison notamment des secrets de famille concernant les demandes d'extorsion et du fait qu'aucun membre de la famille n'avait repris les rênes de l'entreprise familiale après son départ. En particulier, la Commission a conclu qu'il était peu vraisemblable que la famille du demandeur ne l'ait pas informé de tous les aspects de l'exploitation de l'entreprise familiale, en particulier des demandes d'extorsion antérieures. La Commission a également jugé « déraisonnable et non crédible l'explication donnée par le demandeur d'asile pour justifier la décision de ses frères de ne pas reprendre l'entreprise familiale ».
[17]
Pour ces questions, la Commission était d'avis qu'elle ne disposait pas de suffisamment d'éléments de preuve fiables ou dignes de foi pour conclure que le demandeur « craint avec raison d'être persécuté ou qu'il est exposé à un risque crédible de préjudice au Mexique aujourd'hui, étant donné l'absence de crainte subjective établie ci-dessus ».
[18]
Troisièmement, la Commission a conclu que le demandeur avait bel et bien une PRI viable et raisonnable à Mexico, à Mérida ou à Hermosillo. Pour parvenir à cette conclusion, la Commission s'est appuyée sur la preuve documentaire, selon laquelle il n'existe pas de base complète de données d'identification personnelle au Mexique.
III.
Questions en litige
[19]
Le demandeur soumet les trois questions suivantes à mon examen:
1. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le demandeur avait une PRI raisonnable?
2. Les conclusions de la Commission concernant la crainte subjective étaient-elles déraisonnables?
3. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en tirant des conclusions d'invraisemblance?
[20]
Le défendeur répond que le litige porte sur la seule question de savoir si le demandeur a soulevé une cause défendable qui lui permettrait d'obtenir gain de cause dans une demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[21]
Je préfère les questions distinctes du demandeur, que je reformule comme suit:
A. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
B. L'évaluation de la PRI par la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
C. L'évaluation de la crainte subjective par la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
D. L'évaluation de la vraisemblance par la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
IV.
Observations écrites du demandeur
[22]
S'appuyant sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), le demandeur soutient que les questions en l'espèce sont des questions mixtes de fait et de droit et que, par conséquent, elles sont sujettes à révision suivant la norme de la décision raisonnable.
[23]
En ce qui a trait à la question de la PRI, le demandeur fait valoir que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a évalué les deux critères suivants pour établir l'existence d'une PRI: 1) le risque grave de persécution dans tout le pays; 2) la possibilité de refuge proposée ne doit pas être déraisonnable eu égard à la situation du demandeur d'asile visé.
[24]
Premièrement, en ce qui concerne l'existence d'un risque grave de persécution dans tout le pays, la Commission n'a pas examiné la motivation ou d'autres moyens qu'une base de données électronique que la LFM pourrait avoir pour pourchasser le demandeur, par exemple le recours largement répandu à des gangs criminels.
[25]
Deuxièmement, en ce qui concerne la question de savoir si la possibilité de refuge proposée est déraisonnable, la Commission n'a pas évalué les risques particuliers auxquels serait exposé le demandeur dans les PRI proposées: elle a plutôt examiné les taux de corruption ou de criminalité dans leur ensemble. Or, Mexico est une PRI déraisonnable parce que le demandeur y a été la cible de coups de feu après avoir appelé ses parents à Aguascalientes. De plus, la Commission est tenue d'évaluer le caractère raisonnable de la PRI sans se borner aux bonnes perspectives d'emploi et au taux de criminalité plus bas.
[26]
À propos de la crainte subjective, le demandeur soutient qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de la Commission de fonder sa conclusion sur la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile, sur le fait qu'il se soit réclamé à nouveau de la protection de son pays de nationalité et sur le fait que son ex-épouse ne l'ait pas parrainé.
[27]
Premièrement, en ce qui concerne la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile, le demandeur fait valoir, citant à l'appui
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] ACF no 1387 (la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), qu'un statut temporaire valide était un motif légitime pour ne pas demander l'asile dès la première occasion. En l'espèce, le demandeur avait un permis d'études valide et il s'est ensuite marié. Le refus subséquent d'un permis d'études était attribuable à un manque d'argent, et non au fait qu'il avait fréquenté un établissement scolaire pendant deux mois seulement. De plus, la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile n'indiquait pas une absence de crainte subjective, mais un manque de connaissance des options juridiques qui s'offraient à lui.
[28]
Deuxièmement, en ce qui concerne le fait qu'il se soit réclamé à nouveau de la protection de son pays de nationalité, le demandeur soutient que son retour au Mexique n'avait rien de volontaire et qu'il n'avait pas l'intention d'y résider. Il invoque
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2003] ACF no 1830, au paragraphe 35, où la Cour affirme qu'« un séjour temporaire par un réfugié dans le pays où il craint la persécution, alors qu'il n'a pas l'intention d'y établir sa résidence permanente, ne devrait pas impliquer la perte du statut de réfugié ». En l'espèce, le demandeur est retourné au Mexique la première fois pour présenter une demande de visa et la deuxième fois pour renouveler son visa. Toutefois, il n'est jamais retourné chez lui à Aguascalientes et il n'avait pas l'intention de rester au Mexique.
[29]
Troisièmement, en ce qui concerne le fait que son ex-épouse ne l'a pas parrainé, le demandeur soutient qu'il était [traduction] « déraisonnable de la part de la commissaire de faire des généralisations abusives sur ce qu'il aurait dû faire pendant qu'il était marié ». Il était également déraisonnable de la part de la Commission de présumer qu'il avait divorcé uniquement parce qu'il souhaitait présenter une demande d'asile.
[30]
Sur la question de la vraisemblance, le demandeur soutient que la Commission n'a pas clairement distingué les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité et celles relatives à la vraisemblance et que les conclusions relatives à la vraisemblance n'étaient pas étayées par une preuve claire. Il cite
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF no 5 (la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), qui exige qu'une distinction soit établie entre les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité et la conclusion voulant que la menace posée soit invraisemblable et indique que les conclusions d'invraisemblance ne doivent être tirées que dans les cas les plus évidents. Le demandeur soutient qu'il n'a pas pris contact avec la communauté hispanique parce qu'il voulait faire une rupture nette et que cela n'était pas impossible. Le demandeur allègue que les conclusions relatives à l'invraisemblance se fondent sur de simples hypothèses et que, par conséquent, la Commission a commis une erreur donnant matière à révision, comme dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 201. La Commission a notamment émis des hypothèses sur le fait que l'entreprise familiale n'avait pas poursuivi ses activités et sur le fait que le demandeur n'avait pas été informé des demandes d'extorsion antérieures.
V.
Observations écrites du défendeur
[31]
Le défendeur soutient que la norme de contrôle applicable en l'espèce devrait être celle de la décision raisonnable. S'appuyant sur
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), il affirme que la Cour doit faire preuve de beaucoup de retenue à l'égard de la décision de la Commission. Il fait valoir que la Commission n'a commis aucune erreur susceptible de révision.
[32]
À propos de la crainte subjective, le défendeur réitère la conclusion de la Commission suivant laquelle la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile est incompatible avec une crainte subjective.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] ACF no 402, il soutient que le défaut d'établir l'existence d'une crainte subjective de persécution porte un coup fatal à la demande d'asile. Il n'est pas déraisonnable de s'attendre à ce que, durant la période de trois ans et demi qui s'est écoulée avant la présentation de sa demande d'asile, le demandeur se renseigne sur les options qui s'offraient à lui pour immigrer, s'il craignait vraiment pour sa vie.
[33]
En ce qui a trait au fait que le demandeur se soit réclamé de nouveau de la protection de l'État, le défendeur s'appuie sur
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 1550 (la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), où la Cour a conclu que le fait de se réclamer plusieurs fois de la protection du pays de persécution mine la crainte subjective du demandeur s'il n'a pas de raisons impérieuses de le faire. En particulier, le défendeur insiste sur la similarité entre cette affaire-là et celle qui nous occupe, citant un extrait de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « Bien que dans son témoignage M. Kostrzewa ait déclaré qu'il avait eu un visa d'étudiant valable pendant cette période, et qu'il n'a été au courant de la possibilité de présenter une demande d'asile que peu de temps avant de présenter sa demande, il n'était pas déraisonnable que la Commission ait tiré une inférence défavorable relativement à sa crainte subjective, sur la base de son omission de présenter une demande d'asile pendant une période raisonnable de temps, après son arrivée au Canada (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). »
[34]
Le défendeur soutient également que la plupart des arguments du demandeur constituent une invitation à apprécier de nouveau la preuve, et ce n'est pas le rôle de la Cour. Il fait valoir que la Commission a examiné tous les documents dont elle disposait et que les motifs de sa décision indiquent clairement pourquoi la demande a été rejetée.
[35]
Sur la question de la vraisemblance, s'appuyant sur
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 1685, le défendeur soutient que le demandeur n'a pas fourni de preuve documentaire indépendante pour dissiper les doutes de la Commission. Il appartient à la Commission d'évaluer la crédibilité de la preuve, notamment en relevant les incompatibilités et les contradictions. De plus, le demandeur n'a pas réfuté la présomption selon laquelle la Commission avait examiné toute la preuve; ses arguments se fondent plutôt sur l'importance accordée à la preuve.
[36]
Sur la question de la PRI, le défendeur se fondant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), est d'accord avec le demandeur pour dire qu'il a deux critères pour établir l'existence d'une PRI. Le défendeur soutient que le risque allégué pour les PRI a été bien évalué et que le demandeur a le lourd fardeau de démontrer que les PRI sont déraisonnables: « Il ne faut rien de moins que l'existence de conditions qui mettraient en péril la vie et la sécurité d'un revendicateur tentant de se relocaliser temporairement en lieu sûr. De plus, il faut une preuve réelle et concrète de l'existence de telles conditions. » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le défendeur soutient que la Commission a tenu compte de l'affirmation du demandeur selon laquelle il serait repéré par la LFM à son retour et qu'elle a conclu qu'il s'agissait d'une hypothèse non étayée par une preuve solide.
VI.
Analyse et décision
A.
Question 1 - Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
[37]
Les deux parties soutiennent que la norme de la décision raisonnable devrait être appliquée. Je suis d'accord. En l'espèce, le contrôle porte sur des questions mixtes de fait et de droit. Lorsque la jurisprudence a déjà établi de façon satisfaisante la norme de contrôle applicable, il n'y a pas lieu de refaire l'analyse (voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 62).
[38]
Il a été établi dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53, que la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique « lorsque le droit et les faits s'entrelacent et ne peuvent aisément être dissociés » (voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 315;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 369, aux paragraphes 22 à 40).
[39]
La norme de la décision raisonnable signifie que la Cour ne doit pas intervenir si la décision de la Commission est transparente, justifiée et intelligible et si elle appartient aux issues acceptables (voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47). En l'espèce, la Cour annulera la décision de la Commission seulement si elle n'arrive pas à comprendre le fondement de ses conclusions ou comment les faits et le droit applicable étayent l'issue (voir
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Comme la Cour suprême l'a affirmé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 59 et 61, lorsqu'une cour applique la norme du caractère raisonnable à une décision, elle ne y peut substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable, ni réévaluer les éléments de preuve.
B.
Question 2 - L'évaluation de la PRI par la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
[40]
Lorsqu'il s'agit de déterminer s'il existe une PRI raisonnable, comme nous l'enseigne l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et nous le confirme
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  prouver: 1) qu'il existe, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, un risque sérieux de persécution partout au pays, y compris dans la région susceptible d'offrir la PRI; 2) que la situation de la PRI proposée doit être telle qu'il serait déraisonnable que le demandeur s'y réfugie, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, notamment sa situation personnelle.
[41]
En l'espèce, je ne suis pas d'accord avec le demandeur pour dire que l'évaluation de la PRI par la Commission était déraisonnable. À mon avis, les arguments du demandeur visent le bien-fondé de l'appréciation de la preuve. Le demandeur soutient que la conclusion de la Commission est déraisonnable parce qu'elle n'a pas tenu compte de la motivation ou d'autres moyens qu'une base de données électronique que la LFM pourrait avoir pour le pourchasser. Il affirme par ailleurs que la Commission n'a pas évalué le caractère raisonnable de la PRI uniquement par rapport aux bonnes perspectives d'emploi et au taux de criminalité plus bas. Le demandeur soutient que la PRI proposée, Mexico, est déraisonnable en raison de la violence très répandue des gangs et d'autres moyens qui pourraient servir à le repérer. En particulier, il a déclaré à l'audience devant la Commission qu'un individu avait tiré des coups de feu en sa direction lors de sa deuxième visite à Mexico.
[42]
Il ressort du raisonnement de la Commission qu'elle a examiné la preuve dont elle disposait, y compris la preuve documentaire et les affirmations du demandeur. La Commission n'est pas tenue de mentionner tous les éléments de preuve dans sa décision (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2004] ACF no 758). Suivant la norme de la décision raisonnable, le rôle de la Cour n'est pas d'apprécier de nouveau la preuve, mais d'évaluer si la décision de la Commission fait partie des issues acceptables. À l'instar du défendeur, j'estime que le demandeur demande à la Cour d'apprécier de nouveau la preuve, ce qui ne fait pas partie de son rôle. En l'espèce, la Commission a en fin de compte jugé que les PRI proposées étaient raisonnables. Pour que sa décision soit raisonnable, la Commission n'a pas à parvenir à la même conclusion que le demandeur.
[43]
De plus, je ne vois aucune raison d'inférer que la Commission a écarté ou mal interprété la preuve. Je suis d'avis que la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle les agents de persécution n'ont pas l'intérêt, la motivation, les moyens ou les ressources nécessaires pour pourchasser le demandeur dans les régions visées par les PRI fait partie des issues acceptables.
C.
Question 3 - L'évaluation de la crainte subjective par la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
[44]
La Commission a fondé son inférence défavorable quant à la crainte subjective sur deux principaux motifs: i) la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile et ii) le fait de se réclamer de nouveau de la protection de l'État. En ce qui a trait à la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile, le demandeur soutient qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de la Commission d'en inférer une absence de crainte subjective. Le demandeur affirme que ce retard était raisonnable compte tenu du fait qu'il avait un visa d'étudiant valide et qu'il s'était ensuite marié et avait fait confiance à son épouse pour la demande de parrainage. Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 16 et 18, la Cour a jugé que le statut temporaire valide d'un demandeur constituait une raison légitime pour ne pas demander l'asile plus tôt:
[16] La jurisprudence montre qu'en général le fait pour un demandeur d'asile de ne pas revendiquer le statut de réfugié dès son arrivée ou dans un délai raisonnable peut constituer un facteur important dans l'appréciation de la crédibilité du revendicateur (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.), mais il est des cas où de telles conclusions défavorables ne peuvent pas être tirées et où la tardiveté du demandeur d'asile à revendiquer le statut de réfugié dès son arrivée dans un pays signataire de la Convention ne peut à elle seule autoriser la Commission à douter de la crédibilité du revendicateur.
[...]
[18] En l'espèce, le demandeur avait un visa d'étudiant et il avait aussi présenté une demande de résidence permanente. Il est clair que ce n'est que le jour où il a perdu le soutien financier qu'il recevait de sa famille au Népal qu'il a craint de devoir retourner dans son pays puisqu'il ne pouvait plus payer ses études. Il y a manifestement un parallèle direct à faire avec le marin travaillant sur le navire, qui finalement reçoit son congé et n'a d'autre endroit où aller que chez lui. Tous deux avaient quitté leur pays par crainte de la persécution et avaient trouvé un endroit sûr où demeurer et travailler, de telle sorte qu'ils ne ressentaient pas le besoin de demander le statut de réfugié puisqu'ils étaient en sécurité pour le moment. Soudainement, tous deux se sont rendu compte qu'ils devaient se préparer à retourner dans leur pays, en raison de circonstances sur lesquelles ils n'avaient aucune prise, et ils ont immédiatement produit une revendication.
[45]
Par ailleurs, la Cour a conclu dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> que l'existence d'un visa d'étudiant valide ne rend pas une inférence défavorable déraisonnable (voir le paragraphe 33 de présents motifs).
[46]
En l'espèce, je suis d'avis que les faits s'apparentent à ceux de l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et je souscris à l'opinion du juge en chef Paul S. Crampton dans cette affaire que l'inférence défavorable de la Commission appartient aux issues acceptables.
[47]
Je vais maintenant analyser le fait de se réclamer à nouveau de la protection de l'État de persécution. Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour a conclu à cet égard qu'agir de la sorte mine l'allégation de crainte subjective du demandeur si ce dernier n'a pas de raisons impérieuses de le faire.
[48]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour a conclu au paragraphe 35, qu'« un séjour temporaire par un réfugié dans le pays où il craint la persécution, alors qu'il n'a pas l'intention d'y établir sa résidence permanente, ne devrait pas impliquer la perte du statut de réfugié ».
[49]
En l'espèce, le demandeur est retourné deux fois au Mexique, les deux fois pour renouveler son visa d'étudiant. Il n'est pas retourné chez lui, dans l'État d'Aguascalientes, et a séjourné temporairement à Mexico pendant un mois seulement chaque fois. À mon avis, ces retours ne démontrent pas qu'il s'est réclamé à nouveau de la protection de son pays de nationalité. Puisque la détermination de la crainte subjective était fondée à la fois sur la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile et sur le fait qu'il s'était réclamé de nouveau de la protection de l'État, je ne peux pas deviner quelle aurait été la décision de la Commission n'eût été cette erreur. Par conséquent, la Commission a commis une erreur à cet égard.
D.
Question 4 - L'évaluation de la vraisemblance par la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
[50]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour a clarifié la distinction entre les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité et la conclusion voulant que la menace posée soit invraisemblable et a déclaré qu'il ne faut conclure à l'invraisemblance que dans les cas les plus évidents.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2004] ACF no 1149, le juge Richard Mosley a expliqué:
[...] les conclusions sur la vraisemblance reposent sur un raisonnement distinct de celui des conclusions sur la crédibilité et peuvent être influencées par des présomptions culturelles ou des perceptions erronées. En conséquence, les conclusions d'invraisemblance doivent être fondées sur une preuve claire et un raisonnement clair à l'appui des déductions de la Commission et devraient faire état des éléments de preuve pertinents qui pourraient réfuter lesdites conclusions.
[51]
La Cour a souligné à nouveau ce principe dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1438.
[52]
En l'espèce, la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible parce que ses explications sur les secrets de la famille concernant les demandes d'extorsion et sur le fait qu'aucun membre de la famille n'a repris l'entreprise familiale après son départ étaient déraisonnables. La Commission a estimé qu'elle ne disposait pas de suffisamment d'éléments de preuve fiables ou dignes de foi pour conclure que le demandeur « craint avec raison d'être persécuté ou qu'il est exposé à un risque crédible de préjudice au Mexique ». Ces hypothèses se rapportent à la dynamique familiale du demandeur, et non à la demande d'asile en cause. Je crois qu'elles ont été influencées par de possibles présomptions culturelles.
[53]
Par conséquent, je ne vois pas de raisonnement clair à l'appui des inférences défavorables de la Commission. Les conclusions relatives à l'invraisemblance ne résistent pas à l'examen fait suivant la norme de la décision raisonnable.
[54]
La Commission a commis des erreurs dans l'appréciation de la crainte subjective et dans ses conclusions relatives à l'invraisemblance, mais ces erreurs ne sont pas déterminantes en l'espèce. J'ai conclu que la décision de la Commission concernant l'existence d'une PRI était une décision raisonnable, ce qui signifie que le demandeur ne craint pas avec raison d'être persécuté dans son pays de nationalité. Pour qu'une demande d'asile soit accueillie, le demandeur doit craindre avec raison d'être persécuté dans son pays de nationalité. Or, il n'a pas cette crainte puisqu'il existe une PRI.
[55]
Par conséquent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée.
[56]
Ni l'une ni l'autre des parties ne souhaite proposer une question grave de portée générale pour examen aux fins de certification.
