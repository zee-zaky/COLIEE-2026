MacKay, J.
: The applicant, Lakbir Singh Brar, applied to be admitted to Canada as a refugee. Before a decision was made he was reported by the respondent Ministers to the Security Intelligence Review Committee for investigation and report about his security status in accord with then s. 39(2) of the Immigration Act, 1976 (S.C. 1976-77, c. 52, as amended, now Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 as amended). The applicant seeks interlocutory and interim orders restraining the Committee from further investigation of the matter, pending trial of an action in which it is claimed that procedures of the Committee violate rights assured to the applicant under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in particular ss. 7, 11 and 14. The procedures of the Committee are also said to violate principles of natural justice and fairness applicable to its processes of investigation under administrative law principles.
[2]
Two main issues arise in this application: first, the authority of the court in relation to proceedings arising from the Immigration Act in light of amendments adopted in 1988 and in force shortly before this action and this motion were filed; and second, the role of the court in considering interlocutory relief where Charter rights and administrative law principles are alleged to be violated by procedures adopted by an agency of government operating under enabling legislation which legislation is not characterized as contravening the Charter. Following argument on these issues my decision was reserved and counsel for the applicant then moved orally, in furtherance of the relief sought in the action already commenced, for an interim injunction restraining further proceedings of the Committee, pending a decision on the motion for an interlocutory injunction. After hearing counsel the oral motion was dismissed from the bench for reasons that are set out near the end of this statement of reasons which is concerned primarily with the main issues.
[3]
The action initiated on February 24, 1989, sought the following relief:
(a) an interim injunction to enjoin the Committee from resuming its investigation of the plaintiff, applicant herein, on February 27, 1989 (relief considered moot at the commencement of the hearing April 14, 1989, because of the passage of time but which relief, as noted, was again requested by an oral motion the effect of which would be to stay further proceedings of the Committee pending disposition of the application for an interlocutory injunction);
(b) an interlocutory injunction pending trial of the action;
(c) a writ of prohibition against defendants, respondents herein, until the procedures for receiving evidence by the Committee are amended to comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and
(d) a writ of mandamus requiring the Committee to reveal the evidence against the applicant which it has heard or received to date, if necessary without revealing the source.
[4]
On the same day as the statement of claim was filed, notice of motion was filed that application would be made for the interim and interlocutory injunctions noted above. That application was heard by my brother Teitelbaum, J., on February 28, 1989, when, with necessary documents still outstanding, at the applicant's request the matter was adjourned sine die. It was renewed on April 3, 1989, and again adjourned sine die because of inadequate notice in service upon the respondents, and it was finally heard on April 14 and 17, 1989.
[5]
In these proceedings counsel for the applicant was heard, as was counsel for the Attorney General of Canada representing both the Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of Employment and Immigration as well as the Director of C.S.I.S., and counsel for the Chairman of the Security Intelligence Review Committee also participated in the hearing.
The Background
[6]
The applicant, a native of India whose passport has been revoked by that country, entered Canada in April 1985 as a visitor, a status which was extended to June 30, 1985. Thereafter he has remained in Canada without authorization or status under the Immigration Act, 1976 and its successor. In late 1985 and early 1986 he made application to remain in Canada as a permanent resident but each time the application was refused. In May 1986 he applied again under the administrative review programme then recently announced and made known his intentions to claim convention refugee status as provided in the Act. He was interviewed under this programme but no decision was made apparently because his security clearance was outstanding.
[7]
By registered letter of June 23, 1987, the applicant was advised by the Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister for Employment and Immigration that on June 18, 1987, they had made a report to the Security and Intelligence Review Committee because of their opinion that he is a person described in s. 19(1)(e) of the Immigration Act, 1976. The letter also advised, pursuant to s. 39(2) of the Immigration Act, that following an investigation a deportation order might be made against him, and that it was expected the Review Committee would be providing further information in due course.
[8]
By letter of July 13, 1987, to the Solicitor General the applicant objected to the decision of the Ministers and in reply by letter of August 6, 1987, the Minister advised:
"The matter is now in the hands of the Security Intelligence Review Committee who should be sending to you shortly, a statement summarizing such information available to it as will enable you to be as fully informed as possible of the circumstances giving rise to the action my colleague and I have taken. I anticipate that this statement will provide you with the information you require prior to any hearing the Committee may order."
[9]
A year later on August 7, 1988, counsel representing the applicant wrote to the Chairman of the Committee advising that he was representing the applicant; that it was of importance that the applicant have a full opportunity to know allegations that may be made against him and to defend or rebut those and an opportunity to appear before the Committee at an oral hearing once he had received information from the Committee. On August 11, 1987, the Executive Secretary of the Committee wrote, on behalf of the Chairman, to the applicant advising that the Committee had received a joint report from the two ministers in which was expressed the opinion that the applicant was an inadmissible person as described in ss. 19(1)(e) and (f) of the Immigration Act, 1976, that the Committee "will conduct an investigation and pursuant to s. 46 of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act (then S.C. 1983-84, c. 21 as amended, now R.S.C. 1985, c. C-23, as amended) a Statement of Circumstances will be forwarded to you as soon as possible". There was further correspondence between counsel for the applicant and the Committee, including a letter from the Executive Secretary, dated August 21, 1987, confirming that his office would keep counsel informed as the Committee's investigation proceeded and that the applicant herein would have the right and opportunity to be heard at an appropriate time during the investigation.
[10]
More than a year later the applicant received a "Statement of Circumstances giving rise to the making of a report by the Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of Employment and Immigration to the Security Intelligence Review Committee", dated October 20, 1988. That statement was subsequently modified by change of one word and a revised statement of circumstances dated December 19, 1988, was provided to the applicant. The revision in the statement is not of significance in this application.
[11]
On December 19, 1988, counsel representing the Ministers and the Canadian Intelligence Security Service together with a representative of the Committee met with counsel for the applicant who were advised of the processes followed by the Committee, in accord with its rules and the C.S.I.S. Act. The Committee's rules of procedure were provided to the applicant's counsel and advice was given to them that
(a) further particulars, beyond those provided in the Statement of Circumstances would not be provided to the applicant before any hearings;
(b) the Committee would receive information in closed session from which the applicant and his counsel would be excluded, and evidence taken at these closed sessions, to the extent it could be released in light of the Committee's responsibilities for security matters as set out in the C.S.I.S. Act, would be released to him after any necessary editing by the Committee in consultation with its counsel and the Director of C.S.I.S.;
(c) arrangements for hearing the applicant would be made, and initial dates for hearings of the Committee were established in light of the availability of the applicant and his counsel; and
(d) as counsel for the applicant requested, some assurances were given by counsel for the Ministers and C.S.I.S. to provide notes made by C.S.I.S. officers of previous interviews with the applicant, and similar information recorded by representatives of the R.C.M.P. was requested and undertakings given that best efforts would be made to arrange for that.
[12]
Committee hearings commenced on January 18 and 19. They were resumed on February 27 and 28, on April 3 and at least two further days of hearings on April 18 and 19 were scheduled when this notice for an interlocutory injunction was heard. In part these hearings were conducted in closed session without the applicant or his counsel present and on February 8 a summary was provided to the applicant of evidence heard in this form of closed session on January 18 and 19 so far as the Committee, upon consultation and advice, considered it could be released. In addition, through the course of the Committee's dealings with him, the applicant was provided with certain materials that had been provided to the Committee. These included notes from C.S.I.S. records of two previous interviews of Brar by C.S.I.S. officers, notes of one R.C.M.P. officer's interview of the applicant, and notes of an interview of another person by R.C.M.P. officers conducted in India early in 1988, some months after the Ministers concerned had made their report to the Committee, and finally, the applicant was provided with "open sources" of information provided to the Committee by C.S.I.S. The last of these items consisted of magazine and newspaper articles or other similar source material, already in the public forum, which related in the main to activities of Sikh organizations in Canada and elsewhere with little or no direct reference to the applicant, as was admitted in cross-examination of C.S. I.S. staff responsible for compiling the information.
[13]
One aspect of the Committee's proceedings in this case was to permit cross-examination by counsel for the applicant of some of the witnesses originally heard in closed session in the absence of the applicant and his counsel. Another was to permit the applicant himself to be heard and to call witnesses in support of his position. In addition to services of an interpreter retained by the Committee for purposes of translation of testimony given by Brar or other witnesses in Punjabi, he was permitted to have his own interpreter present with him when he was permitted to attend sessions of the Committee. In addition, when first appearing on January 18 before the Committee, the applicant's counsel was heard in relation to submissions about clarification of the Committee's function with a view to understanding the case the applicant should expect to meet, about counsel's concerns regarding procedures of the Committee and also relating to perceived infringements of the applicant's rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[14]
Various processes of the Committee in its dealings with the applicant were differently perceived by counsel for the applicant and counsel for the respondents. Thus, there are differences whether or not undertakings about release of notes of interviews of the applicant by representatives of C.S. I.S. and the R.C.M.P. were fulfilled, for the applicant recalls more interviews with notes being taken than the records produced to him would indicate. There were differences about the effect of the arrangements made for translation and the impact of these upon the applicant's position. There were differences also in perception of the role of the Committee, and actions of the designated member, in this case the Chairman, responsible for the investigation, and in perceptions of the role of counsel to the Committee in relation to the interests of the public and of the applicant in the course of considering evidence adduced during closed hearings when the applicant and his counsel were excluded. All such differences, no doubt of very real concern to the applicant and also to the respondents, arise in regard to the issue of whether in this application there has been made out a prima facie case or a serious question to be dealt with at trial which would warrant further consideration of the application for an interlocutory injunction. None of these differences need to be resolved in this application.
[15]
Before turning to issues and argument concerning the merits of this application, it is necessary to deal with questions raised about procedures followed by the applicant in this case which it was submitted affect the jurisdiction of the court, in light of recent amendments to the Immigration Act.
The Court's Jurisdiction
[16]
Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada, representing the Ministers and the Director C.S.I.S. submitted that the motion of the applicant should be dismissed in view of ss. 50 and 83.1 of the Immigration Act (as enacted S.C. 1988, c. 35 and proclaimed in force on January 1, 1989 by SI/88-231 dated December 7, 1988 - now ss. 50 and 82.1 of the same Act as amended by c. 28 (4th Supp.)) and the failure of the applicant to make formal application by motion in order to seek leave to commence this proceeding.
[17]
The statutory provisions referred to were enacted as part of a new regulatory regime for dealing with claims to refugee status, effective January 1, 1989. Those provisions currently read:
"50. Section 82.1 of the said Act applies in respect of any application or other proceeding commenced under section 18 or 28 of the Federal Court Act on or after the commencement day with respect to any decision or order made, or other matter arising, under the former Act or the rules or regulations thereunder before the commencement day.
"82.1(1) An application or other proceeding may be commenced under section 18 or 28 of the Federal Court Act with respect to any decision or order made, or any other matter arising, under this Act or the rules or regulations only with leave of a judge of the Federal Court - Trial Division or the Federal Court of Appeal, as the case may be.
. . . . .
"82.1(3) An application under this section for leave to commence a proceeding shall be filed with the appropriate Court within fifteen days after the day on which the applicant is notified of the decision or order or becomes aware of the other matter.
"82.1(4) Unless a judge of the appropriate Court directs otherwise, an application under this section for leave to commence a proceeding shall be disposed of without personal appearance.
"82.1(5) Where leave under this section to commence a proceeding is granted, the proceeding shall be commenced within fifteen days after the granting of leave.
"82.1(6) A judge of the appropriate Court may, for special reasons, allow an extended time for filing an application under this section for leave to commence a proceeding or for commencing the proceeding."
[18]
Counsel for the applicant contended that in preparation for initiating the action and this motion there were consultations with the Registry of the Court in Toronto which in turn had consulted the Office of the Associate Chief Justice, and it was counsel's understanding that the amending legislation of 1988 would not apply to this matter or in the alternative if leave were required, that was implicitly granted without formal application when a date was set for this proceeding. Counsel further pointed out that the Crown's submission that procedural deficiency resulted in a lack of jurisdiction had not been raised by the respondents when the matter was first raised before my colleague Teitelbaum, J., on February 28 or when it was again brought forward on April 3.
[19]
It is my conclusion that s. 50 of the Immigration Act does apply to this matter which is "an application or other proceeding commenced under section 18 ... of the Federal Court Act on or after the commencement day with respect to any decision or order made, or other matter arising, under the former Act ..." (i.e., the Immigration Act before proclamation of the 1988 amendment S.C. 1988, c. 35).
[20]
That being the case, s. 82.1 requires leave to bring this motion and to initiate the action herein. I do not consider informal advice through the Registry in the absence of a formal motion for leave as implying that leave is, or was, granted. In the circumstances of this case, however, I am prepared to consider that leave was implicitly sought when this matter was heard. The proceedings take place in a time of transition in the applicable legislative regime [see footnote 1]. The merits have been fully and ably argued at least in relation to interlocutory and interim orders here sought and having carefully considered those arguments I am prepared to dispose of them. For these reasons, assuming leave needs be explicitly granted, I hereby grant leave for these proceedings.
[21]
In cases involving applications for leave to proceed under s. 82.1 of the Immigration Act, the test has been whether the application raises a serious issue to be heard. Where that was found, leave was granted in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C. T.D.). Where no serious issue with no possibility for success in a hearing or in an action was found, leave was denied in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Jerome, A.C.J., at pp. 4-5 (F.C.T.D.)), and in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 2 (F.C.T.D.)). In considering the merits of this application for injunctive relief I have, as indicated in the reasons that follow, found that there are serious issues to be heard in the action initiated here. Thus the standard for granting leave to consider this application is met.
[22]
Counsel for the respondent the Chairman of S.I.R.C. submitted that if leave were considered granted, then the time limits established by s. 82.1(3) of the Immigration Act ought to apply and in this case, the applicant had not applied "within fifteen days after the day on which the applicant is notified of the decision or becomes aware of the other matter". Here the applicant's concerns are with the ongoing process of S.I.R.C., not with any singular or particular decision, but with procedures which have become apparent as the process of the Committee continues. In these circumstances it is unnecessary to fix a specific start date for the fifteen day limitation period to commence. For this reason, and because of the particular circumstances of this case referred to earlier in considering the matter of leave, it seems to me entirely appropriate, if that be necessary, to extend the time for commencing this proceeding pursuant to s. 82.1(6) of the Act, to the date on which the matter was heard.
The Legislative Regime
[23]
When this matter first became of concern to the applicant following receipt of the letter of June 23, 1987, the Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of Employment and Immigration who sent that letter, had acted under the then s. 39 of the Immigration Act, 1976 as enacted by S.C. 1983-84, c. 21, s. 80 [see footnote 2], which provided (in paragraphs relevant to this proceeding):
"39(1) In this section and section 40, 'Review Committee' has the meaning assigned to that expression by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act.
"39(2) Where the Minister and the Solicitor General are of the opinion, based on security or criminal intelligence reports received and considered by them, that a person, other than a Canadian citizen, is
(a) in the case of a permanent resident, a person described in subparagraph 19(1)(d)(ii) or paragraph 19(1)(e) or (g) or 27(1)(c), or
(b) in any other case, a person described in any of paragraphs 19(1)(d) to (g) or 27(2)(c),
they may make a report to the Review Committee and shall, within ten days after the report is made, cause a notice to be sent informing the person that following an investigation in relation thereto, a deportation order may be made against that person.
. . . . .
"39(5) The Review Committee shall, as soon as practicable after a report is made to it pursuant to subsection (2), send to the person with respect to whom the report is made a statement summarizing such information available to it as will enable the person to be as fully informed as possible of the circumstances giving rise to the report.
. . . . .
"39(8) The Review Committee shall,
(a) on completion of an investigation in relation to a report made to it pursuant to subsection (2), make a report to the Governor-in-Council containing its conclusion whether or not a certificate should be issued under subsection 40(1) and the grounds on which that conclusion is based; and
(b) at the same time as or after a report is made pursuant to paragraph (a), provide the person with respect to whom the report is made with a report containing the conclusion referred to in that paragraph."
[24]
When S.I.R.C. has reported to the Governor-in-Council following its investigation, s. 40 of the Immigration Act, 1976 as it then was (by virtue of S.C. 1983-84, c. 21, s. 80) provided:
"40(1) Where, after considering a report made by the Review Committee referred to in paragraph 39(8)(a), the Governor-in-Council is satisfied that the person with respect to whom the report was made is
(a) in the case of a permanent resident, a person described in subparagraph 19(1)(d)(ii) or paragraph 19(1)(e) or (g) or 27(1)(c), or
(b) in any other case, a person described in any of paragraphs 19(1)(d) to (g) or 27(2)(c),
the Governor-in-Council may direct the Minister to issue a certificate to that effect.
"40(2) A certificate issued under subsection (1) is, in any prosecution or other proceeding under or arising out of this Act, conclusive proof of the matters stated therein without proof of the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed the certificate unless called into question by the Minister."
[25]
The Immigration Act, 1976 provided, as current legislation does, for proceedings by way of inquiry concerning immigration status where the certificate is taken into account and departmental officers may order deportation. Formerly the Act provided, following a deportation order, for an appeal (S.C. 1983-84, c. 21, s. 81), on a question of law or fact, or mixed law and fact, but since amendments of 1988 (An Act to Amend the Immigration Act, 1976 and the Criminal Code in consequence thereof, S.C. 1988, c. 36, s. 5) the opportunity to appeal to an Immigration Board may be withdrawn in certain cases "if the Minister is of the opinion that [an appeal] would be contrary to the public interest".
[26]
Certain sections of the Immigration Act, 1976 relevant here specify grounds that may be of concern to the Ministers in relation to security matters. Among these set out in s. 19(1) of the Act which deals with persons not admissible to Canada are two referred to in letters sent to the applicant, specifically:
"(e) persons who have engaged in or who there are reasonable grounds to believe will engage in acts of espionage or subversion against democratic government, institutions or processes, as they are understood in Canada, except persons who, having engaged in such acts, have satisfied the Minister that their admission would not be detrimental to the national interest;
"(f) persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe will, while in Canada, engage in or instigate the subversion by force of any government."
Section 27 of the Act provides for a report to be made, leading to an inquiry and possible deportation of persons, other than Canadian citizens, after their admission to Canada, including a permanent resident (under s. 27(1)) or a person other than a Canadian citizen or permanent resident (under s. 27(2)) "who is engaged in or instigating subversion by force of any government" (see: Immigration Act, 1976, S.C. 1976-77, c. 52, s. 27(1) and (2), now Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended, s. 27(1) and (2)).
[27]
As noted earlier, in this case the respondent Ministers, acting under s. 39(2) of the Immigration Act, 1976 as it then was, reported their opinion to the S.I.R.C. by letter of June 18, 1987, and five days later reported to the applicant that they had made a report to S.I.R.C. and that following an investigation of the matter by the Committee, a deportation order may be made against him.
[28]
The Security Intelligence Review Committee, constituted under the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, is unusual in its advisory role and its composition. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, enacted following reports of two Royal Commissions and consideration in Parliament, provided for creation of a civilian security intelligence service presided over by a Director operating under direction of the Solicitor General. Among significant provisions for oversight of the agency's operations, the Act provides for creation of the Security Intelligence Review Committee to be composed of a chairman and two to four others appointed by the Governor-in-Council from among persons who also hold appointment as members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, who are not Members of the Senate or the House of Commons, after consultation by the Prime Minister with the Leader of the Opposition, and the leader of any other party represented by 12 or more Members in the House of Commons. Members of the Committee are required to comply with all security requirements of the Service and to take a statutory oath of secrecy (C.S.I.S. Act, ss. 34, 37).
[29]
The role of the Committee is set out in s. 38 of the C.S.I.S. Act:
"38. The functions of the Review Committee are
(a) to review generally the performance by the Service of its duties and functions and, in connection therewith,
(i) to review the reports of the Director and certificates of the Inspector General transmitted to it pursuant to subsection 33(3),
(ii) to review directions issued by the Minister under subsection 6(2),
(iii) to review arrangements entered into by the Service pursuant to subsections 13(2) and (3) and 17(1) and to monitor the provision of information and intelligence pursuant to those arrangements,
(iv) to review any report or comment given to it pursuant to subsection 20(4),
(v) to monitor any request referred to in paragraph 16(3)(a) made to the Service,
(vi) to review the regulations, and
(vii) to compile and analyse statistics on the operational activities of the Service;
(b) to arrange for reviews to be conducted, or to conduct reviews, pursuant to section 40; and
(c) to conduct investigations in relation to
(i) complaints made to the Committee under sections 41 and 42 of this Act,
(ii) reports made to the Committee pursuant to section 17.1 of the Citizenship Act or sections 39 and 82.1 of the Immigration Act, 1976, and
(iii) matters referred to the Committee pursuant to section 36.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act."
This section provides the basis for S.I.R.C.'s important role not only in particular investigations, as in this case under s. 38(c)(ii), but also in annual and special reviews of the activities and policies of the C.S.I.S.
[30]
In discharge of its functions the Review Committee's procedures have been set out in part in the C.S.I.S. Act, and some of those relating to complaints concerning the denial of security clearance and reporting are specifically made applicable, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to an investigation under s. 39 of the Immigration Act, 1976 by virtue of s. 39(5) of the latter Act (as enacted S.C. 1983-84, c. 21, s. 80). Those provisions of interest in this case include the following portions of the C.S.I.S. Act:
"39(1) Subject to this Act, the Review Committee may determine the procedure to be followed in the performance of any of its duties or functions.
. . . . .
"43. A member of the Review Committee may exercise any of the powers or perform any of the duties or functions of the Committee under this Part in relation to complaints.
. . . . .
"46. The review Committee shall, as soon as practicable after receiving a complaint ... send to the complainant a statement summarizing such information available to the Committee as will enable the complainant to be as fully informed as possible of the circumstances giving rise to the denial of the security clearance and shall send a copy of the statement to the Director and the deputy head concerned.
. . . . .
"48(1) Every investigation of a complaint under this Part by the Review Committee shall be conducted in private.
"48(2) In the course of an investigation of a complaint under this Part by the Review Committee, the complainant, deputy head concerned and the Director shall be given an opportunity to make representations to the Review Committee, to present evidence and to be heard personally or by counsel, but no one is entitled as of right to be present during, to have access to or to comment on representations made to the Review Committee by any other person.
. . . . .
"50. The Review Committee has, in relation to the investigation of any complaint under this Part, power
(a) to summon and enforce the appearance of persons before the Committee and to compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce such documents and things as the Committee deems requisite to the full investigation and consideration of the complaint in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record;
(b) to administer oaths; and
(c) to receive and accept such evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, as the Committee sees fit, whether or not such evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law."
Other provisions of the C.S.I.S. Act relating to S.I.R.C.'s investigation of complaints provide for full access to information by S.I.R.C. (s. 39(2), (3)), for reporting S.I.R.C. to the Minister and a complainant or person investigated (ss. 52, 54) and for consultation by S.I.R.C. with the Director, C.S.I.S. before sending any statement of circumstances or report in order to ensure S.I.R.C. itself does not breach national security interests (s. 55).
[31]
Under the Act the S.I.R.C. has established procedural rules the most significant of which for purposes of this application include the following:
"33. Upon receipt of a report under 39(2) of the Immigration Act, the Chairman shall assign one or more members of the Committee to investigate the grounds on which the report is based.
. . . . .
"35. The Executive Secretary on behalf of the assigned members shall obtain from the Minister and the Solicitor-General information upon which they based their opinion that the person is one described in paragraphs 39(2)(a) or (b) of the Immigration Act.
"36. Upon receipt of the information referred to in Rule 35, the assigned members shall, after consulting with the Director pursuant to paragraph 55(a) of the Act, instruct the Executive Secretary on their behalf to send the statement referred to in subsection 39(5) of the Immigration Act by registered mail or personal service and instruct the Executive Secretary on their behalf to advise by registered mail or personal service the person, the Minister, Solicitor-General and the Director of their opportunity to make representations under subsection 48(2) of the Act, of the time limits they have established within which those representations must be made and advise them of the procedures for the making of representations as set out in Rules 45 through 51.
. . . . .
"38.... the Committee shall make a report to the Governor-in-Council as required by paragraph 39(8)(a) of the Immigration Act and shall consult with the Director pursuant to section 55 of the Act prior to providing by registered mail or personal service the person with respect to whom the report is made with a report containing the conclusion of the said report to the Governor-in-Council, pursuant to paragraph 39(8)(b) of the Immigration Act.
. . . . .
"45. The Executive Secretary on behalf of the members assigned to conduct the investigation shall by registered mail or personal service advise the person affected
(1) of the requirements of section 48 of the Act;
(2) of his right to an oral hearing with or without representation in writing to the assigned members; and
(3) that if he does not exercise his right to an oral hearing, he may make representations in writing to the assigned members.
. . . . .
"47. If the person affected requests an oral hearing, the Executive Secretary on behalf of the assigned members shall be registered mail or personal service forward to the parties a notice of hearing setting out the time and place of the hearing and stating that if the party notified does not attend the hearing, the assigned members may proceed in his absence.
"48(1) A party to an oral hearing may:
(a) be represented by counsel;
(b) call and examine witnesses and make representations.

[32]
As noted earlier, the Immigration Act provides for S.I.R.C. to report its conclusion following an investigation under s. 39. Any action taken following such a report is then taken by the Minister under the Immigration Act as directed by the Governor-in-Council.
The Claim For Injunctive Relief
[33]
The application for an interlocutory injunction, and the action for prohibition and mandamus in addition to injunctive relief, are based on the applicant's claim that the Committee's procedures deny rights assured by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and they are also said not to meet standards of fairness applicable under law to this Committee's investigation of the applicant. There is no claim that the statutes here violate the Charter or are otherwise beyond the power of Parliament. The remedies sought, if granted, would stay proceedings before the Committee until the procedures alleged to be unlawful are made consistent with provisions of the Charter and applicable principles of fairness, and would compel release of information or evidence already received by the Committee, if necessary without revealing the source.
[34]
In essence counsel for all the parties rely upon the criteria for a claim to injunctive relief or a stay of proceedings as set out by Beetz, J., for the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Man.R.(2d) 241; 18 C.P.C.(2d) 273, at pp. 126-150 S.C.R. The criteria there recognized as applicable in a constitutional case, which I consider this to be in light of the issues it raises, may be summarized as:
"(1) whether at the interlocutory stage, before trial of the issues, the case raises a serious question to be tried as opposed to a frivolous or vexatious claim;
"(2) whether the applicant seeking an interlocutory injunction 'would, unless the injunction is granted, suffer irreparable harm, that is harm not susceptible or difficult to be compensated in damages' (at p. 128), and
"(3) whether the balance of convenience favours the granting or refusal of an injunction in light of a determination of which of the two parties will suffer the greater harm from the granting or refusal of the relief sought, pending a decision on the merits. In constitutional cases consideration of the public interest is essential in evaluating the balance of convenience."
[35]
In turning to consideration of the issues raised in this application in relation to these criteria a summary of my conclusions may set the background for discussion in some detail of the issues and arguments material to these conclusions. Other issues are referred to but are discussed more summarily. My basic conclusions are:
(1) The applicant raises serious issues to be tried, in relation to alleged violations of principles of fairness properly applicable to the inquiry by S.I.R.C. acting under s. 39 of the Immigration Act, 1976, but not on the basis of evidence adduced at this stage in relation to rights assured by the Charter.
(2) The applicant has not persuaded me of the likelihood of irreparable harm to him from the inquiry by S.I.R.C. itself if the relief here sought is not granted.
(3) In any event, the balance of convenience, taking the public interest into consideration, favours not granting an interlocutory injunction in this case.
Is There A Serious Issue To Be Tried?
[36]
The applicant alleges, through affidavit and in submissions by counsel, a number of specific concerns about the procedures followed by the Committee in its investigation, and respondents reply to these in some detail by affidavit of the Executive Secretary, S.I.R.C. and by submissions of counsel. Only by a trial would the factual basis of these allegations be established.
[37]
The first concerns of the applicant involve Charter arguments, alleged infringements or violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the competence of S.I.R.C. to determine issues raised about the application of the Charter to its own proceedings. The second concern involves a number of incidents and aspects of the Committee's processes which are said to violate principles of natural justice or fairness applicable under the law. In relation to Charter arguments counsel for the applicant cited a number of recent articles or other study papers [see footnote 3].
[38]
Perhaps I can deal briefly with submissions on behalf of the applicant that S.I.R.C. was not competent to deal with Charter issues even though raised by the applicant. This may now be argued because the Chairman of S.I.R.C. in conducting the hearing responded to initial submissions for Brar, that procedures infringed Charter rights, by stating that if there were any infringements these were saved by the justification provided by s. 1 of the Charter. In so ruling the Chairman had not called upon the respondents to justify any alleged infringements on the basis of s. 1, though jurisprudence would indicate that the burden is theirs if there is dispute.
[39]
There are cases that support the submission of the applicant, based upon s. 24 of the Charter. But cases of authority in this court are otherwise, and I conclude that S.I.R.C., as any other body with which legal and Charter issues are raised, has a responsibility under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 to apply the law and to avoid application of a law that infringes the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) (leave to appeal to the S.C.C. granted June 8, 1989, Supreme Court file no. 21222);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).)
[40]
To deal then with alleged infringements of the Charter, I note that while some other issues were raised in submissions made to the Committee itself and in the written memorandum of fact and law prepared on behalf of the applicant, in argument at the hearing of this matter counsel for the applicant dealt with alleged infringements of ss. 7, 11 and 14. A summary of facts alleged and arguments of the respective parties in relation to these sections of the Charter, in reverse order, follows.
[41]
Section 14 guarantees the right to assistance of an interpreter to "a party or witness in any proceedings who does not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted ..." On behalf of the applicant it is said that S.I.R.C. did not properly address the question of interpretation. Counsel for the Chairman S.I.R.C., conducting the inquiry, submits that the applicant had his own interpreter at his side when he was in attendance at the hearing and in addition, a court interpreter was present and used for purposes of the Committee when the applicant or witnesses on his behalf testified in Punjabi. S.I.R.C.'s own Rules of Procedure, s. 51, provide that "at an oral hearing any person affected who is not fluent in either official language shall be provided upon request with an interpreter". On behalf of the Chairman it is submitted that the process of the Committee in this case was consistent with S.I.R.C.'s own rule and with Charter requirements. Counsel for the Ministers and the Director, C.S.I.S., pointed to some evidence from an R.C.M.P. witness who had earlier interviewed the applicant, that Brar had some capacity to understand and to communicate in English but I am not satisfied there was sufficient inquiry by the Committee itself about his fluency "in either official language", as the Committee's own Rules stipulate, to now suggest that an interpreter's assistance was unnecessary. Indeed, the Chairman in conducting the enquiry seems to have made efforts to meet both the requirements of S.I.R.C.'s own rule and the expressed request of the applicant that, in addition to an official interpreter retained by the Committee for purposes of the hearings, his own personal interpreter also be permitted to accompany him to keep him informed of the proceedings as they progressed.
[42]
The applicant's dissatisfaction with these arrangements appears to have risen from the role played by translators, in particular from the Chairman's unwillingness to accept a suggestion implied from a request by counsel for the applicant, but not directly proposed, that the proceedings progress at a slow enough pace to permit the interpreter to convey a verbatim translation of everything said, whether or not it was directed to the applicant or his counsel or was relevant directly for purposes of his testimony. There was no concern expressed about the role of the translators in dealing with testimony offered by the applicant or witnesses on his behalf in the Punjabi language.
[43]
Obviously, the requirements for translation services in hearings before tribunals, as before the courts, will vary with the case and the circumstances of any hearing. I have no doubt that s. 14 of the Charter is applicable to hearings of this nature conducted by  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 30 C.R.R. 181 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 415; 62 O.R.(2d) 365 (C.A.).) It seems to me that in this case the Chairman, in the conduct of the inquiry, made reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of the Committee's own rule and of the Charter. I am not persuaded that this submission raises a serious issue to be tried.
[44]
Section 11 of the Charter guarantees to any person "charged with an offence" procedural protections under the law in the following terms, (as these are raised by the applicant),
"(a) to be informed without unreasonable delay of the specific offence;
"(b) to be tried within a reasonable time;
"(c) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal."
On behalf of the applicant, aspects of the procedures of S.I.R.C. are said to infringe these Charter guarantees: the lack of clarity about the section or sections of the Immigration Act, 1976 which is the basis of the S.I.R.C. inquiry; the delay in providing any information to the applicant following advice to him by letter of June 23, 1987, i.e., 16 months from that letter to the first statement of circumstances which then provided little information on which the applicant could prepare to respond; the receipt by the Committee of records of interviews conducted in 1988, months after the report of the Ministers, and in circumstances where statements about the applicant were provided to the Committee without possibility of the applicant testing those statements by cross-examination; the role of the Director, C.S.I.S. in relation to the inquiry process; and the general procedures of the Committee in conducting hearings in private without Brar or his counsel present, all of which, it was submitted, left serious questions about S.I.R.C.'s independence and impartiality.
[45]
Considering the decisions of the Supreme Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Sask.R. 105; 24 O.A.C. 321; 45 D.L.R.(4th) 235 (especially per Wilson, J., at pp. 554-560 S.C.R. and pp. 247-251 D.L.R.) and of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), it is my view that an inquiry of the nature here conducted by S.I.R.C. is not subject to the application of s. 11 of the Charter since the applicant here cannot be said to be "charged with an offence". Thus, I am not persuaded that submissions in relation to s. 11 of the Charter raise serious issues to be tried in the circumstances of this case.
[46]
The third Charter argument raised by the applicant is that the process of the Committee infringes s. 7 of the Charter. That section provides:
"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
This argument relating to principles of fundamental justice has essentially the same factual basis as the second major concern of the applicant, that certain of the Committee's procedures violate principles of fairness applicable under law to its operations. The basic allegations of fact relied upon for the two arguments on behalf of the applicant include those set out earlier in relation to ss. 11 and 14 of the Charter and additional allegations.
[47]
Included among these are the imprecision of the statement of circumstances, revealing no offence under Canadian law and providing no clarity of the case the applicant is expected to answer, a lack of precision compounded by differing advice about the statutory basis of the Minister's judgment and thus of the basis of S.I.R.C.'s inquiry. There is as well the delay in providing any information, even the imprecise statement of circumstances, to the applicant; the alleged failure of counsel to meet undertakings to provide copies of records of interviews of Brar, an allegation refuted; the manner in which Charter arguments raised on behalf of the applicant were dealt with by the Chairman of S.I.R.C. rejecting all submissions; the perception that a 1988 interview by R.C.M.P. officers in India resulted from an effort to obtain evidence or reports unfavourable to the applicant long after the Minister's opinions had been formed as though to support their opinion ex post facto; the nature of "evidence" presented to S.I.R.C. particularly the so-called "open sources" of information; the conduct of hearings concerning the applicant which were closed in large part to him and to his counsel; and an incident, disputed, which was said to reflect lack of concern or attention by the Chairman conducting the investigation to the legitimate interests of Brar.
[48]
Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada submits that S.I.R.C. in its investigative and reporting role under s. 39 of the Immigration Act is exercising administrative functions only, without effect upon the rights and obligations of the applicant. Further, it is submitted that S.I.R.C. did not infringe any Charter right in receiving evidence on an in camera basis, when it was satisfied that the restriction on disclosure was necessary for the public interest in national security, national defence or international relations, an interest long recognized in the common law and not reduced by the enactment of the Charter. Recent authorities cited in support of these submissions included  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 385 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.)) for these assume that the Committee's report will be adverse to the applicant in its conclusions and recommendations and that any report of the Committee will lead directly to action adverse to Brar's interests, action which can only be authorized by the Governor General-in-Council. At the time of the hearing in this matter the Committee's work was unfinished and there was no basis to presume a particular outcome from its work.
[50]
The allegations and argument on behalf of the applicant, some disputed and others responded to, do not persuade me that there are serious issues to be tried in relation to alleged infringement of rights secured by s. 7 of the Charter. Hearings of the Committee, even in special inquiries like that involving Brar, in my view, do not deprive the person who is the subject of the inquiry of the rights assured by s. 7. The Committee's function is to investigate and make a report. At most that process can only have an indirect part, if action be taken that reflects any conclusion of the Committee, upon Brar's right to life, liberty and security of the person, the basic rights assured by s. 7.
[51]
While Charter rights here argued in relation to ss. 7, 11 and 14 do not, in my view, meet the threshold test for an interlocutory injunction, I have come to the conclusion that the arguments concerning infringement of principles of law relating to fairness in proceedings of S.I.R.C. do raise serious issues to be tried. Counsel for the respondents submit that as S.I.R.C. is engaged in investigative and reporting procedures in advising the Governor General-in-Council, its operations are not subject to particular principles of fairness, in deed, no hearing, no crossexamination of witnesses, no full disclosure of evidence is required by law. My conclusion is otherwise in relation to those aspects of S.I.R.C.'s work involving investigation of individuals as provided under s. 39 of the Immigration Act. The principle of fairness in procedures, even those characterized as administrative, is well-established, as recognized by the Supreme Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 671, and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 385; 13 C.R.(3d) 1; 50 C.C.C.(2d) 353. Indeed, the Committee itself appears to have recognized its responsibilities in this regard when one considers the procedures it has adopted with the very objective of ensuring fairness to individuals in a manner consistent with the Committee's responsibilities to carefully weigh the public interest in national security and the public interests in full disclosure and protection of individual interests.
[52]
It is my view that various of the concerns of Brar about the procedures of S.I.R.C. and their compatability with the Committee's duty of fairness do raise serious issues to be tried. On this ground the applicant has persuaded me that he has met the threshold test. Of course this does not mean that I am persuaded the procedures adopted and followed by S.I.R.C. do breach principles of fairness applicable to the Committee's operations, that is the serious issue yet to be tried. If the primary relief sought in this application, an interlocutory injunction, is to be granted, the applicant must also persuade the court that irreparable harm will be caused to him if the relief not be granted and that the balance of convenience as between the parties favours the award. As indicated earlier, I have not been so persuaded, for the reasons that follow.
Is Irreparable Harm To Be Anticipated?
[53]
The applicant Brar, by affidavit in support of the motion refers to various members of his family, including his father, his brother and two uncles who were said to have been killed in the attack on the Golden Temple at Amistar in 1984 or subsequently. Two other brothers, his grandfather, four uncles and several cousins, unnamed, are said to have been harassed, arrested, detained and in some cases tortured by authorities in India. The affidavit refers to an incident where the brother of a leader in a Sikh student organization was killed, and also to the revocation of Brar's passport by the Government of India and advice to him that an emergency certificate would be issued to him for a one-time journey to India. On this basis the applicant says that if S.I.R.C. proceedings were to continue
"... to their logical conclusion, without my having a full opportunity to know the case against me and rebut allegations against me through crossexamination and normally accepted rules and procedures of natural justice then irreparable harm could result. More clearly I face prosecution, torture and death for political reasons, upon my return to Indian."
[54]
Counsel for the Ministers and the Director C.S.I.S. characterizes these statements about the fate of family members as hearsay, since the applicant has been away from India, where the incidents are said to have occurred, for some years. Also he submits that neither the motion nor the affidavit in its support include a direct claim of irreparable harm to the applicant. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)) Finally, at this stage of proceedings it is said that there is no direct connection between proceedings of S.I.R.C. and the ultimate decisions that may be made in relation to Brar's status in Canada. The last argument is analogous to that of counsel for the Chairman S.I.R.C., that it is premature to seek injunctive relief for at this stage the conclusions S.I.R.C. may reach and any action that may be taken in the exercise of discretion by the Governor-in-Council, or by the Minister under the Immigration Act cannot be predicated. On these grounds it is urged that there is no demonstration by Brar of irreparable harm, or the probability of irreparable harm by violation of his rights as a result of the Committee's proceedings. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 481; 13 C.P.R. 287, per Dickson, C.J., at p. 458 S.C.R.)
[55]
Both counsel for the respondent parties also submit that irreparable harm would result for the respondents if an interlocutory injunction were granted. Some of these claims to irreparable harm, that the entire functional role of S.I.R.C. would be disrupted or that the carefully developed civilian supervised security arrangements established by Parliament under the C.S.I.S. Act would be thwarted, seem to me overdrawn. The applicant's response to this is that all that is sought here is an order directing proceedings be stopped until procedures consistent with the law and the Charter are in place, an order exempting this case from the existing process without suppressing the process for all other functions or cases of S.I.R.C. operations. Nevertheless, there is a principle here involved, that an interlocutory injunction granted against a public authority, which is deemed to act lawfully until determined otherwise in an action, can be said to result in irreparable harm to the public interest (see:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)).
[56]
I conclude that in this case there is no clearly established irreparable harm that will be caused to the applicant by continuance of the S.I. R.C. proceedings. There is, on the other hand, inevitable irreparable harm to the respondents and to the public interest which they serve under statutory authority if an interlocutory injunction were to suspend the pursuit of their responsibilities, or even if an exemption from their responsibilities in relation to this case pending trial on the issues were the result of an injunction at this stage.
Where Does The Balance Of Convenience Lie?
[57]
In addition to balancing the probability of irreparable harm to the parties from the grant or denial of an interlocutory injunction there are other factors to be considered in weighing the interests of the parties here. The applicant seeks exemption from the process arising from s. 39 of the Immigration Act, only for such time as it may require for trial on the merits of his claims, not that the legislation be struck down but that the procedures of S.I.R.C. be made to conform with the Charter rights claimed and with common law standards of fairness. The respondents submit, with reference to the judgment of Mr. Justice Beetz in Metropolitan  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that the public interest in maintaining the system of civilian direction of security services, including investigations in cases like this, and the importance in such a system of protecting national security mitigates against the grant of an interlocutory injunction. There is, of course, a public interest in ensuring fair procedures for the individual who is subject to investigation by government as well as the private interests of the individual involved. If this were a case where other factors were reasonably balanced, which it is submitted it is not because of the public interests that support denial of an injunction, then denial would also be supportable with the objective of maintaining the status quo as between the parties pending trial.
[58]
After considering the claims to irreparable harm from granting or refusing an interlocutory order and assessing the public interests involved, it is my conclusion that in this case the balance of convenience favours denial of the application. The issues raised in the action, important as they are, may be fully resolved by a trial. In any interval before trial, the situation of the applicant, Brar, may well be dealt with in terms of a report from S.I.R.C. Indeed decisions may even be made that will affect his status and any claim he may have to remain in Canada. That might render the concerns raised in this action and this application moot from the perspective of the applicant but it will not preclude other claims to relief that may arise in relation to any action or decision that may be taken against his interests.
Conclusion
[59]
I acknowledge the helpful work of all counsel in this matter. Much of their argument and many of the authorities to which I was referred concerned procedural safeguards recognized by law for the individual who is subject to investigation or prosecution. While these were helpful in persuading me that there are serious issues to be tried, resolution of those issues is for another day if there be a trial. I conclude that the application for an interlocutory injunction and related relief pending trial of the action in this matter should be dismissed and an order will go to this effect, with costs to the respondents.
[60]
That conclusion effectively provides one answer to the oral application by counsel for Brar, made at the conclusion of the hearing, for an interim injunction until disposition of this application. But there are other reasons, orally rendered at the time the motion for interim relief was dismissed which I then indicated would be recorded here.
[61]
The main reason for denying an interim injunction here was related to the principle recognized by Beetz, J., in Metropolitan  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , (see: [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110 at 135, 142-144) that laws enacted by the legislature are to be respected and enforced until by trial they are found to be unconstitutional, aside from very exceptional cases which this is not. Moreover, it is well-established that regular proceedings under statute should not be suspended pending resolution of constitutional arguments. It seems to me those principles, applicable in considering interlocutory injunctions, must also be respected in considering a request for interim relief pending disposition of an application for interlocutory relief.
Application dismissed.

Footnotes
1. In addition to the changes already referred to, Parliament also enacted An Act to Amend the Immigration Act, 1976 and the Criminal Code in consequence thereof, S.C. 1988, c. 36 (also proclaimed in force January 1, 1989, now c. 29 (4th Supp.)). By this Act s. 39 of the Immigration Act, 1976 was amended to limit references by the Ministers to the Security Intelligence Review Committee to cases of persons already granted permanent residence. A new s. 41 was enacted to deal with persons other than Canadian citizens or permanent residents, as is the situation of the applicant in this case, and the concerned Ministers were authorized to file with this court a certificate of their conclusion that a person does not qualify for admission, for review by a summary process of the court to determine whether the certificate is reasonable on the evidence and information provided to the judge. In effect, this change provides a form of judicial review, perhaps somewhat limited in scope, in the case of an applicant for refugee status who is not a permanent resident and who for security (or other specified) reasons may not be admitted to Canada. The applicant in proceedings herein may or may not have access to this new process since the S.I.R.C. proceedings were begun under s. 39(2) as it was before January 1, 1989. Prior to that date this application would have been dealt with on its merits without the preliminary step of formally seeking leave to proceed under s. 18. After January 1, 1989, a case like that of the applicant herein would be referred by the Ministers for review by a judge of this court."
2. The Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, subsequently in force, includes in ss. 39 and 40 provisions that are substantively similar to ss. 39 and 40 here quoted, but the later statutory provisions are drafted differently.
3. Included were published papers on The Charter and the Tribunals, prepared for a program in Toronto, November 28, 1988, sponsored by the Law Society of Upper Canada and the Toronto Department of Education. Among these were M. Eberts, Section 7 of the Charter plus natural justice: An Administrative Justice Section 11?; L. Taman, Jurisdiction of Administrative Tribunals to Consider Charter Arguments; John D. Richard, Particular Issues Relating to Federal Tribunals; J. Shields and Ian C. Vallance, Procedural Fairness: Section 11 and the Role of Counsel. In addition counsel referred to I.G. Whitehall, Administrative Tribunals and Section 7 of the Charter from Charter Issues in Civil Cases, 1988 and G.R. Garton, Civil Litigation Under the Charter from Charter Issues in Civil Cases, 1988.
