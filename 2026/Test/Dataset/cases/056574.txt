I.
Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to section 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD], rejecting the Applicant's claim to refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.
II.
Factual Background
[2]
The Applicant is a male Tamil from Northern Sri Lanka, who claims refugee protection on the basis of a fear of persecution by the Sri Lankan army and security forces [SLA], Sri Lankan paramilitary groups, and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE].
[3]
In January 2006, in the context of the progressive erosion of the Cease Fire Agreement entered between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE, and in the LTTE'S effort to recruit new members, the Applicant was forcibly brought to an LTTE camp, where he was tortured.
[4]
On the third day of his detention by the LTTE, the Applicant managed to escape and went into hiding. Shortly thereafter, on suspicion of being an LTTE member on the basis of his Tamil ethnicity, the SLA and paramilitary groups brought the Applicant to a camp, where he was tortured. The Applicant was beaten and administered electric shocks to his fingers.
[5]
In February 2006, the Applicant's uncle presented himself to the camp where the Applicant was held and bribed the SLA in exchange for the Applicant's release.
[6]
With the help of his uncle, the Applicant fled Sri Lanka and worked in a third country under a false work permit.
[7]
With the help of an agent, the Applicant traveled to Canada aboard the
MV Sun Sea
ship on August 13, 2010 and claimed refugee protection on October 7, 2010.
[8]
A hearing was held before the RPD on March 13, 2014.
III.
Impugned Decision
[9]
By reasons dated August 21, 2014, the RPD concludes that the Applicant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under the IRPA.
[10]
Although, the RPD identifies some issues with the evidence provided by the Applicant, the RPD finds the Applicant's overall testimony to be credible; however, the RPD concludes that the Applicant failed to demonstrate the required objective basis of his fear, for the purposes of sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.
[11]
More precisely, the RPD concludes that on a balance of probabilities, the Applicant's "profile is not one such that he would be at risk of being associated with the LTTE", that he had "no connections with the LTTE, nor was he, or would he be, targeted by the government as a LTTE supporter" (RPD Decision, at para 29).
[12]
In respect of the Applicant's
sur place
claim, as a passenger on the
MV Sun Sea
, the RPD concludes that the Applicant's profile is not one of heightened risk as a result of his manner of travel to Canada, nor does not face a risk contemplated by section 97 as a Tamil failed refugee claimant returnee.
IV.
Legislative Provisions
[13]
The following provisions of the IRPA are applicable to the RPD's determination of refugee status:
Convention refugee
96
. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(
b
) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97
. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(
a
) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
Définition de « réfugié »
96
. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays don't elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
Personne à protéger
97
. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays don't elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
V.
Standard of Review
[14]
The RPD's assessment of the Applicant's credibility, and of whether the Applicant faces a risk upon return to Sri Lanka are determinations of fact and of mixed fact and law, which are reviewable on the deferential standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[15]
Therefore, it is not within this Court's jurisdiction to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, or reweigh the evidence ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 59).
VI.
Arguments and Analysis
[16]
The Applicant puts forth five main arguments in support of his claim, which the Court will address in turn.
A.
Standard of proof
[17]
First, the Applicant submits that the RPD applied the incorrect burden of proof in determining whether the Applicant falls within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. According to the Applicant, this error must be reviewed on the non-deferential standard of correctness. In particular, the Applicant submits that the RPD applied a higher burden of proof upon the Applicant of proving a
probability of persecution
, which is inferred by the RPD's use of words such as "personally targeted", "would he be", "would be" and "seriously suspected".
[18]
The Court agrees with the Respondent's view according to which the RPD reasonably identified and applied the adequate legal test in accordance with the jurisprudence.
[19]
First, the words used by the RPD, taken in context, do not reflect an erroneous understanding or application of the applicable analytical framework in respect of interpreting sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
Second, the Court's view is grounded in the distinction between the applicable standard of proof and the legal test to be met. As summarized by the Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; aff'd in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[184] A distinction has to be drawn between the legal test to be applied in assessing the risk of future persecution, and the standard of proof to be applied with respect to the facts underlying the claim itself. While the legal test for persecution only requires a demonstration that there is more than a mere possibility that the individual will face persecution in the future, the standard of proof applicable to the facts underlying the claim is that of the balance of probabilities:
Adjei
, at p. 682. See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2005 FCA 1 at para. 9-14 and 29.
B.
The RPD's credibility assessment
[21]
Third, the Applicant takes issues with the RPD's overall positive credibility finding in respect of the Applicant's testimony - which includes the Applicant's arbitrary arrest, detention and torture, and ultimate finding that the Applicant does not face persecution or risk to life, harm, or unusual treatment as contemplated by the IRPA.
[22]
The Applicant maintains that the RPD was compelled to clearly state its reasons for rejecting the Applicant's credibility in these respects.
[23]
The Respondent argues that the presumption of truth of the Applicant's testimony does not extend to the inferences the RPD may draw from those facts. It was therefore reasonable for the RPD to find that the Applicant was credible in his testimony, but to conclude that he was not, at the time of the hearing, suspected of having links with the LTTE.
[24]
The Court observes that the RPD's reasons are at first glance ambiguous, to the extent that the RPD identifies credibility as one of the "determinative issues i[n] this claim" (RPD Decision, at para 11) while sustaining that the Applicant was generally credible in his testimony and that the shortcomings in respect of the Applicant's documents are "insufficient on a balance of probabilities to finding him not credible" (RPD Decision, at para 33).
[25]
A careful examination of the RPD's reasons reveals that the RPD's findings in respect of credibility are consistent, inherently logical, and anchored in the evidence.
[26]
It was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude on the one hand, that the Applicant was credible in his testimony, but to find, on the other hand, that the Applicant did not establish the existence of more than a mere possibility that he would face a risk to his life upon return to Sri Lanka, as contemplated by section 97.
[27]
The RPD's positive credibility findings in respect of the Applicant's detention and arrest, do not automatically lend themselves to a finding that the Applicant would be subjected to persecution on the same basis today, nor that he faces a prospective risk upon return to Sri Lanka for having been suspected of LTTE support or membership, in the past.
C.
Applicant's allegations of torture
[28]
Fourth, the Applicant takes issue with the RPD's determination that the Applicant was subjected to torture but that his "treatment was not so egregious as to support a claim for compelling reasons" and that the "fact that his torture was not sustained and that he was freed with a bribe suggest [...] that he would not be at a high risk of torture in the future" (RPD Decision, at paras 41 and 60). According to the Applicant, the RPD's conclusions imply that it was necessary for the Applicant to have sustained torture for him to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in Sri Lanka. The Applicant contends that the RPD unreasonably equaled torture with persecution, and that its finding in this respect is not only speculative, but also an error in law.
[29]
The Court agrees with the Respondent that the legal tests for refugee status determination are forward-looking and the onus rests upon an applicant to demonstrate that, at the time of the hearing, he meets the requirements of section 96 or of section 97 of the IRPA. Therefore, as mentioned above, although past incidents of alleged persecution are possible indicators of the risk of future persecution, proof of past persecution is not sufficient, in and of itself, to form a basis to grant refugee protection under the IRPA. Also, it has been found that the fact that a refugee claimant was merely onboard the
MV Sun Sea
is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish a
sur place
claim ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 12). Moreover, "the fear of persecution must be forward-looking and the risk must be personalized" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
The Court cannot accept the Applicant's argument according to which the RPD's own findings that the Applicant could face arrest and detention upon return to Sri Lanka is equivalent to an admission of the well-foundedness of the Applicant's objective fear.
[31]
Finally, the RPD's finding of absence of "compelling reasons" for the purposes of subsection 108(4) of the IRPA is not unreasonable. A "compelling reasons" assessment under subsection 108(4) does not need to be undertaken in every case but rather should be made, for instance, when a claimant was found to be a refugee but nevertheless had been denied refugee status given the change of circumstances in the country of origin (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
D.
The Applicant's membership in the LTTE
[32]
Fourth, the Applicant argues that the RPD created an unreasonable distinction between LTTE suspects who are "truly", and those who are "not truly" suspected of supporting the LTTE. According to the Applicant, the RPD does so by recognizing on the one hand that the Applicant was questioned by the SLA on the basis of possible ties with the LTTE, but that he was not, on the other hand, "truly" suspected of such ties, because it is unlikely that a bribe would have been accepted in exchange for his release. The Applicant further submits that the RPD created a new category of "true" LTTE suspects, which suggests that a higher involvement in the LTTE is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution.
[33]
The Respondent submits that the Applicant expresses a disagreement with the RPD's assessment of the evidence, which is insufficient to warrant the Court's intervention; the RPD was entitled to attribute greater weight to some portions of the evidence, with supporting reasons.
[34]
The Court considers that the Applicant's reading of the RPD's findings fails to consider the RPD's findings within their inherent logic or context.
[35]
Consistent with the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
[UNHCR]
Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Sri Lanka
of July 5, 2014, this Court has stated that each claim must engage an individualized assessment (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[36]
The RPD considered the Applicant's testimony and evidence provided, in conjunction with the documentary evidence which suggests that returning Tamils are subjected to the same screening process for all persons returning to Sri Lanka, regardless of whether they are returning on a voluntary basis or as the result of a failed refugee claim, and with evidence attesting to programs and initiatives which have been implemented since the end of the armed conflict in April 2009 through which:
[...] former LTTE combatants and LTTE members and many others suspected of having links with the LTTE have been mobilized and have gone through a "rehabilitation" programme. This has been implemented by the Rehabilitation and Prison Reform Ministry, under the overall guidance and control of the Ministry of Defence. A total of 11,000 individuals with alleged links to the LTTE - mostly former combatants, but also drivers, cooks and other aides - have undergone this process (RPD Decision, 44).
[37]
The RPD further adds, in respect to the Applicant's individual circumstances:
The claimant has not alleged that he was seriously suspected in the past of having links with the LTTE. He was able to leave the country using his own passport and was not detained at the airport security points as someone wanted by the government. I conclude that the claimant was not suspected of having links with the LTTE.
The claimant has been away from Sri Lanka for over eight years. There is no evidence that he has participated with the LTTE during his time outside the country. Returnees are subject to inspection when arriving in Sri Lanka. Some groups have suggested that failed asylum claimants are being tortured when questioned on their return. The same document provides equally credible evidence that this is not occurring and that the UNHCR has long-term monitoring programs for refugee returns. On balance, I find that the claimant would not be at risk of cruel and unusual punishment or any other harm on his return (RPD Decision, at paras 44 and 45).
[38]
The RPD then proceeds to evaluate the risk faced by the Applicant upon return to Sri Lanka, as a passenger who traveled to Canada abroad the
MV Sun Sea
. Following a balanced review of the documentary evidence and a number of factors, the RPD concludes that the Applicant does not fit the profile of someone who would be suspected of having ties to the LTTE on the basis of having traveled aboard the
MV Sun Sea
.
[39]
It was reasonably open to the RPD to find that on a balance of probabilities, the Applicant was not suspected of LTTE involvement or of having any association with the LTTE and that he therefore lacked an objective basis to his alleged fear and risk upon return, which in his particular circumstances, was detrimental to his claim.
[40]
As stated by Justice Catherine M. Kane, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[64] The Board did not ignore any evidence; rather, it attached greater weight to some evidence, identified the evidence that it did not rely on and provided reasons for doing so. The Board conducted an individualised assessment of the applicant and concluded that upon return to Sri Lanka, he would be questioned, but that he would not face a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of torture, because he would not be suspected or perceived to have ties to the LTTE. The Board's decision is reasonable.
E.
The RPD's assessment of the documentary evidence and the Respondent's duty to disclose
[41]
Finally, the Applicant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of the documentary evidence.
[42]
Upon review of the Certified Tribunal Record [CTR], the Court is of the view that the RPD's reasons reflect a careful weighing of competing evidence, including evidence which demonstrated both that returning Tamil Sri Lankans have faced torture upon return, as well as evidence which pointed to a low probability that the Applicant would face a risk of harm upon return. The RPD also acknowledged that the current situation in Sri Lanka is not perfect for Tamils, especially for those suspected of ties with the LTTE.
[43]
The Court finds that the RPD's findings are nuanced and anchored in the evidence, in conformity with the requirements of transparency, intelligibility and justification. The Court adopts the reasoning expressed by Justice Judith A. Snider in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 17:
[17] Moreover, and more importantly, the decision is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. It is possible for different conclusions to be reached on similar facts. I acknowledge that the Applicant put forward a rational line of reasoning for finding that the Applicant was at risk because of his passage on the M/V Sun Sea. However, that does not mean that the line of reasoning followed by the Board is unreasonable.
The existence of a range of possible outcomes is the hallmark of the reasonableness standard and is the foundation of the deference owed to decision makers. Whether this Applicant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution is a factual question to be determined by the Board. While I or another panel member might have come to a different conclusion, the decision of this Board was reasonably open to it on this particular evidentiary record
. The Court should not intervene.
[Emphasis added.]
[44]
Finally, the Court rejects the Applicant's submission that the Respondent failed to meet his disclosure obligation, in particular, of a declaration of another passenger of the
MV Sun Sea
, (B016), who was detained and tortured upon return to Sri Lanka. Although each and every case is a case to be assessed on its own merits, thus, on its own evidence and any evidence which may be relevant thereto, the affidavit of passenger B016 is included in exhibit C-5 in the CTR and was therefore not omitted from disclosure.
VII.
Conclusion
[45]
In light of the foregoing, the Application must be dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[46]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no serious question of general importance to be certified.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Shore
[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée au titre du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la LIPR), d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) rejetant la demande d'asile présentée par le demandeur au titre des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR.
II.
Le contexte factuel
[2]
Le demandeur est un Tamoul du nord du Sri Lanka et il demande l'asile parce qu'il craint d'être persécuté par l'armée et les forces de sécurité sri-lankaises (SLA), des groupes paramilitaires sri-lankais et les Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (TLET).
[3]
En janvier 2006, dans le contexte de l'érosion progressive de l'accord de cessez-le-feu conclu entre le gouvernement sri-lankais et les TLET, et dans le cadre des efforts déployés par les TLET pour recruter de nouveaux membres, le demandeur a été conduit de force dans un camp des TLET, où il a été torturé.
[4]
Le troisième jour de sa détention par les TLET, le demandeur a réussi à s'échapper et est entré dans la clandestinité. Peu après, au motif que le demandeur était soupçonné d'être un membre des TLET en raison de son origine tamoule, la SLA et des groupes paramilitaires l'ont conduit dans un camp, où il a été torturé. Il a été battu, et des chocs électriques lui ont été administrés aux doigts.
[5]
En février 2006, l'oncle du demandeur s'est présenté au camp où le demandeur était détenu, et il a soudoyé la SLA en échange de la libération du demandeur.
[6]
Avec l'aide de son oncle, le demandeur a fui le Sri Lanka est allé travailler dans un pays tiers grâce à un faux permis de travail.
[7]
Avec l'aide d'un agent, le demandeur est venu au Canada à bord du
Sun Sea
(le
Sun Sea
) le 13 août 2010, et il a demandé l'asile le 7 octobre 2010.
[8]
Une audience a été tenue devant la SPR le 13 mars 2014.
III.
La décision attaquée
[9]
Par décision motivée datée du 21 août 2014, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'avait ni qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni qualité de personne à protéger au sens de la LIPR.
[10]
La SPR a opiné que les éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur étaient problématiques à certains égards, mais elle a conclu que, dans l'ensemble, le témoignage du demandeur était crédible; toutefois, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas réussi à démontrer l'existence d'un fondement objectif à sa crainte, comme il devait le faire pour l'application des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR.
[11]
Plus précisément, la SPR a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, « le profil du demandeur d'asile ne l'exposerait pas au risque d'être associé aux TLET, qu'il n'avait « aucun lien avec les TLET et qu'il n'était pas, ou ne serait pas, ciblé par le gouvernement à titre de partisan des TLET » (décision de la SPR, au paragraphe 29).
[12]
En ce qui concerne la demande d'asile du demandeur sur place, en tant que passager du
Sun Sea
, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas exposé à un risque plus grand en raison de la manière dont il était venu au Canada et qu'il ne serait pas exposé aux risques visés à l'article 97 en tant que demandeur d'asile tamoul débouté retournant dans son pays.
IV.
Dispositions législatives
[13]
Les dispositions suivantes de la LIPR sont applicables à la décision de la SPR statuant sur la question du statut de réfugié:
Définition de « réfugié »
96
. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
Personne à protéger
97
. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
Convention refugee
96
. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(
a
) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(
b
) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97
. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(
a
) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
V.
La norme de contrôle
[14]
L'évaluation de la crédibilité du demandeur par la SPR et son appréciation de la question de savoir si le demandeur serait en danger s'il retournait au Sri Lanka sont des questions de fait et des questions mixtes de fait et de droit, qui sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme déférente de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
[15]
Par conséquent, la Cour n'a pas compétence pour substituer la solution qui serait à son avis préférable à celle qui a été retenue ni pour réévaluer les éléments de preuve ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 59).
VI.
Arguments et analyse
[16]
Au soutien de sa demande, le demandeur formule cinq arguments principaux, que la Cour examinera tour à tour.
A.
La norme de preuve
[17]
Premièrement, le demandeur soutient que la SPR n'a pas appliqué le bon fardeau de preuve lorsqu'elle a décidé si le demandeur était visé par les articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR. Selon le demandeur, cette erreur doit être contrôlée selon la norme non déférente de la décision correcte. En particulier, le demandeur soutient que la SPR a appliqué un fardeau de preuve plus exigeant au demandeur en exigeant qu'il prouve une
probabilité de persécution
, comme on peut l'inférer de l'emploi par la SPR d'expressions telles « personnellement ciblé », « ne serait pas », « serait » et « sérieusement soupçonné ».
[18]
La Cour souscrit au point de vue du défendeur selon lequel la SPR a relevé et appliqué de façon raisonnable le critère juridique adéquat, en conformité avec la jurisprudence.
[19]
Premièrement, les mots employés par la SPR, pris en contexte, ne traduisent pas une compréhension ou une application erronée du cadre analytique applicable à l'interprétation des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 20).
[20]
Deuxièmement, la Cour fonde son avis sur la distinction entre la norme de preuve applicable et le critère juridique auquel il doit être satisfait. Comme la Cour l'a résumé dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; conf. par
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[184] Il convient de faire une distinction entre le critère juridique applicable à l'appréciation du risque de persécution futur et la norme de preuve applicable aux faits sous-jacents à la demande d'asile. Le critère juridique en matière de persécution exige simplement que l'intéressé établisse davantage qu'une simple possibilité qu'il fasse l'objet de persécution à l'avenir, mais la norme de preuve applicable aux faits sous-jacents à la demande est celle de la prépondérance de la preuve: Adjei, à la page 682. Voir également  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.), aux paragraphes 9 à 14 et 29.
B.
L'évaluation de la crédibilité faite par la SPR
[21]
Troisièmement, le demandeur reproche à la SPR d'avoir tiré une conclusion générale favorable quant à la crédibilité du témoignage du demandeur - dans lequel celui-ci relatait notamment son arrestation, sa détention et sa torture arbitraires -, puis d'avoir conclu en dernière analyse que le demandeur ne courait pas le risque d'être persécuté ou tué ou de subir un préjudice ou un traitement inusité au sens de la LIPR.
[22]
Le demandeur soutient que la SPR était tenue d'énoncer clairement les motifs pour lesquels elle estimait que le demandeur n'était pas crédible à ces égards.
[23]
Le défendeur soutient que la présomption de véracité du témoignage du demandeur ne s'étend pas aux inférences que la SPR peut tirer de ces faits. Il était donc raisonnable que la SPR conclue que le témoignage du demandeur était crédible, mais qu'au moment de l'audience, il n'était pas soupçonné d'avoir des liens avec les TLET.
[24]
La Cour fait remarquer que les motifs de la SPR sont ambigus à première vue, dans la mesure où la SPR évoque la crédibilité comme une des « questions déterminantes à trancher en l'espèce » (décision de la SPR, au paragraphe 11), tout en soutenant que le témoignage du demandeur était crédible dans l'ensemble et que les lacunes dans les documents du demandeur « ne suffis[aient] pas, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, pour conclure que le demandeur d'asile n'[était] pas crédible » (décision de la SPR, au paragraphe 33).
[25]
Un examen soigneux des motifs de la SPR révèle que les conclusions de la SPR concernant la crédibilité sont cohérentes, qu'elles sont intrinsèquement logiques, et qu'elles sont ancrées dans la preuve.
[26]
Il n'était pas déraisonnable que la SPR conclue, d'une part, que le témoignage du demandeur était crédible, et conclue, d'autre part, que le demandeur n'avait pas établi l'existence de plus qu'une simple possibilité qu'il soit exposé à une menace à sa vie à son retour au Sri Lanka, au sens de l'article 97.
[27]
Les conclusions favorables de la SPR concernant la crédibilité relativement à la détention et à l'arrestation du demandeur n'emportent pas d'emblée à elles seules la conclusion que le demandeur serait victime de persécution pour le même motif aujourd'hui, ni qu'il serait exposé à un risque à son retour au Sri Lanka du fait d'avoir été soupçonné dans le passé d'appuyer les TLET ou d'y appartenir.
C.
Les allégations de torture du demandeur
[28]
Quatrièmement, le demandeur critique la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le demandeur a été torturé, mais ce « traitement n'était pas horrible au point d'étayer des allégations de motifs impérieux » et le « fait que ces actes de torture n'ont pas duré et que le demandeur d'asile a été libéré moyennant le versement d'un pot-de-vin [...] porte à croire qu'il ne serait pas exposé à un risque élevé de torture à l'avenir » (décision de la SPR, aux paragraphes 41 et 60). Selon le demandeur, les conclusions de la SPR impliquent qu'il était nécessaire que le demandeur ait subi de la torture pour pouvoir démontrer qu'il craint avec raison d'être persécuté au Sri Lanka. Le demandeur soutient que la SPR a de façon déraisonnable assimilé la torture et la persécution, et que sa conclusion à cet égard est non seulement hypothétique, mais elle constitue également une erreur en droit.
[29]
La Cour convient avec le défendeur que les critères juridiques applicables pour déterminer le statut de réfugié s'apprécient de manière prospective et il incombe au demandeur de démontrer qu'au moment de l'audience, il satisfait aux exigences de l'article 96 ou de l'article 97 de la LIPR. Par conséquent, comme je l'ai déjà mentionné, des incidents passés de persécution alléguée sont des indicateurs possibles d'un risque de persécution future, mais la preuve d'une persécution passée n'est pas suffisante, en elle-même, pour justifier d'accorder le droit d'asile en vertu de la LIPR. De plus, il a été statué que le simple fait qu'un demandeur d'asile ait été à bord du
Sun Sea
n'était pas suffisant, en soi, pour justifier d'accueillir une demande d'asile sur place ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 12). En outre, « la crainte de persécution doit être évaluée de manière prospective et le risque doit être personnalisé » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
La Cour ne peut pas retenir l'argument du demandeur selon lequel les conclusions de la SPR selon lesquelles le demandeur risquerait peut-être d'être arrêté et détenu à son retour au Sri Lanka équivalent à une admission du bien-fondé de la crainte objective du demandeur.
[31]
Enfin, la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle il n'y avait pas de « raisons impérieuses » au sens du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR n'était pas déraisonnable. Il n'est pas nécessaire de procéder dans tous les cas à une évaluation des raisons impérieuses au sens du paragraphe 108(4), qui devrait plutôt être entreprise, par exemple, dans le cas où le demandeur d'asile s'est vu reconnaître la qualité de réfugié, mais que ce statut lui a été refusé en raison d'un changement des conditions dans le pays d'origine (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 19).
D.
L'appartenance du demandeur aux TLET
[32]
Quatrièmement, le demandeur soutient que la SPR a opéré une distinction déraisonnable entre les personnes soupçonnées d'appartenir aux TLET qui sont « vraiment » soupçonnées d'appuyer les TLET et celles qui « ne sont pas vraiment » soupçonnées d'appuyer les TLET. Selon le demandeur, la SPR opère cette distinction en reconnaissant, d'une part, que le demandeur a été interrogé par la SLA en raison de ses possibles liens avec les TLET, mais que d'autre part, qu'il n'était pas « vraiment » soupçonné d'avoir de tels liens, parce qu'il aurait été invraisemblable qu'un pot-de-vin permette sa libération. Le demandeur soutient en outre que la SPR a créé une nouvelle catégorie de personnes » vraiment » soupçonnées d'appartenir aux TLET, ce qui tend à indiquer que des liens plus étroits sont nécessaires pour que le demandeur puisse démontrer qu'il craint avec raison d'être persécuté.
[33]
Le défendeur soutient que le demandeur exprime un désaccord avec la manière dont la SPR a évalué la preuve, ce qui est insuffisant pour justifier l'intervention de la Cour; il était loisible à la SPR d'accorder plus de poids à certaines parties de son témoignage, avec motifs à l'appui.
[34]
La Cour estime que la lecture des conclusions de la SPR par le demandeur omet d'apprécier les conclusions de la SPR dans le cadre de leur logique inhérente ou de leur contexte.
[35]
En conformité avec les lignes directrices du Haut-commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés [UNHCR] concernant l'évaluation du droit à la protection internationale des demandeurs d'asile sri lankais, publiées le 5 juillet 2014,la Cour a affirmé que chaque demande d'asile devait être examinée selon la situation qui lui est propre (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 51;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[36]
La SPR a examiné le témoignage et les éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur ainsi que les éléments de preuve documentaire qui tendent à indiquer que les Tamouls qui retournent au Sri Lanka sont assujettis à la même procédure de contrôle applicable à toutes les personnes qui retournent au Sri Lanka, peu importe qu'ils retournent au Sri Lanka volontairement ou après avoir été déboutés d'une demande d'asile, et des éléments de preuve attestant de programmes et d'initiatives qui ont été mis en œuvre depuis la fin du conflit armé en avril 2009, dans le cadre desquels:
[...] d'anciens combattants et membres des TLET ainsi que de nombreuses autres personnes soupçonnées d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET ont été démobilisés et ont participé à un programme de « réadaptation ». Cette initiative a été mise en œuvre par le ministère de la réforme de la réadaptation et des prisons, sous la supervision générale du ministère de la Défense. Un total de plus de 11 000 personnes ayant de présumés liens avec les TLET - pour la plupart des anciens combattants, mais aussi des chauffeurs, des cuisiniers et d'autres assistants - ont subi ce processus (décision de la SPR au paragraphe 44).
[37]
La SPR ajoute, au sujet de la situation personnelle du demandeur:
Le demandeur d'asile n'a pas prétendu avoir été sérieusement soupçonné par le passé d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET. Il a réussi à quitter le pays muni de son propre passeport, et il n'a pas été détenu aux points de sécurité à l'aéroport à titre de personne recherchée par le gouvernement. Je conclus que le demandeur d'asile n'était pas soupçonné d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET.
Le demandeur d'asile s'est absenté du Sri Lanka pendant plus de huit ans. Rien ne permet de penser qu'il a joué un rôle au sein des TLET pendant son séjour hors du pays. Les personnes qui retournent au Sri Lanka font l'objet d'une inspection à leur arrivée. Certains groupes ont laissé entendre que des demandeurs d'asile déboutés sont torturés lorsqu'ils sont interrogés à leur retour. Le même document fournit des éléments de preuve tout aussi crédibles selon lesquels cela ne se produit pas, et le HCR a des programmes de suivi à long terme du retour des réfugiés. Tout compte fait, j'estime que le demandeur d'asile ne serait pas exposé au risque de peines cruelles et inusitées ou de subir un autre préjudice à son retour (décision de la SPR aux paragraphes 44 et 45).
[38]
La SPR procède ensuite à une évaluation du risque auquel serait exposé le demandeur à son retour au Sri Lanka, en tant que passager arrivé au Canada à bord du
Sun Sea
. À la suite d'un examen équilibré des éléments de preuve documentaire et de plusieurs facteurs, la SPR conclut que le demandeur n'a pas le profil d'une personne qui serait soupçonnée d'avoir des liens avec les TLET au motif qu'il a voyagé à bord du
Sun Sea
.
[39]
Il était raisonnablement loisible à la SPR de conclure que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur n'était pas soupçonné d'appartenir aux TLET ni d'avoir quelque lien que ce soit avec les TLET, et il manquait donc un fondement objectif à sa crainte alléguée et au risque auquel il prétendait qu'il serait exposé à son retour, ce qui, dans sa situation personnelle, minait sa demande d'asile.
[40]
La juge Catherine M. Kane a affirmé ce qui suit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[64] La Commission n'a ignoré aucune preuve; elle a plutôt accordé plus d'importance à certains éléments, et indiqué ceux qu'elle a écartés en expliquant ses motifs. La Commission a évalué individuellement le cas du demandeur et a conclu qu'à son retour au Sri Lanka, il serait interrogé, sans toutefois être exposé à une menace à sa vie, ou à un risque de traitement ou de peine cruels et inusités ou de torture, parce qu'il ne serait pas soupçonné d'avoir des liens avec les TLET, ou considéré comme tel. La décision de la Commission est raisonnable.
E.
L'évaluation des éléments de preuve documentaire par la SPR et l'obligation de communication du défendeur
[41]
Enfin, le demandeur soutient que la SPR a commis une erreur dans son évaluation des éléments de preuve documentaire.
[42]
Après avoir examiné le dossier certifié du tribunal (DCT), la Cour est d'avis que les motifs de la SPR traduisent une pondération soigneuse d'éléments de preuve contradictoires, notamment des éléments de preuve qui démontraient que des Sri-lankais tamouls qui étaient retournés dans leur pays avaient été torturés à leur retour, ainsi que des éléments de preuve qui tendaient à indiquer une faible probabilité que le demandeur soit exposé au risque de subir un préjudice à son retour. La SPR a également reconnu que la situation actuelle au Sri Lanka n'était pas parfaite pour les Tamouls, en particulier pour ceux qui étaient soupçonnés d'avoir des liens avec les TLET.
[43]
La Cour conclut que les conclusions de la SPR sont nuancées et sont ancrées dans les éléments de preuve, en conformité avec les principes de transparence, d'intelligibilité et de justification. La Cour adopte le raisonnement exposé par la juge Snider dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 17:
[17] En outre, et il s'agit d'un facteur encore plus important, la décision est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité. Il est possible de parvenir à des conclusions différentes à partir de faits similaires. Je reconnais que le demandeur a mis de l'avant un raisonnement logique à l'appui de la conclusion qu'il était exposé à un risque, en raison de son arrivée au pays à bord du NM Sun Sea. Cela ne signifie toutefois pas que le raisonnement adopté par la Commission était déraisonnable.
L'existence d'un éventail d'issues possibles est la caractéristique principale de la norme de la raisonnabilité et elle constitue la fondation de la déférence envers les décideurs. La question de savoir si le demandeur en l'espèce serait exposé à plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution était une question factuelle qui relevait de la Commission. Malgré le fait qu'il soit possible que moi, ou qu'un autre commissaire, ayons pu parvenir à une conclusion différente, il était raisonnablement loisible à ce tribunal de la Commission d'en arriver à cette décision, au vu du dossier de preuve en l'espèce
. La Cour ne devrait pas intervenir.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[44]
Enfin, la Cour rejette la prétention du demandeur selon laquelle le défendeur ne s'est pas acquitté de son obligation de communication de la preuve, en particulier de la déclaration d'un autre passager du
Sun Sea
(B016), qui avait été détenu et torturé à son retour au Sri Lanka. Toutes et chacune des affaires doivent être appréciées en fonction des faits qui leur sont propres, et donc, en fonction de leurs propres éléments de preuve et de tout élément de preuve qui pourrait être pertinents au regard de l'affaire, mais l'affidavit du passager B016 est inclus dans la pièce C-5 du DCT et n'a donc pas été omis de l'ensemble des éléments de preuve communiqués.
VII.
