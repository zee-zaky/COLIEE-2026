INTRODUCTION
[1]
Heneghan, J.
: George William Harris (the "Plaintiff") seeks an order pursuant to Rule 229 of the
Federal Court Rules, 1998
(the "Rules"), requiring disclosure of documents listed in Schedule "2" of the Affidavit of Documents provided by the Defendants in this action and the name of the taxpayer who was granted a particular advance income tax ruling in 1991. That tax ruling and the manner in which it was obtained are the subject of this action.
[2]
The Defendants resist the making of such order and assert the public interest immunity conferred by the
Canada Evidence Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, s. 37(2) (the "
Act
").
FACTS
[3]
The Plaintiff is a member of an unincorporated public interest group named "CHOICES" which is an organization interested in social justice and fiscal issues. The Plaintiff represents this group in its challenge of the advance tax ruling issued by the Defendant Minister of National Revenue in December 1991, specifically the manner in which the
Income Tax Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5
th
supp.) (the "
Income Tax Act
") was interpreted in conferring an apparent beneficial tax treatment of a Canadian resident trust following its relocation outside the country.
[4]
Following attempts by the Defendants to strike out the Statement of Claim on the grounds that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action and that the Plaintiff lacked standing to bring this action, the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) (
"Harris No. 1
") decided that the Statement of Claim does raise a justiciable issue and that the Plaintiff had established public interest standing to pursue the action. The Defendants' application for leave to appeal this decision was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada on October 26, 2000 [264 N.R. 391], without reasons.
[5]
In the course of completing pre-trial processes, including discovery of documents and discovery examinations, the Defendants prepared an Affidavit of Documents. This included, in Schedule "2", a number of documents for which privilege against production was asserted on the grounds of section 241 of the
Income Tax Act
and section 37 of the
Act
.
[6]
The Defendants sought directions from myself with respect to the assertions of privilege. In reasons dated December 20, 2000 [see 194 F.T.R. 131] I ordered the disclosure of the documents listed in Schedule "2", including any information that would disclose the identity of the taxpayer, to counsel for the Plaintiffs and any other lawyers working on the case, subject to the confidentiality provisions of Rules 151 and 152.
[7]
In its judgment in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 268 N.R. 384 ("
Harris No. 2
"), dated March 19, 2001, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld that portion of my judgment dealing with section 241 of the
Income Tax Act
but found that I had erroneously ordered disclosure of the identity of the taxpayer in the absence of evidence to determine that that information was relevant to the allegations in the statement of claim. The Court of Appeal vacated my direction that the documents in Schedule "2" were not immune from disclosure and directed that I should conduct a redetermination of the Defendants' application pursuant to section 37 of the
Act
.
PLAINTIFF'S SUBMISSIONS
[8]
The Plaintiff argues that he requires access, through his lawyers, to the identity of the taxpayer, its lawyers, accountants and advisors in order to obtain information which is not available from the Defendants. The Plaintiff claims that only the taxpayer and its representatives can provide information about the reasons for the requested ruling, the circumstances surrounding the underlying transaction, subsequent treatment of the property and payment of taxes in Canada or elsewhere.
[9]
The Plaintiff denies that he is simply seeking information to bolster the Statement of Claim. He characterizes this information as necessary to his claim that the favourable advance tax ruling granted to the taxpayer was subject to outside influence exercised upon the decision-maker, that is the Defendant, Minister of National Revenue.
[10]
The Plaintiff filed his affidavit in support of this Notice of Motion. In his Affidavit, he states his belief that the proper presentation of his case depends on the disclosure of all relevant information and that sensitive information can be protected by editing, confidentiality orders or
in camera
proceedings. He maintains that there is no allegation of wrong-doing against the taxpayer and that the information is not sought for the purpose of pursuing any claim of wrong-doing by the taxpayer.
[11]
Rather, the Plaintiff argues that the identity of the taxpayer and its various advisors is necessary for a full adjudication of the claims raised in the Statement of Claim. The Plaintiff says that only the taxpayer and its advisors can testify about the timing of the transaction in question, the reason for the advance tax ruling, the reason for the apparent urgency in obtaining the ruling, any subsequent disposition of the property and payment of any income tax.
DEFENDANT'S SUBMISSIONS
[12]
The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff has failed to show the relevancy of the requested information to this action and take the position that the Plaintiff is on a fishing expedition, seeking information to shore up his cause of action.
[13]
The Defendants rely on the Statement of Claim, specifically the statement in paragraph 22, as follows:
"The Plaintiff says that no confidential or legally privileged information relating to the personal or business affairs of any taxpayer will need to be disclosed during the process of hearing and determining this action."
[14]
Next, the Defendants move to the public interest immunity asserted pursuant to section 37(2) of the
Act
. The Defendants submit that even if the information sought by the Plaintiff is relevant, its disclosure is prohibited on the basis of public interest immunity. The Defendants argue that the specified public interest in this case is the maintenance of candour in the exchange of information between any taxpayer and the tax collector, formerly the Department of National Revenue and now the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (the "C.C.R.A."), to ensure the proper administration of the
Act
. Ray Shultis, in the Amended Certificate filed in support of the claim for privilege under section 37(2) of the
Act
, says as follows:
"I certify to this Honourable Court pursuant to subsection 37(1) of the
Canada Evidence Act
that the documents identified in Schedule 2 of the Hiltz affidavit contain information, including the taxpayers' names and details about them, the disclosure of which in this case would be prejudicial to the public interest, namely the disclosure would jeopardize the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the
Act
. I object to the disclosure of the redacted portions of the documents identified in Schedule 2 of the Hiltz affidavit on that ground. [see footnote 1]"
[15]
Notwithstanding the apparent concession by counsel for the Defendants in submissions made before the Federal Court of Appeal in
Harris No. 2
[see footnote 2] about an obligation to disclose an edited version of the documents listed in Schedule "2" of the Affidavit of Documents, the Defendants are in fact arguing for the continued non-disclosure of these documents on the basis of section 37(2) of the
Act
.
[16]
The Defendants take the position that if the relevancy of the taxpayer's identity is not established by the Plaintiff, then the redacted documents should not be disclosed. If the Plaintiff fails to establish the relevancy of the desired information, the Defendants say that the Court ought not embark upon the exercise of balancing the public interest in disclosure asserted by the Plaintiff, that is the proper administration of the
Income Tax Act
, against the specified public interest claimed by the Defendants, that is the public interest in ensuring that public confidence in the administration of the
Income Tax Act
, is maintained particularly in relation to the process of self-reporting of income for the purpose of tax assessment and in the provision of advance tax rulings are taxpayers who request them.
[17]
The Defendants filed an Amended Certificate under the
Act
setting out the grounds for specified public interest immunity. Here the Defendants rely primarily on protection of the privacy of the taxpayer as the basis of their claim of privilege. The Defendants also allege that certain documents listed in Schedule "2" are not relevant to this action because they relate to earlier requests for advance tax rulings which the Defendants claim are unrelated to the December 1991 ruling.
ISSUES
[18]
Several issues emerge from this motion. The first question, is whether the identity of the taxpayers is relevant to the conduct of this action. If so, the Court must determine whether that information is subject to the privilege of specified public interest asserted by the Defendants.
[19]
If the identity of the taxpayer is not relevant to this action, the second question is whether the redacted documents listed in Schedule "2" of the Affidavit of Documents is subject to specified public interest immunity and privileged against disclosure.
[20]
Third, should the confidentiality orders made on December 20, 2000 remain in effect?
ANALYSIS
[21]
The information sought is information over which the Crown asserts a privilege and by reason of that privilege, the Plaintiff has not had access to the taxpayer identity or related information in any of the proceedings to date.
[22]
As in my request for disclosure of information, as a preliminary matter, the Plaintiff must satisfy this Court that the information sought to be disclosed is relevant to his Statement of Claim. In other words, he must demonstrate that the taxpayer identity and any related information will assist him in proving the allegations he is attempting to prove.
[23]
The Statement of Claim alleges that an undue preference and special benefit were conferred upon the unidentified taxpayer as a result of the advance tax ruling issued on December 24, 1991. Paragraph 33 of the Statement of Claim provides as follows:
"By virtue of all of the foregoing conduct, the Crown bestowed an undue preference and special benefit on Protective Trust and Family Trust, whereas other trusts, and the class of Plaintiffs herein in general, were unaware of the favourable interpretation of the Act being applied by the Minister in such circumstances. The Plaintiff has a reasonable apprehension of bad faith administration and an ulterior motive on the part of the Crown in the circumstances of this case, and the Plaintiff reserves the right to amend his Claim with further particulars in this regard, after the filing of Affidavits as to Documents and the conduct of Examinations for Discovery."
[24]
As noted earlier, the Plaintiff specifically says in paragraph 22 of the Statement of Claim that disclosure of the personal or business affairs of any taxpayer is not necessary for the adjudication of his claim. I interpret "personal affairs" to include the identity of the taxpayer.
[25]
Furthermore, when the Plaintiff was cross-examined on the affidavit filed in support of the present motion, he confirmed that he was not alleging any wrong-doing on the part of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representatives. [see footnote 3]
[26]
The Plaintiff was questioned specifically about paragraph 14 of his supporting affidavit as follows:
"Q. Now, in paragraph 14, if you refer to that, please? In paragraph 14 of your affidavit you state,
'I believe that the taxpayer and representatives have knowledge of and could confirm that pressure was brought to bear on the Minister from persons outside Revenue Canada and by whom which lead to the reversal of the Department's considered position against a favourable ruling.'
Q. On what basis, Mr. Harris, do you make the statement in your affidavit that pressure was brought to bear on the Minister?
A. Well, there is in the documents a sequence of events in 1991 that take place, and there is an appearance in the sequence of events that there may have been some pressure to meet a deadline and so on. It is not very easy to figure out what was actually happening without, like you could go and talk to hundreds of people that potentially might have some knowledge, but the taxpayer and representatives would more quickly get to the core of the matter as to whether there was that pressure here. The word is,
'... confirm that pressure was brought to bear.'
There is an appearance in the flurry of activity in December, 1991, that there was some pressure to deal with it. And not having been privy to what went on behind the scenes, nor do I ask that I be privy to that, it is impossible to know whether there was pressure and whether the pressure was appropriate. [see footnote 4]"
[27]
The question of relevance has to be decided on the basis of the relationship between the information sought and the cause of action raised in the pleading. In
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the court said at paragraph 2:
"... after perusing the topics in issue, I have concluded that much of the information sought by way of further discovery cannot be considered as being discovery in respect of the facts which the Plaintiff relies on to establish its claim for damages ... As was stated by this court in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; (1976) 29 C.P.R.(2d) 284, the propriety of any question on discovery must be determined on the basis of its relevance to the facts pleaded in the statement of claim as constituting the cause of action rather than on its relevance to facts which the Plaintiff proposes to prove to establish the facts constituting its cause of action."
[28]
The Plaintiff has not alleged that the advance ruling in question was made on the basis of the identity of the taxpayer requesting it. If that allegation was squarely raised in the Statement of Claim, then the question of identity of the taxpayer would clearly be a matter raised in the pleadings and an issue requiring an answer. However, in the absence of a plea to that effect, in my opinion the preliminary objection raised by the Defendants must prevail.
[29]
As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Harris No. 2
, at paragraph 2, the issue in this action is the correctness of the ruling issued by the Minister. The original allegations raised in the Statement of Claim have not been amended. Discovery of a representative of the Defendants has taken place on the basis of the original Statement of Claim.
[30]
In the result, I must conclude that the Plaintiff has not shown that the identity of the taxpayer is relevant to the prosecution of his action. By extension I find that the identity of its professional advisor is likewise not relevant. The identity of the taxpayer and its advisors will not be disclosed.
[31]
The Defendants argue that the issue of public interest immunity is to be assessed in relation to the redacted documents and that in the absence of proof of relevancy of the taxpayer's identity to the conduct of this action, the redacted documents ought not to be disclosed to the counsel for the Plaintiff on the basis that even the redacted documents may tend to disclose the identity of the taxpayer, its advisors, and representatives.
[32]
However, my conclusion that the identity of the taxpayer is not relevant to the matters raised in the statement of claim does not mean that the redacted version of the documents described in Schedule "2" is immune from disclosure. Taxpayer identity is but one aspect of the documents in question and that information, by itself, can be protected. The claim of privilege in issue has been asserted by the Defendants in respect of a group of documents and will be assessed in relation to those documents.
[33]
Furthermore, in my opinion, the Defendants are proceeding upon a misapprehension of the purpose and effect of section 37(2) when they argue that the public interest immunity is to be assessed in relation to the redacted documents presented by the Defendants. The public interest immunity is to be assessed in relation to the original documents and redaction, if any, will be done by the court.
[34]
I refer to the decision of this court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where Rothstein, J. (as he then was), discussed the process to be followed when public interest immunity is sought pursuant to section 37(2) of the
Act
. At page 327  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  he said as follows:
"The jurisprudence of this Court has established a procedure to be followed in cases under subsections 37(2) and 38(1) of the
CEA
. By virtue of subsection 37(2), the court must be satisfied that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the importance of the specified public interest in confidentiality. The party seeking disclosure must first make out an 'apparent case' for disclosure before any documents are inspected. If the party seeking disclosure establishes an apparent case for disclosure, the court then proceeds to examine the documents in issue."
[35]
It is clear from these remarks that the burden lies upon the parties seeking disclosure to make an "apparent case" for disclosure prior to any inspection of documents by the Court. The learned justice went on to provide a list of factors to be considered in assessing whether an apparent case for disclosure has been established. The factors are as follows:
"(a) The nature of the public interest sought to be protected by confidentiality;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at pages 762 to 764;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at page 884;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at page 479.
"(b) Whether the evidence in question will 'probably establish a fact crucial to the defence';
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at page 238.
"(d) The admissibility of the documentation and the usefulness of it;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).
"(e) Whether the applicants have established that there are no other reasonable ways of obtaining the information;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  fishing expedition;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  concerning inspection of the documents since the documents were voluntarily submitted to the Court by the Defendants both in unedited and redacted forms. However, despite the voluntary delivery of these documents, the test referred to above requires me to consider whether a sufficient case of public interest in disclosure has been made out before I commence the exercise of balancing the two public interests at issue.
[37]
I propose to briefly express my opinion on the factors identified in
Khan
, supra, in assessing whether an "apparent case for disclosure" exists in the present case. On the first point, I find that there is a legitimate public interest in the protection of privacy in relation to taxpayers. However, the Federal Court of Appeal acknowledged in
Harris No. 2
, that the confidentiality of taxpayer information is not absolute.
[38]
I am also satisfied that the documents will "probably establish a fact crucial" to the Plaintiff's case. Disclosure of these documents will not amount to a general discovery. I make no comment on how those facts will be assesses by the trial judge.
[39]
The issue in this case relates to the manner in which the
Income Tax Act
was administered in December 1991 when the tax ruling in question was granted. In my opinion, the documents now in question are clearly relevant to that issue. While those documents may contain some information which is not relevant, that information can be redacted and the documents themselves made available. The documents presented, including material relating to the 1985 advance tax ruling, contain material which suggest that an arguable case can be made relative to the process by which the 1991 tax ruling was made and that the 1991 ruling was contrary to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).
[40]
Next, I accept that serious issues are involved in this case, that is the proper administration of the
Income Tax Act
. Having regard to the nature of the
Act
as one of general application for the purpose of raising funds for public expenditure and the allegations voiced in the Statement of Claim, there can be little serious debate about he gravity of the issues in this case.
[41]
As for the issues of the admissibility and usefulness of the documents, I refer again to the reasons in
Khan
, supra, at paragraphs 37 and 38, as follows:
"The considerations in previous
CEA
jurisprudence e.g., will the evidence in question 'probably establish a fact crucial to the defence' or whether the disclosure sought amounts to a general discovery or fishing expedition, indicate a standard of relevance similar to the 'likely relevance' standard set out in
O'Connor
, Lamer, C.J., and Sopinka, J., say in
O'Connor
that the 'likely relevance' test is a significant burden, but that it should not be interpreted as an onerous burden on the accused. It is to prevent speculative, unmeritorious and time consuming requests for production (paragraph 24 [at page 437]). Nonetheless, it is a higher test than that of usefulness to the defence as set out in
Egger
and
Chaplin
. The 'apparent case for disclosure' test as it has been expressed in
CEA
jurisprudence is also higher, and in that sense it is similar to the 'likely relevance' test in
O'Connor
. I am satisfied that the 'likely relevance' test in
O'Connor
is appropriate for the 'apparent case for disclosure' stage in proceedings under subsections 37(2) and 38(1) of the
CEA
.
"One condition specified in
CEA
jurisprudence for the 'apparent case for disclosure' stage is the admissibility of the documentation. In her reasons, L'Heureux-Dubé, J., for the majority in
O'Connor
, states at paragraphs 164 and 166 [at pages 507-508]:
'I cannot emphasize enough that the guidelines outlined above are clearly not synonymous with the test for admissibility of evidence at trial, outlined in
Seaboyer
and in s. 276 of the
Code
. Disclosure and production are broader concepts than admissibility and, as such, evidence which is produced to the defence will not necessarily be admissible at trial.
'In any event, the admissibility of the records as evidence must be determined if and when the accused seeks to introduce them. The fact that records have been ordered produced to the defence does not mean that the records are necessarily admissible.'"
[42]
I am satisfied that the factors of admissibility and usefulness are established in favour of the Plaintiff, notwithstanding the bare assertions by counsel for the Defendants that some of the Schedule "2" documents are inadmissible as evidence.
[43]
Counsel argued that the decision in issue was made by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue and suggested, without anything else, that the various notes and memoranda were inadmissible. The issue of admissibility of evidence at trial will be left to the trial judge. The threshold, at this stage, is lower.
[44]
It appears that, absent production of these documents by the Defendants, that there are no "other reasonable ways of obtaining the information". The documents in question are within the control of the Defendants. While some of the documents are also within the control of the taxpayer, that fact does not enter into the present assessment, in light of my findings on the issue of the taxpayer's identity.
[45]
Finally, with respect to the question whether production of the documents will amount to a general discovery or a fishing expedition, I repeat my earlier opinion that it will not. The term "fishing expedition" has been generally used to describe an indiscriminate request for production, in the hope of uncovering helpful information. In this regard, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 176 N.R. 68 (F.C.A.). However, I now refer to the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.C. 295 (F.C.A.) at page 313 [C.P.C.] when Marceau, J., suggests that the notion of a "fishing expedition" is to be weighed in terms of the reasonableness of the application for disclosure.
[46]
In my opinion, there is nothing unreasonable about the Plaintiff's request for disclosure of the Schedule "2" documents. Their production is rational in light of the serious allegations of impropriety raised by the Statement of Claim. It follows that, in my opinion, the Plaintiff has established an "apparent case" for disclosure of these documents, minus any information that may reveal the identity of the taxpayer.
[47]
Having found that the documents are relevant to the matters in issue in this action, I must now proceed to the second part of the test, that is the balancing of the two interests. On the other hand, there is the public interest in the proper administration of the
Income Tax Act
. On the other hand, there is the asserted specified public interest in maintenance of trust and confidence of taxpayers in the proper administration of the
Act
. The specified public interest has been described by the Defendants as follows:
"To gain the trust and cooperation of taxpayers generally, the CCRA must be able to obtain information about their personal and financial affairs in confidence and to protect this information from public disclosure. This is the specified public interest in this case. [see footnote 6]"
[48]
The Defendants have filed the amended certificate of Roy Shultis in support of the specified public interest. This amended certificate speaks at length about the purpose of advance income tax rulings. At paragraph 17, Mr. Shultis says as follows:
"The result of the above would be to undermine the purpose for which the income tax rulings service was established, namely to foster and encourage the self-assessment system and to contribute to good relations between the income tax administration and the tax-paying public. Taxpayers would be denied of the assurance of certainty prior to entering into a transaction and the guarantee of uniformity in the application of the income tax legislation. If taxpayers do not use the income tax rulings service, controversy about interpretation and litigation will increase and become more costly. In this event, the income tax rulings service will be less effective. This will have negative consequences on the administration and enforcement of the income tax system."
[49]
However, in my opinion Mr. Shultis and the Defendants are placing undue emphasis on only one part of the income tax system. As I have noted above, the purpose of the
Income Tax Act
is to produce revenue from taxes assessed against taxpayers. The assessment of taxes depends itself upon candour by taxpayers in reporting income and allowable expenses and deductions. The operation of the system depends on the candidness of all taxpayers and the availability of advance income tax rulings is but one aspect of that system.
[50]
I am not persuaded that the Defendants' submission about the so-called protection of candour in relation to one aspect of that system takes priority over the general proper administration of the law. After all, the propriety of the advance tax ruling is the issue in this action that has put in question the administration of the entire income tax system, not only the aspect of advance income tax rulings.
[51]
In my opinion, the public interest of confidence in that broader system, including respect for the confidentiality of taxpayer information and forthrightness in providing information for the purpose of the broader system must, in this case, override the specified further interest asserted by the Defendants. I refer to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 81, where La Forest, J., said as follows:
"There is further matter that militates in favour of disclosure of the documents in the present case. The appellant here alleges unconscionable behaviour on the part of government. As I see it, it is important that this question be aired not only in the interests of the administration of justice but also for the purpose for which it is sought to withhold the documents, namely, the proper functioning of the executive branch of government. For if there has been harsh or improper conduct in the dealings of the executive with the citizen, it ought to be revealed.
The purpose of secrecy in government is to promote its proper functioning, not to facilitate improper conduct by government
. This has been stated in relation to criminal accusations in
Whitlam
, and while the present case is of a civil nature, it is one where the behaviour of government is alleged to have been tainted." (emphasis added)
[52]
Accordingly, I conclude that the documents listed in Schedule "2" shall be disclosed, with the exception of certain documents which the Plaintiff concedes are privileged against disclosure. These documents are identified in the Plaintiff's Notice of Motion as documents 17, 21, 23, 24, 32 and 33 for which solicitor-client privilege is claimed.
[53]
Again, citing the protection of taxpayer identity, Mr. Shultis attempts to preclude the production of documents 1, 5-9, 11-13, 10, 14, 15 to 21, 22-30, and 32 to 35 because they purportedly relate to matters which are not relevant to the November 7, 1991 request for the advance income tax ruling giving rise to the litigation. Respectfully, I do not accept that argument.
[54]
In my opinion, the above-referenced documents are relevant to this action because they are part of the background of dealings between this taxpayer and the Department in connection with the 1991 ruling. Some documents were specifically mentioned by the Auditor General in his comments about the 1991 ruling. I am satisfied that these documents should be produced at this stage.
[55]
Turning to the remaining documents, that is documents 2-4, 31, 36-90, 94 and 95, the Defendants argue that they are not relevant to this action, even as redacted by the Defendants. As noted above, I disagree.
[56]
Insofar as the documents may identify the taxpayer or taxpayers who received the 1991 ruling, that information has been redacted by the Defendants, with the participation of the taxpayer. The identities of professional advisors, including lawyers and accountants have also been removed. These documents shall be released in redacted form, pending any further orders.
[57]
The final issue to be addressed is whether the confidentiality orders made on December 20, 2000 shall remain in effect.
[58]
In light of my conclusion respecting protection of the taxpayer's identity, including the identification of professional advisors working on behalf of the taxpayer, I see no reason to maintain those orders. The documents listed in Schedule "2" of the Defendants' Affidavit of Documents will be disclosed to the Plaintiff and his counsel, in the redacted form already provided by counsel for the Defendants. These documents do not presently constitute "evidence" but are provided as part of the pre-trial discovery process and will be treated as such, subject to the usual implied undertaking as to use only in connection with the purposes of this action.
Order accordingly.
