McNair, J.
: These are appeals from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue concerning the deductibility of certain items in the calculation of Gulf Canada Limited's base for depletion allowance, petroleum profits abatement and corporate surtax. The parties are agreed upon the amounts in issue; the dispute centres around the interpretation to be given to certain sections of the Income Tax Act, S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 63 as amended, governing the calculations in question, primarily s. 66.1(6)(a)(i) and ss. 124.1 and 124.2. The two actions, pertaining to reassessments of the plaintiff's income for the 1974 and 1975 taxation years respectively, were tried together on common evidence inasmuch as they are concerned with virtually identical issues.
[2]
The parties filed an agreed statement of facts wherein they outlined the central facts out of which three basic issues arise, and as well posed a series of questions for consideration by the court. For convenience, I will set out the facts under each of the three issues as well as the respective positions of the parties, and then return to an analysis of the evidence and argument under each respective heading.
[3]
By way of background, there were two budgets in 1974, one on May 6, which was reintroduced in substantially the same form on November 18, 1974. This resulted in the application of differing sets of statutory provisions, one pre-May 7, 1974, and one post-May 6, 1974, to which reference will be made from time to time hereafter. It is unnecessary to detail the assessments and notices of objection which underlie the present appeals. The parties themselves have clearly identified and set out the issues involved.
Issue No. 1: Lease Rental Payments To The Provincial Crown
[4]
In the 1974 and 1975 taxation years, Gulf made certain rental payments to the Crown in right of Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia for subsurface gas and oil rights. Gulf submits that these payments come within the definition of a "Canadian exploration expense" contained in s. 66.1 (6)(a) of the Act, and are thus to be included in the earned depletion base under s. 1205(a)(ii) of the Income Tax Regulations for purposes of the depletion allowance authorized by s. 65 of the Act.
[5]
The Minister takes the position that the lease rental payments constitute a "Canadian development expense", and are excluded from the earned depletion base by the operation of s. 1205 (a)(iii)(C) of the Regulations, which specifically excluded those "Canadian development expenses" referred to in s. 66.2(5)(a)(iii) of the Act as it then read.
[6]
For the 1974 taxation year I am concerned only with expenditures subsequent to May 6 in total amount of $1,626,867, which includes the sum of $25,772 for oil sands leases as a mineral resource. It will be recalled that this was the effective date of the amendments to the aforementioned statutory provisions. In 1975 the sum of $2,555,875 was paid out to the provincial Crowns in lease rental payments, of which $122,170 was paid in respect of oil sands leases. Gulf has reduced both of these figures by the agreed amount of 25 per cent in order to account for payments made in respect of producing leases. Thus, the amounts in issue are $1,220,150 for 1974, and $1,916,906 for 1975.
Issue No. 2: Scientific Research
[7]
This issue relates to Gulf's expenditures for scientific research in the following sectors from which no oil or gas was produced in either of the taxation years in question: geological research, heavy oil projects, special projects, payments to oil and gas research organizations, and Syncrude. The actual dispute is simply whether or not such payments should be included in the calculation of "taxable production profits" under ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act and "resource profits" under Part XII of the Regulations. These terms are crucial components in the computation of corporate surtax under s. 123.2(1) of the Act, the petroleum profits abatement under s. 124(2.1) of the Act, and the depletion allowance under s. 65(1) of the Act and Part XII of the Regulations.
[8]
In 1974, for purposes of computing its income for the year from upstream operations, Gulf treated its scientific research expenditures of $4,095,397 as being deductible pursuant to ss. 20(1) (t) and 37(1)(a) of the Act. This is not in issue. However, Gulf did not make similar deductions in calculating its "production profits" (pre-May 7, 1974) under Part XII of the Regulations and "taxable production profits" (post-May 6, 1974) under ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act. Gulf's position is that expenditures for scientific research which are unrelated to actual production in the sense of extraction of oil or natural gas form no part of the calculations under ss. 124.1 and 124.2.
[9]
The Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce subsequently approved $3,904,402 of the total amount which Gulf had claimed, as constituting scientific research expenditures under the Industrial Research and Development Incentive Act ("IRDIA"), R.S.C. 1970, c. I-10, which provided a system of grants for such expenditures. The Minister, in reassessing Gulf for the 1974 taxation year, accepted this classification on the basis that the definitions of scientific research in the IRDIA and the Income Tax Act are identical. Of the total amount of $3,904,402, $1,298,624 was attributable to the pre-May 7, 1974 period, and $2,605,778 was attributable to the post-May 6, 1974 period. The Minister did not deduct the scientific research expenditures in the amount of $1,298,624 in computing Gulf's "production profits" for the January 1 to May 6 period pursuant to Part XII of the Regulations (applicable to the pre-May 7, 1974 period). However, he did deduct this amount to determine the base for corporate surtax, pursuant to S.C. 1974-75, c. 26, s. 78 (2), for the post-May 6, 1974 period. The Minister also deducted the amount of $2,605,778 in computing Gulf's "taxable production profits" and "resource profits" pursuant to ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act and Part XII of the Regulations for the May 7 to December 31, 1974 period.
[10]
For the 1975 taxation year the issues remain basically the same. Gulf deducted the amount of $5,615,814 in scientific research expenditures in computing its income pursuant to ss. 20 (1)(t) and 37(1)(a) of the Act, and also deducted mineral development capital expenditures in the amount of $61,525 pursuant to ss. 20(1)(t) and 37(1)(b). The Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce approved $4,804,399 as constituting scientific research under the IRDIA definition, which was accepted by the Minister. The Minister deducted this amount in computing Gulf's resource profits under Part XII of the Regulations for the purposes of earned depletion allowance and in computing the base for the petroleum profits abatement. Gulf maintains that this amount should not be deducted, according to the wording of ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act and on the interpretation of "production" as meaning actual production.
Issue No. 3: Capital Cost Allowance
[11]
This issue concerns capital cost allowance claimed by Gulf with respect to assets purchased for Syncrude, a large project for the extraction of bituminous sands in Northern Alberta, of which Gulf was one of the participants. Syncrude was not in operation during the years 1974 and 1975, nor had construction been commenced.
[12]
There is no issue as to Gulf's deduction of capital cost allowance under s. 20(1)(a) of the Act in determining its world income. It is Gulf's submission, however, that such allowance ought not to be deducted in calculating pits "taxable production profits" for purposes of determining the corporate surtax, petroleum profits abatement and depletion allowance. Generally, this raises the same questions as to the interpretation of ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act that were raised under the previous heading, namely: whether deductions from income as calculated under these sections must be related to actual production or extraction from a mine or well, or whether the same deductions taken in the calculations of world income ought to be taken with respect to the determination of taxable production profits.
[13]
For the 1974 taxation year, the Minister included capital cost allowance in the amount of $3,126,542 for the post-May 6, 1974 period for purposes of determining the corporate surtax under s. 78(2) of the amending transitional provision enacted by S.C. 1974-75, c. 26. Section 78(2) refers to ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act. This issue is simply whether on the proper interpretation of these sections, capital cost allowance is deductible in the calculation of taxable production profits from mineral resources. This will affect the base for the corporate surtax, the petroleum profits abatement and the depletion allowance in a manner similar to the deduction of scientific research expenditures.
[14]
For the 1975 taxation year, Gulf deducted capital cost allowance in the amount of $21,556,788 in respect of Syncrude under s. 20(1)(a), and also deducted the same amount under ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act in computing its resource profits under s. 1204 of the Regulations for purposes of depletion allowance, as well as in the computation of taxable production profits for purposes of petroleum profits abatement and corporate surtax. Subsequently, Gulf reversed its position, contending that capital cost allowance should not be deducted under ss. 124.1 and 124.2. After a series of skirmishes by way of reassessments and objections, the Minister eventually permitted the deduction of capital cost allowance in the amount of $18,000,163 in respect of Syncrude (excluding scientific research) pursuant to s. 20(1)(a) of the Act. The Minister also recognized the deduction of the same amount in the computation of Gulf's resource profits and taxable production profits, which Gulf disputes. To recapitulate, the amount of $17,790,909 of Gulf's 1975 capital cost allowance deduction of $18,061,688 in relation to Syncrude, including $61,525 for scientific research, was related to assets described in Class 28 of Schedule B to the Regulations.
Questions Posed For The Court
"1. Do Provincial Crown lease rental expenses incurred by Gulf in its 1974 and 1975 taxation years constitute 'Canadian exploration expenses' as defined in subparagraphs 66.1(6)(a) (i) or (iii) of the Income Tax Act, for the purpose of inclusion in the earned depletion base as defined in Regulation 1205 of the Act?
"2. Are the amounts deducted by Gulf in its 1974 (post May 6) and 1975 taxation years for upstream scientific research deductible in the computation of Gulf's 'taxable production profits from oil or gas wells in Canada'/'taxable production profits from mineral resources in Canada', as defined in subsections 124.2(1) and 124.1(1) of the Act, for the purposes of determining its:
(1) 'resource profits' under Part XII of the Income Tax Regulations (applicable after May 6, 1974), to enable the computation of its depletion deduction under Regulation 1201 and section 65 of the Act?
(2) petroleum profits abatement under subsection 124(2.1) of the Act; and
(3) exemption from the base for corporation surtax under subsection 123.2(1) of the Act?
"3. Is the amount deducted by Gulf in the 1974 taxation year in respect of upstream scientific research expenditures in the pre-May 7, 1974 period deductible under subsection 78(2), c. 26 S.C. 1974-75 in the computation of the exemption from the base for corporate surtax under subsection 123.2 (1) of the Act?
"4. Is the mineral development capital cost allowance deducted by Gulf in the 1974 taxation year in respect of the post May 6, 1974 period deductible under subsection 78(2), c. 26, S.C. 1974-75 in the computation of the exemption from the base for corporate surtax under subsection 123.2 (1) of the Act?
"5. Is the amount of Gulf's capital cost allowance deduction for the 1975 taxation year in respect of assets located at Syncrude deductible in the computation of Gulf's 'taxable production profits from mineral resources in Canada'/'taxable production profits from oil or gas wells in Canada', as defined in subsections 124.1(1) and 124.2(1) of the Act, for the purposes of determining its:
(1) 'resource profits' under Part XII of the Income Tax Regulations (applicable after May 6, 1974), to enable the computation of its depletion deduction under Regulation 1201 and section 65 of the Act;
(2) petroleum profits abatement under subsection 124(2.1) of the Act; and,
(3) exemption from the base for corporation surtax under subsection 123.2(1) of the Act?"
Lease Rental Payments
[15]
Section 65(1) of the Income Tax Act authorizes a depletion allowance in addition to the normal deductions of expenses in computing income. This additional allowance is permitted in respect of oil and gas wells and mineral resources, and is defined in Part XII of the Regulations. Under s. 1201 of the Regulations, as amended by SOR/ 75-342, the taxpayer is authorized to deduct the lesser of:
"(a) 25% of the amount if any, by which his resource profits for the year exceed four times the aggregate of amounts, if any, deductible under subsections 1202(2) and (3) in computing his income for the year, and
"(b) his earned depletion base as of the end of the year (before making any deduction under this section for the year)."
[16]
The present case, as I see it, is governed by s. 1201(b) of the Regulations relating to earned depletion base, which in turn is defined in s. 1205 of the Regulations. The relevant portions of s. 1205 read as follows:
"1205. For the purposes of this Part 'earned depletion base' of a taxpayer as of a particular time means the amount by which 33 1/3% of the aggregate of
(a) all expenditures ... each of which was incurred by him after November 7, 1969 and before the particular time and each of which
. . . . .
(ii) was a Canadian exploration expense ...
(iii) was a Canadian development expense other than ...
. . . . .
(C) an amount referred to in subparagraph 66.2(5)(a)(iii) of the Act, ..."
[17]
The definition of "Canadian exploration expense" is set out in s. 66.1(6)(a) of the Act as follows:
"'Canadian exploration expense' of a taxpayer means any outlay or expense made or incurred, or deemed to have been made or incurred, after May 6, 1974 that is
(i) any expense including a gelogical, geophysical or geochemical expense incurred by him (other than an expense referred to in subparagraph (ii)) for the purpose of determining the existence, location, extent or quality of an accumulation of petroleum or natural gas (other than a mineral resource) in Canada,
. . . . .
(iii) any expense incurred by him for the purpose of determining the existence, location, extent or quality of a mineral resource in Canada including any expense incurred in the course of
(A) prospecting,
(B) carrying out geological, geophysical or geochemical surveys,
(C) drilling by rotary, diamond, percussion or other methods, or
(D) trenching, digging test pits and preliminary sampling,
but not including
(E) any Canadian development expense, or
(F) any expense that may reasonably be considered to be related to a mine, whether or not owned by the taxpayer, that has come into production in reasonable commercial quantities or to be related to a potential or actual extension thereof, ..."
[18]
It is Gulf's submission that what it refers to as "exploration lease rental payments" come within the broad definition of a "Canadian exploration expense" in ss. 66.1(6)(a)(i) and (iii), as expenses incurred "for the purpose of determining the existence, location, extent or quality" of an accumulation of petroleum or natural gas or of a mineral resource.
[19]
Gulf in an integrated oil company, carrying on work associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas and related hydrocarbons, or what is frequently referred to as the "upstream sector", together with the commercial activity involved in the refining and marketing of those products, or what is described as the "downstream sector". The company has a combined exploration and production department. The exploration group, in seeking out possible development sites, is responsible for gathering information, performing seismic work, undertaking economic studies and determining whether to acquire subsurface rights in order that exploratory wells may be drilled. The evidence indicates that very few of these wells actually go into commercial production.
[20]
The three provinces in question grant subsurface rights by way of reservation, permit, licence or lease. The first three of these means of conveyance, namely, reservation, permit and licence, authorize exploration work only. It is only under a lease agreement that actual production, in the narrow sense of the extraction of oil and gas from the ground for marketing, is permissible. The payments under each of these types of agreement are generally referred to as "lease rental payments".
[21]
Gulf argues that the payments to acquire these rights are an integral part of the exploration process and therefore ought to be included in their earned depletion base as a Canadian exploration expense. The point is pressed that if these payments were not made for the acquisition of subsurface rights, no exploratory work could be performed. Because it is Gulf's position that the deduction is only applicable to nonproducing, exploratory leases, it has seen fit to reduce its claim for these payments by 25 per cent, as reflected in the agreed statement of facts. However, Gulf was unable to break down its lease rental payments to reflect the actual year of the respective lease agreements because its acreage inventory was constantly changing.
[22]
The defendant takes the position that these payments are not eligible for deduction because they fall within the definition of a "Canadian development expense" contained in s. 66.2 (5)(a) of the Act, as it read at the relevant time, and more specifically within subparagraph (iii) thereof. Thus, they are excluded from the definition of "earned depletion base" by virtue of s. 1205 (a)(iii)(C) of the Regulations. Section 66.2(5)(a), enacted by S.C. 1974-75, c. 26, s. 36(1), as amended by S.C. 1977- 78, c. 1, s. 31(2), reads as follows:
"'Canadian development expense' of a taxpayer means any outlay or expense made or incurred, or deemed to have been made or incurred, after May 6, 1974 that is
. . . . .
(iii) notwithstanding paragraph 18 (l)(m), the cost to him of a Canadian resource property, ... but not including any payment made to any of the persons referred to in any of subparagraphs 18(l)(m)(i) to (iii) for the preservation of a taxpayer's rights in respect of a Canadian resource property or a property that would have been a Canadian resource property if it had been acquired by the taxpayer after 1971, and not including a payment ... to which paragraph 18(l)(m) applied by virtue of subparagraph (v) thereof, ..."
[23]
Section 18(l)(m) of the Act prohibits deductions being made for certain royalty payments, and subparagraph (i) thereof makes specific reference to Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province. "Canadian resource property" is defined in s. 66(15)(c) of the Act, as amended by S.C. 1974-75, c. 26, s. 35(21), as follows:
"'Canadian resource property' of a taxpayer means any property acquired by him after 1971 that is,
(i) any right, licence or privilege to explore for, drill for, or take petroleum, natural gas or other related hydrocarbons in Canada,
(ii) any right, licence or privilege to prospect, explore, drill, or mine for, minerals in a mineral resource in Canada,
(iii) any oil or gas well situated in Canada,
(iv) any rental or royalty computed by reference to the amount or value of production from an oil or gas well, or a mineral resource, situated in Canada,
(v) any real property situated in Canada the principal value of which depends upon its mineral resource content (but not including any depreciable property situated on the surface of the property or used or to be used in connection with the extraction or removal of minerals therefrom), or
(vi) any right to or interest in any property (other than property of a trust) described in any of subparagraphs (i) to (v) (including a right to receive proceeds of disposition in respect of a disposition thereof);"
[24]
If I apprehend the defendant's argument correctly, the point is that the lease rental payments were not made for the actual carrying out of exploration within the meaning of a Canadian exploration expense, but rather were payments for maintaining or preserving the right to carry out such activities, and therefore fall squarely within the terms of s. 66.2(5)(a)(iii) of the Act. As such, they are Canadian development expenses, which by virtue of s. 1205 (a)(iii)(C) of the Regulations do not constitute a part of the "earned depletion base". A similar position was taken by the Federal Court, Trial Division in New  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (upheld by a majority decision of the Federal Court of Appeal on divided grounds 15 N.R. 508; 77 D.T.C. 5202), with respect to former s. 83A of the Act. In that case, Mahoney, J., at trial, found that payments for leases to drill and explore, including the right to take oil and gas, did not constitute drilling and exploration expenses under s. 83A and were consequently not deductible inasmuch as they were payments for the right to drill and explore, and not for expenses incurred in drilling or exploring. The defendant submits, in what I perceive as an alternative argument, that the specific exclusion contained in s. 1205 (a)(iii)(C) of the Regulations overrides the wording of a Canadian exploration expense contained in s. 66.1 (6)(a) of the Act.
[25]
Leases are entered into by Gulf for purposes both of the exploration and development stages, and the provincial statutes of the three western provinces authorizing the payments as well as the "lease" agreements themselves recognize that the payments are for the subsurface rights as opposed to payments for production. In short, these rights are acquired for purposes of the entire upstream sector of the business. Defendant's counsel cites  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.T.C. 6526 (F.C.A.), and submits that payments to maintain an acreage inventory, upon which both exploration and development may or may not take place, do not constitute the type of primary exploratory expenses which are contemplated by s. 66.1(6)(a)(i). In Edmonton Gas, test wells were drilled not for purposes of exploration, but for actual production. However, the wells turned out to be "dry wells", and the question before the court was whether the costs of drilling these wells constituted exploration expenses within the meaning of s. 66.1(6)(a)(i). The court held that they did not on the ground that this subparagraph was limited to expenses of a "primary exploratory type" (per MacGuigan, J., at 6530).
[26]
As I interpret the definition of "Canadian resource property" in s. 66 (15)(c) of the Act, there is no question that the annual lease rental payments made by Gulf to the Crown were to acquire or maintain rights in property falling within this definition. Furthermore, these payments were made to the provincial Crown, and are therefore excluded from the definition of "Canadian exploration expense" in s. 66.2 (5)(a)(iii). Consequently, I am of the view that they cannot be included in the earned depletion base under s. 1205 of the Regulations.
[27]
Based on budget speeches made at the time of the 1974 amendments, counsel for the plaintiff advances the proposition that the purpose of the exclusions in s. 18(l)(m) of the Act was to avoid erosion of the federal tax base by no longer recognizing royalties and like payments made to the provincial Crowns as a deduction in computing income. Prior to these amendments, royalties payable to the Crown were deductible in determining income. However, as a result of increasing production, the provincial governments were increasing their revenues by increased royalty payments. The consequent erosion of the federal tax base was halted by making such payments nondeductible. It is also clear from both the provisions themselves as well as the budget speeches that the government was attempting to encourage exploration through use of the earned depletion base. Formerly, the depletion allowance was not predicated on an "earned" base.
[28]
Budget speeches and similar sources are useful in indicating the "mischief" or condition at which the legislature was directing its attention:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.T.C. 5310, at 5314 (F.C.A.), per MacGuigan, J. Nevertheless, in view of the clear wording of the statutory provisions, I do not find the excerpts helpful in interpreting the language used. This is particularly so in view of the fact that both parties were able to cite the speeches in support of their own positions. As well, budget speeches are not intended as comprehensive and technical aids to interpretation.
[29]
Section 1205(a)(iii)(C) of the Regulations excludes amounts "referred to" in s. 66.2(5)(a)(iii) of the Act. Thus, I have no hesitation in concluding that the lease rental payments by Gulf to the provincial Crowns are amounts referred to in that regulatory provision. Although the intent of s. 18 (l)(m) of the Act may have been to exclude royalty payments rather than lease rentals, the language employed in s. 66.2(5)(a)(iii) does not differentiate between the two. Rather, the subparagraph simply refers to "payments made to any of the persons referred to in any of subparagraphs 18(l)(m)(i) to (iii) for the preservation of a taxpayer's rights in respect of a Canadian resource property" (my emphasis). It does not limit itself to royalty payments as does s. 18, nor am I willing to read in any such limitation in view of the clear wording referring to payments made to preserve rights in Canadian resource property.
[30]
Plaintiff's counsel relied particularly on the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.), to support his client's position that these annual payments constituted Canadian exploration expenses. I must say with all due respect that I do not find that case to be illuminative of the point in issue. Thorson, P. was dealing there with the deductibility of "building and exploration costs", including "all general geological and geophysical expenses incurred by [the taxpayer] directly or indirectly, on or in respect of exploring or drilling for oil and natural gas in Canada" under s. 53(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act, 1949. A restriction was imposed by subsection (2A) thereof, which stated that in computing such deduction "no amount shall be included in respect of a payment for or in respect of a right, license or privilege to explore for, drill for or take petroleum or natural gas other than an annual payment not exceeding $1.00 per acre". The learned President held that this did not permit the plaintiffs to deduct one-time fees and bonus costs, stating in this context at p. 1311:
"... It is also clear that the land costs for which the appellant made the payments referred to are within the ambit of the term 'exploration costs' in subsection (1)."
It is not clear that the definition of such payments was at issue in the Western Leaseholds case, and I do not take it to be determinative of the issue at hand. The definition of a Canadian development expense now makes specific reference to such payments; they are no longer referred to under the definition of Canadian exploration expense.
[31]
I agree with the Minister's contention that the specific exclusion in s. 1205 of the Regulations of payments referred to in s. 66.2(5)(a)(iii) of the Act overrides the general wording contained in the definition of a Canadian exploration expense in s. 66.1(6) (a).
[32]
Support for this view may also be found in the legislative history behind "Canadian exploration and development expenses", as defined in s. 66(15)(b) of the Act. Former s. 83A, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, permitted the deduction of drilling and exploration expenses. Section (8e) was added in 1965 to include in such expenses annual payments made for the preservation of a right (S.C. 1965, c. 18, s. 20(6)). In the 1972 Act, these annual payments became part of "drilling or exploration expenses" as defined in s. 66(15)(d) and, by virtue thereof, were incorporated in the definition of "Canadian exploration and development expenses" in s. 66(15)(b). The definition of "Canadian resource property" in s. 66(15)(c) was added at the same time, including subparagraph (i), "any right, licence or privilege to explore for, drill for, or take petroleum, natural gas or other related hydrocarbons in Canada". "Canadian exploration expense" and "Canadian development expense" were split into two separate categories effective May 6, 1974 by virtue of s. 66.1(6)(a) and 66.2(5)(a) respectively. Moreover, s. 66.2(5)(a)(iii) established that "the cost ... of a Canadian resource property" fell under the definition of "Canadian development expense" (S.C. 1976-77, c. 4, s. 25(2)).
Scientific Research
[33]
Plaintiff's counsel makes two basic arguments concerning Gulf's expenditures for scientific research in the 1974 and 1975 taxation years. First, he submits that since the Minister accepted that the expenditures in question constituted "scientific research", as approved under IRDIA, they cannot reasonably be regarded as being related to production, as required under ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act. As indicated, the IRDIA definition of scientific research is the same as that contained in s. 2900 of the Regulations, which reads as follows:
"2900. For the purpose of paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section 72 [s. 37(7)] of the Act, 'scientific research' means systematic investigation or search carried out in a field of science or technology by means of experiment or analysis, that is to say,
(a) basic research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge without a specific practical application in view,
(b) applied research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge with a specific practical application in view, and
(c) development, namely, use of the results of basic or applied research for the purpose of creating new, or improving existing, materials, devices, products or processes,
and, where such activities are undertaken directly in support of activities described in paragraph (a), (b), or (c), includes activities with respect to engineering or design, operations research, mathematical analysis or computer programming and psychological research, but does not include activities with respect to
. . . . .
(g) prospecting, exploring or drilling for or producing minerals, petroleum or natural gas, ..."
[34]
From the plaintiff's standpoint, s. 2900 of the Regulations is a key provision, insofar as paragraph (g) excludes from the meaning of "scientific research" activities with respect to producing minerals, petroleum or natural gas. Having accepted an amount as "scientific research" under this definition, counsel strenuously contends that the Minister cannot suddenly contradict himself by assessing the taxpayer on the basis that the amount is related to the production of petroleum or natural gas.
[35]
The second main argument of plaintiff's counsel is simply that the research to which the payments related was long-term in the sense of not being directly related to production as required by ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act, but rather as being aimed at improving the future business of the company. Counsel submits that the "production" referred to in these sections requires actual extraction from producing wells for sale on world markets. In his submission, there was no production in this sense from any of the sectors to which the scientific research payments in question relate. In support of this argument, plaintiff's counsel relied particularly on the cases of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.), (affing 4 N.R. 451; 74 D.T.C. 6382 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).
[36]
Counsel for the defendant takes the position that the references to "production" in ss. 124.1 and 124.2 comprehend the entire upstream sector of Gulf's business, including exploration, development and production in the sense of extraction, as opposed to the downstream or marketing sector of the business. He maintains that the structures of the industry and of the plaintiff's operations support this division. In his submission, the scientific research in issue was related to improving production in this broad sense.
[37]
Defendant's counsel relied extensively on expert evidence to support his argument that the scientific research payments were treated by Gulf in its financial statements in a manner consistent with industry practice and with generally accepted accounting principles in that they were deducted from income produced from the entire upstream sector, with no differentiation being made between exploration and production.
[38]
The relevant provisions of ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act (now repealed) read as follows:
"124.1(1) For the purposes of this Part, 'taxable production profits from mineral resources in Canada' of a corporation for a taxation year means the amount, if any, by which the aggregate of
(a) where the corporation has production from a mineral resource in Canada operated by it, the amount, if any, included in computing its income for the year by virtue of subsection 59(2.1) and paragraphs 59(3.2)(b) and (c), less any deduction allowed in computing its income by virtue of subsection 64 (1.1), and
(b) the amount, if any, of the aggregate of its incomes for the year from
(i) the production in Canada of
(A) petroleum, natural gas or related hydrocarbons, or
(B) metals or minerals to any stage that is not beyond the prime metal stage or its equivalent,
from mineral resources in Canada operated by it,
(ii) the processing in Canada of ores from mineral resources in Canada not operated by it to any stage that is not beyond the prime metal stage or its equivalent, and
(iii) a rental or royalty, the amount of which is computed by reference to the amount or value of production from a mineral resource in Canada,
exceeds
(c) the aggregate of its losses for the year from those sources, computed in accordance with this Act, on the assumption that it had during the taxation year no incomes or losses except from those sources and was allowed no deductions in computing its income for the taxation year other than
. . . . .
(v) such other deductions as may reasonably be regarded as applicable to the sources of income described in any of subparagraphs (b)(i), (ii) and (iii).
"124.2(1) For the purposes of this Part, 'taxable production profits from oil or gas wells in Canada' of a corporation for a taxation year means the amount, if any, by which the aggregate of
(a) where no amount is included in computing the taxable production profits from mineral resources in Canada of the corporation by virtue of paragraph 124.1(1)(a) and the corporation has production from an oil or gas well in Canada operated by it, the amount, if any, included in computing its income for the year by virtue of subsection 59 (2.1) and paragraphs 59(3.2)(b) and (c), less any deduction allowed in computing its income by virtue of subsection 64(1.1), and
(b) the amount, if any, of the aggregate of its incomes for the year from
(i) the production of petroleum, natural gas or related hydrocarbons from oil or gas wells in Canada operated by it, and
(ii) rentals or royalties, the amounts of which are computed by reference to the amount or value of production from oil or gas wells in Canada,
exceeds
(c) the aggregate of its losses for the year from those sources, computed in accordance with this Act, on the assumption that it had during the taxation year no incomes or losses except from those sources, and was allowed no deductions in computing its income for the taxation year other than
. . . . .
(ii) the amount, if any, by which the aggregate of the losses referred to in paragraph 124.1(1) (c) exceeds the aggregate of the incomes referred to in paragraph 124.1(1)(a) and (b)
(v) such other deductions as may reasonably be regarded as applicable to the sources of income described in subparagraphs (b)(i) and (ii)."
[39]
These sections provide a means for a separate calculation of an amount known as "taxable production profits", used as an essential component in the calculation of certain special abatements, namely, petroleum profits abatement, depletion allowance and the base for corporate surtax.
[40]
Counsel for the defendant relied on the texts of the 1974 budget speeches with a view to explaining the purpose behind the incentive programs for which ss. 124.1 and 124.2 were designed. While the 1974 budget set the basic rate of corporate tax at 50 per cent, certain allowances were to be given to corporations with resource income in order to reduce the effective rate of tax. Furthermore, separate treatment was to be given to income from oil and gas wells as opposed to income from mineral resources. Defendant's counsel makes the point that if Gulf's scientific research expenditures are not deducted under ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act in the calculation of "taxable production profits", while at the same time being deducted under ss. 20 and 37, the effect will be far larger abatements than would be the case if the base for the abatements was calculated on the same basis as the basic federal tax. According to defendant's counsel, this would mean that the purpose of the incentives will be exceeded to the extent that the abatements will be extended to far more than just resource income.
[41]
Plaintiff's counsel counters with the rejoinder that this result is not illogical, given the fact that the purpose of the "taxable production profits" calculation is to serve as a base for a tax incentive program. In support of this proposition, counsel points to the reasoning of Jackett, C.J., in the International Nickel case, supra, at p. 6386. In the alternative, plaintiff's counsel proffered a different explanation of the purpose of the tax incentive amendments. Without elaborating, his explanation was that Parliament intended to allow for the taxation of petroleum and natural gas production by provincial governments, while at the same time making the payment of those taxes nondeductible under the Income Tax Act, in order to prevent the erosion of the federal tax base by rising provincial rates of taxation. To accomplish its legislative objective, Parliament set up a scheme isolating and permitting abatements in respect of "production", which corresponded to the activity taxed by provincial governments through royalites on actual production.
[42]
Defendant's counsel submitted that the sourcing requirement under s. 4 of the Act ought to be read into ss. 124.1 and 124.2 on the basis that the language of these sections refers to the "aggregate of its incomes", thus implying that the "income from source" rules in ss. 3 and 4 of the Act should apply to the calculations thereunder. Plaintiff's counsel submits, contra, that the wording of ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act makes is abundantly clear that the "sources of income" referred to therein are attributable to "production", rather than "business". In his submission, these sections establish a separate scheme for the calculation of this special-purpose tax base.
[43]
I am satisfied to accept the submissions of plaintiff's counsel on this issue, namely, that ss. 124.1 and 124.2 are much more specific in their scope and intendment than the calculation of income provisions under s. 3 of the Act, in requiring that the income and deductions be related to production in the sense of extraction from the ground as the source of income. In my opinion, the scientific research expenditures in issue, being related to the long-term objectives of the plaintiff and not to the actual present production from mineral resources, ought not to be included in the calculations. I am buttressed in this conclusion by the three cases relied on by the plaintiff.
[44]
In International Nickel, supra, the Minister sought to deduct long-term scientific research expenditures in the computation of depletion allowance under s. 1201 of the Regulations with respect to "profits ... reasonably attributable to the production of oil, gas, prime metals or industrial minerals from ... resources operated by [the taxpayer]". The taxpayer argued that these expenditures were not properly deductible in computing its depletion base under the Regulations since they were of a capital nature and ought not to be deducted in the calculation of "profits". The taxpayer further argued that these expenditures were not related to the production of prime metals as required by s. 1201 of the Regulations. The Federal Court, Trial Division, allowed the taxpayer's appeal based on the argument that the expenses were of a capital nature. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the Minister's appeal, but on different grounds. Essentially, the appellate court held that long-term scientific expenditures were not related to production as required under the Regulations. The court chose to view them instead as part of a separate operation designed for ensuring the future success of the business, and not as expenses incurred in the production of prime metal. Jackett, C.J., considered the scheme of allocating income to a source with reference to the computation of the depletion base, and concluded at pp. 6386 to 6387:
"... Regulation 1201 does not, however, adopt such a scheme. It provides for a calculation of profit reasonably attributable to the particular activity and, by Regulation 1201(4) enumerates what is to be deducted from the profit so calculated. Moreover, while that enumeration specifically singles out such amounts as capital cost allowance (depreciation) and interest on borrowed money for deduction from gross profit in computing the depletion base, it does not require deduction in that computation of the research expenses that are deductible in computing income by virtue of section 11(l)(j) and section 72. In the face of such a very precise formula adopted under statutory authority for the specific purpose of computing the depletion base, I am of the view that it is not open to the Courts to read into the statutory formula any unspecified deduction that might seem to be dictated by policy considerations."
In my view, this statement is equally applicable to the Crown's submission in the present case. Incidentally, the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in International Nickel was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada.
[45]
In Cominco Ltd., supra, the question before the court was whether business interruption insurance payable in respect of a fire at the plaintiff's zinc ore processing plant could be characterized as production profits from its mineral processing operation, and therefore allowable as a deduction by virtue of the combined effect of ss. 65(1) and 124.1(1) of the Act and s. 1201 of the Regulations. The plaintiff argued that the insurance proceeds should be treated for tax purposes in a manner identical to the assumed earnings for which the proceeds were a replacement. The Minister argued, on the other hand, that in order to qualify for the allowances in question, the taxpayer had to fulfil the literal requirements of the Regulations. He further argued "that the allowance provided for by the Regulations comes into existence only when there has been production (or a processing) of minerals as required by the Regulations". The court held that the defendant's position was the correct one on the grounds that the insurance proceeds should be treated as general revenue within the breadth of s. 3 of the Act and should not be brought within the much more specific wording of s. 1201 of the Regulations, where there is production profits or resource profits. Reed, J., made the following significant comment at p. 6538:
"The fact that the plaintiff treated the proceeds as 'mineral income', in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is not a weighty consideration in this case. Reference can be made to the Supreme Court decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , for an illustration of the principle that a taxpayer's accounting practices, or even the generally accepted accounting principles, are not controlling in the face of the express wording of the Act."
An appeal of this decision was dismissed (A-1324-84, December 2, 1985), and leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused, [1986] 1 S.C.R. vii.
[46]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  deal, went to the amount of depletion allowance the taxpayer was entitled to deduct, pursuant to s. 11(1)(b) of the Act and ss. 1200 and 1201 of the Regulations. The parties adduced expert opinion evidence as to the meaning of "production". Notwithstanding the helpful opinion evidence, the trial judge wisely perceived his problem as being "to determine what the legislators meant by the words 'profits reasonably attributable to the production ...', as they appear in s. 1202(2)(a) of the Regulations". The plaintiff's action was dismissed. On the first issue, the court concluded that production of gas by Texaco ceased at the well-head, i.e. at the upstream side of any separator, be it a field separator or an inlet separator, in the plaintiff's gas plants. The matter was referred back to the Minister for reassessment accordingly. Collier, J., gave the following definition of "production" in terms of oil or gas at p. 5293:
"In my opinion, the 'production of oil [or] gas', in this suit, means the bringing forth, or into existence and human realization, from underground, a basic substance containing gas, and at the same time, other matter. Whether it is basically oil or basically gas that is discovered and brought forth, or whether it is an oil well as distinguished from a gas well, is, I think, perhaps a matter of measurement, or the bestowing of a sensible appellation on the particular substance (be it energy, or fuel, or something else) or source, which, or from which, the substance is recovered in the largest relative volume."
[47]
In light of these cases, I am unable to agree with the submission of defendant's counsel that income under ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act must be computed in accordance with the concept of the source principle. As I read these sections, contrary to what defendant's counsel suggests, the calculation of taxable production profits is independent of the calculation of income for purposes of s. 3 of the Act. In my opinion, ss. 124.1 and 124.2 set up their own separate scheme of inclusions and exclusions from income for purposes of the special incentive programs.
Capital Cost Allowance
[48]
I consider that the same arguments applicable to scientific research expenditures also apply to the deductibility of capital cost allowance for Syncrude assets under ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act. Plaintiff's counsel made the additional argument that under former s. 1201 of the Regulations, capital cost allowance was specifically mentioned as a deduction from the base used for the calculation of depletion allowance and that, consequent upon the amendments of the Act and Regulations, this deduction was removed. Counsel submitted that this was consistent with the intent of the statutory amendments.
[49]
I conclude therefore, consistent with my conclusions regarding the scientific research deduction issue that the calculation of "taxable production profits" in ss. 124.1 and 124.2 of the Act is referable to production in the narrow sense of the term. It is common ground between the parties that there was no actual production in the taxation years in question. Hence, there can be no deduction of capital cost allowance under these sections, as I see it.
Conclusion
[50]
I am of the opinion, therefore, that the answers to the questions posed must be "no" in each case, and the matter is referred back to the Minister for reassessment on that basis and in accordance with these reasons for judgment. In the result, the plaintiff's appeal with respect to the first issue is dismissed, but is allowed on the two remaining issues. The plaintiff was substantially successful in the actions and is entitled to its taxable costs thereof on the basis of one set of costs only, but reduced by one-third. Judgment will go accordingly.
Appeals allowed in part.
