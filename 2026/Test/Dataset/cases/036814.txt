Reed, J.
: The applicant seeks orders quashing two decisions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission ("the Commission"). Those decisions sent two complaints, those of Tim Reed and David Vincer, to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ("the Tribunal") for a full inquiry. A similar decision was made in the case of a Mr. Philibert. It has been agreed that the disposition of the present applications will govern the Philibert decision as well.
[2]
The complaints of Reed and Vincer relate to the provisions of the
Family Allowances Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-1, and the
Family Allowances Regulations
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 642 as amended. It is alleged that the refusal by the Department of Health and Welfare ("the Department") to make family allowance cheques payable to the complainants discriminated against them on the basis of sex.
[3]
Section 7(1) of the
Family Allowances Act
[see footnote 1] provided that the family allowance benefits payable in respect of a child (approximately $33 per month in 1991) would be paid to the female parent except where the
Regulations
provided otherwise. By 1989 the
Regulations
provided that the cheques would be payable to the male parent if he had custody of the child or if there was an agreement by both parents that the cheques should be so paid or if the Minister had determined that special circumstances or reasonable cause rendered payment to the male parent necessary [see footnote 2]. The payment of family allowance benefits was discontinued effective January 1, 1993. It was replaced by a child tax credit system. This change was announced by the government on February 25, 1992. The relevant legislation (Bill C-80) was introduced on May 13, 1992 and received royal assent on October 15, 1992.
[4]
The complaints of Reed and Vincer were referred by the Commission to the Tribunal on June 15, 1992, and July 24, 1992, respectively. The complaint of Mr. Reed had been filed with the Commission on January 8, 1990, that of Mr. Vincer on June 24, 1987. The referral of these complaints to the Tribunal, by the Commission, was made pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) and s. 49 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6:
"44(3) On receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission
(a) may request the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel to appoint a Human Rights Tribunal in accordance with s. 49 to inquire into the complaint to which the report relates
if the Commission is satisfied
(i)
that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted, and
(ii) that the complaint to which the report relates should not be referred pursuant to subsection (2) or dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e); or
"49(1) The Commission may, at any stage after the filing of a complaint, request the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel to appoint a Human Rights Tribunal, in this Part referred to as a 'Tribunal', to inquire into the complaint
if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted
.
"(1.1) On receipt of a request under subsection (1), the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel
shall appoint
a Tribunal to inquire into the complaint to which the request relates." (underlining added)
[5]
In the particular circumstances of these cases, the applicant argues that the decision of the Commission to refer the complaints to the Tribunal was: (1) made without regard to the rules of natural justice, particularly the doctrine of legitimate expectations, and (2) were unreasonable. One circumstance relied upon for this argument is the fact that the Commission, in 1986-89, approved a settlement with the Department, which covered the fact situations raised in the Reed and Vincer cases. The Department relied upon that settlement in dealing with subsequent claims. Another circumstance is that, as has already been noted, a decision to discontinue family allowance benefits had been taken by the government some considerable time before the decision by the Commission to mount a full scale enquiry by the Tribunal was made. Thus, the results of any enquiry could have no impact on the general operation of the now defunct family allowance benefits scheme.
The 1986 (Ozorak) Settlement
[6]
Some time prior to April 1984, a Mr. Ozorak applied to have the family allowance benefits paid equally to him and his wife. He and his wife were not separated or divorced. His request was refused and he filed a complaint with the Commission. He argued that the refusal constituted discrimination on the basis of sex. At the time, payment of the benefit cheques to the male parent was only possible when the male parent had custody of the child or if the female parent was incapacitated or if other special circumstances rendered such necessary [see footnote 3].
[7]
Mr. Ozorak's complaint was settled and pursuant to that settlement the Department adopted Operational Policy No. 115-86. The settlement also involved a commitment by the Department to have the
Family Allowances Regulations
amended to coincide with the new policy.
[8]
The Operational Bulletin, which was issued November 24, 1986, to implement the new policy, stated that while in the past family allowance cheques had been paid to a male parent only when he had custody of the child or when the female parent was incapacitated, from now on payment would also be made when there was a martial breakdown and joint custody had been awarded or when it was the male parent who remained at home to care for the child. The Bulletin stated that in these two additional cases, it would be necessary for both parents to agree in writing that the payments should be made to the male parent [see footnote 4].
[9]
The Commission was involved in the negotiation of that policy and approved it. As I understand it, part of the rationale for the settlement was that statistical evidence showed that it was most often the female parent who was primarily responsible for the day to day care of a child and the female parent's income, in most cases, was lower than that of the male parent. Also, requiring agreement in cases of joint custody would encourage parties to consider the question of the disposition of the family allowance cheques in the agreements or arrangements respecting child support which are coincident on a marriage breakdown.
[10]
In April of 1987, the Commission issued a communiqué to the public announcing the change. That communiqué reads in part:
"Family Allowance Can Go To Fathers Who Have Joint Custody
"OTTAWA, April 24, 1987 -- Champions of father's rights have won a small victory as a result of a sex discrimination complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission.
"In a conciliated settlement approved by the Commission at its April meeting, the Department of National Health and Welfare has agreed to allow payment of family allowances to men who have joint custody of children or who stay at home to care for them.
. . . . .
"However, the terms of the settlement state that men can now collect family allowances in the event of marital breakdown -- where parents have joint custody of children -- or where men remain at home to care for children. Both parents must approve the payment of allowances to the male parent, and if there is any disagreement, the department will continue to pay the female parent.
"Health and Welfare has issued an operational bulletin to instruct its staff members on how to implement the new policy until specific changes to the
Regulations
are made. ..."
[11]
The
Family Allowances Regulations
were subsequently amended. The underlined provisions were added on December 21, 1989 by SOR/90-35.
"9(1) Where payment of a family allowance is approved, the allowance shall be paid to the male parent where:
(a) there is no female parent; or
(b) the female parent and the male parent are living separate and apart and the male parent has, in fact, custody of the child.
"(1.1)
Where payment of family allowance is approved and both the female parent and male parent declare in writing that the male parent is the parent who is primarily responsible for the day-to-day care of the child, the family allowance may be paid to the male parent.
"(1.2)
Where payment of a family allowance is approved and the female parent and the male parent are living separate and apart and have, in fact, joint custody of the child, the family allowance may, on the written request of both the female parent and the male parent, be paid to the male parent.
. . . . .
"(3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2), payment of any allowance under this Act may be made to any parent or other suitable person or agency in any case where the Minister, on the basis of information received by him,
(a) considers it necessary to do so by reason of infirmity, ill health, improvidence or other reasonable cause of disqualification of the person to whom the allowance is otherwise payable; or
(b) considers that other special circumstances or reasonable cause of any kind renders payments to such a person or agency necessary." (underlining added)
Other Complaints - Federal Court
Of Appeal Litigation
[12]
Subsequent to the Ozorak settlement other complaints concerning the payment of the family allowance cheques to the female parent were filed: Vincer (filed June 24, 1987); Savard (June 6, 1988); Rexer (November 19, 1988); Wilson (September 6, 1989); Philibert (November 9, 1989); Reed (January 8, 1990); Kahle (March 22, 1991); Fodness (May 13, 1991).
[13]
Under the
Family Allowances Act
a parent who applied to be paid benefits and who was refused payment by the Department could appeal that decision to a Review Committee ("Committee") [see footnote 5]. In most cases the above listed complainants had, before filing a complaint with the Commission, applied to the Committee by way of an appeal from the Department's initial refusal to pay the cheques to them. In the case of Mr. Vincer, the earliest of the above-mentioned complainants, the Committee granted his appeal finding s. 7(1) of the
Family Allowances Act
and s. 9(1) of the
Family Allowances Regulations
(in its pre-1989 version) to be contrary to the
Charter
. It was held that those provisions constituted discrimination on the basis of sex. Judicial review of this decision was sought.
[14]
On December 1, 1987 the Federal Court of Appeal held that the Committee did not have jurisdiction to determine whether
Charter
rights had been infringed:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [see footnote 6]. Mr. Justice Pratte did not share the view of the majority of the court, that the Committee lacked jurisdiction, but agreed that the Committee's decision should be quashed:
"... I am of opinion that the Review Committee was wrong in deciding that subsection 7(1) of the
Family Allowances Act
, 1973 [S.C. 1973-74, c. 44] and paragraph 9(1)(b) of the
Regulations
[
Family Allowances Regulations
, C.R.C., c. 642] contravened s. 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
[being Part I of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, Schedule B,
Canada Act 1982
, 1982, c. 11 (U.K.)].
"Clearly those provisions made a distinction between women and men; clearly they treat women more favourably than men. However, in order for s. 15 to be contravened, it is necessary that this distinction be unfair and unreasonable; otherwise it does not amount to discrimination. This is not the case here since the statistics filed by the applicant show that the distinction between women and men that is made by the provisions in question is fully justified by the obvious disparity of income between husbands and wives.
"I would for this reasons allow the s. 28 application, set aside the decision under attack and refer the matter back to the Committee in order that it be decided on the basis that subsection 7(1) of the
Family Allowances Act, 1973
and paragraph 9(1)(b) of the
Family Allowances Regulations
have been validly enacted." (footnote omitted)
[15]
Mr. Rexer, the second of the above listed complainants, also became involved in litigation relating to his claim. Mr. Rexer applied to the Department, on June 23, 1987, for payment of one-half of the family allowance benefits. He was divorced from his wife and had joint custody of his two children. The Department refused his request because his ex-wife would not consent. He appealed that decision to the Committee. The Committee found in his favour, on the ground that Family Allowances Regulation 9(1)(b) allowed the payment of the cheques to be made to the father, when there was a joint custody arrangement, even though the wife did not consent, and the Department had not paid Mr. Rexer. This decision was challenged. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld that challenge:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Federal Court of Appeal held that under regulation 9(1)(b) there was no authority to pay the cheques to the male parent unless the female parent agreed. The Court of Appeal went on, however, to state: "... sub-paragraph 9(3)(b) ... supports the power of the Minister to grant the relief asked for by this respondent. ... the Minister has jurisdiction, pursuant to regulation 9(3)(b), to order that one half of the Family Allowance payments payable ... be payable to the respondent herein".
Disposition Of The Complaints
[16]
Mr. Vincer, as has been noted, filed his complaint with the Commission in June of 1987. The processing of this complaint was held in abeyance by the Commission, initially pending the outcome of the judicial review of the Committee's decision,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ("the Vincer litigation"). After the unsuccessful decision on the judicial review application, Mr. Vincer had obtained money from the Court Challenges Program to finance an action in the Federal Court Trial Division, to seek a declaration that s. 7(1) of the
Family Allowances Act
contravened s. 15 of the
Charter
. This action, however, was never commenced.
[17]
The fact that is [sic] was known that Mr. Vincer contemplated commencing litigation affected the processing of the various complaints which had been filed with the Commission; they were held in abeyance. At the same time, the initial stage of having an investigation conducted and a report prepared was in most instance completed. In some cases this was done at a fairly early stage.
[18]
The initial investigation report in the Vincer case was not filed in the present proceedings. The chronology of events found in the respondents' application record indicates that an investigation report was prepared in October 1988 and subsequently returned to the region (Newfoundland). A revised report was prepared in April of 1990 and another in December of 1991, about which more will be said later.
[19]
In the case of Savard, the investigator's report dated November 4, 1988 recommended dismissal of the complaint because the Commission had previously determined that the payments to the female and male parents in accordance with the provisions of the
Family Allowances Act
and the new
Regulations
were reasonable.
[20]
In the cases of Rexer (report dated May 3, 1990), Wilson (June 12, 1990) and Kahle (August 16, 1991), the investigator's report recommended that the complaints be dismissed. These reports referred to the position which the Commission had taken in the Ozorak settlement as well as the justification which had been given in Parliament for the provisions of the
Act
and
Regulations
. The justification which had been given was that, while paying the benefit cheque automatically to mothers might be a prima facie breach of s. 15 of the
Charter
, the sex-based distinction was justifiable since the payments were intended for the benefit of the children and not for the mothers or fathers. The parent receiving the cheque was acting as a trustee of the benefit to be used for the child.
[21]
In the case of Philibert, a "report prior to investigation" was prepared on December 14, 1989. It recommended that the complaint be held in abeyance pending the Vincer litigation. In the case of Reed, a report was prepared, dated December 14, 1989, it referred to the Ozorak settlement and the justification for the provision which had been given in Parliament and recommended that the complaint be kept in abeyance pending the Vincer litigation.
[22]
Nothing further was done until the fall of 1991 at which time letters were sent to the Department concerning Wilson and Savard, dated November 22 and November 27, 1991, respectively. These indicated that those two complaints were being forwarded by the Commission staff to the Commission for final disposition with the recommendation that they be dismissed. Then, by letter dated November 28, 1991, the Department was advised that the complaints of Wilson, Savard, Rexer, Philibert, Reed and Kahle were being forwarded to the Commission with the recommendation that they be referred to the Tribunal for a full enquiry. The Department was invited to file any submissions it might wish to make in response to those recommendations. The Department was instructed that any such submissions had to arrive by December 11, 1991. The Department eventually obtained an extension of this time limit to January 16, 1994.
[23]
On January 6, 1994, the Commission sent the Department an Investigation Report containing the recommendation that the Vincer complaint be forwarded to the Tribunal for a full enquiry. The investigator's report which was sent, as has been noted, was a revised one. It indicated that the Federal Court of Appeal had stated in the Rexer case (decided May 11, 1990) that the Minister had authority under Family Allowances Regulation 9(3)(b) to issue family allowance cheques to the father in joint custody cases. It noted that no such ministerial decision had yet been made in the Rexer case. Thus a referral of the Vincer complaint to the Tribunal was recommended.
[24]
The Department subsequently sought a further extension of time for the filing of submissions in the Wilson, Savard, Rexer, Philibert, Reed and Khale cases and asked for some explanation from Commission staff as to why they were making the recommendations in question, particularly given the settlement in the Ozorak case. The request for an extension of time was refused. The answer, to the second enquiry, received by letter dated January 14, 1993, was:
"You also have inquired as to the reasons why the Director of Compliance is recommending tribunal in light of the
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  two of the cases cited above, Savard (Q11592) and Wilson (T41366) in that all three reside with their spouses. Mr. Child is recommending that these cases be dismissed. In the other cases, the complainants are not residing with their spouses. I believe that Mr. Child's memorandum and the accompanying documentation will provide you with the information you require to respond."
[25]
This was not an accurate representation of the Ozorak settlement. Although Mr. Ozorak's personal situation was one in which he was not separated from his wife, the settlement which was reached dealt with joint custody situations and was advertised by the Commission to the public as doing so. Also, the statement that Mr. Child was recommending that the Savard and Wilson cases be dismissed was in direct contradiction to the letter, sent by the Commission on November 28, 1991, stating that the recommendation being made was that they be referred for an inquiry by the Tribunal.
[26]
Mr. Child was however recommending that the Wilson and Savard cases be dismissed. This was because the Department, in cases where there was no marital breakdown, had a policy of offering to deposit the family allowance cheques into a joint account to which both parents had access rather than paying it to the female parent. This accommodation had been offered to Mr. Wilson, for example, and he had refused it. Messrs. Wilson and Savard were not separated or divorced from their wives.
[27]
The other complaints all went forward however with the recommendation that they be referred to the Tribunal for a full enquiry. In the case of Mr. Kahle, the memorandum pointed out that the father had joint custody of the children but that both children actually resided with the mother. It noted that Mr. Kahle had applied to the Department to have the cheques paid, in part, to him but had been refused because his wife would not consent. Accordingly, referral of the complaint to the Tribunal was being recommended. I note particularly that the Commission staff was not recommending dismissal of this complaint.
[28]
The memorandum in the Philibert case was not very illuminating. It merely pointed out that: the complaint had been stood down awaiting the outcome of the Vincer litigation; it was now clear that the litigation was not going to go ahead; Mr. Philibert and his wife spent about equal time caring for their children; and therefore the author was of the view that the complainant had a right to an equal portion of the family allowance benefits ("je crois qu'il a droit à une portion égale des allocations familiales").
[29]
The recommendation which was sent to the Commission in the Reed case is particularly bizarre. When Mr. Reed first filed his complaint in 1990 he stated that "
I am the sole support father
of two children. By court order,
the children reside with me
." The initial investigation by the Commission dated September 27, 1990 states "The complainant states that following his divorce sometime in 1988,
he was awarded joint custody of the two children
of the marriage ... The complainant's former wife confirms ... both her ex-husband and herself have joint custody of their two children, and that she does provide for them when they are with her. A Supreme Court of Ontario decision dated August 10, 1988, directed that custody of the children ... be shared jointly ..."
[30]
Curiously the memorandum which was sent by Mr. Child to the Commission recommending that the Reed complaint be referred to the Tribunal states:
"Mr. Reed, who is divorced,
and has two children who reside with him
, is seeking to have the Family Allowance benefits issued to him. His former wife,
whom the children visit
, refuses to give her consent.
. . . . .
"Since Mr. Reed
is the primary case-giver
, and the children reside with him, I believe he is entitled to receive the Family Allowance benefits." (underlining added)
[31]
As is clear from the
Family Allowances Regulations
set out above, if Mr. Reed had sole custody of the children he would be entitled to the family allowance cheques pursuant to regulation 9(1). No issue within the jurisdiction of the Commission would exist. The question would be whether or not the Department had wrongly refused payment to Mr. Reed and whether mandamus would lie to compel the payment of the cheques to him.
[32]
In the case of Mr. Vincer, as has been noted, the recommendation was based on a revised investigation report which had only recently been prepared. Both that report and the staff recommendation respecting the complaint hinged on the fact that the Federal Court of Appeal in the Rexer litigation had indicated that the Minister had authority under regulation 9(3)(b) to grant payment of the cheques to the male parent in joint custody situations but had not done so. The report and recommendation did not note that while Mr. Rexer had applied to the Minister under regulation 9(3)(b), Mr. Vincer had never made any such application.
[33]
The Department filed extensive submissions with the Tribunal in relation to each case. These submissions were essentially all the same. They referred to the settlement which had been reached in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, the reasons for finding that if there was a prima facie breach of s. 15 the differential treatment was in fact justified, the justification which had been given in Parliament for retaining the scheme and the comments made by Mr. Justice Pratte in the Vincer case. Part of the submissions in each case read:
"The Department has a legitimate expectation that the Commission will not deviate from a policy position adopted and approved by the Commission as part of a settlement, and is entitled to rely on such a policy.
"If the Commission had changed its position from that taken in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it is submitted that the requirements of procedural fairness impose a duty on the Commission to provide reasons for the change so that the Department can fully respond and make all relevant representations in relation to the complaint."
[34]
The Commission disposed of the complaints by dismissing those of Savard and Wilson on January 29, 1992, by dismissing those of Rexer and Kahle on February 26, 1992, but referring those of Philibert and Reed to the Tribunal on June 22 and that of Vincer on July 24, 1992.
[35]
In the case of Fodness, the complaint which was filed on May 13, 1991, the investigator's report was not ready until July 29, 1992. It recommended that the complaint be dismissed because the complainant had admitted that he was not primarily responsible for the children. A recommendation was made to the Commission to that effect on September 14, 1992. Counsel for the applicant advises that the complaint has now been referred by the Commission to conciliation.
Consistency Of Dispositions?
[36]
The Attorney General argues that these decisions are inconsistent and arbitrary. He asks on what grounds were they made and, indeed, why did the Commission resile from the negotiated settlement which had been reached  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[37]
Counsel for the Commission before me, rationalized the decisions by noting that the Savard and Wilson complaints dealt with spouses who were not separated and that in the cases of Rexer and Kahle there was evidence that in fact the children in question resided virtually full-time with their female parent despite the fact that joint custody had been ordered. In addition, in the case of Rexer, the complainant's wife stated that at the time their separation agreement had been entered into there had been a verbal agreement that she would receive the family allowance cheques and her husband would pay lower support payments as a result. These distinctions were not articulated in the memorandum sent to the Department concerning the recommendations being made, nor do they appear as the basis for differing recommendations in the investigation reports. Counsel for the applicant's observation that "no wonder the department was confused" has merit.
[38]
In the case of the two decisions which are the basis of the present applications, it is useful to summarize again what was before the Commission. In the Reed case, an investigator's report was sent to the Commission which reported that the complaint did not have sole custody of his children. It referred to the Commission's position in the Ozorak settlement, and recommended that the complaint be stood down because Mr. Vincer was commencing litigation to challenge the constitutionality of s. 7 of the
Family Allowances Act
. There was a letter from Mr. Reed asserting that he had sole custody of the children and was being refused payment of the cheques by the Department. The recommendation from the compliance section of the Commission, that the complaint be referred to the Tribunal, was based on the assertion that Mr. Reed had sole responsibility for the children. As noted above, if this was so then the issue was not one for the Commission or the Tribunal but was a matter that should have been resolved by a different process since the Department was by law required to pay the cheques to him in that situation.
[39]
In the case of Mr. Vincer, the investigator's report and the memorandum of the compliance section of the Commission founded their recommendations on the fact that the Rexer case had held that the Minister had authority, under regulation 9(3)(b), to pay the cheques, in joint custody cases, to the male parent but that the Minister had not yet done so with respect to Mr. Rexer. Therefore it was recommended that Mr. Vincer's complaint should be referred to the Tribunal. Mr. Vincer had never made a request to the Minister that he exercise his discretion under regulation 9(3)(b) and when the Commission considered the Rexer complaint it was dismissed even though the Minister had not made a decision in Mr. Rexer's favour.
[40]
Counsel for the applicant argues that the Department did not know whether the Commission was alleging that discrimination had occurred because the Minister had not granted payment of the cheques to the male parents under regulation 9(3)(b), as the Court of Appeal in the Rexer case seemed to say he could, or whether the Commission was challenging the validity of s. 7(1) of the
Family Allowances Act
, which had been the focus of the anticipated Vincer litigation, or whether the Commission was challenging the validity of the amendments to regulation 9 which the Commission had approved as part of the Ozorak settlement.
Legitimate Expectations
[41]
There is no dispute about the relevant law. It was held in
Reference Re: Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.)
, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 525; 127 N.R. 161; 1 B.C.A.C. 241; 1 W.A.C. 241 esp. at 557, that the doctrine of legitimate expectations does not create substantive rights. The doctrine is part of the rules of procedural fairness which govern administrative bodies. It can create rights such as that to be consulted or to make representations. In
The Board of Education of the Indian Head School Division No. 19 of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Sask.R. 81; 69 D.L.R.(4th) 489; [1990] 3 W.W.R. 289, it was held that the existence of a general duty of fairness depends on: (i) the nature of the decision to be made by the administrative body; (ii) the relationship existing between that body and the party in question; (iii) the effect of the decision on the individuals rights. In
Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 241; 62 D.L.R.(4th) 385, the nature of decisions made by the Commission under what are now s. 44(3) and s. 49 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
is discussed. The Commission's decisions in that context were held to be administrative, rather than quasi-judicial. Thus, the rules of fairness, not natural justice, applied. The decisions were described as being ones in which the Commission had to decide whether a complaint should be moved from the investigatory stage to the judicial or quasi-judicial stage. The Commission's role was to decide whether there was a reasonable basis for proceeding to the next stage. In that context, those affected by the decision had to be informed of the substance of the evidence and the recommendations which were being put before the Commission and to be given an opportunity to respond:
"it is incumbent on the Commission to give the parties the opportunity to respond to this evidence and make all relevant representations in relation thereto ..." [see footnote 7]
[42]
In the present case, all the material which was provided to the Commission for the purpose of making a decision was also provided to the applicant and an opportunity to comment thereon was given. The respondent argues that the obligation which was on the Commission has accordingly been met. I am not persuaded that this is so. I think the Department was entitled to a fuller explanation of the position which was being taken and to some consultation with respect thereto before a decision to refer the complaints to the Tribunal was taken.
[43]
The discrimination which was alleged related to the operation of a government program of general application and involved the distribution of significant sums of money. Changes to the way that program operated, including amendments to the relevant
Regulations
, had been made by the Department at the Commission's request. The Department then operated the program in reliance on that agreement. What is more when making submissions to the Commission, concerning the recommendations in the Vincer, Savard, Rexer, Wilson, Philibert, Reed and Khale cases, the applicant relied upon the agreement which had previously been reached and asked the Commission to communicate further with the Department if the Commission was resiling from that agreement.
[44]
In my view, the Commission had an obligation, as a matter of fairness, to do so. I do not mean to suggest that the Commission could not change its mind and could not resile from the earlier agreement but I am of the view that the Commission should have made it clear to the applicant exactly in what respect it was resiling from its earlier position, if it was, and why. The explanation might be no more than to say that the Commission thought it had made a mistake at the earlier time or had not adequately considered whatever factors it was which caused the change in position. But the Department is surely entitled to know. Otherwise, in the context of this case, its ability to respond in a meaningful way is restricted.
[45]
As counsel for the Attorney General points out, the Commission is exercising a public policy function as well as deciding upon individual complaints. In that context, its normal procedure is to discuss fundamental changes in policy with a Department before pronouncing upon them. If it is proposing a fundamental change in policy which has been agreed upon earlier, then, there is an obligation to at least apprise the Department of this fact and its reasons so that the Department can respond, before invoking a full scale Tribunal enquiry with all the attendant costs and effort that that entails. If, on the other hand, the Commission is asserting that the Minister's refusals under regulation 9(3)(b) constituted a discriminatory practice, then, the Department is entitled to know that. Otherwise it is not in a position to adequately respond to the staff's recommendations.
[46]
Having come to the conclusion that the Commission's decisions should be quashed, I do not need to deal with the other arguments made by the Attorney General, except to say, that I am not persuaded that it is open to me to issue a writ of mandamus requiring the Commission to dismiss the complaints or to issue writs of prohibition permanently enjoining the Commission from referring them to the Tribunal.
Standing Of The Commission

When, the present litigation was commenced the Commission was named as a respondent. Since that time the Court of Appeal decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Consequently, at the recommencement of the hearing on February 23, 1994, counsel asked that I grant an order making the Commission an intervenor in these proceedings. This was done.
[48]
I should note as well that the Attorney General argues that whether the Commission is a party or an intervenor the Commission does not have authority to make representations on the merits of the case and particularly whether the rules of fairness have been complied with. Counsel argues that the parameters of a Tribunal's entitlement to make representations on a judicial review application was set out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 449; 7 Alta. L.R.(2d) 370; 89 D.L.R.(3d) 161, at pp. 709-711. In that case it was held that a tribunal had the right to make representations respecting the tribunal's jurisdiction and to play an explanatory role with respect to the tribunal's record. Mr. Justice Estey added:
"In the sense the term has been employed by me here, 'jurisdiction' does not include the transgression of the authority of a tribunal by its failure to adhere to the rules of natural justice. In such an issue, when it is joined by a party to proceedings before that tribunal in a review process, it is the tribunal which finds itself under examination. To allow an administrative board the opportunity to justify its action and indeed to vindicate itself would produce a spectacle not ordinarily contemplated in our judicial traditions. ..."
[49]
While that statement is framed in a very categorical way, I cannot believe that it was meant to be applied automatically in all cases of judicial review without some assessment of the nature of the tribunal in question and the grounds on which the decision is being challenged, such assessment to be undertaken in the context of the purpose behind the rule that accords tribunals only a limited role on judicial review applications.
[50]
The Commission plays a particular role on behalf of complainants. It investigates the complaints and, then, if it decides they are warranted steps into the complainants' shoes, first to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the complaint and, then, if that is not successful, to proceed before the Tribunal.
[51]
In the present case the two individual defendants will not obtain any significant economic benefit from the outcome of their complaints. One lives in Newfoundland; the other lives in Toronto. It is unthinkable that either would hire legal counsel to represent them for the purposes of the present judicial review application. Indeed, while Mr. Reed, as a result of the Federal Court of Appeal decision in
Bernard
, travelled from Toronto to be present in the court room in Ottawa, on February 23, 1994, Mr. Vincer simply could not afford either the time or the money to make the trip from Newfoundland. Most importantly, however, neither of the individual respondents have any knowledge of the facts underlying the applicant's challenge to the Commission's decision. It is the procedure which the Commission followed which is under review. This is a matter almost totally within the knowledge of the Commission and not that of the individual respondents. If the Commission cannot defend the application, there will be no response made to the applicant's position. I cannot believe that the Supreme Court intended such a result.
[52]
As I understand the law, the Tribunal's role in a judicial review application is restricted because the usual remedy, when the applicant is successful, is to send the matter back for a rehearing by that same Tribunal (preferably by a differently constituted panel thereof when that is possible). Thus, the limited standing on review is designed to preserve, to the extent possible, the Tribunal's image of impartiality. One can particularly see how this is the case when the Tribunal's decision is being challenged because it was not reasonably based on the evidence before it or because the Tribunal misapplied or misinterpreted the law. It is difficult, however, to see how its image of impartiality is tainted by making representation with respect to the procedure which was followed. In the case of questions of procedure, such a using legal advisors to review decisions, the discussion of general questions of policy development by all members of the tribunal, whether an adequate number of days of notice has been provided, the merits of the particular tribunal decision are not engaged. I have some difficulty understanding how representations by a tribunal on these kinds of questions might be seen to undercut its image of impartiality.
[53]
In any event, in the present case, the Commission, as a matter of necessity, must be given the right to respond to the applicant's application and in a manner comparable to that of a party. This is so at least with respect to that part of the applicant's case which is based on the reasonable expectations doctrine. Since I have not found it necessary to consider the arguments that the decisions were on their merits unreasonable, I do not need to address the proper scope of the Commission's role with respect to that issue.
Conclusion
[54]
For the reasons given the Commission's decisions which are the subject of these applications will be quashed. The Commission, as intervenor, has been given the right to participate fully in the application, including the right of appeal.
Application allowed.
