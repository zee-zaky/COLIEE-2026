Muldoon, J.
: This case, as John A. Hargrave, Esq., prothonotary, wrote on October 27, 1995, has provided "interesting argument and material".
[2]
The plaintiff sues for a declaration of the invalidity of certain immigration regulations in a relatively brief statement of claim, which runs as follows:
"1. The plaintiff was sponsored to come to Canada from Guyana as a member of the family class on October 20th, 1988.
"2. The plaintiff received an immigrant visa on July 24, 1990 at Georgetown, Guyana.
"3. The plaintiff became a landed immigrant from Guyana on September 14, 1990.
"4. An immigration officer reported the plaintiff for inquiry on July 8, 1993 on the ground that he was granted landing by reason of misrepresentation of a material fact, by virtue of non-disclosure of the birth of a son on April 13, 1990.
"5. The Director of Immigration, Manitoba Region, issued a direction on July 19, 1993 that an inquiry be held to determine whether the allegation in the report was correct.
"6. An adjudicator found the plaintiff was granted landing by reason of misrepresentation of a material fact by virtue of non-disclosure of the birth of a son.
"7. The plaintiff was ordered deported on September 23, 1993.
"8. The plaintiff appealed the deportation order to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Board dismissed the appeal by disposition dated July 29th, 1994 and signed September 2, 1994.
"9. The plaintiff applied for leave and judicial review to the Federal Court Trial Division. The sole basis for the leave application was that the Immigration regulation on which the deportation order was based was ultra vires the
Immigration Act
. Mr. Justice MacKay granted leave on March 16, 1995 and set the hearing of the application for judicial review for June 6, 1995.
"10. Mr. Justice Heald, a judge designate of the Federal Court Trial Division, dismissed the application for judicial review by decision dated June 27, 1995 without deciding whether the Immigration regulation on which the deportation order was based was ultra vires the
Immigration Act
or not. The judge held that the court had no jurisdiction to decide that question under section 18.1(3) of the
Federal Court Act
since the issue had not been raised at the level of the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board by the then counsel to the plaintiff.
"11. The plaintiff therefore claims a declaration from this court that the
Immigration Act
does not empower the Governor-in-Council to pass regulations barring the admission to Canada of any immigrant because of a non-accompanying dependant of the immigrant is a member of an inadmissible class."
[3]
In the government's statement of defence the Deputy Attorney General admits all of the allegations asserted in paragraphs 1 through 8 of the plaintiff's statement of claim. The defendant denies only those asserted in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 above recited.
[4]
Although the defendant has admitted most of the statement of claim, it was not without asserting additional facts. It is worthwhile, then, to recite some of the defendant's allegations:
"4. IN FURTHER RESPONSE TO the allegations contained in paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim, the defendant states that in conjunction with his sponsorship, the plaintiff, on September 19, 1988, completed a statutory declaration in which he declared that:
(a) he has never been married;
(b) he had no children; and
(c) he recognized his responsibility to advise the Canadian High Commission in writing if there was any change in his marital status or if he had any children prior to leaving for Canada.
"5. IN FURTHER RESPONSE TO the allegations contained in paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim, the defendant states that the plaintiff arrived in Toronto and upon arrival was asked if he had any dependants, to which the plaintiff answered in the negative.
"6. IN FURTHER RESPONSE TO the allegations contained in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim, the defendant states that prior to the immigration officer's report for inquiry:
(a) the plaintiff returned to Guyana in 1992 and married the mother of his son in Guyana on August 19, 1992; and
(b) in November of 1992, the plaintiff sponsored his wife and child for entrance to Canada.
"7. IN FURTHER RESPONSE TO the allegations contained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Statement of Claim, the defendant states as follows:
(a) that the plaintiff was represented at the inquiry;
(b) that the plaintiff indicated that he understood the nature of the allegations made against him and the possible consequences to him from those allegations;
(c) that the plaintiff, through his representative, conceded the facts as alleged by the Minister's representative; and
(d) that the adjudicator found that the plaintiff was granted landing by reason of a misrepresentation and that the misrepresentation was material.
"8. IN FURTHER RESPONSE TO the allegations contained in paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim, the defendant adds the following:
(a) that the plaintiff was represented before the Board;
(b) that the plaintiff's representative was asked if the legal validity of the removal order against the plaintiff was being challenged;
(c) that the plaintiff, through his representative, indicated that the legal validity of the removal order was not being challenged;
(d) that the Board, in its written reasons, noted that the legal validity of the deportation was not challenged and that the case was based entirely on the equitable jurisdiction of the Board, having regard to all the circumstances of the case;
(e) that the Board found as fact that the plaintiff deliberately hid the birth of his son from immigration officials.
"9. IN FURTHER RESPONSE TO the allegations contained in paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim, the Respondent denies that the sole basis for the leave application was the claim of ultra vires regarding Immigration Regulation 6(1). The defendant states that the Application for Leave did not contain any claim regarding the ultra vires of any legislation; rather, the claim in the Application for Leave is based on an allegation that the Board failed to consider all the circumstances of the case. The defendant recognizes that the plaintiff's Memorandum of Argument contained an argument regarding the alleged ultra vires of Regulation 6(1) and that Leave was subsequently granted by this Honourable Court.
"10. IN FURTHER RESPONSE TO the allegations contained in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim, the defendant admits that the Honourable Mr. Justice Heald dismissed the application for judicial review by decision dated June 27, 1995, but denies that His Lordship held that he had no jurisdiction to decide the issue of the vires of the impugned regulation. The defendant states that His Lordship heard extensive argument from both the plaintiff (Applicant) and Respondent on the issue of the vires of Regulation 6(1) and determined that the plaintiff's submissions were not persuasive in any way on all issues, including the issue of ultra vires. His Lordship rejected the plaintiff's arguments regarding the alleged ultra vires regulation. His Lordship also determined that the Board had not committed any reviewable error by not addressing an issue that was not raised, and was in fact conceded, before it.
"11. IN FURTHER RESPONSE TO the Statement of Claim as a whole, the defendant pleads and relies on the doctrine of res judicata and estoppel by matter of record."
[5]
In addition to the statement of defence, the Deputy Attorney General moved on the defendant's behalf for:
(1) Summary judgement [sic] in favour of the defendant; [and]
(2) In the alternative, an order that the provisions of the
Immigration Regulations
which bar the admission to Canada on any immigrant because a non-accompanying dependent of the immigrant is a member of an inadmissible class are not ultra vires the
Immigration Act
, and dismissing the plaintiff's Statement of Claim;
(3) Costs for this action; and * * *
on the grounds following:
(1) The statement of claim fails to raise a genuine issue for trial;
(2)
Federal Court Rules
432.1(2), 432.3(1) and (3).
[6]
The facts are found to be as fully set out in the statement of defence which is confirmed by the reasons expressed by Mr. Justice Heald in dismissing the plaintiff's motion for judicial review, which reasons were dated June 27, 1995 in proceedings number IMM-4347-94 [See 98 F.T.R. 58]. The plaintiff, as an applicant before the Appeal Division (App. Div'n.) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), confirmed that he had no quarrel with the validity of the deportation order which had been made against him. His appeal was founded on s. 70(3)(b) of the
Act
. It was dismissed. The App. Div'n. found explicitly that the deportation order was valid in law. The question of the vires of regulations 6(1)(a), 9(1)(a) and 10(1)(a) was, of course, not raised in his application for leave, which was, however, granted.
[7]
The question of those
Regulations'
vires was not raised until the plaintiff, still as applicant, raised it upon the judicial review proceedings. Naturally, Mr. Justice Heald upon a review of the Appeal Division's performance, would not adjudicate an issue which was never before that tribunal. He wrote:
"As noted by respondent's counsel 'The Board [App. Div'n.] cannot be faulted for failing to anticipate a myriad of potential arguments that might be raised by an applicant. Similarly, the board cannot be said to have committed a reviewable error by not addressing issues which were not raised (and were in fact conceded) before it.'"
(reasons, p. 5 - Mason's affidavit, ex. J)
All the foregoing shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that the question of the
Regulations'
vires was never raised before the Appeal Division.
[8]
There is a plethora of jurisprudence which supports the defendant's complaint herein to the effect that: if a party to litigation could have raised an issue before a competent tribunal, that party fails to raise the issue at the peril of being estopped on the basis of res judicata when purporting to raise that same issue in subsequent litigation in which the same adversary is engaged. The above mentioned party's practice was roundly condemned by the Alberta Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where the Supreme Court adopted a passage from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  litigation to bring forward their whole case and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward only because they have from negligence, inadvertence or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time."
[10]
So also, in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> judgment the Supreme Court adopted the following passage from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (P.C.):
"Parties are not permitted to begin fresh litigations because of new views they may entertain of the law of the case, or new versions which they present as to what should be a proper apprehension by the court of the legal result either of the construction of the documents or the weight of certain circumstances.
"If this were permitted litigation would have no end, except when legal ingenuity is exhausted. It is a principle of law that this cannot be permitted, and there is abundant authority reiterating that principle."
[11]
The principle which the defendant invokes, in this motion for summary judgment, is of venerable vintage and although judge-made, it is so old as to have been born in Latin: "nemo debet bis vexari ... pro una et eadem causa". No one ought to be twice vexed ... for one and the same cause. An applicant or plaintiff asserting a claim must claim all of his or her relief in regard to such cause or claim and any second attempt to elicit the court's aid in or for the same cause or claim must be prevented. So it is virtually asserted in Sopinka & Lederman,
The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases
(1974), at p. 369. This is what the Alberta Court of Appeal meant (above) in denouncing "litigation by instalment".
[12]
The above statement of the law in regard to res judicata and estoppel is confirmed in the following jurisprudence, at least,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  W.A.C. 214; 128 D.L.R.(4th) 488 (C.A.), at pp. 493-494; [also abuse of process and
fragmentation
of litigation]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).
[13]
So, if a matter could have been put in issue between the parties, it is deemed to have been so put and its resolution is merged in the decision rendered, here, that of the App. Div'n. of the IRB. The matter of the
Regulations'
validity was, of course, conceded by the plaintiff before the App. Div'n. of the IRB and so, never put in issue there, as above noted. Was there an identity of parties? The plaintiff's adversary before the adjudicator, whether represented or not, and later before the Appeal Division, was the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, who is the government's executive member responsible for the enforcement of the
Immigration Act
. While that
Act
is part of this country's legislation, it is enforced by the government, in its permanent sense, and it inevitably includes a Minister in the sense of "the government of the day" to enforce this part of the legislation. Now the plaintiff, that erstwhile applicant, nominally sues Her Majesty in the rôle of defendant. This defendant is his adversary. Her Majesty is the Head of State which means the government in its permanent sense first and foremost, as well as the government of the day, identified with Her Majesty's prime minister (and cabinet colleagues) of the day. So, it is quite clear that this law suit, comprehends the same parties as were before the Appeal Division of the IRB.
[14]
It may be wondered if the Appeal Division were a competent tribunal to pronounce on the matter of the statutory validity of the
Regulations
in question, that is according to paragraph 11 of the statement of claim, those "barring the admission to Canada of any immigrant because a non-accompanying dependant of the immigrant is a member of an inadmissible class". In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 358, the Supreme Court of Canada clearly adjudged that an administrative tribunal, a board of referees, which has not expressly been provided the power to consider all relevant law may not apply the
Charter
and has no jurisdiction to determine whether the previous s. 31 of the
Unemployment Insurance Act
, 1971, R.S.C. 1985, c. U-1, violated s. 15 of the
Charter
. By contrast, citing section 96 of that insurance statute, the court found that Parliament had conferred on every umpire (usually a judge of this court) the power to "decide any question of law or fact".
[15]
The judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), of which footnote 5 on p. 243 is the most pertinent passage here, was decided much prior to the Supreme Court's judgment  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  cited. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Marceau acknowledged "the possibility of a legislative authority attributing to a tribunal which it creates the incidental responsibility of overseeing the constitutionality of statutes it is entrusted to administer."
[16]
So, how stands it with the Appeal Division of the IRB? The powers conferred on the Appeal Division are set out in the
Immigration Act
's Part IV, section 69.4 which runs, in part, thus:
"69.4(1) The Appeal Division is a court of record and shall have an official seal which shall be judicially noticed.
"(2) The Appeal Division has, in respect of appeals made pursuant to sections 70, 71 and 77, sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact, including questions of jurisdiction, that may arise in relation to the making of a removal order or the refusal to approve an application for landing made by a member of the family class."
There is no doubt that the plaintiff's circumstances brought him properly before the App. Div'n. in terms of its above described jurisdiction. Like an umpire considered by the Supreme Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Appeal Division has been accorded by Parliament "exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact including questions of jurisdiction". Clearly the Appeal Division was and is a competent tribunal - "a court of record" - to hear and determine the question of the validity of the described
Regulations
raised by the plaintiff in this action and, therefore, that question is res judicata and the plaintiff is barred from vexing the defendant a second time with it.
[17]
Indeed, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 348; 21 C.R.R.(2d) 236; 24 Imm. L.R.(2d) 117, at p. 405 S.C.R.:
"... Parliament had created a comprehensive scheme of review of immigration matters ... ."
The observation applies not only as between the Federal Court and provincial superior courts, but as between those who, like the plaintiff, have their panoply of recourses in, say, the IRB's Appeal Division, and this court. It is an abuse of process to attempt to litigate in the Trial Division of this court that which could have been validly raised in that tribunal. It is a twice-vexing of the defendant for one and the same cause and amounts to res judicata. On this ground alone summary judgment will be pronounced dismissing the plaintiff's claim, with costs.
[18]
The plaintiff argues another point on the question of res judicata. He urges that because these proceedings are a matter of public law estoppel should not be imposed, because it is in the public interest that questions of vires should always be open for consideration by the court until finally resolved. This proposition is almost entirely true, except for one factor, at least. In matters of public law and the validity of regulations and statutes there is no shortage of contenders among the populace, because it is easy enough to acquire standing. Until consideration and resolution of questions arising from such matters be finally, precisely stated, the State may be often vexed for the cause asserted by this plaintiff.
[19]
That is not true for, once the matter has been tried in a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction (i.e. the IRB's App. Div'n. or this court), and all further recourses exhausted, the State will have been "vexed" only once, for all. However this plaintiff cannot accord himself the privilege of being the "twice vexer", since he solemnly conceded the validity of the deportation order to, and before, the Appeal Division and blew away his opportunity to raise vires again and to conduct this litigation by instalment. If the matter be so important as the plaintiff's counsel alleges it to be, someone else will come along to assert it - there is no shortage of potential complainants. But the plaintiff cannot once again arrogate the privilege to himself - he is estopped.
[20]
In the event that this matter be carried further, the court deems it to be advisable, and correct, to dispose of the outstanding issue upon which the parties' counsels in oral argument agreed to deal with on this motion for summary judgment.
[21]
The plaintiff did not designate by number those regulations which he impugned in his statement of claim: he made only generic reference.
[22]
The authority to make regulations is found in s. 114 of the
Immigration Act
. It is vast and detailed, and without identifying all its pertinent aspects, it seems that at least several paragraphs, among others, are germane to the plaintiff's condition. They are:
"114(1) The Governor-in-Council may make regulations
(a) prescribing classes of immigrants and providing for the establishment, and the application to such classes, of selection standards based on such factors as family relationships, education, language, skill, occupational or business experience and other personal attributes and attainments, together with demographic considerations and labour market conditions in Canada, for the purpose of determining whether or not and the degree to which an immigrant will be able to become successfully established in Canada;
(a.1) specifying classes of immigrants for the purposes of subsection 6(8) in respect of which the immigrant and any or all dependants shall be assessed;
. . . . .
(a.3) specifying, with respect to any prescribed class of immigrants, at what stage of assessing applications for visas all or part of the selection standards provided for under paragraph (a) shall be applied;
. . . . .
(b.1) specifying, with respect to any class of immigrants, that accompanying dependants shall not be included for the purposes of any number referred to in subsection 7(10);
(c) prescribing, for the purposes of subsection 6(2), classes of persons whose applications for landing may be sponsored by Canadian citizens and permanent residents;
(d) for the purposes of subsection 6(3),
(i) designating classes of persons and admission requirements in respect of any such class and specifying, with respect to any such class, at what stage of assessing applications for admission all or part of the admission requirements shall be applied,
. . . . .
(d.1) respecting the sponsoring of persons for the purposes of subsection 6(4);
(e) prescribing, for the purposes of subsection 6(5), classes of immigrants and landing requirements in respect of immigrants and their dependants and specifying, with respect to any such class, at what stage of assessing applications for landing all or part of the landing requirements shall be applied;
(f) respecting the method of selecting immigrants, including regulations specifying, with respect to any prescribed class of immigrants, whether immigrants of that class, or immigrants of that class and any or all of their dependants, as the case may be, shall be selected
(i) on the basis of when their applications were made and duly completed in accordance with the regulations,
(ii) on a comparative basis, in relation to applications received during any specific period, to determine who will be best able to become successfully established in Canada, or
(iii) on any other basis;
. . . . .
(j.4) designating classes of persons for the purposes of subsection 12(1) who may be examined in a manner approved by the Minister instead of appearing before an immigration officer at a port of entry;
. . . . .
(m) prescribing the factors to be considered in determining whether, for medical reasons, any person is or is likely to be a danger to public health or to public safety;
. . . . .
(o) requiring persons referred to in paragraph 110(2)(a) to provide photographs of themselves or to be fingerprinted or photographed or both;
. . . . .
(x) establishing the procedures to be followed at examinations;
. . . . .
(ii.2) prescribing the classes of immigrants in respect of which landing shall be granted subject to terms and conditions, and prescribing those terms and conditions;
(ii.3) prescribing the terms and conditions that may be imposed by an immigration officer including, where such terms and conditions are for the purpose of providing adequate health or social services or for fostering a strong and viable economy and regional prosperity in Canada, terms and conditions concerning place of residence and occupation;
. . . . .
(ii.5) specifying what constitutes a duly completed application for the purposes of this act and the regulations;"
[23]
There are not only the above cited powers of regulation, but also the
Act
's other provisions to which they refer pointedly, which render anemic the plaintiff's claims that "regulations barring the admission to Canada of any immigrant because a non-accompanying [and undisclosed] dependant of the immigrant is a member of an inadmissible class" are ultra vires.
[24]
Among the various objectives of the
Act
and its immigration policy, including s. 3 thereof, the plaintiff bases his case largely on one of the ingredients of s. 3, namely paragraph (c): "to facilitate the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent residents with their close relatives from abroad". The plaintiff in effect asks the court to interpret s. 3(c) as if it subsumed all or most of the
Act
's other provisions, by reading "... permanent residents with their close relatives of no matter what class, admissible or inadmissible, from abroad." That lack of concern about admissible classes or not, could possibly be the apt articulation of the total absence of any mention of admissibility in s. 3(c), but it is not. By countering such longstanding, trite principles of law, the plaintiff virtually asserts that the policy expressed in s. 3(c) overrides all other coordinate policies expressed by this legislation.
[25]
It would be good to look at the purpose and policy of the
Immigration Act
itself. What if the statute had never been enacted or in any event did not exist? Then, immigration, if any, would occur according to the will, that is, the whim, of the executive branch of government, probably to the courts' exclusion. In the preface to
The 1996 Annotated Immigration Act of Canada
, Carswell, 1995, Toronto, the authors summarize briefly the alien's common law position, at p. vii, thus:
"In this regard, Lord Denning M.R.'s concise summary of the common law in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  law no alien has any right to enter this country except by leave of the Crown; and the Crown can refuse leave without giving any reason: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  such conditions as it thinks fit, as to his length of stay, or otherwise. He has no right whatever to remain here. He is liable to be sent home to his own country at any time if, in the opinion of the Crown, his presence here is not conducive to the public good; and for this purpose, the executive may arrest him and put him on board a ship or aircraft bound for his own country: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 300, 301. The position of aliens at common law has since been covered by the various regulations; but the principles remain the same.'"
[26]
The authors of that opus then refer the reader "to the annotations under s. 3 of the
Act
." Under s. 3, at p. 58, there is this annotation about the purpose of the
Act
, thus:
"
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).
This decision provides a useful statement of first principles which are to govern the court's approach to interpreting the
Immigration Act
.
The court stated that the purpose of the
Immigration Act
was to regulate immigration into Canada, which means that some immigration is permitted and some is rejected according to the law.
To determine the purpose of a statute the court recommended the procedure in
Heydon's Case
(1584), 3 Co. Rep. 7a; 76 E.R. 637, to the effect that the true determination of a statute is to proceed according to the following principles:
1. the determination of what the common law was before the making of the
Immigration Act
;
2. the determination of the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide;
3. the examination of the remedy that Parliament has resolved and appointed to cure the problem; and
4. it is the responsibility of judges to make such construction of the statute as required to suppress the mischief which Parliament addressed and advance the remedy which Parliament provided. The court is to suppress subtle inventions and evasions designed to continue the mischief.
The court noted that at Confederation section 95 of the
Constitution Act, 1867
provided that each province can make laws in relation to immigration into the province and that the Parliament of Canada may from time to time make laws in relation to immigration into all or any of the provinces and that any provincial law in relation to immigration has effect only so long as it is not repugnant to a law of the Parliament of Canada in relation to immigration. Further, the court noted that section 95(25) [sic 91(25)] distributed legislative power in relation to naturalization and aliens to Parliament.
The court then went on to deal with the merits of this case and dismissed the application for judicial review."
[27]
In terms of regulation of immigration, it is wholly appropriate that the Canadian government know who are coming into Canada seeking permanent residence and what their circumstances are. The circumstance of having a dependent person is readily apparent when the dependant accompanies the immigrant. If the dependant be not accompanying him or her, the immigration authorities are still absolutely entitled to know of the existence and identity (name, age, gender, at least) of the dependant. The would-be immigrant is obliged to reveal truthfully such information and has no excuse for concealing it, whether or not the dependant be a member of an inadmissible class. That there is ample authority in the
Immigration Act
for the Governor-in-Council (or, in apt circumstances, the Minister of the day) to make such Regulations is wholly factual, and moreover, reasonable and logical. It is the will of Parliament. After all, who does this plaintiff think he is, in effect, to bull his way into Canada and to keep secret the existence and identity of his dependant? He could be in the clear if the pertinent regulations
were
ultra vires, but they are not.
[28]
Because the impugned
Regulations
are enacted for the clear purpose of administration of the
Act
's purposes and because they are authorized by the
Act
, at various junctures and in s. 114, they meet the test for having been enacted intra vires. The case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 126 (F.C.A.), although it differs on the matter of the App. Div'n.'s equitable jurisdiction (not in issue here) presents two striking parallels upon which the Federal Court of Appeal found the tribunal was correct. Those correct findings demonstrate the materiality of the
Regulations
in the administration of the
Act
, and, in effect, their authority and vires.
[29]
Here are the pertinent passages, authored by Heald, J.A., reported on pp. 128-130:
"... I agree with that interpretation and would apply it to the word 'children' as employed in the 'Application for Permanent Residence' in this case. I agree with the board that the use of the word 'children' in this application for permanent residence is clear and unambiguous and is wide enough to encompass the appellant's children in Uganda. Accordingly, in failing to disclose their existence on the application, the appellant has made a misrepresentation of fact.
"Turning now to the second ground of alleged error, I conclude that the board properly applied the relevant jurisprudence to the circumstances at bar, and did not err in concluding that (Vol. 2, A.B. 313 [p. 146, Imm. L.R.(2d)]:
'[T]he appellant's failure to disclose the existence of the children prevented the immigration officer from making inquiries regarding the circumstances of the children in determining whether or not to approve the appellant's application for permanent residence.'
"The leading authority on the proper test for materiality in these circumstances was articulated by Laskin, J. (as he then was), in the
Brooks
case [1974] S.C.R. 850; 36 D.L.R.(3d) 522, at p. 873 S.C.R.:
'Lest there be any doubt on the matter as a result of the Board's reasons, I would repudiate any contention or conclusion that materiality under s. 19(1)(e)(viii) requires that the untruth or the misleading information in an answer or answers be such as to have concealed an independent ground of deportation. The untruth or misleading information may fall short of this and yet have been an inducing factor in admission. Evidence, as was given in the present case, that certain incorrect answers would have had no influence in the admission of a person is, of course, relevant to materiality. But also relevant is whether the untruths or the misleading answers had the effect of foreclosing or averting further inquiries,
even if those inquiries might not have turned up any independent ground of deportation
' (Emphasis added.)
"In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this court applied the
Brooks
test, supra, to para. 27(1)(e) of the
Act
, which is also the relevant paragraph in the case at bar. In summary, it is my conclusion that the board did not err in deciding that the misrepresentation here was material since its effect was to foreclose inquiries concerning the status and circumstances of the appellant's children in Uganda, which circumstances could, conceivably, be very relevant to the determination of the appellant's application for permanent residence."
[30]
Let no one think that this court is confusing the issues of functionality of the
Regulations
with their vires. The above passages of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision are invoked to illustrate, in virtually the same circumstances, that the
Regulations
play a functional rôle under the
Act
. They are "on the mark". In some instances where regulations are clearly seen to be "off the mark" or irrelevant it is more compelling to assert that they are, or must be, also ultra vires.
[31]
The defendant's deponent Stephen Joy for purposes of the earlier judicial review filed an affidavit which was exhibit E to the affidavit of Mark Mason filed in the present proceedings. Mr. Joy suggested that the impugned
Regulations
are in accord with one of the objectives of the
Act
set out in s. 3(c) to facilitate family reunion in Canada, assuming of course that the principal immigrant does not seem to believe that lying is the usual and acceptable manner of responding to the laws of Canada. The plaintiff may not like to hear this, but it is true. If one treats the application seriously, it will not generate family fracture in Canada, or abroad. It is clear that the plaintiff's counsel who cross-examined Mr. Joy was not impressed by Mr. Joy's evidence of the policy rationale for s. 6(1)(a) of the
Regulations
as it relates to an application made by a member of the family class. It is not clear why Mr. Joy is deposing to a superior Court (the constitutionally authentic interpreter of the law) what the law's policy is, when the court can determine that for itself. However it matters not how impressive the policy appears to counsel or to the court, insofar as the regulation's validity is concerned.
[32]
The Court of Appeal speaking through Mr. Justice Strayer in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), set out the proper criteria for determining the validity of an immigration regulation.
Jafari's
headnote summary, at p. 330, reveals this:
"Jafari's application for Convention refugee status was included in the Refugee backlog under the Refugee Claimants Designated Class Regulations (passed pursuant to the
Immigration Act
). However, he was removed from the backlog because he left Canada for more than seven days, contrary to s. 3(2)(f) of the
Regulations
. Jafari applied for an order declaring s. 3(2)(f) ultra vires under the
Immigration Act
or under ss. 7 and 15 of the
Charter
and for mandamus directing the Minister to process and finalize his application for landing in Canada as a member of the Refugee backlog.
"The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, in a decision reported 82 F.T.R. 164, held that s. 3(2)(f) was ultra vires and ordered the Minister to process and consider Jafari's application for permanent residence without reference to it. The Minister appealed."
Here is, in part, how Strayer, J.A., put the analysis:
"[14] It goes without saying that it is not for a court to determine the wisdom of delegated legislation or to assess its validity on the basis of the court's policy preferences. [See endnote 1]. The essential question for the court always is: does the statutory grant of authority permit this particular delegated legislation? In looking at the statutory source of authority one must seek all possible indicia as to the purpose and scope of permitted delegated legislation. Any limitations, express or implied, on the exercise of that power must be taken into account. One must then look to the regulation itself to see whether it conforms and where it is argued that the regulation was not made for the purposes authorized by the statute one must try to identify one or more of those purposes for which the regulation was adopted. It is accepted that a broad discretionary power [see endnote 2], including a regulation-making power may not be used for a completely irrelevant purpose but it is up to the party attacking the regulation to demonstrate what that illicit purpose might be.
"[15] We must therefore look to the statutory basis for the regulation in question. It seems to be common ground that the relevant powers are in ss. 114(d) and (e) which are to be exercised for the purposes of s. 6(2), quoted above. The respondent relies on the limitations found in s. 6(2) as conditioning regulations such as those in question here. As I read s. 6(2) it authorizes the Governor-in-Council to designate classes of persons (other than those already found to be Convention refugees) for purposes of admission.
. . . . .
"This does not mean, contrary to the arguments of respondent's counsel, that every regulation must facilitate the admission of more refugee claimants. In my view the subsection, combined with s. 114(1)(e), authorizes regulations which classify such persons in some way, and which may exempt some of those classes from some of the requirements of some of the
Regulations
. I see nothing mandatory in s. 6(2) or ss. 114(1)(d) and (e).
"[16] It is the core of the respondent's position, apparently adopted by the trial judge, that s. 3(2)(f) of the
Regulations
advances no purpose recognized in s. 6(2) and indeed is contrary to Canada's 'humanitarian tradition'.
"[17] ... I take s. 6(2), and ss. 114(d) and (e), to authorize systems of classification of, inter alia refugee claimants, and the provision of preferential treatment for some or all of those so classified. On their face the statutory provisions would appear to authorize the Governor-in-Council to make no classifications of refugee claimants, or to classify them in any way thought suitable.
. . . . .
"There is nothing to compel the making of a regulation to grant any particular exemption to any particular person or class of persons. The
Regulations
must of course be seen as in some way related to the purpose of the
Act
but this does not mean that a court can review them to see if they are necessary, wise, or effective in practice [See endnote 3]. In the present case there was evidence on behalf of the appellant as to the purpose of the
Regulations
in question. While I agree with the trial judge that some of the reasons advanced were not compelling and may in some measure have been misconceived, I do not think we can say they were completely unrelated to the purposes of the statute.
. . . . .
"[18] ... The persons assigned to the backlog program received a special advantage, at the discretion of the Governor-in-Council, and it was an advantage which was granted subject to certain conditions, one of them being that the claimant not leave Canada for more than 5 even days until his refugee claim was determined. As long as this distinction can be seen to have some connection with the proper administration of the
Act
there is no basis for holding it invalid just because not everyone who arrived before January 1, 1989 was given the same gratuitous advantage over those who arrived after that date.
"[19] It would be otherwise if it could be shown that whatever modest rationale there might be for the regulation, its main purpose was to achieve some improper and unauthorized purpose. The respondent has suggested no such improper purpose being served by the regulation in question.
"[20] Assuming then that s. 3(2)(f) of the
Regulations
is prima facie authorized by the statute, one must consider whether it is contrary to some condition imposed on the exercise of the regulation-making power.
. . . . .
"The tradition is to offer a fair process to all who come to Canada claiming refugee status, such process being for the purpose of determining whether the claimants are truly Convention refugees as interpreted by Canadian law. That is precisely what the respondent is entitled to, if he and the Board will only proceed to have his case heard by the regular refugee determination process. The fact that he might, but for his absence in the United States, have been able to take advantage of the lower threshold credible basis review allowed to backlog claimants to enable them to obtain landing does not in my view turn the fair hearing, which he is entitled to from the Board under the regular determination process, into an inhumane procedure without regard to the displaced and the persecuted.
"[21] I am therefore unable to say that s. 3(2)(f) of the
Regulations
is ultra vires the Governor-in-Council." (N.R. pp. 335-337)
[33]
The same reasoning must be applied here. In the present instance s. 6(1)(a) of the
Regulations
is, in these circumstances, an impugned regulation, for example, and ss. 114(1) (a.1), (a.3), (b.1) and (c), at least, as well as ss. 6(2), (3) and (4)(b), at least, support and authorize the making of that impugned regulation. An immigrant applicant for permanent residence is legitimately required to disclose the existence and identity of all dependants accompanying or non-accompanying. The impugned regulation is well within the scope of the Governor's rule-making authority about whose wisdom and policy this court cannot be concerned. However, the court would be concerned if the Governor-in-Council purported, by regulation, to amend the
Act
itself as was purported for example, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). These Immigration
Regulations
, by contrast, are made wholly within the ambit of the Governor's rule-making authority and make no attempt to usurp the legislative authority of Parliament, while evincing functional, material, policy directions (wise or unwise, the court does not care) in the administration of this statute-law.
[34]
The contentious issue therefore is determined thus: the
Immigration Act
does indeed empower the Governor-in-Council to pass Regulations barring the admission to Canada of any immigrant because a non-accompanying dependant of the immigrant is a member of an inadmissible class. For this reason, too, the statement of claim, and with it, the plaintiff's action is dismissed.
[35]
Overall, and on the basis of both matters in issue herein, estoppel for res judicata, and negative determination against the plaintiff of his principal if not sole matter in issue, the vires with which the impugned regulations were enacted ("passed"), the action is dismissed, with party-and-party costs payable by the plaintiff to the defendant forthwith after taxation, or upon agreement as to quantum if the plaintiff forego taxation of the defendant's costs against him.
Action dismissed.
