MacKay, J.
: This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. J.P. D'Aoust, made on behalf of the Registrar of Trademarks, dated January 5, 1984, whereby it was decided to expunge from the Register three trademarks of the appellant, the Molson Companies Limited, for use in association with brewed alcoholic beverages of the appellant. The decision was made pursuant to s. 44(3) of the Trade Marks Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10 as amended, (now s. 45(3), R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13). By reason of the evidence filed the appeal raises directly the construction of s. 4(3) of the Act to deemed use in Canada of a trademark in export transactions.
[2]
The trademarks subject to expungement under this decision are registration no. 100,941 dated June 29, 1955, for the trademark "Molson's Golden Ale" & Design, registration no. 114,145 dated May 15, 1959, for the trademark "Golden Ale" & Design, and registration no. 161,252 dated February 14, 1969, for the trademark "Molson Golden Ale" & Design. The appellant was the registered owner of all three marks.
[3]
Proceedings under s. 44 were initiated following a request by representatives of the respondent, Moosehead Breweries Limited. Section 44 of the Act (now s. 45) provides:
"45(1) The Registrar may at any time and, at the written request made after three years from the date of the registration of a trademark by any person who pays the prescribed fee shall, unless he sees good reason to the contrary, give notice to the registered owner of the trademark requiring him to furnish within three months an affidavit or a statutory declaration showing, with respect to each of the wares or services specified in the registration, whether the trademark is in use in Canada and, if not, the date when it was last so in use and the reason for the absence of such use since that date.
"45(2) The Registrar shall not receive any evidence other than the affidavit or statutory declaration, but may hear representations made by or on behalf of the registered owner of the trademark or by or on behalf of the person at whose request the notice was given.
"45(3) Where, by reason of the evidence furnished to him or the failure to furnish any evidence, it appears to the Registrar that a trademark, either with respect to all of the wares or services specified in the registration or with respect to any of those wares or services, is not in use in Canada and that the absence of use has not been due to special circumstances that excuse the absence of use, the registration of the trademark is liable to be expunged or amended accordingly.
"45(4) When the Registrar reaches a decision whether or not the registration of a trademark ought to be expunged or amended, he shall give notice of his decision with the reasons therefor to the registered owner of the trademark and to the person at whose request the notice referred to in subsection (1) was given.
"45(5) The Registrar shall act in accordance with his decision if no appeal therefrom is taken within the time limited by this Act or, if an appeal is taken, shall act in accordance with the final judgment given in the appeal."
[4]
On June 30, 1980, a notice in relation to each of the trademarks was sent to the appellant in accord with s. 44(1). In response to each of the notices the appellant filed an affidavit sworn on December 16, 1980, by Douglas B. Ropp, then Distribution Manager of Molson's Brewery (Ontario) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the appellant, the Molson Companies Limited. To each affidavit was appended as an exhibit a copy of a label affirmed to have been affixed on bottles of brewed alcoholic beverages, namely ale, and in two affidavits affirmed also as affixed to the packages in which they were contained, when they were exported from Canada. Also attached to each affidavit was a copy of a document said to be an invoice, and two invoices in the case of the affidavit relating to trademark registration no. 161,252 under which some of the wares in question were exported from Canada.
[5]
At the request of the respondent an oral hearing was held before a hearing officer acting on behalf of the Registrar. Submissions and argument were heard from the appellant and from the respondent, including submissions about procedural defects perceived in the process by the appellant. The hearing officer dealt with procedural arguments and on the substance of issues before him concluded that the marks in question should be expunged from the Registry. In relation to the evidence before him, the affidavits and supporting documents from the appellant, the decision letter of the hearing officer concluded:
"On the question of the sufficiency of the evidence filed, I must agree with counsel for the requesting party to the effect that the evidence filed leaves much to be desired. Nowhere in the Ropp affidavits can I find a clear unequivocal assertion of use. The affidavits are couched in general terms and are ambiguous in their meaning. The invoices attached to the affidavits as supporting documents to show commercial transaction have been obliterated to the point of becoming meaningless. In the case of registration No. 161,252 even the date of the two invoices filed has been obliterated. In my respectful opinion, the registrant could have easily documented a few commercial transactions, if, indeed, such transactions had been effected at the material time, without jeopardizing its competitive position in the brewed alcoholic beverage industry. Alternatively, such information could have been made available to the Registrar on a confidential basis.
"Again, the labels filed as specimen labels alleged to have been used by the registrant in export trade, clearly indicate that the subject wares originated from Molson Breweries of Canada Limited of Montreal and  were intended for export sales to Martlet Importing Co. Inc., of Great Neck, New York, while the invoices filed to substantiate export transactions show sales to different importers located in different states and even in a different country.
"It seems clear to me, therefore, on the basis of the evidence filed, that the registrant has failed to show use of its subject trademarks, within the meaning of ss. 2, 4 and 44 of the Act, as judicially defined by the Federal Court of Canada and that these registrations ought to be expunged from the register. Registrations Nos. 100,941, 161,252 and 114,145 will be expunged accordingly, unless an appeal from this decision is initiated under the provisions of s. 56 of the Trade Marks Act within the prescribed time."
[6]
From this decision the appellant initiated this appeal by notice dated March 2, 1984. Subsequently, the appellant filed three further affidavits with supporting documentary evidence, all sworn by Douglas B. Ropp on March 14, 1984, as the appellant was entitled to do in connection with this appeal, pursuant to s. 56(5) of the Act. A reply in relation to the notice of appeal was filed by the respondent Moosehead, and also by the Deputy Attorney General of Canada on behalf of the Registrar of Trademarks in relation to the statement of material facts set out in the appellant's notice of appeal.
[7]
The corporate respondent also applied for an order pursuant to rule 704(7) for leave to cross-examine the affiant Douglas B. Ropp on his three affidavits sworn in March 1984 and filed on behalf of the appellant. That application was dismissed by Mr. Justice Strayer of this court in June 1984 and an appeal from that decision was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal on November 12, 1985 (Court File No. A-868-84).
[8]
In its notice of appeal of the decision on behalf of the Registrar the appellant raised several procedural grounds, some relating to jurisdiction of the Registrar, as well as grounds related to the merits of the decision to expunge. At the hearing, counsel for the appellant advised that issues related to procedural grounds, set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 in the notice of appeal, would not be pursued, and the hearing dealt with the merits of the decision to expunge the trademarks.
[9]
In the notice of appeal the appellant set out three errors alleged to have been made by the hearing officer but essentially those grounds of appeal relate to two primary issues. The first is the construction of s. 4(3), relating to trademarks in export transactions. The second is, in light of that construction, whether the affidavits and exhibits filed for consideration of the Registrar and those filed with the court subsequent to the decision appealed from meet the requirements of ss. 44(1) and 44(3).
[10]
In proceedings under s. 44 of the Act the onus is on the registered owner of the trademark to establish use of the trademark in Canada since only the registered owner is entitled to submit evidence for consideration by the Registrar or by the court. A helpful summary of general principles relating to s. 44 proceedings, and reference to decisions supporting these principles, is contained in the statement by my colleague Mr. Justice McNair of this court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 293 and 294 C.P.R. and pp. 313 and 314 F.T.R.:
"It is well-established that the purpose and scope of s. 44 is to provide a simple, summary and expeditious procedure for clearing the register of trademarks which are not bona fide claimed by their owners as active trademarks. The procedure has been aptly described as one for removing 'deadwood' from the register. The section does not contemplate a determination on the issue of abandonment but rather simply places on the registered owner of the  trademark the onus of furnishing evidence of use in Canada or of special circumstances excusing non-user. The registrar's decision is not one that finally determines substantive rights but only whether the trademark entry is liable to be expunged under s. 44 or not. If user is relied on then the evidence filed in response to the notice must 'show' the use or, at least, sufficiently relate the facts from which such use can be inferred. Mere statutory tracking in the nature of a bare statement that the registrant was currently using the trademark in the normal course of trade in association with the wares is insufficient to establish user unless coupled with facts that are descriptively corroborative of the same. Evidence of a single sale, whether wholesale or retail, in the normal course of trade may well suffice so long as it follows the pattern of a genuine commercial transaction and is not seen as being deliberately manufactured or contrived to protect the registration of the trademark. Evidence in response to a s. 44 notice should be forthcoming in quality, not quantity, and there is no need nor justification for evidentiary overkill: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 34 N.R. 39 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.)."
Use Of A Registered Trademark In Export Transactions: S. 4(3) Of The Act
[11]
The evidence presented by the appellant for consideration by the Registrar, and for the court in this appeal, relates almost exclusively to export transactions. It raises directly the interpretation of s. 4(3) of the Act. While it would have been relevant for the decision on behalf of the Registrar if offered, no evidence was presented to explain special circumstances concerning the absence of use and thus there is no question of special circumstances here.
[12]
Provisions of the Act particularly relevant in this case, in addition to s. 44, include these:
"2. In this Act
'trademark' means
(a) a mark that is used by a person for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him from those manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by others,
'use', in relation to a trademark, means any use that by s. 4 is deemed to be a use in association with wares or services.
"4(1) A trademark is deemed to be used in association with wares if, at the time of the transfer of the property in or possession of the wares, in the normal course of trade, it is marked on the wares themselves or on the packages in which they are distributed or it is in any other manner so associated with the wares that notice of the association is then given to the person to whom the property or possession is transferred.
"4(3) A trademark that is marked in Canada on wares or on the packages in which they are contained is, when the  wares are exported from Canada, deemed to be used in Canada in association with those wares."
[13]
The appellant Molson submits that s. 4(3) of the Act is to be interpreted independently of s. 4(1), that s. 4(3) is clear and unambiguous and requires, in the case of wares exported from Canada, that, if a trademark is to be deemed to be used in Canada in association with exported wares,
(a) the trademark be marked in Canada,
(b) on the wares or on the packages in which they are contained,
(c) when the wares are exported from Canada.
In this submission the appellant relies in part on the decision of my colleague Mr. Justice Pinard in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 486-487. In that case an appeal from the decision of the Registrar to expunge a registered trademark was allowed in relation to certain wares included in the registration where there was evidence of continuous export sales over nearly a decade and the sales abroad were made with packages and labels by which the trademark was affixed at the time of shipment from Canada. There, deemed use in Canada was found under s. 4(3) without reference to the conditions of s. 4(1) which were not argued as implied in s. 4(3).
[14]
The respondent Moosehead and the Attorney General for Canada, who intervened in the appeal alleging a public interest in the interpretation of the Act, with consent of the other parties and with leave of the court, submit that s. 4(3) is to be interpreted with the requirements of s. 4(1) implicitly included. The effect of this would be to incorporate requirements of s. 4(1) that the trademark be marked on the wares or packages at the time of transfer of property in or possession of the wares in the normal course of trade. In their arguments stress is put on the requirement that the transaction be in the normal course of trade as a qualification of use by export under s. 4(3).
[15]
In his reasons for order, dismissing the respondent Moosehead's application to cross-examine the affiant upon whose evidence the appellant relies, Mr. Justice Strayer said:
"The use deposed to here involves export of goods bearing the trademarks in question, as contemplated by s. 4(3) of the Act. This subsection does not contain the qualification 'in the normal course of trade' as does s. 4(1). This suggests that even isolated use with exported goods may be sufficient."
On appeal from that order to the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Mahoney for the court expressly dissociated the court from the comments of Strayer, J., by these words in his reasons for order:
"In his refusal, the learned trial judge gave reasons clearly expressing his conclusion on one of the issues raised in the appeal from the Registrar, namely, whether the use of a trademark as defined by s. 4(3) of the Act is subject to some or all of the conditions prescribed by s. 4(1). So far as we are aware that issue has not been authoritatively determined. We feel it necessary, in that circumstance, expressly to dissociate ourselves from the reasons of the learned trial judge. That said, we are not persuaded that he erred in exercising his discretion as he did."
[16]
In construing a statute the accepted principle, as stated by E.A. Driedger in Construction of Statutes (2nd Ed. 1983), at p. 87, is that
"... the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament."
This approach has been adopted in  numerous cases, including  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), per Heald, J., at p. 11 and MacGuigan, J., at p. 30. The plain meaning of the words is to be given effect unless that leads to an absurdity. Thus a court may not eliminate words or insert limiting words in a statute unless the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words leads to an absurdity, or a repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the enactment. (See Grand  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Davies, C.J., at 320; Driedger, supra, at pp. 94-100.)
[17]
In my view the plain meaning of s. 4(3), whether read by itself or in the context of the whole of s. 4 or of the Act as a whole, does not lead to an absurdity or an inconsistency with the rest of the enactment. It provides for a deemed use in Canada of a trademark affixed in this country to wares or the packages in which they are contained when those wares are exported from Canada. That is a use different from that provided for in s. 4(1), and it is a use which does not specifically refer to the conditions for use in Canada set out in s. 4(1) that the trademark be affixed when property in or possession of the wares is transferred in the normal course of trade.
[18]
It seems to me clear that s. 4(3), enacted in 1953 with the then new Trade Marks Act, Stats. Can. 1952-53, c. 49, replacing provisions of the Unfair Competition Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 274, which previously provided for regulation of trademarks in Canada, was intended to provide especially for deemed use in Canada of trademarks in export transactions, in particular to avoid the necessity of transfer of property in or possession of the wares in Canada. This change in the legislation relating to trademarks was made following the Report of the Trademark Law Revision Committee to the Secretary of State of Canada (January 20, 1953), part 12, which stated in part:
"We have received representations strongly urging that trademarks should be registrable for use on wares intended only for export because, in many foreign countries, a trademark cannot be registered by a person unless he has already obtained a registration in his home country. Thus, registration in Canada is in many cases necessary, in order to enable an exporter to obtain registration in the country to which he is to export. Under the present law, it is doubtful if a valid registration can be obtained in respect of a trademark used only on exported wares, because there may be no transfer of property or possession in Canada of such wares and consequently no use of the trademark in Canada on them ... Under the Bill, use or the making known of a trademark in Canada, or foreign registration coupled with use abroad, is a prerequisite to registration. Consequently, in order to give effect to the representations in questions, a special provision assimilating use of a trademark on exported goods to use of that trademark in Canada is required. This we have proposed in s. 4(3) of the Bill."
[19]
This Committee's Report makes no reference, in its discussion of trademarks in export transactions, to the other condition of s. 4(1), that the transaction involving wares marked with the trademark be "in the normal course of trade", and s. 4(3) as enacted makes no reference to that condition. It is submitted by the corporate respondent that s. 4(3) should not be construed as standing apart from s. 4(1) for that would lead to results that cannot have been intended by Parliament. To construe s. 4(3) literally and standing alone, it is said, would mean that upon export, there would be no requirement that there be a "transfer of the property in or possession of" the wares. Furthermore, if s. 4(3) were so construed, s. 4(2), relating to trademarks used in relation to services, would have to be similarly construed, yet registration and maintenance of  service marks could not have been intended except where the services were offered or performed in the normal course of trade. The Attorney General of Canada supports this interpretation and urges that the concept of use under s. 4(3) requires more than isolated use divorced from any bona fide commercial transaction. Further, it is urged that s. 4(3) was not intended to bring about a lower standard of use where wares were exported than when they entered into the domestic market and that s. 44 of the Trade Marks Act, providing a means for expunging inactive trademarks from the register could be frustrated if an isolated transaction divorced from any commercial reality could establish use.
[20]
In part these arguments relate to the meaning to be attributed to s. 4(3) and in part they relate to the sufficiency, or perceived lack of it, of evidence offered by the appellant in this case. I am not persuaded that they assist in construing s. 4(3), except insofar as they suggest logical possibilities of construing that provision divorced from commercial reality that would seem absurd in light of the general purpose of the Trade Marks Act. That purpose is clearly to provide for registration and regulation of trademarks used in commercial transactions, whether those be in domestic or international trade. That purpose in my view is met by construing the word "exported" in s. 4(3) as having a meaning beyond that based on the Latin derivation of the word "export" meaning to take away, carry off, or send out. In the context of the Trade Marks Act as a whole the words "exported from Canada" must be taken to mean "sent from Canada to another country in the way of commerce", or "transported from Canada to another country in the course of trade". (See "export": The Canadian Law Dictionary (1980), Black's Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979).)
[21]
In my view, s. 4(3) requires that the wares to which a trademark is affixed in Canada, or to their containing packages on which it is affixed, be sent out of Canada to another country in a commercial transaction, if use of the trademark on exported wares is to be deemed use in Canada. I do not interpret the section as incorporating the condition of s. 4(1), that the transaction be "in the normal course of trade".
[22]
I do not see this as necessarily a lower standard than that provided for use of a trademark by s. 4(1), though it be a different standard. Construction of s. 4(3) separate and apart from s. 4(1) is consistent with the plain meaning of s. 4(3) in the context of the Act as a whole. It is consistent with the decision of Pinard, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), where the Court of Appeal stated that s. 7(b) of the Act is to be interpreted in light of s. 4(3), so that an injunction granted to restrain unfair competition in accord with s. 7(b) extended to prohibition of manufacturing exclusively for export, a deemed use in Canada under s. 4(3), and this without any reference to whether export was in the normal course of trade. This construction is also implicitly consistent with certain decisions of the Trademarks Opposition Board, dealing in part with deemed use in Canada under s. 4(3) without any reference to whether the export of wares was in the normal course of trade: see Canada Wire and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 253;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 174.
[23]
It may be that in a given case of export transactions, deemed use in Canada can be established by evidence of an isolated, or a single, commercial transaction. Yet the same may be true in a given case in relation to use of a trademark under s. 4(1): see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per McNair, J., at 296-297  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), per MacGuigan, J.A., at p. 241.
The Evidence Of "Use" In This Case
[24]
As an alternative to its principal argument based on s. 4(3) standing separate and apart from s. 4(1), the appellant submits that the evidence provided in this case is sufficient to satisfy s. 4(3) if construed with the condition that the trademark be used in association with wares in the normal course of trade. The corporate respondent points to perceived insufficiencies of the evidence here to satisfy that condition, or in the alternative to satisfy s. 4(3) read without reference to s. 4(1). In view of my conclusion about the construction of s. 4(3) I deal with the evidence only in relation to that provision without reference to export transactions being in the normal course of trade.
[25]
The appellant relies solely on the evidence in support of maintaining registration provided by the affidavits of Douglas B. Ropp, now Director, Distribution of Molson Ontario Breweries Limited (formerly Molson's Brewery (Ontario) Limited), a registered user of all three trademarks here in issue. Three affidavits by Mr. Ropp, one relating to each registered trademark, all dated December 16, 1980, were filed for consideration of the Registrar, and three additional affidavits of Ropp, all dated March 14, 1984, one relating to each trademark, were filed following the decision on behalf of the Registrar, in relation to this appeal to the court. The later affidavits are considerably more explicit with reference to the particular transactions to which they refer, which transactions are said to be demonstrated by the exhibits attached.
[26]
The affiant's responsibilities relate to production volumes of beer, to inventory levels of beer both  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Ontario Breweries Limited and at Brewers Warehousing Company, and to coordination of shipments of brewed alcoholic beverages for export from Canada by his company and by Molson Breweries of Canada Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Molson Companies Limited and a registered user of trademarks no. 100,941 and no. 114,145. In relation to these two trademarks, Ropp avers that "when certain orders for brewed alcoholic beverages are received by Molson Breweries of Canada Limited, these orders are filled with my company's inventory, which is sold to Molson Breweries of Canada Limited and thereafter shipped from my company's brewery to the purchaser". He further avers that he is responsible with the packaging department of his company "for ensuring that the correct load, of the correct beverage, in bottles and packages bearing the correct labels, are shipped to the correct purchaser outside Canada". If there be an error in shipment of an order, Ropp is responsible in conjunction with the purchaser to correct it. In relation to trademark no. 161,252, Ropp's affidavit is that his responsibilities are the same when orders are received by his company from purchasers outside Canada.
[27]
In two of the original affidavits filed for consideration by the Registrar, relating to trademarks no. 100,941 and no. 114,145, but not in the later affidavits, Ropp also averred that:
"6. Molson Breweries of Canada Limited exports alcoholic brewery beverages from Canada to various countries throughout the world. Shipments of alcoholic brewery beverages to these various countries are regulated by, among other things, the amount of the previous shipment, by foreign demand, by the domestic laws of these foreign countries, and by other factors beyond the control of Molson Breweries of Canada Limited. Hence, in the normal course of trade, alcoholic brewery beverages are exported on a nonregular basis to certain foreign countries. The shipments evidenced by the attached invoice which is Exhibit 2 to this my affidavit is an example of one of these nonregular shipments  in the normal course of trade."
In the third of the original affidavits, relating to trademark no. 161,252, Ropp averred, in a paragraph relating to the label affixed on brewed alcoholic beverages, ale, when bottles were exported from Canada to the United States for the purpose of distinguishing these beverages from those of others, that "Shipments are made from Molson's Brewery (Ontario) Limited to the United States of America on a daily basis". Further, he stated that "brewed alcoholic beverages, namely Ale, are sold in Ontario through Brewers Warehousing Company in the normal course of trade containing label substantially identical to the label in Exhibit 1 ...". Again, those statements are not included in the later affidavit relating to trademark no. 161,252.
[28]
In relation to each of the trademarks in question the later affidavits include the following.
(1) In relation to trademark no. 100,941:
"3. Attached as Exhibit 1 to this my affidavit is a copy of a label which was affixed to bottles of brewed alcoholic beverages, namely ale, when that ale was shipped from my company's brewery to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd., of St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, on February 3, 1980. The said ale was brewed, bottled, and labelled with the label of Exhibit 1 by my company. I personally saw the label of Exhibit 1 on bottles of ale so shipped as above. The said ale was then sold by my company to Molson Breweries of Canada Limited, and thereafter sold, and shipped from my company's premises, to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd.
"4. Attached as Exhibit 2 to this my affidavit is a copy of Molson Breweries of Canada Limited invoice No. 2994, dated February 27, 1980, in respect of the shipment of ale to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd. outlined in paragraph 3 of this affidavit."
(2) In relation to trademark no. 114,145:
"3. Attached as Exhibit 1 to this my affidavit is a copy of a label which was affixed to bottles of brewed alcoholic beverages, namely ale, when that ale was shipped from my company's brewery to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd., of St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, on February 3, 1980. The said ale was brewed, bottled, and labelled with the label of Exhibit 1 by my company. I personally saw the label of Exhibit 1 on bottles of ale so shipped as above. The said ale was then sold by my company to Molson Breweries of Canada Limited, and thereafter sold, and shipped from my company's premises, to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd.
"4. Attached as Exhibit 2 to this my affidavit is a copy of Molson Breweries of Canada Limited invoice No. 2995, dated February 27, 1980, in respect of the shipment of ale to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd. outlined in paragraph 3 of this affidavit."
(3) In relation to trademark no. 161,252:
"3. Attached as Exhibit 1 to this my affidavit is a copy of a label which was affixed to bottles of brewed alcoholic beverages, namely ale, and the packages in which they were contained, when that ale was shipped from my company's brewery to Martlet Importing Co. Inc., c/o Valpo Beverages Inc., 825 Elm Street, P.O. Box 123, Valparaiso, Indiana, U.S.A. on June 20, 1980. The said ale was brewed, bottled, and labelled with the label of Exhibit 1 by my company. The said ale was then sold by my company to Martlet Importing Co. Inc. c/o Valpo Beverages Inc., 825 Elm Street, P.O. Box 123, Valparaiso, Indiana and shipped from my company's premises to Martlet Importing  Co. Inc., c/o Valpo Beverages Inc., 825 Elm Street, P.O. Box 123, in Valparaiso, Indiana, U.S.A.
"4. Attached as Exhibit 2 to this my affidavit is a copy of Molson's Brewery (Ontario) Limited invoice No. C01318, dated June 20, 1980, in respect of the sale and shipment of ale to Martlet Importing Co. Inc., c/o Valpo Beverages Inc., 825 Elm Street, P.O. Box 123, Valparaiso, Indiana outlined in paragraph 3 of this affidavit.
"5. The label of Exhibit 1 was also affixed to bottles of brewed alcoholic beverages, namely ale, and the packages in which they were contained, when that ale was shipped from my company's brewery to Martlet Importing Co. Inc., c/o Banko Beverage Co., 2124 Hanover Avenue, in Central Park Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. on April 28, 1980. The said ale was brewed, bottled, and labelled with the label of Exhibit 1 by my company, and the said ale was then sold by my company to Martlet Importing Co. Inc. and shipped from my company's premises to Martlet Importing Co. Inc., c/o Banko Beverage Co., 2124 Hanover Avenue in Central Park Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
"6. Attached as Exhibit 3 to this my affidavit is a copy of Molson's Brewery (Ontario) Limited invoice No. C00447, dated June 20, 1980, in respect of the sale and shipment of ale to Martlet Importing Co. Inc., c/o Banko Beverage Co., 2124 Hanover Avenue, in Central Park Allentown, Pennsylania, (sic) U.S.A. outlined in paragraph 5 of this affidavit."
(4) In relation to each of the trademarks in question:
"The quantity and price of the ale so shipped has been eliminated from the invoice [of Exhibit 2 in the affidavits relating to trademarks no. 100,941 and no. 114,145, and of Exhibits 2 and 3 in the affidavit relating to trademark no. 161,252] because this information is strictly confidential business information of my company and Molson Breweries of Canada Limited, the revealing of which would place my company and Molson Breweries of Canada Limited at a competitive disadvantage in the field of exporting brewed alcoholic beverages."
[29]
It is the last of these statements and invoices to which they respectively refer which give rise to particular concerns of the corporate respondent and of the Attorney General of Canada. The invoices offered as evidence of export sales in the case of trademarks no. 100,941 and no. 114,145 are similar invoices issued in the name of Molson Breweries of Canada Limited, made out, as the affidavits indicate, to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd. of a specified address St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, relating to two different orders placed by that company, both shipped to "Charbell/St. Thomas" on February 3, 1980, for which the invoicing date is February 27, 1980. In each case the shipment includes "24 NR Golden 4x6; 24 NR Golden/loose; 24 NR Golden Ale". The order numbers, provincial sales tax license numbers and the numbers relating to shipping company arrangements differ on these two invoices, and neither provides information to the uninitiated, including the court, in relation to the specific quantities or the prices of the wares shipped or to the value or the amount due on the wares for the copies of invoices filed are blank in relation to these details.
[30]
In the case of the third trademark, no. 161,252, two invoices are attached as exhibits to Ropp's affidavit. These are issued in the name of Molson's Brewery (Ontario) Limited relating to shipments to Martlet Importing Co. Inc. dated April 28, 1980 and June 20, 1980, as the dates completed with the exhibits filed with the second affidavit show, for the following: "Cases N.R.B. 4x6 Golden Ale  (1 case = 24 Btls/12 oz. ea.)". The shipments in question were made to the American Company at two different addresses, details of which are provided with invoices filed with the later affidavit, at Central Park Allentown, Pennsylvania and at Valparaiso, Indiana. In the original invoices filed the number of cases, the value, the weight, the volume, the number of returnable pallets in international traffic, the volume by imperial and U.S. gallons, the estimated costs of freight, the unit price and the amounts including the total all appear blank; in the copies of the same invoices filed with the later affidavit of Ropp these items all appear with the omitted information noted above blacked out as with a heavy marker. The invoices filed in both cases, with the first and with the later affidavit in relation to trademark no. 161,252, both indicate that it is "For Custom Purposes Only", both are certified as true copies of the original by someone other than the affiant signing on behalf of Molson's Brewery (Ontario) Limited, and all invoices include the statement
"This is a sale between related companies. Prices would be the same if unrelated, F.O.B. Toronto plant via distributors own truck."
[31]
The corporate respondent submits that all the invoices filed in this matter are inadmissible under the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, ss. 30(1) and (3) which provide for admission of business records or copies of those where the originals are not readily available with affidavits setting out the reasons why the originals are not available and setting out the source of the copy and attesting to its authenticity. Moreover, it is pointed out that the copies of invoices here provided are incomplete, excluding as they do certain information including the volume and the price of wares shipped. However, in the later affidavits of Ropp the copies are identified as invoices of certain Molson companies, in each case a registered user of the trademark affixed to wares, sold by those companies and shipped from Canada, to which the invoices relate. I am not prepared to exclude the invoices here presented; it seems to me they are clearly copies of records made in the regular course of business by the companies concerned and though they be incomplete copies they do support the appellant's contention that the wares in question were shipped from Canada and sold to companies, in the United States in the case of trademark no. 161,252 and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a territory of the United States, in the case of the other two trademarks.
[32]
I do not accept the submission of the corporate respondent that in the cases of trademarks no. 100,941 and no. 114,145 there is no evidence of a sale of the wares or the submission that shipments of wares bearing trademark no. 161,252 to a related company should be disregarded. In the later affidavits of Ropp in relation to the first two trademarks he states:
"... ale was shipped from my company's brewery to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd., of St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, on February 3, 1980. The said ale was brewed, bottled and labelled with the label of Exhibit 1 by my company. I personally saw the label of Exhibit 1 on bottles of ale so shipped as above. The said ale was then sold by my company to Molson Breweries of Canada Limited, and thereafter sold, and shipped from my company's premises, to Charles Bellows & Co. Ltd."
In somewhat similar terms, his later affidavit concerning trademark no. 161,252 states that ale bearing this trademark was shipped from his company's brewery to Martlet Importing Co. Inc. at its Indiana address on June 20, 1980, and to the same company at its Pennsylvania address on April 28, 1980, and that in both cases the ale shipped was sold by his company to Martlet at its respective addresses and shipped to those addresses from his company's premises. The invoices presented to document these two sales do include the statement in each case that the sale is between related companies, but it also  includes the statement that prices would be the same if the companies were unrelated. That full statement made for customs purposes must be considered. Though the companies were related there is no evidence before me that the sales averred to by Ropp, made to a company in the United States, were other than bona fide sales.
[33]
In my view the affidavits of Ropp and supporting exhibits, particularly the later ones filed in this appeal after the decision made on behalf of the Registrar, do show that the requirements of s. 4(3) of the Trade Marks Act are met for deemed use in Canada of trademarks affixed in Canada to wares or the packages in which they were contained when the wares were exported, in a commercial transaction, from Canada.
[34]
In relation to trademarks no. 100,941 and no. 114,145 the corporate respondent argues that the evidence presented shows only use in each case at February 3, 1980, the date of shipment of the exported wares, more than four months before the s. 44 notice to the appellant on June 30, 1980. No evidence of more than a single sale has been provided and there is no reference to other sales either before or after the notice. It is submitted this evidence fails to show user at the appropriate time, the date when the notice issued, and on this ground the registrations of these two trademarks should be expunged.
[35]
The date when the notice issued under s. 44 is not a fixed and definite date to coincide with demonstrated user of a registered trademark. The task of the Registrar under s. 44 is to determine, on the basis of evidence submitted by or on behalf of the registered owner within three months of receipt of notice, whether the trademark is in use, or if not whether there are special circumstances that excuse the absence of use. For this purpose, evidence of use before or after the date of notice under s. 44 may be provided. Evidence of a single transaction may be sufficient to demonstrate use in the case of s. 4(1) at least where the court is satisfied that the transaction is in the normal course of trade (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  single transaction in export trade should not be accepted to demonstrate deemed use in Canada under s. 4(3) of the Act, assuming that transaction is a commercial transaction in export trade.
[36]
In this case the original affidavits considered by Mr. D'Aoust on behalf of the Registrar in relation to the first two trademarks do refer to what Ropp described as the "nonregular basis" of export trade with some foreign countries, or in this case territories, which I understand to mean that it was not on a daily, weekly or any other regular pattern though it continued over time. Taking this into account and having concluded that the evidence here demonstrates one or more commercial transactions in export trade in wares to which the trademarks were affixed in Canada, I also conclude that the evidence of the transactions more than four months prior to the issue of the notice under s. 44 is sufficiently timely to satisfy the test of user at the time appropriate in this case.
[37]
The corporate respondent urges that the evidence should not be relied upon if it can be "seen as somehow lacking in bona fides being, so to speak, 'manufactured' in an attempt to protect the registration rather than establish genuine use of the trademark in the normal course of trade", as Stone, J., commented in obiter in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 235. I accept that principle but in my view it has no application here for there is no evidence that the affidavits and exhibits filed on behalf of the appellant were "manufactured" to protect the registration. While it is true that the task of the Registrar, and of this court, would have been easier if the appellant had provided more information  about the nature, volume, value and continuity of export trade in the wares here in question, it is well-settled that there is no need for evidentiary overkill. The decision about the evidence to be provided is that of the registered owner invited to respond to the notice issued under s. 44 of the Act. I am not prepared to draw a negative inference about the bona fides of the appellant here simply from its choice to provide evidence of only one or two export transactions using the trademarks in question, or from the appellant's decision to delete from copies of invoices relating to those transactions information it considered confidential about the volume, value or price of the wares sold. As Mahoney, J., indicated, when the Court of Appeal dealt with the corporate respondent's appeal from Strayer, J.'s, decision not to permit cross-examination of Ropp on his affidavits:
"If the respondent's (i.e., Molson's) good faith in exporting its products in association with the trademarks is an issue, the matter should be resolved in an expungement proceeding under s. 57, not in a proceeding under s. 44 which is designed primarily to clear the register of dead wood, not to resolve issues in contention between competing commercial interests." ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A-868-84, Reasons for Order at p. 2.)
Conclusion
[38]
It has long been settled that the role of the court in considering an appeal from a decision of the Registrar in a s. 44 proceeding is to review all the evidence presented for the court, but the decision of the Registrar ought not to be reversed unless it is apparent that the decision was wrong. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 197 (F.C.T.D.).)
[39]
The corporate respondent submits that the evidence before this court does not differ significantly from the evidence before the Registrar. I do not agree. In my view the later affidavits of Ropp filed in this appeal after the decision on behalf of the Registrar are considerably more precise than his original affidavits considered by the hearing officer for the Registrar. That precision relates to designating the exporting company as a wholly owned subsidiary of the appellant and as a registered user of the trademark in question, to the personal observation by the affiant of labels bearing the respective trademarks being affixed by the affiant's company to bottles and packages of bottles containing the wares in which these were exported from Canada in a sale of the wares to companies operating in a foreign country. The sales from the affiant's company to another Molson Company, a registered user of the trademarks and the sale by the latter to a foreign company and shipment to the foreign company are also outlined in the later affidavits.
[40]
On the basis of the evidence filed in and with the later affidavits of Ropp, it is my conclusion that the appellant has met the necessary standard of proof of use under s. 4(3) for recognition as a deemed user of the trademarks in question. It has thus met the requirements of ss. 44(1) and 44(3), and the decision made on behalf of the Registrar cannot stand.
[41]
In these circumstances an order will go allowing the appeal by Molson's, quashing the decision of Mr. D'Aoust, made on behalf of the Registrar and maintaining registration of the trademarks nos. 100,941, 114,145 and 161,252 on the Register of Trademarks. The appellant will have its costs in this appeal.
Appeal allowed.
