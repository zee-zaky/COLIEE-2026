Joyal, J.
: This is an appeal from a decision of a Citizenship Judge sitting in Ottawa, refusing the appellant's application for Canadian citizenship.
[2]
The grounds for refusal, as set out in the written reasons of the learned judge and communicated to the appellant on March 12, 1992 was the appellant's failure to comply with s. 5(1)(d) of the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 which requires of an applicant an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada.
[3]
The appellant comes from Lebanon. She lived with her family in a small village. Although Lebanon generally enjoys both French and English speaking schools, and French is the accepted second language, the available institutions in her village were Arabic and religious.
[4]
The appellant dropped out of school when she married at the age of sixteen. Seven children were born of the marriage. One of the children, a son named Oussama, was stricken with polio at an early age and became permanently disabled.
[5]
The appellant came to Canada in 1984 and was granted permanent landing on January 6 of that year. The husband, who is now 73 years of age, had settled in Canada a month earlier and the whole family was reunited at that time. In due course, the appellant's husband and each of her children were granted Canadian citizenship.
[6]
At the hearing of her appeal, it was disclosed that the appellant's sole occupation, since her establishment in Canada, has been to take care of her family, including of course her husband Ahmad and her disabled son Oussama. She has had no other interests in life. Yet, in spite of her obvious language difficulties, she has managed to assume control of her household in a thorough fashion. She shops in neighbourhood stores and shopping centres for food, she visits local markets and looks after the multitude of purchases of one kind or another for all their household needs. She uses public transportation and knows how to get around the city of Ottawa.
[7]
The appellant was examined at length by her representative, Ms. Leila Mansour, and by counsel appointed as amicus curiae, Mr. David Casey. Although the appellant required interpretation from time to time, it appeared to the court that she generally understood the questions put to her in English and would spontaneously reply in the Arabic language and sometimes in English. A one-way knowledge of language, so to speak.
[8]
Further skillful questioning by the amicus curiae brought out a relatively adequate knowledge of Canada's federal system and public institutions. She knew political leaders by name and knew personally her own Member of Parliament.
[9]
It was also disclosed that the applicant's academic learning skills had not been put to the test since she had left school at the age of sixteen. She had recently made an effort at learning English by attending an E.S.L. course in one of Ottawa's schools, but her wheelchair-bound disabled son had suffered a leg fracture at that time and, since he required full-time special care and attendance, she had abandoned the course.
[10]
It will be gleaned from the foregoing facts that there is present a very favourable image of an applicant who, since the age of sixteen, has devoted her entire life to the essential role of looking after her husband and raising her many children. To this was added the burden of special care for her disabled son. With her limited schooling, she had not been readily disposed to seek higher levels of education. One might surmise that in her particular circumstances, she would nevertheless have found it difficult to be a housekeeper and still find time for esoteric pursuits. Futhermore, the exclusive role which housewives and mothers are traditionally called upon to exercise in so many other parts of the world is not automatically changed or adjusted upon being transplanted to Canadian soil, where such a role is often regarded as somewhat less than glamorous. There are cultural characteristics (or virtues?) made evident by immigrants that no statutory social or educational programme can effectively metamorphose into more contemporary or fashionable lifestyles.
[11]
This analysis, of course, only underlines the more human characteristics which the applicant would ask the court to consider. Nevertheless, there are conditions which Parliament has seen fit to impose on applicants for Canadian citizenship. Perhaps this is a reflection of how highly is viewed a grant of citizenship to landed immigrants, a privilege which should not be awarded merely on the asking. Conditions include therefore a minimum residency period, good conduct free of criminal convictions, a sufficient knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship and, as in the case before me, an adequate knowledge of one of our official languages.
[12]
In this latter issue, the learned Citizenship Judge found that the appellant had failed the test. Furthermore, the learned Judge found that there were no facts or circumstances which would give rise to the exercise by the Minister of his discretion to grant citizenship on compassionate grounds under s. 5(3)(a) or s. 5(4) of the
Citizenship Act
, and accordingly, the Citizenship Judge decided to recommend that citizenship not be granted to the appellant.
[13]
In this respect, two jurisprudential issues were raised by the amicus curiae. One is found in the matter of
Hokayem, Re
(1990), 37 F.T.R. 49 (T.D.), where my colleague Rouleau, J., stated that the Judge below, on deciding not to recommend citizenship on compassionate grounds, had failed to indicate what were considered as the relevant factors. Rouleau, J., also noted that on the evidence before him, he would have had no hesitations in making such a recommendation to the Minister, but on the strength of divided opinion in the Federal Court as to whether it was within his competence to make such a recommendation, he had decided to return the matter to the Citizenship Court to consider his own findings and to decide whether or not to recommend that the Minister's discretion be exercised in a manner favourable to the appellant.
[14]
The other case cited to me was in the matter of
Elangange, Re
(1991), 45 F.T.R. 152 (T.D.), where Cullen, J., had to consider a Citizenship Court refusal under s. 5(1)(e) of the
Act
, which deals with knowledge of Canadian institutions, its geography and the duties and rights of citizenship. The appellant had passed the language proficiency test and as to evidence, had made serious efforts to learn more about Canada. Cullen, J., after reviewing the whole background of the appellant and outlining the limited opportunities given to her, concluded that citizenship should be granted to her and he allowed the appeal.
[15]
The facts before me raise similar factors as were before Rouleau, J. and Cullen, J. There are indeed humanitarian or compassionate grounds on which a favourable recommendation to the Minister might be made. I could even go further and, in adopting a more liberal interpretation of s. 5(1)(d) of the
Act
, rule that the appellant meets the requirements of that section and that her appeal be allowed.
[16]
On reflection, however, I would form a more diffident approach to the role of a Citizen Court. It is a matter of curial respect for citizenship judges who deal with hundreds of applications and who must necessarily apply the tests imposed with a degree of consistency as will better maintain the credibility of the process.
[17]
I would therefore allow the appeal on the strength of the evidence before me that the appellant's situation, as far as language is concerned, is border-line case and that, in any event, it would be incumbent on the Citizenship Court to consider the humanitarian or compassionate circumstances I have outlined in these reasons.
[18]
I mentioned earlier that conditions for a grant of citizenship are imposed to reflect the very important status which Canadian citizenship confers on an applicant. Citizenship is not meant to be a freebie. The
Act
provides, however, that in keeping with human and caring values which are part of the Canadian mosaic, exceptions to the more didactic requirements may be made and a recommendation submitted to the Minister accordingly. Furthermore, having put the appellant through the stress of an original hearing before the Citizenship Court and a subsequent hearing before me, it could not be said that citizenship in her case would be summarily or easily granted.
[19]
It is on the basis of all of the foregoing that I return the record to the Citizenship Judge.
Appeal allowed.
