Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2003] F.T.R. TBEd. SE.020.
[1]
Layden-Stevenson, J.
: Genealogy is the applicant's hobby. She wishes to see the nominal returns of the 1911 census of Canada, specifically Alberta, to learn more about her grandfather. In November 1999 and September 2000, the national archivist requested that the chief statistician transfer the 1911 census to the National Archives of Canada. The census records in issue have not been made available to the public.
THE MOTION
[2]
The applicant, in her notice of application, seeks an order compelling the chief statistician to transfer the nominal returns and schedules of the 1911 census of Canada to the national archivist and further, and in the alternative, an order directing or alternatively permitting the national archivist to make this information available to the public for research purposes. Further, and in the alternative, the applicant seeks declarations that:
(a) the national archivist, and not the chief statistician, has care and control of the records from the 1911 census;
(b) in the alternative, if the chief statistician does have care and control of the records from the 1911 census, then the chief statistician is under a legal obligation to transfer control of these records to the national archivist;
(c) further, upon being declared to be in care and control of the records from the 1911 census or upon being transferred control of such records, the national archivist has the power to disclose this information to members of the public, upon request, for research purposes.
[3]
The respondents, by this motion, seek to strike the underlying notice of application and to have it dismissed on the ground that it is bereft of any chance of success and therefore clearly improper. The primary basis of the motion is that the applicant cannot satisfy a fundamental condition for an order for mandamus to issue. Similarly, because the requirements for a declaration are the same as those for mandamus, the applicant cannot possibly succeed.
BACKGROUND
[4]
The parties provided an outline of the historical statutory framework relevant to this matter and although it is unnecessary, for purposes of the motion, to review it in detail here, the synopsis provided by both counsel was helpful. As I understand their positions, the parties agree that the legislation applicable to the 1911 census is the Census and Statistics Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 68 (the 1906 Act). Provisions regarding the non-publication of individual returns first appeared in the Statistics Act, 8-9 GV, S.C. 1918, c. 43 (the 1918 Act) and were carried forward through subsequent amendments to the 1918 Act until 1971 when the confidentiality requirement was drafted in terms that are the same as those set out in section 17 of the Statistics Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-19 (the present Act). Also relevant, for present purposes, are the National Archives of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 and the Privacy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-21.
RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS
[5]
The relevant statutory provisions are reproduced and attached to these reasons as Schedule "A". Section 6 of the National Archives of Canada Act (NACA) is pivotal to the submissions of the parties. For ease of reference, that section is set out here.
National Archives of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1
6. (1) The records of government institutions and ministerial records that, in the opinion of the Archivist, are of historic importance shall be transferred to the care and control of the Archivist in accordance with such schedules or other agreements for the transfer of records as may be agreed on between the Archivist and the government institution or person responsible for the records.
(2) The Governor in Council may, by regulation, prescribe terms and conditions governing the transfer of records under subsection (1).
(3) Except as otherwise directed by the Governor in Council, the Archivist shall have the care and control of all records of any government institution the functions of which have ceased.
Loi sur les Archives nationales du Canada, S.R.C. 1985, c. 1
6. (1) Le transfert, sous la garde et le contrôle de l'archiviste, des documents des institutions fédérales et des documents ministériels qu'il estime avoir une importance historique ou archivistique s'effectue selon les calendriers ou accords convenus à cet effet entre l'archiviste et le responsable des documents.
(2) Le gouverneur en conseil peut, par règlement, fixer les modalités du transfert des documents.
(3) Sauf instruction contraire du gouverneur en conseil, l'archiviste est préposé à la garde et au contrôle des documents des institutions fédérales qui ont cessé leurs activités.
ISSUE
[6]
The issue is whether the applicant's notice of application is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success.
THE LAW
[7]
The cornerstone authority regarding motions to strike applications for judicial review is  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.). The basic principles articulated in David Bull may be succinctly stated as follows:
(a) a trial judge's exercise of discretion on a motion to strike an application will not be interfered with unless the judge has proceeded on some wrong principle of law, has seriously misapprehended the facts, or unless an obvious injustice would otherwise result;
(b) the direct and proper way to contest an originating notice of application that a respondent thinks to be without merit is to appear and argue at the hearing of the application;
(c) a notice of application will be dismissed summarily only in circumstances where it is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success. Such cases will be very exceptional.
[8]
The applicant aptly expresses the test in colloquial terms and submits that even if I do not agree with her arguments, she has to be "dead in the water" before the respondents' motion can succeed.
ANALYSIS
[9]
Although the court will rarely dismiss summarily a notice of application, it has been so ordered where the court lacked jurisdiction because an applicant could have utilized a statutory grievance:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) or because an applicant challenged a decision not made by a federal board, commission or tribunal:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), aff'd (1999), 247 N.R. 295 (F.C.A.) or challenged what was not, in fact, a decision:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) or because it was clear that an applicant could not satisfy the conditions for the issuance of mandamus:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or because precisely the same issue had been litigated in previous applications:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.T.).
i) Transfer of census returns to the national archivist
[10]
The respondents contend that the objective of the application is to provide the applicant with access to the 1911 census records and that neither the conditions for mandamus nor declaratory relief can be satisfied. Relying on Rocky Mountain Ecosystem, supra, the respondents refer to subsection 6(1) of NACA and submit that the chief statistician's obligation to transfer care and control of the census returns to the national archivist is subject to the terms of an agreement, between the chief statistician and the national archivist, governing the transfer. The manner or time frame for reaching an agreement is not stipulated. Thus, in the absence of an agreement, the respondents submit that the chief statistician is under no obligation to transfer care and control of the 1911 census returns to the national archivist. This conditional nature of the obligation under subsection 6(1) is reflected and reinforced by section 8 of the Privacy Act. Regarding the latter, the respondents note that the language is permissive. Hence, absent the chief statistician's consent to transfer the records, there is no obligation to do so. Further, argue the respondents, any duty allegedly owed is to the national archivist, not the applicant. It follows that the applicant fails to meet the requirements for mandamus as well as for declaratory relief in respect of the chief statistician's obligation to transfer care and control of the 1911 census returns to the national archivist.
[11]
While the respondents' submissions appear compelling, they do not address the responsive arguments of the applicant. I am mindful of the respondents' position that the applicant's evidence on the motion is considerably "beefed up" over that filed in support of the application. I agree that is the case and I therefore disregard evidence that was not filed in relation to the application. The applicant's legal arguments, however, are another matter and are appropriately open for consideration. My reasoning proceeds on the premise that the 1911 census records are governed by the provisions of the 1906 Act, as agreed by the parties.
[12]
The applicant argues that the chief statistician is without legal authority and is in breach of federal law in purporting to retain custody and control of the nominal returns and schedules for the 1911 census and in refusing to transfer custody of them to the national archivist upon the demand of the latter. Reliance on subsection 6(1) of NACA is cited in partial support of this position. However, the applicant also submits that section 3 of the 1906 Act (pursuant to which the 1911 census was conducted) provided for the creation of a permanent office under the Minister of Agriculture and that section 3 of the 1918 Act created a new government department under the Minister of Trade and Commerce, the "Dominion Bureau of Statistics". "Statistics Canada" was not the government institution that collected the 1911 census information. Rather, it was a now-defunct office under the Minister of Agriculture known as the "Census and Statistics Office". By virtue of having ceased its functions, the applicant contends that the records of the "Census and Statistics Office" revert to the care and control of the national archivist pursuant to subsection 6(3) of NACA.
[13]
The applicant also refers to and relies upon the recommendation contained in the Order of the Privy Council dated November 30, 1903, creating the position of "Dominion Archivist", wherein it specifically states that "... everything in the archives branch of the Department of Agriculture" is to be "put into the custody" of the Dominion Archivist. At all relevant times, says the applicant, the "Census and Statistics Office" was part of the Department of Agriculture and there exists no legal authority, of which the applicant is aware, for "Statistics Canada" to have care and control of records from the 1911 census.
[14]
Moreover, contends the applicant, it must have been Parliament's intention, at the time of the 1911 census, that the federal archives would be the permanent storehouse for the census returns when regard is had to the 1911 Instructions to Commissioners and Enumerators, prescribed under section 6 of the 1906 Act, which specifically refer to the census as having value as a record for historical use (section 16) and as a permanent record with its schedules stored in the archives of the Dominion (section 36). There is no reference to "Statistics Canada", the chief statistician, or their predecessors holding the 1911 census records. It is NACA that delineates the objects and functions of the National Archives and conservation of the records with the National Archives as the repository. The applicant reiterates that the current secrecy provisions do not apply to the 1906 Act. The only reference to confidentiality in relation to the 1911 census is found in section 23 of the 1911 Instructions which, it is submitted, refers to concerns such as taxation, immigration status or business data. Perpetual confidentiality was neither assumed nor intended.
[15]
In my view, in the face of the applicant's submissions, it is not possible for me to conclude that the applicant is, at this stage, "dead in the water". Indeed, counsel for the respondents, at the hearing, conceded that should I accept the applicant's position that the national archivist has de jure care and control of the 1911 census records, the motion could not succeed. With respect, for purposes of this motion, I need not determine the ultimate merits of the applicant's position; I need only determine whether that position is bereft of any possibility of success. I am unable to conclude that such is the case. The applicant raises issues that require an examination of the evolution of the legislation as well as an interpretation of it.
[16]
Regarding the hurdle that the duty must be owed to the applicant,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  are relied upon, by the applicant, in support of the proposition that the court has a discretion to recognize public interest standing to bring an action for mandamus where there is a public interest to be expressed and there is no other reasonable way for it to be brought to court. While the applicant may experience difficulty succeeding in this respect, difficulty is not the test. The issue is arguable and the applicant is entitled to make her argument to the judge assigned to hear the application for judicial review and have it determined on its merits. The circumstances in Rocky Mountain Ecosystem, supra, do not resemble those that the applicant alleges exist here. While that authority contains an exposition of the law regarding the remedy of mandamus in circumstances where there is a discretionary duty involved, it does not assist the respondents in relation to the arguments advanced by the applicant.
[17]
In summary, it is far from clear to me that the applicant is, at this point, "dead in the water". That is not to say that the respondents' arguments lack substance. Rather, they fail to satisfy the onerous test of establishing that the applicant's arguments are so without merit as to be bereft of any possibility of success.
ii) Public release of census returns
[18]
The respondents submit that when the national archivist obtains care and control of government records, he is authorized, but not required, to provide access to those records, subject to any lawful restriction that applies (NACA, section 4). The lawful restriction that expressly governs access to census returns is found in section 6 of the Privacy Regulations. This provision is not mandatory. It does not require that personal information transferred to the control of the national archives be disclosed to any person or body for research or statistical purposes. It states that it "may" be disclosed for these purposes. Thus, the respondents, again relying on Rocky Mountain Ecosystem, supra, contend that mandamus is not available because the duty sought to be enforced is discretionary. Since mandamus will not lie to compel the doing of an act that the national archivist is not under a duty to perform, the respondents say that the applicant cannot seek an order compelling the national archivist to make the 1911 census records publicly available. Because the chief statistician has no authority to provide public access to the records, it cannot be ordered that he do so.
[19]
The applicant counters that upon receipt of the 1911 census, the national archivist has the power to disclose the information to members of the public, upon request, for research purposes. In the exercise of a discretion, the decision-maker must not act in a manner that can be characterized as "unfair" or "oppressive", or that demonstrates "flagrant impropriety" or "bad faith". The applicant recognizes that it may be said that the remedy is available only with respect to the chief statistician as the national archivist does not have possession of the 1911 census records and therefore cannot fairly be demanded or required to deliver possession of something he does not have. However, the applicant relies on her arguments referred to earlier and maintains that while the chief statistician purports to have care and control of the 1911 census records, the national archivist has the legal care and control and therefore, her request is legitimate.
[20]
The applicant reiterates her previous arguments in relation to standing and further submits, by relying upon various provisions of the Access to Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1, that no other adequate remedy is available.
[21]
In my view, it is clear that only the national archivist can provide public access to the records in issue. The chief statistician has no authority to do so and the applicant does not dispute that the latter lacks the power to make the 1911 census records available to the public for research purposes. Accordingly, a request that the court direct the chief statistician to perform such an act cannot succeed and is therefore bereft of any possibility of success.
[22]
It is equally clear, from the legislation, that the authority of the national archivist is discretionary. While I understand and appreciate the applicant's position with respect to the exercise of that discretion, it seems to me that those arguments can have no application until such time as the national archivist fails, or refuses, to make the records available. The submission that the national archivist has legal care and control does not assist the applicant because it assumes success in relation to what has yet to be determined on the hearing of the application. Thus, a request for an order directing the national archivist to make the records available to the public for research purposes is premature and cannot succeed. It, too, is bereft of any possibility of success.
[23]
Regarding the requests for declarations, the respondents maintain that the applicant has not met the conditions for mandamus and therefore cannot qualify for declaratory relief. The applicant relies upon  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) and submits that the requirements for a declaration simpliciter are not the same as those for mandamus. The applicant says that she must show that the question at issue is real and not theoretical, that she has a real interest to raise and that there is a proper contradictor. Neither counsel developed their respective arguments in this regard to any significant degree. I do not propose to dispose of the motion on the basis of grounds that were not fully argued.
[24]
In the result, the motion is allowed to the extent that the request, in the notice of application, for an order directing that the chief statistician and the national archivist make the nominal returns and schedules of the 1911 census of Canada available to the public for research purposes is struck. In all other respects, the motion is dismissed and an order will so provide.
[25]
The respondents request 30 days from the date of my order within which to file their responsive affidavit(s). The applicant urges me to provide a much shorter period of time. The respondents will have 15 days within which to file any responsive affidavit(s). Success has been divided. There will be no order regarding costs.

2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,
(a) 'Minister' means the Minister of Agriculture;
(b) 'Office' means the Census and Statistics Office.
3. There shall be a permanent office under the Minister of Agriculture, to be called the Census and Statistics Office, and the Governor in Council may appoint thereto a chief officer, a secretary, and such other officers, clerks and employees as are necessary for the proper conduct of the office, whose duties under the direction of the Minister shall be to carry out the provisions of this Act, and such other duties as are assigned to them by the Governor in Council.
4. The Governor in Council may also appoint such census officers, census commissioners and other employees as are necessary for the taking of each census, with such relative powers and duties and such emoluments as are laid down for each census by order in council.
6. The Minister may also employ from time to time such agents or persons as are necessary to collect for the Office statistics and information relating to such industries and affairs of the country as he deems useful and in the public interest, and the duties of such agents or persons shall be such as the Minister determines.
10. The details of information, and procedure to be followed for the obtaining thereof, the forms to be used, and the period at which, and the dates with reference to which, the census shall be taken or statistics and information collected, whether generally or for any specified localities requiring to be exceptionally dealt with in any of these respects, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be such as the Governor in Council by proclamation directs.
11. A census of Canada shall be taken by the Office, under the direction of the Minister, on a date in the month of June, in the year one thousand nine hundred and eleven, to be fixed by the Governor in Council, and every tenth year thereafter.
16. Every enumerator, by visiting every house and by careful personal inquiry, shall ascertain, in detail with the utmost possible accuracy, all the statistical information with which he is required to deal, and no other, and shall make an exact record thereof, and attest the same under oath, and shall see that such attested record is duly delivered to the census commissioner under whose superintendence he is placed.
2. The enumerator shall execute this section, in all respects, as required by the forms and instructions issued to him.
34. Every officer, census commissioner, enumerator, agent and other person employed in the execution of this Act, before entering on his duties, shall take and subscribe an oath binding him to the faithful and exact discharge of such duties and to the secrecy of statistics and information collected for the Office.

Fifth Census of Canada, 1911 Instructions to Officers, Commissioners and Enumerators
16. If an unincorporated village is included in the enumerator's district he should take the Census of it separately from the rural portion proper, but on the same schedule. A short line drawn across the left hand margin above the number of the first family and another below the number of the last family of the village as entered on the schedule, will be a sufficient mark of separation. But if the village have a distinct name it should be written along the left hand margin of the schedule, between the upper and lower lines, on each page until the enumeration of such village is completed. ... This separation will facilitate the tabulation of agricultural statistics, and it will have value as a record for historical use in tracing the origin and rise of future towns in the country. The Census of unincorporated villages however will be included as heretofore with the statistics of rural sections.
23. Every officer or other person employed in any capacity on Census work is required to keep inviolate the secrecy of the information gathered by the enumerators and entered on the schedules or forms. An enumerator is not permitted to show his schedules to any other person, nor to make or keep a copy of them, nor to answer any questions respecting their contents, directly or indirectly; and the same obligation of secrecy is imposed upon commissioners and other officers or employees of the outside service, as well as upon every officer, clerk, or other employee of the Census Office at Ottawa. The facts and statistics of the Census may not be used except for statistical compilations, and positive assurance should be given on this point if a fear is entertained by any person that they may be used for taxation or any other object.
36. The enumerator is required to make all entries on the schedules in ink of good quality, and every name, word, figure or mark should be clear and legible. If a schedule cannot be read, or if the entries are made with a poor quality of ink, or in pencil, or if they are blurred or blotted, the work of the enumerator may be wholly wasted. The Census is intended to be a permanent record, and its schedules will be stored in the Archives of the Dominion ...

3. Est établi, sous l'autorité du ministre de l'Agriculture, un bureau permanent appelé le bureau de recensement et des statistiques, et le gouverneur en conseil peut y nommer, pour le bon fonctionnement du service, un chef, un secrétaire et les autres fonctionnaires, commis et employés nécessaires, lesquels, sous la direction du Ministre, sont chargés de mettre à exécution les dispositions de la présente loi et les autres fonctions à eux assignés par le gouverneur en conseil.
4. Le gouverneur en conseil peut aussi nommer les officiers de recensement, commissaires de recensement et autres employés nécessaires pour chaque recensement, et leur sont respectivement attribués les pouvoirs, fonctions et émoluments déterminés à eux assignés par le gouverneur en conseil.
6. Le Ministre peut aussi employer à toute époque les agents ou personnes nécessaires pour recueillir pour le bureau, des statistiques et renseignements au sujet d'industries et d'affaires du pays qu'il juge être utiles et dans l'intérêt du public, et les attributions de ces agents sont à la détermination du Ministre.
10. Les détails des renseignements, les moyens à mettre en oeuvre pour les obtenir, les formules à employer à l'époque à laquelle s'effectue le recensement, ainsi que les dates relativement auxquelles il se fait ou sont recueillis les statistiques et les renseignements, soit pour le pays en général soit pour quelques localités particulières, qui demandent à être traitées d'une manière spéciale sous l'un de ces rapports, sont, en conformité des dispositions de la présente loi, selon que déterminés par proclamation du gouverneur en conseil.

Cinquième Recensement du Canada, 1911 Instructions à l'usage des fonctionnaires, commissaires et recenseurs
16. Si un village qui n'est pas constitué en municipalité est compris dans le district du recenseur, ce dernier doit en faire le recensement séparément, en dehors de la partie rurale proprement dite, mais sur le même tableau. Une ligne courte tracée en travers de la marge de gauche au-dessus du numéro de la première famille et une autre au-dessous du numéro de la dernière famille du village inscrit sur le tableau suffira pour indiquer la séparation. Mais si le village a un nom distinct ce nom doit être inscrit le long de la marge de gauche du tableau, entre la première et la dernière ligne de chaque feuille, jusqu'à ce que le recensement du village ait été complété. ... Cette séparation facilitera la compilation des statistiques agricoles et sera utile au point de vue historique pour retracer l'origine et le développement des villes de l'avenir. Toutefois, le recensement des villages qui ne sont pas constitués en municipalités sera inclus, comme il l'a été jusqu'ici, dans la statistique des districts ruraux.
23. Tout fonctionnaire ou toute personne employée au recensement est tenu au secret absolu sur les renseignements recueillis par les recenseurs et inscrits sur les tableaux ou feuilles. Il est défendu au recenseur de montrer ses tableaux à qui que ce soit, ou d'en faire ou d'en garder une copie, ou de répondre à des questions sur leur contenu, soit directement soit indirectement; la même obligation du secret est imposée aux commissaires et autres fonctionnaires ou employés du service extérieur, de même qu'à tout fonctionnaire, commis ou autre employé du bureau du recensement à Ottawa. Les faits et statistiques du recensement ne doivent servir qu'aux compilations statistiques, et on devra donner l'assurance positive de ce fait à toute personne qui craint que ces renseignements ne puissent servir de guide pour l'imposition de taxes ou pour toute autre fin.
36. Le recenseur est tenu de faire toutes les entrées dans les tableaux avec une encre de bonne qualité, et chaque nom, mot, chiffre ou marque devra être clair et lisible. Si le tableau n'est pas lisible, ou si les entrées sont faites avec de la mauvaise encre, ou au crayon de plomb, ou si elles sont brouillées ou effacées, le travail du recenseur peut avoir été fait en pure perte. Le but du recensement est d'obtenir des statistiques permanentes, et les tableaux seront conservés aux Archives du Canada ...
Loi sur les Archives nationales du Canada, S.R.C. 1985, c. 1
4. (1) Les Archives nationales du Canada conservent les documents privés et publics d'importance nationale et en favorisent l'accès. Elles sont le dépositaire permanent des documents des institutions fédérales et des documents ministériels. Elles facilitent la gestion des documents des institutions fédérales et des documents ministériels et appuient les milieux des archives.
