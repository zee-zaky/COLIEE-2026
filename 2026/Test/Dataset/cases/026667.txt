Rouleau, J.
: The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated May 31, 1993, wherein it was determined that he was not a Convention refugee.
[2]
The applicant, a thirty-six year old citizen of the former Soviet Union, fears persecution in both Russia and Estonia based on his religion, nationality and membership in a particular social group; specifically because of his Russian ethnicity and his Jewish faith. The record indicates that he lived and studied in Russia for twenty-seven years and then he moved to Estonia where he lived and worked for seven years before fleeing to Canada in January 1992. He testified that because of anti-Semitism in Russia it was very difficult for Jews to find suitable employment so he moved to Estonia and began working there.
[3]
Unfortunately, he also encountered difficulties there; Estonians traditionally despise anyone with Russian heritage and between October 1985 and November 1987 he was accosted on two occasions by individuals who told him that they hated Russians. After Estonia declared its independence on August 20, 1991, anti-semitic organizations began to appear in Estonia and the applicant found life even more difficult. He testified that on December 1, 1991, he was confronted by a group of men who told him to get out of Estonia and began beating him with a police stick. Afterwards, he received threatening notes, seven in all, which were signed by the Kaysilit, a militarized nationalistic movement; he was afraid that they would carry through with their threats. On January 25, 1992, he left Moscow, particularly to vacation in Columbia. When the flight landed at Gander for refuelling, he indicated to Canadian officials his intention to claim Convention refugee status.
[4]
The applicant appeared before the Board on April 19, 1993. At the outset, they determined that because he had not applied for citizenship in either Russia or Estonia, he was a "stateless" person and that because there was no legal impediment to his returning to either country, they both qualified as "countries of former habitual residence". As the applicant's counsel took the view that Estonia was his "country of former habitual residence", the Board proceeded to first examine the applicant's fears vis-à-vis that nation.
[5]
After reviewing the documentary evidence, the Board concluded that the applicant's fear was not well-founded. At pp. 5-6 of their reasons they state:
"Based on the totality of the evidence before us, and in particular the foregoing [
their review of the documentary evidence
], the panel does not find there to be a reasonable chance that the claimant would be persecuted were he to be returned to Estonia.
As a Russian Jew, he may very well face discrimination, but in our opinion it does not amount to persecution
. In so doing, we are preferring the documentary evidence to that of the claimant. The documentary evidence comes from a variety of reputable sources, none of whom have a vested interest in whether or not the claimant is determined to be a Convention refugee. To that extent, they are unbiased. The same cannot be said for the claimant." 	(emphasis added)
[6]
Although this finding was determinative of the issue of his refugee status, the Board went even further and stated:
"Even if that finding were to have been otherwise, we would still be unable to find what the claimant fears to be persecution within the meaning of the definition. The element of state complicity is absent."
[7]
As the Board had already concluded that the applicant could return to Estonia, then proceeded to assess his claim upon his unwillingness to do so and, relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 81, they concluded that because the applicant identified his agents of persecution as being nationalistic groups, the element of state complicity required when one was "unwilling" as opposed to "unable" to return to one's country, was absent and therefore what he fears is not persecution as defined by the
Act
.
[8]
The Board then discussed the ability of the State to provide protection, because this issue had been raised at the hearing. The Board questioned the relevancy of this issue; nevertheless, they did address it and concluded:
"In any event, it has already been noted that Estonia condemns acts of anti-Semitism and takes action against them. That they may not have been completely successful in eradicating anti-Semitism (and what government has?) cannot qualify the claimant as a Convention refugee."
As they had already determined that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution vis-à-vis Estonia, they did not feel that it was necessary to examine his claim as against Russia.
[9]
Several grounds were advanced in support of this application. Counsel submitted that the Board erred when it determined that as a Russian Jew, the applicant faced discrimination in Estonia, but that this did not amount to persecution. I was referred to paragraph 65 of the
U.N.H.C.R. Handbook
which reads:
"65. Persecution is normally related to action by the authorities of a country. It may also emanate from sections of the population that do not respect the standards established by the laws of the country concerned. A case in point may be religious intolerance, amounting to persecution, in a country otherwise secular, but where sizeable fractions of the population do not respect the religious beliefs of their neighbours. Where serious discriminatory or other offensive acts are committed by the local populace, they can be considered as persecution if they are knowingly tolerated by the authorities, or if the authorities refuse or prove unable, to offer effective protection."
[10]
Another argument advanced was that the Board erred when it determined that the applicant could not satisfy the definition of a Convention refugee in the absence of state complicity; that according to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 1; 20 Imm. L.R.(2d) 85, the fear, if well-founded, does not require state complicity in the persecution in question.
[11]
Counsel also suggested that the Board erred in its analysis of the state's ability to protect the applicant; that the Board even questioned the relevance of this issue. Again relying on
Ward
, supra, it was submitted that the applicant demonstrated that the state was unable to protect him and that he was at risk of persecution at the hands of various nationalistic groups.
[12]
Finally, it was submitted that the Board erred in law when it stated that they preferred the documentary evidence to that of the claimant; that nowhere in their reasons do they doubt the applicant's credibility and accordingly his testimony alone could have supported a positive finding of refugee status; that if they did have some concerns with his evidence, they were obliged to give clear and unmistakable reasons for casting doubt on his testimony which they have not done:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 199.
[13]
It should be pointed out that the Board determined that the applicant's fears were not well-founded; that what he fears is discrimination and that this was not serious enough to amount to persecution. I am satisfied that the Board's finding in this regard is not sufficiently unreasonable to warrant interference by this court. Admittedly the Board did question the relevance of the issue of the state's ability to protect the applicant, and of course, following
Ward
, the issue of state protection is relevant; if the state is able to offer protection, then the claimant's fears, objectively speaking, are not well-founded; conversely where there is evidence of the state's inability to protect, one can presume that the fears are well-founded. On a reading of the reasons in their entirety, it is apparent that the Board carefully reviewed the documentary evidence, noting that Estonia condemns acts of anti-Semitism and takes action against those who perpetrate these acts and that while they may not have been completely successful in eradicating anti-Semitism, they are nevertheless willing to offer protection. Again I am satisfied that this finding was reasonable based on the record and it further supports the conclusion that the applicant's fears are not well-founded.
[14]
Given that the Board had already determined that the applicant's fears were not well-founded, the question of whether he was "willing" or "unable" to return to Estonia need not have been addressed, as stated in the headnotes of
Ward
, supra, at p. 691:
"The inquiry as to whether a claimant meets the "Convention refugee" definition must focus on whether there is a "well-founded fear", which the claimant must first establish, and all that follows must be 'by reason of' that fear."
While I accept that the Board did err in law in concluding that state complicity was necessary in order to satisfy the requirement of being "unwilling" or "unable" to return; this error had no bearing on their finding that his fears were not objectively well-founded and the conclusion that he was not a Convention refugee.
[15]
Finally, I am not persuaded that the Board erred by preferring the documentary evidence to that of the applicant. The Board members are "masters in their own house" and it is open to them to decide what weight to give the evidence; in the present case they accepted the applicant's testimony but chose to place more weight on the documentary evidence.
[16]
At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel for the applicant submitted the following question for certification:
"Did the panel err in preferring the documentary evidence over the claimant's oral testimony when it determined that the claimant's testimony was biased?"
[17]
I have not been satisfied that this question raises a serious issue nor an issue of general importance so as to warrant certification. Accordingly, this application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
