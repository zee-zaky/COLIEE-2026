[1]
de Montigny, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD or the "Tribunal"), in which the member rejected the Applicant's claim for protection, finding that she was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA].
1. Facts
[2]
The Applicant is a 35 year old citizen of Turkey, of Alevi faith and Kurdish ethnicity. She entered Canada from the United States on November 1, 2009 and claimed refugee protection based on her nationality and religion.
[3]
The Applicant claims that she and her family have suffered a long history of harassment from the authorities and their fellow citizens due to her religion and ethnicity as an Alevi Kurd. Born and raised in Karakocan, in the eastern part of Turkey, she was not allowed by the authorities to speak Kurdish, celebrate Kurdish holidays or practice her religion. Through her primary schooling, she was taught Turkish and a religion other than her own, and subjected to insults and assaults from the teachers and students.
[4]
In 1988, the Applicant's brother was arrested, detained, beaten and tortured for possessing a Kurdish book. He left Turkey in 1989 and was granted refugee status in Germany, where he continues to reside. In 1995, he was accused by Turkish authorities of being a member of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) even though he had not been in the country since 1989; the case was finally dismissed in 2004 for lack of evidence.
[5]
In 1999, one of her sisters and that sister's husband were harassed by the police, arrested and their house searched. This was as a result of having worked for and, in the case of the husband, having run as a candidate for, the People's Democracy Party (HADEP), a pro-Kurdish political party. They also fled to Germany, where they were granted asylum.
[6]
After the Applicant's brother left Turkey, the authorities constantly harassed the family with regular threats and house raids, and her father was interrogated and beaten several times while in custody. In 1994, the family moved across the country to Izmir, in the western part of Turkey.
[7]
The Applicant attended university in the city of Antakya in 1996, where she faced many problems:
- In 1996, a Kurdish spring celebration at the school was dispersed by the police and the Applicant was hit by batons and kicked;
- In 2001, the Applicant was threatened for not taking part in Ramadan (not part of the Alevi faith); and
- In 2002, during a protest by Kurd students, the Applicant was beaten badly by police, and then attacked again after issuing a press release about the attack.
[8]
When the Applicant graduated, she became a teacher with the Ministry of Education in the city of Diyarbakir. In 2005, the Applicant called in sick to work in order to attend the Kurdish Newroz celebrations. Despite the school director phoning to warn her that the Ministry was checking all schools to determine who was absent and celebrating the holiday, she did not return to work. On that night, the police arrested the Applicant at her house, detained her for 12 hours, interrogated, threatened and beat her. After that incident she was frequently pulled aside for questioning at road blocks.
[9]
On March 8, 2007, the Applicant was involved in setting up a conference for International Women's Day, which was conducted in the Kurdish language. The police raided the conference and arrested the organizers and the Applicant. The Applicant was detained for 24 hours, questioned and treated badly.
[10]
After the conference incident, the Ministry of Education forced her to move and teach in the city of Antakya, which she likened to banishment. She was isolated as an Alevi Kurd in this city, where the administration of the new school frequently threatened to fire her, her colleagues avoided her and the students vandalized her property and did not respect her.
[11]
The Applicant applied for a Canadian visa but was denied, and subsequently obtained a US visitor visa as a short-term student after having been granted permission from her employers to attend. She completed an English language course in Florida and then came to Canada by means of a people smuggler. She arrived in Montreal on November 1, 2009 and requested refugee protection the following day.
2. The impugned decision
[12]
The Tribunal issued a very brief decision on August 23, 2011, which was communicated to the Applicant on September 1, 2011, finding that the Applicant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
[13]
The Tribunal was satisfied as to the Applicant's identity and concluded that the Applicant was credible. The determinative issue for the Tribunal was that the Applicant had not demonstrated that her treatment at the hands of the police in Turkey reached the level of severity consistent with persecution. In the alternative, the Tribunal noted that the Applicant would have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in the city of Izmir.
[14]
The Tribunal determined that the pattern of events did not meet the criteria of persecution, and noted that:
- The Applicant was a teacher with a secure post, had the means to pay for her trip to the US and was able to get permission for the trip from the authorities;
- The Applicant agreed not to attend Newroz celebrations after the incident of 2005, and the police did not bother her again;
- The Applicant claimed that the conference was illegal because Kurdish was spoken by the panellists, but if they had dispersed or stopped speaking that language there would have been no problem. Moreover, the laws regarding the Kurdish language have since changed; and
- The isolation and vandalism faced by the Applicant in Antakya did not meet the severity of persecution.
[15]
The Tribunal then concluded that as a young and educated woman with advanced language skills, the Applicant could quit her job with the education ministry and find employment in a range of other worthy professions in Izmir. The Tribunal also noted that the Applicant's parents live in Izmir, which is the city where she wanted to be posted as a teacher following her graduation, and that the Applicant herself testified that she would be safe living there. As a result, the Tribunal concluded that Izmir would be a viable IFA.
3. Issues
[16]
This application for judicial review raises two issues:
a) Did the Tribunal err in determining that the Applicant's treatment did not constitute persecution?
b) Did the Tribunal err in determining that the Applicant has a viable IFA available to her in Izmir?
4. Analysis
a) Did the Tribunal err in determining that the Applicant's treatment did not constitute persecution?
[17]
The determination as to whether the treatment received by the Applicant amounts to persecution has been determined by the case law to be a question of mixed fact and law: see, for ex.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) at para 15 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ no 619;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ no 561 [
Gebre-Hiwet
] ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2005] FCJ no 559. That being said, the failure of a tribunal to consider the cumulative effects of discrimination is a question of law and would attract a standard of correctness on review: see
Gebre-Hiwet
at para 13
,
above;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[18]
Despite the fact that the absence of persecution was perceived by the Tribunal as the determinative issue in this case, the Respondent took no position with respect to this finding. The Applicant, predictably, argued vigorously that the cumulative effect of the numerous instances of discrimination and harassment that she experienced amounted to persecution.
[19]
The Tribunal did not address this issue at length and merely offered three rationales for its conclusion that the Applicant had not met her burden of showing that the severity of the discrimination and her treatment at the hands of the police, reached the level of severity which is consistent with persecution:
- The Applicant had a good job as a teacher and was permitted to leave the country for training in the US;
- The Applicant admitted that if she stopped attending Kurdish celebrations and stopped speaking the Kurdish language and dispersed the conference, she would not have had problems with the police; and
- The isolation and vandalism she faced when moved to Antakya are not severe enough to constitute persecution.
[20]
These reasons fall far short of a compelling demonstration that the Applicant would not suffer persecution if she were to return to Turkey. The Tribunal, in particular, failed to analyze the cumulative effects of the discriminatory treatment experienced by the Applicant to determine if, viewed as a whole, it amounted to persecution. As Justice Dawson stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 205:
[I]n cases where the evidence establishes a series of actions characterized to be discriminatory there is a requirement to consider the cumulative nature of that conduct. This requirement reflects the fact that prior incidents are capable of forming the foundation for present fear.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A). This is also expressed in the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status in the following terms, at paragraph 53:
In addition, an applicant may have been subjected to various measures not in themselves amounting to persecution (e.g. discrimination in different forms), in some cases combined with other adverse factors (e.g. general atmosphere of insecurity in the country of origin). In such situations, the various elements involved may, if taken together, produce an effect on the mind of the applicant that can reasonably justify a claim to a well-founded fear of persecution on "cumulative grounds".
[21]
In the case at bar, the Tribunal fails to perform that task. The Tribunal did say that the isolation and vandalism the Applicant had to go through when reassigned to Antakya in retaliation for her participation in the organization of the International Women's Day did not amount to persecution. It did not, however, even attempt to explain why and on what basis it came to that conclusion. As for the fact that she had a secure post and was given permission to travel to the United States, it is largely irrelevant to the analysis required.
[22]
The second ground given by the Tribunal to explain its finding that the Applicant would not experience any problem, reflects a profound misunderstanding of the refugee protection system. First of all, the Applicant is of Kurdish nationality and Alevi faith; these are intrinsic characteristics that the Applicant cannot shun as they define in large part who she is. More importantly, the Applicant cannot be asked to renounce her faith and language in order to live peacefully. It is undoubtedly true that persecution could often be avoided if groups asserting their ethnicity and religion simply stopped doing so and quietly dispersed when asked by the state. However, it is precisely to avoid this result that state parties have agreed to the
United Nations
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
, July 28, 1951, [1969] Can TS No 6. An applicant cannot be asked to renounce his or her deeply held beliefs or to stop exercising his or her fundamental rights in order to avoid persecution and as a price to pay to live in security. This is apparently the choice that some of the Applicant's siblings still living in Turkey have made; the Applicant, however, should not be coerced into making the same decision, even assuming that such a course of action would entitle her to live without fear of persecution.
[23]
For the above reasons, I am of the view that the decision of the Tribunal is deeply flawed and must be quashed. Not only was the Tribunal's finding that the Applicant had not demonstrated persecution critical to its overall determination, but, as conceded by the Respondent, the Tribunal could very well have come to a different conclusion with respect to the IFA had it focused on the proper criteria to establish persecution. Indeed, a careful reading of the Tribunal Record and of the transcript reveals that the Tribunal misapprehended the testimony and evidence of the Applicant.
b) Did the Tribunal err in determining that the Applicant has a viable IFA available to her in Izmir?
[24]
The Tribunal relied heavily on the fact that the Applicant's parents continue to live in Izmir and on its assertion that the Applicant herself testified that "she would be safe living there": Decision of the Tribunal, para 14. Yet, nothing is further from the truth. The Applicant stated in her testimony that her family was constantly harassed by the authorities and her father interrogated by the police on numerous occasions, even after he decided to move his family to Izmir. The Applicant also said that she did not have any problem while she was attending university in Izmir, because she was always studying. It should be noted, however, that was before she started asserting her Kurdish identity and acting upon it. She specifically claimed that she is now targeted because of her Kurdish ethnicity and Alevi faith, and that she would be at risk everywhere in Turkey (see transcript, pp. 173-74 and 197 of the Tribunal Record).
[25]
The Tribunal therefore misapprehended her testimony. Far from saying that she would be safe in Izmir, she stated the exact opposite. In view of the fact that the Tribunal found her credible, this is an especially critical error. Even though the Tribunal is entitled to a high degree of deference on matters pertaining to IFA, I am of the view that the Tribunal's finding is unacceptable in light of the evidence that was before it. Accordingly, this is an additional reason to quash its decision.
[26]
This application for judicial review is therefore granted, and the matter is remitted to a different panel of the Refugee Protection Division for re-determination. No question is certified.

THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is granted. No question is certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire visant une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR ou le tribunal) par laquelle le membre a rejeté la demande d'asile de la demanderesse après avoir conclu que cette dernière n'avait pas qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger aux termes des articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR].
1. Faits
[2]
La demanderesse, citoyenne de la Turquie âgée de 35 ans, est de confession alévie et d'origine ethnique kurde. Elle est arrivée au Canada depuis les États-Unis le 1er novembre 2009 et elle a demandé l'asile sur le fondement de sa nationalité et de sa religion.
[3]
La demanderesse avance qu'elle et les membres de sa famille subissent depuis longtemps le harcèlement des autorités et de leurs concitoyens à cause de leur religion et de leur origine ethnique à titre de Kurdes alévis. La demanderesse est née et a été élevée à Karakocan, dans la partie est de la Turquie, et les autorités lui interdisaient de parler le kurde, de célébrer les fêtes kurdes et de pratiquer sa religion. Pendant ses études primaires, on lui a enseigné la langue turque et une religion autre que la sienne, et elle a été victime d'insultes et d'agressions de la part des enseignants et des élèves.
[4]
En 1988, le frère de la demanderesse a été arrêté, détenu, battu et torturé pour avoir eu un livre turc en sa possession. Il a quitté la Turquie en 1989 et il a obtenu le statut de réfugié en Allemagne, où il réside toujours. En 1995, les autorités turques l'ont accusé d'être membre du Parti des Travailleurs du Kurdistan (le PTK), même s'il n'était pas retourné en Turquie depuis 1989. L'affaire a finalement été rejetée en 2004 pour manque de preuve.
[5]
En 1999, l'une de ses sœurs et le mari de celle-ci ont été harcelés et arrêtés par la police et leur maison a été perquisitionnée parce qu'ils avaient travaillé pour le Parti de la Démocratie du Peuple (HADEP), parti politique pro-kurde, et, dans le cas du mari, parce qu'il s'était présenté comme candidat de ce parti. Ils se sont également enfuis en Allemagne, où ils ont obtenu asile.
[6]
Après le départ de la Turquie du frère de la demanderesse, les autorités n'ont cessé de harceler la famille au moyen de menaces et de descentes à domicile périodiques, et le père de la demanderesse a été interrogé et battu à plusieurs occasions alors qu'il était détenu. En 1994, la famille a déménagé à Izmir, à l'autre bout du pays, dans la partie ouest de la Turquie.
[7]
En 1996, la demanderesse a étudié à l'université dans la ville d'Antakya, où elle a fait face à de nombreuses difficultés:
- En 1996, une célébration du printemps kurde a eu lieu à l'établissement d'enseignement; la police a dispersé les personnes présentes et la demanderesse a reçu des coups de matraque ainsi que des coups de pieds;
- En 2001, la demanderesse a reçu des menaces pour n'avoir pas participé au ramadan (lequel ne fait pas partie de la religion alévie);
- En 2002, au cours d'un mouvement de protestation d'étudiants kurdes, la demanderesse a été gravement battue par la police, puis attaquée à nouveau après avoir publié un communiqué de presse au sujet de l'attaque.
[8]
Lorsque la demanderesse a obtenu son diplôme, elle est devenue enseignante auprès du ministère de l'éducation, dans la ville de Diyarbakir. En 2005, elle s'est fait porter malade afin de participer aux célébrations kurdes de la Newroz. Malgré un appel du directeur l'avertissant que le ministère vérifiait toutes les écoles pour déterminer qui était absent pour célébrer cette fête, elle n'est pas retournée au travail. Ce soir-là, la police a arrêté la demanderesse dans sa maison, l'a détenue pendant douze heures, l'a interrogée, l'a menacée et l'a battue. Après cet incident, elle a fréquemment été mise à l'écart à des barrages routiers et interrogée.
[9]
Le 8 mars 2007, la demanderesse a participé à l'organisation d'une conférence qui a été présentée en langue kurde dans le cadre de la Journée internationale de la femme. La police a fait une descente pendant la conférence et a arrêté les organisateurs et la demanderesse. Cette dernière a été détenue pendant 24 heures, interrogée et maltraitée.
[10]
Après cet incident, le ministère de l'éducation l'a obligée à déménager et à enseigner dans la ville d'Antakya, ce qu'elle a comparé à un exil. À titre de Kurde alévie, elle était isolée dans cette ville où les responsables de l'administration de la nouvelle école la menaçaient souvent de congédiement, où ses collègues l'évitaient et où les étudiants saccageaient ses biens et lui manquaient de respect.
[11]
La demanderesse a présenté, sans succès, une demande de visa canadien et elle a subséquemment obtenu un visa de visiteur aux États-Unis comme étudiante à court terme après que ses employeurs lui eurent accordé l'autorisation d'y étudier. Elle a terminé un cours de langue anglaise en Floride et elle est ensuite entrée au Canada avec l'aide d'un passeur de clandestins. Elle est arrivée à Montréal le 1er novembre 2009 et elle a demandé l'asile le lendemain.
2. Décision attaquée
[12]
Le 23 août 2011, le tribunal a rendu une très courte décision, communiquée à la demanderesse le 1er septembre 2011, par laquelle il a conclu que cette dernière n'avait pas qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger.
[13]
Le tribunal était convaincu de l'identité et de la crédibilité de la demanderesse. Selon lui, l'élément essentiel en l'espèce tenait au fait que la demanderesse n'avait pas établi que la façon dont la police l'avait traitée en Turquie était suffisamment violente pour constituer de la persécution. À titre subsidiaire, le tribunal a signalé que la demanderesse pourrait se prévaloir d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) viable dans la ville d'Izmir.
[14]
Le tribunal a estimé que le genre d'événements en cause ne satisfaisait pas aux critères applicables en matière de persécution, et il a tenu les propos suivants:
- La demanderesse était une enseignante bénéficiant d'un poste stable, elle avait les moyens de payer pour son voyage aux États-Unis et elle a réussi à obtenir des autorités la permission nécessaire;
- La demanderesse s'est engagée à ne plus participer aux célébrations de la Newroz après l'incident de 2005, et la police a ensuite cessé de l'ennuyer;
- La demanderesse a allégué que la conférence était illégale parce que les conférenciers parlaient le kurde mais, s'ils s'étaient dispersés ou s'ils avaient cessé de parler cette langue, il n'y aurait plus eu de problème. En outre, les lois régissant la langue kurde ont été modifiées depuis;
- La mise en isolement et le vandalisme subis par la demanderesse à Antakya n'étaient pas suffisamment graves pour être assimilés à de la persécution.
[15]
Le tribunal a ensuite conclu qu'à titre de jeune femme instruite spécialisée dans le domaine des langues, la demanderesse pouvait démissionner de son poste auprès du ministère de l'éducation et se trouver un emploi dans un éventail d'autres professions intéressantes à Izmir. Il a en outre signalé que les parents de la demanderesse vivent à Izmir, ville où cette dernière souhaitait travailler comme enseignante après avoir obtenu son diplôme, et que la demanderesse elle-même avait témoigné qu'elle vivrait en sécurité à cet endroit. Le tribunal est donc arrivé à la conclusion qu'Izmir constituerait une PRI viable.
3. Questions en litige
[16]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève deux questions:
a) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur lorsqu'il a décidé que le traitement réservé à la demanderesse ne constituait pas de la persécution?
b) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur lorsqu'il a décidé que la demanderesse pouvait se prévaloir d'une PRI viable à Izmir?
4. Analyse
a) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur lorsqu'il a décidé que le traitement réservé à la demanderesse ne constituait pas de la persécution?
[17]
Il est établi par la jurisprudence que la question de savoir si le traitement réservé à la demanderesse équivaut à de la persécution est une question mixte de fait et de droit: voir, par exemple,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 15 (1re inst.);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] ACF no 619;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] ACF no 561 [
Gebre-Hiwet
] ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2005] ACF no 559. Cela étant dit, l'omission, par le tribunal, de tenir compte des effets cumulatifs de la discrimination est une question de droit, laquelle est assujettie à la norme de contrôle fondée sur la décision correcte: voir
Gebre-Hiwet
, au paragraphe 13
,
plus haut;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[18]
Bien que, selon le tribunal, l'absence de persécution ait joué un rôle fondamental en l'espèce, le défendeur n'a avancé aucun argument touchant cette conclusion. D'une manière prévisible, la demanderesse a allégué avec insistance que l'effet cumulatif des nombreux cas de discrimination et de harcèlement qu'elle a vécus équivalait à de la persécution.
[19]
Le tribunal n'a pas examiné cette question de façon approfondie et il s'est contenté d'offrir trois motifs pour justifier sa conclusion voulant que la demanderesse n'ait pas réussi à s'acquitter de son obligation de prouver que la gravité de la discrimination et du traitement dont elle était l'objet aux mains de la police était suffisante pour s'apparenter à de la persécution:
- La demanderesse occupait un bon emploi à titre d'enseignante et elle avait été autorisée à quitter le pays pour suivre une formation aux États-Unis;
- La demanderesse a admis que, si elle avait cessé de participer aux célébrations kurdes et de parler la langue kurde et si elle avait demandé aux personnes présentes à la conférence de se disperser, elle n'aurait pas eu de problème avec la police;
- La mise en isolement et le vandalisme qu'elle a subis lorsqu'elle est déménagée à Antakya ne sont pas suffisamment graves pour équivaloir à de la persécution.
[20]
Ces raisons sont loin de constituer une preuve convaincante du fait que la demanderesse ne serait pas victime de persécution si elle retournait en Turquie. Le tribunal, en particulier, a omis d'analyser les effets cumulatifs du traitement discriminatoire réservé à la demanderesse pour décider si, dans l'ensemble, il s'agissait d'une persécution. Comme l'a mentionné la juge Dawson dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 205:
[D]ans les cas où la preuve établit une série d'actions considérées comme discriminatoires, il faut tenir compte de la nature cumulée des actes en cause. Cette exigence indique que des événements antérieurs peuvent servir de fondement à la crainte actuelle.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.). C'est ce qui est également dit dans le Guide des procédures et critères à appliquer pour déterminer le statut de réfugié du HCNUR, paragraphe 53:
En outre, un demandeur du statut de réfugié peut avoir fait l'objet de mesures diverses qui en elles-mêmes ne sont pas des persécutions (par exemple, différentes mesures de discrimination), auxquelles viennent s'ajouter dans certains cas d'autres circonstances adverses (par exemple une atmosphère générale d'insécurité dans le pays d'origine). En pareil cas, les divers éléments de la situation, pris conjointement, peuvent provoquer chez le demandeur un état d'esprit qui permet raisonnablement de dire qu'il craint d'être persécuté pour des « motifs cumulés ».
[21]
Dans la présente affaire, le tribunal n'a pas accompli cette tâche. Il a affirmé que la mise en isolement et le vandalisme qu'a dû subir la demanderesse lorsqu'elle a été réaffectée à Antakya en représailles pour sa participation à l'organisation de la Journée internationale de la femme n'équivalaient pas à de la persécution. Cependant, il n'a même pas tenté de préciser pourquoi et sur quel fondement il en était arrivé à cette conclusion. En ce qui concerne le fait qu'elle occupait un poste stable et qu'elle avait obtenu la permission de voyager aux États-Unis, cela est en grande partie dénué de pertinence au regard de l'analyse applicable.
[22]
Le deuxième motif donné par le tribunal pour étayer sa conclusion selon laquelle la demanderesse n'éprouverait aucune difficulté dénote une profonde incompréhension du régime de protection des réfugiés. Premièrement, la demanderesse est de nationalité kurde et de confession alévie; il s'agit de caractéristiques intrinsèques auxquelles elle ne peut se dérober puisqu'elles définissent en grande partie qui elle est. Plus important encore, on ne peut lui demander de renoncer à sa foi et à sa langue pour vivre une vie paisible. Il est sans aucun doute exact que, si les groupes qui affirment leur origine ethnique et leur religion cessaient simplement de le faire et se dispersaient calmement lorsque l'État le leur demande, ils pourraient souvent éviter la persécution. Or, c'est justement pour empêcher ce genre de situation que les États parties ont conclu la
Convention relative au statut des réfugiés
des Nations Unies, 28 juillet 1951, R.T. Can. 1969 no 6. On ne peut demander à un demandeur de renoncer à ses croyances profondes ou de cesser d'exercer ses droits fondamentaux comme prix à payer pour vivre en sécurité et éviter la persécution. Il semble que ce soit le choix fait par certains membres de la fratrie de la demanderesse vivant toujours en Turquie; la demanderesse ne devrait toutefois pas être forcée à prendre une telle décision, même si on suppose que cette ligne de conduite pourrait lui permettre de vivre sans crainte de persécution.
[23]
Pour les raisons qui précèdent, j'estime que la décision du tribunal est profondément viciée et doit être annulée. Non seulement la conclusion du tribunal voulant que la demanderesse n'ait pas établi l'existence d'une persécution a-t-elle influé d'une manière fondamentale sur sa décision dans son ensemble mais, comme l'a admis le défendeur, le tribunal aurait très bien pu tirer une conclusion différente quant à la PRI s'il avait appliqué les critères appropriés en ce qui concerne la preuve de la persécution. En réalité, il ressort d'une lecture attentive du dossier du tribunal et de la transcription que le tribunal a mal interprété le témoignage et la preuve présentés par la demanderesse.
b) Le tribunal a-t-il commis une erreur lorsqu'il a décidé que la demanderesse pouvait se prévaloir d'une PRI viable à Izmir?
[24]
Le tribunal s'est grandement appuyé sur le fait que les parents de la demanderesse continuent de vivre à Izmir et que, selon lui, la demanderesse elle-même a témoigné qu'elle [traduction] « vivrait en sécurité à cet endroit »: décision du tribunal, paragraphe 14. Or, rien n'est moins sûr. La demanderesse a déclaré dans son témoignage que sa famille était constamment harcelée par les autorités et que son père avait été interrogé par la police à de nombreuses occasions, même après qu'il eut décidé de déménager sa famille à Izmir. La demanderesse a en outre mentionné qu'elle n'avait pas eu de difficulté pendant qu'elle fréquentait l'université à Izmir parce qu'elle passait tout son temps à étudier. Il importe toutefois de signaler que cela remonte à une période où elle n'avait pas encore commencé à affirmer son identité kurde et à agir en conséquence. Elle a explicitement affirmé qu'elle est maintenant une cible à cause de son origine ethnique kurde et de sa confession alévie, et qu'elle court un risque partout en Turquie (voir la transcription, pages 173, 174 et 197 du dossier du tribunal).
[25]
Le tribunal a donc mal compris le témoignage de la demanderesse. Loin de dire qu'elle serait en sécurité à Izmir, elle a affirmé tout le contraire. À la lumière du fait que le tribunal a conclu que la demanderesse était digne de foi, il s'agit d'une erreur particulièrement grave. Même s'il convient de faire preuve d'une grande retenue envers l'opinion du tribunal touchant les questions liées à une PRI, j'estime que la conclusion du tribunal est inacceptable, compte tenu de la preuve dont il était saisi. Cette raison milite elle aussi en faveur de l'annulation de sa décision.
[26]
Par conséquent, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, et l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal différemment constitué de la Section de la protection des réfugiés pour qu'une nouvelle décision soit rendue. Aucune question n'est certifiée.
