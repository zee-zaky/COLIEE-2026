Reed, J.
: This is an application by Pfizer Canada Inc. seeking access to all material filed in these proceedings. On February 24, 1986 an order of this Court issued sealing the existing record in order to maintain the confidentiality of the material then on file and to extend such protection to material subsequently filed. This order was given with the consent of the parties (the plaintiff Apotex Inc. and the defendants the Attorney General of Canada and the Minister of National Health and Welfare). Pfizer Canada Inc. had notice that such an order would be sought; the extent to which its consent was sought or obtained is not recorded on the file.
[2]
At the time of the sealing order, Pfizer had filed a motion (dated February 20, 1986) to be added as a party intervener to the proceedings. That motion was heard by Mr. Justice Walsh on March 3, 1986 and it was dismissed by order dated March 6, 1986 [see 1 F.T.R. 310]. An appeal of that order was filed and Pfizer sought at the same time a stay of the main proceedings in this action until disposition of the appeal. That application to stay was heard by Mr. Justice Martin on March 10, 1986, and dismissed by him on March 11, 1986, that is immediately before the main proceedings commenced [see 5 F.T.R. 241]. Pfizer has appealed the order refusing to stay the proceeding.
[3]
The original order sealing the file was granted to apply "until further order of this Court". The applicant Pfizer seeks access to the sealed record in order to properly pursue its appeal of the orders of March 6, and March 11 as well as on a broader ground as any member of the public might seek access to Court records. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendants object to Pfizer having access to the record up to the time that its application for a stay of proceedings was heard, except for certain documents filed on the same day in the registry for use in the main proceedings and not used in the application to stay proceedings. Rule 1204 provides that:
"The appeal shall be upon a case that shall consist (unless, in any case, the parties otherwise agree or the court otherwise orders) of
(a) the judgment appealed from and any reasons given therefor;
(b) the pleadings;
(c) a transcript of any verbal testimony given during the hearing giving rise to the judgment appealed from;
(d) any affidavits, documentary exhibits or other documents filed during such hearing;
(e) any written or other admissions of the parties otherwise put before the court during such hearing; and
(f) any physical exhibits filed during such hearing."
[4]
It is difficult to find any reason why an adequate opportunity to fully pursue the applicant's appeals requires access to more than what the parties are quite willing to accord. Pfizer Canada has not presented any good argument as to why a broader access is necessary.
[5]
Pfizer seeks access not only as an appellant of the two above-noted orders but also as "any person" under Rule 201 (4) which provides that:
"(4) Any person may, subject to appropriate supervision, and when the facilities of the court permit without interfering with the ordinary work of the court,
(a) inspect any court file or the annex thereto; and
(b) upon payment of $0.20 per page, obtain a photocopy of any document on a court file or the annex thereto."
[6]
It is argued that as a matter of general principle I should grant access to the sealed file.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.L.), especially a page 431;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. (2d) 185 (F.C.A.); and Smith Kline and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), are cited. It is argued that it is a matter of fundamental public order that proceedings be public and that while there are some exceptions they do not pertain in this case.
[7]
I do not consider this argument to be a sufficient ground for altering the original order sealing the court file. When that order was made the general principle would have been considered. The Associate Chief Justice found it appropriate on the basis of the representations made to him by the parties at that time to provide an exception to that general principle and to seal the file. I do not think the phrase in the Associate Chief Justice's order "until further ordered by this court" comtemplates a reopening of the file on the ground now sought by Pfizer. Something more than an argument based on the general principle of the public nature of court proceedings must be given as a reason for altering the original order - some changed circumstances, or compelling reason not directly considered when the order was given.
[8]
Accordingly an order granting Pfizer access to all material filed with the court prior to the order refusing to stay proceedings given on March 11, 1986, except for certain documents filed on the previous day in the registry for use in the main proceedings heard March 11, has been given.
Application dismissed.
