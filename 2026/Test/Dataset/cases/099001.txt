Introduction
[1]
Gibson, J.
: These reasons relate to two appeals pursuant to s. 56 of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13 of decisions whereby Myer Herzig, Member, Trademarks Opposition Board (the "Registrar"), rejected oppositions by the appellant to applications No. 585,214 and No. 585,195 filed on behalf of the respondent for the trademarks "Firstbank Cash Management Account" and "Firstbank Cash Management Account Design", each based on proposed use in Canada in association with "banking services". On each application, the respondent had disclaimed the right to the exclusive use of the words "cash management account" apart from the trademark as a whole.
[2]
The two oppositions were disposed of by the Registrar in a single set of reasons. The two appeals before the court were heard together on the basis of identical materials and single arguments on behalf of the appellant and the respondent. Accordingly, these reasons apply with respect to both appeals.
[3]
Section 56 of the
Trade-marks Act
reads as follows:
"56(1) An appeal lies to the Federal Court from any decision of the Registrar under this Act within two months from the date on which notice of the decision was dispatched by the Registrar or within such further time as the court may allow, either before or after the expiration of the two months.
"(2) An appeal under subs. (1) shall be made by way of notice of appeal filed with the Registrar and in the Federal Court.
"(3) The appellant shall, within the time limited or allowed by subs. (1), send a copy of the notice by registered mail to the registered owner of any trademark that has been referred to by the Registrar in the decision complained of and to every other person who was entitled to notice of the decision.
"(4) The Federal Court may direct that public notice of the hearing of an appeal under subs. (1) and of the matters at issue therein be given in such manner as it deems proper.
"(5) On an appeal under subs. (1), evidence in addition to that adduced before the Registrar may be adduced and the Federal Court may exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar."
The Parties
[4]
The appellant, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. is a holding company that, through subsidiaries and affiliates, provides investment, financing, insurance and related services. Its principal subsidiary, Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner & Smith Incorporated, is one of the largest securities firms in the world. Through its predecessor in title, the appellant has used the trademarks "Cash Management Account", "Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account", "CMA" and "CMA & Design" in association with financial services in the United States since 1977 and in several other countries throughout the world for many years. Also through a predecessor in title, Merrill Lynch Canada, Inc., the appellant used the trademarks "Cash Management Account", "Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account", "CMA" and "CMA & Design" in association with financial services in Canada from at least as early as March 5, 1985 until the appellant withdrew from business in Canada in 1990. More specifically, the appellant used its trademarks here in question in Canada in association with financial services, namely a margin brokerage account linked with chequing and debit/credit card banking services, financial services involving the use of plastic debit/credit cards by the cardholders for loans to cardholders from their brokerage accounts, stock brokerage services, administration of money market fund services and providing loans against securities services [see footnote 1].
[5]
The respondent, Bank of Montreal was established in Canada in 1817 and is one of Canada's largest chartered banks. Since 1973, it has used the trademark "Firstbank" to identify its banking services. "Firstbank" is a registered trademark of the respondent. It uses the trademark alone and in combination with descriptive words or phrases to identify particular services. "Firstbank Cash Management Account" service was first offered in Canada by the respondent in October, 1987. It designates a business account available to medium sized commercial and farm enterprises for use as a depository for the collection of business receipts and the disbursement of funds via cheques. Customers have access to a pre-established line of credit and can monitor their accounts through an electronic linkage to their account by personal computer.
[6]
The grounds of opposition by the appellant against the registration of the respondents' marks were three in number: first, the appellant alleged that the trademarks applied for were not registrable by reason of s. 12(1)(d) of the
Trade-marks Act
(the "
Act
") in that they were confusing with the appellant's registered trademarks "Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account", "CMA" and "CMA & Design", each of which relates to "financial services, namely, a margin brokerage account linked with chequing and credit card banking services"; second, the respondent was not the person entitled to registration by reason of s. 16(3)(a) of the
Act
in view of the appellant's prior use of its registered trademarks in association with the services covered by the registrations and of its unregistered trademark "Cash Management Account" in association with "financial services, namely, a margin brokerage account linked with chequing and credit card banking services"; and third, the marks applied for were not distinctive of the respondent in view of the appellant's registrations and the appellant's use in Canada of the confusingly similar unregistered trademark [see footnote 2].
[7]
The grounds for appeal of the decision of the Registrar to disallow the appellant's oppositions were as follows: first, that the Registrar erred in imposing an onus on the appellant to establish distinctiveness of its trademark "Cash Management Account" in order to find confusion; second, that the Registrar erred in not finding the respondent's applied-for marks to be unregistrable because of confusion with the appellant's marks; third, that the Registrar erred in not finding the respondent to be unentitled to registration because of confusion with the appellant's registered and unregistered marks in use; and finally, that the Registrar erred in finding the respondent's applied-for marks were distinctive.
The Registrar's Decision
[8]
In his decision, the Registrar found that the "... essential issue ..." to be determined was whether or not there was a reasonable likelihood of confusion between the marks applied for and either or both of the appellant's registered mark "Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account" and the appellant's unregistered mark "Cash Management Account". He concluded that if the marks applied for by the respondent were not confusing with either of those marks, then they would not be confusing with the appellant's registered marks "CMA" and "CMA & Design". At the hearing of this appeal, neither counsel took issue with this conclusion.
[9]
The Registrar determined the material dates with respect to the oppositions to be, with respect to the first ground of opposition, the date of his decision, namely, December 29, 1993; with respect to the second ground, the date of application, namely, June 2, 1987, with respect to both trademarks; and the date of opposition, June 27, 1988, with respect to the third ground, that is, distinctiveness. Once again, neither counsel took serious issue with these determinations [see footnote 3].
[10]
The Registrar was critical of the evidence before him on behalf of the appellant. With respect to the spill-over effect of advertising in American periodicals, the United States being the principal base of the appellant's world wide operations, the Registrar stated:
"I have not given much weight to Mr. Critchlow's testimony which attempts to establish that the opponent's marks have acquired a reputation in Canada through spill over advertising via magazines originating in the United States. No attempt has been made to prove the extent of circulation in Canada nor is it clear from Mr. Critchlow's evidence that advertisements placed in U.S. magazines would necessarily be found in issues of the magazines which might circulate in Canada."
Further commenting on the evidence of Mr. Critchlow, which I find was central to the appellant's case before the Registrar, the Registrar stated:
"It is also apparent from Mr. Critchlow's transcript of cross-examination that he is not particularly knowledgeable about how the phrase 'cash management account' has been used in Canada by third parties as a trademark or otherwise. While I accept his evidence that the phrase 'cash management account' has become uniquely identified with the opponent in the United States, I do not consider that Mr. Critchlow is qualified to arrive at an informed conclusion with regards to the distinctiveness of the opponent's marks in Canada."
[11]
The Registrar rejected the appellant's first ground of opposition (unregistrability because of confusion) on the basis that the later relevant date for that ground was of no aid to the appellant. The surrounding circumstances that led to his rejection of the other grounds of opposition had not, he concluded, changed significantly by the later material date applicable with respect to the first ground.
[12]
With respect to the second ground (disentitlement based on prior use), the Registrar determined that the appellant's unregistered trademark "Cash Management Account" "... was not distinctive of the [appellant's] (or any other person's) financial services at the relevant date, June 2, 1987. Since the public would not associate the mark 'Cash Management Account' with any particular trader, it follows that the applied for mark is not confusing with the [appellant's] mark." Further, with regard to the appellant's registered trademark "Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account", he found:
"... that the public, already familiar to some extent with the [respondent's] house mark 'Firstbank' would consider that the mark 'Firstbank Cash Management Account' indicates a certain type of financial service offered by the [respondent], and would not believe that there was any connection between those services and financial services offered by [the appellant]."
[13]
Thus, the Registrar found no confusion with the appellant's registered mark, and found that there was no likelihood of confusion with the appellant's unregistered mark, as the appellant's prior use of the mark did not establish a reputation and trademark use of the mark in the Canadian market that might give rise to confusion.
[14]
Finally, on the third ground of opposition, distinctiveness, the Registrar concluded:
"... I find that the opponent has not established a degree of distinctiveness for its mark 'Cash Management Account' by the later material date namely, June 27, 1988, sufficient to negate the distinctiveness of the applied for mark."
Deference And Discretion
[15]
Counsel were not substantially in disagreement on the issue of the deference owed to the Registrar's decisions on appeals such as these and on the discretion open to this court. Counsel for the appellant referred me to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 7 (T.D.) where Mr. Justice Dubé stated:
"It is well-established that great caution must be exercised by the court before reversing the original decision of a registrar on purely factual grounds. However, where further evidence is adduced on appeal, the factual situation may be drastically affected,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 72 (F.C.T.D.), and the discretion of the court will be totally unfettered by a previous decision of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  4]
[16]
Counsel for the respondent argued for slightly more deference to the Registrar, emphasizing that part of the quotation above which refers to a factual situation being "drastically affected" by the further evidence filed on an appeal. In counsel's submission, the court's discretion should be exercised de novo only where the new evidence filed dramatically alters the factual situation. He referred me to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), where Mr. Justice Strayer stated:
"While I accept that these appeals involve determinations of fact which I am as entitled as a Registrar to make, in my view the court should be reluctant to reverse the finding of the Registrar or Chairman unless it is clearly satisfied that he came to the wrong conclusion on the facts or unless there is significant new evidence placed before the court that was not before the Registrar."
[17]
Since significant additional evidence was filed on this appeal, I conclude that this court's discretion is essentially "... totally unfettered". While the Registrar's decision is entitled to great weight, it does not relieve me of the responsibility to adjudicate the issues in the light of all of the evidence that is now before the court. Thus, this appeal is in the nature of a trial de novo.
The New Evidence
[18]
As indicated earlier, the Registrar was somewhat critical of the evidence before him on behalf of the appellant/opponent. He did not give much weight to the evidence of spill-over advertising.
[19]
In response to this concern, the appellant filed additional affidavit evidence from John T. Galvin, Vice-President of the Private Client Group and Manager of Key Client Cash Management Account Financial Services Marketing by the appellant, Marc Tremblay and Don Moors, articling students employed by the appellant's solicitors, Robert W. White, Vice-President Canada of the Audit Bureau of Circulation and Karen E. Thompson, a trademark searcher employed by the firm of patent and trademark agents associated with the appellant's solicitors.
[20]
Through his affidavits, Mr. Galvin testified that in 1992, he assumed responsibility for the appellant's product area that included "Cash Management Account" financial services. He testified that the appellant had been successful in obtaining registration of the trademark "Cash Management Account" in the United States and at least eleven other countries in Western Europe, the Middle East, the Far-East and Central America; that the appellant began using its trademarks relevant to this matter in Canada, in association with financial services, at least as early as March 5, 1985; that the appellant's Canadian brokerage business was sold to Wood Gundy in 1990 and that therefore since that sale, the financial services associated with the appellant's trademarks in issue have not been available in association with those trademarks in Canada; that in the early years during which the trademarks were in use, they were advertised extensively on a world-wide basis but that once they became established, advertising was scaled back while nonetheless remaining at a significant level; that advertising was placed in prominent North American magazines having circulation in both Canada and the United States targeting the relevant customer base, that is to say, affluent individuals, typically university-educated professionals of 45 years of age or older with annual incomes in excess of $75,000 U.S.; that to reach the target group, advertising vehicles utilized included
Business Week
,
Fortune Magazine
,
Money Magazine
,
The New York Times Magazine
,
National Geographic
,
The New Yorker
,
Time Business
,
Vogue
,
The Wall Street Journal
and
Working Women Magazine
; that in addition, the appellant's predecessor in title in Canada had placed advertisements in a number of Canadian newspapers and periodicals including
Financial Times of Canada
,
La Presse
,
The Vancouver Sun
,
The Province
, and the
Calgary Herald
; that the appellant's "Cash Management Account" operations in Canada for the years 1986 through 1989 were relatively successful in terms of the number of accounts opened and the value of assets administered in those accounts; and that the appellant's trademarks in issue were displayed extensively in the provision of the services in association with which they were used and that many of the account forms and other related documentation referenced the Royal Bank of Canada, on which the appellant relied for cheque clearance and credit cards services for the accounts.
[21]
On cross-examination on his affidavit, Mr. Galvin acknowledged that his primary focus was in the United States and that he had a general, but not specific knowledge of the appellant's Canadian business which ceased before he assumed responsibility for the appellant's product area that included "Cash Management Account" financial services. He testified that the term "cash management" would be understood by institutions in the United States to refer to the ability to maximize the use of their cash at the lowest cost to them. He acknowledged that he was not familiar with the Canadian market, but assumed that the phrase would have the same meaning in Canada. He acknowledged that his knowledge of the spill-over impact of United States advertisements by the appellants was drawn from the evidence of others. He had no knowledge of ads placed in Canadian regional issues of American publications but he noted that there was no evidence on the record of regional issues of the American publications in which the appellant advertised. He testified that the appellant's "Cash Management Account" product was successful in the Canadian market and was a profitable product. Finally, he indicated that the appellant's predecessor in title in Canada had made direct mailings of brochures for its "Cash Management Account" product involving an expenditure of some $253,000.
[22]
Mr. Tremblay and Mr. Moors testified that, through searches at the Ottawa Public Library and the National Library of Canada, they were able to confirm the spill-over advertising attested to by Mr. Galvin.
[23]
Mr. White attested to the circulation in Canada of the issues of the publications in which spill-over advertising appeared.
[24]
Ms. Thompson testified as to searches she conducted for registrations and pending applications for trademarks including the word "Cash" for banking and financial services; for the words "Manage" and "Managers" and/or "Management" for banking and financial services; and for "Cash" and "Manage" (or "Managers" or "Management") and "Account" for banking and financial services. She testified that her searches disclosed that "Cash" or a term with similar meaning is frequently combined with "Manage" or a similar term in the banking and financial services area but that only the appellant and the respondent have pending applications or registrations including the phrase "Cash Management Account". Ms. Thompson further testified that she had read the affidavit of Alain Leclerc filed on behalf of the respondent before the Registrar and had conducted a computer database search equivalent to a portion of the search reflected in the Leclerc affidavit that revealed significantly different results that were more favourable to the position of the appellant.
[25]
The respondent filed one additional affidavit on these appeals, that being an affidavit of Patrick Smith, an articling student with the solicitors for the respondent. His evidence was substantially in reply to that of Ms. Thompson and related to two on-line computer searches for the term "Cash Management Account".
Analysis
1) Registrability - Confusing With
A Registered Trademark
[26]
By virtue of s. 12(1)(d) of the
Act
, a trademark is registrable if, among other things, it is not confusing with a registered trademark. Section 6(5) requires the Registrar and courts, in determining whether trademarks are confusing, to have regard to all of the surrounding circumstances including the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks and the extent to which they have become known, the length of time the trademarks have been in use, the nature of the wares, services or business, the nature of the trade, and the degree of resemblance between the trademarks in appearance or sound, or in the ideas suggested by them.
[27]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), Mr. Justice Cattanach stated:
"Therefore, where there is a question of confusion between a trademark for which an application for registration is being made and a registered trademark the onus is on the applicant for registration to establish no reasonable probability of confusion and if that onus is not discharged the application ought not to be allowed.
"This is a constant onus and remains as such. It is not comparable to a shifting burden of proof.
"That ultimate onus does not change by reason of the intervention of opposition proceedings."
[28]
Counsel for the appellant argued that in light of the foregoing, the learned Registrar erred in imposing an onus on the opponent/appellant to establish the distinctiveness of its mark, instead of imposing on the applicant/respondent the onus of showing no likelihood of confusion.
[29]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  firmly established that, when trademarks consist of a combination of elements, it is not a proper approach to the determination of whether they are similar to break them up into their elements, concentrate attention upon the elements that are different and conclude that, because there are differences in such elements, the marks as a whole are different. Trademarks may be similar when looked at in their totality even if differences may appear in some of the elements when viewed separately. It is the combination of the elements that constitutes the trademark and gives distinctiveness to it, and it is the effect of the trademark as a whole, rather than of any particular element in it, that must be considered."
Mr. Justice Thorson effectively qualified the foregoing in the same decision when he suggested that a court should seek to put itself in the position of a person who has only a general and not a precise recollection of the earlier mark and then sees the later mark by itself. He goes on to say that if a person so conducting himself or herself would be likely to think that the goods (or services) on which the later mark appears are put out by the same people as the goods (or services) sold under the mark of which he or she has only such a recollection, the court may properly conclude that the marks are similar.
[30]
I am not satisfied that these principles are inconsistent with the Registrar's conclusion on the issue of confusion. The Learned Registrar stated:
"As for the degree of resemblance between the marks in issue, there is necessarily some resemblance owing to the phrase 'cash management services (sic)' common to the parties' marks. However the first portions of the marks, which are the more important for the purposes of distinguishing between the marks, are quite distinct.
"Considering the above, and keeping in mind that the test for confusion is one of first impression and imperfect recollection, I find that the public, already familiar to some extent with the applicant's house mark 'Firstbank', would consider that the mark 'Firstbank Cash Management Account' indicates a certain type of financial service offered by the applicant, and would not believe that there was any connection between those services and financial services offered by opponent Merrill Lynch."
[31]
I do not read the words of the Learned Registrar as implying a breaking up of the marks into their component elements and concentrating attention upon the elements that are different. Rather, I read him to be saying that the effect of each of the trademarks as a whole does not result in confusion because of the inherent distinctiveness of those portions which will create lasting impressions with the relevant public because of their renown or notoriety. I am satisfied that the learned Registrar applied the proper principles to the evidence before him.
2) Entitlement - Confusion
[32]
Section 16(3)(a) of the
Act
provides that an applicant who has filed an application for registration of a proposed trademark, as was the case with the respondent's trademark applications at issue, is, if the trademark is registrable and subject to certain exceptions that are not here applicable, entitled to secure registration of the trademark in respect of the services specified in the application, unless at the date of filing of the application, the proposed trademark was confusing with a trademark that had been previously used in Canada or made known in Canada by any other person such as, in this case, the appellant. The appellant's trademarks here at issue are the registered trademark "Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account" and the unregistered mark "Cash Management Account".
[33]
In
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Mr. Justice Cattanach stated:
"The onus is upon an applicant for the registration of a trademark to establish his right thereto and that onus is constant upon him (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  before an opponent can base an objection on prior use under s. 16 the opponent must establish a reputation in the trade under a style with which confusion may result. That to me is not an onus but a burden of proof. An onus never shifts but a burden of proof does. The applicant may rebut the proof proffered by the opponent."
[34]
There is a burden, then on an opponent to a registration, to actually show the prior use of a mark as a trademark, before the opponent can rely on s. 16. When this burden is discharged, the applicant for registration must show that there will be no confusion with the opponent's mark if the applied for mark is registered.
[35]
The burden on the opponent, in this case, the appellant, was commented on in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Board, where it was stated:
"In view of the clear language in the
British American Bank Note
case, supra, and the consistent reliance on this case by the Trademarks Opposition Board, I consider myself bound to require that an opponent relying on s. 16 of the
Act
, establish a reputation in trade. I do not, however, consider that it is at all clear from the jurisprudence what an opponent must establish in order to show a reputation in trade for this purpose.
"To require an opponent to establish a reputation in trade of the nature that would be required to support a passing-off action or to establish a secondary meaning or acquired distinctiveness such as would satisfy the requirements of s. 12(2) of the
Trade-marks Act
would, at least if applied as a general principle, in my view be clearly inconsistent with the basic intent of s. 16 of the
Act
.
"It appears to me that the requirement to establish a reputation is best viewed as a requirement to establish that the opponent's mark has actually functioned as a trademark, in other words and having regard to the definition of a trademark in s. 2 of the
Trade-marks Act
, that it has been used for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish the opponent's wares or services from the wares or services of others. As such the requirement to establish a reputation could be viewed as simply being one aspect of the requirement under s. 16 of the
Act
to establish prior use.
. . . . .
In the case of a mark which is inherently adapted to distinguish, it would appear that the requirement to establish a reputation could be satisfied by evidence of a usage on a single occasion if one is able to conclude that the mark functioned as a trademark on that occasion. ...
. . . . .
"In the case of marks, however, which are not inherently adapted to distinguish such as descriptive or laudatory words, it appears that there is a heavier burden on an opponent. For such marks, in order to satisfy the requirement for a reputation, it would appear that an opponent must show that there has been
at least some recognition by the public of the mark as a trademark: ...
" (underlining added by me for emphasis)
I am in agreement with the foregoing analysis on the issue of entitlement.
[36]
With regard the appellant's registered trademark, the Registrar commented in his decision on the aspect of "recognition by the public" in the following terms:
"Neither of the parties' marks possesses a high degree of inherent distinctiveness. The opponent's mark consist of two surnames namely, Merrill and Lynch, followed by a descriptive term, while the applied for mark consists of a somewhat laudatory term namely 'firstbank' followed by a descriptive term. The opponent's mark 'Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account'
acquired some reputation in Canada by the material date June 2, 1987
while the applied for mark 'Firstbank Cash Management Account', based on proposed use, had not acquired any reputation at the material date. However, it is relevant that the public would have been familiar with the applicant's mark 'Firstbank' operating as a house mark for various of the applicant's financial services." (underlining added by me for emphasis)
Having found the appellant to have shown prior use, the Registrar determined that there would nonetheless be no likelihood of confusion.
[37]
As regards to the appellant's unregistered mark, the Registrar found that the requisite reputation and prior use had not been established, so there would be no likelihood of confusion. The Registrar found:
"... that the mark 'Cash Management Account', relied on by the opponent ... was not distinctive of the opponent's (or of any other person's) financial services at the relevant date June 2, 1987. Since the public would not associate the mark 'Cash Management Account' with any particular trader, it follows that the applied for mark is not confusing with the opponent's mark."
[38]
I will assess the impact of the fresh evidence filed before this court later in these reasons. I think it appropriate to note at this point, however, that none of the evidence filed by the appellant before the Registrar and before this court really goes to the issue of "recognition by the public" of "Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account" and "Cash Management Account" as trademarks. To some extent it goes to demonstrate the efforts of the appellant to create such recognition but it does not touch on the impact of those efforts.
[39]
I am of the view that, the basis of the evidence before him, the Registrar's conclusions with respect to reputation in Canada of the appellant's marks, and with respect to the issue of confusion, were correct.
3) Distinctiveness
[40]
Section 2 of the
Act
defines "distinctive" in relation to a trademark for services as a trademark that actually distinguishes the services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares and services of others, or that is adapted to so distinguish them. As indicated earlier, the relevant date for determination of distinctiveness in these matters is the date of filing of the statements of opposition that is to say, June 27, 1988 [see footnote 5].
[41]
In
Molson Breweries, A  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 481 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Dubé stated:
"It is well-established that for an opponent to succeed on the ground that a trademark is not distinctive under s. 38(2)(d), he bears an evidential burden to show that its own mark is
known to some extent
: ..." (underlining added by me for emphasis)
[42]
Counsel for the appellant urged me to conclude that, on the facts of this matter, the onus on the appellant in respect of distinctiveness is essentially the same as that with respect to confusion: that the opponent must demonstrate at least some recognition by the public of its mark as a trademark, that is, that the mark actually functioned as a trademark in the market prior to the relevant date.
[43]
My comments with respect to confusion, and with respect to the Registrar's findings on the issue of confusion under s. 16(3)(a) of the
Act
apply equally here. I conclude that, in determining that the appellant's unregistered mark was not distinctive, and that the respondent's marks were distinctive enough to distinguish them from the appellant's registered mark, the Registrar was correct on the evidence before him.
4) The Totality Of The Evidence
[44]
As indicated earlier in these reasons, the evidence before the Registrar on each of the two oppositions was identical. The new evidence before this court on each of the two appeals is also identical. It is also substantial.
[45]
Also as indicated earlier, the Registrar was to some extent critical of the opponent's/appellant's evidence before him.
[46]
The new evidence filed on behalf of the appellant before this court purported to address these concerns.
[47]
It addressed the issue of how the phrase "cash management account" had been used in Canada by the appellant and by third parties, and as a trademark or otherwise.
[48]
Nonetheless, a principal source of the new evidence was once again an officer of the appellant from the United States, Mr. Galvin, who was without first-hand experience of the operations of the appellant in Canada and without first-hand knowledge of the banking, financial and securities businesses in Canada. Surely the appellant, during the time that it was operating in Canada, had officers with such first-hand knowledge who could have attested more directly and more authoritatively to the appellant's "Cash Management Account" operations in Canada. No explanation was provided as to why the evidence of such a former officer of the appellant's operations in Canada was not provided. Of course, the appellant was under no obligation to provide such an explanation. But, in failing to provide such evidence, without explanation, I am satisfied that the appellant has left it open to me to draw a negative inference.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Muldoon cited with approval a case containing the following passage from Wigmore:
"... the failure to bring before the tribunal some circumstance, document, or witness, when either the party himself or his opponent claims that the facts would thereby be elucidated, serves to indicate, as the most natural inference, that the party fears to do so, and this fear is some evidence that the circumstance or document or witness, if brought, would have exposed facts unfavourable to the party. These inferences, to be sure, cannot fairly be made except upon certain conditions; and they are also open always to explanation by circumstances which make some other hypothesis a more natural one than the party's fear of exposure. But the propriety of such an inference in general is not doubted."
I draw such a negative inference, that being that no evidence provided by a former officer of the appellant directly associated with its operations in Canada would have been more favourable to the appellant than the evidence of Messrs. Critchlow and Galvin and might, in fact, have been less favourable to the appellant's case.
[49]
The new evidence did address one concern of the Registrar, in that it established quite authoritively the Canadian circulation figures for the issues of American publications in which the appellant's relevant advertisements appeared, However, I have been left without direct evidence from others active in the business in Canada in which the appellant participated as to the appellant's impact on that business while it was operating here in Canada and, more particularly, on the relatively exclusive segment of the population to which the "Cash Management Account" operations of the appellant were directed. Similarly, I have before me no evidence whatsoever from individual members of that segment of the community as to the impact of the appellant's "Cash Management Account" operations in Canada on them. I am left to infer from the statistical evidence as to the extent of the appellant's "Cash Management Account" operations in Canada, from its use of forms and brochures demonstrating trademark use of "Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account" and "Cash Management Account" in Canada and from its direct advertising and spill-over advertising that there had been at least some recognition by the public of the mark "Cash Management Account" as the appellant's trademark, that the mark had become known to some extent in Canada and there was thus some reasonable probability of confusion if the respondent's marks were registered and used.
[50]
On the totality of the evidence before me, and bearing in mind that this court's discretion is essentially unfettered and that this appeal functions as a trial de novo by reason of the filing of substantial fresh evidence, I find myself unable to draw the inferences that the appellant would have me draw. While the appellant's evidence of its market penetration in Canada with the "Cash Management Account" operations was reasonably impressive in abstract, I cannot conclude that the extent of those operations was significant in relation to the totality of the market in Canada to which the operations were directed. While the appellant's use in a trademark sense of the marks "Merrill Lunch Cash Management Account" and "Cash Management Account" on its forms and in its advertising in Canada was significant, it was certainly not uniform as it related to "Cash Management Account". The evidence disclosed that the appellant regularly used that phrase in a descriptive or nontrademark sense. While the evidence of use of the phrase "cash management account" by others in Canada in the relevant period was not particularly extensive, it was, nonetheless, significant.

Finally, I place little weight on the spill-over impact of the appellant's advertising in American periodicals. I am prepared to take judicial notice of the fact that the periodicals in question were of greater significance to the particular market in Canada to which the appellant's operations were directed than to the general public. Nonetheless, the circulation of those publications in Canada was, generally speaking, somewhat limited. I find the link between the spill-over advertising and the appellant's operations in Canada not to have been well established by the evidence. Overall, I conclude the evidence before me does not establish a reputation in the trade of the appellant with regard to the mark "Cash Management Account".
Conclusion
[52]
Based on the foregoing considerations and analysis, I find the appellant to have failed to discharge the initial burden on it to show a reputation in Canada, a prior trademark use of the mark "Cash Management Account" that would entitle the appellant to succeed on s. 16(3)(a) of the
Act
or on the basis of distinctiveness. I find the respondent to have discharged the onus on it with respect to "... no reasonable probability of confusion". Accordingly, the appeals will be dismissed with costs.
Appeals dismissed.
