Muldoon, J.
: The plaintiffs herein can be appropriately referred to in and by the well-known names of the airlines which they operate: Aer Lingus, Alitalia, British Airways, CP Air, Air France, El Al, Iberia, KLM, the liquidator of Laker Airways, Lufthansa, Sabena, SAS, Swissair and Wardair. In their reamended statement of claim, filed on February 13, 1984, the plaintiff's assert that they are subjected to discrimination and illegal overcharging for landing fees in regard to every transoceanic flight, which the defendants, by certain Air Services Fees Regulations, define to be a flight which crosses an imaginary line described (approximately) as a line which passes through or near Cape Spear, Newfoundland and, to the south, passes through the equator at 45° West Longitude.
[2]
The basis of the plaintiffs' complaint is their allegation that the regulations are ultra vires and null and void ab initio with respect to landing fees. Each plaintiff airline claims a refund and such claimed refunds range in sum from just over $800,000 plus interest on the part of Aer Lingus, to over $12 million plus interest on the part of British Airways.
[3]
A pretrial conference was held at Ottawa on September 18, 1985. The parties' respective solicitors' joint statement of agreed facts was filed on October 4, 1985. They have also jointly prepared nine books of exhibits about which the parties agree that each exhibit is admissible in evidence and true in content. Each side additionally tenders its own "10th" book of exhibits about which they each concede the admissibility of the other's exhibits, but reserve their rights to question the accuracy, weight or interpretation of the other side's documents exhibited therein. The public trial of this action commenced on January 20, 1986, and closed on February 27, 1986, but the last written argument was received only on July 14, 1986.
[4]
The parties' joint statement of agreed facts runs thus:
"The Parties are agreed as follows:
"
The Parties
"1. Each of the plaintiffs operates or has operated airline services between various countries of the world including services to and from Canada.
"2. The defendant, the Minister of Transport, is charged with various public duties pursuant to the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-3, including the construction and administration of all government aerodromes and air stations.
"3. The plaintiffs in the course of carrying out their airline activities at times relevant to these proceedings have used and use airports administered by the Minister.
"
Aeronautics Act
"4. Pursuant to section 5 of the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-3, the Governor in Council, or the Minister upon the former's authorization, may make regulations prescribing charges for the use of:
(a) any facility or service provided by the Minister or on his behalf for or in respect of any aircraft; and
(b) any facility or service not coming within paragraph (a) provided by the Minister or on his behalf at any airport.
"5. By Ministerial Regulations Authorization Order, SOR/70-409, the Minister was authorized by the Governor in Council to make regulations prescribing such charges. That Order is now C.R.C. 1978, c. 126.
"
Air Services Fees Regulations
"6. Pursuant to section 5 of the Aeronautics Act and to the Ministerial Regulations Authorization Order the Minister has made and from time to time amended the Air Services Fees Regulations:
SOR/70-410, effective September 9, 1970
SOR/72-487, effective November 22, 1972
CRC 1978, c. 5, effective January 1, 1980
SOR/82-469, effective April 30, 1982
"7. The types of fees prescribed by the Fees Regulations include or have included, inter alia, various landing fees, general terminal fees, passenger processing fees, loading bridge fees, passenger transporting fees, passenger security services fees, telecommunication services fees, en route facilities and services fees, aircraft parking fees, hangar aircraft storage fees, and goods storage fees.
"8. Up to September 1, 1985, the Fees Regulations prescribed, inter alia, a domestic landing fee, an international landing fee and a transoceanic landing fee in respect of the following categories of flights:
(a) 'domestic flight' - a flight between points in Canada;
(b) 'international flight' - a flight between a point in Canada and a point outside Canada that is not a transoceanic flight; and
(c) 'transoceanic flight' - a flight between a point in Canada and a point outside Canada that passes over the Atlantic Ocean, except a flight between a point in Canada and any point outside Canada lying West of a line running from the most easterly point in Canada to the point of intersection of 45° West Longitude with 0° Latitude.
"9. Up to April 30, 1981, the Air Services Fees Regulations provided that the transoceanic landing fee was payable for the landing at a Canadian airport of an aircraft where such airport was
(a) the last point of landing prior to a transoceanic flight, or
(b) the first point of landing after a transoceanic flight;
and from May 1, 1981, through August 31, 1985, the Regulations provided that the transoceanic landing fee was payable for each landing of an aircraft where that landing concluded a transoceanic flight.
"10. During the times relevant to these proceedings the transoceanic landing fee was payable at a rate greater than that of the international landing fee, and the transoceanic landing fee and the international landing fee were payable at rates greater than that of the domestic landing fee.
"
International Agreements
"11. Canada is a signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on December 7, 1944, and commonly known as the Chicago Convention.
"12. Canada is a signatory to bilateral agreements for air services with Ireland, Israel, Italy, United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, all respectively countries of domicile of the plaintiffs.
"
Fees Paid
"13. Each of the plaintiffs has at relevant times conducted transoceanic flights within the meaning of the Regulations, and has paid transoceanic landing fees in respect thereof.
"14. The plaintiffs have paid to the defendant, Her Majesty the Queen, transoceanic landing fees in the amounts shown on Schedule A hereto.
"
Domestic Revenue Passengers
"15. None of the plaintiffs having a foreign domicile has at any time during the period covered by the present action enjoyed the right to embark domestic revenue passengers at one Canadian airport for their disembarkation at another Canadian airport.
"
Facilities and Services
"16. At the airports used by plaintiffs during the period covered by the present action, all-cargo flights did not and do not use the passenger terminals and their incidence had and has no influence on the facilities provided by the Minister in passenger terminals.
"17. At the passenger terminals of the airports used by plaintiffs during the period covered by the present action, there were and are no separate areas or facilities provided specifically and exclusively for the well-wishers of any particular category of departing international passengers, nor for the greeters of any specific category of arriving international passengers.
"18. The words 'the airports used by the plaintiffs' in the admissions of facts contained in paragraphs 16 and 17 refer to Gander, Halifax, Montreal Dorval, Montreal Mirabel, Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver airports, but do not imply that all such airports were used by all or any of the plaintiffs during or throughout the period in question."
[5]
This action was commenced on March 10, 1980, and each amended statement of claim has expressed the sums of transoceanic landing fees paid from and after 1974 by each plaintiff and claimed therein, and now expressed in Schedule A to the above recited statement of agreed facts. Whatever the outcome as to liabilities, the parties are agreed on Schedule A. the official Record of pleadings, prepared pursuant to rule 487, was filed on March 4, 1985, and it discloses the final formulation of the plaintiffs' claims. They urge that this Court:
"RESERVE plaintiffs' rights in respect of landing fees paid since the dates indicated hereinafter, or to be paid during the day the pendency of the present cause;
"DECLARE the Air Services Fees Regulations ultra vires and null and void ab initio with respect to landing fees;
"ORDER first defendant to pay each of the plaintiffs the following sum respectively:
[This schedule is now subsumed into Schedule A to the parties' statement of agreed facts.]
"ORDER the payment of interest at the legal rate on the foregoing amounts in accordance with law;
"GRANT such further and other relief as ... may seem just;
"THE WHOLE with the costs of this action."
[6]
The plaintiffs' action raises a variety of issues, each of which must be considered separately and in sequence. In the result, however, the plaintiffs' action will be dismissed for the reasons which are now hereinafter expressed, with party and party costs to be paid in favour of the defendants.
THE VALIDITY OF THE REGULATIONS
[7]
The plaintiffs attack the regulations whereby the impugned landing fees were levied on two bases. They assert that those Regulations were beyond the powers delegated by Parliament to the Governor in Council or to the Minister upon the former's authorization; and they assert that, even if technically intra vires, those Regulations are nevertheless still null and void because they are unlawfully discriminatory. One speaks of the impugned Regulations in the past tense because, as of September 1, 1985, the transoceanic landing fee was revoked by a new regulation promulgated as SOR/85-861. As of that date the transoceanic fee was replaced with a new international landing fee to accord with a new definition of "international flight".
Are the impugned regulations null and void by reason of being ultra vires?
[8]
The answer to this threshold question is negative. The Regulations are intra vires.
[9]
The pertinent provisions of section 5 of the Aeronautics Act are recited in paragraph 4 of the parties' statement of facts. The Governor in Council has exercised the power therein conferred by authorizing the Minister to make regulations pursuant to the Ministerial Regulations Authorization Order, C.R.C. 1978, c. 126. It is a very brief order which directly authorizes the Minister to make regulations in precisely the same terms as expressed in section 5 of the Act, including specifically paragraphs 5(a) and (b).
[10]
Section 5 of the Aeronautics Act, and the Regulations prescribed pursuant to it, have been earlier judicially noticed in the case of Pan  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There the appellant airlines, all based in the U.S.A., challenged the legality of fees exacted by the Minister of Transport for telecommunication and en route navigation services provided at their request by and from facilities within Canada. None of their flights landed in Canada, although some of them passed through Canadian airspace. There was no suggestion in that case of any discriminatory charges and so, from that aspect, the Pan American case differs from the case at bar. On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Canada confirming the conclusion of Mr. Justice Mahoney, then of this Court's Trial Division, held that the expression of section 5 of the Act authorizing the "prescribing" of charges connotes not only the fixing of quantum, but also the imposition of liability to pay those charges.
[11]
The discretion conferred upon the Governor in Council and, in turn, upon the Minister of Transport, is broad, profound and virtually unfettered. The discretion to prescribe charges for the use of any facility or service provided by the Minister or on his behalf, at any airport, or for or in respect of any aircraft accords power to charge or not for any facility or service, or not, or for some and not others.
[12]
The charges, as will be seen, have been related to the costs incurred in the provision of the facilities and services by the Minister. They do not need to be so related, but they are. The costs and revenues generated by each particular facility and service provided at each airport are not identified separately. Rather, the "catch-all" method, which accumulates and averages all costs incurred throughout the "system" of this country's international airports (identified in para. 18 of the parties statement of facts, above) is used as the basis for the fixing of charges or fees. An average cost related to the weight of each aircraft or the number of passengers is then calculated. Ideally, the landing charges would be fixed at a rate sufficient to recoup all related costs. Whether the fees charged to the transoceanic sector do recover, or over-recover the full costs related to that sector's use, is a question of fact to which reference will be made.
[13]
The plaintiffs note that their transoceanic flights do not directly engage the facilities and services of every Canadian airport. They do however pay fees charged on the "catch-all" method. This, the plaintiffs argue, renders that method of imposition of fees beyond the powers conferred by the Act. The plaintiffs focus on the emphasized noun in the phrase "charges for the
use
of any facility or service provided ..." in section 5. They argue that they have been charged for airport facilities and services which they did not specifically use. The plaintiffs submit that unless an aircraft has, in fact, landed at an airport and/or, in fact, engaged a particular facility or service, any charge relating to the cost of providing that particular service or facility is surely prescribed outside of the power conferred by the statute. According to the plaintiffs' argument, factual use is the sole statutory criterion for the imposition of charges; any and all other criteria render the imposition of charges invalid.
[14]
Further, the plaintiffs submit that the prescribing of differential charges is ultra vires the statutory enabling power. They urge that since there appears to be no explicit authority to prescribe charges in relation to transoceanic, or any other differentiated class of flights, doing so is in breach of the power conferred by Parliament.
[15]
The defendants contend that the method, manner or basis of prescribing charges, including the transoceanic landing fees, is and always has been quite within the powers of the Governor in Council or the Minister, which Parliament has conferred upon them in section 5 of the Aeronautics Act. The parties are in basic agreement that the only criterion for charging is "for the use of any facility or service provided by the Minister ... in respect of any aircraft; and ... at any airport". The defendants argue that the Minister's almost global discretion is operable in and referable to use of facilities and services of whatever part of the
system
of Canadian international airports; and therefore the prescribing of charges would be ultra vires only if the defendants purported to levy them against some or all plaintiffs (or indeed other airlines) which had
not
used
any
services or facilities at
any
of the system's airports.
[16]
In this new era of a constitutional description of Canada which is more specific than ever before in articulating "the rule of law" as one of the principal foundations and founding principles of Canada, the courts are required not to be so abject in their reverence for the authority of either secondary or primary legislation as they were in previous times. That, of course, does not and never should mean that the judiciary may be cavalier or insouciant about quashing regulations even when urged to quash by highly competent, articulate and perceptive counsel, such as have been engaged by the plaintiffs in the case at bar. It is the duty of the Court to find, and to accord, an interpretation of the statutory provision, which, without straining the words or perverting their meaning, vivifies the impugned regulation. If the impugned regulation cannot be saved pursuant to
the
, or even
an
, ordinary meaning of the statutory prose, so be it.
[17]
The Official Languages Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. O-2, by section 8 thereof exacts that in construing an enactment, both its versions in the official languages are equally authentic. Section 8(2) prescribes the means of avoiding chaos in the event that the parliamentary drafters and translators, as well as the parliamentarians themselves, produce disaccord in those presumably equally authentic versions. Paragraphs 8(2)(b) and (c) although of great interest in a bilingual, bijural federal state are not engaged by the issues at bar. The remaining two paragraphs are pertinent:
"a) where it is alleged or appears that the two versions of the enactment differ in their meaning, regard shall be had to both its versions so that, subject to paragraph (c), the like effect is given to the enactment in every part of Canada in which the enactment is intended to apply, unless a contrary intent is explicitly or implicitly evident;
....
"d) if the two versions of the enactment differ in a manner not coming within paragraph (c), preference shall be given to the version thereof that, according to the true spirit, intent and meaning of the enactment, best ensures the attainment of its objects."
[18]
It is helpful to place the two versions of the pertinent provision of the Aeronautics Act side by side in order to see if the regulation prescribing transoceanic landing fees can be invoked under one or both versions against plaintiffs who use some, but sometimes not all, of the airports of the system for which the Minister has levied landing charges.
"5. The Governor in Council may make regulations, or, subject to and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be specified by him, authorize the Minister to make regulations prescribing charges for the use of
(a) any facility or service provided by the Minister or on his behalf for or in respect of any aircraft; and
(b) any facility or service not coming within paragraph (a) provided by the Minister or on his behalf at any airport."
"5. Le gouverneur en conseil peut établir des règlements, ou, en conformité des modalités qu'il peut spécifier, autoriser le Ministre à établir des règlements prescrivant la taxe relative à l'utilisation
(a) d'une installation ou d'un service fournis par le Ministre ou en son nom, pour un aéronef ou relativement à un aéronef; et
(b) d'une installation ou d'un service qui ne sont pas visés par l'alinéa a) et qui sont fournis, à un aéroport, par le Ministre ou en son nom."
[19]
The two versions are not quite the same, for if they were the English language version, to conform more precisely with the other version, might well speak of "a facility or service ...
an
aircraft; and ...
an
airport". Alternatively, the French language version, to conform more precisely with the other version, might well speak of "
toute
installation ...
tout
service ..." or perhaps "
un
aéronef
quelconque
...
un
aéroport
quelconque
", or either of such formulations. Despite being not quite the same, are the two official versions materially different? Not necessarily, and not at all, if reconciled according to the Official Languages Act.
[20]
The singular indefinite object un (or
une
) in French can be utilized to carry the connotation of
any
in English. In the Pan American case, cited above, it is said (S.C.R. at p. 570): "L'article 5, dans son al. á) emploie les mots "un aéronef" au sens large ...". Clearly, also, the object of section 5 of the Aeronautics Act is to accord a virtually unfettered, almost globally discretionary power to make regulations prescribing charges for the use of the facilities or services at
any
airport. That emphasized word is to be given its ordinary meaning, which in both versions of the statute carries a wide sense or meaning.
[21]
The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, (reset, 1983) defines "any": 1. gen. In sing. = A - no matter which, or what. In pl. = Some - no matter which, of what kind, or how many. ... c. In affirm. sentences: = (constructively)
Every
one of the sort named M.E. 2. Quantitative: = a quantity or number however great or small 1526. 3. Qualitative: = Of any kind or sort whatever; ... etc. ...
[22]
Black's Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979), expresses the following principle meanings of "any": Some, one out of many; an indefinite number. One indiscriminately of whatever kind or quantity. ... Word "any" has a diversity of meaning and may be employed to indicate "all" or "every" as well as "some" or "one" and its meaning in a given statute depends upon the context and the subject matter of the statute.
[23]
The Dictionnaire Juridique/Legal Dictionary - The New Th. A. Quemner Dictionary (1977) - Editions de Navarre, Paris, defines "any" to be: un quelconque, quiconque, tout. (Eg.) any twelve jurors - douze jurés quelconques.
[24]
The above-cited foreign authorities confirm, (if confirmation were needed) this Court's entirely Canadian understanding and interpretation of the word "any" in section 5 of the Aeronautics Act to mean "all", "each and every", or "whichever", among and including the meanings already canvassed. Thus "at
any
airport" in section 5 includes among others the meaning "at each and every, or whichever, airport" at which the Minister provides every and all, or whichever, facilities and services.
[25]
If the drafters who formulate, and the legislators who enact the laws were clairvoyant, they could foresee the precise exigencies of future litigation and they could meet those exigencies, or reject them out of hand. They did neither regard to in these circumstances, necessitating a judicial interpretation of their handiwork. The broad extent of the power to prescribe transoceanic landing fees is a judicial interpretation enlightened by the decisions at first instance and upon ultimate appeal in the Pan American case. The initial reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Mahoney (now of the Appeal Division of this Court) ([1979] 2 F.C. 34) were directly adopted and ratified by the unanimous appeal panel of this Court ((1980), 120 D.L.R.(3d) 574) and referred to with approval by the Supreme Court of Canada. The late Chief Justice Laskin wrote the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court, in which (at p. 572 S.C.R.) appears the following passage:
"Mahoney, J., after reference to dictionary meanings of the term 'prescribe' concluded that s. 5 gave authority not only to fix the charges, but also to impose a legal obligation to pay them. I find no reason to differ from him on this issue and would, accordingly, reject the submission that s. 5 is deficient in its formulation to lay an obligation of payment upon the appellants."
[26]
In response to the plaintiff's contention that the catch-all cost-averaging method of fee-determination is inappropriate, if not unlawful, the defendants submit that such a criticism is irrelevant to the issue of the vires of the regulation by which the charges are imposed. Noting that section 5 of the Act does not express an ulterior purpose or object, such as (for example) "to recover the costs incurred in the provision of airport facilities and services", they assert that the Minister has virtually complete discretion to base the charges on almost anything within reason and outside malice, mischief or despotism, which he wants to utilize. Indeed, upon the true construction of section 5, the Minister is not obliged to try to recover costs or even to establish a cost base. Rather, section 5 confers simply and solely a power to prescribe charges. It is a pricing provision, not a costrecovery provision. As a result, the criticism of the particular, not unreasonable cost base chosen by the Minister as a method of determining charges is quite immaterial in the premises.
[27]
The defendants have related at length the legislative history of the powers which have come to be focussed and formulated in the actual section 5 of the Aeronautics Act. They claim that this history supports their interpretation. Prior to 1966, air services fees regulations were enacted pursuant to the Financial Administration Act, S.C. 1951 (2nd Session), c. 12, which provided:
"18. Where a service is provided by His Majesty to any person and the Governor in Council is of the opinion that
the whole or any part of the cost
of the service should be borne by the person to whom it is provided, the Governor in Council may, subject to the provisions of any Act relating to that service, by
regulation prescribe the fee
that may be
charged for the service
." (emphasis added)
[28]
Regulations made pursuant to the above recited statutory provision are restricted by the cost-recovery object in the first emphasized expression. A fee could be charged only if its purpose were to recover all or some part of the costs of providing the service, and consequently the Governor in Council would reasonably have had to establish the cost base.
[29]
In 1966, Parliament shifted the authority to make air service fee regulations and accordingly, to prescribe charges, out of the Financial Administration Act and into the Aeronautics Act. In so doing the expression concerning "the whole or any part of the cost" was simply deleted, (by S.C. 1966-67, c. 10, section 1). Once this direct reference to the recovery of costs was abandoned, the sole criterion for prescribing charges became the use of any facility or service at any airport. The Governor, or the Minister, was thereupon not required to consider anything else. (Since 1966, two further amendments have been enacted, but neither affects the issue at bar.) So, the defendants correctly submit, Parliament clearly evinced a legislative intent to grant a discretionary pricing power which requires no relating to the costs of providing any facilities and services.
[30]
This interpretation shuns the narrow meaning of section 5 of the Act which the plaintiffs advance. That the legislative history of an enactment can serve as a useful aid to its interpretation was noted by Mr. Justice Pigeon, writing for himself and three other judges of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 667 S.C.R.:
"Legislative history may be used to interpret a statute because prior enactments may throw some light on the intention of the legislature in repealing, amending, replacing or adding to it."
(The above passage is cited as an example in Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd Ed. 1983), p. 160.)
[31]
That the cost-recovery provision was not carried forward into the Aeronautics Act indicates the legislative intention to unshackle the delegated power to prescribe charges for the use of any services and facilities at any airport. That the international airports of Canada have been treated at all material times as a system, indicates that fee attaching use needs only to be of some part of the airport system, but not necessarily the use of all of the airport system's facilities and services, - just those at any airport.
[32]
The Court therefore holds that the impugned Regulations, whereby the transoceanic landing fees were prescribed by the Minister, were in fact and law, and would be again, quite within the powers delegated by Parliament in section 5 of the Aeronautics Act.
Are the impugned transoceanic landing fees null and void because they are discriminatory?
[33]
The answer to this secondary question is negative. The transoceanic landing fees prescribed pursuant to the specified Air Services Fees Regulations are not null and void on the basis of being discriminatory.
[34]
It is quite true, of course, that the transoceanic landing fees prescribed in the various Air Services Fees Regulations in force up to September 1, 1985, are indeed discriminatory. They are discriminatory in that those Regulations discriminated as between domestic flights, international flights and transoceanic flights, with an increasing scale of quantum of fees prescribed respectively for each category of flights. This is illustrated in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the parties' statement of agreed facts, recited above.
[35]
On this basis, too, the plaintiffs assert that, since they have had to pay the highest discriminatory landing fees prescribed by the Regulations, then those regulations are null and void ab initio and ultra vires to the extent that they levy fees in excess of the regular landing fees for international flights. Their statement of claim asks the Court to declare the above described annulments of the Regulations "with respect to landing fees". In view of the earlier conclusion herein about the clear validity of the Regulations prescribing landing fees vis-à-vis section 5 of the Act, the prescribing of landing fees per se cannot be "ultra vires and null and void ab initio". The plaintiffs' complaint must accordingly reside in and against the differential between the higher transoceanic landing fee and the lower international landing fee and the even lower domestic landing fee.
[36]
There is no need to go into matters of legislating for extraterritorial effect, even although one of the two co-ordinates of the imaginary line described in the Regulations is the intersection of 45 degrees West Longitude with the Equator. Despite the fact that the latter co-ordinate is outside of Canada and Canadian territorial waters, the salient fact is the charging of landing fees at any airport in Canada. The Pan American decision, above cited, amply confirms the power to prescribe charges in regard to use of facilities and service by flights crossing the Atlantic Ocean.
[37]
The impugned Air Services Fees Regulations are part of the domestic law of Canada. The parties, in paragraphs 11 and 12 of their above recited statement of agreed facts, have referred to the Chicago Convention of December 7, 1944, and to bilateral agreements with countries which are the corporate domiciles of most of the plaintiffs. The relevance of international law and practice will be considered later herein. At this juncture however, since Canada's domestic law does not recognize a treaty, which is not implemented by competent legislation, the plaintiffs' complaint presents the issue of discriminatory charges wholly in the context of the laws of Canada. It remains to be seen whether these laws ought to be interpreted, if possible, so as to comply with the treaty, or with the ICAO statements/déclarations d'OACI (exhibits 19(a), (b) and (c), jointly submitted).
[38]
In support of their position, the plaintiffs cite a number of judgments, almost all of which reveal a context of municipal law. The few which are not grounded upon the construction of bylaws enacted by municipalities may have been correctly decided, but have been wrongly interpreted by the plaintiffs. As an example, a passage from the headnote of the report of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Trial Division), illustrates its inapplicability, thus:
"Held, judgment is issued in both actions that the inclusion of the words 'registered in Canada' and 'registered in the United States' in sections 9 and 10 of the Regulations is ultra vires the power of the Pacific Pilotage Authority as delegated to it by section 14 of the Pilotage Act. Judgment also issues in both actions for further declarations that: (1) the pilot members of the Authority had
a conflict of interest
in the true equitable sense
when they participated in drafting and passing the Regulation
and did not purge themselves of such conflict of interest at any relevant time; (2) the Authority, in prescribing
the flag of the ship
in sections 9 and 10, was not motivated for the
public purpose of safety within the the meaning and objects
of section 12 of the Pilotage Act, but rather
to obtain personal pecuniary benefit for the pilot members
of the Authority; (3) the S.S. Alaska in the area it ran without a pilot,
posed no threat to safety
within the meaning of section 12 of the Pilotage Act; (4) The Authority, by including those words in the subject regulations,
frustrated the intent of Parliament
that certain ships,
posing no safety threat within the meaning of section 12
, should be excused from compulsory pilotage by exemption or waiver prescribed in the Pilotage Act."
In the above referred to judgment of Mr. Justice Gibson the status of the regulation-making Pacific Pilotage authority, the finding of conflict of interest on the part of its members and the element of the frustration of the will of Parliament all abundantly distinguish that case from the case at bar.
[39]
This is not to say that the wielding of statutory powers delegated to the Governor in Council, or a Minister, is beyond judicial review. As was unanimously held by the Supreme Court of Canada through the words of Mr. Justice Estey in that pre-Charter case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R. (3d) 1, at page 748 S.C.R.:
"Let it be said at the outset that the mere fact that a statutory power is vested in the Governor in Council does not mean that it is beyond review. If that body has failed to observe a condition precedent to the exercise of that power, the court can declare that such purported exercise is a nullity."
Since that is so in regard to the Governor in Council, it is a fortiori so in regard to a Minister, and was so prior to September 1, 1981. However, failure to observe a condition precedent to the exercise of quasi-judicial power is a far remove from the circumstances of the Alaska Trainship case, which, on its facts, is simply inapplicable here, even though the delegated power was legislative in nature, as it is here.
[40]
Ever since, if not before, the judgment of Lord Russell of Killowen in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it has been generally accepted that discrimination is a basis upon which the validity of a municipal school board or other local government bylaw can be challenged. An amply jurisprudence reveals, however, that this principle is confined to "bylaws", that is subordinate legislation enacted by creatures of statute (e.g. municipalities and universities, and the like). The principle does not apply to certain "regulations", that kind of subordinate legislation enacted by the executive branch of government (e.g. the Governor in Council, the Lieutenant Governor, a Minister of the Crown) pursuant to statutory delegation. As was noted by Professor Elmer A. Driedger in Subordinate Legislation (1960), 38 Can. Bar Rev. 1, neither discrimination nor even unreasonableness is a ground for quashing regulations enacted by the executive. Unfair proceedings where the executive itself is constituted to be a review tribunal are indeed reviewable as noted in the Inuit Tapirisat case, but not differential pricing or charges as here. The power to make regulations prescribing charges for use of facilities and services without further fetter, is the power to establish categories of users. If or when, as here, such categories discriminate as between classes of users on the basis of flight origins and destinations, such discrimination does not rob the regulation of its validity.
[41]
Mr. Justice Abbott wrote for the majority in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the circumstances of that case the plaintiff, having paid its broadcasting licence fee for the period April 1, 1960, to March 31, 1961, was confronted with an Order in Council whose effect was to increase the plaintiff's fee for the then current year. The plaintiff paid under protest and, by its petition of right, complained that the order in council was invalid and ultra vires in this, among other respects:
"2. That it is unjust and discriminatory between the [plaintiff, La Presse] and other private commercial broadcasting stations and also between a group of private commercial radio broadcasting, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and other categories of broadcasting stations."
[42]
The pertinent words of Abbott, J., are reported at page 75, thus:
"As to the alleged discriminatory character of the regulation, I am not satisfied that it is in fact discriminatory. In any event s. 3 of the Act puts no limitation upon the powers of the Governor in Council to prescribe licence fees. That such fees may in fact be discriminatory, in my opinion, affords no legal ground of attack upon the validity of the Order."
[43]
Yet another insight into what, if any, sorts of discrimination can stand with impunity is evinced in the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada written by Mr. Justice Le Dain in Cardinal and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 358:
"... This court has affirmed that there is, as a general common law principle, a duty of procedural fairness lying on every
public authority making an administrative decision
which is
not of a legislative nature
and which affects the rights, privileges or interests of an individual: ..." (emphasis not in original)
[44]
This notion of reviewing the validity of administrative decisions which are not of a legislative nature is important to the integrity of legislative power under the Constitution of Canada. Like the provincial legislatures, Parliament is sui generis and is not to be blocked in its intended constitutional regulation of corporate enterprises in matters of trade and commerce, and aeronautics. Discrimination as between classes of enterprises is essential to the wielding of such constitutional powers of legislative regulation, licensing and pricing of the use of facilities.
[45]
Of course, such regulation must not offend the rule of law, especially since the promulgation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Here the discrimination between classes of flights, with equal application of the prescribed charges within each class, leaves the plaintiffs at least technically, if not also practically, free to do business in Canada and to submit to the charges, or not. In these circumstances the law is clear that such discrimination per se is not a ground for annulling the regulation. There is no scent of egregiousness, malice or bad faith upon the evidence here. Arguably such elements could render the regulation null and void. The case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stood, long before the enactment of the Charter as an illustration of the abuse of authority based on irrelevant considerations.
[46]
That which is literally discrimination between categories of flights here has nothing pejorative about it. It may be said equally to be the mere classification of enterprises for the purpose of levying landing fees. The presence of Canadian corporations among the plaintiffs, and the acknowledged fact that Air Canada, although not a plaintiff, was at all material times as subject to the transoceanic landing fee as were the plaintiffs, demonstrates the equal, nondiscriminatory application of the regulation. As will be noted, the chosen basis of classification was not unreasonable and did not include irrelevant, illogical or illegal considerations.
[47]
It seems quite probable that the kind of classification of flights in the impugned Regulations would survive an application to quash even if such kind of classification were evinced in a municipal bylaw. It is not unreasonable and not discriminatory in the pejorative sense of defeating true equality rights. Because the enabling legislation had no objective other than prescribing charges for use of facilities and services, the Minister was not obliged by law to define the differential in prices upon anything other than use of the facilities and services. Nor was he, (as the developing jurisprudence on individual discrimination under section 15 of the Charter amply discloses), obliged to adjust the differential with arithmetic accuracy. It may be noted that the equality and anti-discrimination provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, Appendix III, and of the Charter are human rights which apply to individuals, but not to corporations. The constitutional legislative power to regulate corporate enterprises remains plenary on the part of Parliament and the provincial legislatures in their respective spheres, and it is virtually unfettered, subject to the narrow exceptions already herein discussed. In any event, the material times in the case at bar predate the Charter.
[48]
The Court therefore holds that the impugned transoceanic landing fees were and are not null and void because they are discriminatory. They are not discriminatory, in any event, in the pejorative sense of oppressing the plaintiffs or of confiscating their profit. If the plaintiffs regard the transoceanic landing fees as too great a charge on their cost of doing business in Canada, or as an indication of lack of business sense on the part of the Minister, neither of which is objectively proved, they must accept that such complaints are not justiciable.
THE RELEVANCE OF THE
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS
[49]
In Droit Constitutionnel, Chevrette & Marx, Presses de l'Université de Montréal, 1982, the authors state at pages 1196 and 1197:
"
Droit international et droit interne
. ... un traité ne fait partie du droit interne que s'il y est incorporé par un texte de loi. Le droit international coutumier obéit à cet égard à des règles différentes, le juge national le recevant après s'être assuré que la coutume existe et que le Canada y adhère. Mais dans l'ordre interne la règle de droit international, même si dans certains cas elle n'a pas été formellement incorporée, opère comme un principe général d'interprétation, en tel sens qu'une loi nationale contraire pourra l'écarter à condition de le faire bien clairement, à défaut de quoi on interprétera la loi comme lui étant conforme ou l'on tentera à tout le moins de rendre les deux normes, nationale et internationale, conciliables."
[50]
In Constitutional Law of Canada, Hogg (2nd Ed. 1985), Carswell, Toronto, at pages 245 and 246, the author states:
"Canada's constitutional law, derived in this respect from the United Kingdom, does not recognize a treaty as part of the internal (or 'municipal') law of Canada. Accordingly, a treaty which requires a change in the internal law of Canada can only be implemented by the enactment of a statute which makes the required change in the law. Many treaties do not require a change in the internal law of the states which are parties. This is true of treaties which do not impinge on individual rights, nor contravene existing laws, nor require action outside the executive powers of the government which made the treaty. For example, treaties between Canada and other states relating to defence, foreign aid, the high seas, the air, research, weather stations, diplomatic relations and many other matters, may be able to be implemented simply by the executive action of the Canadian government which made the treaty. But many treaties cannot be implemented without an alteration in the internal law of Canada. For example, treaties between Canada and other states relating to patents, copyrights, taxation of foreigners, extradition, and many other matters, can often be implemented only by the enactment of legislation to alter the internal law of Canada.
...
"But in Canada, where there is no constitutional requirement of parliamentary approval prior to the making of a treaty, it would offend against the basic principle of parliamentary supremacy if the executive could alter the law of the land merely by making a treaty."
[51]
The veracity of the above two quoted statements is confirmed by jurisprudence including the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Pan American case, earlier above cited. There, in [1981] 2 S.C.R. 565, Chief Justice Laskin spoke of the airlines' argument to the effect that they were not required by alleged customary international law to acknowledge Canada's exercise of sovereignty in the airspace above the high seas. Laskin, C.J., dealt with that argument at pages 567 and 568 in this way:
"There is no occasion here to apply a principle of construction favouring the compatibility of domestic law with international law. Either international law invoked in this case is effective because expressly incorporated into Canadian law or the exactions are not, in any event, authorized under Canadian law; there is no other challenge that the appellants can mount."
[52]
Thus, where the international law, either customary or under treaty, is expressly incorporated into domestic law it will operate just as cogently and enforceably as Canadian law. Otherwise, the "exactions" if authorized by Canadian law, as are the transoceanic landing fees, must be paid. If the executive do not seek legislative incorporation of treaties bearing on the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament under the Constitution, Canada could be seen to acquire a poor reputation among nations. Any such complaints brought before the domestic tribunals and courts of Canada are not justiciable, for judicial power alone is incapable of enforcing treaties which are not incorporated into the law by legislative power. There is, however, no cogent evidence which is persuasive on a balance of probabilities to demonstrate that the prescribing of the impugned transoceanic landing charges violated Canada's adherence to the Chicago Convention, or disgraced Canada's membership in ICAO/OACI.
[53]
The pertinent provisions of Article 15 of the Chicago Convention (exhibit 1) are as follows:
"Article 15
"Every airport in a contracting State which is open to public use by its national aircraft shall likewise, subject to the provisions of Article 68, be open under uniform conditions to the aircraft of all the other contracting States. The like uniform conditions shall apply to the use, by aircraft of every contracting State, of all air navigation facilities, including radio and meteorological services, which may be provided for public use for the safety and expedition of air navigation.
"Any charges that may be imposed or permitted to be imposed by a contracting State for the use of such airports and air navigation facilities by the aircraft of any other contracting State shall not be higher,
(a) ...
(b) as to aircraft engaged in scheduled international air services, than those that would be paid by its national aircraft engaged in similar international air services."
The essence of Article 15 is nondiscrimination on the basis of the nationality of foreign aircraft vis-à-vis the contracting State's own national aircraft. No evidence was adduced to indicate even the slightest degree of discrimination between any of the plaintiffs and Air Canada, or as between the Canadian plaintiffs and the foreign plaintiffs. In promulgating the impugned Air Services Fees Regulations, the defendants have behaved legally and honourably in contemplation of Article 15 of the Chicago Convention.
[54]
From time to time the Council of ICAO has issued statements on charges for airports and route air navigation facilities (exhibit 19). In 1974, the Council expressed such a statement (exhibit 19(B)), which contained these pertinent proposed principles:
"10. Charging systems at international airports should be chosen in accordance with the following principles:
(iii) The charges must be nondiscriminatory both between foreign users and those having the nationality of the State of the airport and engaged in similar international operations, and between two or more foreign users."
Again, the plaintiffs have no valid complaint about the landing fees in contemplation of the above recited passage from exhibit 19(B). The expressions "similar international air services" placed in Article 15 of the Convention, and "similar international operations" most certainly bespeak the reality of dissimilar ones, and do not taint the Canadian differential between charges for "international flights" and for "transoceanic" flights.
[55]
The bilateral agreements mentioned in paragraph 12 of the parties' statement of agreed facts are exhibited in Book II, exhibits 3 through 14. Exhibit A from the plaintiffs shows certain references to those agreements in regard to noncompliance with the other contracting party's laws and regulations, and in regard to preferential treatment concerning customs, immigration, quarantine and use of facilities. Non-preference on the basis of nationality is covenanted by Canada with other countries, in these provisions:
Denmark:
art. 4(1)
- (ex. 4)
France:
art. 7(1)
- (ex. 5)
Germany:
art. 8(1)
- (ex. 6)
Israel:
art. VIII(1)
- (ex. 8)
Netherlands:
art. VIII 1.
- (ex. 10)
Norway:
art. 3(1)
- (ex. 11)
Sweden:
art. 3(1)
- (ex. 12)
Switzerland:
art. VIII 1.
- (ex. 13)
[56]
An example of such a nondiscrimination provision is that of the 1974 treaty with the Netherlands which came in force definitively on July 15, 1975 (exhibit 10) and which happens to be expressed in both of Canada's official languages, and legibly:
"Article VIII
"1. The charges imposed in the territory of either Contracting Party for the use of airports and other aviation facilities on the aircraft of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party shall not be higher than those imposed on aircraft of a national airline engaged in similar international air services."
In regard to the impugned transoceanic landing charges, it is plain that the plaintiff KLM adduced no evidence upon which to support any complaint herein pursuant to article VIII 1. of the above mentioned agreement between Canada and the Kingdom of The Netherlands, assuming this Court to be an appropriate forum, which it is not.
[57]
Moreover, the ICAO statement of 1974, jointly tendered as exhibit 19(B), to which much reference was made by the parties, appears to countenance a certain degree of real preferential treatment, no less. Among the principles enunciated in section S9 there appears:
"(viii) Where any preferential charges, special rebates, or other kinds of reduction in the charges normally payable in respect of airport facilities are extended to particular users [that which is not repudiated herein], governments should ensure as far as practicable that any resultant under-recovery of costs properly allocable to the users concerned is not shouldered onto other users."
Now this edifying but non-binding principle whereby preferential charges, rebates or other reductions may truly be countenanced, according to ICAO, is probably the basis of the plethora of expert evidence and testimony on accounts, accounting, accounting principles and time-and-motion observations which were submitted in detail to the Court.
[58]
It must be remembered that the Minister's statutory authority to prescribe charges for the use of any facility or service at whatever airports is a pricing authority which is not fettered by cost considerations. In the event of incompatible principles being enunciated by ICAO and the Chicago Convention on one side, and by the Aeronautics Act with its wholly intra vires Regulations on the other side, the Court would be bound to respect the Act and the Regulations, since the international involvements are not specifically incorporated into Canadian law. But, although not obliged to apply the civil aviation association's principles slavishly, or with mathematical precision, or at all, the Minister has managed to abide pretty closely by them.
[59]
Indeed ICAO's stated principles are so general and qualified as to be serviceable only as guidelines, but hardly as legislation. The gravamen of these princples is cost, as distinct from Parliament's emphasis on pricing exclusively. In addition to principle (vii) set forth is section S9 of exhibit 19(B), the others (with emphasis added) are:
"(i) The cost to be shared is
the full economic cost to the community of providing the airport and its essential ancillary services
, including
appropriate amounts for interest on capital investment
and
depreciation of assets
, as well as the
cost of maintenance and operation
and
management and administration expenses
, but allowing for all revenues, aeronautical or nonaeronautical, accruing from the operation of the airport to its operators.
"(ii) An allocation of costs should be considered in respect of space or facilities utilized by government authorities.
"(iii) The proportion of costs allocable to
various categories of users
, including State aircraft, should be determined on an equitable basis,
so that no users shall be burdened with costs not properly allocable to them according to sound accounting principles
.
"(iv) In general aircraft operators and other airport users should not be charged for facilities and services they do not use,
other than those provided for and implemented under the Regional Plan
.
"(v) Under favourable circumstances airports may produce sufficient revenues to exceed by a reasonable margin all direct and indirect costs (including general administration, etc.) and so provide for retirement of debt and for reserves for future capital improvements.
"(vi) The users' capacity to pay should not be taken into account until all costs are fully assessed and distributed on an objective basis. At that stage the contributing capability of states and communities concerned should be taken into consideration, it being understood that
any State or charging authority may recover less than its full costs
in recognition of local, regional, or national benefits received.
"(vii) [previously recited]
"(viii) Airport charges levied on international general aviation,
although needing to respect Article 15 of the Chicago Convention
, should be assessed in a reasonable manner, having regard to the cost of the facilities needed and used and the goal of encouraging the growth of international general aviation."
[60]
The weight and preponderance of credible evidence indicates that although Parliament conferred a broad pricing authority upon the Minister to prescribe charges for use of facilities and services, the transoceanic landing fees prescribed by him evince negligible, if any, departure from ICAO's suggested principles. So, even if the defendants' adherence, or not, to those principles were justiciable in this Court, the evidence discloses that the Minister's effort in prescribing the impugned landing fees is good enough. It did not violate the principles. Strict arithmetical accuracy is not necessary in this regard, despite the parties' counter-fulminations of reams of contradictory expert accounting postulations.
WERE THE PLAINTIFFS "OVERCHARGED"?
[61]
In view of the initial findings herein to the effects that the impugned Air Services Fees Regulations are quite intra vires of section 5 of the Aeronautics Act and not null and void for being allegedly discriminatory, the brutal truth is that whether or not the plaintiffs have been "overcharged" is of no legal consequence. In prescribing the charges, the Minister bears a responsibility for the risk that if he charges too much he could drive away the plaintiffs' business and precipitate retaliation by the airport authorities of their countries of origin. He could drive the Canadian plaintiffs out of business. Since the plaintiffs continued to pay the landing charges their continued use of Canadian airports was their own voluntary act based on business decisions. They paid under protest from about the time they commenced this action. Successive Ministers have been responsible to Parliament, to their cabinet colleagues and to the government caucus. The plaintiffs, all corporate entities, are managed and directed by persons who are responsible to their shareholders or their State owners.
[62]
In the normal course of events the Minister of the day, controlled no doubt by his particular responsibilities, had regard to costs when prescribing landing charges. He has not been obliged to do so in terms of the power conferred by Parliament in section 5 of the Act; but in the normal course of events the Minister would, and did, have regard to cost. That, indeed, is indicated strongly by the evidence which also discloses by exhibit 218, the Auditor General's report, that the system of the eight international airports have lost a great deal of money. That is another way of describing nonrecovery of costs. Whatever that "full economic cost to the community of providing the airport and its ancillary services" might be, it seems apparent that the community of Canadian taxpayers has borne the far greater part of the burden.
[63]
The witness whose documentary and oral evidence was most cogent and credible on this issue is Gordon Clare Wilson. Mr. Wilson, since August, 1978, has been the financial adviser in the rate economics branch of the Canadian Air Transportation Administration (CATA). After graduating in 1973 with an Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree from Carleton University, he joined the Canadian Transport Commission's staff for a short time, working as a research assistant in a project on airline operating costs. In October, 1973, he became employed by Statistics Canada, the aviation statistics branch where he acquired valuable experience for his present employment and his credibility in this case. At the time of his testimony, Mr. Wilson had participated in all of the activities of the rate economics branch which is responsible for the cost recovery program of CATA. He has been involved in the preparation of financial information used, and to be used, in the development of fee proposals to the industry.
[64]
The record of Mr. Wilson's viva voce testimony extends from page 2584 (vol. 13) of the transcript to page 2843 (vol. 14). This knowledgeable witness described in simple historic terms the development of the landing fees from years before the institution of the international landing fees in 1957, to their merger with the transoceanic landing fees in 1985, and the consequent elimination of the latter on September 1 of that year. (Transcript: pp. 2610 to 2621) Those developments are shown also in exhibits 220 through 223.
[65]
CATA's methodology brought about a reduction of the transoceanic fee on May 1, 1982, and Mr. Wilson explained the matter thus:
"A. Well, the methodology that we had adopted is one that in looking at the costs and revenues of the international airport system would come to an amount that we call the 'break-even landing fee,' and that as long as everyone is being charged less than that break-even landing fee, it was our position that no one was paying for the full costs.
"As a result of major changes in the revenue picture of these airports, other than through landing fees, and some changes on the costs side, the situation was such that without reducing the transoceanic landing fee that fee would have exceeded the break-even landing fee. And consistent with our methodology, we took the step of reducing that fee." (Transcript: (vol. 13) p. 2618)
[66]
Over the time span from 1976, when the fees increased by 30%, to September, 1985, when the transoceanic landing fee was eliminated, the domestic and international fees grew at a greater rater than the transoceanic fee. Mr. Wilson testified:
"... If I remember the figures correctly, over a 10-year period, culminating in the September, 1985, increases, the domestic was increased something like 272 per cent; the international, 240 per cent; and the transoceanic was 14 per cent higher than it had been 10 years earlier." (Transcript: (vol. 13) p. 2620)
[67]
The methodology utilizes a "catchall" or "residual" fee, and is the system employed at several, if not all, foreign airports throughout the world. The plaintiffs' witness Cornelius Lakeman, retired head of the international affairs department, Flight Operation Division at KLM, testified, thus:
"Q. Some airports attempt to segregate landside and airside to some extent?
A. Some airports do.
...
Q. Many do not?
A. Many do not.
...
Q. All right. And you would agree with me that with respect to methodology there is a wide range of practices right across the world as to how he gets to those final fees?
A. Yes.
Q. Yes. But that for the most part, the fee which winds up being charged as the balanced costs and revenues is the landing fee?
A. Yes."
(Transcript: (vol. 2) pp. 288 & 289)
[68]
Mr. Wilson, on cross-examination, reiterated the technique of discovering the break-even landing fee and his explanation is recorded at p. 2791 of the transcript (vol. 14). The transoceanic and other carriers have the benefit of the revenues from the concessions and rental enterprises which fall into the "catch-all" thereby reducing the costs otherwise chargeable against the airlines. This technique is in sweet accord with ICAO's principle S9(i), above recited, as revealed in exhibit 19(B).
[69]
Exhibit 223, produced by Mr. Wilson (transcript: (vol. 14) pp. 2662 & seq.) demonstrates the calculation of the break-even landing fee in the international airport system. The source of the sums in the first part of ex. 223 is the cost and revenue statements, for the year 1982-83, which appear on page 10 of exhibit 185. Exhibit 223 indicates that in order to achieve full cost recovery in the international airport system, all categories of flights would have had to be charged a landing fee of $2.25 per 1,000 pounds. In fact, the landing fees, effective May 1, 1982, per 1,000 lbs. were: transoceanic, $1.62; international, $1.38; and domestic $0.91.
[70]
So, the defendants argue, even after the subsidy from the air transportation tax, the defendants were providing a subsidy of $0.63 per 1,000 lbs. to the transoceanic sector, $0.87 to the international sector and $1.34 to the domestic sector. A subsidy of $0.63 per 1,000 lbs., the defendants assert, represents a subsidy of $485 for each landing of a Boeing 747's transoceanic flight. Exhibit 266 indicates a break-even landing fee of $2.80 per 1,000 lbs. in 1978-1979, when the rate of the transoceanic landing fee was $2.06.
[71]
It must be noted that the air transportation tax is not an airport revenue. It is levied on the price of transportation by aeroplane, but the fare paid is not always for departure from an airport. It could be for departure from a lake or river or an open field. This tax is on the air fare alone. It is not an airport user charge. Accordingly if the government gives some of this tax revenue as a subsidy for the airports, that fact alone does not make the whole tax revenue accountable in and with revenues such as duty-free sales, general terminal fees, or landing fees. Although the plaintiffs may gain benefit from such subsidy using tax revenues, that process is truly res inter alios acta insofar as the plaintiffs are concerned.
[72]
CATA calculated the break-even landing fee in the same manner in every year. In 1981, the forecast indicated that the transoceanic fee would exceed the break-even landing fee and the transoceanic landing fee was significantly reduced in order to avoid overcharging the affected carriers. This is established by Mr. Wilson's testimony, recorded at pages 2805 and 2806 of the transcript (vol. 14).
[73]
The experts, evincing all the usual strengths and weaknesses of their genre, have tried to show how the plaintiffs were overcharged, or not, depending upon which side sought and bought their expertise. The Court, after assessing the witnesses in person and after reviewing the transcript of their voluminous testimony and the voluminous exhibits, comes to certain conclusions.
[74]
The Court prefers the evidence of Steven O. Gunders over that of Alan S. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham asserts that the statements of the airports revolving fund (ARF) fairly represent the operations of the airports from time to time included in the ARF system. His report (exhibit 211) presents his analysis of the over or under recovery by sector on the basis of the unadjusted ARF cost base. This is manifestly erroneous and renders his analysis unreliable. The Auditor General of Canada expressed an unfavourable opinion (exhibit 212) about the ARF financial statements for several reasons, notably (p. 27.25) that "an amount representing the Government's interest expense associated with the capital invested in the fund" is not considered. So said David Lawrence Meyers, Deputy Auditor General in his testimony recorded at p. 2468 of the transcript (vol. 13). The passages on cross-examination of Mr. Cunningham recorded on pp. 2175 through 2177 (vol. 11) are significant elements in discounting his evidence. Another aspect of this witness' evidence which creates grave doubt about his and its objectivity is the anomolous "technique" of allocating all revenue generated by the duty-free shops concession to the international sector and then assuming that all other sources allocated in proportion to passenger volume. Again, at pp. 2280 and 2281 (vol. 12) Mr. Cunningham is recorded, and he did testify, to the effect of abdicating his professional role in favour of Mr. Hart, another witness, and the plaintiffs' representations, "And it was more or less a committee decision that the allocation of costs and revenues on a passenger basis was indeed fair". These examples of the witness' approach to the issues drain all confidence in his professionalism and objectivity. They, among others, scuttle his credibility.
[75]
On the other hand, Mr. Keith Boocock stood out in experience, expertise and credibility. The Court accepts this witness' evidence as well as that of Philip Beinhaker wherever they might face conflicting evidence.
[76]
The Court is amply persuaded on a positive preponderance of probabilities that none of the plaintiffs has been overcharged in paying the transoceanic landing fees.
RESTITUTION
[77]
If the earlier findings of this Court, to the effect that the impugned Air Services Fees Regulations are valid and wholly intra vires be held subsequently to be incorrect, the plaintiffs claim that they would be entitled to restitution. The defendants contend that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the return of transoceanic landing fees paid prior to the commencement of this litigation on March 10, 1980, because they say, those fees were paid under mutual mistake of law and not under any compulsion from the defendants.
[78]
Because the Court accepts the evidence and testimony of Steven O. Gunders and the defendants' other witnesses, it finds that the differing gradations of flights defined to be "domestic", "international" and "transoceanic" were justified and not unreasonable in regard to allocation and generation of costs of and for the international airports. It follows that if the regulations were ultra vires on the basis that the costs of unvisited or seldom visited airports ought not to be charged to the plaintiffs, then each plaintiff would be entitled to a prorated deduction from the landing fees factually paid since 1974 in regard to landings in the common law provinces and since 1975 in regard to landings in Québec. It also follows that if the differential discrimination in the very gradations or categories of flights be a basis for holding the impugned regulations null and void and inoperative in regard to the so-called discriminatory categorizations, then the regulations are severable in regard thereto and the plaintiff having complained specifically of the transoceanic fee, cannot escape paying the next lower fee, domestic or international, from time to time emplaced.
[79]
In regard to fees paid for landings in Québec, there is no distinction to be drawn between money paid under mutual mistake of law or mistake of fact. If the regulations were ultra vires or to the extent they are severable and somewhat inoperable, in those regards the plaintiffs were never indebted to the defendants. In any such event, articles 1047 and 1140 of the Civil Code of Québec will govern the matter of restitution.
[80]
In regard to restitution of money paid in regard to landings in the common law provinces, the same considerations about the effect and noneffect of the regulations applies as between whether they be ultra vires or null, void and inoperable but severable.
[81]
The plaintiffs' case involves the same kind of mistake as those found in:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[82]
In the Nepean Hydro case above cited, Mr. Justice Estey, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, at pages 398 and 399, adopted the finding of the trial judge, who said:
"In my view the payments were made without protest in the sense that it intended to preserve legal rights. Nepean did voice its objections from time to time; but in my view the circumstances do not go beyond what can be described as quibbling and grumbling. It cannot be inferred from the circumstances that the payments were involuntary in the legal sense."
In this case, although the action was commenced on March 10, 1980, the plaintiffs' declaration was amended up to February 9, 1984, and they are entitled to be considered as having paid under protest from at least the commencement of the action until the respective dates shown in the annex to their statement of agreed facts. If any plaintiff did separately assert a provable, serious protest - apart from grumbling and quibbling - prior to commencing this action, such plaintiff shall be absolved of having made voluntary payments as of such earlier date. Such payments would be made under compulsion. All of the rest of the plaintiffs did not pay under compulsion.
[83]
Further, in the Nepean Hydro case, Estey, J., summarized his decision (p. 411, S.C.R.) and the effect of his judgment highlights the foregoing observation. Estey, J., reiterated that generally, a payment made under a mistake of law is not recoverable. Recovery may be permitted, however, in two kinds of cases: cases involving compulsion and cases of illegal transactions. In the former, "recovery is allowed as the payment is not made voluntarily and there is no reason to suppose, only because of the fact of payment, that the plaintiff had surrendered his right to recover his moneys paid under practical compulsion". In the latter (i.e. cases of illegal transactions), recovery is permitted if the parties were not in pari delicto. In the absence of either of those elements, as in the case at hand, the mutual mistake of law rule operates to deny recovery under the common law.
[84]
There was a strong dissent by Mr. Justice Dickson, now Chief Justice, with the concurrence of Laskin, C.J., in the Nepean Hydro case. However, it is not for this Court to prefer the minority opinion over the majority opinion.
[85]
Clearly if any restitution is, in fact, to be made, a reference will have to be formulated and undertaken either according to the above terms or those imposed by an appellate Court.
[86]
In the final result, however, the plaintiffs' action is dismissed, effectively under rule 338(2) as of February 24, 1987, with party and party costs of the defendants to be paid, after taxation thereof, by the plaintiffs.
Action dismissed.
