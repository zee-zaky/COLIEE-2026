Muldoon, J.
: The applicant, who is a prison inmate incarcerated by order of the National Parole Board (the "N.P.B.") until his warrant expiry date moves for an interim prohibition to prevent a detention hearing by the N.P.B. from being held on its scheduled date of May 23, 1996, at Warkworth Institution. The substantive ground expressed in the applicant's notice is:
"(b) The [this] application will be rendered moot and the applicant's liberty interest as guaranteed by section 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
[the
Charter
] will be infringed if this matter is not decided at least on an interim basis before May 23, 1996. The court is asked to proceed in this manner pursuant to section 24(1) of the
Charter
."
[2]
As it happened, the applicant's counsel effectively abandoned the
Charter
invocation in argument, relying instead on an interpretation which he urged be given to s. 129(3)(b) and subs. 129(3.1) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
. They run thus:
"129(3) Where the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that an offender who is serving a sentence of two years or more is likely, before the expiration of the sentence according to law, to commit an offence causing death or serious harm to another person,
a sexual offence involving a child
or a serious drug offence, the Commissioner shall refer the case to the Chairperson of the Board together with all the information in the possession of the Service that, in the Commissioner's opinion, is relevant to the case, as soon as is practicable after forming that belief, but the referral may not be made later than six months before the offender's statutory release date unless
. . . . .
(b) as a result of
any
recalculation of the sentence
under this Act
, the statutory release date of the offender has passed or less than six months remain before that date.
"129(3.1) Where paragraph (3)(b) applies and the statutory release date has passed, the Commissioner shall, within two working days after the recalculation under that paragraph, make a determination whether a referral is to be made to the Chairperson of the Board pursuant to subsection (3) and, where appropriate, shall make a referral, and the offender is not entitled to be released on statutory release pending the determination."
[3]
A recalculation of the term of imprisonment's statutory release date had indeed taken place. Although many members of the Correctional Service of Canada (C.S.C.) had reviewed and scrutinized the applicant's release date and concluded it to be June 24, 1996, one perceived that a nine month term imposed by Judge Batten had been omitted, which when correctly added put the statutory release date at February 24, 1997.
[4]
The essential facts are provided in the uncontested affidavit of John B. Wilson, regional manager, Conditional Release Programs, Ontario Region, N.P.B. Here are pertinent passages of Mr. Wilson's affidavit:
"5. Until February 14, 1996, the information provided to the NPB by CSC indicated that the applicant's Warrant Expiry Date was June 24, 1996. On February 14, 1996 the NPB received from the Commissioner of CSC a Referral for Detention Review with respect to the applicant. The Commissioner's Referral indicated that a sentence recalculation had occurred on February 13, 1996, which determined that the applicant's Warrant Expiry Date is actually February 24, 1997. A true copy of the Commissioner's Referral, and accompanying non-privileged documents, is attached as Exhibit 'B' to this my affidavit.
6. On February 16, the NPB notified the applicant that as a consequence of the facts indicated in the preceding paragraph, a Detention Review would be held by the NPB concerning him on March 13, 1996. The true copy of the letter of notification is attached as Exhibit 'C' to this my Affidavit.
7. I am informed by Marie Cuillerier, Sentence Administrator at Warkworth Institution, and I verily believe, that on February 22, 1996 the applicant signed an authorization permitting Warkworth Institution to provide to 'my lawyer John Hill' copies of warrants of committal and the most recent sentence computation. I am further informed by Ms. Cuillerier, and verily believe, that Warkworth faxed the requested material to Mr. Hill on February 26, 1996.
8. Also on February 26, 1996, the applicant requested a postponement of his Detention Review, then scheduled for March 13, 1996, 'in order to secure legal counsel'. In the same document, the applicant wrote that '[m]y lawyer has asked that I request that my hearing be scheduled at the latest date in May as is possible'. A true copy of the applicant's postponement request form is attached as Exhibit 'D' to this my Affidavit.
9. In compliance with the applicant's request for postponement, the NPB rescheduled the applicant's Detention Review. The applicant was informed on April 24, 1996 at the very latest that the date to which his hearing was postponed was May 23, 1996."
Indeed, the detention hearing has been so postponed at the applicant's request.
[5]
The applicant's counsel does not purport that the N.P.B. is biased against the applicant, but he urges that the N.P.B. has a "propensity" to accept the Commissioner's allegations because it accepted to set a detention review hearing. The court does not accept this argument for it is patently misguided.
[6]
The applicant's counsel urges a "liberal" rather than a "strict" interpretation of s. 129(3) of the
Act
, because (a) to apply it strictly in these circumstances would be to condone shoddy work by all the C.S.C. personnel who missed noticing the sentence pronounced by Judge Batten, which Ms. Cuillerier noticed, (b) the shoddy work is akin to officially induced error misleading the applicant not to seek admission to various inmate programs, (c) the mistaken belief plus the [correct] additional term of imprisonment affecting the applicant's "liberty interest", the N.P.B. should not be granted jurisdiction to hear the scheduled detention review.
[7]
The additional term is correct. If the shoddy performance's error had not been corrected, the applicant would have benefitted by release on June 24, next. Also the matter of the N.P.B.'s alleged lack of jurisdiction, not having been asserted as a ground cannot now be considered by this court. It is a wrong argument in any case. The correction of the C.S.C.'s error cannot in any sense deprive the N.P.B. of the jurisdiction to hold the detention review.
[8]
The question here, for the applicant, is how and where he will serve his correct term of imprisonment - in prison or outside - on statutory release.
[9]
There are other means for punishing the C.S.C. for dashing the applicant's expectations, if that be actionable, but prohibiting the detention hearing is not one.
[10]
However this application is premature. This court does not have first instance jurisdiction to act upon or dispose of a Commissioner's reference. That is conferred on the N.P.B. according to subs. 129(3). This court should not purport to usurp the place of the N.P.B. by making a decision on the applicant's counsel's argument on how to interpret subs. 129(3) of the
Act
before the N.P.B. makes its decision on that point. The N.P.B.'s jurisdiction is just not to be usurped, under the
Act
, which provides:
"107(1) Subject to this Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act, the Transfer of Offenders Act and the Criminal Code, the Board has exclusive jurisdiction and absolute discretion
(a) to grant parole to an offender;
(b) to terminate or to revoke the parole or statutory release of an offender, whether or not the offender is in custody under a warrant of apprehension issued as a result of the suspension of the parole or statutory release;
(c) to cancel a decision to grant parole to an offender, or to cancel the suspension, termination or revocation of the parole or statutory release of an offender;
(d) to review and to decide the case of an offender referred to it pursuant to section 129; and
(e) to authorize or to cancel a decision to authorize the unescorted temporary absence of an offender who is serving, in a penitentiary,
(i) a
life sentence
imposed as a minimum punishment or commuted from a sentence of death,
(ii) a
sentence for
an indeterminate period, or
(iii) a sentence for an offence set out in Schedule I or II."
[11]
The N.P.B. is therefore quite competent to hear and consider the applicant's arguments (despite his assertion of lack of jurisdiction, dismissed above) and it does enjoy first instance jurisdiction in these circumstances. If, after the detention hearing, the applicant thinks that the N.P.B. has gone off the rails and committed a reviewable error, he may then institute an appropriate motion for judicial review, and this court will then exercise its discretion to grant it or not.
[12]
For the foregoing reasons, this application for interim prohibition is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
