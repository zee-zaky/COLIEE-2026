Simpson, J.
: The applicant is a Jewish citizen of Moldova, and he is Russian speaking. The Board accepted his evidence and concluded that he suffered discrimination at his job and in his job search efforts. It also concluded that he suffered harassment and one beating by reason of his Jewish heritage. The Board, however, did not find that the applicant had an objectively well-founded fear of persecution. It found instead that he was a victim of discrimination.
[2]
The issue raised by the applicant is whether the Board ought to have commented on certain documents in addition to those mentioned in the reasons. As a starting point in my analysis, I should note that the Board cannot comment on all documents in its record, and the fact that no mention is made of a document does not necessarily mean that the document has been ignored. It is reasonable to presume that the Board will consider all important documents.
[3]
However, the question is when is a document so important that it must be specifically mentioned in the decision. Or put another way, when will a failure to refer to a document be considered a reviewable error?
[4]
In my view, a document need only be mentioned in a decision if, first of all, the document is timely, in the sense that it bears on the relevant time period. Secondly, it must be prepared by a reputable, independent author who is in a position to be the most reliable source of information. Thirdly, it seems to me that the topic addressed in the document must be directly relevant to an applicant's claim. For example, documents sent to or received by an applicant, or prepared for an applicant, or about an applicant, which bear on relevant issues would, in the ordinary course be mentioned in reasons. In addition, if a document is directly relevant to the facts alleged by an applicant, one would expect to see that document addressed in the Board's reasons. On the other hand, numerous other documents may be only marginally relevant. In my view, it is not a reviewable error for the Board to fail to deal with such documents in its reasons.
[5]
In this case, the Board did not refer to two items. The first was a document which was marked as Exhibit C-4. It was a commentary written by a Mr. Alex Benifand on a report which appears to have been prepared for the IRB. It related to, among other things, the circumstances experienced by the Jewish community in Moldova. In his commentary, Mr. Benifand disagreed with certain findings in the IRB report. He did not appear to reject the report as a whole, but mentioned that he had a concern that hate propaganda continued to exist in Moldova, and that it created serious stress on members of the Jewish community. He also mentioned that there have been serious anti-Semitic incidents in Moldova, such as burglary and defacing of cemeteries, and in one case at least, a murder. He mentioned that Jews were often the first to be laid off during corporate lay-offs.
[6]
Mr. Benifand's commentary was not mentioned in the Board's decision. Instead, the Board relied on documents which provided information from members of the Jewish community in Moldova about the situation there. One of the authors was the President of the Federation of Jewish Communities, who said that there was no anti-Semitism in respect of either state policy or social phenomena. The Board also quoted from the IRB study that was criticized by Mr. Benifand. That study said that state financing in Moldova had been provided for the Department of Jewish Studies at the university, and that Jewish synagogues and cultural groups were reopening in Moldova.
[7]
The Board did not expressly reject Mr. Benifand's comments, and that is the source of the difficulty. The Board failed to address his commentary in positive or negative terms. In my view, an express reference was unnecessary for two reasons. Firstly, Mr. Benifand's concerns for the most part did not mirror those raised by the applicant. The applicant was not concerned about hate propaganda and did not say that he had been the victim of vandalism or burglary, or incidents of that kind. Secondly, Mr. Benifand's comments were less authoritative than those from members of the Jewish community in Moldova. Accordingly, I find that there was no reviewable error in the Board's failure to specifically address Mr. Benifand's commentary.
[8]
In addition, there were other documents which dealt generally with discrimination against ethnic minorities in Moldova, to which the Board did not make specific reference. Those documents did not specifically address the Jewish situation. Accordingly, the Board's failure to mention them does not constitute a reviewable error.
[9]
The application is therefore dismissed.
Application dismissed.
