Reed, J.
: The defendants bring a motion to set aside a default judgment which issued against them on July 8, 1992. In accordance with the terms of that judgment, the prothonotary undertook an assessment of damages and costs. A report with respect thereto issued on April 25, 1994. It recommended an award to the plaintiff of $185,600, with interest thereon, calculated at the bank prime commercial lending rate plus one, from October 8, 1984. Costs of $4,614.21 were also assessed. If the motion to set aside the default judgment is successful the defendants also seek to have the plaintiff's statement of claim struck out.
[2]
The motion to have the default judgment set aside is brought pursuant to rule 439(3). The motion to strike the statement of claim is brought pursuant to rule 419. Both motions are grounded on the assertion that this court has no jurisdiction over the individually named defendants and, in any event, that it has no jurisdiction to award damages in a claim such as the present.
[3]
In order to set aside a default judgment, except in cases where there is no jurisdiction, a defendant must demonstrate that there is both a reasonable explanation as to why the action was not defended earlier and that a good defence on the merits exists. I will describe, first, the background facts, then discuss the defendants' explanations for not having defended earlier and the merits of the defence they now assert. Lastly, I shall deal with the jurisdictional arguments.
Background Facts
[4]
The plaintiff's affidavit evidence indicates that in 1942 he purchased 8.59 acres on the South Saanich Indian Reserve (the Tsartlip Reserve). I refer to this as a purchase of land because that is how it is described in the plaintiff's affidavit and other documents. What is involved is the transfer of the use and possession of reserve lands. The land was "purchased" from Henry and Lizzie Smith. Henry Smith is now quite old and ill. He made a video deposition in which he acknowledged the sale of the land to the plaintiff. The transfer was not properly registered in the Reserve Land Register, with the Department of Indian Affairs (now the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) and the plaintiff did not obtain a certificate of possession pursuant to s. 20(1) of the
Indian Act
.
[5]
In October, 1980, Simon Smith, the son of Henry and Lizzie Smith, tried to repurchase the land from the plaintiff. Money was paid to Simon Smith, from the Tsartlip Band Council Boat Ramp Account, to allow him to purchase the land. The cheque was signed by the then Chief, Tom Sampson, and by Phillip Paul. The plaintiff refused to sell. Simon Smith subsequently replaced Phillip Paul as a member of Council.
[6]
Two years later, on October 8, 1982, unbeknownst to the plaintiff, a document was signed purporting to transfer possession of the land to the Tsartlip Band. Henry Smith does not remember signing the transfer document. It is absolutely clear from his deposition, that he is sure he never sold the property to the Band or the Band Council. On November 5, 1982, the fraudulent transfer to the Band was approved by the Minister of Indian Affairs and recorded in the Reserve Land Register. The plaintiff did not find out about these transactions until the fall of 1984 when bulldozers moved onto his land.
[7]
On October 2, 1984, a Band Council Resolution requesting that the Minister of Indian Affairs authorize the use of the land "for school purposes for the general welfare of the Band under s. 18(2) of the
Indian Act
" was submitted to the Minister; that request was approved. (This was a redraft of an earlier Band Council Resolution of April 1984 which had advised the Minister that the land had been transferred by the Band Council to the Saanich Indian School Board.)
[8]
Discussions between the plaintiff and the various Band Council members ensued. He eventually came to the conclusion that, despite assurances that compensation would be paid to him, his claim was merely being put off and ignored by the Council. On July 28, 1988, the plaintiff commenced action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Some existing and previous Band Council members were named in their individual capacity as defendants. A statement of defence was filed by them. One of the paragraphs thereof asserts that "the issues involve land within an Indian Reserve which is wholly within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia has no jurisdiction to hear the matter". On September 28, 1990, the present action was commenced in this court.
Lack Of Reasonable Explanation
For Failure To Defend - Merits
Of The Defence
[9]
When counsel of record in the British Columbia Supreme Court action was approached to accept service of the statement of claim in the present action, he advised that he was not authorized to accept service of any documents. On January 12, 1991, a process server served the statement of claim personally on one of the individuals who had been a council member during the relevant period, Joe Bartleman. An attempt was made to serve Simon Smith and David Paul. They refused to accept the documentation and told the process server that since he was not a federal officer he was not allowed on the Tsartlip reserve. The process server asked the Chief of the Band for permission to go on the reserve to serve the various defendants. Permission was refused. The process server was told to get off the reserve. An order for substitutional service was obtained on September 19, 1991. The statement of claim was served pursuant to that order by leaving it at the Band office. The Band Council was served on March 6, 1992 by leaving a copy of the statement of claim with an employee of the Council. On July 8, 1992, a default judgment issued against the defendants.
[10]
Affidavits by Joseph Bartleman, Curtis Olsen, David Paul and Jim Jones were filed in support of the motion to set aside the default judgment. Jim Jones is the present manager of the Tsartlip Indian Band. The reasons asserted for the failure to defend the action can be characterized as: a lack of knowledge of the existence of the law suit; an understanding that someone else was looking after it; the subject was a matter with respect to which only the Minister of Indian Affairs had any authority; the plaintiff's claim, in the defendants' view, was without merit; there were no funds available to defend the law suit; the action was against individuals only and not against the Band Council.
[11]
Four affidavits were filed in response. One was filed by Emmanuel Cooper, the plaintiff's brother. He states that he was a Band Council member from October 30, 1989 to October 30, 1993. He states that during that time the issue of the plaintiff's claim to the property came up quite often at Council meetings: "[t]he Chief and Band Council knew very well about Arthur Cooper bringing an action both in the Supreme Court and in the Federal Court ... [i]n fact, jokes were made along the lines of, 'Here we go being sued again'." The affidavit continues: "It was generally acknowledged both by the Band Council and in the larger Tsartlip community that the subject property belonged to Arthur." Emmanuel Cooper states that "during the last term that I was a Councillor the attitude of the Band Council was that they had the right to expropriate property and that they felt that Arthur Cooper would not see his cases through."
[12]
An affidavit sworn by John Biggs states: "... it was common knowledge that Arthur Cooper and his son had cleared and owned the subject property. I had many conversations with Band members though I am unable to recall specifically names, dates and places, which left no doubt that there was a general knowledge of Arthur Cooper's ownership of the subject land."
[13]
A third affidavit sworn, by the individual who was the school administrator between 1975-1980 (of the old Tsartlip School) states that "[i]t was unquestionably known that this land belonged to Arthur Cooper." She explained that "[t]he school children would often have nature walks over the property upon which the new school now sits but before doing so teachers were directed by the principal of the old Tsartlip School to first obtain the permission of the plaintiff Arthur Cooper."
[14]
After consideration of all the evidence which has been filed, and particularly that which has been referred to above, I can not conclude that the defendants have given either a reasonable explanation as to why the claim was not defended earlier or that there is merit to their defence.
Jurisdictional Arguments
[15]
It is clear that this court has no jurisdiction to award damages as against the individual defendants in their personal capacity. Indeed, counsel for the plaintiff, after having the authorities called to his attention, essentially admitted this to be the case.
[16]
It also seems clear that there is no jurisdiction in this court to award damages against a nonfederal crown agent [see footnote 1]. The Band Council is not an agent of the Crown [see footnote 2] and therefore damages cannot be awarded in this court against it. I therefore reluctantly must set aside the award of damages found in the judgment.
[17]
To understand the other arguments which are made, it is first necessary to set out the claims in reference to which judgment was given. These were:
"The Plaintiff Claims As Follows:
(a) A Writ of Certiorari or relief in the nature thereof quashing the decision of the Minister of Indian Affairs approving the transfer [in] 1982 of 'Lot 3, Block 2' from Henry Smith and Simon Smith to the Band;
(b) A Writ of Certiorari or relief in the nature thereof to quash the decision of the Band Council on or about April, 1984 whereby the Council purported to set aside Lot 3, Block 2 for the local school authority;
(c) A Declaration that the plaintiff, Art Cooper is legally entitled to possession of Lot 3, Block 2, South Saanich Indian Reserve Number 1, shown on Plan 5096, Canada Land Surveys;
(d) Damages in an amount to be proven at trial;
(e) Costs;
(f) Such further and other relief as to this Honourable Court may seem meet and just."
[18]
Counsel for the defendants argues that insofar as paragraphs (a) and (c) of the relief claimed are concerned, the Minister of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development was never named as a party to these proceedings, and therefore, the relief described therein cannot be ordered. Insofar as paragraph (b) of the relief claimed is concerned, it is argued that the Band Council resolution of April 1984, never became operative. It was redrafted by officials of the (Ministry) Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and a revised version was passed by the Band Council in October of 1984 "requesting" that the Minister designate the land in question for school purposes.
[19]
First of all, it is clear that action against the defendant Band Council and the various members thereof, as this membership changed from time to time during the relevant period, is an action properly within the jurisdiction of this court. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).) Had the plaintiff chosen to also sue the Crown (by naming Her Majesty the Queen as a party) he would have had remedies available to him, additional to those which are obtainable from the present pleadings - damages can be awarded against the Crown. The fact that this was not done however does not, in my view, preclude judgment being given with respect to the claims which were made.
[20]
The arguments concerning paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), referred to above, raise a fundamental question: the defendants are raising many arguments and points which could certainly have been appropriate to pretrial proceedings but which are ill-suited to proceedings after a default judgment has been granted against them. For example, had the defendants raised, in the course of defending the action, the argument that the Minister had not been named as a party, the plaintiff could have considered whether an amendment to his statement of claim was necessary. Similarly, if the defendants had raised, in the course of pretrial or trial proceedings, the fact that the April 1984 council decision may not have become operative because it had been replaced by that of October 1984, the plaintiff would have amended his pleadings to also challenge the October decision. In my view, arguments which had they been raised in the context of a properly contested action, could have led the plaintiff to amend his pleadings to obtain the type of relief sought, but which would not have resulted in the court refusing to entertain the proceeding, does not relate to a lack of jurisdiction in the court so as to require the striking out of a default judgment. Thus, I am not persuaded that the defendants can resist judgment in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) on the basis that this court lacks jurisdiction with respect thereto.
[21]
I turn, then, to paragraph (a), which seeks certiorari against the decision of the Minister approving the transfer of the land to the Band. I note, first, that all the facts concerning the dispute are within the knowledge of those who have been named in the law suit and not the Minister. It is difficult to believe that the Minister's de facto involvement could add anything of substance to the proceedings. In addition, I am not convinced that the Minister was in fact a necessary party. There has been much jurisprudence respecting the appropriate role of quasi-judicial or administrative decision makers before the court when their decisions are under attack. In general, it is thought that it is only appropriate for them to take an active role in the proceedings when questions of their jurisdiction are involved. See, for example:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 449; 89 D.L.R.(3d) 161;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 437; 89 C.L.L.C. 14,050; [1989] 6 W.W.R. 673; 40 Admin. L.R. 181;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Admin. L.R.(2d) 2 (F.C.A.), discusses the
present
Federal Court Rules
under which it is
improper
to name the decision making body as a respondent party.
[22]
It is necessary to remember that the present case was commenced prior to the changes to the
Federal Court Act
brought about by S.C. 1990, c. 8, which came into force February 1, 1992. At the time, the present action was started, judicial review type proceedings could be commenced by statement of claim as well as by notice of motion. A claim for a declaratory judgment could however only be commenced by statement of claim. (See Sgayias, Kinnear, Rennie, Saunders,
Federal Court Practice 1990
, at 94.) Thus, the plaintiff's claim for a judicial review remedy (certiorari) was properly included in the statement of claim and his claim for a declaration could only have been obtained by that route.
[23]
There is no doubt that there are procedural questions, indeed procedural defects, in the action which was brought but I am not convinced that they are of a type which I should entertain in an application to set aside a default judgment. It may be that there will be difficulties in enforcing the judgment which is given because the plaintiff has not sued all the parties which he might properly have joined. I do not think this is a factor which I should take into account in deciding whether or not to set aside a default judgment. Also, whatever may be the defects, there is no doubt that none of these pertain to the remedy sought in paragraph (c): a declaration of possession in favour of the plaintiff.
[24]
I turn then to the judgment which was given and what modification thereto is required as a result of the above conclusions. Judgment was given in general terms. The order for default judgment reads:
1. Default Judgment is hereby granted.
2. Damages and Costs will be assessed on a date fixed by this court.
[25]
Damages were assessed by the prothonotary on the value of the land which was taken from the plaintiff, not for the loss of the use of the land contingent upon its repossession. Thus, while judgment was entered generally, the plaintiff pursued damages for loss of the property. As has been noted, this court does not have jurisdiction to grant damages against the Band Council or against the individual band council members.
[26]
Rule 439(3) of the
Federal Court Rules
provides that a default judgment may be set aside or varied:
"The court may, on such terms as seem just, set aside or vary any judgment given under rules 432 to 438."
[27]
In the circumstances, it is appropriate to vary the default judgment which issued on July 8, 1992, as follows:
1. Paragraph 1 of the order of July 8, 1992 is hereby amended to read:
Default judgment with respect to the relief claimed in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) of the plaintiff's statement of claim is granted.
2. Paragraph 2 of the order of July 18, 1992 is hereby rescinded.
[28]
It is clear from the reasons given above that the application pursuant to rule 419 becomes moot. If, however, I am wrong in varying the order of July 8, 1992 as set out above, I would not, in any event, be prepared to strike out the plaintiff's statement of claim. The more appropriate course of action would be to allow amendment to the statement of claim, to cure the procedural defects and to plead other relevant matters or remedies. Whatever extensions of time might be necessary to accommodate such course of action, of course, would also be granted.
[29]
The costs, including the costs of the now aborted reference on damages, awarded by Mr. Hargrave in his report of April 25, 1994, will be awarded to the plaintiff. Those costs were the direct result of the defendants' ostrich-like approach to this litigation.
[30]
Given the fact that success was divided, I make no order as to the costs of this application.
Order accordingly.
