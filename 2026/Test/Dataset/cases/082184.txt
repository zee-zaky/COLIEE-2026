INTRODUCTION
[1]
Heneghan, J.
: This application raises the narrow issue of whether an administrative SNDS, submitted pursuant to the policy concerning the change of a manufacturer's name, triggers the opportunity to list a patent pursuant to s. 4 of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, SOR/93-133 (the "
NOC Regulations
").
[2]
Astrazeneca Canada Inc. (the "Applicant") seeks judicial review of the decision of Ms. Anne Bowes, delegate of the Minister of Health (the "Minister") dated October 22, 2002. In that decision, the Minister refused to add Canadian Patent No. 2,186,037 (the "'037 patent") to the Patent Register relative to the LOSEC (omeprazole) delayed release capsule in the 40 mg dosage. The Applicant seeks an order quashing the decision and a further order in the nature of mandamus requiring the Minister to list the '037 patent.
BACKGROUND
[3]
The Applicant is a pharmaceutical manufacturer. On May 14, 2002, Ms. Karen Grandoni-Rocco, Manager, Regulatory Affairs, with the Applicant, wrote to Mrs. Marilyn Schwartz, Submissions and Information Policy Division, Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada, and requested that the '037 patent be listed on the Patent Register for several pharmaceutical products, including LOSEC capsules in the 40 mg dosage.
[4]
The Applicant submitted the required Patent Form IV, pursuant to the
NOC Regulations
, s. 4 and referenced, for the LOSEC 40 mg capsules, the previously filed Submission 067991. According to the Applicant, this Submission was filed on July 12, 2000 as a Supplemental New Drug Submission ("SNDS") for a company name change as the result of a merger between Astra Pharma Inc. and Zeneca Pharma Inc. that took effect on January 1, 2000. The Patent Form IV stated that the '037 patent was filed on January 9, 1996 and was granted on April 16, 2002, with an expiry date of February 9, 1996.
[5]
By letter dated June 12, 2002, Ms. Anne Bowes, Senior Patent Officer-Science, Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison with Health Canada, advised the Applicant that, following review of the submitted patent list, it was found to be ineligible for listing on the Patent Register. The letter addressed the ineligibility for listing relative to the 10 mg and 20 mg capsules as well; the issues with respect to those products have been resolved and the only remaining issue relates to the 40 mg capsules.
[6]
Ms. Bowes advised that the submission referenced in the Patent Form IV for the 40 mg capsules was for a change in the manufacturer's name pursuant to the
Changes in Manufacturer's Name and/or Patent Name
published in April 1998, and said that such Submission is not sufficient to permit the listing of a patent. She put this position in the following terms:
"... The
Changes in Manufacturer's Name
policy requires that all aspects of the drug product, including the conditions of manufacture and sale, must be identical to those previously authorized, except for the change in either manufacturer or brand name. The addition of a patent on the basis of a NOC for a name change is contrary to the scheme of s. 4, which provides for the addition of a patent to be made within the strict time-requirements reflected in s. 4(3), 4(4) and 4(6) of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
; see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2002), Court File No. A-44-01 (F.C.A.).
"It is our position that the addition of a patent on the basis of a notice of compliance for a name change is contrary to the scheme provided for in s. 4. Section 4(3), 4(4) and 4(6) provide for the addition of a patent to be made within strict time-requirements.
"Pursuant to the authority vested in the Minister of Health by s. 3(1) of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the '037 patent will not be added to the Patent Register, subject to any written representations, as the '037 patent is not relevant to the drug outlined in the submission for NOC."
[7]
The Applicant availed of the opportunity to make further submissions and did so in a letter, dated July 8, 2002, from its lawyers. Counsel for the Applicant argued that Ms. Bowes, as the Minister's delegate, had misinterpreted both the
NOC Regulations
and prevailing jurisprudence in denying the request to list the '037 patent.
[8]
By letter dated October 22, 2002, Ms. Bowes confirmed the Minister's decision and said as follows:
"Further, with respect only to submission # 067991, the TPD maintains that, being a submission filed for a change in manufacturer name, the submission does not afford Astra a valid opportunity to file a patent list. The decision in Eli Lilly has no bearing on this matter and our position on this point should be considered final."
[9]
On November 21, 2002, the Applicant commenced this proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision. It filed the affidavit of Jacinta M. De Abreu in support of its application. That affidavit identifies and attaches, as exhibits, the following documents:
A. A certified copy of the '037 patent;
B. Copy of the letter dated May 14, 2002 from the Applicant to the Therapeutic Products Directorate, with enclosures;
C. Copy of the letter dated June 12, 2002 from Ms. Bowes, on behalf of Health Canada, to the Applicant;
D. Copy of confidential letter dated July 8, 2002 from Smart & Biggar, Solicitors for the Applicant, to Ms. Bowes;
E. Copy of letter dated October 22, 2002 from Ms. Bowes;
F. Copy of the Notice of Application for Judicial Review issued on November 21, 2002.
[10]
In response, the Minister filed the affidavit of Ms. Bowes. The following documents are attached as exhibits to that affidavit:
A. Copy of the '037 patent;
B. Copy of the Therapeutic Products Directorate Policy
Changes in Manufacturer's Name and/or Patent Name
;
C. Copy of letter dated October 21, 1999 from Astrazeneca Canada Inc. to Submission and Information Policy Division, Bureau of Policy & Coordination;
D. Copy of Notice of Compliance dated October 24, 2000 issued to Astrazeneca for LOSEC capsules, including the 40 mg capsule, Drug Identification Number ("DIN"), 02016788;
E. Copies of Form IV: Patent Lists for several products, including LOSEC delayed release capsule 40 mg, dated May 14, 2002;
F. Copy of letter dated June 12, 2002 from Health Canada to the Applicant;
G. Copy of confidential letter dated July 8, 2002, from Smart & Biggar, Solicitors for the Applicant, to Health Canada;
H. Copy of letter dated October 22, 2002 from Health Canada to the solicitors for the Applicant.
[11]
A Direction was issued on May 7, 2004, subsequent to the hearing of this application advising that it appeared that the documents submitted as Exhibit C to the affidavit of Ms. Bowes had been attached in error. By letter dated May 10,2004, counsel submitted the following documents which shall be treated as a supplement to Exhibit C, as follows:
i) copy of letter dated July 12, 2000 from AstraZeneca to Mrs. Marilyn Schwartz, Acting Manager, Submission and Information Policy Division, Bureau of Policy and Coordination;
ii) copy of the Certification Form filed by AstraZeneca entitled "Therapeutic Products Programme, Changes in Manufacturer's Name and/or Product Name, Administration Changes Certification Form".
SUBMISSIONS
i) The Applicant
[12]
The Applicant argues that it has met the timing requirements, pursuant to the
NOC Regulations
to allow it to have the '037 patent listed on the Patent Register. The '037 patent issued on April 16, 2002. At that time, the Applicant had filed a SNDS for which a Notice of Compliance ("NOC") had been issued on October 24, 2000. The Applicant submitted its patent list on May 14, 2002, that is within thirty days of the issuance of the '037 patent for which application had been made on February 9, 1996. The application date for the patent pre-dated the Applicant's SNDS in July 2000.
[13]
Relying on the recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 320 N.R. 37; 2004 FCA 154, the Applicant submits that having met the timing requirements set out in s. 4 of the
NOC Regulations
and in the absence of any evidence that it is trying to circumvent the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court should not look at the substance of its SNDS but direct the Minister to list the '037 patent.
[14]
The Applicant argues that the factual situation in this case is distinguishable from the facts at play in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 318 (T.D.), affd. (2002), 288 N.R. 24; 16 C.P.R.(4th) 425 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 155 (F.C.A.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 232 (T.D.).
ii) The Minister
[15]
The Respondent takes the position that, having regard to the regulatory framework set out in the
NOC Regulations
, an administrative SNDS cannot give rise to an opportunity to list a patent on the Patent Register. According to the Minister, the earlier decisions in
Bristol-Myers  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
Feering
, supra and
Toba  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , apply to the present case. The recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, does not change the basic principle that a person seeking to add a patent to the Patent Register must comply with the strict time-lines set out in the
NOC Regulations
.
ANALYSIS AND DISPOSITION
[16]
This requires consideration of the applicable regulatory regime which includes reference to the
Food and Drug Regulations
, C.R.C. 870, as amended (the "
Food and Drug Regulations
"). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, the Federal Court of Appeal described that regime as follows:
"5. If an NDS has already been filed and the manufacturer subsequently makes changes to its drug such that the information contained in the NDS is now significantly different in respect of certain specified matters, a manufacturer must make a Supplemental New Drug Submission (SNDS) in respect of its product. The Minister's approval of an SNDS is also indicated by an NOC.
"6. Submitting either an NDS or an SNDS, and obtaining an NOC, grants an administrative remedy to protect a manufacturer's pre-existing patent rights. Specifically, if the timing requirements in s. 4 of the
PM(NOC) Regulations
are met, the manufacturer can file patent lists with the Minister. Listing an eligible patent gives the patent holder an opportunity to invoke the
PM(NOC) Regulations
that will shield the manufacturer's product against generic competition for a statutorily-specified period of time, as the
PM(NOC) Regulations
stipulate that a generic drug manufacturer cannot obtain an NOC for its product without proving that its product does not infringe a listed pharmaceutical patent.
"7. As the preceding summary sets out, both of these regulatory regimes touch Canadian patented pharmaceutical products. The
Food and Drug Regulations
are concerned with the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. The
PM(NOC) Regulations
balance the rights of holders of pharmaceutical patents and generic drug manufacturers. This second regulatory regime is driven by concerns relating to intellectual property and the appropriate scope of protection that it should be afforded. However, the
Food and Drug Regulations
and the
PM(NOC) Regulations
are connected. Compliance with the former is required to obtain concomitant patent benefits under the latter regime."

b) les brevets mentionnés dans la liste ou dans la modification sont admissibles à l'inscription au registre et sont pertinents quant à la forme posologique, la concentration et la voie d'administration de la drogue visée par la demande d'avis de conformité."
[19]
As appears from the foregoing extract from the
Food and Drug Regulations
, a NOC is to be obtained after a submission is made to the Minister. There are various types of submissions, that is a "new drug submission" pursuant to s. C.08.002 (1)(a), an "abbreviated new drug submission" pursuant to s. C.08.002.1 (1), and a "Supplement" to either a new drug submission or abbreviated drug submission pursuant to s. C.08.003 (1)(a). The matters to be addressed in respect of these types of submissions include reference to the brand name and proper or common name of the new drug; see ss. C.08.002.2 (6), C.008.002.1 (2)(a) and C.08.003 (2)(b). The
Food and Drug Regulations
do not require that any particular information is to be provided about the manufacturer's name or a change in the manufacturer's name.
[20]
The
Food and Drug Regulations
require a manufacturer to submit a new submission when there has been a significant change in respect of any of the matters identified in s. C.08.03 (2), including the description of the new drug, its brand name or identifying name or code, and the specifications of its ingredients.
[21]
The definition of "notice of compliance" in the
NOC Regulations
incorporates the definition in the
Food and Drug Regulations
. It has been established that, for the purposes of the
NOC Regulations
, a "Submission for a notice of compliance" is a new drug submission, an abbreviated new drug submission, and a supplement to either of them. In this regard, I refer to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 271 (T.D.), at p. 287 [C.P.R.], where Justice McGillis said as follows:
"In considering the expression 'a submission for a notice of compliance' in ss. 4 and 5 of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, the mechanisms which trigger the issuance of a notice of compliance are, by virtue of the definition of 'notice of compliance' in s. 2, those specified in s. C.08.004 of the
Food and Drug Regulations
, namely a new drug submission, an abbreviated new drug submission and a supplement to a new drug submission or to an abbreviated new drug submission. In the circumstances, the expression 'submission for a notice of compliance', as used in ss. 4 and 5 of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
means a new drug submission, an abbreviated new drug submission and a supplement to a new drug submission or to an abbreviated new drug submission."
[22]
However, the question here is whether a NOC issued in response to something other than a NDS, ANDS or SNDS allows the holder of that NOC to submit a patent list pursuant to s. 4(4) of the
NOC Regulations
. This question requires consideration of the purpose of the
NOC Regulations
and the consequences of listing a patent on the Patent Register.
[23]
The
NOC Regulations
are subordinate legislation and stand to be interpreted on their own terms. However, the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement ("RIAS") that accompanied the 1998 amendments to the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> may serve as a guide to Parliamentary intention as to the purpose and effect of those <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , although it is not part of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 293 (F.C.A.), at 296 [C.P.R.].
[24]
In
Bristol-Myers  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pages 324 - 325 [C.P.R.] the trial judge referred to the RIAS for the 1998 amendments of the
NOC Regulations
. In part, the RIAS says as follows:
"The link between the patent status of a drug and approval for a generic version of the drug is being maintained, to provide effective enforcement of patent rights, while at the same time ensuring that generic drugs can enter the market as soon as possible; either as soon as it is determined that they are not covered by a patent, or, where they are covered by a patent, immediately after the expiry of the patent. Overall, since the amendments are designed to make the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> fairer and more effective, and reduce unnecessary litigation, compliance costs to private sector parties should be reduced. The amendments will not significantly alter the costs of administering, or adjudicating cases under the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
"The amendments reinforce the balance between providing a mechanism for the effective enforcement of patent rights and ensuring that generic drug products enter the market as soon as possible."
[25]
The effect of adding a patent to the Patent Register is to provide the person submitting that patent access to the prohibition proceedings, to prevent the issuance of a NOC to another manufacturer with the result that a competitor will be delayed entry into the market. In this regard, I refer again to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, paragraph 6, quoted earlier in these reasons.
[26]
The effect of the commencement of prohibition proceedings pursuant to the
NOC Regulations
, is to grant a statutory stay of up to twenty-four months, a situation that has been described as "draconian" by the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[27]
According to the evidence submitted, the Applicant here filed a submission to the Minister relative only to the change of its name, in accordance with a policy concerning change of manufacturer's name. That is characterized by the Minister as an administrative submission. The submission does not relate to any change in the composition of the drug or of any of its constituent components. The certification form submitted by the Applicant on July 12, 2003, referred to above, contains the following information:
"We certify that all aspects of the submission pertaining to:
Losec Capsules 10 mg, 20 mg & 40 mg
submitted by:
AstraZeneca Canada Inc.
are identical to the
Losec Capsules, Astra Pharma Inc.
10 mg: DIN 02119579
20 mg: DIN 00846503
40 mg: DIN 02016788
submission except for a change in the manufacturer/sponsor's name and/or product name and that the product will be manufactured in the same location with identical specifications and procedures."
[28]
There was no debate about the relationship of the '037 patent to the Applicant's pharmaceutical products. The lack of an opportunity for comparison to the drug to which it relates was remarked upon in
Toba Pharma Inc.
, supra where the Court concluded that the patent list there in issue could not be registered.
[29]
The SNDS here in issue does not address a different indication for the Applicant's pharmaceutical product. I refer again to the recent decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, where the Federal Court of Appeal said the following at paragraph 25:
"Although not defined in the
Food and Drug Regulations
, an indication is essentially the purpose for which a pharmaceutical product is used (see e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 273). For the purposes of filing an SNDS, an indication does not have to be new or novel, in the sense that this term is used in patent law. However, if a manufacturer proposes to use its pharmaceutical product for a purpose for which it has no prior approval, an SNDS is required. This is what occurred in the present matter. Thus, the Motions Judge was correct in stating that the SNDS related to the eradication of H. pylori and that Abbott had no prior authorization to sell or market the specific combination of Biaxin (clarithromycin), amoxicillin and lansoprazole to combat H. pylori infection. The fact that TAP had previously obtained approval for this combination is immaterial, as TAP is a different manufacturer."
[30]
The Court here found that there was a new indication and distinguished the earlier decisions in
Bristol-Myers  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra at paragraphs 27 and 28, and characterized those cases as being "examples of manifest attempts to list patents after the time limitations set out in s. 4 of the
PM(NOC) Regulations
had expired".
[31]
As appears from the text of s. 4, quoted above, a patent list can be submitted either at the time that a person files a submission for a notice of compliance (s. 4(3)) or within 30 days after the issuance of a patent that was issued on the basis of an application that has a filing date that predates the date of filing the submission (s. 4(4)). The Applicant claims to meet the requirements of s. 4(4) and says that it is entitled to have its patent list included on the patent register.
[32]
In effect, the Applicant says that as long as there is a submission for a NOC on the record when a patent is issued, for which an application was made prior to the filing date of that submission, that the patent is eligible for inclusion on the patent register without assessment of the underlying submission. In my opinion, this argument is flawed because it overlooks the Minister's discretion to accept a patent list and second, it depends upon a literal, mechanical view of the
NOC Regulations
.
[33]
It is well established that the Minister has complete discretion to accept or reject a patent list, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 1 (F.C.A.). Time-lines for submitting the patent list is a critical factor in making that decision, as illustrated by the decisions in
Bristol-Myers  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
Toba  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.
[34]
As well, the purpose of the
NOC Regulations
, according to the RIAS, is to balance the "effective enforcement of patent rights" and the earliest possible entry of generic drugs into the market, after the issuance of a NOC. This is consistent with the purpose of s. 42 of the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-5, as amended, that is to protect the exclusive rights of a patentee. Section 55.2(4) authorizes the Governor-in-Council to enact such regulations as are "necessary for preventing the infringement of a patent ... in accordance with subsection (1)". Section 55.2(1) of the
Patent Act
, supra provides as follows:
"55.2(1) It is not an infringement of a patent for any person to make, construct, use or sell the patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information required under any law of Canada, a province or a country other than Canada that regulates the manufacture, construction, use or sale of any product."
"55.2(1) Il n'y a pas contrefaçon de brevet lorsque l'utilisation, la fabrication, la construction ou la vente d'une invention brevetée se justifie dans la seule mesure nécessaire à la préparation et à la production du dossier d'information qu'oblige à fournir une loi fédérale, provinciale ou étrangère réglementant la fabrication, la construction, l'utilisation ou la vente d'un produit."
[35]
Section 55.2(1) grants protection to a person who uses a patented invention for the limited purposes spelled out in that provision. By extension, the inclusion of a patent list on the patent register grants further protection to a person like the Applicant, that is access to the prohibition proceedings contemplated by s. 6. The definition of "first person" in s. 2 of the
NOC Regulations
refers to the holder of a patent list pursuant to s. 4(1), as follows:
"'first person' means the person referred to in subsection 4(1);
"4(1) A person who files or has filed a submission for, or has been issued, a notice of compliance in respect of a drug that contains a medicine may submit to the Minister a patent list certified in accordance with subsection (7) in respect of the drug."
"'première personne' La personne visée au paragraphe 4(1).
"4(1) La personne qui dépose ou a déposé une demande d'avis de conformité pour une drogue contenant un médicament ou qui a obtenu un tel avis peut soumettre au ministre une liste de brevets à l'égard de la drogue, accompagnée de l'attestation visée au paragraphe (7)."
[36]
Again, I refer to
Merck Frosst Canada
, supra, where Justice Iacobucci described the effect of commencing a prohibition proceeding, at p. 214  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , as follows:
"... The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> provide for what is, in effect, a statutory prohibition on, or injunction against, the granting of a NOC, commencing immediately upon the filing by a 'first person' of an application for a court-imposed prohibition order and concluding only upon the earlier of the judicial determination of the application or the passage of 30 months. This prohibition takes effect automatically, without any consideration of the merits of the application; not even the ordinary requirements for an interlocutory injunction must be complied with. Under these conditions, and absent some prior indication to the contrary, I think it would be permissible for a generic producer to predict that either the patentee, the holder of a prior NOC, or both, is likely to attempt to protect or prolong their as-yet exclusive rights for as long as possible by taking advantage of the procedure set out in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."
[37]
The operation of the
NOC Regulations
is connected with the assessment of the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, pursuant to the
Food and Drug Regulations
. It is reasonable to conclude that the underlying submission for a patent list be related to the purpose of that regulatory scheme. In the present case, that relationship is not apparent. The underlying submission is only for an administrative change in the record of the manufacturer's name.
[38]
In
Toba  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court dealt with a similar situation where the applicant sought to ground an application for a patent list upon a SNDS that related to a change of the manufacturer's name and product name. The patentee had failed to submit the patent list within thirty days after its issuance. At pages 237-238 [C.P.R.], the Court said as follows:
"In addition, an SNDS cannot be considered an appropriate opportunity to file a patent list. The purpose here was solely to indicate a change in the manufacturer's name and product name. The filing of a patent list on the basis of a NOC for a change in the manufacturer's name and product name in accordance with the policy on Changes in Manufacturer's Name and/or Product Name (referred to in the letter dated December 18, 2001) is contrary to the scheme of s. 4, which provides only for the addition of a patent to be made within the time requirements reflected in s-ss. 4(3), 4(4) and 4(6) of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."
[39]
The Applicant has not shown why the decision in
Toba  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  should not apply in the present case. The letter dated July 12, 2000 from the Applicant to Mrs. Schwartz, referred to above, clearly describes the submission as "an administrative New Drug Submission for the purpose of changing the company ownership of DINs and updating the product labelling with the
new company name
". (Emphasis added) The Minister found this submission to be insufficient for the purpose of accepting the patent list submitted by the Applicant.
[40]
The Minister's decision, involving an issue of interpretation of the
NOC Regulations
, is reviewable on the standard of correctness; see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), sub nom
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  list the '037 patent and the application is dismissed, with costs to the Minister.
ORDER
[41]
The application is dismissed, with costs to the Minister.
Application dismissed.
