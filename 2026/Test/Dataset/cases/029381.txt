Jerome, A.C.J.
: This is an application by Softkey Software Products Inc. for an order pursuant to rule 330 of the
Federal Court Rules
to set aside and to vary positions of the ex parte order for production of documents and written returns issued by this court on June 28, 1994.
[2]
Softkey Software Products Inc. is a corporation which, among other things, develops and sells tax preparation software. On June 10, 1994, the Director of Investigation and Research ordered an inquiry into ceratin of the company's activities, pursuant to s. 10(1)(b)(ii) of the
Competition Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34. An ex parte application was made to this court by the Director on June 23, 1994, for an order for the production of documents and written returns pursuant to s. 11(1)(b) and 11(1)(c) of the
Act
. On June 28, 1994, Mr. Justice Denault granted the order.
[3]
Softkey now seeks to have that order rescinded or varied on the grounds it requires the company to produce documents which are irrelevant to the inquiry and which go beyond its scope.
[4]
I am not prepared to grant the application. A judge will only undertake to rescind or vary another judge's ex parte order under special or unique circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Man.R.(2d) 194; [1984] 1 W.W.R. 481; 9 C.C.C.(3d) 97; 37 C.R.(3d) 97; 4 D.L.R.(4th) 577, the Supreme Court of Canada stated at pp. 123-124:
"In civil matters, there is a body of jurisprudence which deals with the review of ex parte orders. There is a widely recognized rule that an ex parte order may be reviewed by the judge who made it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  an ex parte order, it was quite competent for him to rescind that order, on this being shown to him that it ought not to have been granted, and when rescinded it was as if it had never been granted. ...'
"This view is reflected in the words of Mathers, C.J.K.B., in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 945, [1924] 2 W.W.R. 1103 (Man. K.B.);
'But it frequently happens that judges and judicial officers are called upon to make orders ex parte, where only one side is represented and where the order granted is not the result of a deliberate judicial decision after a hearing and argument. An application to rescind or vary an ex parte order is neither an appeal nor an application in the nature of an appeal and therefore the judge or officer by whom such an order has been made, has since the
Judicature Act
, as he had before, the right to rescind or vary it ...'
. . . . .
"The exigencies of court administration, as well as death or illness of the authorizing judge, do not always make it practical or possible to apply for a review to the same judge who made the order. There is support for the proposition that another judge of the same court can review an ex parte order ... In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 626-627, 28 W.W.R. 517 (B.C.C.A.), Smith, J.A., said:
'After considering the cases, which are neither as conclusive nor as consistent as they might be, I am of the opinion that the weight of authority supports the following propositions as to one judge's dealings with another judge's ex parte order: (1) He has power to discharge the order or dissolve the injunction; (2) he ought not to exercise this power, but ought to refer the motion to the first judge, except in special circumstances, e.g., where he acts by consent or by leave of the first judge, or where the first judge is not available to hear the motion; (3) if the second judge hears the motion, he should hear it de novo as to both the law and fact involved.'"
[5]
Furthermore, unless the party seeking to rescind or vary the ex parte order can establish it was made on the basis of misleading, incomplete, or incorrect facts, there is nothing to warrant the interference of another judge. This was also clearly established by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Wilson
, at p. 124:
"
The reviewing judge must not substitute his discretion for that of the authorizing judge
. Only if the facts upon which the authorization was granted are found to be different from the facts proved on the ex parte review should the authorization be disturbed." (emphasis added)
[6]
After considering the submissions made by counsel in the present case, I am unable to conclude there are pertinent facts or information which were not before Denault, J., at the time he made the ex parte order in question. Accordingly, any variation or recision of that order by another judge would be improper.
[7]
For these reasons the application is dismissed. Softkey Software Products Inc. is granted sixty days within which to comply with the ex parte order. Costs in the cause.
Application dismissed.
