Teitelbaum, J.
: This is an application by the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited for an order rescinding or setting aside the ex parte order of Mr. Justice Rouleau extending the time for service of the statement of claim and for leave to serve a notice of the statement of claim ex juris upon defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited and the purported service thereunder.
[2]
The application by the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited is made in virtue of Rules 304, 306, 307, 308 and 309 of the Federal Court of Canada.
[3]
All of the above rules deal with the validity and service of documents. Rule 304 speaks of the service of originating documents, Rule 306, the delay within which the service should be effected, Rule 307 deals with service ex juris, Rule 308 deals with the service of documents generally and Rule 309 with personal service.
[4]
At the hearing before me in Montreal, the attorney for defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited, touching on all of the above rules, restricted most of his argument to the question of the extension of time granted to the plaintiffs by Mr. Justice Rouleau in his ex parte judgment of November 19, 1985 extending, in virtue of Rule 306, the time to serve the statement of claim.
[5]
Rule 306 of the Federal Court of Canada states:
"A statement of claim or declaration
may be served
under Rule 304
within 12 months from the day
when the
statement of claim or declaration was filed
, but where,
for any sufficient reason
, a statement of claim or declaration has not been served within that time, the court may, by order, made either before or after the expiration of such time,
extend the time for service
for a period not exceeding 12 months at any one time, each of such extensions to be calculated from the date of the order." (underlining is mine)
[6]
At first glance, it would seem obvious that what is being attempted by this rule is to prevent a plaintiff who has instituted legal proceedings by filing a statement of claim in the office of the court from losing its rights because it failed to serve the statement of claim within the delay of 12 months. The only obligation placed on the plaintiff from automatically being granted an extension of time is that the plaintiff must show the court "any sufficient reason".
[7]
I place some importance on the word "any" as this indicates only one "sufficient reason" is required to grant a plaintiff an extension of time to serve a statement of claim beyond the 12 month delay period.
[8]
The word "any" is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, as "one out of many" or "one in some". Therefore, if a plaintiff can show only one sufficient reason, then the court has the obligation to grant a request for an extension of time to serve.
[9]
An ex parte hearing on the request for the extension of time to serve took place in Toronto on November 18, 1985. On November 19, 1985, Mr. Justice Rouleau ordered the extension of time for service of the statement of claim extending the delay to January 16, 1986 basing himself "Upon hearing counsel for the plaintiffs on November 18, 1985 and upon having read the affidavits of Nigel Harvey Hugh Frawley, sworn on the 1st and 19th days of November, 1985".
[10]
The first question to be determined by myself is whether I can set aside the order of Mr. Justice Rouleau. I am of the view that I can, if, after a full hearing at which the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited or his representative is present, I come to the conclusion that there did not exist a single sufficient reason to have granted the extension.
[11]
The above principle was clearly enunciated by Jackett, C.J., in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 404 and 405.
"Generally speaking, when a court makes an order or delivers a judgment, in the absence of special provision, it is without authority to review such order or judgment. Its correctness can only be dealt with on appeal. When, however, an order is made ex parte, in my view, in the absence of something to the contrary, there is an inherent jurisdiction in the court, after the party adversely affected has been given an opportunity to be heard, if it then appears that the ex parte order or judgment should not have been made,
(a) to set aside the ex parte order or judgment as of the time when the order setting aside is made, and
(b) to make such ancillary order as may be necessary to restore the party adversely affected to the position he would have been in if the ex parte order or judgment had not been made."
[12]
I am satisfied that the hearing before me to review an ex parte order granting an extension of time for service of a statement of claim or for the granting of an order for service ex juris is an entirely new hearing and is, in effect, a hearing de novo.
[13]
I agree with the statement made by Sidney Smith, J.A., in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C.A.), at 630 and 631 where he states:
"Once a judge has for examination another judge's ex parte order, I think there should be no restriction on the scope of the hearing, it should be one de novo."
[14]
Although Mr. Justice Smith was speaking as an appeal judge in the British Columbia Court of Appeal, I cannot find any reason why the Federal Court of Canada should follow a different course.
[15]
The attorney for defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited, in discussing the question of ex juris service, argued that this is an exception to the general rule and as such there must be full and complete disclosure of all the facts to the judge who is being asked to issue a service ex juris order.
[16]
The attorney for defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited cites a number of cases to show that his view is well taken.
[17]
In The Hagen Case (1908), 11 A.S.P. 66, at 69 Farwell, L.J., states:
"... and the conclusion to which the authorities led us I may put under three heads. I think my memory is accurate. First of all, the Lord Justice adopted, and I agreed with him, the statement of Pearson, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  again, that, 'it becomes a very serious question, and ought always to be considered a very serious question, whether or not, even in a case like that, it is necessary for the jurisdiction of the court to be invoked, and whether this court ought to put a foreigner, who owes no allegiance here, to the inconvenience and annoyance of being brought to contest his rights in this country, and I for one say, most distinctly, that I think this court ought to be exceedingly careful before it allows a writ to be served out of the jurisdiction'.
"The second point which I think we considered established by the cases was this, that, if on the construction of any of the sub-heads of Order XI, there was any doubt, it ought to be resolved in favour of the foreigners; and the third is that, inasmuch as the application was made ex parte, the fullest disclosure was necessary, as in all ex parte applications, and a failure to make a full disclosure would justify the court in actually discharging the order, even although the party might afterwards be in a position to make another application."
[18]
The above principles were followed in a number of other cases, as quoted to me by the attorney for the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited. They are:
The Brabo, [1949] A.C. 326
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  service outside the jurisdiction and forcing such a defendant to appear in, for it, a foreign court is and should be an exception to the general rule.
[20]
In the present case, the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited is a foreign defendant having its office in Liberia. This being the case, I also believe, that there should be a full and complete disclosure of all the material facts upon which a judge would render an order for service ex juris.
[21]
The attorney for the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited admitted during his argument that a judge of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, has the jurisdiction to extend the delay of service of a statement of claim and can grant leave to serve outside of the jurisdiction but that the party applying must disclose all material facts.
[22]
Insofar as I believe, material facts means all relevant facts, not all facts nor necessarily, facts that the defendant has full and complete knowledge of.
[23]
The attorney for the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited states that there was no full and frank disclosure by plaintiffs because no mention was made nor any documents produced with the affidavits of Nigel Harvey Hugh Frawley of November 1, 1985 and November 19, 1985. The defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited's attorney lists three points:
a) No surveyor's report was filed with the affidavit;
b) The Charter Party Document was only filed after the ex parte hearing;
c) The fact that arbitration was requested by plaintiffs and that plaintiffs made no mention of this.
[24]
I am satisfied that the affidavits of Mr. Frawley disclosed sufficient material or relevant facts to have allowed Mr. Justice Rouleau to have issued an order permitting the ex juris service. The fact that the surveyor's report was not filed or that the Charter Party Document was filed late or that the question of arbitration was not mentioned is, in my view, not sufficient for me to conclude that there was not a full and complete disclosure.
[25]
Full and complete disclosure is, in my opinion, the filing of an affidavit giving the important facts as to why a service ex juris is to be allowed.
[26]
The question of arbitration or the late filing of the Charter Party Document or of the failure to file the surveyor's report are not, in my view, material facts as to conclude for the setting aside of the order given by Mr. Justice Rouleau.
[27]
All of the above facts were in the knowledge of the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited. At the discharge of the cargo a marine surveyor appointed by the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited was present. This is admitted by the said defendant's attorney who informed me that he was the one to have appointed the surveyor. The defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited was a party to the Charter Party Contract and thus it surely had knowledge of it. With regard to plaintiffs' surveyor's report, I agree with plaintiffs' attorney and state that this report is a privileged report and remains so unless the privilege is waived.
[28]
The most important problem in this particular case is to see if there existed, at the time of the ex parte order or at the present time, one reason that can be considered as "sufficient" to grant the extension of time for service.
[29]
In attempting to convince me that plaintiffs had sufficient reason, plaintiffs' attorney had to rely on the affidavit of Robert J. Williams, an attorney of the City of New York, State of New York, one of the United States of America.
[30]
After a reading of the affidavit and the supporting documents attached to the affidavit, I am able to only find one reason why the statement of claim had not been served within the delays established by the rules of the Federal Court.
[31]
The more important paragraphs of the affidavit of Mr. Robert J. Williams would be paragraphs 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17.
[32]
These paragraphs basically tell me that Mr. Williams was informed by the attorney of plaintiff, Duval Sales Corporation, that instructions were given to a firm of Canadian attorneys to commence in personam and in rem proceedings in the Federal Court of Canada against persons believed responsible for the damage to the cargo of plaintiff Duval Sales Corporation and to obtain a letter of undertaking from the owners of the ship "Ioannis" or their insurers to furnish security in respect to the action in rem.
[33]
From this, I can believe that it is possible that instructions were given to commence legal proceedings against the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited.
[34]
I also believe (paragraph 6) that Blue Anchor Lines Limited or its representative engaged a marine surveyor and subsequently arbitration proceedings were commenced with the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited (paragraph 8).
[35]
In paragraph 9 of his affidavit, Mr. Williams states that on November 27, 1984 he received a telephone call from a Tom Ostensen, defendant Blue Anchor's representative (Marine Defense Group Ltd.) who informed Mr. Williams that Blue Anchor Lines Limited had been advised that the owner of the ship had given an undertaking to appear, defend and post security in a pending Federal Court of Canada action and that Mr. Ostensen was aware of the cause of the loss. Mr. Williams also states that he advised Mr. Ostensen that the claim in Canada in the Federal Court was proceeding against the ship owners and Blue Anchor Lines Limited.
[36]
With regard to the arbitration, Mr. Williams states he informed Mr. Ostensen that Blue Anchor Lines Limited would not be required to appoint an arbitrator unless further advised.
[37]
Mr. Williams, in paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the affidavit states that because Mr. Ostensen did not state that Blue Anchor Lines Limited would object "to its joinder in the Federal Court of Canada proceedings" and because of a letter dated December 3, 1984 from Mr. Ostensen confirming the telephone conversation whereby Blue Anchor Lines Limited would not be required to appoint an arbitrator he was of the belief that he could commence settlement negotiations with the ship owner and, here I assume, there would be no need to serve the statement of claim on the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited.
[38]
The other paragraphs simply state that negotiations were commenced with the other defendants in the action and that no settlement could be reached.
[39]
Mr. Ostensen, in his affidavit, confirms that he had a telephone conversation with Mr. Williams, that it was agreed that no arbitrator would have to be appointed by Blue Anchor Lines Limited and that he was informed that an action had been instituted in the Federal Court of Canada against the ship "Ioannis" and its owners.
[40]
Mr. Ostensen denies ever being told that one of the defendants in the Canadian proceedings was Blue Anchor Lines Limited or that he was requested to accept service of any Canadian proceedings against the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited.
[41]
The case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  settlement with someone other than the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited is not a "sufficient" reason to extend delay of service.
[42]
Jackett, P., as he then was, stated at page 762:
"I have expressed the view before, and I remain to be convinced that it is wrong, that there is no justification for issuing a writ and leaving it lie without service on a defendant while negotiating with someone else. The rules of law contemplate, and the justice of the matter requires, that when an action is commenced, the appropriate papers be communicated to the defendants. The law is designed to put some limit on the length of time that can be allowed to elapse before facing a person with a lawsuit."
[43]
In the present case, I am of the belief that the fact that plaintiffs were negotiating with other defendants to the action is not a sufficient reason to extend the delays for service. I agree with Jackett, P., when he states that a writ should be served as soon as possible and within the delays fixed by law. Allowing an extension of the delay to serve a statement of claim should be the exception and should not be easily granted.
[44]
In the unreported case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  negotiations with the defendant is not always considered a sufficient reason and in this case did not allow an ex parte request for an extension of time to serve.
[45]
Plaintiffs' attorney states that one very good and sufficient reason for dismissing the motion before me is that, in the circumstances of the case, the plaintiffs were induced by the conduct of Mr. Ostensen.
[46]
Unfortunately for plaintiffs, I cannot agree with this contention. After examining both the affidavit of Mr. Williams and Mr. Ostensen, I cannot find any allegation by Mr. Ostensen whereby Mr. Williams was misled into error.
[47]
I am satisfied that even if Mr. Ostensen knew that an action had been brought against Blue Anchor Lines Limited, which he denies, this in itself does not mean that Mr. Ostensen induced plaintiffs' representative to believe that the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited was ready to accept service or be part of an action as a defendant.
[48]
Mr. Williams states in paragraph 10 of his affidavit that Mr. Ostensen never stated that he would object to Blue Anchor Lines Limited's joinder to the Federal Court action but it is obvious that he never said that he would agree to join the action. I am not impressed with the manner in which paragraph 10 is worded. It tends to be misleading.
[49]
The plaintiffs' attorney argues, although the statement of claim was not served within the 12 month delay this does not mean that the statement of claim is to be considered null, it simply has to be renewed.
[50]
For this proposition, the plaintiffs' attorney cites the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), MacKay, J.A., states at page 593:
" <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  L.JJ., disagreed with the statement of Lord Goddard that a writ not served within 12 months was a nullity. Singleton, L.J., at p. 896, said
'I do not regard it as strictly accurate to describe a writ which has not been served within 12 months as a nullity. It is not as though it had never been issued. It is something that can be renewed. The court can grant an application which results in making it just as effective as it was before the 12 months period had elapsed.'"
[51]
There is no doubt that the rules of the Federal Court of Canada permit the extension of time to serve the statement of claim issued within the legal delays. That is, a judge, after having been shown a "sufficient reason" as to why the statement of claim was not served within the 12 month delay prescribed by the rules, can extend the delay of service and in such an event the statement of claim would not be null. Rule 306 clearly sets out this proposition.
[52]
The problem that a plaintiff has when making application for an extension of delay of service is to have "any sufficient reason".
[53]
Unfortunately, after examining all of the detailed argument made before me and after carefully examining all the case law submitted to me by plaintiffs' attorney, I cannot find a single "sufficient" reason for extending the delay of service of the statement of claim.
[54]
I was cited the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at 322 and 323. In this case, the Ontario Court of Appeal, Lacourcière, J.A., states what he believes are some of the factors to be considered, at page 522:
"One factor considered in the exercise of the discretion is defendant's knowledge that an action had been commenced against him."
[55]
In the present case, as I have already stated, there seems to be a serious conflict of views as to whether or not Mr. Ostensen knew that an action was instituted against Blue Anchor Lines Limited in the Federal Court of Canada.
[56]
Mr. Williams in paragraph 9 of the affidavit states, amongst many other alleged facts, "In that conversation, I advised Mr. Ostensen that the cargo's interests were proceeding against the ship owners and Blue Anchor Lines Limited in the Federal Court of Canada".
[57]
Mr. Ostensen, in paragraph 7 of his affidavit states, clearly and concisely: "At no time did Mr. Williams inform me that Blue Anchor Lines Limited were being sued before the Federal Court of Canada".
[58]
I am sure that both parties are reporting the facts to the best of their knowledge and belief. I tend to give more credence to Mr. Ostensen's affidavit. The main reason, if not the sole reason, of the telephone conversation between these two persons was to discuss the question of arbitration and not to discuss legal proceedings that allegedly were instituted against Blue Anchor Lines Limited in the Federal Court of Canada.
[59]
This is even more illustrated when we read in Mr. Williams' affidavit that Mr. Ostensen was of the belief, as he was, that the ship owner was responsible for the damage to the cargo (Paragraph 9 of the affidavit). If this is so, why would Mr. Williams mention that the action in Canada was against Blue Anchor Lines Limited, the charterer.
[60]
I believe that had Mr. Ostensen been informed that an action was instituted against Blue Anchor Lines Limited in Canada, he would have requested from Mr. Williams an undertaking that no appearance would have to be filed into the record of the Federal Court action as was agreed with regard to the appointment of an arbitrator.
[61]
Therefore, I believe that Mr. Ostensen was not made aware of the Federal Court action against the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited.
[62]
Mr. Justice Lacourcière, at page 323 of the Laurin case (supra) went on to state:
"Another factor is the length of time since the cause of action arose and the likelihood of evidence disappearing or losing its reliability."
[63]
Here I agree with plaintiff's attorney when he states that in the present case the application for extension is the only one made and thus the delays are reasonable.
[64]
The cargo was discharged on November 26, 1983, the statement of claim was filed into the Court Registry on November 16, 1984 and the application to extend the delay of service was filed on November 13, 1985, three days before the expiry of 12 months for service.
[65]
Unfortunately for plaintiffs, I am of the belief that because the delays are not out of the ordinary does not mean that a "sufficient reason" to extend delay of service is present.
[66]
There being not a single "sufficient reason" to extend the delay of service of the statement of claim, I must, although reluctantly, maintain the motion before me.
[67]
The attorney for defendant raised a very interesting principle with regard to ex juris service. He stated that it was his view that service ex juris must be effected not only pursuant to foreign law, but also through diplomatic channels. He cites the unreported case of Odeco  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Court of Appeal.
[68]
In that I have ruled that the defendant Blue Anchor Lines Limited's application to set aside the ex parte order extending the time for service of the statement of claim is to be maintained, I do not have to rule on this part of the application.
[69]
Nonetheless, I would state, and with the greatest respect for my brother Cullen, J., I am of the belief that service ex juris is valid if the said service was made in accordance with the instructions given by the judge of the Federal Court of Canada and in accordance with the laws of service in the country where the service is to be effected, no diplomatic intervention should be necessary.
[70]
It, of course, will be for the Federal Court of Appeal to attempt to settle this legal question.
[71]
The application is granted with costs.
Application allowed.
