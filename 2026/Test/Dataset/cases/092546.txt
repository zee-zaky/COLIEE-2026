Muldoon, J.
: In the reasons for judgment released herein on November 24, 1988, it was noted that at the request of counsel for the defendant, the parties were to make their respective written submissions as to the disposition of costs. They have now done so.
[2]
In the review of the parties' submissions, it is apparent that each side offered written terms of settlement to the other and that such terms and settlement were rejected by the party to whom they were addressed. Neither party was willing to accept any compromise proposed by the other party, because each party considered the settlement terms proposed by the other to be unreasonable. The parties stand on an even plane, therefore, when it comes to considering "any offer of settlement made in writing". Of course, neither party is obliged to settle the litigation on whatever terms the other party considers to be reasonable simply to avert a trial.
[3]
Although the defendant's counsel adverted on the last day of the trial audience to some payment into court, none such is mentioned in the defendant's written submissions, and no such payment was effected. Rule 344(3)(f) provides that such a payment may be considered by the court in exercising its discretionary power pursuant to rule 344(1).
[4]
Newly enacted Rules of this court regarding costs were promulgated in SOR/87-221. The emphasis changed. Although the unspoken and unspecified general practice that "costs follow the event" should remain as a general, ordinary disposition, the reformed Rules emphasize that "the court shall have
full discretionary power
over payment of the costs of all parties involved in any proceeding". (Rule 344(1)(new)) This states the law, indeed, but with stress on the full discretionary power. The court's discretion is not fettered by the lists of matters to be considered, expressed in rules 344(3) and (6) and in rule 346(1.1), so long as they be in fact considered.
[5]
Specifically the new Rules provide:
"344(2) Costs may be awarded to or against the Crown.
. . . . .
"344(5) Notwithstanding any other provisions in these Rules, the court has the discretionary power
(a) to award or refuse costs in respect of a particular issue or part of a proceeding;
(b) to award a percentage of taxed costs or award taxed costs up to and for a particular stage of a proceeding; or
(c) to award all or part of the costs on a solicitor and client basis.
"344(6) The court may give directions to the taxing officer and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the court in any particular proceeding may give directions
(a) respecting increases over the amounts specified for the items in Tariff B;
(b) respecting services rendered or disbursements incurred that are not included in Tariff B; and
(c) to permit the taxing officer to consider factors other than those specified in rules 346(1.1) and (1.2) when costs are taxed."
[6]
There is a notional "watershed" in considering whether to depart from the ordinarily taxable costs, which ordinarily follow the event. That "watershed" is a datum line or zone at or within which the court will neither order the costs to be increased above those ordinarily taxable nor order them to be diminished below those ordinarily taxable. It requires great and exemplary merit on a party's part to induce the court to increase the award of costs and, by nature, such inducement is not easy to achieve.
[7]
The matter may be contemplated from both sides, but the net effect is that the tariff is rarely exceeded. Thus, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it was held that the apparent or real difficulty inhering in the litigation, or the volume of solicitors' and counsel's work, or even the recognized importance of the case do not provide an inevitable and certain basis for exceeding the tariff. So, also, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Chief Justice Thurlow for an unanimous division of the Federal Court of Appeal, rejected the successful party's application for increased costs on the basis of complex and extensive preparation. The decision was rendered orally, from the bench, on the conclusion of the applicant's distinguished counsel's argument, without even calling upon the respondent's counsel. Another decision of the Appeal Division of this court, which is to be noted in this regard, is  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , especially at pp. 180 and 181 F.C. Finally, in abridging an extensive inventory of jurisprudence, the court mentions the decision of Mr. Justice Rouleau of this bench in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , wherein he is reported at p. 495 as holding:
"I am satisfied that in this case I can take into account the
previous conduct
of the respondents which led to this litigation and it is my duty to consider the whole of the circumstances of the case and what led to the action, the necessity of lengthy cross-examinations of witnesses, and the unusually prolonged argument for costs." (emphasis not in original text)
In the RCP Inc. case, above cited, the court, on one of those rare occasions, permitted the successful party's costs to exceed the tariff, and awarded a global sum, for the above quoted reasons.
[8]
So, in the case at bar, the previous conduct of the defendant's personnel has been noted in the reasons for judgment issued in this case at bar at pages 10 and 11 and again mentioned at page 25, as the plaintiff alluded to in his written submissions on costs. For comparison, a more serious instance may be noted in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 14, wherein Joyal, J., denied costs entirely to the successful defendant. For that previous conduct, found to be insensitive and anxiety-inflicting, the court will not impose any positive penalty in costs upon the defendant, but neither does the defendant deserve any medals for it. (This court follows the Appeal Division's judgment in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 87 F.C., and 88.) So on this ground, too, the defendant's application for increased costs of and incidental to this action will be dismissed.
[9]
The decision of this court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Inc. stands astride the datum, zone or line at which the court considers whether or not to increase the successful party's costs or, on the other side, whether or not to diminish the award of costs to be taxed by that party. The RCP Inc. decision imports the factor of
conduct
, which in regard to counsel, may be described as
deportment
, both professional and physical.
[10]
The court, at page 30 of the published reasons for judgment, expressed disapproval of the defendant's counsel's deportment. Insofar as the trial of this action is concerned, the matter was moderately serious, but so long as counsel does not persist in those unacceptable manners, it is not so serious as to jeopardize counsel's position at the Bar or in his employment. But, here again the defendant earns no medals and indeed ought justly to be penalized in costs. Justice department counsel appear so frequently in the Federal Court of Canada that some of them might tend to take for granted the liberties, which some arrogate to themselves; and they lapse into conduct which they observably do not permit themselves in the provincial superior courts, if not in all provincial courts. So it was with the defendant's counsel in the case at bar. Now, rarely is counsel's conduct all bad or all good. So, it was with the defendant's counsel again in the case at bar. The court recognizes that on several occasions during the trial he helped the plaintiff, who appeared without counsel, to find and identify pertinent documents among the many which were placed before the court. That helps to redress the balance.
[11]
The conduct of counsel at trial has been considered in the exercise of the court's discretion in awarding costs. The matter is not within the purview of rule 348, because it is not here proposed to levy any costs against counsel, personally. In regard to costs of litigation where the matter of conduct is less serious than that which is contemplated in rule 348, but where costs were denied to the successful party, the following cases in the Federal Court are noted:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  professional conduct of counsel (C.A.)
Another, even more recent example of disapproved and objectively offensive conduct of the litigation precipitating an adverse award of costs - in fact, solicitor-and-client costs payable by the unsuccessful party - is Mr. Justice Strayer's decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  principle. Adverse exceptional awards of costs are not made against litigants who are merely and unexceptionably trying to assert their rights, even if they be wrong, and accordingly, unsuccessful.
[12]
Now, lest there be any misunderstanding, and for that purpose only, the litany of counsel's unacceptable conduct during the trial of this action ought to be stated, at least in point form. It consisted of:
- addressing the court while lounging in his chair;
- wandering about the area of the courtroom reserved for counsel, sometimes with his back turned to the bench, while questioning witnesses and while addressing the court;
- carrying and indeed brandishing a wooden stick (which had become detached from the lectern) while cross-examining the plaintiff;
- engaging in high-decibel speech, which amounted to yelling, addressed to the court and to the plaintiff; and
- gratuitously, snidely and irrelevantly suggesting sotto voce to the plaintiff during cross-examination that the plaintiff had been "run off the reserve at Cape Croker" an allegation which was not pleaded, was not relevant to the issues to be resolved, and which was calculated to cause turmoil in this plaintiff, appearing without counsel, as the defendant's counsel ought to have known.
Enough is enough, and while the court will not deny costs entirely to the defendant, it will surely diminish costs in light of the above. The record will disclose that the court either called these lapses to counsel's attention, or pointedly admonished the plaintiff, who acted for himself, not to imitate the bad habits of his adversary. The record will also disclose that when, on several occasions, the plaintiff appeared to be embarking on a lengthy rebuttal of counsel's gratuitous remark, the court both admonished and assured the plaintiff that such remark was not evidence and was in any event irrelevant. If the plaintiff had been represented by counsel of his own, the effect might well have been different, and less disruptive of the orderly devolution of the trial.
[13]
In light of all this, the plaintiff now seeks to avoid the payment of any costs whatever to the defendant. However, it would in the circumstances, depart too far from the traditional rule that costs follow the event, to deny the defendant its costs altogether. After all, the plaintiff chose, as was his right, to pursue his action and he lost. The principle is that costs are awarded even against impecunious prisoners whose suits are dismissed:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), and further affirmed, by the Supreme Court of Canada, again without comment [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821; 30 N.R. 380. In these circumstances then, costs are a fortiori to be imposed upon the plaintiff.
[14]
In his written submission as to costs, the defendant's counsel asked for:
"3(c) all reasonable disbursements incurred by the defendant with respect to all of its witnesses who attended the trial, and remained in Ottawa until discharged by the court or tendered to the defendant for cross-examination (Tariff A);"
Some witnesses whom the defendant had present at trial under subpoena were called by the defendant's counsel to testify orally, some were not so called and they remained outside of the courtroom. The defendant's counsel decided not to call this latter group either because he believed that they would not be needed to sustain the defence and/or because the parties' estimated time-span for the duration of the trial would be exceeded. Having come to his decision about not calling those persons to be witnesses for the defence, the defendant's counsel offered to call them for cross-examination by the plaintiff. The plaintiff wanted nothing to do with that proposal. In such a circumstance, the plaintiff ought not to have to contribute a cent to the defendant's costs of securing the attendance of any persons whom counsel decided not to call to testify for the defendant. In that regard this request is disallowed.
[15]
The court, finally, awards taxable party and party costs to the successful defendant herein, but on a diminished scale, in order to mark the court's disapproval of the conduct at trial evinced by the defendant's counsel. In Tariff B, item 1(i), the defendant's counsel fee will be reduced from what it provides:
"per half day spent in court, up to $300.00"
down to: "per half day spent in court, up to $150.00", and further the sum which the defendant might now have taxed on this reduced basis shall be further reduced by the elimination of one complete half day (which now could amount to only $150.00 at most). The court's disapproval is marked by the foregoing reductions of taxable counsel fees, which reductions the court considers to be just right, in the circumstances. This is not to say that different deplorable circumstances, or further unacceptable conduct during other trials, will not carry more costly disapproval. Indeed, if such again be the case, the court can guarantee that the price, in terms of reduction or outright elimination of costs, will surely escalate.
[16]
In the result the defendant is awarded reduced party and party costs as above described after taxation thereof. The plaintiff, who might still be without counsel, must realize that the defendant's costs, after taxation thereof, constitute the judgment of the court for a sum of money which he will be obliged to pay.
[17]
As mentioned in the court's reasons for judgment issued herein on November 24, 1988, the defendant's solicitors may, pursuant to rule 337(2)(b), prepare a draft of an appropriate judgment to implement the dispositions effected in those and these reasons, and move for judgment accordingly.
Judgment accordingly.
