Joyal, J.
: The Deputy Attorney General of Canada, on behalf of the Secretary of State, appeals to this court from a decision of citizenship judge Suzanne Warren dated October 16, 1985. In that decision, Judge Warren approved an application for citizenship by the respondent for a grant of citizenship under s. 5(1) of the Citizenship Act.
[2]
The grounds of appeal are that the citizenship judge erred in law and in fact in granting citizenship before the respondent had accumulated the necessary three years of residence in Canada as is required in paragraph 5(1)(b) of the Citizenship Act.
[3]
At the hearing of the appeal before me, an appeal which is substantially a trial de novo, the evidence adduced complied in all respects, as far as I can see, with the evidence put before Citizenship Judge Warren. On that evidence, Judge Warren had concluded that the respondent met the requirements of s. 5(1)(b) of the statute. The indicia she adopted to make her determination were roughly as follows:
(1) the respondent had always resided with his family.
(2) although the residence in Toronto was owned by the respondent's sister and brother-in-law, his parents also resided there.
(3) the money for the purchase of the residence had been advanced by the respondent's father.
(4) whenever absent from Canada, the respondent's personal effects and household goods other than clothing were left in the common residence.
(5) the respondent always obtained Returning Resident Permits when absent from Canada.
(6) the respondent was now employed at the Hong Kong branch of a Canadian bank, the Chemical Bank of Canada.
[4]
The conclusions drawn by the court below were that notwithstanding the long periods of absence from Canada either in Hong Kong where he assisted his father, or at Harvard Business School from which he graduated as an M.B.A. on June 6, 1985, the respondent complied with the extended meaning of "residence" which jurisprudence had given to it. Two cases cited in this respect were In re Papadogiorgakis and in re Citizenship Act, [1978] 2 C.F. 208, a decision of the then Associate Chief Justice Thurlow of this court and In re Secretary of State of Canada and Abi-Zeid (1983), 4 D.L.R.(4th) 664, a decision of Mr. Justice Dubé.
[5]
As I read these cases, physical presence in Canada is not required to establish the residency requirements under the Act. What must be gleaned from all the evidence is the finding of an intention to return and, a contrario, no abandonment of Canadian residency.
[6]
I might have certain misgivings as to the extended meaning of "residence". I might ponder on the consequential withering away of the three-out-of-four-year residency requirements of s. 5. I might reflect on the singular ease with which as precious a status as Canadian citizenship can be obtained when all which might be required of a landed immigrant is a place in Canada where he can hang his hat while he goes about conducting his various businesses as before, only to return when his four years are up to claim his citizenship papers.
[7]
Yet, these musings should not clutter the issues before me. The extended meaning given to the residency rule is well-established and I should be loathe to infect it with more commentary. I must keep in mind that in accordance with the dictum of Walsh, J., in the matter of Re Kleifges (1978), 84 D.L.R.(3d) 183, the provisions of the Citizenship Act should be given a liberal interpretation especially when, as in so many cases, an applicant would otherwise make an excellent citizen. I must also have respect for the comments of Grant, D.J., in Re Roberts (1978), 92 D.L.R. (3d) 76, that it was the intention of Parliament in amending the Citizenship Act to relieve persons seeking citizenship from the strict rule requiring complete physical presence in Canada.
[8]
I will agree with counsel for the appellant that the respondent's initial period of residence when he first entered Canada on August 28, 1981, was very brief. He returned to Hong Kong some nine days later. It might be argued that in those circumstances, the respondent had not established a Canadian residence at all. On the other hand, the respondent did arrive in Canada at the same time as his parents and his sister and the citizenship judge could conclude on the facts before her that the respondent had made of the family home his place of abode to which he always returned from time to time.
[9]
Her finding in this respect is that the residence of his sister and brother-in-law in Toronto was the only residence to which he returned. Especially during the last two years of his qualifying period when the respondent was completing his studies at Harvard were these return visits frequent. The citizenship judge gave credence to the respondent's evidence in this respect. I gather also that she gave some weight to the fact that the respondent, upon graduation, had immediately obtained an appointment with a Canadian company whose Hong Kong operations required a person with the respondent's particular qualifications.
[10]
The case is a border-line one and I should guess that it would be open to anyone to reach a different conclusion on the same set of facts. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the decision constitutes an error of law or that there was no evidence to support it. The conclusion drawn by the citizenship judge is consonant with the evidence before her and I see no reason to interfere with it.
[11]
I must accordingly dismiss the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
