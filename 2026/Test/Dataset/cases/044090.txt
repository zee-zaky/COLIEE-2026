INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of a Senior Immigration Officer (Officer), dated 30 August 2011 (Decision), which refused the Applicant's application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA).
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a 29-year-old Tamil male from Northern Sri Lanka. He has been in Canada since May, 2010. The Applicant left Sri Lanka in December, 2009. He originally left Sri Lanka using his own passport, but obtained a false passport from Belize which he used to enter Mexico, and then the United States. Upon entering the U.S., the Applicant filed an asylum claim. His claim was making progress - Immigration officials in the U.S. had determined he had a credible fear in Sri Lanka - but the Applicant abandoned that claim to come to Canada. The Applicant filed a refugee claim upon entering Canada in May, 2010.
[3]
The Applicant's refugee claim was heard by a panel of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on 24 March 2011. The Applicant based his refugee claim upon a fear of persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan police and army due to his profile as a young Tamil male from the North. He also stated that in February, 2009 he was questioned by the army and told not to leave the country. The RPD found the Applicant not to be credible based on discrepancies in his claim, a lack of documentation, and the abandonment of his U.S. claim. The RPD determined the Applicant was not personally at risk and denied his refugee claim.
[4]
The Applicant filed a PRRA application on 30 November 2011. He did not submit any personal documents in support of his application, but did include a number of documents about country conditions in Sri Lanka. All of these documents post-date the Applicant's refugee hearing. Most of the documents submitted by the Applicant come from the US Department of State, Amnesty International, or the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB). The consensus amongst these documents is that conditions in Sri Lanka have not changed much in recent years. The IRB document LKA103782.E, dated 12 July 2011, states specifically that the situation in Sri Lanka has not changed since February, 2011.
[5]
The Applicant submitted two documents that speak directly to the risks faced by failed refugee claimants: an Amnesty International document dated 16 June 2011 and IRB document LKA103815.E dated 22 August 2011. The Amnesty International document discusses the detention and torture of failed refugee claimants, and states that Tamil returnees may face safety risks. This is found on pages 111 and 113 of the Certified Tribunal Record (CTR). LKA103815.E (pages 232-233 of the CTR) discusses how officials are made aware of the impending arrival of failed asylum seekers and cites the same risks mentioned in the Amnesty International document. It also states, on page 239, that returnees are often portrayed in the media as "traitors" and may be particularly vulnerable to abduction and extortion.
[6]
The Officer considered the Applicant's PRRA application and rejected it on 6 March 2012.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[7]
The Decision in this case consists of a letter sent by the Officer to the Applicant on 6 March 2012, along with the Officer's notes on the file. The Officer rejected the PRRA application because he determined the Applicant would not face a risk of persecution if returned to Sri Lanka. He also found the Applicant would not face a risk to his life or a risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned.
[8]
The Officer noted the main risk to the Applicant as being mistreatment due to his being a failed refugee claimant returning from the West, as well as a young Tamil male from the North of Sri Lanka who may be suspected of having ties to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Arbitrary detainment, torture, and extortion were also cited as potential risks. The Officer noted that all the materials submitted with the PRRA application were general in nature and did not refer specifically to the Applicant.
[9]
The Officer stated that subsection 113(a) of the Act establishes that only evidence which arises after the refugee decision, or which was not reasonably available, can be presented on a PRRA application. He stated that the allegations of risk presented by the Applicant could have been raised before the RPD panel, but since the submissions post-date that time he proceeded to consider them.
Documentary Evidence
[10]
The Officer started his evaluation of the documentary evidence by stating that although he had not mentioned each individual document, he had reviewed them all. He then made a quick review of the US Department of State and Amnesty International documents. As regards the Amnesty International document dated 16 June 2011, the Officer found that all it said was that "young Tamil men from Northern or Eastern Sri Lanka remain at particular risk of persecution." The Officer then discussed the IRB document LKA103782.E, dated 12 July 2011. That document states that the situation has not changed since February 2011, and that young Tamil males from Northern Sri Lanka continue to face harassment from security officers.
[11]
The Officer then considered the IRB document LKA103815.E, dated 22 August 2011. He noted that it states that the risk of interrogation upon re-entry into Sri Lanka is faced primarily by those who left the country in an unauthorized way. The Officer found that because the Applicant left the country in a permitted way and using his own passport he would not be perceived as having left the country illegally. There was also no personal documentation submitted to suggest he would be perceived as having ties to the LTTE upon returning to Sri Lanka. The document states that Tamils with a history of opposing the government may be targeted, but again there was nothing to suggest that this would be relevant to the Applicant.
[12]
The Officer noted that LKA103815.E says that the Canadian High Commission in Sri Lanka had found only four cases of people being detained, and that the Ratmalana-based
Sunday Leader
had found no reports of mistreatment of returnees. The Officer further noted that a police spokesperson told the Colombo-based
Sunday Observer
that people are only detained for questioning if they have criminal records, and that all rejected asylum seekers made it safely to their homes.
[13]
The Officer also noted that LKA103815.E identified returnees who do not successfully reintegrate into society after arrival as being particularly at risk. The Officer pointed out that the Applicant's mother, siblings, and extended family still live in Sri Lanka, and that he has been away for less than three years. The Officer found that there was no indication the Applicant would not reintegrate into society successfully, and that this particular risk was not relevant to the Applicant.
[14]
The Officer then considered the publicly available IRB document LKA103663.E. This document states that returned Tamil asylum seekers are routinely questioned, as are Tamils flying into the Colombo airport who are not deportees. The Officer found the evidence as a whole indicated that Tamil returnees may face questioning upon their arrival in Sri Lanka, but it is those with criminal records or suspected LTTE links who are primarily at risk.
[15]
The Officer then considered the publicly available UNHCR July 2010
Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum Seekers from Sri Lanka
(UNHCR Guidelines). This document states that there is no longer a need for presumptive eligibility for Tamils from the North, and asylum-seekers should be considered on their individual merits. Five profiles are indicated as being particularly at risk, none of which are applicable to the Applicant.
[16]
The Officer also noted that the Applicant has an 18-year-old brother who resides in Jaffna. The Applicant did not indicate that his brother or other siblings have been subject to mistreatment. Considering this, and the submitted materials about conditions in Sri Lanka, the Officer found the Applicant's profile does not put him personally at risk. The Officer stated that though harassment of young Tamil males from the North continues, in the case of the Applicant it does not amount to persecution as defined in sections 96 or 97 of the Act.
[17]
The Officer found, based on the Applicant's submissions and the Officer's own research of publicly available documents, that there had not been a material change in country conditions in Sri Lanka since the RPD hearing. There was insufficient evidence presented to find the Applicant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution, and the Officer therefore refused the Applicant's PRRA application.
ISSUES
[18]
The issues raised by the Applicant are:
1. Did the Officer err by using the wrong standard of proof when conducting the section 96 analysis?
2. Was the Officer's decision reasonable?
3. Were the Officer's reasons adequate?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[19]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[20] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> states, at paragraph 55, that a pure question of law of central importance to the legal system and outside the decision maker's area of expertise will be decided on a standard of correctness. The Federal Court of Appeal determined in
Cyprus (Commerce and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the applicable burden of proof is evaluated on a standard of correctness. Thus, this will be the standard of review applicable to the first issue.
[21]
A PRRA decision is highly discretionary and fact-based, and one that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> dictates is owed deference.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice John O'Keefe held the standard of review applicable to a PRRA Officer's decision is reasonableness. Justice Maurice Lagacé made a similar finding in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s did Justice Marie-Josée Bédard in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The standard of review applicable to the Officer's decision in this case is reasonableness.
[22]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
[23]
The Supreme Court of Canada recently addressed the issue of the adequacy of reasons in
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It held at paragraph 14 that the adequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision. Rather, "the reasons must be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes." The adequacy of the Officer's reasons will be analyzed along with the reasonableness of the Decision as a whole.

ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
The Burden of Proof
[25]
The Applicant states that he did not have to show that he would face persecution if returned to Sri Lanka, but only that there was more than a mere possibility that he would face persecution if returned. Cases such as
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) establish that the appropriate standard of proof under section 96 of the Act is less than a balance of probabilities but more than a mere possibility of persecution.
[26]
The Applicant concedes that the Officer stated the correct test in the Decision, but argues that the Officer misapplied the test and used shifting burdens of proof throughout the Decision. The Applicant says that the Officer used the incorrect burden of proof multiple times throughout the Decision, and cites the following statements of the Officer as examples:
a. The Applicant did not show that his profile is one that "would attract" undue attention or reprisal (CTR, page 6);
b. The Applicant did not show that he "would be perceived" as someone who had left the country illegally (CTR, page 7);
c. The Applicant did not present a satisfactory explanation for why he "would be detained" upon returning to Sri Lanka (CTR, page 7);
d. The Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to show that he "would be perceived" as a person with LTTE links or with a history of opposing the government (CTR, page 8);
e. The documentation did not show that the Applicant "will be arrested, harmed, or otherwise targeted" (CTR, page 8).
[27]
The Applicant states that the Officer misunderstood the applicable burden of proof. The Applicant quotes Justice Yves de Montigny in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], where he said at paragraph 31:
Of course, the mere use of the words "will" or "would" is not, in and of itself, sufficient to conclude that the officer applied the wrong legal test, especially if this is an isolated occurrence. Regard must be had to the decision as a whole, as this Court has made clear on a number of occasions: see, for example,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.). On the other hand, the mere recital at the very end of an assessment of a standard formula with respect to the correct threshold will not cure the deficiencies found elsewhere in the reasons.
The Applicant states that the wrong burden of proof was used multiples times throughout the Decision; it was not an isolated occurrence.
[28]
The Applicant asserts that if the Decision demonstrates that more than one standard was used, or is unclear as to what standard was used, this is an error.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Applicant says that if the Court cannot be certain as to whether the Officer properly understood the test then the Decision should be quashed, and cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in support of this proposition.
[29]
Post hearing, the Applicant has provided the Court with the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and urges this Court to adopt the reasoning contained in paragraphs 84-87 of that decision.
The Reasonableness of the Decision
[30]
The Applicant says that the Officer was selective in his evaluation of documents and that he ignored evidence. For example, in the Officer's evaluation of document LKA103815.E he focused on the Applicant's ability to reintegrate, but ignored the part of the document that said that returnees might be detained, tortured, and held in "brutal" conditions upon arrival.
[31]
The Applicant asserts that by ignoring evidence the Officer failed to properly consider the issue of cumulative persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice John O'Keefe said at paras 23-28:
The Federal Court of Appeal and this Court have both held that a series of discriminatory events which individually do not give rise to persecution, may amount to persecution when considered cumulatively (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.) at paragraph 42).
The respondent submits that in the PRRA application, the officer only found sufficient evidence to support the risk that the applicant may be subject to extortion at the airport and that this one incident cannot create cumulative persecution.
I find that the officer failed to consider cumulative persecution. For example, in the H&C decision, the officer accepted that the applicant may have to register with police and may be questioned by state security agencies if he wishes to reside in Colombo, or, if he resides in Jaffna, the applicant might be required to proceed through security checkpoints and register with the police.
These findings of fact were absent from the PRRA decision. As both decisions were made on the same day by the same officer, these findings should have formed part of the PRRA decision and the officer should have assessed whether the applicant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution on the basis of these discriminatory actions.
I cannot know whether the officer would have found cumulative persecution in the PRRA analysis had he considered these other discriminatory events.
As such, based on the errors of law above, I must allow the judicial review for both the PRRA and H&C applications. If the PRRA is faulty, then the same would follow for the H&C.
The Applicant states that this decision shows that the issue of cumulative persecution was not properly considered by the Officer.
[32]
The Applicant claims that it was erroneous of the Officer to find that the risk is one that should have been raised with the RPD, but concedes that the Officer did assess the new allegation of risk.
Inadequate Reasons
[33]
The Applicant further asserts that the reasons of the Officer are not adequate. The Officer found that the Applicant may be subject to discrimination but then concluded that the discrimination would not amount to persecution without elaborating as to why. The Applicant argues that the inadequacy of the reasons contributes to the unreasonableness of the Decision.
The Respondent
Correct Test
[34]
The Respondent points out that the Applicant has conceded that the Officer articulated the test properly. When one considers the reasons as a whole they demonstrate that the correct test was applied. The Decision neither states nor implies that the decision was based on a balance of probabilities, as alleged by the Applicant.
The Reasonableness of the Decision
[35]
The Respondent points out that the Applicant did not submit any personalized evidence to support the allegation that he fits the profile described in the general evidence. Justice de Montigny found in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that "in the absence of evidence showing personalized risk, country conditions alone are not sufficient for a positive PRRA determination". See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[36]
The Respondent points out that it is up to the Applicant to make the connection between country conditions and his personal circumstances; he failed to do so in this case. The Officer considered the objective evidence submitted about conditions in Sri Lanka, but the burden was on the Applicant to provide evidence demonstrating that he personally would face the risks alleged (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[37]
The Officer noted the troublesome country conditions in Sri Lanka, but reasonably found that this alone was not enough to establish that the Applicant would face the risks alleged. For example, the Officer noted that the objective evidence said that people who leave Sri Lanka in unauthorized ways may face problems upon re-entry, but that the Applicant left the country on his own passport and in a permitted way, so there was no evidence demonstrating that this is a risk that the Applicant himself would face.
[38]
The objective evidence also indicated that individuals suspected of having LTTE links, a history of opposing the government, or outstanding criminal charges were at risk of arrest or detention upon arrival in Sri Lanka. The Officer noted that the evidence did not indicate that failed refugee claimants or Tamil males from the North are generally considered to have LTTE links, and the Applicant did not provide any evidence that indicated that he would be perceived as having LTTE links or outstanding criminal charges. The Officer also noted that the Applicant's 18-year-old brother who resides in Jaffna - a similarly situated individual - had not been subjected to any mistreatment. The Officer's conclusion that the Applicant had not established that he fits the profile of people at risk described in the documentary evidence was reasonable.
[39]
The Respondent submits that there was no need for the Officer to make an explicit finding in regards to cumulative persecution; whether the Applicant's past experiences amounted to persecution is not a relevant issue in this case. The proper approach to a claim of cumulative persecution is to assess the cumulative effect of past incidents that the Applicant has faced (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In this case, the RPD already determined that the Applicant's statements regarding past incidents that occurred in Sri Lanka were not credible. It was not the Officer's job to look into this finding.
[40]
The Respondent submits that the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, above, relied on by the Applicant, is distinguishable on the facts. In that case, the officer had acknowledged certain risks in the applicant's H&C application, but not in the PRRA application. Had all the risks been acknowledged in the PRRA application their sum would have amounted to persecution. In the case at hand, the Applicant simply has not established the risks alleged. The Applicant failed to demonstrate a link between his personal situation and conditions for Tamils returning to Sri Lanka, and thus it cannot be said that the Officer unreasonably ignored the issue of cumulative persecution.
[41]
The Applicant concedes that the Officer assessed the newly claimed risks; thus it is clear that the Officer did not rely on whether or not the risk allegations could have been presented to the RPD in making his decision. The Officer's reasons demonstrate that he considered all of the Applicant's evidence and submissions as to risk (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), but came to the conclusion that they were not sufficient to establish the risk alleged. The Respondent submits that the Officer applied the correct burden of proof and that the Decision is reasonable.
ANALYSIS
[42]
The Applicant asserts that the "PRRA officer erred in part because the Applicant had not proven
on the balance of probabilities
that he would be subject to harm." [Emphasis added]. This is an assertion that the Applicant was subjected to a higher burden of proof in establishing his claim to protection than the law requires.
[43]
Nowhere in the Decision does the Officer specifically say that the burden of proof on the Applicant is "balance of probabilities" as regards section 96 persecution. In fact, the Officer clearly states in the summary that the burden is "more than a mere possibility" for section 96 persecution and "more likely than not to face a danger of torture, or a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment" under section 97.
[44]
The Applicant concedes that the Officer correctly states the test in the summary. The issue is whether, at other places in the Decision, the Officer applies some other test. The case law is clear that, in deciding this issue, "regard must be had to the decision as a whole." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above.
[45]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the case relied upon by the Applicant, the Court found that this issue was "borderline" and that "if the officer had made no other reviewable error, I do not think this would be sufficient to quash his decision."
[46]
The law in this area was recently reviewed by Justice Leonard Mandamin in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
In my view, the RPD failed to clearly articulate and apply the proper legal test for the Applicant's section 96 Convention refugee claim. In
Mugadza
at paras 20-22 I stated:
[20] The legal test or standard of proof to be met by an applicant for refugee status asserting a fear of persecution was addressed by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [1989] F.C.J. No. 67, above. Justice MacGuigan, considering the proper interpretation of section 2(1)(a) of "Convention refugee" in the former
Immigration Act
, the forerunner to s. 96(a) IRPA stated:
However, the issue raised before this Court related to the well-foundedness of any subjective fear, the so-called objective element, which requires that the refugee's fear be evaluated objectively to determine if there is a valid basis for that fear.
It was common ground that the objective test is not so stringent as to require a probability of persecution. In other words, although an applicant has to establish his case on a balance of probabilities, he does not nevertheless have to prove the persecution would be more likely than not. Indeed, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 437, Heald J.A. said:
Accordingly, it is my opinion that the board erred in imposing on this applicant and his wife the requirement that they would be subject to persecution since the statutory definition supra required only that they establish "a well-founded fear of persecution". The test imposed by the board is a higher and more stringent test than that imposed by the statute.
[...]
We would adopt that phrasing, which appears be equivalent to that employed by
Pratte J.A. in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (A-277-822 (dated January 12, 1983):
... [I]n order to support a finding that an applicant is a convention refugee, the evidence must not necessarily show that he "has suffered or would suffer persecution"; what the evidence must show is that the applicant has good grounds for fearing persecution for one of the reasons specified in the Act.
What is evidently indicated by phrases such as "good grounds" or "reasonable chance" is, on one hand, that there need not be more than a 50% chance (i.e., a probability), and on the other hand that there must be a more than a minimal possibility. We believe this can also be expressed as a "reasonable" or even a "serious possibility", as opposed to a mere possibility.
[21] The Board's reasons are to be taken as a whole.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2005 FC 1472 at paras. 24, Justice Lemieux in deciding whether the board erred in its application of the section 96 test by setting out two slightly different tests held:
In this case, looking at the impugned decisions as a whole, I find the tribunal expressed itself sufficiently and did not impose an inappropriate burden on the applicants. The tribunal conveyed the essence of the appropriate standard of proof, that is,
[22]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2005 FC 4 at paras. 6, Justice O'Reilly stated:
[t]his is an awkward standard of proof to articulate. This Court has recognized that various expressions of this standard are acceptable, so long as the Board's reasons taken as a whole indicate that there the claimant was not put to an unduly onerous burden of proof.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Rennie stated:
With respect to the second error, the applicant testified that she had been kidnapped and beaten by the FARC. The RPD insisted on "conclusive proof" of the allegation
. The RPD also rejected Ms. Alvarez'claim as it was not satisfied "on the balance of probabilities, she was not or is not a target of the FARC." Neither of these findings are predicated on the appropriate legal standard. The principle applicant did not have the burden of providing either conclusive proof or proof on a balance of probabilities. The test is whether there was a serious possibility of persecution or harm.
As O'Reilly J. noted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the Board has incorrectly elevated the standard of proof, or the court cannot determine what standard of proof was actually applied, a new hearing can be ordered: see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . This too is, therefore a reviewable error. [Emphasis added]
...
While the RPD is tasked with examining the facts which the Applicant relies to hold a subjective well founded fear of persecution, it cannot put itself into the Applicant's shoes and apply the civil balance of probabilities to decide if the Applicant's subjective fear is well founded or not. By doing so, the RPD erred in imposing a stricter standard.
At paragraph 43 of its decision, the following conclusion of the RPD is a further illustration that it applied the incorrect standard of proof:
For these reasons
, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the Sri Lankan government does not wish to arrest the claimant and does not perceive him to have ties to the LTTE
, even though he is a young Tamil male from the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka. [Emphasis added]
The RPD's decision, however, contains two paragraphs that refer to the correct test:
the Panel finds that there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted should he return to Sri Lanka and that his fear is not well founded.
[Certified Tribunal Record - RPD Decision at para 63]
As the claimant adduced no other evidence nor does the documentation support a finding that he would face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Sri Lanka or that he will be persecuted or be subjected personally to a risk to his life, or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture by any authority in Sri Lanka, the claim for refugee protection must fail. [Certified Tribunal Record - RPD Decision at para 68]
In my view, these later statements do not salvage the RPD's decision since, at best, the RPD applies inconsistent standards of proof for its s. 96 analysis.
[47]
The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case referred to by Justice Mandamin also had the following to say on point at paragraphs 7-9:
By contrast, in cases where the Board seemed to be demanding too much proof from a claimant, the Court has ordered a new hearing. For example, Chief Justice Julius Isaac found that the Board had erred when it stated that it was "not convinced that the claimant faces a reasonable chance that he would be persecuted for his political opinions should he return to Bulgaria" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.)(QL); see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (QL)). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice MacGuigan disapproved of the Board's expression of the standard of proof when it said that the evidence before it was "insufficient for it to conclude that there are substantial grounds for thinking that persecution would result...".
The lesson to be taken from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is that the applicable standard of proof combines both the usual civil standard and a special threshold unique to the refugee protection context. Obviously, claimants must prove the facts on which they rely, and the civil standard of proof is the appropriate means by which to measure the evidence supporting their factual contentions. Similarly, claimants must ultimately persuade the Board that they are at risk of persecution. This again connotes a civil standard of proof. However, since claimants need only demonstrate a risk of persecution, it is inappropriate to require them to prove that persecution is probable. Accordingly, they must merely prove that there is a "reasonable chance", "more than a mere possibility" or "good grounds for believing" that they will face persecution.
The case law referred to above shows that where the Board has articulated the gist of the appropriate standard of proof (i.e. the combination of the civil standard with the concept of a "reasonable chance"), this Court has not intervened. On the other hand, where it appears that the Board has elevated the standard of proof, the Court has gone on to consider whether a new hearing is required. Further, if the Court cannot determine what standard of proof was applied, a new hearing may be necessary:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. 1613 (T.D.) (QL).
[48]
The specifics of the Applicant's complaint in the present case are as follows:
7. The PRRA officer erred in part because the Applicant had not proven on the balance of probabilities that he would be subject to harm. See Record, page 12 (the Applicant did not show that he "would attract undue attention or reprisal"); page 13: the Applicant did not show that "he would be perceived" as someone who had left illegally; that he "would be detained upon a return"; page 14: the Applicant did not show that he "would be perceived as a person with LTTE links or with a history of opposing the government"; page 14: the Applicant did not show that "he will be arrested, harmed, or otherwise targeted". These are not isolated occurrences (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , below)
8. The Applicant did not have the legal burden to show that he would face persecution. The PRRA Officer was required to take a further step beyond whether the Applicant
would
face persecution and determine whether there was more than a mere possibility of persecution. The Applicant (
sic
) that the appropriate standard of proof under s. 96 of IRPA is less than a balance of probabilities but more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 120,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C. A.) (QL)).
[49]
The Respondent argues that, in each of these instances, the Officer is simply applying the civil standard of proof to the facts upon which the Applicant seeks to rely for his fear of section 96 persecution or section 97 risk. It is my view that, in assessing and deciding this issue, each case must be examined on its particular facts, and the decision must be reviewed as a whole, in order to determine whether the wrong standard of proof has been applied. I cannot simply adopt the reasoning in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, as the Applicant urges. In my view, there are significant factual and semantic differences between <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and the present case. Also, the essence of the problem in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was a reversal of the onus of proof; that is not at issue here. When I read the Decision as a whole, I believe it reveals that the RPD required the Applicant to establish the facts upon which he relied (i.e. his profile) on a balance of probabilities, but that the RPD applied the correct standard (as stated in the Decision) in assessing whether these facts regarding his profile placed the Applicant at risk of persecution. Consequently, I am unable to accept the Applicant's position that the Decision contains a reviewable error.
[50]
I believe the Applicant is taking the words he cites out of context. Read in context, the instances cited by the Applicant reveal the following:
a. As a general proposition, the "new evidence does not establish that there are new risk developments affecting the applicant, or that the applicant's profile is one that would attract undue attention or reprisal from militant organizations or security forces if he returns to Sri Lanka." In other words, the Applicant has not provided any evidence of new risk or of a profile at risk. This is a comment upon the absence of relevant evidence; it is not a statement about the burden of proof that the Applicant has to satisfy to establish risk under section 96 of the Act;
b. The RPD finds that the Applicant "has not established that he left Sri Lanka illegally" or that he would be perceived as having left illegally. Once again, this is a comment about the absence of evidence on a risk raised by the Applicant. It is not about the burden under section 96 of the Act. In addition, the RPD says that "the applicant does not present a satisfactory explanation for why he would be detained upon a return to Sri Lanka, considering the finding of the RPD panel that he was allowed to leave." This is just another way of saying that the Applicant has not provided an evidentiary basis to support his allegation that he would be detained. It is not about the burden under section 96 of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  persuasive new evidence that he would be perceived as a person with LTTE links or with a history of opposing the government." Once again, in my view, this is a comment about the deficiencies in the new evidence presented by the Applicant; it is not a statement about the degree of risk he needs to establish under section 96 of the Act. The same applies to the RPD's comments that the documentation put forward by the Applicant does not satisfy the RPD that he will be "arrested, harmed, or otherwise targeted as a person with suspected LTTE links, by reason of being a failed asylum claimant because he is a Tamil male from the north, or for any other reason that would warrant a positive decision in this case." In my view, all the RPD is saying is that there is no satisfactory evidence to support the risks put forward by the Applicant. It is not a comment upon the degree of risk that the Applicant must satisfy;
d. The RPD once again comments that "the applicant has not established with sufficient new evidence that his personal profile warrants a positive decision in this case." The RPD then goes on to say that it also finds that "the new evidence does not satisfy me that the country conditions have deteriorated since the rejection of the RPD, or that the applicant's personal circumstances have changed to such an extent as to warrant a finding of risk." In other words, the Applicant has not provided an evidentiary basis that suggests he has a profile of someone at risk.
[51]
Having assessed the quality of the Applicant's new evidence, the RPD then applies the established test for the degree of risk and concludes that the Applicant "does not face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka ...." A full reading of the RPD's words in context does not persuade me that the RPD applied a higher burden of proof than the law requires.
[52]
In my view, then, the RPD does not apply the wrong test, the Decision is reasonable and the reasons are adequate.
[53]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[54]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.
3. The style of cause is amended to remove the "Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness" so that the sole Respondent will be the "Minister of Citizenship and Immigration."

[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande déposée en application du paragraphe 72 (1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi) en vue d'obtenir le contrôle judiciaire de la décision, datée du 30 août 2011 (la décision), par laquelle un agent principal (l'agent) a refusé la demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR) du demandeur.
CONTEXTE
[2]
Le demandeur est un Tamoul du Nord du Sri Lanka. Il est au Canada depuis mai 2010. Le demandeur a quitté le Sri Lanka en décembre 2009, muni de son propre passeport; il s'est ensuite procuré au Belize un faux passeport qu'il a utilisé pour entrer au Mexique, puis aux États-Unis. Arrivé aux États-Unis, le demandeur a déposé une demande d'asile. Le traitement de sa demande progressait bien - en effet, des agents d'immigration des États-Unis avaient établi la crédibilité de sa crainte au Sri Lanka - mais le demandeur s'est désisté de cette demande pour se rendre au Canada. Il a déposé une demande d'asile à son arrivée au Canada en mai 2010.
[3]
La demande d'asile du demandeur a été instruite par un tribunal de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) le 24 mars 2011. Le demandeur a fondé sa demande d'asile sur sa crainte d'être persécuté par la police et l'armée du Sri Lanka à cause de son profil, soit un jeune Tamoul du Nord du pays. Il a aussi déclaré qu'après avoir été interrogé par des militaires en février 2009 et qu'on lui avait dit de ne pas quitter le pays. La SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible à cause des contradictions dans sa demande, de l'absence de documents corroborants et du désistement de sa demande d'asile aux États-Unis. La SPR a établi que le demandeur n'était pas personnellement exposé à des risques et elle a rejeté sa demande d'asile.
[4]
Le demandeur a par la suite déposé une demande d'ERAR le 30 novembre 2011. Il n'a pas présenté de documents personnels à l'appui de sa demande, mais il a fourni un certain nombre de documents au sujet de la situation au Sri Lanka. Tous ces documents portent une date postérieure à l'audition de sa demande d'asile. La majorité des documents soumis par le demandeur proviennent du Département d'État des États-Unis, d'Amnesty International ou de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada (CISR). Selon l'opinion majoritaire qui se dégage de ces documents, la situation au Sri Lanka n'a pas beaucoup évolué au cours des dernières années. Le document LKA103782.EF de la CISR, daté du 12 juillet 2011, indique plus précisément que la situation au Sri Lanka n'a pas changé depuis février 2011.
[5]
Le demandeur a présenté deux documents qui concernent directement les risques que doivent affronter les demandeurs d'asile déboutés: un document d'Amnesty International, daté du 16 juin 2011, et le document LKA103815.EF de la CISR, daté du 22 août 2011. Le document d'Amnesty International aborde la question de la détention et de la torture des demandeurs d'asile déboutés et précise que la sécurité des Tamouls de retour dans leur pays peut être compromise. Ce document figure aux pages 111 et 113 du dossier certifié du tribunal. Quant au document LKA103815.EF (pages 232 et 233 du dossier certifié du tribunal), il aborde la façon dont les fonctionnaires sont informés de l'arrivée imminente de demandeurs d'asile déboutés et mentionne les mêmes risques que ceux dont il est fait état dans le document d'Amnesty International. Il y est de plus indiqué, à la page 239, que les Sri-Lankais de retour sont souvent décrits dans les médias comme des « traîtres » et qu'ils peuvent être particulièrement exposés aux enlèvements et à l'extorsion.
[6]
L'agent a examiné la demande d'ERAR du demandeur et l'a rejetée le 6 mars 2012.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[7]
La décision visée en l'espèce consiste en la lettre envoyée par l'agent au demandeur le 6 mars 2012 et les notes de l'agent incorporées au dossier. L'agent a rejeté la demande d'ERAR parce qu'il a établi que le demandeur ne serait pas exposé au risque d'être persécuté s'il était renvoyé au Sri Lanka. Il a aussi conclu que le demandeur ne serait pas exposé à une menace à sa vie ou au risque d'être soumis à la torture ou à des traitements ou peines cruels et inusités s'il était renvoyé.
[8]
L'agent a souligné que le demandeur était principalement exposé au risque d'être maltraité du fait qu'il est un demandeur d'asile débouté de retour d'un pays occidental de même qu'un jeune Tamoul du Nord du Sri Lanka qui peut être soupçonné d'entretenir des liens avec les Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (TLET). La détention arbitraire, la torture et l'extorsion ont aussi été mentionnées comme risques potentiels. L'agent a souligné que tous les documents soumis avec la demande d'ERAR avaient un caractère général et qu'ils ne concernaient pas précisément le demandeur.
[9]
L'agent a invoqué l'alinéa 113
a
) de la Loi selon lequel seuls les éléments de preuve survenus depuis le rejet de la demande d'asile, ou qui n'étaient alors pas normalement accessibles, peuvent être présentés dans le cas d'une demande d'ERAR. Il a ajouté que les allégations de risque présentées par le demandeur auraient pu l'être devant le tribunal de la SPR, mais, étant donné que les observations avaient été rédigées à une date postérieure à l'audience, il a décidé d'en tenir compte.
Preuve documentaire
[10]
L'agent a entamé son évaluation de la preuve documentaire en précisant que même s'il n'avait pas mentionné chacun des documents, il avait pris connaissance de l'ensemble d'entre eux. Il a ensuite passé rapidement en revue les documents du Département d'État des États-Unis et d'Amnesty International. En ce qui concerne le document d'Amnesty International daté du 16 juin 2011, l'agent a constaté qu'il y était simplement mentionné que les [traduction] « jeunes Tamouls du Nord ou de l'Est du Sri Lanka sont encore particulièrement exposés au risque d'être persécutés ». L'agent a ensuite traité du document LKA103782.EF de la CISR, daté du 12 juillet 2011. Selon ce document, la situation n'a pas changé depuis février 2011 et les jeunes Tamouls du Nord du Sri Lanka sont encore harcelés par les agents des services de sécurité.
[11]
L'agent a ensuite abordé le document LKA103815.EF de la CISR daté du 22 août 2011. Il y est mentionné que ce sont principalement les personnes qui avaient quitté le pays sans autorisation qui courent le risque d'être interrogées à leur retour au Sri Lanka. Selon l'agent, étant donné que le demandeur avait quitté le pays selon les règles, muni de son propre passeport, il ne serait pas considéré comme une personne ayant quitté le pays illégalement. De plus, le demandeur n'a soumis aucun document personnel susceptible de donner à penser qu'il serait considéré, à son retour au Sri Lanka, comme une personne qui a des liens avec les TLET. Selon le document de la CISR, les Tamouls qui se sont déjà opposés au gouvernement peuvent être ciblés, mais, encore une fois, rien ne donnait à penser que c'était le cas du demandeur.
[12]
L'agent a souligné que, selon le document LKA103815.EF, le Haut-commissariat du Canada au Sri Lanka n'avait constaté que quatre cas de détention et le
Sunday Leader
, de Ratmalana, n'avait eu vent d'aucun rapport de mauvais traitements infligés à des rapatriés. L'agent a ajouté qu'un porte-parole de la police avait dit à un journaliste du
Sunday Observer
de Colombo que les gens sont détenus pour interrogatoire uniquement s'ils ont un casier judiciaire et que tous les demandeurs d'asile déboutés avaient pu retourner en toute sécurité à leur domicile.
[13]
L'agent a aussi souligné que, selon le document que LKA103815.EF, les rapatriés qui ne réussissent pas à réintégrer la société après leur arrivée sont particulièrement à risque. L'agent a souligné que la mère, les frères et les membres de la famille élargie du demandeur vivent encore au Sri Lanka et que lui-même ne s'est trouvé à l'étranger que pendant moins de trois ans. Selon l'agent, rien n'indiquait que le demandeur ne réussirait pas à réintégrer la société de son pays et ce risque bien précis ne concernait pas le demandeur.
[14]
L'agent a ensuite abordé le document LKA103663.EF de la CISR, auquel le public a accès. Selon ce document, les demandeurs d'asile tamouls déboutés qui sont de retour au Sri Lanka sont systématiquement interrogés, tout comme les Tamouls qui arrivent à l'aéroport de Colombo, même s'ils n'ont pas été expulsés d'un autre pays. L'agent a estimé que, selon l'ensemble de la preuve, les citoyens tamouls de retour dans leur pays peuvent être interrogés à leur arrivée au Sri Lanka, mais que ce sont ceux qui ont un casier judiciaire ou qui sont soupçonnés d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET qui sont principalement exposés à des risques.
[15]
L'agent a ensuite parcouru le document accessible au public du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCNUR), daté de juillet 2010, et intitulé
Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum Seekers of Sri Lanka
(lignes directrices du HCNUR). Selon ce document, il n'est plus nécessaire de présumer que les Tamouls du Nord du Sri Lanka sont admissibles au statut de réfugié et chaque demande d'asile devrait être évaluée selon la situation de chacun. Le document décrit cinq profils de personnes particulièrement à risque, mais aucun d'eux ne correspond au demandeur.
[16]
L'agent a aussi souligné que le demandeur a un frère de 18 ans qui vit à Jaffna. Le demandeur n'a pas précisé si son frère ou d'autres membres de la fratrie avaient fait l'objet de mauvais traitements. Pour ce motif et compte tenu des documents soumis au sujet de la situation au Sri Lanka, l'agent a conclu que le profil du demandeur ne l'expose pas personnellement à des risques. Selon l'agent, même si le harcèlement de jeunes Tamouls du Nord du pays se poursuit, dans le cas du demandeur, ce harcèlement n'équivaut pas à de la persécution au sens des articles 96 ou 97 de la Loi.
[17]
L'agent a conclu, sur le fondement des observations du demandeur et de ses propres recherches dans des documents accessibles au public, qu'il n'y avait pas eu un changement important dans la situation au Sri Lanka depuis l'audience devant la SPR. Les éléments de preuve présentés ne permettaient pas de conclure que le demandeur était exposé à plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution; par conséquent, l'agent a rejeté la demande d'ERAR.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[18]
Voici les questions soulevées par le demandeur:
1. Est-ce que l'agent a commis une erreur en utilisant une norme de preuve non appropriée dans son analyse relative à l'article 96?
2. La décision de l'agent était-elle raisonnable?
3. Les motifs exposés par l'agent étaient-ils suffisants?
NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[19]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de se livrer à une analyse de la norme de contrôle. En fait, lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière est bien établie par la jurisprudence, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme. Ce n'est que lorsque cette démarche se révèle infructueuse que la cour de révision doit entreprendre l'analyse des quatre facteurs qui permettent de déterminer la bonne norme de contrôle.
[20] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Dunsmuir
, au paragraphe 55, une question de droit qui revêt une importance capitale pour le système juridique et qui est étrangère au domaine d'expertise du décideur doit être tranchée selon la norme de la décision correcte. La Cour d'appel fédérale a établi, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 19, que le fardeau de preuve applicable était évalué selon la norme de la décision correcte. C'est donc la norme de contrôle qui s'appliquera à la première question.
[21]
Une décision d'ERAR a un caractère largement discrétionnaire et elle est fondée sur les faits; de plus, selon <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il faut faire preuve de déférence à l'égard d'une telle décision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge John O'Keefe a statué que la norme de contrôle applicable à la décision d'un agent d'ERAR est celle de la décision raisonnable. Le juge Maurice Lagacé est arrivé à une conclusion semblable dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> tout comme la juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La norme de contrôle applicable à la décision de l'agent en l'espèce est celle de la décision raisonnable.
[22]
Lorsqu'une décision fait l'objet d'un contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse a trait « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47; et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 59). Autrement dit, la Cour ne devrait intervenir que si la décision est déraisonnable en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
[23]
La Cour suprême du Canada a récemment traité de la question du caractère suffisant des motifs dans
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Elle a conclu, au paragraphe 14, que l' « insuffisance » des motifs ne permet pas à elle seule de casser une décision. Il faut plutôt que les motifs soient « examinés en corrélation avec le résultat et ils doivent permettre de savoir si ce dernier fait partie des issues possibles ». Le caractère suffisant des motifs de l'agent sera analysé de pair avec la raisonnabilité de la décision dans son ensemble.

ARGUMENTS
Le demandeur
Le fardeau de la preuve
[25]
Le demandeur soutient qu'il n'avait pas à démontrer qu'il risquerait d'être persécuté s'il était renvoyé au Sri Lanka, mais simplement qu'il existait plus qu'une simple possibilité qu'il le soit en cas de renvoi. Des décisions comme
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) ont établi que la norme de preuve appropriée à l'égard de l'article 96 de la Loi est moins exigeante que celle de la prépondérance des probabilités, mais plus que la simple possibilité de persécution.
[26]
Le demandeur reconnaît que l'agent a énoncé le bon critère dans la décision, mais il allègue que l'agent l'a mal appliqué et qu'il a utilisé des fardeaux de preuve variables tout au long de la décision. Le demandeur soutient que l'agent a appliqué un fardeau de preuve incorrect à de nombreuses reprises tout au long de la décision, et il cite en exemple les déclarations suivantes de l'agent:
a. Le demandeur n'a pas démontré que son profil en est un qui [traduction] « attirerait » une attention indue ou des représailles (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 6).
b. Le demandeur n'a pas démontré qu'il [traduction] « serait perçu » comme une personne qui avait quitté le pays illégalement (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 7).
c. Le demandeur n'a pas expliqué de façon satisfaisante pour quelles raisons il [traduction] « serait détenu » à son retour au Sri Lanka (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 7).
d. Le demandeur n'a pas déposé suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour démontrer qu'il [traduction] « serait perçu » comme une personne ayant des liens avec les TLTE ou possédant des antécédents d'opposition au gouvernement (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 8).
e. La documentation n'a pas permis d'établir que le demandeur [traduction] « serait arrêté, maltraité ou autrement ciblé » (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 8).
[27]
Selon le demandeur, l'agent a mal compris le fardeau de preuve applicable. À cet égard, le demandeur cite un extrait des motifs du juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 30:
Bien sûr, le simple emploi des mots « sera » ou « serait » n'est pas en soi suffisant pour conclure que l'agente a appliqué le mauvais critère juridique, en particulier s'il s'agit d'un cas isolé. Il faut tenir compte de la décision dans son ensemble, comme la Cour l'a clairement dit à plusieurs reprises: voir, par exemple,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . D'autre part, la simple énonciation, à la toute fin d'un examen, d'une formule type concernant le critère préliminaire à appliquer ne comble pas les lacunes constatées ailleurs dans les motifs.
Selon le demandeur, un fardeau de preuve erroné a été utilisé à de nombreuses reprises tout au long de la décision; il ne s'agissait donc pas d'un fait isolé.
[28]
Le demandeur allègue que s'il ressort de la décision que plus d'une norme a été appliquée ou qu'il est impossible d'établir clairement quelle norme a été appliquée, l'agent a commis une erreur (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). De l'avis du demandeur, si la Cour ne peut établir avec certitude si l'agent a bien compris le critère à utiliser, la décision devrait être annulée; il invoque à l'appui de cet argument
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[29]
Après l'audience, le demandeur a transmis à la Cour une décision récente de la Cour suprême du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et insiste pour que la Cour adopte le raisonnement qui y figure aux paragraphes 84 à 87.
Le caractère raisonnable de la décision
[30]
Le demandeur soutient que l'agent a évalué les documents de façon sélective et qu'il n'a pas tenu compte de certains éléments de preuve. Par exemple, dans son évaluation du document LKA103815.EF, l'agent s'est concentré sur la capacité du demandeur de réintégrer la société dans son pays d'origine, mais il n'a pas tenu compte de la portion du document dans laquelle il était indiqué que les citoyens de retour pourraient être détenus, torturés et gardés dans des conditions « très mauvaises » au moment de leur arrivée.
[31]
Le demandeur allègue qu'en ne tenant pas compte de certains éléments de preuve, l'agent n'a pas correctement examiné la question de la persécution cumulative. À ce sujet, le juge O'Keefe a écrit ce qui suit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], aux paragraphes 23 à 28:
La Cour d'appel fédérale et la Cour ont toutes les deux conclu qu'une série d'incidents de discrimination qui ne constituent pas de la persécution lorsqu'ils sont examinés individuellement peuvent équivaloir à de la persécution lorsqu'ils sont examinés cumulativement (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Le défendeur soutient que, lorsque l'agent a traité la demande d'ERAR, celui-ci avait seulement conclu qu'il y avait une preuve suffisante pour étayer le risque que le demandeur puisse faire l'objet d'extorsion à l'aéroport et que ce seul fait ne peut constituer une persécution cumulative.
Je conclus que l'agent avait omis de tenir compte de la persécution cumulative. À titre d'exemple, l'agent avait reconnu dans la décision relative à la demande CH que le demandeur pourrait devoir s'enregistrer auprès de la police et être interrogé par les agences de sécurité de l'État s'il désirait élire domicile à Colombo, ou devoir passer par des points de contrôle et s'enregistrer auprès de la police s'il désirait s'établir à Jaffna.
Ces conclusions de fait ne figuraient pas dans la décision d'ERAR. Puisque les deux décisions ont été rendues la même journée par le même agent, ces conclusions auraient dû faire partie de la décision d'ERAR et l'agent aurait dû examiner la question de savoir si le demandeur était exposé à plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution en raison de ces gestes discriminatoires.
Je ne peux pas savoir si l'agent aurait conclu, dans l'analyse quant à l'ERAR, qu'il pouvait y avoir persécution cumulative s'il avait tenu compte de tous les autres incidents de discrimination.
Par conséquent, compte tenu des erreurs de droit susmentionnées, je dois accueillir la demande de contrôle judiciaire portant sur la demande d'ERAR et la demande CH. Si l'ERAR est entaché d'une erreur, il faut en venir à la même conclusion pour la décision relative à la demande CH.
Selon le demandeur, il ressort de la décision en cause que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte de façon appropriée de la question de la persécution cumulative.
[32]
Le demandeur allègue que l'agent a commis une erreur en estimant que ce risque aurait dû être mentionné devant la SPR, mais il reconnaît que l'agent a évalué la nouvelle allégation relative au risque.
L'insuffisance des motifs
[33]
Le demandeur ajoute que les motifs de l'agent étaient inadéquats. En effet, l'agent a estimé que le demandeur pouvait être exposé à de la discrimination, mais il a conclu que cette discrimination n'équivaudrait pas à de la persécution, sans toutefois donner d'explications. Le demandeur soutient que l'insuffisance des motifs vient renforcer le caractère déraisonnable de la décision.
Le défendeur
Le critère approprié
[34]
Le défendeur souligne que le demandeur a reconnu que l'agent avait bien énoncé le critère. Les motifs pris dans leur ensemble démontrent que le bon critère a été appliqué. Contrairement à ce qu'allègue le demandeur, il n'est pas mentionné explicitement ou implicitement dans la décision que cette dernière était fondée sur la prépondérance des probabilités.
Le caractère raisonnable de la décision
[35]
Le défendeur souligne que le demandeur n'a pas présenté d'éléments de preuve personnalisés pour étayer l'allégation selon laquelle son profil correspond à celui qui est décrit dans la preuve à caractère général. Voici une des conclusions tirées par le juge de Montigny au paragraphe 25 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « En l'absence de preuve démontrant un risque personnalisé, la situation ayant cours dans un pays n'est pas suffisante pour obtenir une décision d'ERAR favorable » (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[36]
Le défendeur souligne qu'il incombe au demandeur d'établir un lien entre la situation dans le pays et sa situation personnelle; or, en l'espèce, il n'a pas réussi à le faire. L'agent a tenu compte des éléments de preuve objectifs soumis au sujet de la situation au Sri Lanka, mais il incombait au demandeur de fournir des éléments de preuve démontrant qu'il serait personnellement exposé aux risques allégués (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 29).
[37]
L'agent a pris en note le fait que la situation au Sri Lanka était difficile, mais il a établi avec raison que ce seul fait ne suffisait pas à démontrer que le demandeur serait exposé personnellement aux risques allégués. Par exemple, l'agent a souligné que, selon la preuve objective, les gens qui sortent du Sri Lanka de façon non autorisée peuvent éprouver des difficultés à leur retour, mais que, comme le demandeur avait quitté le pays muni de son propre passeport et de façon tout à fait légale, rien ne prouvait qu'il s'agissait d'un risque auquel le demandeur lui-même serait exposé.
[38]
La preuve objective révélait aussi que les personnes soupçonnées d'avoir des liens avec les TLET ou de posséder des antécédents d'opposition au gouvernement ou qui étaient visées par des accusations à caractère criminel risquaient l'arrestation ou la détention à leur l'arrivée au Sri Lanka. Selon l'agent, la preuve ne révélait pas que les demandeurs d'asile déboutés ou les Tamouls de sexe masculin provenant du Nord du pays étaient de façon générale considérés comme des personnes ayant des liens avec les TLET; de plus, le demandeur n'avait pas fourni d'éléments de preuve susceptibles de démontrer qu'il serait considéré comme une personne ayant des liens avec les TLET ou une personne visée par des accusations à caractère criminel. L'agent a aussi souligné que le frère du demandeur, âgé de 18 ans, qui vit à Jaffna - donc une personne dans une situation semblable à la sienne, n'avait jamais été soumis à de mauvais traitements. La conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle le demandeur n'avait pas établi que son profil correspondait à celui des personnes exposées à des risques décrits dans la preuve documentaire était raisonnable.
[39]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il n'était pas nécessaire que l'agent tire une conclusion explicite à l'égard de la persécution cumulative; en effet, la question de savoir si les expériences antérieures du demandeur équivalaient à de la persécution n'est pas pertinente en l'espèce. La façon appropriée de procéder dans le traitement d'une allégation de persécution cumulative consiste à évaluer l'effet cumulatif des incidents antérieurs que le demandeur a vécus (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 33). En l'espèce, la SPR avait déjà établi que les déclarations du demandeur relatives à des incidents antérieurs qui seraient survenus au Sri Lanka n'étaient pas crédibles. Il ne revenait pas à l'agent de remettre en question cette conclusion.
[40]
Le défendeur affirme que les faits visés par la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, invoquée par le demandeur, ne sont pas les mêmes que les faits de l'espèce. En effet, dans cette affaire, l'agent avait reconnu l'existence de certains risques mentionnés dans la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire déposée par le demandeur, mais non dans la demande d'ERAR. Si tous les risques avaient été reconnus dans la demande d'ERAR, leur cumul aurait pu être assimilé à de la persécution. En l'espèce, le demandeur n'a tout simplement pas établi l'existence des risques allégués. Il n'a pas réussi à faire la preuve de l'existence d'un lien entre sa situation personnelle et la situation des Tamouls de retour au Sri Lanka; par conséquent, il n'est pas possible de dire que l'agent a déraisonnablement omis de tenir compte de la question de la persécution cumulative.
[41]
Le demandeur reconnaît que l'agent a apprécié les nouveaux risques mentionnés par le demandeur; il est donc évident que l'agent, avant de rendre sa décision, n'a pas cherché à savoir si ces allégations d'exposition à des risques auraient pu être présentées à la SPR. Les motifs de l'agent démontrent qu'il a tenu compte de l'ensemble des éléments de preuve et des observations du demandeur en ce qui concerne l'exposition à des risques (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), mais qu'il est parvenu à la conclusion que tous ces éléments n'étaient pas suffisants pour établir l'existence des risques allégués. Le défendeur soutient que l'agent a eu recours au bon fardeau de preuve et que la décision est raisonnable.
ANALYSE
[42]
Le demandeur affirme que [traduction] « l'agent d'ERAR a commis une erreur notamment parce que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré
selon la prépondérance des probabilités
qu'il pourrait subir des préjudices » [non souligné dans l'original]. Selon cette affirmation, le demandeur a été soumis, dans la démonstration du bien-fondé de sa demande de protection, à un fardeau de preuve plus lourd que celui qui est exigé par la loi.
[43]
En effet, dans sa décision, l'agent n'a jamais affirmé que le fardeau de preuve qui incombe au demandeur est celui de la [traduction] « prépondérance des probabilités » en ce qui concerne l'existence d'un risque de persécution au sens de l'article 96. En fait, l'agent précise clairement dans le sommaire de la décision qu'il incombe au demandeur de démontrer que l'existence d'une persécution au sens de l'article 96 est [traduction] « plus qu'une simple possibilité » et qu'[traduction] « il est plus probable que le contraire qu'il soit exposé au risque d'être soumis à la torture, à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités » au sens de l'article 97.
[44]
Le demandeur reconnaît que l'agent énonce correctement le critère dans le sommaire. Il s'agit d'établir si, dans d'autres passages de la décision, l'agent applique un autre critère. La jurisprudence établit clairement que, pour trancher cette question, « [i] l faut tenir compte de la décision dans son ensemble » (voir la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée).
[45] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Sinnasamy
, soit la décision sur laquelle s'est appuyé le demandeur, la Cour a estimé que cette question semblait « se situer à la limite » et que « [s] i l'agente n'avait pas commis d'autres erreurs susceptibles de contrôle », la Cour ne pensait pas que cela suffirait pour annuler sa décision.
[46]
Le droit dans ce domaine a été révisé récemment par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 25 et 29 à 32:
J'estime que SPR n'a pas énoncé et appliqué clairement le critère juridique devant présider à l'examen de la demande d'asile fondée sur l'article 96 soumise par le demandeur. Dans
Mugadza
, j'ai indiqué aux paragraphes 20 à 22:
[20] Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour d'appel fédérale s'est penchée sur le critère juridique ou la norme de preuve à laquelle doit satisfaire un demandeur d'asile qui invoque la crainte d'être persécuté. Le juge MacGuigan, s'interrogeant sur l'interprétation qu'il fallait donner à « réfugié au sens de la Convention » apparaissant à l'article 2(1)
a
) de l'ancienne
Loi sur l'immigration
, la disposition qui a précédé l'alinéa 96
a
) de la LIPR, a déclaré ce qui suit:
Cependant, la question soulevée auprès de cette Cour portait plutôt sur le bien-fondé de la crainte subjective, l'élément dit objectif, qui veut que la crainte du réfugié soit appréciée objectivement pour déterminer si elle s'appuie sur des motifs valables.
Il n'est pas contesté que le critère objectif ne va pas jusqu'à exiger qu'il y ait probabilité de persécution. En d'autres termes, bien que le requérant soit tenu d'établir ses prétentions selon la prépondérance des probabilités, il n'a tout de même pas à prouver qu'il serait plus probable qu'il soit persécuté que le contraire. En effet, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.), à la page 437, le juge Heald, de la Section d'appel, a dit ce qui suit:
Par conséquent, j'estime que la Commission a commis une erreur en exigeant que le requérant et son épouse démontrent qu'ils seraient persécutés alors que la définition légale précitée exige seulement qu'ils établissent qu'ils « craignent avec raison d'être persécutés ». Le critère imposé par la Commission est plus rigoureux que celui qu'impose la loi.
[...]
Nous adopterions cette formulation, qui nous semble équivalente à celle utilisée par le juge Pratte, de la Section d'appel, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  conclusion qu'un requérant est un réfugié au sens de la Convention, il n'est pas nécessaire de prouver qu'il « avait été ou serait l'objet de mesures de persécution »; ce que la preuve doit indiquer est que le requérant craint avec raison d'être persécuté pour l'une des raisons énoncées dans la Loi.
Les expressions telles que « [craint] avec raison » et « possibilité raisonnable » signifient d'une part qu'il n'y a pas à y avoir une possibilité supérieure à 50 % (c'est-à-dire une probabilité), et d'autre part, qu'il doit exister davantage qu'une possibilité minime. Nous croyons qu'on pourrait aussi parler de possibilité « raisonnable » ou même de « possibilité sérieuse », par opposition à une simple possibilité.
[21] Les motifs de la Commission doivent être pris dans leur ensemble. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Lemieux, se prononçant sur la question de savoir si la Commission avait commis une erreur dans son application du critère de l'article 96 en énonçant deux critères quelque peu différents, a conclu comme suit:
En l'espèce, compte tenu de la décision contestée dans son ensemble, je conclus que le tribunal s'est suffisamment exprimé et que le fardeau de la preuve imposé aux demandeurs n'était pas excessif. Le tribunal exprime l'essence de la norme de preuve appropriée, à savoir [...]
[22] La décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge O'Reilly a déclaré ce qui suit:
La norme de preuve n'est pas facile à énoncer. La Cour fédérale a reconnu que différentes expressions de cette norme sont acceptables, pour autant qu'il appert de l'ensemble des motifs de la Commission que le fardeau de la preuve imposé au demandeur n'est pas excessif.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Rennie a indiqué, au paragraphe 5:
Quant à la seconde erreur, la demanderesse a déclaré avoir été enlevée et battue par les FARC. La SPR a insisté sur la « preuve absolue » de cette allégation.
La SPR a également rejeté la prétention de Mme Alvarez parce qu'elle croyait, « selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'elle n'était pas une cible des FARC ». Aucune de ces conclusions ne repose sur la norme juridique applicable. Il n'incombait pas à la demanderesse principale de produire une preuve concluante ou une preuve selon la prépondérance des probabilités. Le critère consiste à déterminer s'il existe une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ou de préjudice
. Comme l'a rappelé le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 4, lorsque la Commission a rehaussé à tort la norme de preuve, ou que la Cour ne peut déterminer la norme de preuve qui a été effectivement appliquée, la tenue d'une nouvelle audience peut être ordonnée; voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Il s'agit donc là aussi d'une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[Je souligne.]
...
Bien que la SPR doive examiner les faits invoqués pour fonder une crainte subjective fondée de persécution, elle ne peut se mettre à la place du demandeur et appliquer la norme civile de prépondérance des probabilités pour établir si la crainte subjective est fondée ou non. En le faisant, elle a imposé à tort une norme plus exigeante.
La conclusion qu'elle formule au paragraphe 43 de sa décision constitue un exemple supplémentaire d'application d'une mauvaise norme de preuve:
Pour ces motifs,
le tribunal conclut que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le gouvernement du Sri Lanka ne souhaite pas arrêter le demandeur d'asile et ne le perçoit pas comme une personne ayant des liens avec les TLET
, même s'il est un jeune Tamoul des régions du nord et de l'est du Sri Lanka.
[Je souligne.]
La SPR mentionne cependant le bon critère dans deux paragraphes de sa décision:
... le tribunal conclut qu'il n'y a pas de possibilité sérieuse que le demandeur d'asile soit persécuté à son retour au Sri Lanka et que sa crainte n'est pas fondée.
[Dossier certifié du tribunal - décision de la SPR, para 63]
Comme le demandeur d'asile n'a présenté aucun autre élément de preuve, et que la documentation n'appuie pas une conclusion selon laquelle il y aurait une possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit persécuté s'il retournait au Sri Lanka ou qu'il serait persécuté ou personnellement exposé à une menace à sa vie, au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités, ou au risque d'être soumis à la torture par les autorités du Sri Lanka, la demande d'asile doit être rejetée. [Dossier certifié du tribunal - décision de la SPR, para 68]
J'estime toutefois que ces passages ne peuvent sauver la décision, la SPR ayant, au mieux, appliqué des normes de preuve disparates dans son analyse relative à l'article 96.
[47]
De plus, voici à ce sujet les paragraphes 7 à 9 des motifs de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> citée par le juge Mandamin:
En revanche, dans les cas où la Commission a semblé imposer un fardeau de la preuve excessif au demandeur, la Cour a ordonné la tenue d'une nouvelle audience. Ainsi, le juge en chef Julius Isaac a conclu que la Commission avait commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a mentionné qu'elle n'était pas convaincue « [que le demandeur] court un risque raisonnable d'être persécuté en raison de ses opinions politiques s'il retourne en Bulgarie » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (QL); voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (QL)). Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , susmentionné, le juge MacGuigan n'a pas approuvé la façon dont la Commission avait formulé la norme de preuve en disant que les éléments de preuve qui lui avaient été présentés « ne lui permettent pas de conclure qu'il y a des raisons suffisantes de penser que M. Adjei serait persécuté... ».
Ce qu'il faut retenir de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , c'est que la norme de preuve applicable réunit la norme civile habituelle et un seuil spécial qui s'applique uniquement dans le contexte des demandes d'asile. Bien entendu, les demandeurs doivent prouver les faits sur lesquels ils se fondent et la norme de preuve civile constitue la bonne façon d'apprécier la preuve qu'ils présentent à l'appui de leurs assertions de fait. Dans la même veine, les demandeurs doivent convaincre la Commission en bout de ligne qu'ils risquent d'être persécutés. Il s'agit encore là d'une norme de preuve civile. Cependant, étant donné qu'ils doivent démontrer uniquement l'existence d'un risque de persécution, il ne convient pas d'exiger d'eux qu'ils prouvent que la persécution est probable. En conséquence, ils doivent simplement prouver qu'il existe « une possibilité raisonnable », « davantage qu'une possibilité minime » ou « de bonnes raisons de croire » qu'ils seront persécutés.
Il appert des décisions susmentionnées que, lorsque la Commission a articulé l'essentiel de la norme de preuve applicable (c'est-à-dire la combinaison de la norme de preuve civile et du concept de la « possibilité raisonnable »), la Cour fédérale n'est pas intervenue. En revanche, dans les cas où il a semblé que la Commission avait rehaussé la norme de preuve, la Cour est passée à un examen où elle s'est demandé si une nouvelle audience était nécessaire. De plus, si la Cour ne peut déterminer la norme de preuve qui a été appliquée, une nouvelle audience sera peut-être nécessaire:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 1613 (QL).
[48]
Voici les détails de la plainte du demandeur en l'espèce:
[traduction]
7. L'agent d'ERAR a commis une erreur notamment parce que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré selon la prépondérance des probabilités qu'il serait soumis à des difficultés. Voir le dossier, page 12 (le demandeur n'a pas démontré que son profil en est un qui « attirerait » une attention indue ou des représailles (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 6); page 13: le demandeur n'a pas démontré qu'il « serait perçu » comme une personne qui avait quitté le pays illégalement; qu'il « serait détenu » à son retour; page 14: le demandeur n'a pas démontré qu'il « serait perçu » comme une personne ayant des liens avec les TLTE ou possédant des antécédents d'opposition au gouvernement; page 14: le demandeur n'a pas démontré qu'il « serait arrêté, maltraité ou autrement ciblé ». Il ne s'agit pas d'événements isolés (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-après).
8. Le demandeur n'avait pas le fardeau ultime de prouver qu'il risquait d'être persécuté. L'agent d'ERAR ne devait pas se contenter de chercher à savoir si le demandeur
serait
persécuté, mais établir s'il existait plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution. Le demandeur [
sic
] que la norme de preuve prévue par l'art. 96 de la LIPR est moins exigeante que la prépondérance des probabilités, mais plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution au retour (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C. A.) (QL)).
[49]
Le défendeur soutient que, à chacune de ces occasions, l'agent ne fait qu'appliquer la norme de preuve de droit civil aux faits sur lesquels le demandeur cherche à s'appuyer afin d'établir le bien-fondé de sa crainte de persécution au sens de l'article 96 ou de sa crainte d'être exposé à des risques au sens de l'article 97. À mon avis, pour examiner et trancher cette question, il faut prendre en compte les faits particuliers de chaque espèce et la décision doit être examinée dans son ensemble, de façon à établir si la mauvaise norme de preuve a été appliquée. Je ne peux simplement adopter le raisonnement suivi dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, comme me presse de le faire le demandeur. À mon avis, il existe des différences factuelles et sémantiques importantes entre les faits dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et les faits de l'espèce. De plus, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le problème concernait un renversement du fardeau de la preuve, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'espèce. Selon ma lecture de l'ensemble de la décision, j'estime que la SPR a exigé du demandeur qu'il démontre les faits sur lesquels il s'appuyait (c.-à-d. son profil) selon la prépondérance des probabilités, mais la SPR a appliqué la norme appropriée (mentionnée dans la décision) en établissant si ces faits liés au profil du demandeur faisaient en sorte que ce dernier était exposé au risque d'être persécuté. Par conséquent, je ne peux accepter les arguments du demandeur selon lesquels la décision contient une erreur susceptible de révision.
[50]
J'estime que le demandeur cite hors contexte certains extraits de la décision d'ERAR. Voici ce que révèlent les passages cités par le demandeur lorsqu'ils sont replacés dans leur contexte:
a. De façon générale, [traduction] « les nouveaux éléments de preuve ne permettent pas d'établir que le demandeur est exposé à de nouveaux risques ou que le profil du demandeur en était un qui attirerait une attention indue ou des représailles de la part d'organisations militantes ou des forces de sécurité s'il était renvoyé au Sri Lanka ». En d'autres termes, le demandeur n'a pas fourni d'éléments de preuve attestant l'existence de nouveaux risques ou l'existence du profil d'une personne exposée à des risques. Il s'agit d'un commentaire sur l'absence d'éléments de preuve pertinents; par contre, il ne s'agit pas d'un énoncé sur le fardeau de preuve dont le demandeur doit s'acquitter pour établir l'existence d'un risque en vertu de l'article 96 de la Loi.
b. La SPR a conclu que le demandeur [traduction] « n'[avait] pas démontré qu'il avait quitté le Sri Lanka illégalement » ou qu'il serait perçu comme une personne qui avait quitté le pays illégalement. Encore une fois, c'est là un commentaire au sujet de l'absence d'éléments de preuve attestant un risque évoqué par le demandeur. Il n'est pas question du fardeau de preuve aux termes de l'article 96 de la Loi. De plus, la SPR poursuit en soulignant que [traduction] « le demandeur n'a pas expliqué de façon satisfaisante pour quelles raisons il serait détenu à son retour au Sri Lanka compte tenu de la conclusion du tribunal de la SPR selon laquelle il avait été autorisé à quitter son pays ». C'est tout simplement une autre façon de dire que le demandeur ne disposait pas d'éléments de preuve pour étayer son allégation selon laquelle il serait détenu. Il ne s'agit donc pas du fardeau de preuve prévu à l'article 96 de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  nouveaux éléments de preuve convaincants qu'il serait perçu comme une personne ayant des liens avec les TLTE ou possédant des antécédents d'opposition au gouvernement ». Encore une fois, à mon avis, c'est un commentaire relatif aux lacunes des nouveaux éléments de preuve soumis par le demandeur. Il ne s'agit pas d'une déclaration au sujet du degré de risque dont il doit faire la preuve en vertu de l'article 96 de la Loi. La même chose s'applique aux commentaires de la SPR selon lesquels les documents soumis par le demandeur ne permettent pas à la SPR de conclure qu'il [traduction] « serait arrêté, maltraité ou autrement ciblé comme une personne soupçonnée d'avoir des liens avec les TLET parce qu'il est un demandeur débouté, parce qu'il est un Tamoul du Nord du pays ou pour tout autre motif qui justifierait une décision positive en l'espèce ». À mon avis, la SPR dit simplement qu'il n'existe aucun élément de preuve satisfaisant pour étayer l'existence des risques allégués par le demandeur. Il ne s'agit pas d'un commentaire sur le degré de risque auquel le demandeur doit démontrer qu'il est exposé.
d. La SPR réitère que [traduction] « le demandeur n'a pas établi au moyen de nouveaux éléments de preuve suffisants que son profil personnel justifie une décision positive en l'espèce ». La SPR poursuit en soulignant qu'elle juge aussi que [traduction] « les nouveaux éléments de preuve ne [la] convainquent pas que la situation dans le pays s'est détériorée depuis le rejet de la demande par la SPR ou que la situation personnelle du demandeur a changé au point de justifier une conclusion selon laquelle il est exposé à des risques ». En d'autres mots, le demandeur n'a pas fourni la preuve que son profil est celui d'une personne exposée à des risques.
[51]
Après avoir évalué la qualité des nouveaux éléments de preuve fournis par le demandeur, la SPR applique ensuite le critère établi en ce qui concerne le degré de risque et conclut que le demandeur [traduction] « n'est exposé qu'à une simple possibilité de persécution au Sri Lanka ... ». La lecture complète des extraits cités de la SPR dans leur contexte ne me convainc pas que la SPR a exigé un fardeau de preuve plus élevé que celui qui est exigé par la loi.
[52]
À mon avis, la SPR n'a pas appliqué un critère erroné, la décision est raisonnable et les motifs sont adéquats.
[53]
Les avocats conviennent qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier, et la Cour est d'accord.
JUGEMENT
[54]
LA COUR REND LE JUGEMENT suivant
:
1. La demande est rejetée.
2. Il n'y a aucune question à certifier.
3. L'intitulé est modifié par la suppression de « ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile », de sorte qu'il n'y a qu'un seul défendeur, le ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration.
