Walsh, J.
: Applicants move for:
(a) leave to commence an application for an interim order of prohibition or for an interim stay of the inquiry, prohibiting the Employment and Immigration Commission and the immigration adjudicator from holding the inquiry concerning the applicant, Lenford Smith, such inquiry now scheduled to commence on November 9, 1992;
(b) if leave is granted, for an interim order of prohibition or for an interim stay of the inquiry made pursuant to s. 18.2 of the
Federal Court Act
or pursuant to ancillary powers of the court;
(c) in the alternative, an interim order pursuant to s. 24(1) of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
prohibiting the Employment and Immigration and the immigration adjudicator from holding the inquiry concerning the applicant, Lenford Smith, such inquiry now being scheduled to commence on July 10, 1992. (This is obviously an erroneous date.)
[2]
This Motion was filed on October 28, 1992 for hearing on November 2, 1992. On September 29, 1992 the application for leave to commence an application pursuant to s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
was filed seeking an order of prohibition pursuant to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
prohibiting the Minister from continuing an immigration inquiry concerning applicant Lenford Smith, an order of certiorari quashing the decision of immigration officials dated August 21, 1992 communicated to applicants on September 14, 1992 determining that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to allow applicant to apply for landing from within Canada, and an order of mandamus requiring respondents to conduct a new determination into the application on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in accordance with principles of natural and fundamental justice and in accordance with the Immigration Manual which requires that a determination be made into the bona fides of the marriage between applicants. This was supported by an affidavit of Marissa Beata Bielshi and affidavits of applicants. This supporting material was only filed on October 28, 1992.
Facts
[3]
Applicant Ann Smith, a Canadian, met Lenford Smith in the summer of 1989 at which time she had commenced divorce proceedings from her former husband and had a ten month old child from a previous relationship. Some months later he moved in with her and assisted in raising this child, Courtney, who calls him "Dad". Her divorce was obtained on September 2, 1990 and they were married on September 20. In May of 1991 they had a child, Trevor, and in September 1992 a second child, Natasha. The three children are said to be very attached to the applicant Lenford Smith, who is the father of the two youngest.
[4]
In August of 1991, the applicants had a marital dispute and applicant Ann Smith informed immigration that Lenford was working illegally. However, it was she who posted bail to get him released from detention and they are still living happily together and in fact had the second child of the marriage in September 1992.
[5]
They had a marriage interview with an immigration officer in March 1992. It was not until September 14, 1992 that applicant Lenford Smith's counsel received a letter dated August 26, 1992 advising that "no humanitarian and compassionate grounds have been identified to warrant processing this case from within Canada" and that the inquiry would therefore be scheduled for September 21, 1992. This inquiry was eventually postponed to November 9, 1992, and at the hearing of the Motion before the court on November 9, it was agreed that it would not take place until November 26.
[6]
In the event that the inquiry should result in Lenford Smith being ordered to leave Canada, which is likely, since he is here illegally, and a deportation order is issued, he would require Ministerial consent to return and in any event experience indicates that an application by him for permanent residence from Jamaica will take several years to process.
[7]
These facts and submissions are derived from the aforementioned affidavits filed in support of the s. 18.1 application for leave to appeal, and, as is frequently the case must be considered in adjudicating the Motion before the court seeking prohibition to stay the s. 27 inquiry. At the hearing on short notice of the application respondent had not yet had time to file necessary affidavits, but they now have been received.
[8]
The two affidavits of Tina Toritto and Rita Pasqualitto, both with the Department at the Mississauga Hearings Canada Immigration Centre are couched in almost identical terms respecting the humanitarian and compassionate hearing and the reasons for refusal to grant the application. Both even make the same fundamental error as to dates of an alleged assault by Lenford Smith on his wife on August 28, 1992 and her telephone call to the Investigation Branch on August 29, 1992, whereas the marriage interview took place in March 1992, and the letter advising of the adverse decision is dated July 17, 1992 (Identical letter to counsel August 26, 1992). Discussion at the interview was with respect to the marital dispute between the parties in August 1991 following which she allegedly reported him as being illegally in Canada. She posted bail for him and claims they are now living happily together again in Canada and, as stated, now have had another child together born in September 1992.
Arguments And Conclusions In Law
[9]
It is trite law to state that each case must be decided on its own facts. Much of the jurisprudence to which the court was referred in this matter concerned refugee claims appeals from adverse decisions which had been made. In the present case what is sought to be prohibited is the holding of a hearing by virtue of which pursuant to s. 27 Lenford Smith will almost certainly be required to leave Canada, whether by removal order or deportation notice.
[10]
In the present case no sponsorship application has yet been made by applicant Ann Smith and in any event, even if made would not have been decided before the date set for the deportation inquiry of Lenford Smith. That inquiry is of course entirely separate from the humanitarian and compassionate review inquiry pursuant to s. 114(2) of the
Act
which has now been decided adversely to applicant Lenford Smith by letter dated July 17, 1992.
[11]
What has been made, however, and not yet decided is an application for judicial review quashing the decision made to the effect that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to allow applicant Lenford Smith to apply for landing within Canada.
[12]
With respect to the jurisdiction of this court to order a stay, MacKay, J., in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , although dealing with a case in which a deportation notice had already been issued, stated: "it is my view that this court has inherent jurisdiction to grant a stay where action by one party may render nugatory relief sought from this court by another party. Moreover, by s. 18.2 of the
Federal Court Act
in force as of February 1, 1992, the court has jurisdiction to grant interim orders on an application for judicial review, pending final disposition of the application. That provision, in my view, warrants interpretation that encompasses the authority to grant an interim stay pending final disposition of an application for leave to commence proceedings seeking judicial review; and if leave be granted, pending disposition of the judicial review proceedings. The application in this case is clearly one interrelated with the application for leave to commence proceedings for judicial review under s. 18.1 of the
Act
."
[13]
Deportations resulting from Orders made pursuant to s. 27 of the
Act
are required by law to be carried out promptly and this should not lightly be interfered with. Respondent suggests that this Motion is premature as no such Order has yet been made. Undoubtedly if the hearing took place and such an Order were made, applicant Lenford Smith would then apply for a stay of it. This would merely duplicate and repeat the arguments made at this hearing and I can see no advantage in awaiting a decision on the s. 27 hearing, rather than dealing with the issue on the present Motion. Moreover, there are certain advantages for an applicant in attempting to prevent such an Order from being made. At the hearing an applicant can seek a departure notice rather than a removal order, but it would be inconsistent for an applicant who wishes to remain in Canada to seek a departure notice to leave voluntarily, with no assurance as to when or from where he will be allowed to return.
[14]
In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , MacKay, J., stated:
"I note that whether or not there be a statutory requirement for humanitarian and compassionate review of the applicant's case before deportation, where submissions concerning such considerations are made the Minister has an obligation to consider these (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In the discharge of that obligation the respondent must act in accord with the duty of fairness applicable by the common law and under the
Charter
, (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.))."
[15]
Although on the facts Justice MacKay, after distinguishing the appeal court case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), which had granted a stay, refused same in the action before him, finding that the balance of convenience was in favour of respondent.
[16]
The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra, a decision of A.C.J. Jerome is frequently quoted. After stating at p. 739 that the discretion afforded an immigration officer by s. 114(2) of the
Act
is wide he points out that since neither the
Act
nor
Regulations
set out in detail how the policy is to be applied it is not surprising that the
Immigration Manual
contains in Chapter 9 policy guidelines to assist the officer. Under the heading "Exercise of Discretionary Powers" it is said:
"It is important that officers realize that these guidelines are not intended as hard and fast rules. They will not answer all eventualities, nor can they be framed to do so. Officers are expected to consider carefully all aspects of cases, use their best judgment and make the appropriate recommendations."
[17]
The judgment goes on to state that "problems with spouses, family dependency, difficulties with return to country of origin, illegal de facto residents and situations involving marriage breakdowns" should be assessed and notes that the chapter concludes:
"Humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist when unusual undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be caused to a person seeking consideration or to persons in Canada with whom the immigrant is associated, if he were not allowed to remain in Canada while his request for landing is in process."
[18]
In dealing with the issue of "fettering" the officer's discretion by policy directives, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> judgment refers with approval to the Statement of Professor Evans in de Smith's
Judicial Review of Administrative Action
(4th Ed.), p. 312 where he states:
"A factor that may properly be taken into account in exercising a discretion may become an unlawful fetter upon discretion if it is elevated to the status of a general rule that results in the pursuit of consistency at the expense of the merits of individual cases."
[19]
The
Immigration Manual
I.E. 9 under the heading "Public Policy Situation" 9.06(2) - Spousal Policy states:
"Requests for visa exemptions made by spouses of Canadian residents will be sympathetically examined bearing in mind that separation of spouses in genuine marriages entails hardships which normally warrants the exercise of special relief ... In the case of a genuine marriage, that is, a marriage of substance and of likely duration that has been entered into in good faith, and not merely for immigration purposes, it is not necessary for the persons concerned to prove additional hardships in order for a request for relief from A9(1) to be processed."
[20]
Lenford Smith's counsel wrote to the Department on August 12 and August 20 with reference to the refusal letter of July 17 making further submissions on behalf of his client and insisting that the marriage was bona fide and the serious consequences which would result to Mrs. Smith who would not be able to return to work after the birth of her baby, if her husband was deported. Moreover, he has lost all contact with his relatives in Jamaica and has no one to return to there. No reply was received until the letter of August 26 again confirming the refusal to process the matter in Canada.
[21]
No reference is made in this letter nor in the identical initial letter of July 17, 1992 to the fact that the refusal was based on a conclusion that the marriage was not bona fide, the first reference to this being in the affidavit of Tina Toritto of November 9. It is common ground however that this was the reason, although no explanation for the refusal was given. Counsel argues that this constitutes a breach of natural justice.
[22]
Turning now to the matter which must be considered, pursuant to the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra, in order to grant the relief sought in this Motion, it is clear that there is a serious issue to be decided on the application for leave to review, both on the question of whether the marriage was bona fide or not and on the conclusion that the matter could not be processed from within Canada. Without in any way deciding these issues, since I have concluded that the application for leave should be dealt with elsewhere after full consideration and argument on it, I nevertheless note that the marriage has ever indicia of a bona fide marriage and not merely one of convenience to circumvent the law and obtain landed status for an immigrant not otherwise entitled to it. The wedding was attended by a large number of guests, and took place as soon as the wife Ann Smith was free to do so following divorce from a previous marriage. Two children have been born of the marriage and are living with the spouses as well as her child from a former relationship. The fact that at one time Lenford Smith used another name may rouse certain suspicions as to his character, which remain unexplained, but does not affect the validity of the marriage. The conduct of Ann Smith prior to meeting and marrying Lenford Smith may be pertinent, but does not appear to be a decisive factor. The fact that they quarrelled at one time after the marriage resulting in her laying charges against him, but later became reconciled even before the birth of the youngest child, merely indicates that the marriage has not always been ideal nor happy nor is the conduct of Lenford Smith beyond criticism, but would not seem to justify a conclusion that the marriage was not bona fide. Many married couples quarrel, often violently, after marriage but this does not justify a conclusion that the marriage itself was not bona fide.
[23]
With respect to the conclusion that the matter cannot be processed in Canada, there is nothing in the law, regulations or even the
Immigration Manual
to this effect, but to the contrary the
Manual
itself and the Supreme Court case of
Jiminez- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , indicate that in appropriate circumstances this can be done. It is suggested by applicant's counsel that this finding is based on a matter of policy which has no legal basis.
[24]
For these reasons I conclude that there is a serious issue to be decided.
[25]
On the issue of irreparable harm little needs to be said. Applicants have three young children living with them, two of whom are children born of their marriage. Lenford Smith has no place to go in Jamaica now and if he were forced to leave the country, Ann Smith would be left to cope with the children herself and most likely be unable to work, having to go on welfare. The emotional and psychological effects on the children on losing their beloved father might be severe.
[26]
On the issue of balance of convenience it does not appear that the consequences of awaiting a decision on the application to seek a review of the adverse finding on the humanitarian and compassionate application, and if permission is granted to await the outcome of the review, before proceeding to a hearing seeking deportation pursuant to s. 27 would merely result in further delays for the respondent, whereas on the contrary if Lenford Smith were forced to leave the country this would be a major inconvenience for him and for his family. The balance of convenience is therefore in his favour.
[27]
In making a finding to accord a stay I am cognizant of what Madame Justice Reed stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.):
"What is in issue, however, when considering balance of convenience, is the extent to which the granting of stays might become a practice which thwarts the efficient operation of the immigration legislation. It is well known that the present procedures were put in place because a practice had grown up in which many cases, totally devoid of merit, were initiated in the court, indeed were clogging the court, for the sole purpose of buying the appellants further time in Canada. There is a public interest in having a system which operates in an efficient, expeditious and fair manner and which, to the greatest extent possible, does not lend itself to abusive practices. This is the public interest which in my view must be weighed against the potential harm to the applicant if a stay is not granted.
"I am not convinced that granting stays in all cases such as the present, where there is clearly an arguable case and where the whole foundation of the applicant's claim is based on the proposition that irreparable harm will occur to him if he is returned to the country from which he came, would so undercut the operation of the immigration system as to be detrimental to the public interest which exists in seeing that the system operates fairly and efficiently."
and of what Justice MacKay stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra:
"That public interest supports the maintenance of statutory programs and the efforts of those responsible for carrying them out. Only in exceptional cases will the individual's interest, which on the evidence is likely to suffer irreparable harm, outweigh the public interest." (See also A.C.J. Jerome in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .)"
[28]
While I share these concerns about the dangers of opening the doors to what is sometimes referred to as the "floodgate argument", I believe that on the exceptional facts of this case, administrative policy and even public interest should not be so rigidly applied as to place applicant Lenford Smith and the members of his family in a situation where irreparable harm may result. The Order sought will therefore be granted.
Application allowed.
