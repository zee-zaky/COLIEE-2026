Noël, J.
: By this motion applicants seek interim relief pursuant to s. 18.2 of the
Federal Court Act
. The motion is for:
"Interim Relief pursuant to s. 18.2 of the
Federal Court Act
prohibiting the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne from holding the election on April 24, 1993;
"An Interim Declaratory Order that the quorum for a meeting of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne is seven District Chiefs of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne with a minimum of two District Chiefs of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne from each of the three Akwesasne electoral districts or, in the alternative, a declaration that the quorum for a meeting of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne is seven District Chiefs of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne;
"An Interim Declaratory Order that the Grand Chief of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne does not qualify for the purpose of establishing quorum;
"the costs of this motion on a solicitor and client basis."
[2]
At the onset, I should state that I do not believe that it would be appropriate for this court to grant the interim declaratory order sought by the applicants. A declaration as to the state of the law regarding quorum for the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne would, by its nature, be final, and I do not believe that such a declaration can properly be made in the context of a motion for interim relief. (See: Hogg, P.W.,
Liability of the Crown
(2nd Ed. 1989), at pp. 20-22.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), affirmed [1984] 2 S.C.R. 124; 53 N.R. 394 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 183 (T.D.)) The motion for the two interim declaratory orders is accordingly dismissed.
[3]
This leaves me with the motion seeking an interim order prohibiting the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne from holding the election scheduled to take place on April 24, 1993.
Background
[4]
These elections, which in fact are by-elections, are being held pursuant to a resolution adopted at a general meeting of Council held on June 6, 1992. It received the unanimous sanction of all the District Chiefs. Mohawk Council Resolution 162 reads as follows:
"That should the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne continue to not work together after the vote of June 20, 1992 on the public status of Mike Mitchell another Binding Promise Vote will be set up within three months of that date. This vote will be binding on all 12 District Chiefs.
"This vote will take place in all three districts of Akwesasne on whether or not new elections for the 12 District Chiefs will take place."
(The "binding promise vote" refers to a binding referendum as to whether or not a by-election ought to be held.)
[5]
Since the inauguration of the present Council in June of 1991, there have been two factions on Council, dividing it between a majority faction composed of seven members and a minority faction composed of six members. This division has resulted in constant deadlocks which in turn have prevented the Council from dealing with the many issues facing the community. The applicants herein are the members of the Council who represent the minority faction.
[6]
Resolution 162 was passed with the view of resolving this impasse. Further to its passing, the situation failed to improve. By a further resolution dated February 10, 1993, it was resolved that a public vote would take place on February 20, 1993 to determine whether or not a by-election was to be held. A vote in favour of the holding of a by-election resulted. By resolution dated March 4, 1993, the decision to hold the election on April 24, 1993 was made. It is this last resolution which is the object of the applicants' original notice of motion.
[7]
In order to succeed, the applicants must establish that their attack on the decision of the Council to hold the by-election raises a serious issue, that the balance of convenience operates in favour of preventing the by-election from taking place, and that irreparable harm would result if the by-election was held prior to a determination being made as to its legality.
Serious Issue
[8]
The applicants raise a number of arguments in their attack on the decision of the Council to hold the by-election on April 24, 1993. The most serious attack, in my view, is based on the Akwesasne Election Regulation, and the fact that thereunder, Council members are elected for a three year term. Counsel argues that, in the absence of a resignation by a Council member or a removal in accordance with the Regulations, no by-elections can be held prior to the expiration of the three year term and the Akwesasne Election Regulation must govern the timing and manner of election.
[9]
While Resolution 162 could be construed as a conditional resignation of the Council members so as to give rise to a valid by-election, counsel for the applicants points out that, by its very terms, this resolution was effective only to the extent that it was acted upon by the calling and holding of a referendum within three months of June 20. As this was not done until February 20, 1993, counsel for the applicants concludes that Resolution 162 is not authority for the holding of the by-election, and that in the absence of a resignation by the Council members, there is, under the Akwesasne Election Regulation, no authority for the holding of elections before the expiration of the Council's three year term.
[10]
In response, counsel for the respondent argues that Resolution 162 should not be construed literally and that the understanding of the Council members and the community was that it was to remain in effect for the remainder of the three year term. He adds that when regard is had to the context in which the resolution was passed, it is clear that this was the intended result.
[11]
While that may be so and without in any way purporting to decide the question, I believe that a serious issue nevertheless arises as to whether Resolution 162 is proper authority for the holding of the by-election.
Balance Of Convenience/
Irreparable Harm
[12]
Given the questions that arise in this matter, the relevant considerations underlying an assessment of the balance of convenience and irreparable harm are essentially the same. In assessing the balance of convenience, the court must take account of the public interest which, in this instance, must be analyzed by reference to the needs and best interests of the Akwesasne community. The Council charged with the responsibility of governing that community is already in an uncertain and somewhat chaotic state which, in my view, must not be further exacerbated.
[13]
By granting an interim order prohibiting the holding of the by-election until the matter of its legality is resolved, I would, from the respondents' point of view, temporarily suspend the holding of validly called elections. On the other hand, by granting the interim order, I would preserve the status quo until the issue of the propriety of the by-election is determined. It seems to me that while the present state of affairs is obviously less than desirable, the one which would result if elections were held and were subsequently declared invalid, would be immeasurably worse.
[14]
The further disruption which would result in the Akwesasne community if elections, otherwise validly and democratically held, were voided because of an absence of proper authority to hold them could be substantial. Those elected in accordance with the perceived will of the people would be forced to abandon their seats on the Council in favour of members who no longer hold the trust of the community. This would add considerable difficulty to an already difficult situation.
[15]
In contrast, preventing the holding of the election until its legality is confirmed would prevent the immediate resolution of the impasse without, however, adding any more fuel to the fire.
[16]
In these circumstances, I believe that it is incumbent upon me to preserve the status quo until the matter of the legitimacy of the by-election is determined and to grant the interim order sought by the applicants.
[17]
Counsel for the applicants requested that I award solicitor-client costs in the event that he be successful. I see no special reason for making this award.
Application allowed in part.
