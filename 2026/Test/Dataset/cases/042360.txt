Dubé, J.
: The applicant ("General Boyle") seeks an order prohibiting the respondents ("the Commissioners") from making any adverse findings against him pursuant to notices issued to him under Section 13 of the
Inquiries Act
[see footnote 1] on May 21, August 19, 1996 and January 31, 1997; and also an order restraining the Governor-in-Council ("the G.I.C.") from publishing any report containing such adverse findings before the final disposition of this judicial review application.
[2]
I heard the application on June 24 and 25 and denied it by Order released on June 27, 1997, with reasons to follow. These are the reasons.
I -
Background information
[3]
On March 20, 1995, the Government appointed a Commission pursuant to Part 1 of the
Inquiries Act
with terms of reference requiring the Commissioners to investigate and report upon the three stages of the Canadian Forces mission to Somalia, that is the "pre-deployment phase", the "in-theatre phase" and the "post-deployment phase". On January 10, 1997, the Government informed the Commission that it would not grant it a third extension as requested, and the deadline for its final report would be June 30, 1997.
[4]
Under its terms of reference, the Commission was mandated inter alia to inquire into and report on the chain of command system, leadership, discipline, operations, actions and decisions of the Canadian Forces and of the Department of National Defence ("DND") in respect to the Canadian Forces deployment in Somalia.
[5]
The Commission held procedural and policy hearings in May and June 1995 and began its evidentiary hearings on October 2, 1995. The first phase of the evidentiary hearings, which ended on February 22, 1996, was devoted to the "pre-deployment phase" of the Somalia operation. Forty-six witnesses were heard during that phase. The second phase, the "in-theatre phase", was to examine events and activities which occurred in Somalia between January 10 and June 10, 1993. That phase began on April 1, 1996, with the "arrival in Somalia" hearings.
[6]
Parallel to the preparation and conduct of the evidentiary hearings, there was an on going concern within the Commission regarding the completeness of documents received from the Somalia Inquiry Liaison Team ("SILT") at the Canadian Forces Headquarters in coordination with DND. The hearings of the "in-theatre phase" were thus interrupted between April 15 and August 30, 1996 for the purpose of conducting self-contained hearings dealing with what has been called the "production of documents phase" of the public hearings.
[7]
During the "production of documents phase" of the hearings, from April 24 to August 30, 1996, and on October 2, 1996, 17 witnesses were heard, including General Boyle, regarding alleged tampering of documents, an alleged order to destroy documents, the methods by which officials of SILT delivered documents to the Commission, missing logs and communications within the chain of command regarding the flow of information to the Commission. General Boyle testified for nine days in August 1996 and at that time all witnesses for that phase had been heard, but one. (Roberto Gonzales, civilian director of the Directorate General of Public Affairs, who was recalled on October 2, 1996).
[8]
The Commission resumed its hearings on the "in-theatre phase" on September 9, 1996, and ended these hearings on March 14, 1997. The three following weeks in March and April 1997, were scheduled for the hearing of witnesses at the request of Section 13 Notice recipients. The week of April 7, 1997, was set aside for oral submissions by counsel for the Section 13 Notice recipients. On that occasion, General Boyle's counsel, Mr. Peel, made oral submissions and General Boyle filed written submissions. He could have testified orally as a witness had he chosen to do so.
[9]
Following a decision of my colleague Madame Justice Simpson (an appeal of her decision was heard on June 25, 1997 by the Federal Court of Appeal but a decision has not yet been released), the G.I.C. issued on April 3, 1997, a new amending Order P.C. 1997-456 stipulating that the Commissioners address in their Report all the elements from their mandate relating to the "pre-deployment phase" but granted them discretion to determine whether, and the extent to which, they will inquire and report on the "in-theatre" and "post-deployment" phases.

The injunctive relief
[10]
It is common ground that the applicable criteria for an interim injunction are those set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reiterated by that Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  establish that there is a serious issue to be tried; second, he must show that irreparable harm will be suffered if the stay of proceedings is not granted; and, third, he must prove that the balance of convenience favours him.
1-
Serious issue
a)
The applicant's allegations
[11]
With reference to the first criteria, serious issue to be tried, the applicant attacked the Commission on several fronts. His arguments, for the sake of brevity, may be abridged as follows:
[12]
1. The last Section 13 Notice to General Boyle, issued by way of a letter dated January 31, 1997, is fundamentally ambiguous. It is not clear whether the "process" that General Boyle is charged with having "devised" or "condoned" misled the public or the Commission or both. The notice charges General Boyle with knowing deceit.
[13]
2. A commission of public inquiry appointed pursuant to Part 1 of the
Inquiries Act
has no jurisdiction to make findings that would be construed by reasonable members of the public as findings of criminal and/or civil responsibility.
[14]
3. The charge that General Boyle "devised" or "condoned" such a process amounts to a finding that he disobeyed a directive of the Chief of Defence Staff, which would amount to a finding that he committed a serious offence under the
National Defence Act
[see footnote 4], an offence punishable by life imprisonment.
[15]
4. The right in section 7 of the
Charter
to "security of the person" is engaged where a Commissioner of a public inquiry threatens the reputational interest of an individual with the same stigma that is associated with a criminal charge without having afforded the individual due process in accordance with the "principles of fundamental justice".
[16]
5. Section 13 of the
Inquiries Act
requires that the recipient of a charge of misconduct be given a "full opportunity to be heard". Thus, General Boyle was entitled to know precisely the charge he had to meet, to be informed of the evidence, and to be given the opportunity to adduce evidence in response.
[17]
6. General Boyle harbours a reasonable apprehension of bias. The press conferences of the Commissioners and the letters and affidavits from the Commission show that the Commissioners were not seen as maintaining an attitude that is free of partiality.
[18]
7. The charges made by the Commissioners against General Boyle are analogous to an accusation that he has committed contempt ex facie curiae by having conspired with others to breach the orders of the Commission and to frustrate its investigation. Contempt, whether civil or criminal, can only be established by a standard of proof that is beyond a reasonable doubt. There is a failure of natural justice where persons are in a position to be the judges in their own case.
[19]
8. There are reasonable grounds for an apprehension that the Commissioners are not in a position to impartially decide the charges against General Boyle because they have already stated publicly that their efforts to obtain all of the information and documents they sought have been "frustrated", either "through ineptitude or deliberate intent" by the DND. To a reasonable bystander, the two press conferences would make it appear that the Commissioners have already made up their minds.
[20]
9. The Commissioners refused to produce their notes of a meeting held June 15, 1995 when the Commissioners met with General Boyle and BGen Boutet, a meeting which General Boyle maintains resulted in what he thought was a "meeting of the minds" on the scope of the investigation. After that meeting of June 15, 1995, General Boyle expected that, if problems arose with reference to the delivery of documents, he himself would be contacted not only his underlings.
[21]
10. Once the Commissioners were denied their third extension, they fundamentally amended the Section 13 Notice to General Boyle, not by particularizing it, but by making it vague and ambiguous, alleging "poor and inadequate leadership" without specifying the standards that apply.
[22]
11. General Boyle is entitled to know the evidence upon which the charges against him are based. If the notes of the June 15, 1995 meeting contain material that refutes General Boyle's position, he is entitled to know that: if they contain material that supports his position, the Commissioners are in no position to withhold them.
[23]
12. Natural justice requires that the opportunity to be heard in response to a charge of misconduct be both "full" and "fair". The Commissioners allowed General Boyle to adduce the evidence of two of his superiors and of one colleague in affidavit form but refused to hear them viva voce.
[24]
13. The Commissioners also refused to permit the recall of Col Leclerc and LGen Fox who testified prior to the issuance of the "leadership" charge in the January 31, 1997 letter.
b)
The Commission's factual response
[25]
It is not in dispute that General Boyle was represented throughout the public hearings by Government of Canada counsel, including attendance at the hearings, access to all documents in the possession of the Commission, the "will-say" of prospective witnesses, the opportunity of cross-examination of all witnesses whose testimony was relevant to his interest, the opportunity to make oral and written submissions and to testify himself.
[26]
The "production of documents phase" of the public hearings is different and distinct from the "cover-up" of the events which occurred in Somalia. It deals with two other aspects. First, the operations of SILT, including the steps taken by it to ensure timely compliance with the Commission's order for the production of documents, and second, allegations respecting the alteration and an attempt to destroy documents known as responses to queries ("RTQ's") in order to avoid delivery of these documents to the Commission. The "production of documents phase" was entirely covered by the Commission and was not affected by the "truncation" of the Inquiry.
[27]
Throughout the Inquiry, the Commissioners followed the procedure under which all parties, including counsel for General Boyle, were provided with all relevant documents being canvassed in the public hearings. Over 300 books of documents had been distributed by the end of the hearings. At least on three occasions, on April 12, June 27 and August 6, 1996, General Boyle and his counsel met with Commission counsel in preparation for General Boyle's testimony before the Commission on the "production of documents phase" of the hearings.
[28]
Following the Government's January 10, 1997 decision not to grant a third extension to the Commission, the Commissioners withdrew the Section 13 Notice dealing with the events that occurred in Somalia and sent letters to the remaining recipients of Section 13 Notices, including General Boyle, particularizing the original notices.
[29]
On February 20, 1997, counsel for all parties, including General Boyle's counsel, participated in a meeting with the Commission counsel to deal with the "section 13 hearings" and the Commission counsel provided those present with suggested guidelines for written and oral submissions. On March 6, 1997, so as to assist counsel in their preparation for their final submissions, the Commission counsel distributed to all parties, including counsel for General Boyle, a copy of their own final submissions regarding the "pre-deployment" and the "production of documents" phases.
c)
Procedural fairness
[30]
The first serious issue that arises is whether the Commission following the truncation of the Inquiry on January 10, 1997 satisfied the duty to be fair to the applicant. It is trite law that the rules of procedural fairness and the duty to be fair are flexible principles. The Supreme Court of Canada has often ruled that both the principles of natural justice and the duty to be fair are variable and must be assessed in the light of each case [see footnote 5]. Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, of the Supreme Court of Canada colourfully described what constitutes fairness in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [...] lawyers and judges have tried to define what constitutes fairness. Like defining an elephant, it is not easy to do, although fairness in practice has the elephantine quality of being easy to recognize [...]."
[31]
She went on to say that "the aim is not to create 'procedural perfection', but to achieve a certain balance between the need for fairness, efficiency and predictability of outcome". It is a well established principle that an investigative body is not bound to observe procedural fairness to the same extent as an adjudicative body. A commission of inquiry is not a court of law. It is really the nature of the body that determines the level of the duty that must be observed. The function of a commission of inquiry is primarily fact-finding. The commentaries of Cory, J., of the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  primary functions of public inquiries is fact-finding. They are often convened, in the wake of public shock, horror, disillusionment, or scepticism, in order to uncover 'the truth'. Inquiries are, like the judiciary, independent; unlike the judiciary, they are often endowed with wide-ranging investigative powers. In following their mandates, commissions of inquiry are, ideally, free from partisan loyalties and better able than Parliament or the legislatures to take a long-term view of the problem presented. Cynics decry public inquiries as a means used by the government to postpone acting in circumstances which often call for speedy action. Yet, these inquiries can and do fulfil an important function in Canadian society. In times of public questioning, stress and concern they provide the means for Canadians to be apprised of the conditions pertaining to a worrisome community problem and to be a part of the recommendations that are aimed at resolving the problem. Both the status and high public respect for the commissioner and the open and public nature of the hearing help to restore public confidence not only in the institution or situation investigated but also in the process of government as a whole. They are an excellent means of informing and educating concerned members of the public."
[32]
The role of commissioners in an inquiry was clearly described by the Federal Court of Appeal in the recent decision of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  instance assimilated Commissioners to judges. Both, in his view, exercise 'trial like functions'.
That is clearly wrong
. A public inquiry is not equivalent to a civil or criminal trial [...]. In a trial, the judge sits as an adjudicator, and it is the responsibility of the parties alone to present the evidence. In an inquiry, the commissioners are endowed with wide-ranging investigative powers to fulfil their investigative mandate [...].
The rules of evidence and procedure are therefore considerably less strict for an inquiry than for a court
. Judges determine rights as between parties; the Commission can only 'inquire' and 'report' [...]" (emphasis added)
[33]
Furthermore, the issuance of a Section 13 Notice does not convert the investigative process of commissioners into a dispute between parties. A Section 13 Notice is not a formal "charge" in a criminal process. Moreover, section 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
("the
Charter
") cannot be invoked as a source of protection for the persons involved. Section 7 of the
Charter
does not address damage to reputation [see footnote 9]. My colleague Mr. Justice Richard stated clearly in the
Krever
case that "there is no authority to support the proposition that security of the person encompasses mere reputation" [see footnote 10].
[34]
Thus, the duty to be fair, in the circumstances of an inquiry, is not as exacting as in a court of law. The procedural rights to which an individual is entitled in an inquiry are to be found under sections 12 and 13 of the
Inquiries Act
. On that score, Mr. Justice Décary of the Court of Appeal, said as follows in the above
Krever
decision, at p. 263:
"Section 13 requires 'reasonable notice' ('préavis suffisant' in the French version). The words 'reasonable' and 'suffisant' include a content element and a time element. A person who receives a notice must have a
good idea of the misconduct that is imputed to him or her and must have sufficient time, before the report is made, to prepare and present an adequate response
.
"The content of the notice may vary depending on when it is given: a notice given before the hearings commence will likely be less detailed than one given after the hearings have concluded."
[35]
At the
Krever
inquiry, Section 13 Notices were issued at the end of the hearing, whereas in the instant case they were issued at the beginning. It is common ground that inquiry commissioners must insure that no report be made until a reasonable notice has been given, that the recipient must have a good idea of the misconduct that may be imputed to him, and that he be allowed full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. Since the commissioners are masters of their own procedures, they have a very broad discretion as to how they conduct the inquiry. That discretion may only be questioned by the court in exceptional circumstances [see footnote 11]. Lord Denning said as follows with reference to the responsibilities of an investigating body:
"[...] The investigating body is, however, the master of its own procedure. It need not hold a hearing. It can do everything in writing. It need not allow lawyers. It need not put every detail of the case against a man. Suffice it if the broad grounds are given. It need not name its informants. It can give the substance only. Moreover it need not do everything itself. [...] [see footnote 12]."
[36]
And the terms of reference given to the Commissioners provide them with a broad procedural discretion, as follows:
"the Commissioners be authorized to adopt such procedures and methods as they may consider expedient for the proper conduct of the inquiry" [see footnote 13].
[37]
It follows that after the truncation of their mandate, the Commissioners were entitled to adapt their procedures to the newly created circumstances while ensuring that procedural fairness be extended to all concerned, including the Section 13 Notice recipients. The Commissioners were entitled to exercise their discretion and to balance the procedural rights of the individuals involved against the public interest by adjusting their schedule to a new time-frame. They had the responsibility of restricting the number of witnesses to those determined by them to be relevant, to decide whether or not witnesses would be heard orally or by way of affidavit, and to limit the scope of cross-examination. As mentioned earlier, counsel for the Commission met on several occasions with counsel for the Section 13 Notice recipients, including General Boyle, to try to accommodate the requests for witnesses and to arrive at a reasonable allocation of time among the parties.
[38]
The applicant was entitled to a reasonable notice, that is reasonable in time and reasonable with respect to content. As mentioned earlier, in the
Krever
inquiry, the Section 13 Notices were issued at the end of the hearing, whereas in the Somalia Inquiry the recipients had the advantage of an early notice. The Federal Court of Appeal held in the
Krever
appeal that a Section 13 Notice can legally be issued even after the hearings of a commission of inquiry. General Boyle received his first notice on May 21, 1996, nearly three months before his testimony began on August 12, 1996. The amended notice served on him on August 19, 1996, during the course of his testimony was the same in substance as the first notice. The January 31, 1997 letter further particularized the notices.
[39]
General Boyle was already familiar with the whole matter considering his role previous to the Inquiry. In 1993, then Major General Boyle held the post of Associate Assistant Deputy Minister, Policy and Communications. He was also tasked with co-ordinating the efforts of the various Department Heads at DND in relation with the "post-deployment phase" of the Somalia mission. The group was named the "Somalia Working Group". He is the one who recommended that the Government establish a full and public inquiry to identify any systemic problems in DND and recommend solutions to them. He even co-authored the terms of reference for the Inquiry along with Judge Advocate General Brigadier-General Boutet. He was therefore very knowledgeable and well informed as to the meaning of the particulars of his Section 13 Notices. And throughout the Inquiry, Commission counsel were available to provide any explanations, if necessary.
[40]
Neither can it be said that General Boyle was not afforded full opportunity to be heard. As mentioned earlier, through his counsel he was present and participated in the process throughout the Inquiry. With reference to the Section 13 Notice hearing, he was given full opportunity to testify, table written submissions, make oral submissions and file affidavit evidence. He was also offered an opportunity to testify again before the Commission after the second testimony of Mr. Roberto Gonzalez to the effect that General Boyle was aware of the decision to alter the RTQ's before the informal release to the media. He declined the invitation. It is true that he was refused the right to have all his witnesses testify viva voce. There was no obligation upon the Commission to hear witnesses orally [see footnote 14]. In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [see footnote 15] decision, my colleague MacKay, J., said as follows with reference to the evidence of witnesses at an inquiry:
"[...] Even if, as now appears, any person against whom findings may be made will not have opportunity to call witnesses or adduce their own evidence in the course of public hearings, as once was contemplated, there can still be opportunity for response in writing by any person to whom the Commission gives notice of a possible specific conclusion that would fall within s. 13 of the
Act
."
d)
Reasonable apprehension of bias
[41]
The Federal Court of Appeal [see footnote 16] recently reversed a decision of the Trial Division to the effect that BGen Beno had reasonable grounds for an apprehension that the Commissioners would be biased against him. The Court of Appeal held that because of the different nature of a commission inquiry, as opposed to civil or criminal proceedings, the high adjudicative standard of impartiality of court proceedings is not to be expected from a commission of inquiry. The court held, at p. 14, that "In this case, a flexible application of the reasonable apprehension of bias test requires that the reviewing court take into consideration the fact that the commissioners were acting as investigators in the context of a long, arduous and complex inquiry". It also concluded that "A commissioner should be disqualified for bias only if the challenger establishes a reasonable apprehension that the commissioner would reach a conclusion on a basis other than the evidence".
[42]
The grounds for apprehension of bias relied upon by the applicant arise mostly from the press conferences held by the Commissioners where they stated they had not reached any "firm conclusions" as to whether there was a "cover-up" and that they have been "frustrated" either "through ineptitude or deliberate intent" by DND. The applicant claims that, to a reasonable bystander, it would appear that the Commissioners had already made up their minds: since General Boyle is the only person to have been charged of misconduct in the "production of documents phase", it would appear that the Commissioners have closed their minds concerning his role in the "production of documents phase".
[43]
The applicant also revisits the June 15, 1995 meeting when he and BGen Boutet met with the Commissioners and claims that the Commissioners' refusal to produce their own notes taken at the meeting is indicative of their intentions in this matter. The Commissioners' answers to that argument is that there was no official transcript of that meeting and that the personal notes of the participants are personal. They also point out that General Boyle himself was free to testify as to what took place at that meeting and could have done so at the Section 13 Notice hearing but chose not to appear personally.
[44]
It is well known to the participants and to the Canadian public that the Commissioners were not in a happy mood at those press conferences and were reacting angrily to the Government's decision to curtail the Inquiry. In any event, the Federal Court of Appeal has already decided that the above factors did not constitute reasonable grounds for an apprehension of bias on the part of the Commissioners against another Section 13 Notice recipient (BGen Beno).
e)
Disposition of the serious issue matter
[45]
Generally, the serious issue threshold is very low in matters of interim or interlocutory injunctions, witness the Supreme Court of Canada in the MacDonald decision [see footnote 17], at p. 337:
"Once satisfied that the application is neither vexatious nor frivolous, the motions judge should proceed to consider the second and third tests, even if of the opinion that the plaintiff is unlikely to succeed at trial. A prolonged examination of the merits is generally neither necessary nor desirable."
[46]
Although a prolonged examination of the merits is usually neither necessary nor desirable at the interim injunction stage, in this instance the merits were debated at great lengths in the course of a two day hearing and very little time was spent on the other two injunctive criteria. As a matter of fact, the whole debate centred on the crucial issue as to whether or not the Commission afforded General Boyle due process according to the requirements of section 13 of the
Inquiries Act
and the doctrine of procedural fairness and/or natural justice [see footnote 18].
[47]
My answer to the two prongs of that question is in the affirmative. General Boyle was represented throughout the public hearings by counsel. He testified during a period of nine days. He had access to all the documents, the opportunity to cross-examine all witnesses on evidence relevant to his interest, and was offered the opportunity to testify again in the Section 13 Notice hearing. The standard of procedural fairness for an inquiry commission is not as exacting as for a court of law. Such an inquiry is not an adjudicative proceeding leading to a judgment or a conviction, but merely an investigative proceeding resulting in a report on which the Government may or may not act. Section 7 of the
Charter
may not be invoked to protect a reputation. It is to be expected that a public official involved in an inquiry may be the subject of adverse findings in its report. After all, a public official is accountable to the public. The applicant was entitled to a reasonable notice under section 13 of the
Inquiries Act
and he received three such notices. He was given full opportunity to prepare himself and to disclose the full evidence within his knowledge. As an officer of long experience, very knowledgeable in the matters under review, it cannot be said that he was taken by surprise or was otherwise denied procedural fairness.
III -
Disposition of the application
[48]
The purpose of this instant motion was to prohibit the Commissioners from making any adverse findings against General Boyle. That prohibition cannot issue for the reasons given and more specifically because the applicant was afforded due process according to the law and the jurisprudence in the matter.
[49]
Under the circumstances, it is not necessary to move on to the two other injunctive criteria, irreparable harm and balance of convenience. In any event, had I pursued the matter I would have found as I did in my earlier decision involving
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  convenience clearly favoured the release of the Report to the public.
[50]
These are the reasons why the application was dismissed.
Application dismissed.
