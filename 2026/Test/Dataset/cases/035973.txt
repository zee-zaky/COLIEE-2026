Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Kane, J.
: Tsering Lhamo, the applicant in these proceedings, is the spouse of a Convention refugee in Canada, Tsering Norbu. Mr Norbu lived with his wife and family in India as stateless Tibetan refugees. Mr Norbu was granted refugee status in Canada in 2009. At the time of his application, Mr Norbu, as principal applicant, included his wife and two sons as family members. His wife subsequently applied for a visa for herself and one son, as a dependent of a protected person. The visa application was refused.
[2]
Ms Lhamo now seeks judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the
Act
], of the April 20, 2012 decision of the Visa Officer (the Officer) at the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi, India, which determined that she did not meet the requirements for permanent resident status as a dependent of a protected person in Canada.
[3]
In assessing the application, the Officer had sought verification that the principal applicant, Mr Norbu, and the applicant, Ms Lhamo, were the biological parents of the sons. DNA results indicated that the younger son was the biological son of the applicant but not the son of Mr Norbu. Prior to submitting to the DNA testing, the older son chose to remain in India with his girlfriend and his name was removed from the application.
[4]
Following the receipt of the DNA results, Mr Norbu responded to the procedural fairness letter from the Officer indicating that he was saddened by this revelation. He indicated that his wife had disclosed an extra-marital affair, however he had come to terms with this and he wished to pursue the application. In his more recent affidavit, after the visa application was refused, Mr Norbu indicated that he always knew the two sons were not his biological children. The older son had been abandoned at birth and he and his wife adopted and raised him. The younger child was the son of his wife and her former husband, who had died shortly after the birth of the child. Mr Norbu explained that he was desperate to bring his family to Canada, and that he had received bad advice and thought that the only way to do so was to state that the sons were his own. He was not aware that as the son of his spouse, the younger son could have been included as a family member.
[5]
It should be noted that the more recent information included in Mr Norbu's affidavit was not before the Officer. The Officer only had the explanation from Mr Norbu that his wife had had an affair.
The Decision
[6]
The reasons for the decision include the letter of refusal dated April 2012 and the CAIPS notes which trace the processing of the application. The letter of the Officer indicates that he was not satisfied with the explanation provided. The Officer was not satisfied that the applicant was not inadmissible and that the applicant met the requirements of the
Act
.
[7]
In refusing the application, the Officer referred to subsection 16(1) of the
Act,
which requires that applicants answer truthfully and completely with the requisite and relevant evidence and documents, and to section 11, which provides that a visa may be issued if the Officer is satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of the
Act
. The Officer also relied on subsections 176(1) and (3) of the
Regulations
which provide that applicants may include family members; however, family members who are inadmissible pursuant to subsection 21(2) of the
Act
shall not become permanent residents
.

The Issues
[9]
The applicant raises three grounds for review: firstly, that the Officer erred in relying on section 16; secondly, that the Officer conflated the requirements under section 16 with those under section 40 regarding misrepresentation, which is not a ground for inadmissibility of a dependent of a protected person, and in the alternative, that there was no misrepresentation; and thirdly, that the Officer called into question the genuineness of the marriage of the applicant and principal applicant but did not provide any opportunity for them to respond, which is a breach of procedural fairness.
[10]
With respect to all grounds, the applicant submits that the provisions of the
Act
must be considered in the context of the overall objectives and purpose of the
Act
which is to offer protection for refugees. The applicant noted several provisions in the
Act
which apply to family members of protected persons, recognise their special circumstances, and provide some leniency in the processing of their applications for permanent residence.
[11]
With respect to subsection 16(1), the applicant agrees that truthfulness is an important consideration for visa officers. Despite this, the applicant again relies on specific provisions of the
Act
that acknowledge the unique circumstances of refugees and, in particular, the family members of protected persons.
[12]
The applicant submits that the requirement of subsection 16(1) to answer truthfully is not a ground of inadmissibility to refuse an application for permanent residency of a spouse of a protected person pursuant to subsection 176(3) of the
Regulations.
[13]
With respect to the interaction between subsection 176(3) of the
Regulations
and section 21 of the
Act,
the applicant submits that the only grounds for inadmissibility for family members of protected persons in Canada are those set out in subsection 21(2), which in turn refers to sections 34, 35, 36(1), 37 and 38: security (s 34), human or international human rights violations (s 35), serious criminality (s 36(1)), organized criminality (s 37), or serious health grounds (s 38).
[14]
Simply put, the applicant's position is that the requirement to be truthful and the requirement not to make misrepresentations are not grounds for inadmissibility under section 21. The applicant submits that the application cannot be refused for either of these reasons.
[15]
In the alternative, the applicant submits that if misrepresentation could be a ground to refuse the application, there was no misrepresentation. In particular, the applicant argues that the information withheld was not of a material fact relating to a relevant matter and it could not have induced an error in the administration of the
Act
.
[16]
The applicant notes that she or the principal applicant could have disclosed that the principal applicant, Mr Norbu, was not the biological father of their son and could have still claimed the son as a
de facto
dependent child. Therefore, the applicant submits that the misrepresentation could not induce an error in the administration of the
Act
.
[17]
In later submissions, the applicant notes that the son could have been claimed as a "family member" as the son of the principal applicant's spouse.
[18]
The applicant also submits that the Officer breached a duty of procedural fairness by not allowing the applicant and her husband an opportunity to respond to the Officer's concerns about the
bona fides
of their marriage.
[19]
The respondent submits that subsection 16(1) is clearly drafted and requires that all applications must be truthful. The failure of an applicant to be truthful is a reasonable ground for refusal of the application. The respondent submits that nothing prevents a refusal pursuant to section 16. While the objectives of the
Act
are well-understood, no provision of the
Act
trumps another. Moreover, the application of the
Act
cannot encourage applicants to make false statements.
[20]
The respondent further submits that the Officer did not confuse or conflate the provisions of section 40 and section 16. In his CAIPS notes, the Officer acknowledged that he erroneously referred to misrepresentation in his procedural fairness letter, but knew he was dealing with the dependent of a protected person and that section 16 was applicable, not section 40.
[21]
On the issue of misrepresentation more generally, whether or not section 40 is applicable, the respondent submits that the information that was withheld could have led to an error in the administration of the
Act
. But for the Officer's request for the DNA tests and the results, the principal applicant's family would have landed in Canada without disclosure of the true facts.
[22]
The respondent also notes that the principal applicant was untruthful in both the application and his explanation to the Visa Officer where he indicated he had just discovered that his wife had an affair. In his subsequent affidavit, he indicated that this was not true and he also indicated that the age of the son had not been accurately disclosed.
[23]
I would note that the information in the more recent affidavit was not before the Officer who based his decision only on the information before him.
[24]
With respect to the allegations of procedural fairness, the respondent submits that the
bona fides
of the marriage was not an issue for the Officer. The decision was based on the lack of truthfulness of the applicant.
Standard of Review
[25]
An immigration officer's factual findings relating to an applicant's eligibility for permanent residence in Canada are reviewable on a reasonableness standard:
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47, [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[26]
Where the standard of reasonableness applies, the role of the Court is not to substitute any decision it would have made, but to "determine if the outcome 'falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law': <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47. There may be more than one reasonable outcome. However, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome": <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 59.
[27]
A breach of procedural fairness and other issues raising questions of law are reviewable on the standard of correctness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ no 1326 at para 16;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ no 875 at para 29; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 43;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 79.
[28]
The applicant submits that the Officer erred in law by relying on section 16, which is reviewable on the correctness standard.
[29]
The thrust of the applicant's argument relates to the interpretation of the provisions of the
Act
and the
Regulations
, and how particular provisions relate to each other. As the
Act
would be within the Officer's area of expertise, I would not characterize the interpretation of the provisions at issue as questions of law for which a correctness standard applies.
[30]
I would note that the
Act
is a comprehensive regime that must be interpreted in a purposive way in the spirit of the objectives of the
Act
. No single provision can be considered without regard to the related provisions and the overall objectives of the
Act
. Section 3 sets out objectives with respect to immigration and refugees and the application of the
Act
, all of which must be considered and balanced in interpreting specific provisions.
[31]
The issues in the present case focus on the factual determinations of the Officer and how the Officer applied the law to the facts and exercised his discretion whether to grant the visa. The decision is, therefore, reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
Did the Officer err by incorrectly applying s 16(1) of the Act?
[32]
The main issue is whether the Officer erred by referring to s 16(1) of the
Act
as the reason for finding the applicant inadmissible.
[33]
The CAIPS notes indicate the following:
Refused under 16.1 (sic) as HOF in Canada and PA provided bogus birthc ertificates (sic) for their listed dependents and did not declare that only accompnying (sic) dependetn (sic) is not biological son of HOF.
Refusal letter. I also note that they never answered our PF letter from may (sic) 2011.
[34]
In the April 13, 2012 entry, the Officer acknowledges that a response had in fact been provided to the procedural fairness [PF] letter:
The HoF gives the explanation that his wife had an indiscretion (i.e. an affair) with another man without him being aware of it. However given that the other son, Richen Tenzin desisted from undergoing DNA testing just 2 months after we requested it in July 2010. This seems more than a coincidence as it is likely that he is not the son of the HoF.
The explanation given by the HoF about his wife having an affair is possible but I am not entirely convinced. As well she failed to declare that her sons were not the HoF's sons thus she did lie by omission on her appln form. Thus my decision to refuse remains unchanged. Refusal still stands.
[35]
In the letter of refusal, the Officer clearly states that he was unconvinced by the answer provided. The Officer referred to subsection 11(1) of the
Act
which provides that a visa shall be issued if an officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible
and
that the foreign national meets the requirements of the
Act.
The Officer concluded that he was not satisfied that the applicant was not inadmissible
and
he was not satisfied that the applicant had met the requirements of the
Act
.
[36]
Regardless of whether the duty to be truthful is a specific ground of inadmissibility, it is clearly a requirement of the
Act
.
[37]
Although a person may not be inadmissible pursuant to the specific grounds of inadmissibility set out in subsection 21(3), they are not automatically admissible and provided with a visa. The requirements of the
Act
must be met. One of those requirements is that an applicant be truthful.
[38]
Section 11 is clearly a discretionary provision with two criteria. It provides that an officer
may
issue a visa if the officer is satisfied that first, the applicant is not inadmissible, and second, that the applicant meets the requirements of the
Act
.
[39]
Section 16 is a key requirement of the
Act
which the Officer found had not been met. The Officer did not err in relying on section 16 as a reason to refuse the application pursuant to section 11.
Inadmissibility of Family Members
[40]
Subsections 176(1) and (3) of the
Regulations,
set out above, and referred to by the Officer, provide that the grounds for inadmissibility of a family member are those set out in subsection 21(2) of the
Act
.
[41]
As noted above, the grounds listed under subsection 21(2) of the
Act
include: security (s 34), human or international human rights violations (s 35), serious criminality (s 36(1)), organized criminality (s 37), or serious health grounds (s 38).
[42]
The applicant submits that the
Regulations
do not include misrepresentation as a ground of inadmissibility in family member applications, and therefore, the Officer erred in law by finding the applicant inadmissible and refusing the application.
[43]
The applicant also relies on the OP 24 Operational Manual, which includes guidelines specifically for family members of protected persons (DR2). The applicant notes that paragraph 10.7 of OP 24 states that misrepresentation cannot be used as a basis for inadmissibility of family members of protected persons.
[44]
Paragraph 10.7 provides:
A40 cannot be used as a basis for the refusal of DR2 family members of protected persons
. A40 is not included in the grounds for inadmissibility of family members of protected persons cited in A21(2), as per R176(3). Where material misrepresentation occurs and concerns a non
bona fide
relationship or the identity of the family member (e.g., marriage of convenience, adoption of convenience, misrepresentation of marriage records or of a child's birth records, etc.), then the family member should be refused not as per A40, but as per R176(1) and R176(3). See the procedures for refusal of ineligible family members in section 10.6 above. [emphasis in original]
(Note that A40 refers to section 40 of the Act which is set out above, regarding misrepresentation.)
[45]
The respondent agrees that section 40 is not applicable to family members of protected persons and also notes that the Officer acknowledged this in the CAIPS notes.
[46]
The OP manual confirms that a section 40 misrepresentation finding cannot be relied on to refuse family members of protected persons. However, it goes on to provide that material misrepresentations and concerns of
bona fide
relationships should be used as a basis to refuse DR2 (dependents of protected persons) applicants under subsections 176(1) and (3) of the
Regulations.
[47]
In this case, the Officer referred to subsections 176(1) and 176(3) of the
Regulations
in addition to section 16 and section 11 and did not refer to section 40 of the
Act
.
[48]
Although it is not necessary to deal with the applicant's alternative argument given the acknowledgement that section 40 does not apply, the applicant submits that if misrepresentation were a ground of inadmissibility, there would be no such misrepresentation in this case because the requirements for misrepresentation were not present. The applicant referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Justice Snider set out the requirements for a finding of inadmissibility for misrepresentation as follows:
[27] Two factors must be present for a finding of inadmissibility under s. 40(1). There must be misrepresentations by the applicant and those misrepresentations must be material in that they could have induced an error in the administration of the
IRPA
. The standard of review in the first of these matters is, in my view, patent unreasonableness. These are determinations of fact, which the Visa Officer is in the best position to assess. Without coming to a final determination on the second factor, I will accept that the standard of review is reasonableness
simpliciter.
[49]
The standard of review would now be reasonableness as both are questions of fact: was there a misrepresentation by the applicant (which need not be intentional) and was that misrepresentation material in that it could have induced an error in the administration of the
Act
? As noted by Justice Snider in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the officer is in the best position to assess both requirements.
[50]
The applicant's position is that the failure to disclose that the principal applicant was not the biological father of the son is not a material misrepresentation because the son was otherwise a
de facto
dependent or a family member (as the son of the principal applicant's spouse). The failure to disclose the truth would not have induced an error in the administration of the
Act
because the applicant and son would have been admissible and the visa would have been granted if the truth were known.
[51]
The applicant also notes that if the decision to refuse had been based on misrepresentation, the consequences to the principal applicant's family would have been inadmissibility for a period of two years, rather than the potentially more severe consequences of the refusal pursuant to section 16.
[52]
The applicant further submits that the facts of this case are unique. The lies were innocent and the result of poor advice and the stress of the principal applicant's wife and son remaining in India as stateless persons.
[53]
While the applicant's submissions that the overall objectives of Canada's refugee protection regime recognise that applicants may have to take drastic measures to seek refugee protection, including sometimes to lie or to withhold information or to make misrepresentations, have been considered, and that the applicant's circumstances are troubling, I would note that the Officer is well aware of the conditions present in refugees' countries of origin and is tasked with administering the provisions of the
Act
to uphold both the spirit and integrity of the
Act
.
[54]
As noted, the Officer did not rely on section 40, which addresses misrepresentation, as the basis to refuse the visa application. Moreover, it is speculative for the applicant to suggest that if the truth were told, the visa application would have been issued, given that the decision to issue a visa is discretionary pursuant to section 11 of the
Act
.
Procedural Fairness
[55]
I do not agree with the applicant that the Officer questioned the
bona fides
of the applicant's marriage and failed to provide an opportunity for the applicant to respond. Although the CAIPS notes do state, "This brings into question the bona fide (sic) of the relationship between PA (sic) and Norbu Tsering", it is clear from reading the decision as a whole that the refusal was not based on any concerns about the marriage. The CAIPS notes go on to state that the marriage certificate is on file and is a certified copy.
[56]
Therefore, there was no breach of procedural fairness.
Proposed Certified Question
[57]
The applicant proposes the following question for certification:
"Where a withholding would not result in an error in the administration of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, does s 176(3) of the
Immigration and Refugee
Protection Regulations
limit the use of s 16 of the Act to those grounds of inadmissibility applicable to the dependents of Convention Refugees (CRs), when those dependents are processed concurrently with the CR's application for Permanent Residence?"
[58]
The respondent submits that this question would not be determinative of the application for judicial review and does not rise to the level of an issue of general importance.
[59]
I find the question difficult to understand as it raises issues that do not arise based on the wording of section 16 of the
Act
or subsection 176(3) of the
Regulations
. In addition, I find that the question would not resolve the issues before me because the Officer did not base his decision to refuse the visa on the basis of withholding and misrepresentation which are governed by section 40. The Officer relied on sections 16 and section 11. Section 16 does not refer to nor is it limited by specific grounds of inadmissibility; rather, it requires applicants to be truthful and to produce all relevant and required documents. Section 11 provides that a visa may be issued where two criteria are met: the applicant is not inadmissible, and the applicant meets the requirements of the
Act
. Therefore, the proposed question would not address the decision made in this case.
[60]
In conclusion, the application for judicial review is dismissed. The decision of the Officer was reasonable; it was transparent and intelligible and justified on the facts and the law.
As noted above, the question proposed is not appropriate for certification.
JUDGMENT
[61]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed;
2. No question is certified
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Lhamo, la demanderesse en l'espèce, est l'épouse d'un réfugié au sens de la Convention au Canada, Tsering Norbu. M. Norbu, son épouse et sa famille vivaient en Inde en tant que réfugiés tibétains apatrides. M. Norbu a obtenu le statut de réfugié au Canada en 2009. Au moment où il a présenté sa demande, M. Norbu, à titre de demandeur principal, avait inclus son épouse et ses deux fils comme membres de sa famille. Son épouse a par la suite présenté une demande de visa pour elle-même et pour un de ses fils, à titre de personne à charge d'une personne protégée. La demande de visa a été rejetée.
[2]
Mme Lhamo demande maintenant, en vertu de l'article 72 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi], le contrôle judiciaire de la décision du 20 avril 2012 par laquelle l'agent des visas (l'agent) du haut-commissariat du Canada à New Delhi, en Inde, a déterminé qu'elle ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences d'admissibilité au statut de résidente permanente comme personne à charge d'une personne protégée au Canada.
[3]
En évaluant la demande, l'agent a voulu vérifier si le demandeur principal, M. Norbu, et la demanderesse, Mme Lhamo, étaient les parents biologiques des garçons. Les résultats des tests d'ADN ont révélé que le benjamin était le fils biologique de la demanderesse, mais pas celui de M. Norbu. Avant que les tests d'ADN ne soient effectués, l'aîné a choisi de demeurer en Inde avec sa petite amie, de sorte que son nom a été retiré de la demande.
[4]
Après la réception des résultats des tests d'ADN, M. Norbu a répondu à la lettre d'équité de l'agent en se disant attristé par cette révélation. Son épouse lui avait avoué qu'elle avait eu une relation extraconjugale, mais il s'était fait à l'idée et souhaitait poursuivre la demande. Dans son dernier affidavit, souscrit après le rejet de la demande de visa, M. Norbu déclare avoir toujours su que les deux garçons n'étaient pas ses fils biologiques. L'aîné avait été abandonné à la naissance, puis adopté et élevé par lui et son épouse. Le benjamin était le fils de son épouse et de son ex-mari, décédé peu de temps après la naissance de l'enfant. M. Norbu explique qu'il cherchait désespérément à faire venir sa famille au Canada, qu'il avait reçu de mauvais conseils et qu'il croyait que la seule chose à faire était de déclarer que les garçons étaient ses propres fils. Il ignorait que le benjamin, à titre de fils de son épouse, pouvait être inclus comme membre de la famille.
[5]
Il convient de souligner que l'agent n'était pas au courant des derniers renseignements contenus dans l'affidavit de M. Norbu. M. Norbu avait seulement expliqué à l'agent que son épouse avait eu une aventure.
Décision
[6]
Les motifs de la décision comprennent la lettre de refus d'avril 2012 et les notes du Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration (STIDI), qui relatent le traitement de la demande. La lettre de l'agent indique qu'il n'était pas satisfait de l'explication fournie. Il n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse n'était pas interdite de territoire et qu'elle se conformait à la Loi.
[7]
En rejetant la demande, l'agent s'est appuyé sur le paragraphe 16(1) de la Loi
,
selon lequel le demandeur doit répondre véridiquement aux questions qui lui sont posées et présenter tous les éléments de preuve pertinents et les documents requis, de même que sur l'article 11, selon lequel l'agent peut délivrer le visa s'il est convaincu que le demandeur n'est pas interdit de territoire et se conforme à la Loi. L'agent s'est également appuyé sur les paragraphes 176(1) et (3) du Règlement, selon lesquels la demande d'un demandeur peut viser tout membre de sa famille, mais que le membre de la famille interdit de territoire en application du paragraphe 21(2) de la Loi ne peut devenir résident permanent.

Questions en litige
[9]
La demanderesse fonde sa demande de contrôle judiciaire sur trois moyens: premièrement, l'agent a commis une erreur en s'appuyant sur l'article 16; deuxièmement, l'agent a fusionné les exigences prévues à l'article 16 et les règles concernant les fausses déclarations énoncées au paragraphe 40, qui ne constituent pas un motif d'interdiction de territoire dans le cas de la personne à charge d'une personne protégée, et, subsidiairement, il n'y a pas eu de fausses déclarations; troisièmement, l'agent a remis en question l'authenticité du mariage de la demanderesse et du demandeur principal, sans leur donner l'occasion de réagir, ce qui constituait un manquement à l'équité procédurale.
[10]
En ce qui concerne tous les moyens, la demanderesse soutient que les dispositions de la Loi doivent être examinées dans le contexte de l'objet et des objectifs généraux de la Loi, qui consistent à offrir protection aux réfugiés. La demanderesse souligne plusieurs dispositions de la Loi qui s'appliquent aux membres de la famille des personnes protégées, qui reconnaissent leurs circonstances spéciales et qui permettent une certaine clémence dans le traitement de leurs demandes de résidence permanente.
[11]
Dans le cas du paragraphe 16(1), la demanderesse convient que la véracité est un élément auquel les agents des visas doivent accorder de l'importance. Néanmoins, la demanderesse se fonde encore sur des dispositions particulières de la Loi qui reconnaissent les circonstances propres aux réfugiés et, plus particulièrement, aux membres de la famille de personnes protégées.
[12]
La demanderesse affirme que la nécessité de répondre véridiquement énoncée au paragraphe 16(1) n'est pas un motif d'interdiction de territoire qui permet de rejeter la demande de résidence permanente de l'époux ou épouse d'une personne protégée en vertu du paragraphe 176(3) du Règlement
.
[13]
Quant à l'interaction entre le paragraphe 176(3) du Règlement et l'article 21 de la Loi
,
la demanderesse soutient que les seuls motifs d'interdiction de territoire dans le cas de membres de la famille de personnes protégées au Canada sont ceux qui sont énoncés au paragraphe 21(2), qui renvoie à son tour aux articles 34 et 35, au paragraphe 36(1), et aux articles 37 et 38: la sécurité (article 34), l'atteinte aux droits humains ou internationaux (article 35), la grande criminalité (paragraphe 36(1)), les activités de criminalité organisée (article 37) et les motifs sanitaires (article 38).
[14]
En somme, la demanderesse soutient que l'obligation de répondre véridiquement et l'obligation de ne pas faire de fausses déclarations ne sont pas des motifs d'interdiction de territoire aux termes de l'article 21. La demanderesse affirme que la demande ne peut être refusée pour ni l'un ni l'autre de ces motifs.
[15]
Subsidiairement, si les fausses déclarations constituent un motif permettant le rejet de la demande, la demanderesse affirme alors qu'il n'y a pas eu de fausses déclarations. En particulier, la demanderesse soutient que le renseignement retenu n'était pas un fait important quant à un objet pertinent et qu'il ne pouvait pas avoir entraîné d'erreur dans l'application de la Loi.
[16]
La demanderesse souligne qu'elle-même ou le demandeur principal auraient pu divulguer le fait que le demandeur principal, M. Norbu, n'était pas le père biologique du garçon en question et que M. Norbu aurait quand même pu déclarer que ce garçon était un enfant à charge de fait
.
Par conséquent, la demanderesse soutient que la fausse déclaration n'aurait pas pu entraîner d'erreur dans l'application de la Loi.
[17]
Dans des observations subséquentes, la demanderesse souligne que le fils aurait pu être déclaré comme un « membre de la famille » à titre de fils de l'épouse du demandeur principal.
[18]
La demanderesse ajoute que l'agent a manqué à l'obligation d'équité procédurale en ne leur accordant pas, à elle et à son époux, la possibilité de réagir aux doutes qu'il avait sur l'authenticité de leur mariage.
[19]
Le défendeur soutient que le paragraphe 16(1) est clairement rédigé et précise que les demandes doivent être véridiques. Le fait qu'un demandeur n'a pas dit la vérité est un motif raisonnable permettant le rejet de sa demande. Le défendeur affirme que rien n'empêche le rejet de la demande en vertu de l'article 16. S'il est vrai que les objectifs de la Loi sont bien compris, aucune disposition de la Loi ne l'emporte sur les autres. De plus, la Loi ne peut être appliquée de manière à encourager les demandeurs à faire de fausses déclarations.
[20]
Le défendeur ajoute que l'agent n'a ni confondu ni fusionné les dispositions de l'article 40 avec celles de l'article 16. Selon les notes qu'il a consignées dans le STIDI, l'agent reconnaissait avoir mentionné par erreur les fausses déclarations dans sa lettre d'équité procédurale, mais savait que la demande concernait une personne à charge d'une personne protégée et que l'article 16, et non l'article 40, s'appliquait.
[21]
En ce qui concerne plus généralement la question des fausses déclarations, que l'article 40 soit applicable ou non, le défendeur soutient que le renseignement retenu aurait pu entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi. Si l'agent n'avait pas demandé que des tests d'ADN soient faits et que les résultats lui soient transmis, la famille du demandeur principal se serait établie au Canada sans avoir divulgué les faits réels.
[22]
Le défendeur ajoute que le demandeur principal n'a pas dit la vérité tant dans sa demande que dans l'explication donnée à l'agent selon laquelle il venait juste d'apprendre que son épouse avait eu une aventure. Dans l'affidavit qu'il a souscrit par la suite, le demandeur principal a révélé que cette explication n'était pas vraie et que l'âge du fils n'était pas exact non plus.
[23]
Je signalerais que les renseignements contenus dans le dernier affidavit n'avaient pas été portés à la connaissance de l'agent, qui a donc rendu sa décision en fonction des renseignements dont il disposait.
[24]
Quant aux allégations concernant l'équité procédurale, le défendeur soutient que l'agent n'a pas remis en question l'authenticité du mariage. L'agent a fondé sa décision sur le manque de franchise de la demanderesse.
Norme de contrôle
[25]
Les conclusions de fait tirées par l'agent d'immigration quant à l'admissibilité d'un candidat à la résidence permanente au Canada sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47, [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[26]
Quand la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique, le rôle de la Cour n'est pas de substituer la décision qu'elle aurait prise à celle qui a été retenue, mais de « déterminer si celle-ci fait partie des "issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par. 47). Il peut exister plus d'une issue raisonnable. Néanmoins, si le processus et l'issue en cause cadrent bien avec les principes de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité, la cour de révision ne peut y substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable »: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 59.
[27]
Le manquement à l'équité procédurale et les autres questions de droit sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1326, au paragraphe 16;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 875, au paragraphe 29; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 43;
Dunsmuir,
précité, au paragraphe 79.
[28]
La demanderesse soutient que l'agent a commis, en se fondant sur l'article 16, une erreur de droit susceptible de révision selon la norme de la décision correcte.
[29]
L'idée maîtresse de l'argument de la demanderesse concerne l'interprétation des dispositions de la Loi et du Règlement, et la façon dont certaines dispositions particulières sont interreliées. Étant donné que la Loi relève de l'expertise de l'agent, je ne caractériserais pas l'interprétation des dispositions en cause comme une question de droit à laquelle s'applique la norme de la décision correcte.
[30]
Je soulignerais que la Loi constitue un régime exhaustif qui doit être interprété de manière téléologique dans l'esprit de ses objectifs. Aucune disposition prise isolément ne peut être examinée sans que les dispositions connexes et les objectifs généraux de la Loi ne soient également pris en considération. L'article 3 décrit l'objet en matière d'immigration, l'objet relatif aux réfugiés ainsi que l'interprétation et la mise en œuvre de la Loi, qui doivent tous être examinés et soupesés au moment d'interpréter une disposition particulière.
[31]
En l'espèce, les questions en litige concernent les conclusions de fait de l'agent, et la façon dont l'agent a appliqué le droit aux faits et exercé le pouvoir discrétionnaire de délivrer ou non le visa. La décision est donc susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité.
L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur en appliquant incorrectement le paragraphe 16(1) de la Loi?
[32]
La principale question en litige est celle de savoir si l'agent a commis une erreur en se fondant sur le paragraphe 16(1) de la Loi pour conclure que la demanderesse était interdite de territoire.
[33]
L'agent indique ce qui suit dans les notes du STIDI:
[traduction] Rejeté en vertu de 16.1 (sic) parce que le chef de famille au Canada et demandeur principal a fourni de faux certificats de naissance pour les personnes à charge visées et n'a pas déclaré que le seul enfant à charge accompagnateur n'est pas le fils biologique du chef de famille.
Lettre de refus. Je note également qu'ils n'ont jamais répondu à notre lettre d'équité procédurale de mai 2011.
[34]
Dans les notes consignées le 13 avril 2012, l'agent reconnaît qu'une réponse à la lettre d'équité procédurale avait en fait été fournie:
[traduction] Le chef de famille explique que son épouse a eu un écart de conduite (c.-à-d. une aventure) avec un autre homme sans qu'il le sache. Toutefois, l'autre fils, Richen Tenzin, a refusé de passer le test d'ADN deux mois après la présentation de notre demande à cet effet en juillet 2010. Ça ne ressemble pas à une simple coïncidence, et il n'est probablement pas le fils du chef de famille.
L'explication donnée par le chef de famille, à savoir que son épouse a eu une aventure, est possible, mais je ne suis pas entièrement convaincu. L'épouse n'a pas déclaré non plus que les garçons n'étaient pas les fils du chef de famille. Elle a donc menti par omission sur son formulaire de demande. Ma décision demeure inchangée. Le refus tient toujours.
[35]
Dans la lettre de refus, l'agent indique clairement ne pas avoir été convaincu par la réponse fournie. L'agent renvoie au paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi, qui dispose que l'agent peut délivrer le visa s'il est convaincu que l'étranger n'est pas interdit de territoire
et
qu'il se conforme à la Loi
.
L'agent conclut qu'il n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse n'était pas interdite de territoire
et
qu'il n'était pas convaincu non plus que la demanderesse se conformait à la Loi.
[36]
Que l'obligation de dire la vérité soit un motif particulier d'interdiction de territoire ou non, il s'agit clairement d'une exigence de la Loi.
[37]
Bien qu'une personne puisse ne pas être interdite de territoire pour un des motifs définis expressément au paragraphe 21(3), sa demande ne sera pas automatiquement recevable, et un visa ne lui sera pas nécessairement délivré. Les exigences de la Loi doivent être respectées et, selon une de ces exigences, le demandeur doit dire la vérité.
[38]
L'article 11 est de toute évidence une disposition discrétionnaire comportant deux critères. Il précise que l'agent
peut
délivrer un visa sur preuve, tout d'abord, que le demandeur n'est pas interdit de territoire et, ensuite, que le demandeur se conforme à la Loi.
[39]
L'article 16 énonce une exigence fondamentale de la Loi, laquelle n'avait pas été respectée selon l'agent. L'agent n'a pas commis d'erreur en se fondant sur l'article 16 pour rejeter la demande en vertu de l'article 11.
Inadmissibilé familiale
[40]
Aux termes des paragraphes 176(1) et (3) du Règlement
,
reproduits ci-dessus et mentionnés par l'agent, un membre de la famille peut être interdit de territoire pour un des motifs visés au paragraphe 21(2) de la Loi.
[41]
Comme il a été précisé ci-dessus, les motifs visés au paragraphe 21(2) de la Loi comprennent la sécurité (article 34), l'atteinte aux droits humains ou internationaux (article 35), la grande criminalité (paragraphe 36(1)), les activités de criminalité organisée (article 37) et les motifs sanitaires (article 38).
[42]
La demanderesse soutient que les fausses déclarations ne font pas partie des motifs déterminant l'interdiction de territoire des membres de la famille visés par le Règlement et que, par conséquent, l'agent a commis une erreur en concluant qu'elle était interdite de territoire et en rejetant sa demande.
[43]
La demanderesse s'appuie également sur le guide opérationnel OP 24, qui contient des directives ayant trait expressément aux membres de la famille de personnes protégées (RD2). La demanderesse fait remarquer que, aux termes de la section 10.7 du guide OP 24, les fausses déclarations ne sont pas comprises dans les motifs déterminant l'interdiction de territoire des membres de la famille de personnes protégées.
[44]
La section 10.7 précise ce qui suit:
L40 ne peut être utilisé pour justifier le rejet de membres RD2 de la famille de personnes protégées
. L40 n'est pas inclus dans les motifs déterminant l'interdiction de territoire des membres de la famille de personnes protégées citées dans L21(2), aux termes de R176(3). En cas de fausse déclaration concernant la validité d'un lien ou de l'identité d'un membre de la famille (par exemple, mariage de convenance, adoption de convenance, faux certificats de mariage ou de naissance d'un enfant, etc.), le membre de la famille doit être refusé non pas aux termes de L40, mais bien aux termes de R176(1) ou de R176(3). Voir les procédures liées aux refus de membres de la famille dont la demande est irrecevable à la section 10.6 ci-dessus. [Souligné dans l'original.]
(Remarque: « A40 » s'entend de l'article 40 de la Loi concernant les fausses déclarations, reproduit ci-dessus.)
[45]
Le défendeur convient que l'article 40 ne s'applique pas aux membres de la famille de personnes protégées et ajoute que l'agent a reconnu ce fait dans ses notes du STIDI.
[46]
Le guide opérationnel confirme que les fausses déclarations visées à l'article 40 ne peuvent constituer un motif permettant de rejeter les demandes de membres de la famille de personnes protégées. Toutefois, le guide précise aussi que, en cas de fausse déclaration concernant la validité d'un lien, le membre RD2 (personne à charge d'une personne protégée) doit être refusé aux termes des paragraphes 176(1) et (3) du Règlement
.
[47]
En l'espèce, l'agent s'est fondé sur les paragraphes 176(1) et 176(3) du Règlement en plus des articles 16 et 11, mais il n'a pas renvoyé à l'article 40 de la Loi.
[48]
Bien qu'il ne soit pas nécessaire d'aborder l'argument subsidiaire de la demanderesse puisqu'il a été reconnu que l'article 40 ne s'appliquait pas, la demanderesse soutient que, si les fausses déclarations constituaient un motif d'interdiction de territoire, il n'y avait pas eu de fausses déclarations, étant donné que les éléments nécessaires pour qu'il y ait de fausses déclarations n'étaient pas réunis. La demanderesse renvoie à la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  où la juge Snider a établi les éléments nécessaires pour conclure qu'une personne devait être interdite de territoire pour fausses déclarations:
[27] Pour conclure qu'une personne doit être interdite de territoire, tel que prévu au paragraphe 40(1), il faut réunir deux éléments: cette personne doit avoir donné de fausses déclarations et ces fausses déclarations doivent porter sur un fait important et entraîner ou risquer d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la LIPR. La norme de contrôle applicable au premier de ces éléments est, à mon avis, le caractère manifestement déraisonnable. Il s'agit d'une décision sur les faits; or, l'agent des visas est celui qui est le mieux placé pour évaluer ces faits. Sans me prononcer sur le deuxième élément, je considère que la norme de contrôle applicable est le caractère raisonnable
simpliciter.
[49]
La norme de contrôle serait donc celle de la décision raisonnable, étant donné que les deux éléments sont des questions de fait: la demanderesse a-t-elle fait de fausses déclarations (sans nécessairement l'avoir fait intentionnellement) et ces fausses déclarations étaient-elles importantes en ce sens qu'elles auraient pu entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi? Comme la juge Snider l'a précisé dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'agent est celui qui est le mieux placé pour apprécier ces éléments.
[50]
Selon la position de la demanderesse, l'omission de divulguer que le demandeur principal n'était pas le père biologique du garçon ne constituait pas une présentation erronée d'un fait important parce que le garçon était par ailleurs une personne à charge ou un membre de la famille de fait (à titre de fils de l'épouse du demandeur principal). Le fait de ne pas avoir divulgué la vérité n'aurait pas entraîné d'erreur dans l'application de la Loi parce que la demanderesse et son fils auraient été admissibles et le visa aurait été délivré même si la vérité avait été connue.
[51]
La demanderesse souligne également que si la demande avait été rejetée en raison de fausses déclarations, les conséquences pour la famille du demandeur principal auraient été le prononcé d'une interdiction de territoire pour une période de deux ans, plutôt que les conséquences peut-être encore plus graves d'un refus aux termes de l'article 16.
[52]
La demanderesse ajoute que les faits de l'espèce sont particuliers. Les mensonges étaient innocents, et découlaient de mauvais conseils et du stress provoqué par le fait que l'épouse et le fils du demandeur principal se trouvaient encore en Inde, où ils étaient apatrides.
[53]
Bien que les observations de la demanderesse selon lesquelles les objectifs généraux du régime de protection des réfugiés du Canada reconnaissent que les demandeurs doivent parfois prendre des mesures radicales pour obtenir l'asile, y compris mentir, retenir des renseignements ou faire de fausses déclarations, aient été examinées, et bien que les circonstances de la demanderesse soient troublantes, je soulignerais que l'agent connaît bien les conditions ayant cours dans les pays d'origine des réfugiés et est chargé d'appliquer les dispositions de la Loi en vue de préserver l'esprit et l'intégrité de la Loi.
[54]
Comme nous l'avons vu, l'agent ne s'est pas appuyé sur l'article 40, qui porte sur les fausses déclarations, pour rejeter la demande de visa. En outre, la demanderesse a formulé une hypothèse en affirmant que si la vérité avait été connue, le visa aurait été délivré, étant donné que la décision de délivrer un visa est discrétionnaire, aux termes de l'article 11 de la Loi.
Équité procédurale
[55]
Je ne suis pas d'accord avec la demanderesse pour dire que l'agent a remis en question l'authenticité de son mariage sans lui donner la possibilité de réagir. Si l'agent a bien écrit, dans les notes du STIDI [traduction] « [V] oilà qui remet en question l'authenticité de la relation entre le demandeur principal (sic) et Norbu Tsering », la lecture de la décision dans son ensemble montre nettement que l'agent n'a pas rejeté la demande parce qu'il avait des doutes sur le mariage. Les notes du STIDI indiquent ensuite que le certificat de mariage est versé au dossier et qu'il s'agit d'une copie certifiée.
[56]
Par conséquent, aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale n'a été commis.
Question proposée aux fins de certification
[57]
La demanderesse propose la question suivante aux fins de certification:
Lorsqu'une réticence n'entraînerait pas d'erreur dans l'application de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, le paragraphe 176(3) du
Règlement
sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
limite-t-il le recours à l'article 16 de la Loi aux motifs d'interdiction de territoire applicables aux personnes à charge des réfugiés au sens de la Convention, quand la demande d'une telle personne à charge est traitée en même temps que la demande de résidence permanente du réfugié au sens de la Convention?
[58]
Le défendeur fait valoir que cette question ne permettrait pas de trancher la demande de contrôle judiciaire et qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une question d'importance générale.
[59]
Je trouve la question difficile à comprendre, car elle soulève des points qui ne découlent pas du libellé de l'article 16 de la Loi ni de celui du paragraphe 176(3) du Règlement. En outre, j'estime que la question ne permettrait pas de régler les questions en litige dont je suis saisie, parce que l'agent n'a pas rejeté la demande de visa en se fondant sur la réticence et les fausses déclarations qui sont visées par l'article 40. L'agent s'est fondé sur les articles 16 et 11. L'article 16 ne mentionne pas de motifs d'interdiction de territoire précis ni n'est limité par de tels motifs; il indique plutôt que le demandeur doit dire la vérité et produire tous les documents pertinents et requis. L'article 11 précise qu'un visa peut être délivré quand deux critères sont satisfaits: le demandeur n'est pas interdit de territoire, et le demandeur se conforme à la Loi. Par conséquent, la question proposée ne traite pas de la décision rendue en l'espèce.
[60]
En conclusion, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. La décision de l'agent était raisonnable; elle était transparente et intelligible, et pouvait se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
Comme il a été mentionné ci-dessus, la question proposée ne se prête pas à la certification.
