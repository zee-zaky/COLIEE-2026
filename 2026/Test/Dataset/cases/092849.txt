Dubé, J.
: The defendants' motion seeks to have the action instituted against the Ship "Lina Erre" dismissed and her arrest declared invalid.
[2]
The essential facts can be summarized as follows. A collision involving the "Lina Erre" (at the time the "Pacos") occurred in the harbour of Piraeus, Greece, on January 11, 1987. At the time, the vessel was registered in Panama. On January 28, 1987, the ownership of the vessel changed and the transfer was properly registered in Italy. The vessel was arrested in Montreal on December 13, 1988, by the plaintiff, owner of the vessel "Reefer Manggis" damaged in the collision. The plaintiff is a Bahamian Corporation. Security was given by the defendants on December 23, 1988, and the ship was released from arrest on that day by order of the Federal Court of Canada.
[3]
It is common ground that the Federal Court has jurisdiction in the matter and that there exists a maritime lien against a vessel involved in a collision under either Canadian, Greek, Italian or Panamanian law. The real issue is which law does apply. That question must be answered so as to determine whether or not the right of arrest under the maritime lien was extinguished or time-barred at the time of the arrest in Montreal on December 13, 1988, when there had been a change of ownership between the date of the accident and the date of the arrest.
[4]
Under Canadian law, there is a two year delay for instituting an action arising from a collision even when a change of ownership has intervened, as prescribed by s. 645 of the Canada Shipping Act. However, Canadian courts will look to the law of the country wherein the maritime lien arose or was created so as to determine the status of the lien (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), affirmed [1987] 1 S.C.R. 57; 72 N.R. 75; Tetley, Maritime Liens and Claims (1985), at pages 529 and 530 (States that Canadian courts will only recognize substantive foreign law); Thomas, Maritime Liens (1980), pp. 320-322; Castel, Canadian Conflict of Law (1975), pp. 608-611, especially 609, 618-619; and Dicey and Morris, The Conflict of Laws (10th Ed.), pp. 1179-1182, especially at p. 1181; Fourth Cumulative Supplement to the 10th Edition, 1985, p. 101.
[5]
However, s. 275 of the Canada Shipping Act provides that in the case of a conflict of laws the law of the port where the ship is registered would apply. The section does not specify whether it refers to the port of registry at the time of the collision (in this case, Panama) or at the time of the arrest (Italy).
[6]
It appears from the evidence of the legal experts filed in this motion that the right to exercise the maritime lien was extinguished, or time-barred, when the vessel was arrested in Montreal, whether Greek, Italian or Panamanian law is applied.
[7]
Mr. Arghiris Koutsoucos, of the Associated Piraeus Law Offices, states that under Greek law a maritime lien will arise in respect of a collision (article 205 of the Greek Code of Private Maritime Law). The maritime lien will attach to the res even after it has been sold into the hands of a bona fide purchaser for value (combined interpretation of articles 205 and 207 of the C.P.M.L.). But an action must be brought within three months from the date of registration of the contract of sale in the ship's registry (article 207 of the C.P.M.L.). The expert writes as follows:
"If in spite of the transfer of the res into a new ownership no action is brought against the new owner within (3) months from the date of registration of the Bill of Sale the claim may no longer be enforced against the res and/or the new owners and must be enforced in personam against the previous owners."
[8]
The vessel was sold and ownership transferred and registered in Italy in January 1987 and the action was taken some eleven months later.
[9]
Mr. GR J. Timagenis, Senior Partner of a Piraeus Law Office agrees with Mr. Koutsoucos and states that article 207 of the C.P.M.L. provides that the three month period starts from the time of the registration of the contract of transfer with the ship's registry, but refers primarily to cases of transfer of ownership without change of flag. It does apply to such cases, however, with one exception:
"... If a foreign vessel (burdened with a maritime lien) is registered with the Greek Registry under a new ownership, then article 207 applies and the maritime lien will be extinguished within three months unless an action is filed within this period for the enforcement of the lien. If on the contrary, a Greek ship (burdened with a maritime lien) changes flag and ownership, it is the law of the new flag which will determine for how long the (pre-existing) maritime lien will survive and under what conditions.
"Consequently, it is my considered opinion that, although Greek Courts would look at the law of Panama to determine whether or not there was a maritime lien at the time of the collision, they would look to Italian law, the law of the country of registry of the vessel at the time the maritime lien was exercised, to determine the delay within which to exercise the maritime lien. This opinion derives directly from article 9 of the Greek Code of Private Maritime Law which provides that the rights in rem on a ship are determined by the Law of the flag of the ship."
[10]
Therefore, under Greek conflict of laws, Greek courts would apply Italian law, that is the law of the port of registry at the time of the arrest.
[11]
At the time of the collision the vessel was flying a Panamanian flag. Under domestic Panamanian law, maritime liens on a vessel lapse six months from the date of the permanent recording of the new title in the public ship's registry, according to the written opinion of Mr. Woodrow De Castro of the legal firm De Castro & Robles, Panama. He writes as follows:
"As per Article 1508 of the Panamanian Code of Commerce, a maritime lien on a vessel is extinguished by the judicial sale of that vessel. A private sale of the vessel transfers her ownership to the purchaser subject to the maritime liens thereon. However, maritime liens on a vessel including collision maritime liens lapse six months from the date of the permanent recording of the new title in the public ship registry, unless the creditor within that period of time has initiated judicial proceedings for the recognition of its lien."
[12]
Under the Panamanian conflict of laws, Panamanian courts would apply the law of Italy being the law of the country of registry at the time of the exercise of the maritime lien according to Mr. De Castro.
[13]
Under domestic Italian law, a maritime lien expires 60 days after the registration of the contract of sale or one year after the date of the casualty, even where no transfer of ownership has taken place, according to the written opinion of Mr. Kristian Kielland of the law firm Balestra, Kielland, Dardani of Genova, Italy. He says that according to article 552, no. 5 of the Italian Code of Navigation a collision claim is assisted by a maritime lien and according to article 559 a maritime lien expires 60 days after the registration of the contract of sale in the ship's registry and, in any event, according to article 558, a maritime lien for a collision claim expires one year after the date of the casualty even if there is no transfer of ownership.
[14]
It would therefore appear that, whether Greek, Italian or Panamanian law is applied, the instant maritime lien had expired and therefore the right to arrest was extinguished when the vessel was arrested in Montreal on December 13, 1988.
[15]
There remains, however, a corollary question namely whether the right to exercise a maritime lien is substantive, as Canadian courts will only recognize substantive foreign law (see Tetley, Maritime Liens and Claims, supra, para. 4. Under our laws the right to exercise a maritime lien is substantive (see Tetley, at page 531). According to the written opinion of Mr. Koutsoucos of Piraeus the right to exercise a maritime lien is also substantive under Greek law. It is also substantive under Italian law as confirmed by Mr. Kielland: "All the time bars provided by articles 487, 558 and 559 of the Italian Code of Navigation are substantive". No opinion was obtained on this point from the Panamanian legal expert, and none will be necessary.
[16]
Consequently, I find that this court must look to the law of Greece where the maritime lien arose. Greek law would apply Italian law, the law of the port of registry at the time of the arrest. Under Italian law the lien had expired.
[17]
I find, therefore, that the arrest of the vessel was invalid and hold that the action against her is dismissed with costs.
Order accordingly.
