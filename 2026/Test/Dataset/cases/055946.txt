Dubé, J.
: This appeal pursuant to s. 56 of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, is from the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board ("the Registrar") rejecting the appellant's ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) application to register the trademark "Club Ale & Design" for use in association with ale, as illustrated below.
[See printed version]
[2]
Application no. 314,762 was launched on July 16, 1968, by Formosa Spring Brewery Limited, a predecessor in title to Molson, based upon use since at least as early as May 1, 1968. The application was amended to include a disclaimer to all reading matter except the word "Club". Molson already is, and was at all material times, the owner of the trademark "Club", registration no. 160,974 for use in association with ale, issued January 31, 1969, which remains in good standing on the trademarks register (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 311 (F.C.T.D.); affd. (June 4, 1992) A-1144-88 (F.C.A.)).
[3]
On August 28, 1969, a statement of opposition was filed on behalf of Pelissier's Brewery Limited, the predecessor in interest of the respondent herein ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The opposition was based on the three following grounds:
(1) the mark is not registrable under the provisions of s. 12(1)(d) of the
Act
, as it is confusing with Labatt's registration no. 116,574 (reproduced below);
[See printed version]
(2) the applicant is not the person entitled to registration having regard to the provisions of s. 16(1)(a) of the
Act
and the prior use by Labatt of the above trademark;
(3) the mark is not distinctive.
1. The First Ground Of Opposition:
[4]
It appears therefore that Labatt's opposition was largely founded upon its own "Country Club & Design" trademark which was applied for on September 27, 1958, claiming use since May 1957 and registered on January 15, 1960.
[5]
However, at the request of Molson, the Registrar commenced expungement proceedings against Labatt's "Country Club & Design" trademark on August 16, 1971, and, after two appeals, it was ordered expunged by the Federal Court of Appeal on October 19, 1983 (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; affd. (1983), 75 C.P.R.(2d) 287). The "Country Club & Design" trademark was officially expunged by the Registrar on March 1, 1984. Nevertheless, the trademark office did not amend the register so as to give effect to the said order until March 15, 1991.
[6]
The Registrar's decision under appeal was released on January 31, 1991. Dealing with the first ground of opposition, he relied on the jurisprudence as it was at the time, namely that "the material time for considering the circumstances is as of the filing of the opposition". He therefore rejected Molson's submission that Labatt was precluded from relying on its own registration no. 116,574 which was subsequently ordered expunged by the Federal Court after August 28, 1969, the date of filing of Labatt's opposition. He noted that he "reviewed the trademarks register and, notwithstanding the court decision, registration No. 116,574 remains in good standing". He goes on to say that "in any event, even if the opponent's registration had been subsequently expunged, I would still be obliged to consider the opponent's first ground of opposition since the registration was in good standing as of the filing of the opposition".
[7]
The Registrar, in considering the opponent's first ground, rightly stated that the onus or legal burden is on the applicant (Molson) to show no reasonable likelihood of confusion. He then proceeded to apply the five tests for confusion set out in s. 6(5) of the
Act
, so as to find out whether or not there was likelihood of confusion between the two trademarks, that is Molson's "Club Ale & Design" and Labatt's "Country Club & Design", and came to the conclusion that the applicant "has failed to satisfy the onus on it to show that its applied for mark is not confusing with the registered mark 'Country Club & Design'". He held that since the first ground of opposition was successful, there was no necessity for him to consider the other two grounds.
[8]
Shortly after the decision of the Registrar was released, and subsequent to the filing of the amended notice of appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal followed
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 29, reversing the well-established jurisprudence and determined that the material date in an opposition to registrability is not the date when the opposition is filed but the date upon which the opposition is disposed of on the evidence adduced (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 413 (F.C.A.)). The
Park Avenue
decision came down on June 24, 1991.
[9]
The operative paragraph of the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
Park Avenue
, written by Madame Justice Desjardins, reads as follows:
"In an opposition to registrability, the view adopted by Heald, J.A., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> appears to me to be the most logical one. I find no fallacy in the possibility of an update of the situation by the parties when the issue is whether statutory recognition should be given to a mark. It is important, it would seem to me, that the decision of the Registrar or the court be taken on an accurate state of the record. Registrability should be decided at the date of registration or at the date of refusal of registration.
"The relevant date, in the case at bar, was the day the Registrar disposed of the opposition on the evidence adduced, i.e., December 31, 1987."
[10]
It would appear therefore that under the law, as it now stands, the relevant date in an opposition to registrability would be the day the Registrar disposes of the opposition, in the instant case January 31, 1991. If that be so, the Registrar was clearly wrong in his finding of confusion with a trademark which, at that late date, was expunged.
[11]
Consequently, I must now consider the other two grounds of opposition which were not canvassed by the Registrar.
2. The Second Ground Of Opposition:
[12]
The second ground asserted by Labatt is that Molson is not the person entitled to registration: as of May 1, 1968, the date in which Molson first used its trademark "Club Ale & Design", it was confusing with Labatt's trademark "Country Club & Design" which Labatt had previously used in Canada in association with the sale of beer and which trademark had not been abandoned.
[13]
The issue of confusion arising under s. 16(1)(a) of the
Act
must be determined as of the date the applicant's trademark was first used which in this case is May 1, 1968, by a predecessor of Molson. In determining whether two trademarks are confusing regard must be had to all surrounding circumstances including those specifically enumerated under s. 6(5) of the
Trade-marks Act
which the Registrar did in the course of his analysis under the first ground of opposition. It will be recalled that he came to the conclusion that Molson had failed to satisfy the onus on it to show that there was no confusion with the registered mark "Country Club & Design". It is apparent from the reasons of the Registrar that he was largely persuaded by his perception of the degree of resemblance between the marks and the identical nature of the wares and trades.
[14]
Counsel for Molson argues that, in comparing design or label trademarks, regard must be had to all the elements of the labels: the sole fact that both labels display a common word and design component is not sufficient to carry a finding of confusion (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  by side it is immediately obvious that the trademarks display only one similar element, namely the word "Club", and the Registrar failed to attach sufficient weight to the fact that Molson is the owner of the trademark "Club" which is the dominant feature. In both trademarks, the word "Club" is an element found in combination with various other words and design components in many trademarks used in association with alcoholic beverages: and a word which is common to the trade is entitled to a very narrow ambit of protection and comparatively small differences are deemed sufficient to avoid confusion (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 46 (T.D.); H.G. Fox,
The Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition
(3rd Ed. 1972) (Toronto: Carswell), at p. 173;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (25 March 1992), Ottawa, T-3125-90 (F.C.T.D.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.)).
[15]
According to Molson, the dominant design of its mark is a stylized depiction of a playing card symbol, whereas the dominant design feature of Labatt's mark is the "barbershop pole" symbols located on each of the two sides. In fact, there is evidence that Labatt's label was frequently referred to as the "barbershop" label by its own affiants. Although the Labatt trademark incorporates a small black trefoil design, the test is one of overall impression left by the marks in the mind of the consumer: the combination of elements is so different as to preclude the possibility of confusion.
[16]
As to the idea suggested, counsel for Molson argues that Molson's mark combines the black trefoil playing card symbol for the suit known as clubs, with the word mark "Club". This combination connotes only one thing, namely, the playing card symbol. On the other hand, Labatt's trademark is far more suggestive of a country club atmosphere where people gather to drink beer and do other remarkable things.
[17]
At page 6 of his decision the Registrar made the following assumption:
"A beer consumer in August of 1969 already familiar with beer sold in association with the trademark 'Country Club & Design' could easily assume that the applicant's 'Club Ale & Design' mark is merely an updated or modernized version of the registered mark."
Counsel for Molson suggests that, in the absence of any evidence from beer consumers, this inference was wrongly arrived at: it does not constitute a fact so notorious as not to be the subject of dispute amongst reasonable men or capable of immediate accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy (D.W. Scott,
Evidence in Trademark Cases
, 60 C.P.R. 28 and
Black's Law Dictionary
(5th Ed.) (St. Paul: West Publishing Co. 1979)).
[18]
I am not convinced that the Registrar was wrong in finding that the Molson trademark was confusing with the Labatt trademark. Although he made that decision under the first ground of registrability under s. 12(1)(d) of the
Act
, he would necessarily have found the same likelihood of confusion had he considered the question of entitlement under s. 16(1)(a) of the
Act
. The Registrar's decision on the issue of likelihood of confusion constitutes a finding of fact which ought not to be disturbed on appeal, unless he clearly erred and the burden of proof is on the appellant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) to show that it did err. In my view, there is certainly enough resemblance between both marks to support a decision that confusion may be created in the mind of the beer drinker (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 44;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CP.R.(3d) 101).
[19]
Counsel for Molson also makes the point that it is somewhat anomalous for a trademark owner, who has lost his registration for want of use, to still maintain an opposition on the basis of that registration. She notes that Labatt's "Country Club & Design" was ordered expunged on March 26, 1980, following a s. 44 notice. She quotes Addy, J., from the aforementioned
Benson & Hedges
decision at page 36:
"Mr. Pearson, the Comptroller of the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission, states in his affidavit that Pelissier's Brewery Limited ceased officially to market its 'Country Club' brand and replaced it with 'Manitoba Club'
on May 11, 1969
, that no one since then has been marketing 'Country Club' in the province and, more importantly, that, because of the involved process for marketing beer in that jurisdiction, it would be virtually impossible for anyone to sell a brand of beer without the Commission's knowledge. In support of this, he gives in detail the process of marketing beer through the Commission.
"All of the evidence in favour of the appellant's position, including the documentary evidence,
points categorically to the very great probability of the mark not having been used in any way since 1969
." (My emphasis)
[20]
She therefore contends that under ss. 16(5) and 17(1) of the
Act
, an opponent must initially discharge the legal and evidential burden of establishing it had not abandoned the trademark relied upon in challenging the applicant's entitlement to registration of its trademark (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 45 (T.D.)).
[21]
Since the material date for abandonment is the date of advertisement of the opposed trademark application under ss. 16(5) and 17(1) of the
Act
, Labatt must satisfy the legal and evidential burden upon it to establish nonabandonment of its alleged trademark as of May 28, 1969.
[22]
In his affidavit Mr. Kelsey, Director and Secretary Treasurer of Pellisier Brewery Limited and Secretary of Labatt's Manitoba Brewery, deposed that Pelissier used the trademark "Country Club & Design" in Canada continuously from May 1957, to the date the affidavit was sworn, namely April 21, 1971.
[23]
However, Labatt's own evidence establishes that the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission was its only customer: in that province all beer sales must go through the provincial Commission. And, according to Mr. Garnet H. Pearson of the Commission, Labatt ceased to offer "Country Club & Design" beer through the Commission on May 11, 1969. That same affidavit of Mr. Pearson led Addy, J., to his aforementioned conclusion that "all the evidence ... points categorically to a very great probability of the mark not having been used in any way since 1969".
[24]
On the other hand, counsel for Labatt, while agreeing that the crucial date for nonentitlement is the date of advertisement of Molson's application (May 28, 1969), he asserts that the subject matter of the now expunged registration no. 116,574 was not abandoned at that stage but still remained in use. He claims that the fact that the trademark "Country Club & Design" was expunged pursuant to s. 45 (formerly s. 44) is irrelevant to the entitlement issue, first, because the evidence that was filed in respect of the s. 45 proceedings differed materially from the evidence filed in the instant proceedings; and secondly, because a determination pursuant to s. 45 does not, in any event, constitute a determination on the issue of abandonment (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 136). He argues that for the past 34 years in Manitoba, the word "Club" was used with beer, on beer bottles, then on kegs, then on drum caps: the label was also being updated.
[25]
The provisions governing entitlement to registration, ss. 16(1), 16(5) and 17(1) of the
Act
, raise the following issues in the instant case:
"(1) Was Molson's trademark 'Club Ale & Design' confusing with Labatt's trademark 'Country Club & Design' as of the date Molson's trademark was first used in Canada by its predecessor in title Formosa on May 1, 1968, pursuant to s. 16(1)?
"(2) If no to (1), then this ground of Labatt's opposition must fail.
"(3) If yes to (1), Molson's right to secure registration of its trademark 'Club Ale & Design' will not be affected
if
Labatt had abandoned its trademark 'Country Club & Design' at the date of the advertisement of Molson's application, May 28, 1969, pursuant to s. 16(5)."
[26]
If it is found that Molson's trademark "Club Ale & Design" was indeed confusing with Labatt's trademark "Country Club & Design" as of May 1, 1968, then, pursuant to s. 17(1) of the
Act
, the burden rests with Labatt to establish that it had not abandoned its trademark "Country Club & Design" as of the date of the advertisement of Molson's application on May 28, 1969.
[27]
I have already found that there is enough resemblance between the two marks in question to support a decision that confusion may have been created in the mind of the beer drinker as of the date of Molson's first use on May 1, 1968. Thus, I must now turn to the application of ss. 16(5) and 17(1) of the
Act
dealing with abandonment.
[28]
Abandonment of a trademark is a question of fact which must be decided on the merits of each case in view of all the surrounding circumstances. It is well-established that the mere nonuse of a trademark does not create abandonment in and of itself. In order to find that a trademark has indeed been abandoned, the nonuse of the trademark in question must be accompanied with an intention to abandon said trademark (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 289 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 311 (T.D.)).
[29]
It has been clearly demonstrated by virtue of the decision of Addy, J., expunging Labatt's trademark in the
Benson & Hedges
decision that Labatt's trademark "Country Club & Design" had not been used "in any way since 1969". Sections 16(5) and 17(1) of the
Act
are clear: the material date to show abandonment of a confusing trademark is the date of the advertisement of the application, which in the present case was May 28, 1969.
[30]
However, having found "nonuse" by Labatt of its trademark "Country Club & Design", we must now turn to the question of whether it was also Labatt's "intention to abandon" said trademark at the time in question. Evidence of this fact has not been made by the decision of Addy, J., since the question of abandonment was not before him in those proceedings. Therefore, has Labatt filed evidence in the present proceedings which demonstrates that it was not its intention to abandon its trademark "Country Club & Design" at the date of the advertisement of Molson's application on May 28, 1969?
[31]
Labatt argued that two weeks prior to the filing of Molson's application, Labatt changed the label on its bottled beer from the "Country Club & Design" label to the "Manitoba's Club & Design" label. Labatt claims it continued its practice of applying the mark, which was initially a bottle label, to kegs of beer for the purpose of enabling people to know which brand of beer was being sold in the kegs. Notwithstanding Mr. Pearson's testimony to the effect that Labatt ceased to offer "Country Club & Design" beer through the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission on May 11, 1969, Labatt claims that the label has been in continuous use since it was first adopted in 1957 and remains in use. Sometimes it is used on bottles and sometimes it is used on kegs, but in all cases it was used to identify the beer being sold in either the bottles or the kegs.
[32]
Reference is made to Dr. Fox,
The Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition
(3rd Ed. Toronto: Carswell, 1972), at pages 280-281:
"
Mere Nonuse Insufficient
: Mere nonuse of a trademark is not of itself sufficient to create abandonment for nonuse may be satisfactorily explained. There must be present intention to abandon. As was said by Chitty in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the goods; it would be absurd to suppose he lost his trademark by not putting more goods on the market when it was glutted'.
"
Intention:
If, of course, as well as discontinuing to deal in the goods in question, the proprietor of the mark ceases to have any intention of dealing in the goods, that would entail an abandonment of the mark. An intention may be inferred from long disuse. So also, the adoption of new marks may show an intention to abandon an older and unused mark, but such is not conclusive. The test is one of reputation based upon user; mere intention to preserve the name or mark is not sufficient.
"... Abandonment is in each case a question of fact, to be determined according to the circumstances of each particular case and depending on the evidence of intention to abandon. A man will not be held to have abandoned his rights unless the court comes to the conclusion that he intended to do so.
"The maintenance of a trademark on the register, and its renewal as required by statute, may be some evidence of an intention not to abandon. But such evidence is not controlling. Those steps may indeed show an intention to keep registration alive, but the intention with which abandonment is concerned is that of using the mark in connection with particular goods. Use by a registered user is proof against an allegation of abandonment.
"Questions of abandonment may also arise where a trademark is not used in the form in which it is registered, deviations from such form or additions thereto persuading the court the use made of a particular trademark is not such as to fall within the definition of use provided by the statute."
[33]
Labatt further argues that the Registrar, in his decision at page 6, found that "the evidence of record illustrates brewers' penchant for periodically changing and updating their product labels": labels may be modified or updated, or there may be a change in title or mark.
[34]
According to Labatt, Molson, or its predecessor in title, never used the word "Club" combined with a club symbol until they adopted the present "Club Ale & Design" mark. Labatt submits that if Molson had continued using the mark "Club", without the symbol, there never would have been any dispute.
[35]
Labatt submits that, since at least the thirties, it has used "Country Club" in various forms. But the evidence shows that Labatt changed its label for bottled beer to "Manitoba's Club & Design" and it was sold as such by the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission as of May 11, 1969. According to the evidence of Mr. Pearson, no bottled beer has since that date been marketed under the mark "Country Club & Design" in Manitoba. Mr. Kelsey conceded in cross-examination on his affidavit filed in these proceedings that it would be virtually impossible for a brand of beer to be marketed in the Province of Manitoba without the knowledge of the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission. In the expungement proceedings, he stated that it was Labatt's policy to employ the unused "Country Club & Design" beer bottle labels remaining over, after the end of 1969, for the purpose of identifying beer shipped in kegs to licensees. On that score, Addy, J., had this to say (at page 36):
"... it seems obvious that he really had no actual knowledge of whether 'Country Club' labels were ever put on the beer kegs subsequent to the latter part of 1969. He based his statements as to use entirely on his apparent knowledge that it was the company's stated policy to do so and that such policy was put into effect because there was a surplus of 'Country Club' labels left over and they were to be put to use for purely economic reasons."
[36]
And at page 38 he continues as follows:
"... The witness was also unable to produce any documentary evidence of any kind as to the existence of that policy nor was he able to state whether any documentary proof had ever existed. There was no direct evidence on behalf of the owner of one single incident of actual use after 1969."
[37]
The evidence filed in the instant proceedings from Labatt employees as to the actual use of labels at the relevant time is of no assistance as it is uncertain and at times contradictory.
[38]
The mere fact that Labatt, or its predecessor, may have used the remaining "Country Club & Design" labels in stock on kegs (a practice which was subsequently discontinued in favour of a coloured bung system) is not necessarily an indication that it intended to maintain the trademark, but could have been as well a economic way to finally dispose of the last labels. Addy, J., did not consider that disposal policy as being a show of use and I do not view it as an indication of intent not to abandon the trademark.
[39]
On the evidence adduced at the proceedings before the Registrar and before me, I must find that Labatt failed to show that, at the time of the advertisement of Molson's application on May 28, 1969, it did not have the intention to abandon its mark "Country Club & Design". Having said this, Labatt's second ground of opposition must also fail.
3. The Third Ground Of Opposition:
[40]
As to the third ground of opposition, distinctiveness, Labatt argued that Molson's trademark is not distinctive in that the records of the trademarks office show that the word "Club" is very common in registered trademarks relating to alcoholic brewery beverages.
[41]
The material date for determining distinctiveness is the date of filing of the statement of opposition, August 28, 1969 (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 45, at p. 585 F.C. (T.D.);
Triple G  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 197 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ground that a trademark is not distinctive under s. 38(2)(d) he bears an evidential burden to show that its own mark is known to some extent (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 155). The fact that Molson's trademark "Club Ale & Design" was confusing with Labatt's trademark "Country Club & Design" on the date of first use on May 1, 1968, does not necessarily lead one to the conclusion that Molson's trademark was "not distinctive" on the date of filing of Labatt's opposition on August 28, 1969. The two are separate grounds of opposition under the
Act
.
[42]
The definition of "distinctiveness" is found in s. 2 of the
Act
and reads as follows:
"'distinctiveness', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that, actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted as to distinguish them;"
[43]
The function and purpose of a trademark is to indicate the source of the goods. A trademark by definition must be and remain distinctive of a single source. Therefore, distinctiveness requires that:
(1) a mark and a product be associated;
(2) the owner uses this association between the mark and its product and is manufacturing and selling this product; and
(3) this association enables the owner to distinguish its product from that of others (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is distinctive is a question that can only be settled by considering the whole of the circumstances of the case. To use the words of Dr. Fox, supra, at page 27:
"In considering distinctiveness it is not proper to dissect a mark and to examine its component parts. It is the combination of the elements that constitutes a trademark and gives distinctiveness to it and it is the effect of the trademark as a whole - the totality - ratherthan any particular element in it that must be considered."
[45]
Also, in order to satisfy the test of "distinctiveness", it is not sufficient that a trademark is merely distinctive in particular channels of trade, i.e. to the manufacturer and wholesaler. The trademark must be distinctive to all probable purchasers which includes the ultimate consumer (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  75).
[46]
In my view, the subject label clearly indicates the source of the product and the affidavit evidence provides sufficient proof of use by the predecessor in title of the subject trademark in association with beer to meet the onus upon the applicant to show that the trademark distinguishes its wares from those of others. The evidence of John F. Osterman, Vice-President, Controller, Molson Breweries of Canada Ltd., shows clearly (1) that beer was sold in association with the trademark in question in the Province of Ontario in substantial quantities during the period between 1968 and 1974, and (2) that the beer sold in association with the trademark in question has been widely advertised in the Province of Ontario. Moreover, the Registrar reviewed the state of the register and was correct in concluding (at page 7):
"... that consumers were accustomed to seeing marks including the word 'Club' for alcoholic beverages and would, at least to some extent, distinguish such marks on the basis of their additional features."
[47]
I therefore find that Molson's trademark was distinctive as of the date of filing of the opposition on August 28, 1969. The fact that Molson's label was subsequently altered has no bearing on the issue as to whether it was distinctive as of the date of the filing of Labatt's opposition. Therefore, Labatt's third and final ground of opposition must also fail.
[48]
Consequently, the appeal is allowed, with costs.
Appeal allowed.
