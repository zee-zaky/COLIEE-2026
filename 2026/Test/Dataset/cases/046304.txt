Brown, J.
: This is an application for judicial review by Adriana Lucia Sanchez Mestre, Alberto Enrique Ordonez Florez and Melissa Ordonez Sanchez [the Applicants] under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Refugee Protection Division [RPD], rendered orally on November 21, 2013, wherein the RPD determined that the Applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. For the reasons that follow the application is granted.
I.
Facts
[2]
Adriana Lucia Sanchez Mestre was born on October 5, 1984. Her husband, Alberto Enrique Ordonez Florez, was born on November 19, 1978. Their daughter, Melissa Ordonez Sanchez, was born on May 9, 2010. They are citizens of Colombia. The Applicants made the following allegations in support of their refugee claims, all of which were found truthful and credible by the RPD:
1. Ms. Sanchez is a General Physician and worked at the ESE Cartagena de Indias as a family doctor from February 16, 2011 to March 15, 2013. On November 9, 2012, she attended a patient for an emergency due to an injury to the left leg. The man, accompanied by two men, came back on November 12, 2012 and November 16, 2012 for checkups. On November 19, 2012, one of the accompanying men came back and asked for a home visit for the patient because he was in pain. There, the two men said that the patient was fine, that they were from the
Ejército de Liberación Nacional
(the National Liberation Army) [ELN] and needed her as a doctor to provide services in some of their locations. Ms. Sanchez said it was not possible for her and left.
2. On November 28, 2012, Ms. Sanchez received an anonymous letter asking her for her answer and telling her that the time was almost up for her to provide them with her answer. Ms. Sanchez was afraid and took a vacation to see if things would calm down. She visited the United States with her daughter, mother and brother from December 1, 2012 to December 10, 2012. She returned to work on December 11, 2012.
3. On January 9, 2013, one of the men came to the Health Centre and asked for Ms. Sanchez. She evaded him. She then saw the men on different occasions in the street but they did not approach her. The Nurse Assistant told Ms. Sanchez that some other men were coming to the house and were friends with the police in that area. For that reason, Ms. Sanchez did not report these incidents to the police. She started receiving phone calls and messages from unknown numbers, asking her to go with them and that she would face consequences if the answer was negative. They told her not to approach authorities or things would be worse. Ms. Sanchez stayed calm because she did not know how serious the situation was and thought the situation would be temporary at that time.
4. On January 29, 2013, Ms. Sanchez received an article at her office reporting the murder of her university classmate. She feared the ELN sent her that article as a warning.
5. On February 4, 2013, Ms. Sanchez requested a transfer in writing but she was later advised that there were no vacancies available elsewhere. She again requested a transfer on February 13, 2013 and February 22, 2013 but did not get an answer.
6. On March 6, 2013, Ms. Sanchez received a phone call telling her that her time was up, that they knew she was married, that there would be consequences for her and her family, and not to contact authorities. She resigned from her position on March 15, 2013 and her husband supported her. The Applicants went to Medellin on March 23, 2013 to keep far from the city for a week. Ms. Sanchez received a phone call on March 26, 2013 telling her that nobody plays with them, that her life was in danger and that there would be consequences. The Applicants returned to Cartagena on March 31, 2013 and they sent their daughter to stay with Ms. Sanchez's mother and would only visit her on the weekends.
7. On April 26, 2013, Ms. Sanchez received an anonymous letter which said that they knew where she was, that they will find her, and not to report to the authorities. The Applicants moved to Ms. Sanchez's mother-in-law's home for two weeks.
8. Ms. Sanchez started to attend psychological therapies on May 18, 2013 because the situation was affecting her. On June 4, 2013, she recognized one of the men in the mall near her house. She and her husband moved out of the house. This happened on different occasions and the threatening phone calls kept occurring. Ms. Sanchez was desperate and did not know where to go. She returned to her mother-in-law's house on June 26, 2013 and started searching for places, but found that places in Colombia were not safe as the ELN has control around the country and in the big cities where Ms. Sanchez can work. She researched online and called her father in Canada. The Applicants decided that Canada was the best option. Ms. Sanchez abandoned her house on August 6, 2013, only took her personal belongings, and moved to her mother's house, where she would only go out of the house to attend her psychological appointments.
9. Ms. Sanchez also testified that she feared the
Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia
(the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) [FARC] because they work closely with the ELN.
[3]
The Applicants entered Canada from the United States as an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement Ms. Sanchez's father is in Canada.
[4]
The RPD rejected the Applicants' claims on November 21, 2013. They filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review which was granted January 5, 2015. In the interim this Court stayed the Applicants removal to Colombia May 14, 2014.
II.
Decision under Review
[5]
The RPD accepted the Applicants' evidence as set out above as true; the Applicants were found credible. The RPD also found that Ms. Sanchez was at risk, as a physician, because she fits the profile of a person who would be targeted for forced recruitment at the hands of guerilla groups such as ELN and FARC. The RPD also found that her husband fits the profile of a person that would be targeted due to familial connection.
[6]
The RPD noted that the presumption of state protection applied to Colombia and that the Applicants therefore had to rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the state is unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection. The Applicants had to show that they have taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to seek protection in their country before seeking international protection unless it was objectively unreasonable to expect them to do so.
[7]
The RPD noted that the Applicants testified that they did not approach the state for protection because they were afraid and said that one cannot rebut the presumption of state protection by asserting only a subjective reluctance to engage the state.
[8]
The RPD acknowledged that some problems exist in Colombia but held that Columbia was making serious efforts to combat those problems and that those efforts have been effective. Namely, the RPD noted from the documentary evidence that "[t]he military has re-established security along most main roads in the country and increased the presence of police in most municipalities" and that "[t]he Canadian embassy's political councillor notes that urban security has improved dramatically in the last eight years."
[9]
The RPD then found that, having considered the totality of the evidence before it, the Applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The RPD was not persuaded that Colombia would not be reasonably forthcoming with state protection should the Applicants seek it, and consequently rejected the Applicants' claims.
III.
Issues
[10]
This matter raises the issue of whether the RPD erred in its finding that the Applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection?
IV.
Standard of Review
[11]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Supreme Court of Canada held that a standard of review analysis is unnecessary where "the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question." It is well established that reasonableness is the applicable standard of review to findings relating to state protection, as these are questions of mixed fact and law which, given the RPD's expertise on this subject matter, attracts deference:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47, the Supreme Court of Canada explained what is required of a court reviewing on the reasonableness standard of review:
A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
V.
Submissions of the Parties and Analysis
[12]
The Applicants note that the RPD relied on only one document, a 2011
Immigration and Refugee Board Response to Information Request
, to support its conclusion that state protection would be available in Colombia for them. The Applicants submit that there was copious documentary before the RPD that established that state protection is inadequate in Colombia, pointing to the 2009
Country Conditions in Colombia Relating to Asylum Claims in Canada
by Dr. Marc Chernick who has been recognized as an expert by the RPD in the past, a 2010 Special Report entitled "Continued Insecurity: Documenting the Permanence of the FARC-EP within the Context of Colombia's Civil War" by James J. Brittain, the 2010
Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Colombia
, and the 2011 report by the Canadian Council for Refugees.
[13]
The Applicants submit that the RPD erred for four reasons: 1) it ignored key evidence, cited above, which contradicted its conclusions; 2) it relied on the fact that the Applicants did not seek out state protection in Colombia; 3) it failed to provide any reasoning as to why she preferred the one document over the others; and 4) the one document it relied upon was read selectively.
[14]
I acknowledge the presumption that tribunals are presumed to have considered the entire record before them (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). While I also recognize the RPD is not obliged to refer to every piece of evidence before it (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), the RPD's reasons in this particular case are seriously lacking.
[15]
Because state protection was the only issue in the present case, and since the main ground for rejecting the Applicants' claims was the RPD's finding that state protection would be forthcoming if they had approached authorities, the RPD should have provided at least some reasoning regarding the evidence that directly contradicted this conclusion. I note that the contradictory evidence submitted by the Applicants, which the Applicants both referred in part at the hearing and specifically asked the RPD to consider, not only corroborated the Applicants' testimony that they were at risk, but also corroborated their decision not to seek out state protection out of fear of corruption by the authorities. I agree with the Applicants that this is a case where "a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 17 (FC)) and where, "when there is relevant contradictory evidence that is unacknowledged by the decision-maker, a reviewing Court may conclude that the Board ignored or misapprehended key facts and came to an erroneous decision" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). On this basis and in accordance with jurisprudence, I find that this aspect of the RPD's decision falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[16]
Given the finding of credibility and the corroborating evidence to the effect that a request for state protection would be futile, I also agree with the Applicant that there was no need to seek state protection just to prove that point. The law in this regard is comprehensively stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the seminal decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 724, where La Forest J. stated for a unanimous Court:
Moreover, it would seem to defeat the purpose of international protection if a claimant would be required to risk his or her life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.
The RPD's finding in this respect falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[17]
Further, as noted above, the RPD assessed state protection in terms of safety on most main roads in the country, the level of police presence in most communities, and general urban security: "[t]he military has re-established security along most main roads in the country and increased the presence of police in most municipalities" and "[t] he Canadian embassy's political councillor notes that urban security has improved dramatically in the last eight years." True as these findings may be, they are almost entirely irrelevant to the issue before the RPD which is the operational adequacy of state protection for a person specifically targeted by ELN and FARC. This aspect of the RPD's decision falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[18]
I wish to address one additional matter. The parties agree and the law is clear that a proper state protection analysis must be individualized. In a situation such as that faced by these Applicants, this Court has on many occasions held that the RPD must conduct an analysis of state protection particularized for persons specifically targeted by groups such as the ELN and FARC. I discussed this in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  following comments from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> apply equally to the case at bar:
Instead of conducting an individualized analysis of state protection in the applicant's case - a case of an individual who has been specifically targeted by FARC - by clearly articulating what it is the applicant needs to be protected from and what avenues of protection are available to him, the RPD looked at state protection efforts generally and equated those efforts to adequate state protection at the operational level.
Furthermore, the applicant points to four very recent decisions of this Court directly applicable to the case at bar. While not binding on me, I am obliged to give them most serious consideration under the doctrine of
stare decisis
. These cases are substantially if not completely on all fours with the case at bar. All deal with persons from Columbia specifically targeted by FARC, whose claims for refugee protection were rejected by the RPD, and who succeeded on judicial review because the RPD failed to conduct an analysis of state protection particularized for persons specifically targeted by FARC:
1)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Vargas Bustos
], the RPD had also relied on country conditions documents before it concluded that there was decreasing corruption in Colombia's security forces and it had been combating the FARC. At paragraph 40, Justice O'Keefe held:
Although the Board understood the test, [it] erred by failing to address the main question: is state protection available for people who have been specifically targeted by FARC? Rather, the Board's review of the country conditions document was focused on corruption within the security forces and military victories against FARC and other guerillas. The applicants are not fleeing from front-line combat; they are fleeing from crime. FARC's reduced military capacity does not mean that the state can protect people
who have been specifically targeted by FARC
for harassment or extortion. The Board member was required to consider that issue and the reasons do not show that he did. I find that the decision is therefore unreasonable (see
Martinez Gonzalez
at paragraph 16; and
Avila Rodriguez
at paragraph 46). [Emphasis added]
2)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Zinn held:
In the decision under review, the Board examined state protection generally, but failed to do so with an eye to the specific circumstances facing these applicants, namely that
they were specifically targeted by the FARC
. In doing so, the Board committed a reviewable error [...]. For this reason, the decision must be set aside. [Emphasis added]
3)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the RPD had also refused a refugee claim on the basis that the claimant had failed to make sufficient efforts to obtain state protection in Colombia before seeking asylum in Canada. The RPD had also focused on Colombia's efforts against the FARC on a national level and completed a general overview of efforts made by the Colombian government to address corruption and crime. At paragraphs 17-18, Justice O'Reilly held:
[17] Finally, the Board reviewed the documentary evidence and reasonably found that the situation in Colombia is improving. However, it did not go on to consider whether those improvements would help someone in Ms Gutierrez Infante's circumstances. The fact that FARC's capabilities have generally been reduced does not necessarily mean that Ms Gutierrez Infante,
a person specifically targeted by FARC members
, was not at risk of serious harm.
[18] Again, the question to be answered is whether she would likely face a reasonable chance of persecution if she returned to Colombia. The Board did not address that question. Given the evidence, its conclusion on the issue of state protection was unreasonable. [Emphasis added]
4)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Rennie held:
[24] As the applicants did not seek state protection in Columbia, the question is whether state protection might reasonably be forthcoming, having regard to the
applicant's particular circumstances
. [Emphasis added]
[19]
The RPD decision was made November 21, 2013. The decisions of this Court referred to above were made after or contemporaneously with the decision by the RPD, which likely explains why these cases were neither put to nor followed by the RPD. Regardless, in my view, they state the law in this regard. Whether the law in this regard was stated before or after the RPD decision, the Applicants are still in the system and are entitled to have the benefit of these cases at the re-determination being ordered. The RPD must conduct its analysis of state protection particularized for persons specifically targeted by ELN and or FARC. Because that did not occur, the RPD decision again falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[20]
Neither party requested the certification of a question, and none arises.
VI.
Conclusions
[21]
The application for judicial review should be allowed, and no question is certified.
JUDGMENT
[22]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is granted, the decision of the RPD is set aside, the matter is remitted for re-determination in accordance with these reasons by a differently constituted panel of the RPD, no question is certified, and there is no order as to costs.
.........................
Adriana Lucia Sanchez Mestre, Alberto Enrique Ordonez  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par Adriana Lucia Sanchez Mestre, Alberto Enrique Ordonez Florez et Melissa Ordonez Sanchez (les demandeurs) en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27, et visant la décision du 21 novembre 2013 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a conclu oralement qu'ils n'avaient ni la qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni celle de personnes à protéger. Pour les motifs qui suivent, il est fait droit à la demande.
I.
Les faits
[2]
Adriana Lucia Sanchez Mestre est née le 5 octobre 1984, son époux, Alberto Enrique Ordonez Florez est né le 19 novembre 1978, et leur fille, Melissa Ordonez Sanchez est née le 9 mai 2010. Ils sont tous citoyens de la Colombie. À l'appui de leur demande d'asile, les demandeurs ont avancé les allégations suivantes, qui ont toutes été jugées véridiques et crédibles par la SPR:
1. Mme Sanchez, une omnipraticienne, a travaillé à l'ESE Cartagena de Indias comme médecin de famille du 16 février 2011 au 15 mars 2013. Le 9 novembre 2012, en raison d'une urgence, elle a soigné un patient blessé à la jambe gauche. L'homme en question, accompagné de deux individus, est revenu la voir les 12 et 16 novembre 2012 pour des suivis médicaux. Le 19 novembre suivant, l'un des accompagnateurs est revenu lui demander d'effectuer une visite à domicile du patient qui souffrait de douleurs. Une fois sur place, les deux hommes lui ont déclaré que le patient allait bien, qu'ils étaient membres de
Ejército de Liberación Nacional
(ELN) (l'Armée de libération nationale), et qu'ils avaient besoin qu'elle leur serve de médecin dans certains de leurs lieux de camp. Mme Sanchez a répondu que cela lui était impossible et s'en est allée.
2. Le 28 novembre 2012, Mme Sanchez a reçu une lettre anonyme la sommant de donner une réponse et l'avertissant que le temps pour le faire était presque écoulé. Elle a eu peur et a pris des vacances pour voir si les choses allaient se clamer. Elle a séjourné aux États-Unis avec sa fille, sa mère et son frère du 1er au 10 décembre 2012. Elle a repris le travail le 11 décembre 2012.
2. Le 9 janvier 2013, l'un des hommes s'est présenté au Centre de santé et a demandé à la voir. Elle l'a évité. Elle a ensuite aperçu ces hommes à différentes reprises dans la rue, mais ils ne l'ont pas abordé. L'aide-soignante a indiqué à Mme Sanchez que d'autres hommes viendraient chez elle et qu'ils avaient des liens d'amitié avec les policiers de la région. C'est la raison pour laquelle Mme Sanchez n'a pas signalé ces incidents à la police. Elle a commencé à recevoir des appels téléphoniques et des messages de numéros inconnus, il lui était demandé de les accompagner à défaut de quoi elle en subirait les conséquences. Les personnes à l'autre bout du fil lui ont précisé qu'elle ne devait pas s'adresser aux autorités ou les choses empireraient. Mme Sanchez a gardé son calme parce qu'elle ne savait pas à quel point la situation était grave, mais elle pensait alors que la situation était temporaire.
4. Le 29 janvier 2013, Mme Sanchez a reçu à son bureau un article relatant le meurtre de sa camarade de promotion de l'université. Elle craignait que le ELN ne lui ait envoyé l'article en question en guise d'avertissement.
5. Le 4 février 2013, Mme Sanchez a demandé une mutation par écrit, mais a été informée par la suite qu'aucun poste n'était disponible ailleurs. Elle a une fois de plus demandé une mutation les 13 et 22 février 2013, mais n'a pas obtenu de réponse.
6. Le 6 mars 2013, Mme Sanchez a reçu un appel téléphonique lui indiquant que son heure était venue, qu'ils savaient qu'elle était mariée, que sa famille et elle assumeraient les conséquences et qu'elle ne devait pas contacter les autorités. Elle a démissionné de son poste le 15 mars 2013 et son époux l'a soutenue. Les demandeurs sont allés à Medellín le 23 mars 2013 pour s'éloigner de la ville pendant une semaine. Mme Sanchez a reçu un autre appel téléphonique le 26 mars suivant, et la personne à l'autre bout du fil lui a dit que personne ne jouait avec eux, que sa vie était menacée et qu'il y aurait des conséquences. Les demandeurs sont retournés à Carthagène le 31 mars 2013 et ont envoyé leur fille chez la mère de Mme Sanchez, ne lui rendant visite que les fins de semaine.
7. Le 26 avril 2013, Mme Sanchez a reçu une lettre anonyme dont les auteurs affirmaient qu'ils savaient où elle était, qu'ils la trouveraient et qu'elle ferait mieux de ne rien signaler aux autorités. Les demandeurs se sont installés chez la belle-mère de Mme Sanchez pendant deux semaines.
8. Mme Sanchez a commencé à suivre une psychothérapie le 18 mai 2013, car la situation la bouleversait. Le 4 juin 2013, elle a reconnu l'un des hommes dans le centre commercial près de son domicile. Son époux et elle ont déménagé; cela s'est reproduit plusieurs fois et les appels téléphoniques de menaces ont continué. Mme Sanchez était désespérée et ne savait pas où aller. Le 26 juin 2013, elle est retournée chez sa belle-mère et a commencé à chercher un logement, mais a découvert qu'aucun endroit n'était sûr en Colombie, l'emprise de l'ELN se faisant sentir dans tout le pays et dans les grandes villes où elle pouvait travailler. Elle a effectué des recherches en ligne et communiquer avec son père au Canada. Les demandeurs ont alors décidé que le Canada était leur meilleure option. Le 6 août 2013, Mme Sanchez a quitté sa maison, elle n'a pris que ses effets personnels, et elle s'est installée chez sa mère, ne sortant de chez elle que pour aller à ses rendez-vous chez un psychologue.
9. Mme Sanchez a également déclaré qu'elle craignait les Forces armées révolutionnaires de Colombie (
Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia
) (FARC) parce qu'elles agissent en étroite collaboration avec le ELN.
[3]
Les demandeurs sont entrés au Canada à partir des États-Unis en faisant valoir une exception à l'Entente sur les tiers pays sûrs. Le père de Mme Sanchez vit au Canada.
[4]
Le 21 novembre 2013, la SPR a rejeté les demandes d'asile des demandeurs. Ces derniers ont déposé une demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire qui a été accueillie le 5 janvier 2015. Entre-temps, la Cour a prononcé le sursis à leur renvoi en Colombie le 14 mars 2014.
II.
La décision soumise au contrôle
[5]
La SPR a accepté le témoignage des demandeurs tel qu'il est rapporté ci-dessus comme étant véridique; elle a conclu que les demandeurs étaient crédibles. La SPR a également estimé que Mme Sanchez était exposée à un risque en tant que médecin parce qu'elle avait le profil d'une personne susceptible d'être la cible d'un recrutement forcé de la part de groupes de guérillas comme le ELN et les FARC. La SPR a aussi conclu que son époux avait le profil d'une personne à même d'être prise pour cible en raison de ses liens familiaux.
[6]
La SPR a noté que la présomption de protection de l'État s'appliquait à la Colombie et que les demandeurs étaient donc tenus de la renverser à l'aide d'une preuve claire et convaincante établissant que l'État ne voulait pas ou ne pouvait pas assurer une protection appropriée. Les demandeurs devaient démontrer qu'ils avaient pris toutes les mesures raisonnables dans les circonstances afin d'obtenir la protection de leur pays avant de solliciter la protection internationale, à moins qu'il ne fût objectivement déraisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'ils le fassent.
[7]
La SPR a relevé que les demandeurs avaient déclaré qu'ils ne s'étaient pas adressés à l'État pour obtenir sa protection parce qu'ils avaient peur, et a précisé que l'on ne saurait réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État en invoquant qu'une réticence subjective à s'adresser aux autorités.
[8]
La SPR a reconnu qu'il y avait des problèmes en Colombie, mais a décidé que le pays faisait de réels efforts pour y faire face et que ces efforts avaient porté des fruits. Plus précisément, la SPR a relevé dans la preuve documentaire que [traduction] « [l] 'armée a rétabli la sécurité le long de la plupart des routes principales du pays et a accru la présence policière dans la plupart des municipalités », et que [traduction] « [l] e conseiller politique de l'ambassade du Canada souligne que la sécurité dans les villes s'est considérablement améliorée au cours des huit dernières années. »
[9]
Après avoir examiné l'ensemble de la preuve dont elle était saisie, la SPR a ensuite conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas réussi à réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État à l'aide d'éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants. La SPR n'était pas convaincue que la Colombie n'offrirait pas de protection de l'État raisonnable, si les demandeurs la sollicitaient, et elle a rejeté par conséquent leurs demandes.
III.
La question en litige
[10]
La présente affaire soulève la question de savoir si la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant que les demandeurs n'avaient pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État.
IV.
La norme de contrôle
[11]
Aux paragraphes 57 et 62 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), la Cour suprême du Canada a décidé qu'il n'était pas toujours nécessaire de se livrer à une analyse exhaustive pour arrêter la bonne norme de contrôle si « la jurisprudence établit déjà de manière satisfaisante le degré de déférence correspondant à une catégorie de questions en particulier. » Il est bien établi que la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique aux conclusions relatives à la protection de l'État puisqu'il s'agit de questions de fait et de droit qui, compte tenu de l'expertise de la SPR en la matière, commandent la retenue:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Au paragraphe 47 de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a expliqué comment doivent procéder les tribunaux de révision qui appliquent la norme de la décision raisonnable:
La cour de révision se demande dès lors si la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité. Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
V.
Observations des parties et analyse
[12]
Les demandeurs font remarquer que la SPR ne s'est fondée que sur un seul document, une réponse à une
Demande d'information de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié
de 2011, à l'appui de sa conclusion selon laquelle la protection de l'État en Colombie leur était offerte. Les demandeurs soutiennent que la SPR disposait d'une pléthore de documents établissant que la protection de l'État est inadéquate dans en Colombie, et il citent à cet égard un document de 2009 intitulé
Country Conditions in Colombia Relating to Asylum Claims in Canada
(Situation en Colombie intéressant les demandes d'asile présentées au Canada) rédigé par M. Marc Chernick, que la SPR a déjà reconnu comme un expert, un rapport spécial de 2010 intitulé « Continued Insecurity: Documenting the Permanence of the FARC-EP within the Context of Colombia's Civil War » (Insécurité persistante: Comptes rendus sur la permanence des FARC-EP dans le contexte de la guerre civile en Colombie) rédigé par James J. Brittain, le
Rapport de 2010 du Haut-commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l'homme sur la situation des droits de l'homme en Colombie
, et le rapport de 2011 du Conseil canadien pour les réfugiés.
[13]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que la SPR a commis quatre erreurs: 1) elle n'a pas tenu compte des éléments de preuve essentiels susmentionnés, qui contredisaient ses conclusions; 2) elle s'est fondée sur le fait que les demandeurs ne se sont pas réclamé de la protection de l'État en Colombie; 3) elle n'a pas expliqué pourquoi elle avait préféré un document particulier aux autres; 4) le document sur lequel la SPR s'est fondée a été lu de manière sélective.
[14]
La Cour reconnaît la présomption selon laquelle les tribunaux sont présumés avoir examiné l'ensemble dossier dont ils disposaient (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Bien que la Cour reconnaisse aussi que la SPR n'est pas tenue de mentionner chaque élément de preuve qui lui est soumis (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), ses motifs en l'espèce comportent de graves lacunes.

Comme la protection de l'État était la seule question en litige dans la présente affaire, et que la SPR avait rejeté les demandes d'asile des demandeurs principalement parce qu'ils auraient pu se prévaloir d'une protection de l'État s'ils s'étaient adressés aux autorités, la SPR aurait dû au moins fournir des explications concernant la preuve qui contredisait directement cette conclusion. La Cour relève que la preuve contradictoire soumise par les demandeurs, qu'ils ont tous les deux évoquée en partie à l'audience et précisément demandé à la SPR d'examiner, non seulement corroborait leur témoignage selon lequel ils étaient exposés au risque, mais justifiait aussi leur décision de ne pas se réclamer de la protection de l'État par crainte de la corruption des autorités. La Cour souscrit à l'avis des demandeurs qu'il s'agit ici d'un cas où « une déclaration générale affirmant que l'organisme a examiné l'ensemble de la preuve ne suffit pas lorsque les éléments de preuve dont il n'a pas discuté dans ses motifs semblent carrément contredire sa conclusion » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 17 (CF)) et où « [si le décideur] ne signale [pas] une preuve contradictoire pertinente qui lui est présentée, la cour de révision peut conclure que la Commission n'a pas pris en compte ou qu'elle a apprécié de manière erronée des faits fondamentaux et est parvenue à une décision erronée » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Pour ce motif, et conformément à la jurisprudence, la Cour conclut que cet aspect de la décision de la SPR n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[16]
Étant donné la conclusion relative à la crédibilité et à la preuve qui confirme qu'il aurait été inutile de demander la protection de l'État, la Cour souscrit aussi à l'avis des demandeurs selon lequel il n'était pas nécessaire de se réclamer de cette protection dans l'unique but de prouver cet élément. Le droit applicable est énoncé de manière claire par la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt phare
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 724, dans lequel le juge La Forest déclarait au nom d'une Cour unanime:
En outre, le fait que le demandeur doive mettre sa vie en danger en sollicitant la protection inefficace d'un État, simplement pour démontrer cette inefficacité, semblerait aller à l'encontre de l'objet de la protection internationale.
La conclusion de la SPR sur ce point n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[17]
Par ailleurs, comme il est souligné ci-dessus, la SPR a examiné la protection de l'État quant à la sécurité sur la plupart des routes du pays, au degré de présence policière dans la plupart des collectivités et à la sécurité générale dans les villes: [traduction] « [l] 'armée a rétabli la sécurité le long de la plupart des routes principales du pays et a accru la présence policière dans la plupart des municipalités » et [traduction] « [l]e conseiller politique de l'ambassade du Canada souligne que la sécurité dans les villes s'est considérablement améliorée au cours des huit dernières années. » Aussi fondées que ces conclusions puissent être, elles sont presque entièrement dépourvues de pertinence quant à la question dont la SPR était saisie, à savoir celle de l'efficacité opérationnelle de la protection de l'État pour une personne précisément prise pour cible par le ELN et les FARC. Cet aspect de la décision de la SPR n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[18]
La Cour souhaite traiter une autre question. Les parties sont d'accord et le droit est clair qu'une analyse adéquate de la protection de l'État doit être individualisée. Dans une situation comme celle qui concerne les présents demandeurs, la Cour a plusieurs fois décidé que l'analyse de la SPR relative à la protection de l'État doit se rapporter personnellement à ceux qui sont spécifiquement visés par des groupes comme l'ELN et les FARC. J'ai débattu de cette question dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  commentaires suivants qui en sont extraits s'appliquent également au cas qui nous occupe:
[traduction]
Plutôt que d'effectuer une analyse individualisée de la protection de l'État relativement au demandeur - le cas d'une personne ayant précisément été prise pour cible par les FARC - en formulant clairement contre quoi le demandeur doit être protégé et quels recours s'offrent à lui à cet égard, la SPR a examiné les efforts généraux de protection de l'État et a assimilés ceux-ci à une protection adéquate sur le plan opérationnel.
En outre, le demandeur invoque quatre décisions très récentes de la Cour qui s'appliquent directement au cas qui nous occupe. Bien qu'elles ne soient pas contraignantes pour moi, je suis tenu de leur accorder la plus grande attention en raison du principe du
stare decisis
. Ces décisions concordent de façon importante si ce n'est entièrement avec l'affaire dont nous sommes saisis. Elles concernent toutes des personnes originaires de Colombie ayant précisément été prises pour cible par les FARC, dont les demandes d'asile ont été rejetées par la SPR, et qui ont eu gain de cause à l'étape du contrôle judiciaire, parce que la SPR n'a pas mené une analyse de la protection de l'État particularise et pour les personnes précisément prises pour cible par les FARC:
1) Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Vargas Bustos
), la SPR s'était aussi appuyée sur des documents concernant la situation dans le pays pour conclure que les forces de sécurité en Colombie étaient moins corrompues et qu'elles combattaient les FARC. Au paragraphe 40, le juge O'Keefe déclarait:
Bien que la Commission ait compris le critère applicable, je souscris ultimement à la prétention des demandeurs selon laquelle la Commission a commis une erreur en ne se penchant pas sur la question principale: les personnes ayant spécifiquement été prises pour cibles par les FARC peuvent-elles se réclamer de la protection de l'État? La Commission a plutôt concentré son examen de la preuve documentaire sur la situation dans le pays, sur la corruption au sein des forces de sécurité et sur les réussites militaires contre les FARC et contre les autres guérilléros. Les demandeurs ne s'étaient pas sauvés des premières lignes du combat; ils fuyaient le crime. La réduction des capacités militaires des FARC ne signifie pas que l'État peut protéger les
gens ayant été spécifiquement pris pour cibles par les FARC
à des fins de harcèlement ou d'extorsion. Le commissaire devait se pencher sur cette question et les motifs ne démontrent pas qu'il l'ait fait. Par conséquent, je conclus que la décision est déraisonnable (voir
Martinez Gonzalez
, au paragraphe 16, et
Avila Rodriguez
au paragraphe 46). [Non souligné dans l'original.]
2) Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Zinn a déclaré:
Dans la décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle, la Commission s'est penchée sur la protection de l'État de façon générale, mais elle n'a pas examiné les circonstances propres aux demandeurs, c'est-à-dire le fait que
ces derniers avaient été ciblés directement par les FARC
. Ce faisant, la Commission a commis une erreur susceptible de révision [...]. Pour cette raison, la décision doit être infirmée. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
3) Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la SPR avait également rejeté une demande d'asile au motif que le demandeur n'avait pas fait suffisamment d'efforts pour obtenir la protection de l'État en Colombie avant de demander l'asile au Canada. La SPR s'était attardée encore une fois sur les efforts de la Colombie pour contrer les FARC à l'échelle nationale, et a examiné de manière générale les mesures prises par le gouvernement de la Colombie pour lutter contre la corruption et le crime. Aux paragraphes 17 et 18, le juge O'Reilly a déclaré:
[17] En dernier lieu, la Commission a examiné la preuve documentaire et elle a raisonnablement conclu que la situation en Colombie va en s'améliorant. Cependant, elle ne s'était pas penchée sur la question de savoir si ces améliorations auraient pour effet d'aider une personne dans la situation de Mme Gutierrez Infante. Le fait que les capacités des FARC ont été globalement réduites ne signifie pas nécessairement que Mme Gutierrez Infante,
une personne spécifiquement prise pour cible par les membres des FARC
, n'était pas exposée au risque de subir un préjudice grave.
[18] Une fois de plus, la question à laquelle il fallait répondre était celle de savoir si la demanderesse serait vraisemblablement exposée à une possibilité raisonnable d'être persécutée si elle retournait en Colombie. La Commission n'a pas répondu à cette question. Compte tenu de la preuve, sa conclusion quant à la question de la protection de l'État était déraisonnable. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
4) Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Rennie a déclaré:
[24] Puisque les demandeurs n'ont pas sollicité la protection de l'État en Colombie, il s'agit de savoir si la protection de l'État peut raisonnablement être assurée,
eu égard à leur situation particulière
. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[19]
La décision de la SPR a été rendue le 21 novembre 2013. Les décisions précitées de la Cour lui sont contemporaines ou ultérieures, ce qui explique vraisemblablement pourquoi elles n'ont pas été soumises à la SPR et pourquoi elle ne les a pas suivies. Quoi qu'il en soit, de l'avis de la Cour, elles énoncent le droit applicable. Que le droit à cet égard soit énoncé avant ou après la décision de la SPR, les demandeurs continuent d'être dans le système et ont le droit d'en tirer profit lors du réexamen qui sera décidé. L'analyse de la SPR relative à la protection de l'État doit se rapporter personnellement à ceux qui sont précisément pris pour cible par le ELN ou les FARC. Étant donné que ce ne fut pas le cas, la décision de la SPR n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
