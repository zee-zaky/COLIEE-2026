Summary:

[1]
O'Keefe, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board), dated February 28, 2012, wherein the applicant was determined to be neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection as defined in subsection 97(1) of the Act.
[2]
The applicant requests that the Board's decision be set aside and the application be referred back to the Board for redetermination by a different panel.
Background
[3]
The applicant was born in Guyana in 1958. She married her husband in 1980. The marriage began well and the couple had two children. Eventually, however, her husband joined a criminal gang and began drinking heavily.
[4]
The applicant's husband became physically violent, punching and kicking her and using weapons. He beat her in front of their children. She became a slave in her own house. Once her children left home, she was left alone with her alcoholic abuser.
[5]
The applicant repeatedly reported the abuse to the Guyanese police, but they only warned the husband and refused to get involved in domestic matters. The abuse continued, including strangling and death threats. Her husband was kicked out of the gang and this led to more drinking and bitterness.
[6]
As the abuse increased, the applicant decided to file for divorce. Once her husband learned of this plan, he continued to threaten her and he said he kept a loaded gun in order to murder her.
[7]
The applicant went into hiding. In June 2007, she was granted a visitor's visa for Canada in order to attend her niece's wedding.
[8]
The applicant arrived in Canada on June 28, 2007 and claimed protection on September 9, 2011. She fears if she returns to Guyana, her ex-husband will kill her.
Board's Decision
[9]
The Board made its decision on February 28, 2012. After summarizing the basis of the applicant's fear and accepting her identity, the Board turned to the issue of state protection.
[10]
The Board stated that Guyana was presumed capable of protecting its citizens and it was up to the applicant to rebut that presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the Guyanese authorities would not be forthcoming with serious efforts to protect her.
[11]
The Board found that the applicant had not rebutted the presumption. In considering the country conditions documents, the Board found that they were mixed and inconclusive, since some of the text indicated Guyana's domestic violence protection mechanisms were inadequate, while other parts indicated reasonably functional protection was available for women fearing domestic violence.
[12]
The Board excerpted the full text of a 2008 response to information request on domestic violence in Guyana (the RIR), as well as the relevant portion of the 2008 United States Department of State human rights report (the DOS report).
[13]
The Board also noted that the state had made efforts to protect the applicant on five occasions, although they were inadequate. The Board indicated it had accepted all the documentary evidence, which pointed to a mixed picture. The Board also noted that the applicant had not made any effort to seek protection in the past several years and that local police failures in themselves do not amount to a general lack of state protection.
[14]
The Board stated that home states are not required to provide effective or guaranteed protection, but only need to make serious efforts at protection. Therefore, the Board found that the applicant had not established a clear and convincing case that the state would not be reasonably forthcoming with such efforts. The Board rejected the applicant's claim.
Issues
[15]
The applicant submits the following points at issue:
1. Was the decision made pursuant to legislation inconsistent with section 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
?
2. Did the Board apply the wrong test for Convention refugee status?
3. Did the Board violate the principles of natural justice?
4. Did the Board fail to consider all of the evidence?
[16]
I would rephrase the issues as follows:
1. What is the appropriate standard of review?
2. Did the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?
Applicant's Written Submissions
[17]
The applicant argues that sworn testimony is presumed to be true and that her testimony has not been impugned in any way. The documentary evidence indicates there is a well-founded fear of persecution given the backdrop of country conditions in Guyana. The applicant argues she was not given police protection.
[18]
The applicant argues the Board overlooked evidence showing the lack of police protection. Any evidence that indicates it is safe for a woman to be in Guyana when a gang member has threatened to kill her is due to media bias. It was unfair for the Board to focus on documents showing Guyana is safe as opposed to the documents of the applicant. The Board also ignored letters from the applicant's daughter indicating that Guyana was unsafe for her.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[19]
The respondent argues that the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness.
[20]
The respondent argues that it is an accepted principle that the test is not absolute state protection and that even the most effective, well-resourced and highly motivated police forces will have difficulty providing effective protection. The test is whether state protection is adequate. It was up to the Board to weigh the evidence and determine whether there was sufficient clear and convincing evidence that state protection was unavailable.
[21]
The respondent argues the Board considered both the negative and positive evidence. The respondent characterizes the applicant's arguments as only pertaining to the weighing of evidence.
Analysis and Decision
Issue 1
What is the appropriate standard of review?
[22]
Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).
[23]
Assessments of the adequacy of state protection raise questions of mixed fact and law and is also reviewable against a standard of reasonableness (see
Hinzman, Re
, 2007 FCA 171, [2007] FCJ No 584 at paragraph 38).
[24]
In reviewing the Board's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 59). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraph 59).
Issue 2
Did the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?
[25]
The respondent's position in this proceeding is that the proper test for state protection is whether such protection was adequate.
[26]
The Board's decision, however, frequently invokes the "serious efforts" of a state to provide protection. This concept is invoked at least ten times in its decision, including in its stating of the test for refugee status:
According to refugee protection law, home states only need to provide adequate protection and do not have to provide perfect protection: in other words, home states only need to make serious efforts at protection and do not have to provide
de facto
effective or
de facto
guaranteed protection.
[27]
The use of the phrase "in other words" in the passage is incorrect: "adequate protection" and "serious efforts at protection" are not the same thing. The former is concerned with whether the actual outcome of protection exists in a given country, while the latter merely indicates whether the state has taken steps to provide that protection.
[28]
It is of little comfort to a person fearing persecution that a state has made an effort to provide protection if that effort has little effect. For that reason, the Board is tasked with evaluating the empirical reality of the adequacy of state protection.
[29]
This Court has affirmed this interpretation of state protection repeatedly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FC No 1589, Mr. Justice Roger Hughes made this clear (at paragraph 8):
Another error of law is with respect to what is the nature of state protection that is to be considered. Here the Member found that Mexico "is making serious and genuine efforts" to address the problem. That is not the test. What must be considered is the actual effectiveness of the protection.
[30]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 153, Mr. Justice Michel Beaudry indicated the same principle (at paragraph 10):
First of all, it weighed the evidence of criticisms of the effectiveness of the legislation against evidence on the efforts made to address the problems of domestic violence. This is not enough to ground a finding of state protection; regard must be given to what is actually happening and not what the state is endeavoring to put in place (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 215 at paragraph 14).
[31]
Most recently, Madam Justice Catherine Kane confirmed the same principle in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
The test is not 'perfect' state protection, but adequate state protection. Still, mere willingness to protect is insufficient; state protection must be effective to a certain degree:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 243 at para. 47.
[32]
On this point, therefore, the Board clearly misstated the law. I will still, however, consider whether the Board's consideration of the evidence would have reasonably led to a finding of adequate protection had the Board properly stated the test.
[33]
The Board repeatedly described the country conditions documents as "mixed" in their conclusions on state protection, since "some of the text in the most recent documents indicates that Guyana's domestic violence state protection mechanisms are inadequate" but "other text in the same recent documents tells a different story and indicates Guyana has reasonably functional state protection mechanisms".
[34]
With all due deference to the Board in its consideration of evidence, I believe that the Board's error in stating the proper legal test for state protection is also reflected in its finding that the evidence is "mixed". That is, the country conditions evidence is really a mix of (1) clear statements that state protection is inadequate and (2) descriptions of various efforts made by the Guyanese state.
[35]
For example, the RIR includes these statements:
- domestic violence in Guyana is widespread;
- at least one out of every three women in Guyana has reportedly been a victim of domestic violence; and
- some victims are still unaware of their rights and may be too afraid to file a report; when victims do file a complaint, police sometimes offer little support.
[36]
It also includes these "serious efforts":
- there are NGOs providing services to victims of domestic violence;
- there is legislation prohibiting domestic violence;
- the police receive training on protecting victims; and
- the government launched a national policy on domestic violence.
[37]
The DOS report included these statements:
- rape is a problem and pervasive in Guyanese society;
- ineffective police and prosecutors resulted in few charges and fewer convictions;
- domestic violence and violence against women, including spousal abuse, is widespread and crossed racial and socioeconomic lines;
- anti-rape legislation was frequently not enforced because of a lack of willingness of victims to press charges.
[38]
It also included these "serious efforts":
- spousal rape has been criminalized by a new law;
- domestic violence is illegal and subject to criminal and civil penalties;
- the national police force has established domestic violence units;
- there is a shelter for victims of domestic violence; and
- sexual harassment is illegal.
[39]
When state protection analysis is properly applied, it is clear that the "serious efforts" listed above are not proper evidence of the adequacy of state protection. A law on the books or a training session for police may not lead to the outcome of adequate protection. Evidence of adequacy is that which indicates whether or not a given law actually functions to protect citizens or whether police training has resulted in a real difference in police behaviour.
[40]
The Board justified its decision on the basis that the evidence on state protection was mixed, but at no point in its decision did the Board identify any document or statement indicating that the evidence on the adequacy of state protection was mixed. Rather, the Board saw the mixed result being due to evidence of inadequate state protection being counter-balanced by evidence of serious efforts. As I have described above, the latter category of evidence does not speak to the proper test for state protection. Therefore, even with the best attempt to supplement the Board's reasons, I cannot find them reasonable.
[41]
It is also puzzling why the Board referred multiple times to the applicant's failure to seek protection "in the past several years", given that the applicant has been in Canada since July 2007.
[42]
It is not this Court's role to reweigh evidence and my comments should not be taken as speaking to the weight of any particular piece of evidence. Rather, the issue here is that the Board misunderstood the proper test for state protection and its evidentiary findings were sufficiently tainted by that misunderstanding that I cannot disentangle them.
[43]
This decision is unreasonable because it conflicts with the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, value of justification, as its state protection finding is neither reasonably justified by reference to the proper legal test nor by reference to properly considered evidence.
[44]
In my view, on the facts of this case, the applicant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.
[45]
I would therefore grant the application for judicial review and return the matter to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.
[46]
Neither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.
JUDGMENT
[47]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the Board is set aside and the matter is referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie, sous le régime du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision en date du 28 février 2012 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés à la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) a refusé de reconnaître à la demanderesse la qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention au titre de l'article 96 de la Loi, ainsi que celle de personne à protéger au titre de son paragraphe 97(1).
[2]
La demanderesse sollicite l'annulation de la décision de la Commission et le renvoi de sa demande d'asile devant cette dernière pour nouvel examen par un tribunal différemment constitué.
Le contexte
[3]
La demanderesse est née au Guyana en 1958 et s'est mariée en 1980. Au début, elle s'entendait bien avec son mari, avec qui elle a eu deux enfants. Mais il est plus tard entré dans un gang et a commencé à consommer une grande quantité d'alcool.
[4]
Le mari de la demanderesse a fini par devenir violent, lui donnant coups de poing et coups de pied et l'agressant avec des armes. Il la battait devant leurs enfants. Elle est ainsi devenue une esclave dans sa propre maison. Une fois que ses enfants eurent quitté le foyer, elle est restée seule avec son mari alcoolique et violent.
[5]
La demanderesse s'est plainte à de multiples reprises des violences dont elle faisait l'objet à la police guyanienne, qui s'est contentée de donner des avertissements au mari, refusant de se mêler de querelles conjugales. La violence a continué, y compris sous forme de strangulation et de menaces de mort. L'alcoolisme et l'agressivité du mari n'ont fait que croître après que son gang l'eut exclu.
[6]
Devant l'aggravation des mauvais traitements qu'elle subissait, la demanderesse a décidé de demander le divorce. Quand son mari eut appris son projet, il l'a menacée de plus belle, l'informant qu'il gardait une arme à feu chargée pour la tuer.
[7]
La demanderesse est alors partie se cacher. En juin 2007, elle a obtenu un visa de visiteur pour le Canada afin d'y assister au mariage d'une nièce.
[8]
Elle est arrivée au Canada le 28 juin 2007 et y a demandé l'asile le 9 septembre 2011. Elle craint que son ex-mari ne la tue si elle retourne au Guyana.
La décision de la Commission
[9]
La Commission a rendu sa décision le 28 février 2012. Après avoir récapitulé les motifs de crainte de la demanderesse et avoir reconnu son identité, la Commission a examiné la question de la protection de l'État.
[10]
La Commission a d'abord rappelé que le Guyana était présumé capable de protéger ses citoyens et qu'il incombait à la demanderesse de réfuter cette présomption au moyen d'éléments prouvant de manière claire et convaincante que les autorités guyaniennes ne feraient pas d'efforts sérieux pour la protéger.
[11]
La Commission a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas réfuté cette présomption. Elle a estimé que les documents sur la situation au Guyana brossaient un tableau contradictoire et peu concluant, certains passages déclarant insuffisants les mécanismes de protection contre la violence familiale, tandis que selon d'autres, les Guyaniennes en butte à ce type de violence jouissaient d'une protection raisonnablement efficace.
[12]
La Commission a cité le texte intégral d'une réponse à une demande d'information, datée de 2008, sur la violence familiale au Guyana (la RDI), ainsi que le passage applicable du rapport de 2008 du Département d'État américain sur les droits de la personne (le rapport du DOS).
[13]
La Commission a aussi fait observer que l'État guyanien avait tenté à cinq occasions de protéger la demanderesse, mais les mesures prises étaient insuffisantes. Elle a déclaré accepter la totalité de la preuve documentaire, qui donnait une image contradictoire de la situation. Elle a aussi fait remarquer que la demanderesse n'avait fait aucun effort pour obtenir la protection de l'État au cours des dernières années et que les manquements de la police locale ne constituaient pas en soi une insuffisance générale de protection étatique.
[14]
La Commission a posé en principe qu'il n'est pas demandé à l'État d'origine de fournir une protection efficace ou garantie, mais seulement de faire de sérieux efforts de protection. Par conséquent, a-t-elle conclu, la demanderesse n'avait pas prouvé de manière claire et convaincante que l'État ne déploierait pas de tels efforts dans une mesure raisonnable, de sorte qu'il fallait rejeter sa demande d'asile.
Les questions en litige
[15]
La demanderesse met en litige les questions suivantes:
1. La décision contrôlée a-t-elle été rendue sous le régime de dispositions légales incompatibles avec l'article 7 de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés?
2. La Commission a-t-elle appliqué un critère erroné à la détermination de la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention?
3. La Commission a-t-elle enfreint les principes de justice naturelle?
4. La Commission a-t-elle omis de prendre en considération la totalité de la preuve?
[16]
Je reformulerais comme suit les questions en litige:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
2. La Commission s'est-elle trompée en rejetant la demande d'asile de la demanderesse?
Les conclusions écrites de la demanderesse
[17]
La demanderesse fait valoir que les témoignages sous serment sont présumés véridiques et que le sien n'a été aucunement contesté. De plus, la preuve documentaire montre qu'elle craint avec raison d'être persécutée, étant donné les conditions qui règnent au Guyana. La demanderesse soutient que la police ne l'a pas protégée.
[18]
Selon la demanderesse, la Commission a passé sous silence les éléments tendant à établir l'absence de protection policière. Tout élément donnant à penser qu'une femme ne court aucun danger au Guyana lorsqu'un membre de gang l'a menacée de mort doit être mis au compte d'un parti pris des médias. La Commission a manqué d'équité en se concentrant sur les documents d'après lesquels le Guyana est un pays sûr au détriment de ceux qu'a produits la demanderesse. Toujours suivant cette dernière, la Commission a en outre omis de prendre en considération des lettres de sa fille montrant qu'elle n'était pas en sécurité au Guyana.
Les conclusions écrites du défendeur
[19]
Le défendeur soutient que la norme de contrôle applicable est celle du caractère raisonnable.
[20]
Il est de droit constant, fait valoir le défendeur, que le critère n'est pas l'existence d'une protection absolue de l'État, et l'on s'accorde à reconnaître que même les forces policières les plus efficaces, les plus riches en ressources et les plus motivées auront du mal à offrir une protection effective. Le critère consiste à se demander si la protection de l'État est adéquate. Il appartenait à la Commission d'apprécier la preuve et d'établir si elle contenait suffisamment d'éléments démontrant de manière claire et convaincante que la demanderesse ne disposait pas de la protection de l'État.
[21]
Le défendeur fait valoir que la Commission a pris en considération les éléments de preuve aussi bien favorables que défavorables à la demanderesse. Selon lui, les arguments de cette dernière ne se rapportent qu'à l'appréciation de la preuve.
Analyse et décision
Première question en litige
Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
[22]
Lorsque la jurisprudence a déterminé la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière portée devant la cour de révision, celle-ci peut l'adopter sans autre examen (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 57).
[23]
L'examen de la question de savoir si la protection de l'État est adéquate soulève des questions mixtes de fait et de droit et relève aussi de la norme de contrôle fondée sur le caractère raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 584, paragraphe 38).
[24]
La Cour, lorsqu'elle contrôle une décision de la Commission selon la norme du caractère raisonnable, ne doit intervenir que si celle-ci a prononcé, à la suite d'un processus manquant de transparence et d'intelligibilité, une conclusion injustifiée qui n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables au regard de la preuve dont elle disposait (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, paragraphe 47;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 59). Comme la Cour suprême du Canada l'a affirmé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la cour de révision ne peut substituer à la solution retenue celle qui serait à son avis préférable, pas plus qu'il ne lui appartient d'apprécier à nouveau la preuve (paragraphe 59).
Deuxième question en litige
La Commission s'est-elle trompée en rejetant la demande d'asile de la demanderesse?
[25]
Le défendeur fait valoir dans la présente instance que le critère applicable à la protection de l'État consiste à se demander si cette protection est adéquate.
[26]
Cependant, la Commission parle souvent dans sa décision des « sérieux efforts » fournis ou à fournir par les États pour protéger leurs citoyens. Elle y invoque cette notion au moins dix fois, y compris dans sa formulation du critère applicable à la détermination de la qualité de réfugié:
Selon le droit en matière d'octroi de l'asile, l'État d'origine doit seulement offrir une protection adéquate; il n'a pas à assurer une protection parfaite. En d'autres termes, il doit seulement faire de sérieux efforts pour protéger ses citoyens et n'a pas à assurer une protection effective ou garantie dans les faits.
[27]
La Commission a tort de dire « [e]n d'autres termes » dans ce passage: la « protection adéquate » et les « sérieux efforts pour protéger [les] citoyens » sont deux choses différentes. L'une concerne la question de savoir si la protection est effectivement assurée dans un pays donné, tandis que les autres ne nous renseignent que sur celle de savoir si l'État a pris des mesures afin de garantir cette protection.
[28]
C'est une maigre consolation pour la personne qui craint d'être persécutée que son État ait fait des efforts pour la protéger si ceux-ci ne sont pas ou guère suivis d'effet. C'est pourquoi la Commission doit évaluer dans sa réalité empirique le caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État.
[29]
Notre Cour a avalisé à maintes reprises cette interprétation du critère de la protection de l'État. Monsieur le juge Roger Hughes, par exemple, s'est exprimé sans ambiguïté à ce propos au paragraphe 8 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1589:
Une autre erreur de droit a trait à la nature de la protection de l'État qui doit être prise en compte. En l'espèce, le commissaire a conclu que le Mexique « fait de sérieux efforts » pour résoudre le problème. Ce n'est pas là le critère. Ce qui doit être pris en compte est l'efficacité réelle de la protection.
[30]
Monsieur le juge Michel Beaudry a formulé le même principe au paragraphe 10 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 153:
D'abord, [la Commission] a apprécié la preuve concernant les critiques de l'efficacité de la loi au regard de la preuve concernant les mesures prises pour traiter les problèmes de violence conjugale. Cela ne suffit pas à justifier une conclusion d'existence de la protection de l'État; on doit tenir compte de la situation réelle et non de ce que l'État se propose de faire ou a entrepris de mettre en place (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 215, au paragraphe 14).
[31]
Enfin, Madame la juge Catherine Kane a réitéré ce principe au paragraphe 44 de la toute récente décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Le critère n'est pas une protection de l'État « parfaite », mais adéquate. Là encore, la simple volonté de protéger ne suffit pas; la protection de l'État doit présenter un certain niveau d'efficacité:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 243, au paragraphe 47.
[32]
Donc, la Commission a de toute évidence mal défini le critère juridique applicable. J'examinerai néanmoins si son examen de la preuve l'aurait raisonnablement amenée à conclure au caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État dans l'hypothèse où elle aurait donné une définition juste du critère y afférent.
[33]
La Commission qualifie à plusieurs reprises de « contradictoires » les conclusions sur la protection de l'État formulées dans les documents relatifs à la situation guyanienne, puisque « [d]ans certaines parties des documents les plus récents, il est indiqué que les mécanismes de protection en matière de violence conjugale au Guyana sont inadéquats », alors que « d'autres parties des mêmes documents montrent une situation différente, où le pays est doté de mécanismes de protection raisonnablement fonctionnels ».
[34]
Même en exerçant toute la retenue que commandent les résultats de l'examen de la preuve par la Commission, j'estime que son erreur dans l'énonciation du critère juridique applicable à la protection de l'État se retrouve dans sa conclusion selon laquelle la preuve est « contradictoire ». En fait, la preuve concernant la situation au Guyana se compose de deux catégories d'éléments: 1) des passages déclarant sans ambiguïté que la protection de l'État est inadéquate, et 2) la description de divers efforts déployés par l'État guyanien.
[35]
Par exemple, la RDI comprend les affirmations suivantes:
- la violence familiale est très répandue au Guyana;
- au moins une femme sur trois y en aurait été victime;
- certaines victimes sont encore ignorantes de leurs droits et pourraient avoir trop peur pour porter plainte; et la police n'offre parfois que peu de secours à celles qui portent plainte malgré tout.
[36]
La RDI énumère également les « sérieux efforts » suivants:
- il y a des ONG qui offrent des services aux victimes de violence familiale;
- il existe des dispositions légales interdisant ce type de violence;
- les policiers reçoivent une formation concernant la protection des victimes;
- le gouvernement a institué une politique nationale de lutte contre la violence familiale.
[37]
Le rapport du DOS comprend quant à lui les affirmations qui suivent:
- le viol est un mal très répandu dans la société guyanienne;
- l'inefficacité de la police et du ministère public se traduit par la rareté des inculpations et celle, plus grande encore, des déclarations de culpabilité;
- la violence familiale et la violence contre les femmes, notamment la violence conjugale, sont générales et ne font pas acception des races ni des catégories socioéconomiques;
- la législation contre le viol reste souvent lettre morte en raison du peu d'empressement des victimes à engager des poursuites.
[38]
Ce rapport fait aussi état de « sérieux efforts »:
- une nouvelle loi criminalise le viol conjugal;
- la violence familiale est illégale, et ses auteurs encourent des sanctions pénales et civiles;
- la police nationale a créé des unités d'intervention contre la violence familiale;
- il existe un refuge pour les victimes de ce genre de violence;
- le harcèlement sexuel est aussi illégal.
[39]
Il est évident, si on analyse la protection de l'État suivant le critère voulu, que les « sérieux efforts » énumérés plus haut ne suffisent pas établir le caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État. Une loi inscrite au code ou un cours de formation pour les policiers n'ont pas nécessairement pour effet la garantie d'une protection adéquate. Les éléments de preuve qui concernent vraiment le caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État sont ceux qui permettent de répondre aux questions de savoir si une loi donnée est effectivement appliquée de manière à protéger les citoyens ou si la formation reçue par les policiers a entraîné un changement réel de leur comportement.
[40]
La Commission justifie sa décision en invoquant la nature contradictoire de la preuve relative à la protection de l'État, mais elle ne cite dans ses motifs aucun document ou passage de document qui révélerait des contradictions dans la preuve concernant le caractère adéquat de cette protection. La Commission attribue plutôt la nature contradictoire de la preuve au fait que les éléments de celle-ci tendant à établir la mise en œuvre d'efforts sérieux lui paraissent contrebalancer ceux qui tendent à établir le caractère inadéquat de la protection de l'État. Or, comme je l'expliquais plus haut, la première catégorie de ces éléments est dénuée de pertinence selon le critère qui doit être appliqué à l'évaluation de la protection offerte par l'État. Par conséquent, même en faisant de mon mieux pour suppléer les motifs de la Commission, je ne puis les déclarer raisonnables.
[41]
En outre, il paraît étrange que la Commission invoque à maintes reprises le fait que la demanderesse se soit abstenue de demander la protection de l'État « au cours des dernières années », alors qu'elle habite au Canada depuis juillet 2007.
[42]
Il n'appartient pas à notre Cour d'apprécier de nouveau la preuve, et le lecteur ne devrait interpréter aucune de mes observations comme portant sur le poids à attribuer à un élément de preuve déterminé, quel qu'il soit. J'essaie plutôt de montrer ici que la Commission a mal compris le critère applicable à l'évaluation de la protection de l'État et que ses conclusions relatives à la preuve sont viciées par cette erreur au point qu'il ne m'est pas possible de les considérer indépendamment d'elle.
[43]
La décision contrôlée est déraisonnable au motif qu'elle ne remplit pas l'exigence de justification formulée dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité; en effet, la conclusion de la Commission touchant la protection de l'État ne se justifie raisonnablement ni par l'application du critère juridique voulu ni par l'examen de la preuve sous l'angle nécessaire.
[44]
Étant donné les faits de l'espèce, la demanderesse me paraît avoir réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État.
[45]
En conséquence, je suis d'avis d'accueillir la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire et de renvoyer l'affaire devant la Commission pour nouvel examen par un tribunal différemment constitué.
[46]
Aucune des parties n'a proposé de question grave de portée générale à la certification.
