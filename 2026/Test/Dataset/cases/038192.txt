Cullen, J.
: On May 24, 1994, the plaintiff filed a statement of claim against the defendants alleging trademark infringement. On June 2, 1994, the plaintiff brought a motion seeking an interim injunction enjoining the defendants from using the plaintiff's registered trademark and trade name. On June 2, 1994, Strayer, J., adjourned the application for interim injunction on consent of the defendants until July 14, 1994. On June 27, 1994, this application was further adjourned by my colleague, McKeown, J., to July 26, 1994. On June 22, 1994, the defendants filed the present motion seeking to strike out the statement of claim and vary the order of Strayer, J., dated June 2, 1994.
Motion
[2]
The defendants bring a motion for:
1. Summary judgment dismissing all or part of the claim in the statement of claim.
2. In the alternative, an order striking out the statement of claim as it is an abuse of process of this court.
3. An order:
(i) varying the order of Mr. Justice Strayer dated June 2, 1994, so as to adjourn the hearing of a motion for an interlocutory injunction scheduled to be heard in Calgary July 14, 1994, until this Honourable Court issues a decision with respect to the relief requested in paragraphs 1 and 2 above; and
(ii) change the venue of the hearing of the motion for an interlocutory injunction to Toronto.
Grounds
[3]
1. The statement of claim alleges that the plaintiff is the registered owner of the Canadian Trademark Registration No. 418,748 (the "Trademark"), and the plaintiff thereby claims relief based upon ss. 19, 20, 22 and 7(b) of the
Trade-marks Act
. The plaintiff is not, however, the registered owner of said trademark. Rather, the registered owner of said trademark is MTC Bild und Tontrager GmbH. The plaintiff is a distributor of the registered owner's goods in Canada, as is the defendant, Cavis Marketing Inc.
[4]
2. There is no genuine issue for trial with respect to the statement of claim. Further, the statement of claim is an abuse of process of this Honourable Court.
[5]
3. It would be most efficient if the hearing of the motion for an interlocutory injunction is delayed until after this Honourable Court decides whether there is a genuine issue or an abuse of process.
[6]
4. As to venue, Toronto is the most convenient for all parties and their solicitors, other than for the solicitors for the plaintiff.
[7]
The defendants rely on rule 419(c) and (f) and rules 432.1 - 432.7.
Comments
Rule 419:
[8]
Rule 419 is the general provision permitting the court to strike a pleading. Rule 419(c) refers to scandalous, frivolous or vexatious pleadings and rule 419(f) refers to an abuse of process situation.
[9]
Recently, Teitelbaum, J., reviewed the jurisprudence with respect to rule 419 (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at pp. 213-214).
"The general rule in an application to strike a statement of claim was recently stated by Mr. Justice Dubé of this court in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], at page 3:
'Il est constant en matière de radiation que la Cour doit considérer comme prouvées les allégations de fait contenues dans la ou les plaidoiries en question. De plus, le requérant doit démontrer qu'il est clair et évident que la plaidoirie visée ne divulgue aucune cause raisonnable d'action.'
"[para. 11] Therefore, in determining the issue of whether or not to strike a statement of claim, the facts alleged in the relevant pleadings are to be considered as true and the applicant (defendants in this case) must show that it is clear and obvious that the pleading shows no reasonable cause of action, that is, that it is clear and obvious that the plaintiff could not succeed in its action (see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
"[para. 12] Insofar as an application to strike pursuant to rule 419(c) and (f), in the case of
Blackfoot Indian Band No. 146 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where he best described the rule's application.
. . . . .
"(3) Finally, in my view, a statement of claim should not be ordered to be struck out on the ground that it is vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of the process of the court, for the sole reason that in the opinion of the presiding judge, plaintiff's action should be dismissed. In my opinion, a presiding judge should not make such an order unless it be obvious that the plaintiff's action is so clearly futile that it has not the slightest chance of succeeding, whoever the judge may be before whom the case could be tried. It is only in such a situation that the plaintiff should be deprived of the opportunity of having 'his day in court'."
[10]
The issue to be decided in this action is whether the plaintiff is the registered owner of the trademark.
(i) Registered Owner Of Trademark
[11]
At paragraph 8 of the statement of claim, the plaintiff states that it is the "registered owner in Canada of Trademark registration number TMA 418,748, for the Trademark MAGMA & DESIGN, for use in Canada in association with the wares described as prerecorded video cassettes". Clearly, if the plaintiff was the registered trademark owner it would be able to commence an action for infringement. The text of the
Act
clearly leaves the right of the trademark owner to sue for infringement to be implied from the terms of the
Act
:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 24 (T.D.). The defendants, however, contend that the plaintiff is not the registered owner of the trademark, that the registered owner is MTC Bild und Tontrager GmbH. Pursuant to the case law discussed above, the onus is on the defendants to disprove the facts alleged in the statement of claim.
[12]
The defendants in the instant case have successfully discharged this onus. The plaintiff is not the registered owner of the Trademark. Filed with the statement of defence is a certified copy of the current registration status indicating MTC Bild und Tontrager GmbH as registered owner of the Trademark in Canada. By assignment filed July 27, 1993, and following some confusion at the trademark office, MTC Bild und Tontrager GmbH became registered owner in Canada. Further, the assignment to the plaintiff, dated April 14, 1994, was invalid.
Rules 432.1 - 432.7:
[13]
These Summary Judgment Rules were added January 13, 1994. They provide that a judge shall grant judgment if there is "no genuine issue for trial", or even if there is such "genuine issue", judgment may nevertheless be granted if on the whole of the evidence the judge is unable to find the facts necessary to decide the questions of fact or law.
[14]
I have seen only one case where these rules had been considered.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Reed, J., stated at p. 103:
"[para. 15] In my view, rules 432.1 and following should be interpreted by reference to their own textual framework. Rule 432.3(4) provides that summary judgment should not be granted on an issue when (1) on the whole of the evidence the judge cannot find the necessary facts or (2) it would be unjust to do so. These are the criteria which must be considered, not an analysis of whether or not a claim is characterized as an equitable set-off."
Conclusion
[15]
There is no genuine issue for trial with respect to the statement of claim filed herein in that all remedies sought are based upon the pleading that the plaintiff is the registered owner of the trademark in suit; and it is not. This is not a case for the application of rules 432.1 - 432.7 which would have the effect, in my view, of ruling out the plaintiff's right to file and serve a further statement of claim. Accordingly, the statement of claim herein is struck but without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to file such further and other statement of claim as it deems appropriate.
[16]
This decision of course has the effect of removing the basis for the plaintiff's application filed earlier for an interim injunction and which had been adjourned to July 14, 1994, by my colleague Strayer, J. That application is therefore dismissed.
[17]
The defendants are entitled to their costs of this motion and the motion for an interim injunction.
Order accordingly.
