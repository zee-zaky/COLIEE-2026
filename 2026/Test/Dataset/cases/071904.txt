Dénault, J.
[Translation]: The applicant is seeking judicial review of the decision of the Director of the Extraordinary Assistance Plan for Thalidomide Victims denying her application for assistance under the
HIV-infected persons and Thalidomide Victims Assistance Order
, P.C. 1990-4/872, as amended.
[2]
The main issue in the case at bar is whether, by providing the applicant with documents stating that she was entitled to a hearing on her application, the Director of the Plan, Greg Smith, created a reasonable expectation on her part that she had a right to such a hearing and whether he erred in refusing to hold such a hearing. The court must also decide whether the respondent Smith established exorbitant requirements in respect of the conditions under which the Order applied.
[3]
When she was born in 1961, the applicant had a deformity of the left forearm: her hand up to the wrist was almost completely missing. Other children were born at that time with deformities that were ultimately attributed to their mothers having taken a drug called KEVADON, the brand name of thalidomide. In 1990 the federal government established a program to compensate thalidomide victims in response to pressure from certain associations. The original Order provided that thalidomide victims would share the $7,500,000 invested in the program. An amendment to the Order on December 16, 1991 (P.C. 1991-7/2543) increased the amount available to $8,500,000 and divided "Thalidomide deformities" into three categories [See footnote 1]. Essentially, the Order provided for "ex gratia" payment of compensation to thalidomide victims who were permanent residents of Canada and alive at the time of payment. All applications had to be submitted to the Minister before September 1, 1991.
[4]
With respect to the main issues in the case at bar, it is important to analyse the course of events that led to the denial of the applicant's application for assistance, as set out in the record.
[5]
The applicant applied for registration in the assistance program on February 4, 1991 (Applicant's Record (A.R.) at p. 22). In June 1991 she received a letter (A.R. at pp. 23-26) from the Director of the Plan enclosing two documents: an Application for Assistance under the Extraordinary Assistance Plan (A.R. at pp. 34-35) and Information about the Plan (A.R. at pp. 27-32). The Information document, which was presented in the form of questions and answers, explained how to make an application and provided in part as follows:
"How Are Applications Reviewed?
Health and Welfare Canada has contracted with Ontario Blue Cross for assistance in administering the Extraordinary Assistance Plan.
You should send your application and supporting documentation to Health and Welfare Canada, where your eligibility will be determined. When this review is complete your application will be forwarded to Blue Cross in Toronto, for review by an independent Medical Reviewer. The Medical Reviewer is responsible for determining the category you are in for purposes of the disability-based payment. The Medical Reviewer may ask you to provide additional information, or to undergo medical examination by an independent physician, to assist your claim. The cost of this examination will be paid by Health and Welfare Canada.
When you apply, you have the right to choose between having your application adjudicated in a hearing in which you may appear yourself and/or be represented
or having your application reviewed only on the basis of material and information you send.
If you choose a hearing, every effort will be made to arrange a date and location convenient to you. The hearing will be informal and confidential
.
Your application and the medical reviewer's recommendation will be reviewed by an independent person designated by Health and Welfare Canada, to ensure that the recommendation was reached in a proper manner. This provides protection both for you and the taxpayers of Canada. The final decision in each case rests with the Minister of National Health and Welfare. You will be notified in writing of the Minister's decision." (My emphasis)
[6]
In the Application prepared by Health and Welfare Canada, the applicant was also asked to choose how she wanted her application reviewed:
□	I wish to have my application adjudicated on the basis of the written material and information.
□	I wish to have my application adjudicated in a hearing at which I may appear or be represented.
[7]
The applicant made her choice in the application she signed on July 30, 1991 (A.R. at pp. 162-163): she wanted her application to be adjudicated in a hearing at which she could appear or be represented.
[8]
No such hearing was ever held. On September 27, 1991, without hearing the applicant, the Director denied her application for the first time [See footnote 2] on the ground that she did not meet the Plan's eligibility criteria "
since the documents you submitted to us do not prove that your mother took Kevadon or Talimol during the first trimester of her pregnancy
. (A.R. at p. 37)" He also denied her a hearing, stating that "
the purpose of a hearing is to establish the disability level for individuals who meet the eligibility criteria
." (A.R. at p. 38). The applicant protested this decision through an attorney whom she had hired by that time to represent her. Shortly thereafter the attorney sent the Director a statement by the applicant's mother, who asserted that she had taken Kevadon in the first few months of her pregnancy, (A.R. at p. 42) a statement by the pharmacist's assistant at the pharmacy where she said she obtained the drug (A.R. at p. 44) and an initial statement by Dr. Conrad Rousseau certifying that he had prescribed Kevadon to the applicant's mother (A.R. at p. 49). Despite this evidence, on March 26, 1992 the Director again denied the applicant's application for compensation for the following reasons (A.R. at p. 51):
"I regret to inform you that the documentation you forwarded to us contains no evidence to establish that Ms. Mercier-Néron is a thalidomide victim. The statement by Conrad Rousseau is not a solemn declaration, nor is it based on any fact or belief. Moreover, it does not contain any information about Conrad Rousseau's knowledge or certainty of the circumstances surrounding your client's birth or about the records he kept concerning Rita Mercier. Likewise, the statement does not provide sufficient evidence to establish that Rita Mercier took Kevadon or Talimol while pregnant or that the deformities resulted from thalidomide."
[9]
It is this decision that is the subject of the application for judicial review brought on April 28, 1992. It should be noted that despite this application, which was based primarily on the refusal to grant the applicant a hearing, the Director did not terminate his review of the case. In a letter to counsel for the applicant dated May 13, 1992 the Director seemed to soften his position and now offered to allow him [Translation] "
to supplement the documentation that you submitted, particularly Dr. Rousseau's statement
." (A.R. at pp. 169-170)." However, he now imposed certain conditions:
"It should be noted that the statement by your client's mother is vague and imprecise on certain points. It is therefore insufficient unless supported by a sworn statement by Dr. Rousseau as described above.
"Your client's eligibility for the assistance program could be established if Dr. Rousseau's existing statement were sworn and if Dr. Rousseau stated therein:
- that when he treated your client's mother and when your client was born, he was a physician duly licensed to practise;
- precisely why he prescribed Kevadon to your client's mother;
- during what trimester of the mother's pregnancy he prescribed this drug to her;
- precisely why, in his recollection, he prescribed this drug to this woman.
"Of course, Dr. Rousseau will have to provide satisfactory answers to the points raised and in this regard we reserve the right to cross-examine Dr. Rousseau on his affidavit."
Thus, while the statement by the applicant's mother was described as vague and imprecise, a sworn statement was required from Dr. Rousseau, its content was specified and the right to cross-examine him was reserved.
[10]
Counsel for the applicant filed a new statement (A.R. at p. 60), this time a sworn one, by the attending physician and counsel for the respondents even examined (A.R. at pp. 61-113) Dr. Rousseau on his statement. In the meantime, the applicant's mother had also filed a second statement (A.R. at p. 59), this time a sworn one, in which she provided more details and described the problems she had encountered in her communications with the respondent Smith. The Director, who was still not satisfied with this new evidence, made a final decision on March 10, 1993 in which he again refused to recognize that the applicant met the Order's requirements on the ground that "
the record as a whole ... does not contain information that is sufficiently serious, precise and consistent to justify the inference that the [applicant's] mother took Kevadon or Talimol
." (A.R. at pp. 177-178).
[11]
For the purposes of the case at bar, counsel for the respondents has admitted that the Director's three decisions on September 27, 1991, March 26, 1992 and March 10, 1993 form a single unit, at least as regards the applicant's main argument that there was no hearing, and that in this sense the application for judicial review was directed against all of these decisions.
[12]
In his memorandum counsel for the applicant listed what he considered the six conditions that must be met to be entitled to apply for compensation. [See footnote 3] At the hearing counsel for the respondents acknowledged that the only reason the applicant's application was denied was the failure to prove condition 2 -- that Kevadon was taken during the first trimester of pregnancy -- and stated that he was prepared to admit that if this condition were proved, the respondents would accept that the applicant's deformity was a "
Thalidomide deformity
" (condition 3) within the meaning of the Order.
[13]
Counsel for the applicant made several arguments in support of the application for judicial review, including the Director's failure to hold a hearing and the high standard of proof he imposed on the applicant given the circumstances. He also criticized the Director for breaching his duty to give appropriate information to the applicant, inter alia about the evidence that he required from her, and for discriminating against the applicant by agreeing to compensate other persons whose names were on a government list or who had obtained a judgment or settlement following legal proceedings.
[14]
The court will first consider the holding of a hearing. The documents sent to the applicant offered her a hearing and she opted for one, but a hearing was subsequently denied. In administrative law it is settled that an administrative body has a duty to act fairly in making an administrative decision applicable to an individual case when the decision is important and may have serious consequences for the person concerned. Of course, the requirements of procedural fairness vary with the circumstances of each case (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 671; 78 C.L.L.C. 14,181). The duty to act fairly must be complied with even when the government, responsible as here for implementing a program of "ex gratia" payments established by order in council, derives its enabling power from the royal prerogative. The performance of this function may also be reviewed by the courts (Paul Lordon
Crown Law
(Toronto: Butterworths, 1991), at pp. 431-434).
[15]
In the case at bar, the documents that the Director sent the applicant when she registered for the assistance program clearly stated that an application could be adjudicated either on the basis of written material and information or in a hearing at which the applicant could appear or be represented. In my opinion, the respondents thereby created a legitimate expectation on the applicant's part that she had a right to a hearing. She availed herself of this right and therefore expected that, when she appeared or was represented at such a hearing, she could give a complete explanation of all the circumstances surrounding the events that occurred before her birth more than 30 years earlier. Proof of these events necessarily involved the testimony of the parties thereto and an explanation of the lack of physical evidence. [See footnote 4]
[16]
In addition, the sworn statement by the respondent Smith shows that he considered it possible that an application for assistance could be granted even if there were no monetary settlement with the manufacturers, no inclusion on the 1962-63 study list and no contemporary physical or documentary evidence (Paragraph 55 of Greg Smith's statement (A.R. at p. 120)). He stated that where an application contained no contemporary evidence, it was sufficient for it to contain persuasive evidence that the mother had taken Kevadon (Greg Smith's statement, para. 56 (A.R. at p. 120)). In his memorandum counsel for the respondent admitted that the applicant's application fell under this method or approach (Respondents' Record at 7, para. 17.). Although it was stated that the applicant's application was analysed on the basis that she had no contemporary documents showing that her mother took Kevadon, it was because of the lack of such documents that the respondent Smith denied the application on September 27, 1991 on the ground that "
the documents you submitted to us do not prove that your mother took Kevadon
". At the very least, the respondent Smith did not provide the proper reasons to justify his dismissal of the applicant's application.
[17]
In the same decision on September 27, 1991 the respondent Smith denied the applicant a hearing on the ground, as stated above, that "
the purpose of a hearing is to establish the disability level for individuals who meet the eligibility criteria
". The court cannot see this reason for refusing to hold a hearing as justified. Nothing in the Application or Information provided by the respondents could have led the applicant to think she would be entitled to a hearing solely to establish her disability level and not to establish her eligibility for the assistance program. On the contrary, in the Information provided by the Director (A.R. at p. 27 et seq., particularly at p. 30) it was clearly stated that the purpose of the application was to determine the applicant's eligibility and that it was only once this step was completed that the application would be forwarded to Blue Cross in Toronto for review by an independent medical reviewer. Insofar as in this respect the applicant had a legitimate expectation that she was entitled to a hearing and applied therefor, the respondent breached his duty of procedural fairness by refusing to hold one.
[18]
Since no hearing was held the court can only speculate on what the result of one might have been. Perhaps the testimony of the applicant's mother or other witnesses would have persuaded the respondent that she had taken Kevadon in the first trimester of her pregnancy even in the absence of contemporary documentary evidence. Moreover, in my opinion the consistent and uncontradicted statements by the applicant's mother and Dr. Rousseau, as well as the other circumstances discussed above (see footnote 4), provide information that is sufficiently serious, precise and consistent to justify the inference that the applicant's mother took Kevadon.
[19]
In light of the conclusion the court has reached on the respondent's failure to hold a hearing, it does not seem necessary to deal with the other arguments made by counsel for the applicant.
[20]
The applicant's application for judicial review is therefore allowed.
[21]
During the hearing, counsel for the respondent stated that the applicant's application for compensation was the last one not yet disposed of by the Assistance Plan and that funds had been set aside for this purpose in the event that the applicant were to succeed in her application for judicial review. As well, counsel for the applicant requested that if a hearing occurs, it be held before someone other than Director Greg Smith. Although he apparently no longer holds this position, the facts in the record do not lead me to believe that, by his actions, he no longer has the impartiality needed to adjudicate this case. In any event, under the Order it is for the Minister to decide this matter.
[22]
Under rule 1618 of the
Rules
of this court, no costs are payable in respect of an application for judicial review unless the court, for special reasons, so orders. In my opinion, no such special reasons have been shown.
Order
[23]
The court:
- ALLOWS the applicant's application for judicial review;
- SETS ASIDE the decision of the respondent Greg Smith to deny the applicant's application for assistance under the
HIV-infected persons and Thalidomide Victims Assistance Order
;
- REFERS the matter back to the Minister for a decision on the applicant's application for assistance in light of the reasons for this order.
Application allowed.
