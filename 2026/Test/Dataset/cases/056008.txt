Rouleau, J.
: This is an appeal from a decision of the Citizenship Judge dated January 12, 1990, refusing Ms. Hokoyem a grant of citizenship on the basis that she could not speak either English or French after being here for four years; that she did not demonstrate a sufficient knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; as a result she failed to meet the requirements of ss. 5(1)(d) and (e) of the Citizenship Act. The Citizenship Judge also declined to make a recommendation under s. 15(1) of the Act requesting that the Minister exercise his discretion under s. 5(3) or (4) to grant citizenship on compassionate grounds or for reasons of special hardship.
[2]
Although the Citizenship Judge's letter to the appellant dated January 17, 1990, stated that she found no facts or circumstances to support a recommendation to the Minister, the "Notice to the Minister" of her decision provides the following reasons:
"The applicant, 59 years of age, has been landed in Canada for almost four years. She cannot speak a word of either official language, as I found when asking her questions about herself - (e.g. what is your name? what is your address? where do you live? when is your birthday? where were you born? etc.) I tried to conduct a hearing with interpretation by her sons, but she could answer no question. She attended, they said, ESL classes but only for three months and then dropped out. Her son said he didn't encourage her to remain in class because he needed her as babysitter. I explained the hazards, lack of safety and security (for her grandchild as well), lack of independence and of pleasure inherent in her inability to communicate at all in either official language and encouraged the family to help her to resume classes. In compliance with ss. 5(1)(d) and 5(1)(e) the application is not approved.
"When I enquired about her health, her son said that during her first year in Canada she had phelbitis but since then, her health did not prevent her from learning French or English."

However, it is evidenct that the Citizenship Judge merely indicated that she was not prepared to make a recommendation to the Minister under s. 5(3) or (4), but failed to indicate that she had considered the relevant factors.

Ms. Hokayem is 60 years old. She was born in Lebanon and upon her arrival in Canada was granted permanent resident status on May 16, 1986. Her children are Canadian citizens, and since coming to Canada she has occupied herself in caring for her grand-children. She was never given an opportunity to attend school, and cannot read or write her native language (Arabic); she has never worked outside of the home. Although she did attend a course in "English as a Second Language" for two to three months when she first came to Canada, she made no progress, and eventually had to quit because of illness.
[5]
In light of the foregoing, there appears to be no reason that the appellant should not at this stage be favourably considered for citizenship. It is unlikely that a woman of her age, illiterate in her native language, can at this stage learn English or French; she is gainfully employed in caring for her grandchildren and has strong family support in this country. I would note that the circumstances of this case are very similar to that considered in Re Aboumalhab (1987), 17 F.T.R. 180, where Mr. Justice Pinard recommended that the Minister exercise his discretion to grant citizenship on humanitarian grounds.
[6]
Because there is some dispute as to whether judges of this court have such jurisdiction to make recommendations to the Minister (see The Minister of State (Multiculturalism and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to return this matter to the Citizenship Court and urge them to consider the factors outlined as to whether or not to recommend that the Minister favourably exercise his discretion under s. 5(3).
[7]
The appeal is allowed in part and the matter returned to the Citizenship Judge for a determination under s. 15(1).
Appeal allowed in part.
