I. Introduction
[1]
Scott, J.
: This is an application for judicial review filed under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
], from a decision of the immigration officer (Officer) refusing to grant permanent residence status to Victor Hugo Morales (Mr. Morales) or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligation for an application on humanitarian and compassionate considerations under subsection 25(1) of the
IRPA
.
[2]
For the following reasons, this application for judicial review is dismissed.
II. Facts
[3]
Mr. Morales, a citizen of Chile, is a professional musician. He immigrated to Canada in 1978, shortly before he turned 8 years old and became a permanent resident.
[4]
He is the father of three children. His eldest son is from his first marriage; he lives in Ontario and has little or no relationship with his father.
[5]
His two younger sons, aged 14 and 15, are from a second marriage. Mr. Morales was divorced on February 23, 2004. The divorce decree granted custody of the children to his spouse. Mr. Morales claims that he is actively involved with his sons; he ensures that he is present in their lives.
[6]
Mr. Morales has had a troubled past because he was both a witness to and a victim of violence at the hands of his father. As a teenager, he developed a dependency on alcohol and drugs until 2004. Since then, has allegedly been rehabilitated, with only one temporary relapse in 2008.
[7]
Between 1994 and 2004, Mr. Morales pled guilty to 12 criminal offences, including possession of drugs with the intent to traffic, possession of drugs, possession of break-in instruments, accessory to robbery, impaired driving and threats and assault.
[8]
A deportation order was issued against Mr. Morales on March 26, 1997, because of his criminal offences. Consequently, he lost his permanent resident status, which he received after he arrived in Canada.
[9]
Mr. Morales appealed this decision. On February 24, 1998, the Immigration and Refugee Board's Immigration Appeal Division [IRB-IAD] dismissed his appeal and upheld the removal order.
[10]
Between 1998 and 2008, Mr. Morales had four arrest warrants issued against him for failing to appear for investigation and removal from Canada.
[11]
In February 2009, Mr. Morales filed an Application for Pre-Removal Risk Assessment [PRRA], which was refused on November 4, 2010.
[12]
On April 29, 2009, Mr. Morales applied under humanitarian considerations [H&C] to be exempt from the inadmissibility affecting him and from the obligation to file his application for permanent residence from outside Canada.
[13]
The H&C application was refused on October 28, 2010. The Officer concluded that Mr. Morales failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he would experience any unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he were required to file his application for permanent residence abroad, taking into consideration the best interests of his children who are directly affected.
III. Legislation
[14]
Subsection 25(1) of the
IRPA
reads as follows:
Humanitarian and compassionate considerations - request of foreign national
25. (1) The Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.
Séjour pour motif d'ordre humanitaire à la demande de l'étranger
25. (1) Le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.
IV. Issue and standard of review
A. Issue
[15]
This application for judicial review only raises a single issue:
•
Did the Officer err by finding that the applicant would not experience any unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he were required to file his application for permanent residence for humanitarian and compassionate considerations abroad?
B. Standard of review
[16]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] SCJ No 9 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Supreme Court of Canada found that, at paragraph 62 of its decision, when determining the appropriate standard of review, the first step is to "ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question".
[17]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 497 at paras 22-25).
[18]
Therefore, the Court must consider "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47).
V. Position of the parties
A. Position of Mr. Morales
[19]
Mr. Morales submits that he has been well integrated in Canada since 1978, that his entire family lives there and that he does not know his country of birth, Chile.
[20]
He states that the Officer's decision violates the Canada's international commitments on children's rights. Mr. Morales points out that in enacting the
IRPA
, Canada adopted, among others, the objective of encouraging family reunification. Therefore, the Officer had to take into account the best interests of his children, which she did not do. He submitted that his two minor sons depend on him because he takes care of their education, their health-in short, their well-being.
[21]
Mr. Morales alleges that the Officer's decision was in excess of her jurisdiction since she failed to comply with the principle of proportionality, an important principle in international law.
[22]
He further submitted that the Officer ignored, disregarded without reason and refused to consider several pieces of evidence filed in support of the application on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
[23]
Mr. Morales believes that the decision was without merit and arbitrary since it was contrary to the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part 1 of The
Constitution Act
,
1982
, being Schedule B to the
Canada Act, 1982
, (UK), 1982, c 11 [
Charter
]. He claims that removing him would violate his rights to life and security under section 7 of the
Charter
since it would lead to a disproportional situation for his family, in particular for his mother for whom he is the primary informal caregiver and his two minor children.
B. Respondent's position
[24]
The respondent relies on the Officer's decision. He submits that it carefully reviews all aspects of the H&C application filed by Mr. Morales. All the documents and information provided were considered. Contrary to what Mr. Morales argues, the Officer was not disregarding the letters written by his family. She weighed their relevance as evidence.
[25]
The Officer considered Mr. Morales's immigration and criminal history. She then reviewed his children's situation to determine what is in their best interests. She also considered the degree to which Mr. Morales is established in Canada. The respondent submitted that the Officer is alert, alive and sensitive to the best interests of the children.
[26]
The respondent submitted that the best interests of the children do not automatically result in a favourable response to an H&C application. This criterion is one of many.
[27]
The respondent alleges that Mr. Morales is attempting to minimize his criminal past. It cannot be said that these crimes were only minor and without violence. The respondent submits that the Officer had to pay careful attention to Mr. Morales's criminal past, which she did.
[28]
The respondent also notes that it cannot be said that Mr. Morales has been a good citizen for six years since a warrant was issued for his arrest in August 2008. In addition, he did not file an income tax return for several years, which shows his lack of respect toward the Canadian authorities.
VI. Analysis
[29]
"In applications for exemption based on H&C considerations, the decision-making procedure is entirely discretionary and is used to determine whether an exemption is justified" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] FCJ No 1552 at para 7;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FCJ No 220 at para 15[ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Thus, the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that the hardship that he would face, if he had to file his application for permanent residence abroad, are unusual, undeserved or disproportionate (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] FCJ No 457 at para 23).
[30]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 425, Justice de Montigny explained the meaning of the words "unusual and undeserved or disproportionate". In paragraph 20 of the decision, he wrote:
In assessing an application for landing from within Canada on Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds made pursuant to section 25, the Immigration Officer is provided with Ministerial guidelines. Immigration Manual IP5 - Immigration Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds, a manual put out by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada, provides guidelines on what is meant by Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds ...
...
The IP5 Manual goes on to define "unusual and undeserved" hardship and "disproportionate" hardship. It states, at paragraphs 6.7 and 6.8:
6.7 Unusual and undeserved hardship
Unusual and undeserved hardship is:
- the hardship (of having to apply for a permanent resident visa from outside of Canada) that the applicant would have to face should be, in most cases, unusual, in other words, a hardship not anticipated by the Act or Regulations; and
- the hardship (of having to apply for a permanent resident visa from outside of Canada) that the applicant would face should be, in most cases, the result of circumstances beyond the person's control.
6.8 Disproportionate hardship
Humanitarian and compassionate grounds may exist in cases that would not meet the "unusual and undeserved" criteria but where the hardship (of having to apply for a permanent resident visa from outside of Canada) would have a disproportionate impact on the applicant due to their personal circumstances.
[31]
Hardship that is inherent in having to leave Canada is insufficient in itself to exempt an applicant under subsection 25(1) of the
IRPA
(see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 16).
[32]
Mr. Morales submitted that the Officer erred by failing to consider the evidence before her. The respondent takes the opposite position.
[33]
There is a presumption that the Officer considered the evidence as a whole before making a decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] FCJ No 516).
[34]
In this case, the Court finds that the Officer considered all the evidence before her. She wrote: "Applicant submitted a letter from his youngest son [and from] ex wife and her sister ... I grant little weight to these documents as they constitute interested proof as they were probably written in the sole goal of supporting the Application for permanent residence" (page 18 of the Tribunal Record). The Officer considered the evidence filed by Mr. Morales, but she gave them little probative value, given that they came from interested parties. Indeed, the Court recognized that the Officer's wording was not very good, but she exercised her discretion as mandated to her under the law.
[35]
In addition, Mr. Morales submitted that the Officer ignored the best interests of his children. The Court wishes to reiterate that the case law establishes that the best interests of the child are certainly an important factor, but are not determinative (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[36]
The Court believes that the Officer is alert, alive and sensitive to the child's situation. She devoted part of her decision to analyzing the best interests of the children and found that the evidence submitted does not establish that the hardship alleged by Mr. Morales would be unusual and undeserved or disproportionate. The Officer pointed out "the information before me does not demonstrate that neither the Applicant's level of implication nor that it would cause his children harm if ties were severed ... No evidence [were] submitted as to whether or not the Applicant provides financial support for any of his 3 children" (page 18 of the Tribunal Record).
[37]
The Officer reviewed Mr. Morales's immigration history and his criminal record. She noted that Mr. Morales "has a Criminal History over many years which resulted in his Permanent residence being revoked" (page 20 of the Tribunal Record). She also noted that four arrest warrants were issued against him in 1998 and 2008 for failing to appear for investigation and removal from Canada. She points out that Mr. Morales has only filed four income tax returns since he has been in Canada, during the years 2006 to 2009, reporting an income of $0. The Officer gave some weight to this evidence, which shows a limited degree of establishment in Canada. The Officer has broad discretion when assessing the evidence before her (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 62). She may determine the relevance of the evidence for the purposes of the H&C application.
[38]
Mr. Morales pointed out his role as primary informal caregiver for his mother since his brothers and sisters are working full time and cannot take care of their mother. However, the Officer found that it was reasonable to believe that the applicant's brothers and sisters could help their mother during his absence.
[39]
The Officer acknowledges that after 30 years in Canada, Mr. Morales has been able to integrate in certain respects. However, she found that the evidence in the file do not support Mr. Morales's claims that the hardship that he would encounter, if he had to apply for permanent residence from Chile, are not unusual and undeserved or disproportionate. The Officer's assessment seems to be reasonable.
[40]
"This Court is not to lightly interfere with the discretion given to an H&C officer ... As long as the H&C officer considers the relevant, appropriate factors from an H&C perspective, the Court cannot interfere with the weight the H&C officer gives to the different factors, even if it would have weighed the factors differently" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 1408 at para 24).
[41]
Mr. Morales also submitted that his removal to Chile is inconsistent with section 7 and sections 12, 15 and 27 of the
Charter
.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 668, the Court explained: "Paragraph 3(3)(
f
) of the IRPA does not require that an officer exercising discretion under s.25 of the IRPA specifically refer to and analyse the international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory. It is sufficient if the Officer addresses the substance of the issues raised", which she did in this case.
[42]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 46, the Supreme Court of Canada wrote: "The most fundamental principle of immigration law is that non-citizens do not have an unqualified right to enter or remain in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ... Thus the deportation of a non-citizen in itself cannot implicate the liberty and security interests protected by s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
". The Officer's decision is not inconsistent with Mr. Morales's rights to liberty and security. Furthermore, no evidence was submitted to the Officer to establish that Mr. Morales would be a victim of cruel and unusual treatment if he had to file his permanent residence application from his country of origin.
[43]
Mr. Morales also based his objection on section 15 of the Charter. The Supreme Court of Canada wrote on this topic at paragraph 105 of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : "A majority of this Court has held that the objective of s. 15 is to affirm the dignity of individuals and groups by protecting them from unfair governmental action, which differentiates on the basis of characteristics that can be changed, if at all, only at great personal cost". This excerpt from Gosselin is a reminder that removal of a person does not constitute unfair government action that differentiates on the basis of characteristics that can be changed, especially when this person has a serious criminal past (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 920 at para 36). Mr. Morales failed to establish that he has suffered an injustice under section 15 of the Charter.
VII. Conclusion
[44]
Mr. Morales failed to establish that the Officer erred in assessing the evidence or the applicable law when she reviewed his application under subsection 25(1) of the
IRPA
, which would warrant this Court's intervention. Therefore, this application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[45]
THE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed; and
2. There is no question of general interest to certify.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Scott
[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée aux termes de l'article 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001 c 27 [
LIPR
] qui vise la décision de l'agente d'immigration (l'agente) refusant d'octroyer le statut de résident permanent à Monsieur Victor Hugo Morales (Monsieur Morales) ou de lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables à une demande pour des considérations d'ordre humanitaire aux termes de l'article 25(1) de la
LIPR
.
[2]
Pour les raisons qui suivent, cette demande de révision judiciaire est rejetée.
II. Faits
[3]
Monsieur Morales, un citoyen du Chili, est musicien de profession. Il immigre au Canada en 1978, peu avant l'âge de 8 ans et devient résident permanent.
[4]
Il est le père de trois enfants. Son fils majeur est issu de son premier mariage, il habite l'Ontario et entretient peu ou pas de relation avec son père.
[5]
Ses deux autres fils mineurs, âgés de 14 et 15 ans, proviennent d'un second mariage. Monsieur Morales se divorce le 23 février 2004. Le jugement de divorce confie la garde des enfants à son épouse. Monsieur Morales prétend s'occuper activement de ses garçons, il assure une présence dans leur vie.
[6]
M. Morales connaît un passé difficile puisqu'il est à la fois témoin et victime de violence aux mains de son père. Dès son adolescence, il développe une dépendance à l'alcool et aux drogues, et ce, jusqu'en 2004. Depuis, il serait réhabilité, n'ayant connu qu'une rechute passagère en 2008.
[7]
Entre 1994 et 2004, M. Morales plaide coupable à douze infractions criminelles; notamment de possession de stupéfiants dans le but d'en faire le trafic, de possession de stupéfiants, de possession d'outils de cambriolage, de complicité de vol, de conduite avec facultés affaiblies ainsi que de menaces et voies de fait.
[8]
Une ordonnance d'expulsion est émise contre M. Morales le 26 mars 1997 à cause de ses infractions criminelles. De ce fait, il perd son statut de résident permanent qu'il a reçu suite à son arrivée au Canada.
[9]
M. Morales interjette appel de cette décision. Le 24 février 1998, la section d'appel de l'immigration de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [SAI-CISR] rejette son appel et confirme la mesure de renvoi.
[10]
Entre 1998 et 2008, M. Morales fait l'objet de quatre mandats d'arrestation pour défaut de s'être présenté aux fins d'enquête et de renvoi du Canada.
[11]
En février 2009 M. Morales dépose une demande d'évaluation des risques avant renvoi [ERAR], laquelle est rejetée le 4 novembre 2010.
[12]
Le 29 avril 2009, M. Morales fait une demande sous considérations humanitaires [CH] afin d'être exempté de l'interdiction de territoire qui le frappe et de l'obligation de présenter sa demande de résidence permanente de l'extérieur du Canada.
[13]
La demande de CH est rejetée le 28 octobre 2010. L'agente conclut que M. Morales n'a pas établi, par prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il subirait des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives s'il devait déposer sa demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de ses enfants qui sont directement touchés.
III. Législation
[14]
L'article 25(1) de la
LIPR
se lit comme suit:
Séjour pour motif d'ordre humanitaire à la demande de l'étranger
25. (1) Le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.
Humanitarian and compassionate considerations - request of foreign national
25. (1) The Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.
IV. Question en litige et norme de contrôle
A. Question en litige
[15]
Cette demande de révision ne soulève qu'une seule question en litige:
·
L'agente erre-t-elle en concluant que le demandeur ne subira pas de difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives à déposer sa demande de résidence permanente pour considérations humanitaires de l'étranger?
B. Norme de contrôle
[16]
Dans l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour suprême du Canada conclut, au paragraphe 62 de sa décision, que lorsqu'il faut déterminer la norme de contrôle applicable, la première étape est de « vérifie[r] si la jurisprudence établit déjà de manière satisfaisante le degré de déférence correspondant à une catégorie de questions en particulier ».
[17]
Dans l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para 62, la Cour suprême précise que la norme de contrôle applicable pour les décisions relatives aux demandes pour motifs d'ordre humanitaire est la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 497 aux paras 22-25).
[18]
Ainsi, la Cour doit considérer « la justification de la décision, [...] la transparence et [...] l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu[e] l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au para 47).
V. Position des parties
A. Position de M. Morales
[19]
M. Morales soutient qu'il est bien intégré au Canada depuis 1978, que toute sa famille y vit et qu'il ne connaît pas son pays d'origine, le Chili.
[20]
Il affirme que la décision de l'agente viole les engagements internationaux du Canada en matière des droits de l'enfant. M. Morales souligne qu'en adoptant la
LIPR
, le Canada adopte entre autres l'objectif de favoriser le regroupement des familles. L'agente devait ainsi tenir compte de l'intérêt supérieur des ses enfants, ce qu'elle n'a pas fait. Il soutient que ses deux garçons mineurs dépendent de lui puisqu'il s'occupe de leur éducation, de leur santé, bref de leur bien-être.
[21]
M. Morales allègue que la décision de l'agente excède sa compétence puisqu'elle ne respecte pas le principe de la proportionnalité, un principe important en droit international.
[22]
Il soutient de plus que l'agente ignore, écarte sans fondement et refuse de considérer plusieurs éléments de preuve déposés au soutien de la demande pour motifs d'ordre humanitaire.
[23]
M. Morales considère que la décision est mal fondée et arbitraire puisqu'elle va à l'encontre de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
, partie 1 de la
Loi constitutionnelle de 1982
, constituant l'annexe B de la
Loi de 1982 sur le Canada
(R-U), 1982, c 11 [
Charte
]. Il prétend que son renvoi violerait son droit à la vie et à la sécurité conféré par l'article 7 de la Charte puisqu'il engendrerait une situation disproportionnelle pour sa famille, plus particulièrement pour sa mère dont il est le premier aidant naturel et ses deux enfants mineurs.
B. Position du défendeur
[24]
Le défendeur se fonde sur la décision de l'agente. Il soutient qu'on y étudie attentivement tous les aspects de la demande de CH présentée par M. Morales. Tous les documents et renseignements fournis font l'objet de considérations. Contrairement à ce que plaide M. Morales, l'agente n'écarte pas les lettres écrites par sa famille. Elle soupèse leur pertinence comme élément de preuve.
[25]
L'agente se penche sur l'historique du dossier d'immigration et du dossier criminel de M. Morales. Elle étudie ensuite la situation de ses enfants afin de déterminer quel est leur intérêt supérieur. Elle considère également le degré d'établissement de M. Morales au Canada. Selon le défendeur, l'agente est réceptive, attentive et sensible à l'intérêt des enfants.
[26]
Le défendeur soutient que l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant n'entraine pas automatiquement une réponse favorable à une demande CH. Ce critère en est un parmi tant d'autres.
[27]
Le défendeur allègue que M. Morales tente de minimiser son passé criminel. Il serait faux d'affirmer qu'il s'agit de simples crimes mineurs et sans violence. Le défendeur soutient que l'agente devait porter une attention particulière au passé criminel de M. Morales, ce qu'elle a fait.
[28]
Le défendeur souligne également qu'il est faux d'affirmer que M. Morales est un bon citoyen depuis 6 ans puisqu'un mandat d'arrestation a été lancé contre lui en août 2008. De plus, il n'a pas déposé de déclaration de revenus pendant plusieurs années, ce qui témoigne de son manque de respect envers les autorités canadiennes.
VI. Analyse
[29]
« Le processus de décision pour les demandes CH est tout à fait discrétionnaire et sert à déterminer si l'octroi d'une exemption est justifié » (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 1552 au para 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 220 au para 15  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Il revient donc au demandeur de prouver que les difficultés auxquelles il devrait faire face, s'il doit déposer sa demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger, sont inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives (voir  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] ACF no 457 au para 23).
[30]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 425, le juge de Montigny explique le sens des mots "inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives". Au paragraphe 20 de la décision, il écrit:
Pour examiner les demandes d'établissement déposées au Canada pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire en vertu de l'article 25, l'agent d'immigration s'appuie sur des lignes directrices ministérielles. Le chapitre IP5 du Guide de l'immigration - Demande présentée par des immigrants au Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, un guide préparé par le ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration contient des lignes directrices sur le sens qu'il convient de donner aux motifs d'ordre humanitaire.
[...]
Le Manuel contient également une définition de "difficulté inhabituelle et injustifiée" et de "difficultés démesurées", aux paragraphes 6.7 et 6.8:
6.7 Difficulté inhabituelle et injustifiée
On appelle difficulté inhabituelle et injustifiée:
- la difficulté (de devoir demander un visa de résident permanent hors du Canada) à laquelle le demandeur s'exposerait serait, dans la plupart des cas, inhabituelle ou, en d'autres termes, une difficulté non prévue à la Loi ou à son Règlement; et
- la difficulté (de devoir demander un visa de résident hors du Canada) à laquelle le demandeur s'exposerait serait, dans la plupart des cas, le résultat de circonstances échappant au contrôle de cette personne.
6.7 Difficultés démesurées
Des motifs d'ordre humanitaire peuvent exister dans des cas n'étant pas considérés comme "inusités ou injustifiés", mais dont la difficulté (de présenter une demande de visa de résident permanent à l'extérieur de Canada) aurait des répercussions disproportionnées pour le demandeur, compte tenu des circonstances qui lui sont propres.
[31]
Les difficultés inhérentes au fait de quitter le Canada ne suffisent pas en soi pour exempter un demandeur sous l'article 25(1) de la
LIPR
(voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au para 16).
[32]
M. Morales soutient que l'agente commet une erreur en omettant de considérer les éléments de preuve devant elle. Le défendeur affirme le contraire.
[33]
Il existe une présomption voulant que l'agente ait considéré l'ensemble des éléments de preuve avant d'en arriver à une décision (TownsendcCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration), 2003 CFPI 371,[2003] ACF no 516).
[34]
En l'espèce, la Cour conclut que l'agente a considéré l'ensemble des éléments de preuve devant elle. Elle écrit "Applicant submitted a letter from his youngest son [and from] ex wife and her sister [...] I grant little weight to these documents as they constitutes interested proof as they were probably written in the sole goal of supporting the Application for permanent residence"(page 18 du dossier du tribunal). L'agente se penche sur les éléments de preuve déposés par M. Morales, elle leurs accordent cependant peu de force probante au motif qu'ils proviennent de personnes intéressées. Certes, la Cour reconnaît que la formulation de l'agente n'est pas dès plus habile, toutefois elle exerce son pouvoir discrétionnaire comme la loi le lui prescrit.
[35]
D'autre part, M. Morales soutient que l'agente fait fi de l'intérêt supérieur de ses enfants. La Cour tient à rappeler que la jurisprudence établit que l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant est certes un facteur important, mais non déterminant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[36]
La Cour croît que l'agente est réceptive, attentive et sensible à la situation de l'enfant. Elle consacre une partie de sa décision à l'analyse de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et conclut que les éléments de preuve présentés n'établissent pas que les difficultés alléguées par M. Morales seraient à la fois inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives. L'agente souligne "the information before me does not demonstrate that neither the Applicant's level of implication nor that it would cause his children harm if ties were severed [...] No evidence [were] submitted as to whether or not the Applicant provides financial support for any of his 3 children" (page 18 du dossier du tribunal).
[37]
L'agente étudie l'historique du dossier d'immigration de M. Morales ainsi que son dossier criminel. Elle souligne que M. Morales "has a Criminal History over many years which resulted in his Permanent residence being revoked"(page 20 du dossier du tribunal).Elle rappelle également que quatre mandats d'arrestations sont lancés contre lui entre 1998 et 2008 pour défaut de se présenter aux fins d'enquête et de renvoi du Canada. Elle souligne que M. Morales n'a présenté que quatre déclarations de revenus depuis qu'il est au Canada, soit au cours des années 2006 à 2009, reconnaissant un revenu de 0$. L'agente accorde un certain poids à cet élément de preuve qui démontre un niveau restreint d'intégration au Canada. L'agente possède une large discrétion lorsqu'elle évalue les éléments de preuve devant elle (voir  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 62). Elle peut déterminer la pertinence des éléments de preuve aux fins de la demande CH.
[38]
M. Morales fait valoir son rôle de premier aidant naturel de sa mère puisque ses frères et sœurs travaillent à temps plein, ils ne peuvent prendre soins de leur mère. L'agente conclut néanmoins qu'il est raisonnable de croire que les frères et sœurs du demandeur pourront aider leur mère durant son absence.
[39]
L'agente reconnaît qu'après 30 ans au Canada, M. Morales a pu s'intégrer à certains égards. Toutefois, elle conclut que les éléments de preuve au dossier ne soutiennent pas les prétentions de M. Morales voulant que les difficultés auxquelles il serait confronté, s'il devait faire sa demande de résidence permanente du Chili, ne soient pas inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives. Cette évaluation de l'agente nous apparaît raisonnable.

« Notre Cour ne doit pas s'immiscer à la légère dans l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire d'un agent CH [...] Dès lors que l
'
agent CH a tenu compte de facteurs d'ordre humanitaire pertinents et appropriés, la Cour ne modifiera pas l'appréciation que l'agent CHa fait de ces divers facteurs, même si elle avait apprécié ces facteurs différemment » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 1408 au para 24).
[41]
M. Morales soutient également que son renvoi au Chili irait à l'encontre de l'article 7 ainsi que des articles 12, 15 et 27 de la
Charte
. Dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 668, la Cour précise que « l'alinéa 3(3)
f
) de la
LIPR
n'exige pas qu'un[e] agent[e], lorsqu'il [elle] exerce le pouvoir discrétionnaire prévu par l'article 25 de la
LIPR
, mentionne expressément les instruments internationaux portant sur les droits de l'homme dont le Canada est signataire et en fasse l'analyse. Il suffit que l'agent[e] traite de la teneur de ces instruments », ce qu'elle fait en l'instance.
[42]
Dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para 46, la Cour Suprême du Canada écrit, « Le principe le plus fondamental du droit de l'immigration veut que les non-citoyens n'aient pas un droit absolu d'entrer ou de demeurer au  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ». À elle seule, l'expulsion d'un non-citoyen ne peut mettre en cause les droits à la liberté et à la sécurité garantis par l'art. 7 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés ». La décision de l'agente ne va pas à l'encontre des droits à la liberté et la sécurité de M. Morales. De plus, aucun élément de preuve n'est présenté à l'agente pour établir que M. Morales serait victime de traitements cruels et inusités s'il devait déposer sa demande de résidence permanente de son pays d'origine.
[43]
M. Morales fonde également sa contestation sur l'article 15 de la Charte. À ce sujet, la Cour Suprême du Canada écrit, au paragraphe 105 de l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « la Cour a statué à la majorité que l'article 15 a pour objectif de renforcer la dignité des personnes et des groupes, en les protégeant contre une intervention gouvernementale injuste qui établit une distinction fondée sur les caractéristiques modifiables seulement à un prix considérable, si tant est qu'elles puissent être modifiées ». Cet extrait de l'arrêt Gosselin nous rappelle que le renvoi d'une personne ne constitue pas une intervention gouvernementale injuste qui établit une distinction fondée sur les caractéristiques modifiables surtout lorsque cette personne traîne un passé criminel lourd (voir  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 920 au para 36). M. Morales n'a pas établi qu'il subit une injustice aux termes de l'article 15 de la Charte.
VII. Conclusion
[44]
M. Morales n'a pas établi que l'agente a commis des erreurs d'appréciation des éléments de preuve ou du droit applicable qui justifient l'intervention de cette Cour lorsqu'elle a étudié sa demande aux termes de l'article 25(1) de la
LIPR
. Conséquemment cette demande de révision judiciaire est rejetée.
JUGEMENT
