[1]
Mandamin, J.
: The Applicants apply for judicial review of the November 28, 2011 decision of a Member of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The RPD refused the Applicants' claims for refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (
IRPA
). The RPD determined that the Applicants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.
Background
[2]
The Applicants, Dr. Robins Strusberg Ramos, his spouse, Erika Irene Crespo Paez who is also a doctor, and their minor children, Ashley Strusberg Crespo and Caleb Joshua Strusberg Ramos, seek refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the
IRPA
. The Applicants are citizens of Columbia with the exception of Caleb who is a citizen of the United States of America (USA).
[3]
In early 2005, members of the United Self-Defence Forces of Columbia (AUC) approached Dr. Strusberg at his medical clinic and demanded that he pay them protection money. He acquiesced and made regular payments to the AUC. In early 2005, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC) demanded he make monthly payments to them as well.
[4]
In October 2007, an AUC leader asked Dr. Strusberg to purchase 12,000 doses of the medicine, Glucantime. Dr. Strusberg said he could not do so because it was a controlled substance. The AUC told Dr. Strusberg that he knew that Dr. Strusberg had treated members of the FARC, that he had paid members of the FARC and that he was under surveillance by the AUC as a FARC collaborator. Following that visit Dr. Strusberg began receiving threatening telephone calls from members of the AUC. They continued to insist that he provide them with the demanded medication and they also demanded a large additional payment. He complied with the monetary demand but continued to receive threatening phone calls.
[5]
In December 2007, the Applicants left Colombia for the USA. They returned to Colombia six months later in May 2008. In June the threatening calls began again. Graphic threats of sexual violence were directed against Ms. Crespo and their daughter, Ashley, resulting in Ms. Crespo suffering a miscarriage. The Applicants fled to the USA in August 2008 as soon as Ms. Crespo's medical condition permitted. Dr. Strusberg returned to Colombia every six months to renew his USA visa so he could live in the USA legally. Caleb was born in the USA on September 19, 2009.
[6]
Dr. Strusberg returned to Colombia in May 2010 to apply for a pardon related to Erika's status in the USA. On June 11, 2010, he received a threatening telephone call from the AUC. The caller told Robins that as an enemy of the AUC he would pay with his life. Dr. Strusberg was advised by his uncle, a prominent lawyer who had information from confidential sources that his life was in danger. Dr. Strusberg fled Colombia to the USA on July 6, 2010.
[7]
Dr. Strusberg entered Canada on August 21, 2010 and filed a claim for refugee protection on August 31, 2010. He was joined by Ms. Crespo, and their child, Caleb, on September 14, 2010. Their other child, Ashley, entered Canada on September 15, 2010. Their respective claims for refugee protection filed on their respective arrivals were all joined.
Decision Under Review
[8]
The RPD doubted the Applicants' subjective fear as they failed to seek asylum at the first opportunity in the USA and given their re-availment to Colombia.
[9]
The RPD also ruled the Applicants had not rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection. The RPD determined that the Applicants failed to show that they could not access adequate state protection in Colombia.
Issues
[10]
The issues that arise in this case are:
1. Did the RPD err in law in finding that the Applicants lacked subjective fear of persecution in Colombia, because the Applicants could and should have claimed asylum in the USA and because they re-availed themselves of the protection of Colombia?
2. Was the RPD's analysis of state protection in Colombia unreasonable?
Standard of Review
[11]
The Supreme Court of Canada held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] that there are only two standards of review: correctness for questions of law and reasonableness involving questions of mixed fact and law and fact. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 50 and 53. The Supreme Court also held that where the standard of review has been previously determined, a standard of review analysis need not be repeated. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 62.
[12]
The standard of reasonableness applies when determining whether an Applicant has established a subjective fear of persecution and whether a person is in need of protection.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[13]
Questions of the adequacy of state protection are "questions of mixed fact and law ordinarily reviewable against a standard of reasonableness."
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 413 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 38.
Analysis
Subjective Fear Assessment
[14]
The RPD stated that genuine refugee claimants would be expected to seek protection as soon as practical once out of the reach of their oppressors. The RPD rejected the adult Applicants' explanation for failing to file asylum claims in the United States. The RPD focused solely on the Applicants' explanation why they did not file refugee claims in the USA: two lawyers advised the Applicants that their claims would not be successful because of the protection money paid to terrorists.
[15]
The Applicants submit the RPD erred by failing to consider other material evidence. I agree. The evidence before the RPD was that once Ms. Crespo decided she would not return to Colombia after the May 2008 threats she tried to regularize her US status through sponsorship by her mother who was a US citizen. That approach was not successful because Ms. Crespo would have to first regularize her status by returning to Colombia which she was not prepared to do. Dr. Strusberg continued to return to Colombia until he was advised by his uncle that his life was in danger and he fled Colombia.
[16]
It is clear that the RPD did not consider Ms. Crespo's efforts to regularize her status in the USA since the RPD stated: "I am persuaded that if Robins and Erika were genuinely fearful of returning to Colombia
they would have made further attempts to normalize their status in the USA
." [emphasis added] On this point I am satisfied the RPD erred in not considering Ms. Crespo did make further efforts to regularize her status in the USA.
[17]
The Applicants also submit the RPD failed to grasp the evidence as to the Applicants' conduct regarding the re-availment. The Applicants argue that the first time the Applicants went back to Colombia as a family it was with the intention to settle back into their life in Colombia. When they fled in August 2008 as a result of the renewal of the threatening phone calls, Ms. Crespo and her daughter Ashley never returned to Colombia. Dr. Strusberg returned to Colombia because he wanted to get his life back in Colombia and tried to fix the problem. He finally abandoned that effort when he was warned his life was in danger.
[18]
The Respondent submits the RPD appreciated the Applicants' attempts to gain status in the USA. However, such temporary visa status is no substitute for the permanent status that refugee protection would afford. The Respondent argues the RPD appreciated why the Applicants returned to Colombia - their visitor's status in the USA had expired and their application for permanent status as members of the family class was refused. However, the Respondent submits the Applicants freely returned to Colombia when their status in the USA expired. They returned multiple times for extended periods on each occasion. The Respondent submits it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the Applicants' pattern of return constituted a re-availment to Colombia.
[19]
The RPD relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] which "suggests that a negative inference may be drawn in instances where a claimant takes sojourns outside of the country of alleged persecution and fails to take advantage of the opportunity to seek asylum elsewhere, and then re-avails him or herself." The RPD found the Applicants' actions were not consistent with subjective fear of persecution.
[20]
The RPD offers no reasons as to why the Applicants' explanations were not accepted. The RPD explanation conflates Ms. Crespo's single return with Dr. Strusberg's several returns and fails to have regard for the turning point for each Applicant when each came to their own realization that a return free from persecution was not possible.
[21]
The RPD drew its negative inference from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> without regard to the different circumstances of these Applicants from those applicants in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In doing so I find the RPD erred.
State Protection
[22]
The RPD found that the Applicants, in the circumstances of this case, had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.
[23]
The Applicants argue that the RPD's state protection analysis is completely inadequate as the RPD produced, for the most part, a "boilerplate" set of reasons in which the RPD spoke in generalities about the measures put in place by the Colombian state.
[24]
The Applicants also submit the RPD ignored several critical factors. The Applicants argue that not only had the Applicants been systematically targeted by the AUC over several years, but the group had shown its ability to locate Dr. Strusberg. The Applicants submit the RPD made no attempt to analyse the availability of state protection, as it should have, against the factual context of the risk the Applicants because of the targeting by the AUC.
[25]
The Respondent submits the RPD's state protection analysis is not boilerplate. The Respondent points out that the RPD was entitled to outline the general principles that apply as well as review the documentary evidence on the protection available in Colombia. The Respondent submits the RPD's careful review of both highlights the care that it applied when considering the state protection issue.
[26]
The Respondent notes the Supreme Court recently observed that reasons are not inadequate because they do not reference every piece of evidence.
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[27]
The Respondent submits the RPD did not ignore evidence of the Colombian authorities' inability to protect persons from the AUC. The Respondent submits the Applicants have not shown that they specifically directed the panel to this evidence and the panel cannot be faulted for not considering evidence the importance of which was not highlighted
.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Respondent also submits that the Applicants' argument presumes that the onus and burden of the sate protection is reversed. It is not for the RPD to be satisfied that state protection exists, but rather for the Applicants to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection with clear and cogent evidence demonstrating that adequate protection is not available to them.
[28]
The appropriate standard of review for determinations of state protection is reasonableness. The RPD's finding of adequate state protection should not be interfered with unless it can be demonstrated that the RPD based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.
Federal Courts Act
, RSC, 1985, c F-7, s 18.1(4)(d).
[29]
There is a presumption that state protection exists and the burden is on the Applicant to adduce clear and convincing evidence to rebut this presumption. The jurisprudence of this Court is clear that absent a situation of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, there is a presumption that a state is able to protect its citizens.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 38.
[30]
It is also evident from a review of the jurisprudence on state protection that a state's ability to protect its citizens need not be perfect.
Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 18 Imm LR (2d) 130 at para 7.
[31]
In this case, the evidence is clear that the Applicants never sought the protection of the Colombian state. The question is therefore whether the Applicants provided evidence that no adequate state protection would be available if they returned to Colombia.
[32]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Lemieux stated:
It is clear from Ward, above, that the fact a claimant did not approach the state for protection will not automatically defeat a claim. An objective assessment must be undertaken to establish is the state is able to protect effectively. In other words, the test is whether effective state protection may be reasonably forthcoming. What has to be determined, in each case is whether it was objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought the protection. If it was not objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought state protection, she need not have approached the police in St. Vincent. The answer to the question is a matter of the evidence produced on the point.
[33]
The evidence before the RPD is that the AUC told Dr. Strusberg they considered him to be a FARC collaborator and an enemy of the AUC. Although the question of state protection is prospective, the Applicant's status as being targeted and at high risk is a factor the RPD must consider in its analysis.
[34]
The RPD stated:
[26] Robins testified that he did not report any of the threats or extortion demands made by members of the AUC or FARC to police. He also indicated that he spoke with friends, acquaintances and patients who were police officers about his problems but did not want to report it because something bad could happen and they recommended against it. Robins was asked if state protection would be available to him today in Colombia. He testified that he watches the news and everything seems rosy but new emerging criminal gangs known as Bandas Criminales Emergentes (BACRIM) have formed and the director of the domestic intelligence agency (DAS) is accused of crimes. He went on to say that the first process to prosecute the director of DAS was dismissed and they are attempting to re-try him.
[27] Robins' evidence regarding the prosecution of the DAS director demonstrates that Colombia is serious about curbing corruption. Robins' oral testimony regarding the advice he received from friends in the security forces and the news of emerging criminal gangs does not rebut the presumption of state protection existing in Colombia.
[35]
The RPD skirts around Dr. Strusberg's evidence that he was specifically warned by his uncle, a prominent lawyer with access to confidential information, advising Dr. Strusberg that he and his family were in such danger that they must "immediately abandon the country". This was for Dr. Strusberg the strongest evidence that the risk to himself was real and immediate.
[36]
The evidence also included documentation that the Colombian security forces continue to "turn a blind eye" to paramilitary atrocities and continued to collaborate with paramilitary forces. The government response to the violence and human rights violations of the AUC requires examination by the RPD.
[37]
The RPD was not obliged to accept the Applicant's opinion that they could not safely remain in Colombia and obtain official protection but it could not ignore evidence which is at the crux of the Applicants' claim.
[38]
These Applicants did not lightly abandon their country. They moved to Bogota. They then tried leaving Colombia for six months to allow for things to cool off. When they returned to Colombia, violent sexual threats were levelled against Ms. Crespo and their daughter Ashley. Dr. Strusberg continued to return with a determined effort to, as he put it, "get his life back". The RPD is obligated to examine the evidence about events upon which the Applicants based their decision to flee Colombia and seek refugee status.
Conclusion
[39]
I find the RPD did not consider the evidence that Dr. Strusberg was specifically targeted by the AUC nor did it consider evidence concerning the inadequacy of state protection for those who are at risk from paramilitary groups allied with the government. In failing to do so, the RPD erred.
[40]
Neither party proposed a question of general importance for certification.
JUDGMENT
[41]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the RPD is quashed and the matter is referred to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.
2. No question of general importance is certified.
.........................
Robins Strusberg Ramos, Erika Irene Crespo Paez et Ashley Strusberg Crespo représentée par son tuteur à l'instance  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeurs sollicitent le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue par un commissaire de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié le 28 novembre 2011. La SPR a rejeté les demandes d'asile des demandeurs fondées sur l'article 96 et le paragraphe 97(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi). Elle a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni celle de personnes à protéger.
Le contexte
[2]
Les demandeurs, le Dr Robins Strusberg Ramos, son épouse, Mme Erika Irene Crespo Paez, qui est elle aussi médecin, et leurs enfants mineurs, Ashley Strusberg Crespo et Caleb Joshua Strusberg Ramos, demandent l'asile au titre des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi. Les demandeurs sont des citoyens de la Colombie, à l'exception de Caleb, qui est citoyen des États-Unis d'Amérique (les É.-U.).
[3]
Au début de 2005, des membres des Autodéfenses unies de Colombie (les AUC) avaient communiqué avec le Dr Strusberg à la clinique où il travaillait et lui avaient demandé de leur verser de l'argent pour sa protection. Il avait acquiescé et avait versé régulièrement de l'argent aux AUC. Des membres des Forces armées révolutionnaires de Colombie (les FARC) avaient aussi communiqué avec lui au début de l'année 2005 pour lui demander qu'il leur verse, à eux aussi, des montants mensuels.
[4]
En octobre 2007, un dirigeant des AUC avait demandé au Dr Strusberg d'acheter 12 000 doses du médicament Glucantime. Le Dr Strusberg lui a expliqué qu'il ne pouvait pas satisfaire à sa demande, car il s'agissait d'une substance contrôlée. Les AUC lui ont dit qu'ils savaient qu'il avait soigné des membres des FARC, qu'il en avait payé certains et que les AUC le surveillaient, car il était un collaborateur des FARC. À la suite de cette visite, le Dr Strusberg a commencé à recevoir des appels de menaces de la part de membres des AUC. Ils ont continué d'insister pour qu'il leur fournisse le médicament qu'ils voulaient et lui ont aussi demandé un important versement supplémentaire. Le Dr Strusberg a satisfait à leur demande d'argent, mais a continué de recevoir des appels de menaces.
[5]
En décembre 2007, les demandeurs ont quitté la Colombie pour les É.-U. Ils sont retournés en Colombie six mois plus tard en mai 2008. Les appels de menaces ont repris en juin. Des menaces explicites de violence sexuelle avaient été formulées à l'endroit de Mme Crespo et de sa fille, Ashley, ce qui a occasionné une fausse couche à Mme Crespo. Les demandeurs avaient fui aux É.-U. en août 2008 dès que l'état de santé de Mme Crespo l'avait permis. Le Dr Strusberg retournait en Colombie tous les six mois pour renouveler son visa américain, pour qu'il puisse légalement vivre aux É.-U. Caleb est né aux É.-U. le 19 septembre 2009.
[6]
Le Dr Strusberg est retourné en Colombie en mai 2010 pour y présenter une demande de pardon relativement au statut de Mme Crespo aux É.-U. Le 11 juin 2010, il a reçu un appel de menaces de la part des AUC. Son interlocuteur lui a dit qu'il était un ennemi des AUC et qu'il le paierait de sa vie. L'oncle du Dr Strusberg, un avocat bien en vue qui détenait des renseignements provenant de sources confidentielles, l'a avisé que sa vie était en danger. Le Dr Strusberg a fui la Colombie vers les É.-U. le 6 juillet 2010.
[7]
Le Dr Strusberg est entré au Canada le 21 août 2010 et a présenté une demande d'asile le 31 août 2010. Mme Crespo et Caleb, leur enfant, l'ont rejoint le 14 septembre 2010. Leur autre enfant, Ashley, est entrée au Canada le 15 septembre 2010. Leurs demandes d'asile, qui avaient été présentées au moment de leur arrivée respective, ont toutes été jointes.
La décision faisant l'objet du contrôle judiciaire
[8]
La SPR avait des doutes quant à la crainte subjective des demandeurs, puisqu'ils n'avaient pas demandé l'asile à la première occasion qu'ils avaient de ce faire aux États-Unis ainsi qu'en raison du fait qu'ils s'étaient de nouveau réclamés de la protection de la Colombie.
[9]
La SPR a aussi statué que les demandeurs n'avaient pas réfuté la présomption de protection adéquate de l'État. La SPR a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas démontré qu'ils ne pouvaient obtenir une protection de l'État adéquate en Colombie.
Les questions en litige
[10]
Les questions en litige dans la présente affaire sont les suivantes:
1. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur de droit lorsqu'elle a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas de crainte subjective d'être persécutés en Colombie, parce qu'ils auraient pu et auraient dû demander l'asile aux É.-U. et qu'ils s'étaient de nouveau réclamés de la protection de la Colombie?
2. L'analyse de la SPR quant à la protection de l'État en Colombie était-elle déraisonnable?
La norme de contrôle applicable
[11]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu qu'il n'y avait que deux normes de contrôle: la norme de la décision correcte, en ce qui a trait aux questions de droit, et la norme de la raisonnabilité, en ce qui concerne les questions mixtes de fait et de droit ainsi que les questions de fait ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 50 et 53). La Cour suprême du Canada a aussi jugé que, lorsque la norme de contrôle a déjà été arrêtée, il n'est pas nécessaire de reprendre l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle applicable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 62).
[12]
La norme de la raisonnablité s'applique à l'égard des conclusions relatives aux questions de savoir si un demandeur a établi une crainte subjective de persécution et si une personne a besoin d'être protégée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[13]
Les questions relatives au caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État sont« des questions mixtes de fait et de droit habituellement susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 413, au paragraphe 38 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
Analyse
L'appréciation de la crainte subjective
[14]
La SPR a déclaré que les demandeurs d'asile authentiques sont censés demander la protection dès qu'il est pratique de le faire et qu'ils se trouvent hors de portée de leurs oppresseurs. La SPR a rejeté l'explication donnée par les demandeurs adultes pour expliquer leur omission à présenter des demandes d'asile aux É.-U. La SPR a seulement mis l'accent sur l'explication des demandeurs quant à la raison pour laquelle ils n'avaient pas présenté de demandes d'asile aux É.-U.: deux avocats avaient avisé les demandeurs que leurs demandes allaient être rejetées, parce qu'ils avaient donné de l'argent à des terroristes pour assurer leur protection.
[15]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que la SPR a commis une erreur en omettant d'examiner d'autres éléments de preuve importants. Je souscris à cette prétention. Selon la preuve dont était saisie la SPR, une fois que Mme Crespo avait décidé qu'elle ne retournerait pas en Colombie après les menaces qui lui avaient été proférées en mai 2008, elle a tenté de régulariser son statut aux É.-U. par l'entremise du parrainage de sa mère, qui était une citoyenne américaine. Cette méthode a échoué, parce que Mme Crespo devait d'abord retourner en Colombie pour régulariser son statut, ce qu'elle n'était pas disposée à faire. Le Dr Strusberg a continué d'aller en Colombie jusqu'à ce que son oncle lui ait mentionné que sa vie était en danger et qu'il ait fui définitivement la Colombie.
[16]
Il fait aucun doute que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte des efforts de Mme Crespo pour régulariser son statut aux É.-U, puisqu'elle a énoncé ce qui suit: « Je suis convaincu que, si Robins et Erika craignaient véritablement de retourner en Colombie,
ils auraient fait d'autres tentatives en vue de régulariser leur statut aux É.-U.
» [Non souligné dans l'original.] Sur ce point, je suis convaincu que la SPR a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte du fait que Mme Crespo avait effectivement fait des efforts supplémentaires pour régulariser son statut aux É.-U.
[17]
Les demandeurs soutiennent aussi que la SPR n'a pas compris la preuve portant sur leur conduite lorsqu'ils s'étaient de nouveau réclamés de la protection de l'État. Les demandeurs prétendent que, la première fois qu'ils étaient retournés en Colombie en tant que famille, ils avaient pour but d'y revenir faire leur vie. Lorsqu'elles avaient fui la Colombie en août 2008, en raison de la reprise des appels de menaces, Mme Crespo et sa fille Ashley n'y sont jamais retournées. Le Dr Strusberg est retourné en Colombie parce qu'il voulait reprendre sa vie en Colombie et il a essayé de régler le problème. Il a finalement lâché prise lorsqu'on l'a averti que sa vie était en danger.
[18]
Le défendeur soutient que la SPR s'est penchée sur les tentatives des demandeurs d'obtenir un statut aux É.-U. Cependant, de tels visas temporaires ne sauraient remplacer le statut permanent que leur conférerait l'asile. Le défendeur prétend que la SPR a saisi pourquoi les demandeurs étaient retournés en Colombie - leurs statuts de visiteurs aux É.-U. étaient expirés et leur demande de résidence permanente à titre de membres de la catégorie du regroupement familial avait été rejetée. Cependant, le défendeur soutient que les demandeurs sont retournés de leur propre chef en Colombie, au moment de l'expiration de leur statut aux É.-U. Ils y sont retournés à de multiples reprises et, à chaque occasion, pendant des périodes prolongées. Le défendeur soutient qu'il était raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que les demandeurs, de par leur habitude à retourner en Colombie, se réclamaient de nouveau de la protection de cet État
.
[19]
La SPR s'est fondée sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), qui « laisse entendre qu'une conclusion défavorable peut être tirée dans les cas où le demandeur d'asile séjourne hors du présumé pays de persécution et omet d'en profiter pour demander l'asile ailleurs, puis qu'il se réclame à nouveau de la protection de son pays ».La SPR a conclu que les actions des demandeurs ne correspondaient pas à une crainte subjective de persécution.
[20]
La SPR n'a pas offert de motifs quant à savoir pourquoi elle n'acceptait pas les explications des demandeurs. L'explication de la SPR amalgame le seul retour de Mme Crespo avec les nombreux retours du Dr Strusberg et ne se penche pas sur l'élément décisif pour chacun des demandeurs, soit le moment où chacun d'entre eux a réalisé qu'il était impossible de retourner en Colombie sans être exposé à la persécution.
[21]
La SPR a tiré ses inférences défavorables en s'appuyant sur l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , sans tenir compte du fait que la situation des demandeurs dans la présente affaire était différente de celle des demandeurs dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Je conclus que la SPR a, ce faisant, commis une erreur.
La protection de l'État
[22]
La SPR a conclu que les demandeurs, dans les circonstances de la présente affaire, n'avaient pas réussi à réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État au moyen d'une preuve claire et convaincante.
[23]
Les demandeurs prétendent que l'analyse de la protection de l'État effectuée par la SPR était totalement inadéquate, puisqu'elle a essentiellement produit un ensemble de motifs « passe-partout », dans lequel elle s'en est tenue à des généralités à propos des mesures mises en place par l'État colombien.
[24]
Les demandeurs soutiennent aussi que la SPR a omis de tenir compte de plusieurs facteurs cruciaux. Ils prétendent qu'ils ont non seulement été pris pour cible de manière systématique par les AUC pendant plusieurs années, mais aussi que ce groupe a démontré sa capacité à localiser le Dr Strusberg. Les demandeurs soutiennent que la SPR n'a pas tenté de procéder à une analyse quant à la disponibilité de la protection de l'État, comme elle aurait dû le faire, à la lumière du contexte factuel dans lequel s'inscrivait le risque auquel les demandeurs s'exposaient du fait qu'ils étaient pris pour cible par les AUC.
[25]
Le défendeur soutient que l'analyse de la protection de l'État effectuée par la SPR n'était pas une analyse passe-partout. Le défendeur souligne que la SPR avait le droit d'exposer les principes généraux applicables, ainsi que d'examiner la preuve documentaire relative à la protection disponible en Colombie. Le défendeur soutient que l'examen minutieux effectué par la SPR quant à ces deux éléments fait ressortir l'attention dont elle a fait preuve lorsqu'elle s'est penchée sur la question de la protection de l'État.
[26]
Le défendeur relève que la Cour suprême du Canada a récemment fait remarquer que des motifs ne sont pas inadéquats du fait qu'ils ne font pas référence à chacun des éléments de preuve (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[27]
Le défendeur soutient que la SPR n'a pas omis de tenir compte des éléments de preuve relatifs à l'incapacité des autorités colombiennes à protéger les personnes contre les AUC. Le défendeur soutient que les demandeurs n'ont pas démontré qu'ils avaient précisément attiré l'attention du tribunal sur cette preuve et que l'on ne peut blâmer le tribunal de ne pas avoir tenu compte d'éléments de preuve dont l'importance n'avait pas été soulignée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 8). Le défendeur soutient aussi que l'argument des demandeurs suppose qu'il y a renversement du fardeau de preuve quant à la protection de l'État. Ce n'est pas à la SPR d'être convaincue de l'existence de la protection de l'État; il appartient plutôt aux demandeurs de réfuter la présomption selon laquelle l'État offre une protection adéquate, au moyen d'une preuve claire et convaincante démontrant qu'ils ne peuvent se réclamer d'une protection adéquate.
[28]
La norme de contrôle applicable aux décisions relatives à la protection de l'État est la raisonnabilité. La Cour ne devrait pas modifier la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la protection de l'État était adéquate, à moins qu'il ne soit démontré que la décision ou l'ordonnance de la SPR était fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont elle disposait. (
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC 1985, c F-7, alinéa 18.1(4)
d
).
[29]
Il existe une présomption d'existence de la protection de l'État, et il incombe au demandeur de produire une preuve claire et convaincante pour réfuter cette présomption. La jurisprudence de la Cour établit clairement qu'en absence d'un effondrement complet de l'appareil étatique, il y a lieu de présumer qu'un État est en mesure de protéger ses citoyens (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Pour réfuter cette présomption, un demandeur doit produire une preuve claire et convaincante de l'insuffisance ou de l'inexistence de la protection de l'État (
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 38).

Il ressort aussi manifestement de la jurisprudence sur la protection de l'État que la capacité d'un État de protéger ses citoyens n'a pas à être parfaite (
Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 18 Imm LR (2d) 130, au paragraphe 7).
[31]
En l'espèce, la preuve démontre clairement que les demandeurs n'ont jamais sollicité la protection de l'État en Colombie. La question est donc de savoir si les demandeurs ont fourni une preuve selon laquelle ils ne pourraient obtenir une protection adéquate de l'État dans l'éventualité où ils devaient retourner en Colombie.
[32]
Le juge Lemieux a énoncé ce qui suit dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :

Il ressort clairement de l'arrêt
Ward
, précité, que le fait qu'un demandeur d'asile n'ait pas fait de démarches en vue d'obtenir la protection de l'État n'entraînera pas automatiquement le rejet de la demande d'asile. Un examen objectif doit être entrepris pour établir si l'État est capable d'offrir une protection effective. En d'autres mots, le critère est de savoir si une protection effective peut être raisonnablement assurée. Il faut donc, et ce, dans chaque affaire, trancher la question de savoir s'il était objectivement déraisonnable pour le demandeur d'asile de ne pas avoir sollicité la protection de l'État. S'il n'était pas objectivement déraisonnable pour la demanderesse de ne pas avoir sollicité la protection de l'État, elle n'avait pas à faire de démarches auprès de la police à Saint-Vincent. La réponse à cette question dépend de la preuve produite quant à ce point.
[33]
Selon la preuve dont la SPR était saisie, les AUC avaient dit au Dr Strusberg qu'ils le considéraient comme un collaborateur des FARC et un ennemi des AUC. Bien que la question de la protection de l'État soit de nature prospective, le statut du demandeur, en tant que personne prise pour cible et exposée à un risque élevé, est un facteur dont la SPR devait tenir compte dans son analyse.
[34]
La SPR a énoncé ce qui suit:
[26] Robins a affirmé n'avoir signalé aucune menace ni aucune demande d'extorsion de la part des AUC ou des FARC à la police. Il a aussi expliqué avoir parlé de ses problèmes à des amis, à des connaissances et à des patients qui étaient policiers, mais ne pas avoir voulu porter plainte, car il aurait pu se passer quelque chose de grave et qu'ils lui ont conseillé de ne pas le faire. À la question de savoir si l'État pourrait lui offrir une protection aujourd'hui en Colombie, Robins a répondu qu'il suivait l'actualité et que tout semblait beau, mais que des gangs criminels émergents connus sous le nom de Bandas Criminales Emergentes (BACRIM) se sont formés et que le directeur du service du renseignement intérieur (DAS) est accusé d'avoir commis des crimes. Il a poursuivi en disant que le premier processus de poursuite visant le directeur du DAS avait été rejeté et que des tentatives quant à de nouvelles poursuites sont faites.
[27]
Les éléments de preuve présentés par Robins à propos de la poursuite du directeur du DAS démontrent que la Colombie s'emploie sérieusement à freiner la corruption. Le témoignage qu'a livré Robins de vive voix quant au conseil que certains de ses amis des forces de sécurité lui avaient donné et aux nouveaux gangs criminels émergents ne réfute pas la présomption de la protection de l'État en Colombie.
[35]
La SPR a contourné la preuve présentée par le Dr Strusberg selon laquelle son oncle, un avocat bien en vue ayant accès à des renseignements confidentiels, l'avait précisément averti que lui et sa famille étaient tellement en danger qu'ils devaient [traduction] « immédiatement abandonner le pays ». Il s'agissait, en ce qui concerne le Dr Strusberg, de la preuve la plus solide quant au caractère réel et immédiat du risque auquel il était exposé.
[36]
La preuve comprenait également de la documentation selon laquelle les forces de sécurité de la Colombie continuaient de [traduction] « fermer les yeux » sur les atrocités commises par les forces paramilitaires et de collaborer avec ces dernières. La SPR devait examiner la manière avec laquelle le gouvernement répondait aux violations des droits de la personne et aux actes de violence commis par les AUC.
[37]
La SPR n'était pas obligée de souscrire à l'opinion du demandeur selon laquelle lui et sa famille pouvaient ni rester en Colombie sans être en danger ni obtenir une protection officielle, mais elle ne pouvait omettre de tenir compte de la preuve qui était au cœur de la demande d'asile des demandeurs.
[38]
Les demandeurs dans la présente affaire n'ont pas quitté leur pays à la légère. Ils avaient déménagé à Bogota. Ils avaient ensuite essayé de quitter la Colombie pendant six mois, dans le but de laisser retomber la poussière. À leur retour en Colombie, de violentes menaces de nature sexuelle avaient été proférées à l'endroit de Mme Crespo et de sa fille Ashley. Le Dr Strusberg avait continué d'aller en Colombie, dans un effort résolu, selon ses dires, de [traduction] « reprendre sa vie ». La SPR a l'obligation d'examiner la preuve relative aux incidents sur lesquels les demandeurs fondaient leur décision de fuir la Colombie et de demander l'asile.
Conclusion
[39]
Je conclus que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de la preuve selon laquelle le Dr Strusberg avait personnellement été pris pour cible par les AUC, ni de celle concernant le caractère inadéquat de la protection de l'État offerte aux personnes exposées à un risque provenant des groupes paramilitaires alliés au gouvernement. Ce faisant, la SPR a commis une erreur.
[40]
Les parties n'ont pas proposé de question grave de portée générale à des fins de certification.
