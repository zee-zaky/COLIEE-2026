Overview
[1]
Aronovitch, Prothonotary
: The underlying proceeding is a patent infringement action brought by Safe Gaming Systems Inc. (Safe Gaming) pursuant to the
Patent Act,
RSC 1985, c P-4 (
Patent Act
) in respect of electronic gambling activities carried out by the Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation (NS Gaming), the Atlantic Lottery Corporation (Atlantic Lottery) and Tech Link International Entertainment Limited (Tech Link).
[2]
Before filing their defences to this action, NS Gaming and Atlantic Lottery, (together, the Defendants), have moved to strike the action as against them on the grounds that the Federal Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them as Crown defendants. The Defendants maintain that while the Federal Court has subject matter jurisdiction over patent infringement actions, it does not have personal jurisdictions in actions against them as agents of the Crown in right of the Province of Nova Scotia.
[3]
For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that, read together, section 20 of the
Federal Courts Act,
RSC 1985, c F-7 (
FCA
) and sections 2.1 and 54(2) of the
Patent Act,
confer personal as well as subject matter jurisdiction upon the Federal Court to entertain the present patent infringement action against NS Gaming and Atlantic Lottery.
The Facts
[4]
In the context of a motion to strike, the facts as alleged must be taken as proven. Extraneous evidence may not be adduced in support of a motion to strike brought under Rule 221(1)(a) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106, save where the ground for striking is that the Court lacks jurisdiction in respect of a claim. The following are the salient relevant facts alleged by the plaintiff in its statement of claim.
[5]
Safe Gaming is the owner of Canadian Patent No. 2,331,238, entitled "Safe Gaming System" (238 Patent), which claims a technological solution to proactively prevent problem gambling and to monitor and regulate responsible gaming activities of an individual.
[6]
NS Gaming is a Nova Scotia Crown corporation established in 1995 by the provincial
Gaming Control Act,
1994-95, c 4 (
Gaming Control Act
) for the purpose of carrying out the management function of regulated gaming in Nova Scotia, which includes overseeing the management of the business of gaming in the province. [see footnote 1]
[7]
Atlantic Lottery is incorporated under the
Canada Business Corporations Act,
RSC 1985, c. C-44, and runs the day-to-day operations of many of the various gaming business lines in Atlantic Canada. In Nova Scotia, Atlantic Lottery is contracted by NS Gaming to operate its video and ticket lottery businesses and to act as agent for NS Gaming in carrying out these objectives. The agency agreement between NS Gaming and Atlantic Lottery along with the Order of the Governor in Council approving the agreement are adduced as evidence in support of this motion.
[8]
NS Gaming is a 25 percent shareholder in Atlantic Lottery. Other Atlantic Lottery shareholders include the Queen in Right of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Lotteries Commission of New Brunswick and the Prince Edward Island Lotteries Commission. Atlantic Lottery conducts, manages and operates lottery schemes in four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island.
[9]
Together, the Defendants provide socially responsible gaming products and services to Nova Scotians that incorporate the plaintiff's patented responsible gambling features.
[10]
The plaintiff's seeks a declaration of infringement of the 238 Patent, a permanent injunction, and damages against all three defendants in connection with their unlicensed use of its patented technology. Safe Gaming also seeks a declaration that NS Gaming has failed to comply with Section 19.1 of the
Patent Act
by failing to make efforts to obtain a license to the plaintiff's patent on reasonable commercial terms.
The Grounds for the Motion
[11]
The Defendants rightly point out that the question of whether the Federal Court has jurisdiction over particular subject matter is distinct from whether it has jurisdiction over a particular party:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), wherein the Court held that an action in tort/patent infringement against a provincial Crown agent corporation must be brought in provincial court unless a statute expressly provides for Federal Court jurisdiction "
ratione personae
" over the Crown.
[12]
The Defendants' second argument for striking is that the
Nova Scotia Proceedings Against the
Crown
Act
, RS 1989, c 360 (
NSPAC Act
), requires proceedings against the Crown to be brought in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Thus, as agents of the Crown, any proceedings against them say the Defendants, can only be taken in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. [see footnote 2]
[13]
To flesh out the Defendants' argument, the
Gaming Control Act
provides that NS Gaming is an agent of Her Majesty in right of the Province of Nova Scotia. The statute further provides that the
NSPAC Act
applies to actions and proceedings against NS Gaming, and that any reference to the "Crown" in the
NSPAC Act
is to be construed as a reference to NS Gaming. [see footnote 3]
[14]
The Defendants maintain that a reference to the "Crown" in a statute extends to Crown agents. [see footnote 4] Therefore, by virtue of the agency agreement, and as an agent of the Nova Scotia Crown, the Defendants say that the
NSPAC Act
also applies to Atlantic Lottery and compels any suit against Atlantic Lottery to be brought in the Supreme Court of the province.
The Jurisdiction of this Court
[15]
The Federal Court is a statutory court that requires a statutory grant of power to exercise jurisdiction. The elements required to support a finding of jurisdiction in the Federal Court are set out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 766 (
ITO
) as follows: 1) there is a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament; 2) there is an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction; 3) the law on which the case is based must be "a law of Canada" as the phrase is used in section 101 of the
Constitution Act
, 1867.
[16]
The
FCA
and the
Patent Act,
together, give subject matter jurisdiction to the Court for remedies claimed in respect of patents. Under section 20(1) of the
FCA
, this Court has exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases of patent impeachment and annulment. The Court also has concurrent jurisdiction under section 20(2) of the
FCA
in all other cases, for example patented infringement actions, "
in which a remedy is sought under the authority of any Act of Parliament respecting any patent
."
[17]
The moving parties rest their case primarily upon
Dableh,
wherein Justice Dubé struck out a patent infringement action against New Brunswick Power and Hydro Quebec, in part, on the basis that provincial legislation stipulated that actions against them could only be brought in their respective provincial courts. In that case, the Court was called upon to consider the immunity from liability in tort which the Crown enjoys except as abrogated by statute. The Court noted that the
Patent Act
did not expressly provide that it was binding on the Crown, and in the absence of express language in the
Patent Act
to bind the Crown, Justice Dubé concluded that the concurrent subject matter jurisdiction, between subject and subject, over patent infringement under section 20 of the
FCA,
was not sufficient to bind the provincial Crowns and their agents at issue in that case.
[18]
Justice Dubé wrote the following regarding the absence of any provisions in the
Patent Act
that could bind the Crown:
La
Loi sur les brevets
, S.C.R. 1985, c. P-14, ne fait aucune mention de possibilité de recours devant la cour fédérale du Canada dans le cas de contrefaçon d'un brevet par la Couronne du chef d'une province. On ne retrouve pas non plus dans ce texte de loi une implication nécessaire liant la Couronne provinciale ...
(at page 551)
[19]
The law has changed since Justice Dubé's decision. Section 2.1 of the
Patent Act
was amended in 1993 and now states, "
The Act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province
."
[20]
Further, while section 54 of the
Patent Act
gives concurrent jurisdiction to the provincial courts in matters of patent infringement, section 54(2) of the
Patent Act
provides that "
Nothing ...impairs the jurisdiction of the Federal Court under section 20 of the Federal Courts Act
..."
[21]
Other than in areas such as patent expungement where it has exclusive jurisdiction, section 20(2) of the
FCA
, gives this Court concurrent jurisdiction in all other cases in which a remedy is sought under the authority of any Act of Parliament respecting any patent. The
Patent Act
is such an Act of Parliament which now extends patent remedies as against Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province. The remedies that are available under the
Patent Act
against the provincial Crown are therefore enforceable in this Court.
[22]
The above provisions of the
FCA
and the
Patent Act,
read together, thus provide an explicit statutory grant of jurisdiction by Parliament, to the Federal Court, over patent remedies that may be sought against the Crown, sufficient, in my view, to satisfy the elements of the
ITO
test necessary to find jurisdiction in this Court.
[23]
As for the provincial legislation, and the
NSPAC Act
in particular, the statute only permits actions in tort against the provincial Crown that are brought pursuant to its provisions. Section 91 of the
Constitution Act
, 1867, gives the Federal Parliament exclusive jurisdiction over patents. The provincial legislation does not have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction given by Parliament to the Federal Court in respect of patent actions, or of preventing Parliament from creating a statutory cause of action and attributing jurisdiction in respect of the cause of action to the Federal Court concurrently with the province.
[24]
Indeed, within constitutional limits, Parliament may derogate from the jurisdiction of the provincial courts by conferring jurisdiction upon federal courts constituted by statute pursuant to section 101 of the
Constitution Act
, 1867, "for the better administration of the laws of Canada." Express statutory language must be used where jurisdiction is intended to be assigned to the Federal Court. [see footnote 5] That is the case in this instance.
[25]
I would add that the Defendants' reading of the
FCA
and
Patent Act
to preclude the jurisdiction of this Court in respect of remedies for patent infringement as against the Crown would result in a multiplicity of proceedings that Parliament would not have intended. The Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction as relates to the expungement of patents. Thus, should the Defendants wish to defend against the action by attacking the validity of the plaintiff's patent, they would only be able to do so in this Court. As the plaintiff rightly points out, such a scheme would not ensure the best attainment of the objects of section 20 of the
FCA,
and of the
Patent Act,
in accordance with the interpretive principle set out in section 12 of the
Interpretation Act
, RSC 1985, c I-21. [see footnote 6]
Conclusion
[26]
Coupled with the statutory grant of Federal Court jurisdiction in all cases involving remedies under the
Patent Act
, section 2.1, in my view, removes any doubt that the Federal Court has concurrent jurisdiction in cases seeking a remedy under the
Patent Act
against a provincial Crown. If I am wrong, the motion would fail in any event, as the Defendants have failed to meet their heavy burden in this motion of satisfying the Court that it is "plain and obvious", or free from doubt, that the Federal Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this action as against the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 4.
[27]
While my above findings are dispositive of the matter I would add that if the
NSPAC Act
were to apply to exclude a suit against the provincial Crown in this Court, it is not clear, or free of doubt, that Atlantic Lottery may be said to be the Crown for the purposes of that statute and thus immune from suit in this Court.
