Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.
[1]
O'Reilly, J.
: Blerina Resulaj has been ordered to leave Canada for Albania on October 17, 2003. She has filed an application for leave to judicially review a decision of an immigration officer who conducted a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). He concluded that she would not be at personal risk if returned to Albania. She asks the Court to stay her removal while she pursues her legal remedies in Canada.
[2]
I have concluded that Ms. Resulaj has satisfied the three-part test for a stay.
I. Serious Issue
[3]
Ms. Resulaj argues that the PRRA officer failed to take adequate account of the evidence before him. That evidence was in two forms. First, Ms. Resulaj supplied a written narrative and other documentation outlining the basis for her fear of her ex-husband, who was heavily involved in crime, had abused and assaulted her in the past and had an ongoing dispute with her family over a debt. She alleged, among other things, that her ex-husband had murdered her cousin. Second, the officer considered reports on the conditions in Albania, which included descriptions of the plight of women in that country.
[4]
Looking at the officer's reasons as a whole, I am satisfied that Ms. Resulaj has raised a serious issue; namely, whether the PRRA officer's conclusion that she did not satisfy any of the grounds for protection was supported by the evidence.
II. Irreparable Harm
[5]
This case involves the question whether the assessment of personal risk to Ms. Resulaj was adequate. Removing her to face that potential risk while the legal issue in her case is explored before the Court would render nugatory any legal remedy that might ultimately be available to her. Such circumstances constitute irreparable harm:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (T.D.).
III. Balance of Convenience
[6]
In light of the above, the balance of convenience lies in allowing Ms. Resulaj to remain in Canada while pursuing her legal remedies.
ORDER
[7]
THIS COURT ORDERS that:
1. The removal of the applicant from Canada is stayed until her underlying application for leave and judicial review is finally disposed of.
