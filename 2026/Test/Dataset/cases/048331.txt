Strayer, J.
: This is an application for certiorari to quash the decision of the Deputy Commissioner of Corrections for the Pacific Region, dated January 26, 1988, transferring the applicant from Kent Institution to Saskatchewan Penitentiary. Kent Institution is a maximum security institution and Saskatchewan Penitentiary is a high maximum security institution.
[2]
The applicant complains that he was denied fairness as he was not given sufficient information as to the reasons being considered for the transfer and that he was unable to reply adequately to those allegations before the decision was taken to transfer him. It is also alleged that the Deputy Commissioner acted in excess of jurisdiction by not having regard to relevant considerations. This latter ground was not argued and I believe it is without substance.
[3]
The applicant is serving a life sentence for first degree murder. It is common ground that on January 20, 1988, while he was being held at the Kent Institution, he was notified of a recommendation by the Warden for his involuntary transfer to a high maximum security institution. It is common ground that attached to that recommendation was a one-page statement, "Annex A", setting out six reasons for the recommendation. It is clear from the documents that he also acknowledged receipt that day of a "Notification of Related Transfer Documents". In that Notification there is reference to a "Progress Summary" dated the previous day, January 19th. The "Progress Summary" is a detailed document of some six pages. There is no agreement between counsel as to whether Camphaug received that document on January 20th as well. His signature acknowledging receipt appears at the end of it and the date of receipt appears to be January 20th but it is not entirely clear.
[4]
On January 22, 1988, the applicant submitted a five-page statement in his own writing replying to the notification of the Warden's recommendation for his involuntary transfer. That same day an internal board within the penitentiary confirmed the recommendation of the Warden for his transfer. On January 26, 1988, the Deputy Commissioner for the Pacific Region considered the various documents including the Progress Summary and Camphaug's submissions, and concluded that Camphaug should be transferred to the Saskatchewan penitentiary. This was communicated to Camphaug on January 29, 1988.
[5]
It is established by the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of such decisions to transfer inmates to a higher security prison. This arises both under common law requirements of fairness and under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which requires that such decisions be taken in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. I respectfully accept the way in which the requirement was described by Marceau, J.A., in the Trono case [see footnote 2]. He said that what is involved is the audi alteram partem principle. This principle requires some participation of the person in respect of whose rights or interests the decision is being taken, such participation allowing him to bring forth information that can help the decision-maker to reach a fair and prudent conclusion. The content of the fairness requirement will be the same whether it is ascribed to the common law or to the Charter. I also respectfully accept the view of Marceau, J.A., in the same case [see footnote 3] that a decision to transfer is not like a conviction for an offence: what is required on the part of the decision-maker is a reasonable belief that the prisoner should be moved for the sake of the orderly and proper administration of the institution. This implies that fairness in the making of such a decision does not require that the inmate be given all of the particulars of all alleged wrongdoings; it is sufficient if he can make representations to demonstrate that the recommendation that he be moved is an unreasonable one.
[6]
In the present case, I am satisfied that the inmate has had sufficient opportunity to make such representations. First, it appears to me from the internal evidence that he did have the Progress Summary available to him when he drafted his submissions on January 22. For example, in paragraph (3) of the submissions he refers to "the notification written by L.U. O'Hara". Presumably this is a reference to a Living Unit Officer named O'Hara. The progress summary is signed by "B.D. O'Hara" and I do not see that officer's signature on any other document in question. Certainly, in the same paragraph of his submission, he complains of a report under consideration which is "filled with all my past crimes and offences" and I can see no document, among those before the Deputy Commissioner, other than the Progress Summary, which referred to his "past crimes and offences". At paragraph (7) of his submissions he appears to be responding to a complaint that he refused to meet with staff. There is no such complaint against him in any of the material except the Progress Summary. Also in his submissions he complains that incidents favourable to him were not recounted whereas those unfavourable were. The only document in which there is a substantial reference to incidents is the Progress Summary.
[7]
It should also be noted that in his submissions themselves, Camphaug did not complain about having inadequate information as to the allegations against him. He did not even respond to some allegations and with respect to others he merely disputed the interpretation put on events which of themselves do not appear to be in dispute. In the reasons given to him for the recommendation for his transfer, it was stated that:
"You represent an extreme escape risk as a result of your intimate sexual relationship with a female staff member in that you may have had access to technical, mechanical and security information as well as keys and blueprints ..."
[8]
In his written submission he does not deny this relationship although making reference to the allegation. He confirms in his affidavit in support of this motion the existence of some such relationship but only questions the inferences that the correctional staff have drawn from it with respect to a heightened security risk.
[9]
Having regard to the criteria of fairness in these situations as outlined above, I am satisfied that the applicant had available all of the information made available to the Deputy Commissioner and that it was sufficient that he had 48 hours to submit his written comments. As stated earlier, it was not for the Deputy Commissioner to retry all the allegations against the inmate on the basis of detailed evidence; it was sufficient that he form a reasonable opinion that Camphaug should be moved after Camphaug had an adequate opportunity to comment on that issue.
[10]
The application is therefore dismissed, with costs.
Application dismissed.
