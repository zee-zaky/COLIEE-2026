A. Introduction
[1]
Teitelbaum, J.
[Translation]: The applicant is appealing from a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board on February 25, 1992 that he is not a Convention refugee. The applicant further asked that his case be referred back for hearing before other members of the Refugee Division. He alleged that the tribunal had arrived at a decision vitiated by errors of law, had tribunal, had infringed the rule of fundamental justice and had based its decision on erroneous findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the Board.
B. Facts
[2]
The applicant is a national of Pakistan who is claiming refugee status based on his race, nationality, political opinions and membership in a social group.
[3]
The applicant is a Mohajir, that is a descendant of Muslims who immigrated from India when Pakistan was created in 1947. The Mohajirs are 22% of the population of Pakistan; they have been victims of discrimination and persecution by other groups in Pakistan.
[4]
Before joining the Mohajir Quami Movement (MQM), a political party fighting for the cause of the Mohajirs, in June 1988 the applicant was the victim of a number of incidents and discriminatory attacks because of his ethnic origin. He was driven from university and dismissed from his employment.
[5]
The applicant complained to the police without success; he was even imprisoned several times.
[6]
In August 1989, the applicant became responsible for the MQM unit in his sector of Karachi. Two months later, after ending a cooperation agreement signed with the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) because the latter had not observed it, members of the MQM were the victims of several attacks by PPP members and by the police. The police injured the applicant's wife and arrested and tortured the applicant until he promised to cease his activities in the MQM. The police also threatened members of the MQM with false charges.
[7]
The applicant resigned as the person responsible for his unit but continued to attend MQM meetings.
[8]
In March 1990, the MQM participated in a nonconfidence motion against the PPP government of Benazir Bhutto, but without success.
[9]
After this failure the PPP members increased their violence against MQM members and the Mohajirs. The applicant's business was attacked and destroyed by members of the PPP and the Jeay Sindh.
[10]
In August 1993, the PPP government was dissolved and the Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA), according to the applicant also known
*
as the Jammat-i-Islami (IJI) (sic), took over. The applicant again became active with the MQM. (* French reads "appeler" - TR.)
[11]
In March 1991, the MQM objected to a motion in Parliament tabled by the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, a member of the IJI. IJI members destroyed the applicant's business and made death threats against the applicant.
[12]
The applicant fled to his maternal aunt's home and shortly after decided to leave the country. He departed from Pakistan on March 16, 1991, and arrived in Canada the same day. Two weeks later, on April 2, 1991, after waiting for instructions from the person who assisted the applicant in his flight, he claimed refugee status.
[13]
In August 1991, the members of the IJI came to the home of the applicant's father and requested a large "contribution". The father did not have a lot of money and was then struck, fell and died of a heart attack.
[14]
The applicant considered it was impossible for him to return to Pakistan since he would be harassed by the PPP and could not count on the protection from the government, led by the IJI.
[15]
Since most MQM members are concentrated in a few large cities in Pakistan, the party would be unable to win a sufficient number of seats in Parliament to help the Mohajirs by peaceful and democratic means.
C. Tribunal's Decision
[16]
The tribunal considered that the applicant exaggerated the account of the incidents, but in the absence of any evidence to the contrary the incidents in question were accepted.
[17]
Since the applicant was found credible, the tribunal concluded that the applicant had a genuine subjective fear of persecution. However, after considering the testimony and evidence submitted as a whole the tribunal concluded, in accordance with the tests described in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), that there was no "reasonable chance" that the applicant would be persecuted if he was compelled to return to Pakistan. No objective basis for the fear was established.
[18]
The tribunal cited extracts from the documentary evidence indicating that the opposition between the IDA and PPP and the alliance between the IDA (IJI) and the MQM had "improved the MQM's position in the cities".
[19]
No indication was found by the tribunal that this association had ended and so there was no "reasonable probability" that the applicant would be threatened by the IJI on his return.
[20]
Further, if the applicant was persecuted by other groups he could claim protection from the government because of this association with the IJI.
[21]
The existence of protection from the country's government meant that the applicant did not have a valid fear of persecution for the grounds stated by him.
D. Applicant's Arguments
MQM and Mohajirs: Error Of Fact And
Law
[22]
The two principal grounds in support of the application are that the tribunal (1) based its decision on erroneous findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner without regard to the material before it, and (2) infringed the rules of natural justice.
[23]
The tribunal ignored and minimized the frequency and seriousness of the persecution suffered by the applicant in 1982 when he was at university from PPP members and the police because of his ethnic origin and affiliation with the MQM.
[24]
The complete absence of any reference in the decision to the aforementioned persecutions or the fear resulting from aspects other than those mentioned in the decision amounts to an absence of decision and is an error of law.
[25]
The persecutors feared by the applicant are many and include the PPP and IJI, which are political parties supported by the government.
[26]
Also, the forces of law and order and the government structure consist of Punjabis, Pathans and Sindhis. The latter's attitude has always encouraged persecutions committed against the applicant's community.
[27]
The specific complicity of the government and the authorities against the Mohajirs is confirmed in newspaper articles filed jointly as Exhibit P-2.
[28]
The Karachi newspapers have amply described the false charges laid against members of the MQM and attacks by the police on their houses.
[29]
The applicant's testimony indicated that regardless of the political parties in power, there was never any protection by the police or the authorities.
[30]
The tribunal did not wish to recognize this lack of protection despite the oral and documentary evidence presented at the hearing to this effect.
[31]
The MQM participated in elections at several levels but was never the party in power. On the contrary, party officials were the subject of repressive attacks by the authorities and by members of the PPP and IJI.
[32]
The tribunal limited itself strictly to the literal meaning of the word "opposition" contained in Exhibit A-3 in reference to the PPP and the nonexistence in the documentation of this precise word in relation to the MQM. In actual fact, the MQM is the opposition. Exhibit P-2 filed at the hearing by counsel for the applicant indicated the opposition presented to the party in power by the MQM, and made it clear that the IJI was in league with the PPP against the threat presented by the MQM.
[33]
Exhibit P-2, a family letter dated December 1, 1991, established the persecutions committed by the IJI against the applicant's father and also rebutted the tribunal's conclusion that the MQM is not in opposition to the government.
[34]
The oral and documentary evidence submitted clearly indicated that there is no association between the IJI and the MQM. This is illustrated by the persecutions after January 24, 1991 suffered by the applicant and his family at the hands of the IJI members. This evidence was not rebutted and directly contradicts the tribunal's conclusion.
[35]
The applicant established a general and widespread persecution and the complicity of the government and the authorities, and so a lack of protection by the government and the authorities.
Natural Justice - Bias
[36]
The tribunal acted aggressively towards the applicant. It urged the applicant to answer questions quickly and precisely without allowing him time to present his complete version of the evidence at his own speed.
[37]
Counsel for the applicant was interrupted in the course of his examination-in-chief several times. The tribunal interfered with the evidence, altering the course which the applicant would ordinarily have taken by giving instructions to his counsel, requiring the applicant to give clarifications and abruptly cutting off extremely important details.
[38]
The tribunals rendered a decision vitiated by an error of law by basing its decision solely on past persecution rather than on a fear of future persecution.
[39]
The biased and offensive remarks of the tribunal indicated that it had already reached a decision before the evidence was concluded.
[40]
The tribunal did not take into account positive decisions made in certain cases of Mohajir claimants.
E. Respondent's Arguments
[41]
The respondent argued that in his lengthy submissions the applicant was essentially asking the court to reassess the evidence and to substitute its findings for those of the Refugee Division.
[42]
The respondent argued that the tribunal had considered the evidence as a whole and amply based its conclusion on the evidence.
[43]
The respondent submitted the following in response to the applicant's arguments.
Bias
[44]
The interventions by the tribunal were necessary so as to enable the applicant to explain in detail certain facts in the claim which did not seem clear to it.
[45]
The tribunal gave the applicant an opportunity to present the evidence he wished and took care to determine whether counsel for the applicant had other questions before proceeding to oral submissions. This is apparent from reading the transcript.
[46]
Neither the applicant nor his counsel argued at the hearing that the tribunal had adopted an intimidating attitude and the applicant did not refer to any part of the transcript to support this allegation.
The MQM And The Mojajirs
[47]
It did not appear from the evidence that the Mohajirs and the MQM were oppressed and victims of persecution.
[48]
The discrimination referred to by the applicant in his testimony did not in any way establish that the Mohajirs and MQM members were victims of persecution.
New Evidence
[49]
The applicant's argument contained in the second part of paragraph 20 of the submission and paragraph 147 of the latter's affidavit constitutes evidence that was not in any way presented to the Refugee Division at the hearing.
[50]
The events related by the applicant date from April 10, 1992, while the hearing took place in January 1992. These events have therefore not been proven.
Protection
[51]
The tribunal was right to conclude that in view of the association of the MQM with IDA, the applicant could obtain protection from the country's authorities. This decision is based on documentary evidence, in particular the newspaper extract in Exhibit A-2 which speaks of the association between the MQM and the IDA.
[52]
Further, no evidence was presented that the MQM alliance has ended.
Alliance
[53]
As regards Exhibit P-2, no reference was made to an alliance between IDA and the PPP to persecute the MQM. It referred instead to differences of opinion within the IDA and various manoeuvres between political parties in Pakistan. This interpretation adopted by the tribunal is correct.
Opposition
[54]
The applicant does not describe how the tribunal's decision is in error regarding the MQM being in opposition to the government.
[55]
The tribunal's decision that the PPP is in opposition is correct and supported by Exhibit A-3 (attached to Appendix B of the respondent's file) dated December 30, 1991.
[56]
The applicant has not discharged the burden of showing that the MQM members are regarded as adversaries of the IDA.
Consideration Of Evidence
[57]
The tribunal considered the evidence submitted as a whole and applied the test in accordance with the precedent established by
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  findings, they are neither arbitrary, unreasonable nor perverse.
Judicial Restraint
[59]
The point at issue is one of weighing the evidence. The Refugee Division is a specialized tribunal. The common law recognizes a principle of judicial restraint to the effect that the findings of fact of a trial level tribunal should not be tampered with in the absence of a patent and overriding error which falsified its interpretation of the facts (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 241; 20 W.A.C. 241; 95 D.L.R.(4th) 439).
[60]
Judicial restraint should be applied to conclusions drawn within the field of an agency's specialized knowledge.
[61]
It is not enough to show that another conclusion is possible on the facts, it must be shown that the tribunal's findings of fact are in error and were arrived in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)).
F. Analysis
[62]
A judicial review proceeding is not an opportunity to reassess evidence and substitute the court's findings for those of the Refugee Division. The court's function is instead to examine the tribunal's decision for errors of fact of law or infringements of the rules of natural justice. As MacKay, J., said in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  concerned, is whether the Board erred in law, or whether its conclusions were erroneous findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the Board ... Generally the weight to be given to evidence is a matter for the tribunal's proper discretion. Unless that discretion is
unreasonably exercised
, this court will not intervene." (emphasis added)
[63]
MacKay, J., went to say, regarding the use of evidence and comments on it:
"There is no necessity for the Board to refer in detail to all the evidence before it (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Board is one with recognized expertise, and unless its conclusions of fact
from all the evidence
before it can be said to be capricious or perverse, this court may not intervene." (my emphasis)
[64]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), June 2, 1993, 92-A-7171, Noël, J., describes the court function in a judicial review proceeding:
"... it is not for me to substitute my discretion for that of the Board. The question I must answer is whether it was open to the Board on the evidence to conclude as it did. Recognizing that if confronted with the same evidence, I would have been inclined to hold otherwise, I cannot say that the Board ignored the evidence before it or acted capriciously."
[65]
According to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), there is no need to mention all the evidence submitted for the tribunal's consideration:
"The fact that some of the documentary evidence was not mentioned in the Board's reasons is not fatal to its decision. The passages from the documentary evidence that are relied on by the appellant are part of the total evidence which the Board is entitled to weigh as to reliability and cogency."
[66]
What counts is that based on this evidence the decision made is reasonable.
G. Bias Or Prejudice
[67]
The applicant submitted that the members of the tribunal, Marilyn Hébert and Denyse Raymond, Marilyn Hébert being the president of the said tribunal, acted in a biased manner at the hearing. Counsel for the applicant referred to pp. 10 to 12, 31, 38, 40, 41 and 43 to 45 of the hearing transcript to illustrate the bias or prejudice by the members of the tribunal.
[68]
I have read the passages mentioned above. I would say instead that the members of the tribunal acted aggressively but only in order to obtain answers to their questions. This is demonstrated by pp. 38 and 39 of the hearing transcript.
H. Conclusion
[69]
The evidence on which the tribunal relied in the case at bar is such that its conclusion is reasonable. In my view the documentary evidence submitted does not show that the tribunal based its decision on erroneous findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it. The tribunal also considered a passage which appeared to favour the applicant regarding cooperation between the IDA and PPP against "the threat posed by the Mohajir Quami Movement (MQM)" and submitted reasons why it did not consider that the MQM was in opposition to the government (p. 4 of its decision).
[70]
Although the applicant's arguments in his submission could lead this court to conclude otherwise, it is open to the Refugee Division, as a specialized tribunal exercising a discretionary power, to render a decision contrary to the applicant's interest. If that decision is reasonable the court should not intervene.
[71]
The application is dismissed. No counsel submitted a question to be certified for appeal.
Application dismissed.
