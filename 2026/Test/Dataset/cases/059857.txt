Teitelbaum, J.
: This is an application made on behalf of the plaintiffs for an order for the following:
"That the statement of claim be extended to three months from the date of the application herein to effect service on the owners of the vessel 'Sammi Herald', the defendant, Hightworth Shipping Ltd."
[2]
The grounds for the said motion, as stated in the notice of motion are:
"The grounds of the motion are that it is believed that the defendant has not been within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court since the statement of claim has been filed and an extension of time is required to give effect to a letter of undertaking provided by the vessel 'Sammi Herald' 's P & I Club."
[3]
The statement of claim named Pan Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd. as the charterers of the Vessel "Sammi Herald" and Hightworth Shipping Ltd. (Hightworth) as owners of the vessel "Sammi Herald".
[4]
The statement of claim was amended on November 9, 1990, to name the defendants, Fraser Surrey Docks Limited, Transtec Canada Limited and Johnston Terminals Limited.
[5]
For the reasons found in the affidavit of A. Barry Oland, the statement of claim was never served on the defendant Hightworth and the time for serving the statement of claim on Hightworth has expired. Hightworth was the owner of the vessel "Sammi Herald" when the action was commenced. The vessel is now owned by Pan Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd., a named defendant herein as the charterers of the Vessel "Sammi Herald".
[6]
Hightworth contests the present application for two reasons, that the plaintiffs do not show a sufficient reason for having failed to serve Hightworth and that Hightworth will suffer a serious prejudice if the application is granted, in that the expiry of the applicable limitation period in which to commence the proceedings as against Hightworth will no longer be a factor.
[7]
The statement of claim commencing the proceedings was filed into the Court Registry on May 30, 1990. Hightworth is a named defendant as the registered owner of the defendant ship "Sammi Herald".
[8]
As can be seen in the amended statement of claim filed November 9, 1990, the statement of claim being amended to add other defendants, the plaintiffs allege that by clean on board bill of lading dated on or about
April 20, 1989
, the defendants except the defendant Fraser Surrey Docks, their servants or agents acknowledged to have received in good order and condition on board the defendant Vessel "Sammi Herald" certain cargo for carriage from Inchon, Korea to Vancouver, B.C.
[9]
Discharge of the Vessel was completed on
June 29, 1989
(Empire Shipping Co. Ltd. Daily Report). The plaintiffs, in paragraph 10 of their amended statement of claim, allege:
"That in breach of the contract of carriage and/or in breach of their duty as bailees for reward and/or negligently the defendants
except the defendants, Fraser Surrey Docks
, their servants or agents did not deliver the goods in good order and condition but delivered them with bending of full length pieces, bent and damaged ends, body wall damage, and scoring
to the defendants, Fraser Surrey Docks at New Westminster, British Columbia with damage hereto
."
[10]
A statement of defence on behalf of Pan Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd. was filed on January 14, 1991. No other defendants filed a statement of defence.
[11]
Pursuant to rule 306 of the
Federal Court Rules
the time for service of the statement of claim expired on
May 30, 1991
- this as a result of the plaintiffs filing their statement of claim on
May 30, 1990
. Where the statement of claim has not been served, "for any sufficient reason" the court may extend the time for service.
"Rule 306. A statement of claim or declaration may be served under rule 304 within 12 months from the day when the statement of claim or declaration was filed; but where, for any sufficient reason, a statement of claim or declaration has not been served within that time, the court may, by order, made either before or after the expiration of such time, extend the time for service for a period not exceeding 12 months at any one time, each of such extensions to be calculated from the date of the order."
[12]
Plaintiffs failed to serve the statement of claim on the defendant Hightworth, the owner of the Vessel "Sammi Herald". The present owner of the vessel is the defendant Pan Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd., the charterer of the vessel at the time of the delivery of the cargo.
[13]
In paragraph 18 of the affidavit of A. Barry Oland, counsel for plaintiffs, he agrees that the time for serving the statement of claim on Hightworth had expired.
[14]
As previously stated, the plaintiffs now ask, pursuant to rule 306 for an extension of time for service of the statement of claim for a period of three months in order to serve the statement of claim on "Hightworth".
The Law
[15]
The law as it relates to the issue of granting extensions of time for service appears to be relatively clear.
[16]
I believe I need not go any further but to quote Mr. Justice Denault in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the case, the only issue to be decided by Mr. Justice Denault is whether or not the plaintiff has shown that there ever existed "at the time of the ex parte or at the present time 'any sufficient reason' to oblige the court to extend the time for service of the statement of claim?" The same issue is before me, with the exception that the issue of an ex-parte order is not in question.
[17]
Mr. Justice Denault states, at page 293:
"Rule 306 provides that a statement of claim may be served within 12 months from the date it was filed. This rule implies that a writ should be served as soon as possible and within the delays fixed by law. In a decision delivered in 1970, under the then existing Admiralty Rule, similar to our present rule 306, President Jackett (as he then was) stated [see footnote 3] that:
'The rules of law contemplate, and the justice of the matter requires, that when an action is commenced, the appropriate papers be communicated to the defendants. The law is designed to put some limit on the length of time it can be allowed to elapse before facing a person with a law suit.'
"In my opinion rule 306 has not changed that principle. On the contrary, that statement of Jackett, P., was endorsed by Teitelbaum, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to serve a statement of claim should be the exception and should not be easily granted'. I agree."
[18]
I, myself, have stated in the case of
Duval Sales Corp. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of Jackett, P., in the case
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  should be served as soon as possible and within the delays fixed by law. Allowing an extension of the delay to serve a statement of claim should be the exception and should not be easily granted."
[19]
In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 1992 (presently in Appeal) in speaking of s. 77(2) of the
Official Languages Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. O-3.01, wherein a delay of 60 days is allowed "or within such further time as the court may ... fix" to commence proceedings, I state, at pages 5 and 6 [of the reasons for judgment]:
"It must be noted, and here I repeat what I have stated, the letter of March 14, 1991, clearly instructs the plaintiff that he has 60 days in which to commence proceedings from the date he receives the letter dated March 14, 1991.
'Veuillez toutefois noter que le délai de soixante jours prévue par la Loi court à partir de la date à laquelle vous recevrez cette lettre.'
"The issue is to decide what meaning is to be ascribed to the words contained in s. 77 of the
Act
. Is the court, for no matter what reason, or for that matter even when no reason is given, to simply extend the delays in which to allow a person to commence proceedings? I think not. What would be the purpose of stipulating a delay in the statute if for any reason or for no reason the court extends the delays in which to commence legal proceedings?
"The court has been given the discretion to extend the delay to commence proceedings but the court can only exercise this discretion in a judicious manner, that is to say, if the plaintiff submits an acceptable reason. I say an acceptable reason to indicate that the court should attempt not to deprive one of a judicial right because of delay but one must have some valid reason for failing to commence legal proceedings within the legal delays stipulated in a statute." [Reported 54 F.T.R. 253.]
[20]
In the case of
Price & Pierce International Inc. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), Mr. Justice Pratte in speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal on the issue of extending the time for the service of a statement of claim, states the following at page 375:
"Rule 306 prescribes that a statement of claim must be served within 12 months and gives the court the power to extend that time 'for any sufficient reason'. Marceau, J., refused to rescind the order extending the time previously pronounced ex parte by Mahoney, J., because he considered that the affidavit filed in support of the application to extend the time disclosed 'sufficient reason for having delayed service of the action'.
"I cannot agree with that conclusion. In my opinion, the material submitted in support of the application for an order extending the time for the service of the statement of claim disclosed no reason for extending the time for service. The only reason that is advanced to explain the failure to serve the statement of claim on the appellant within the 12-month time limit is that the other defendant, Chase International (Holdings) Ltd., experienced serious financial difficulties which led to its bankruptcy. That was not, in my view, a sufficient reason to extend the time. The financial difficulties of Chase International (Holdings) Ltd. in
no way prevented
the respondent from serving the statement of claim on the appellant." (Underlining mine)
[21]
The issue is now to determine if, from the evidence found in the affidavit of A. Barry Oland, the court can find "any sufficient reason" to extend the time to serve the statement of claim in accordance with the principle that to grant such an extension is an exception rather than the rule and that such an extension should not be easily granted. This puts the onus on the applicant to clearly indicate that at least one "sufficient reason" exists, such as, was the plaintiff(s)
prevented
from serving the statement of claim within the stipulated delay.
[22]
In paragraph 4 of his affidavit Mr. Oland states that it is his belief that plaintiffs have a good cause of action against the defendants. In paragraph 5 he states that some 2½ months before filing the statement of claim he contacted the vessel's ("Sammi Herald") local P & I representatives in British Columbia, Shipowners Assurance Management (B.C.) Ltd. and was advised, in writing on March 30, 1990, that a Mr. Deaney of Panobulk America Inc., the North American agents for the defendant Pan Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd. would be handling the claim. Pan Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd., the present owners of the vessel acknowledged receipt of the claim on June 13, 1990. Pan Ocean was served by the fact that their solicitors accepted service. The defendant Hightworth was not served and the reason for same is to be found in paragraphs 13 and 14 of Mr. Oland's affidavit:
"13. As part of the daily practice at our office either myself or my associate, K. Joseph Spears review the daily vessel status reports prepared by Pacific Pilotage Authority. The status report lists the movements of vessels in west coast Canadian waters and is transmitted to our office on a daily basis. To the best of my information and belief the Vessel 'Sammi Herald' has not traded to British Columbia waters since our action was commenced. Therefore, our office was unable to effect service on the defendant ship on the Canadian west coast.
"14. I am informed by K. Joseph Spears and verily believe he has personally consulted the B.C. Chamber of Shipping who advised that the defendant vessel has not been in west coast Canadian waters since May 10, 1990 which was before the filing of our statement of claim."
[23]
I take from this that counsel for plaintiffs were waiting for the vessel to return to Canadian waters to serve the vessel as service could have been made on Hightworth by serving the vessel. This, I believe, is the only reason given as to why service was not effected during the stipulated delays. There is nothing in Mr. Oland's affidavit to indicate that plaintiffs did not know where to serve Hightworth, in fact the opposite is true, or that Hightworth was trying to avoid service. The plaintiffs decided not to attempt to serve Hightworth unless the vessel would return to Canadian waters. I ask what would have happened if the vessel had not returned to Canadian waters for another year? Would plaintiffs really believe they had a "sufficient reason" not to serve the statement of claim for that duration of time?
[24]
With respect, I do not see anything in Mr. Oland's affidavit that indicates a "sufficient reason" for the failure to serve the statement of claim within the stipulated delays found in rule 306. I need not discuss the issue of prescription.
[25]
The applicant is denied. Costs in favour of defendant Hightworth.
Application dismissed.
