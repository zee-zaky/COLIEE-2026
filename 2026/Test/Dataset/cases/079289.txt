INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c. 27 [Act] for judicial review of the decision of an immigration officer [Officer], dated 31 October 2012 [Decision], which refused the application for a permanent resident visa because the Applicant did not meet the requirements to be considered a member of the family class because his father [Sponsor] failed to have the Applicant examined on his application for permanent residence in Canada.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a Chinese citizen born on 17 February 1990, and is the Sponsor's eldest son.
[3]
The Sponsor was granted permanent residence status in Canada on 22 October 2008. During the processing of this application in 2006, the Sponsor chose not to have his three children medically examined. A statutory declaration dated 26 May 2008 says that the Sponsor was aware that in proceeding with his application he would not be able to sponsor his children in the future (Applicant's Record, page 21).
[4]
According to a letter dated 14 February 2012 submitted by the Sponsor's counsel to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) (Applicant's Record, page 16), the Applicant was unable to have his children medically examined because he did not have the proper documentation to support his children's application. He felt the only way he could try to deal with this situation was to obtain permanent residence himself to ensure he could return to Canada once he left, and then return to China to resolve the issues himself.
[5]
The Sponsor applied to sponsor his three children, including the Applicant, under the family class on 16 February 2012, requesting humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) consideration for the applications. The Sponsor claimed that the difficulty he had experienced in getting his children examined was fully documented at the time of the application in 2008, and that at that time the Sponsor had no choice but to file the requested waiver.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[6]
The Decision in this case consists of a letter to the Applicant dated 31 October 2012 [Refusal Letter] and the Officer's Computer Assisted Immigration Processing Systems [CAIPS] Notes to the file [Notes]. In the Refusal Letter the Officer states that the Applicant is not eligible for sponsorship as a member of the family class because his Sponsor failed to have him examined for his application for permanent residence to Canada. Therefore, the Applicant was ineligible for processing. The Officer was not satisfied that sufficient H&C factors were present to overcome the Applicant's inability to meet the norms of selection.
[7]
In the Notes dated 24 October 2012, the Officer noted the Sponsor's hardships in having his children examined at the time of his application for permanent residence in 2008 due to his wife's lack of cooperation. The Officer noted that the Applicant's parents were married at that time, and there was still no evidence that they were divorced. The Officer also noted that the Sponsor was well-informed concerning the consequences of not having his children examined at the time of his application, but he opted to continue with his application regardless. The Sponsor landed in Canada without having his children examined at his own request, and so the Officer did not think that subsection 117(10) of the Regulations applied in this case. The Officer noted that the Sponsor's stated motivation was to proceed with his permanent residence application so that he could return to China and sort matters out, but the Officer did not see a connection between the two and did not think that the Sponsor or his counsel had made clear what the connection was.
[8]
The Officer went on to note that the Applicant's birth certificate said that he was born in Hubei, but another document said he was born in Fujian. The Sponsor said the discrepancy was because the family had falsified one document in an attempt to avoid the one-child policy, but this did not make sense to the Officer since the elder son was the family's first child. There were also discrepancies in the birth dates of the Applicant's younger twin siblings. The Officer doubted the authenticity of the adoption of the female twin, and noted that she has been cared for by the Sponsor's brother and sister-in-law. The Officer suspected the "adoption" may have been to assist a relative, and recommended DNA testing for all three children. Generally, the Officer did not believe there was enough evidence to suggest the familial relationships were genuine.
[9]
As regards the H&C considerations, the Officer reiterated that he was not satisfied as to the
bona fides
of the relationships, but went on to consider different H&C factors. He noted that the Sponsor has been living away from the children since 1999, and there was no evidence that this created any significant hardship. The Applicant was also now over 22 years of age, and thus presumably had less need for support than a younger dependant. There was also no evidence that the Applicant had any financial or emotional needs that required special consideration. To the Officer, the fact that the Sponsor chose to proceed without his children in his own application suggests a personal choice to establish a life in Canada without them. The impetus to stay in Canada was not demonstrated to be to provide better care for his children. The Officer concluded there were insufficient H&C factors to overcome the inadmissibility of the Applicant.
ISSUES
[10]
The Applicant raises the following issue in this application:
1. Did the Officer fetter his discretion by either misconstruing the evidence or by placing undue emphasis on the reasons why the children were no longer members of the family class pursuant to paragraph 117(9)(
d
) of the Regulations?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[11]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[12]
The review of an discretionary decision whether or not to allow H&C factors to overcome exclusion mandated by paragraph 117(9)(
d
) is a matter that is reviewable on a reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Sultana
]). When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."

ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
[15]
The Applicant points out that when the Sponsor's inland application for permanent residence was approved on 29 April 2002, it was solely due to a positive risk assessment. Based on Chapter IP 5 of Citizenship and Immigration Canada's manual
Immigration Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) Grounds
, March 2001, Part 9.3 says that admissibility of overseas dependants is not a relevant consideration. The Applicant says that the record is not clear whether this was addressed.
[16]
Further, the Applicant points out that it is an application pursuant to section 25 of the Act that is required for overcome the strict requirements of paragraph 117(9)(
d
) of the Regulations (
Sultana
, above, at paragraphs 21-22). The circumstances surrounding the failure to have a non-accompanying dependant examined are a relevant consideration in a section 25 application.
[17]
The court discussed the central issue to this application at paragraph 2 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as:
At the center of the decision under review is the inherent conflict between maintaining the unity of the family, including respect for the best interests of an affected child, and the important principle of protecting the immigration system from deception and abuse. As with most cases of this sort the choices available to the responsible decision-maker are difficult and, in some measure, unpalatable ...
[18]
The reasons why a dependant was not examined have to be considered along with other positive H&C factors (
Sultana
, above at paragraphs 30-31;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> & 39;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[19]
Further, a failure to give any consideration to the objectives listed in subsection 3(1)
(d)
of the Act, which is to see that families are reunited in Canada, is also an error (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
In this case, there was no misconduct or deception involved, and the Sponsor made every effort to comply with the requirements to have his children examined. The Applicant submits that it was inappropriate for the Officer to put any negative emphasis on why the children were not examined, and the Officer failed to appreciate that a return to China by the Sponsor in advance of becoming a permanent resident would have jeopardized his ability to sponsor his children.
[21]
The Officer's suggestion that the Sponsor chose to proceed with a life in Canada without his children instead of making every effort to have them examined, or to forego his own application to return to live with them, is not only misconstruing the facts, but constitutes a failure to acknowledge the stated objective that families be reunited in Canada. There is little to no legislative purpose served by barring these children from entering Canada, and the Applicant submits that the Decision is unreasonable.
The Respondent
[22]
The Sponsor concedes that he failed to declare his children upon landing in Canada. Section 117(9)
(d)
of the Regulations excludes from the Family Class any non-accompanying family members who were not examined at the time of the sponsor's initial application for permanent residence. As is clear from the declaration signed by the Sponsor, he was aware of the consequences of not declaring his children, but chose to proceed.
[23]
An H&C application is meant to provide relief from "unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), and is the only way an applicant can avoid the strict application of section 117(9)
(d)
of the Regulations. An officer must consider a variety of factors, many of which have to do with geographical separation of family members (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at paragraph 33). The Officer thoroughly considered these factors, and explained why they were insufficient to grant the application. Further, the Decision was supported by specific evidence of the Sponsor's decision to live in Canada away from his children, and a lack of evidence of financial or emotional support.
[24]
The purpose of an H&C application is to provide flexibility to deal with deserving cases not foreseen by the legislation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 22). The Sponsor may have faced a difficult decision in deciding whether or not to stay in China and have his children examined, but the Officer fully considered all the relevant H&C factors in this case. Although the Applicant disagrees with the Officer's analysis, this is not a reason for allowing this judicial review.
[25]
Furthermore, the Sponsor admits that the Applicant is neither a biological or legally adopted child. The Applicant must fit into one of those two categories to be considered a member of the family class (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at paragraph 26). Therefore, the Officer's conclusion that the Applicant is not a dependant child as required by section 2 of the Regulations is reasonable.
ANALYSIS
[26]
I have heard and considered the applications in IMM-12793-12, IMM-12791-12 and IMM-12794-12. Although I am dealing with three separate applications and three separate individual Applicants (who are all siblings), the facts for each application are identical in all material respects, as are the grounds for review and the legal arguments and authorities advanced on both sides.
[27]
The Applicants put forward a very particular argument in this case to support reviewable error. They say that the Officer, in considering an application pursuant to section 25 of the Act to overcome the children's removal from the family class because they were not examined at the time the Sponsor became a permanent resident, either misconstrued the evidence or placed undue negative emphasis on the reasons why the children were not examined.
[28]
As the Applicants point out, there is no evidence in this case of misconduct or deception on the part of the Sponsor, and he has made every effort over the years to comply with the rules. The only reason that the Applicants were eventually excluded from the Sponsor's permanent resident application in 2008 was because he could not (because of resistance by the Applicants' caregivers in China) persuade his children to obtain and submit their medical examinations, and had to choose between losing his own permanent residence by returning to China or completing his application without the children.
[29]
The Applicants' argument is that the Officer failed to appreciate the realities of the choice the Sponsor had to make in 2008, and placed an undue and unreasonable negative inference on the Sponsor's conduct, and failed to appreciate that what the Sponsor did in 2008 was done to comply with the legislation and to eventually facilitate reunion with the Applicants in Canada.
[30]
What is more, the Applicants say there is no legislative purpose to be served by barring them from the usual opportunity to be sponsored. Recognizing that the application of Regulation 117(9)
(d)
forces the Applicants to seek a remedy under section 25(1) of the Act (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 33), the Applicants say they should not now have to demonstrate unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship, or a higher degree of connectedness to their Sponsor father than would have been the case in 2008, if they had been part of the Sponsor's permanent resident application. In the end, they say they are being asked to satisfy a higher burden of sponsorship for no good reason that supports the purposes of the Act. The Sponsor is now being asked to demonstrate that he has a good relationship with his children (it is admittedly strained) which would not have been required in 2008, and the Sponsor is being punished for the passage of time that was no fault of his. These are compelling arguments.
[31]
On the other side, the Respondent points out that the passage of time has indeed made a significant difference to the relationship between the Applicants and the Sponsor, and even if the omission of the Applicants from the 2008 application was not the fault of the Sponsor, the fact remains that the Applicants' real family connections are now in China. They are now adults and they have had no meaningful contact with the Sponsor, who has made no effort to continue a relationship with them from Canada or to provide financial support, or even to move quickly to sponsor them after acquiring permanent residence in 2008. The passage of time has changed what is now at issue. These are also compelling arguments.
[32]
When I look at the Decisions, I don't think there is much to support the Applicants' argument that the Officer misconstrued the evidence or placed undue negative emphasis on the reasons why the children were not examined in 2008 when the Sponsor had to exclude them from his permanent residence application. The reasons for the Decisions as found in the CAIPS notes read in significant part as follows:
Assessment of H&C considerations: I have examined all evidence on file, submitted by the applicant and weighed the positive and negative H&C considerations. I have considered the following indicators of hardship that might warrant H&C: 1. Impact of current separation 2. Financial, emotional needs of applicant 3. Alternatives and future consequences of separation 4. Depth of relationships, bona fides of dependency. Analysis: Analysis is consistent for all three children in applications F000091315, F000091314 and F000091312. Circumstances have not been indicated to be different. PA appears to be living with siblings and with mother's parents. Appears this has been the case for many years as the SPR first entered Canada in 1999. No statement or evidence has been provided in this or the siblings' applications to indicate this situation has changed. There is insufficient indication that their life separated from the SPR has significant hardship. The apparent family conflict was stated to have been aggravated by the separation of the SPR, however, there is insufficient indication that the PA's life in China is made significantly more difficult as a result of the separation from the SPR. I note that the PA is now over 20, and consequently, though still under the age of 22 for the purposes of R2, could be considered an adult with fewer needs than a dependent of a younger age. There is insufficient information provided that there is substantial hardship that might mean in spite of PA's age, H&C should be considered due to financial and emotional needs of PA and that SPR provides for. PA's age means BIOC review is not required. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that any future separation as a result of the refusal of this application would result in undue hardship or the PA or SPR. A dependency relationship with SPR has not been established. There is insufficient indication of financial or emotional support, or the desire to return to China to live and care for children. The fact that the SPR chose to proceed without his children in his own PR application suggests a personal choice to establish a life in Canada without them, rather than make every effort to have them examined, or forgo his own application to return to live with them. The impetus to stay in Canada has not been demonstrated as to better care for his children, including the PA. I have weighed the positive and negative factors regarding the use of humanitarian and compassionate relief. I am not satisfied that the information on file warrants a positive recommendation for H&C relief for the ineligibility of the PA under R117(9)(d). Application refused.
[33]
The only sentence in all of this assessment which the Applicants appear to take issue with is:
The fact that the SPR chose to proceed without his children in his own PR application suggests a personal choice to establish a life in Canada without them, rather than make every effort to have them examined, and forgo his own application to return to live with them.
[34]
It seems to me that the only portion of this sentence that is possible to question factually is "rather than make every effort to have them examined." If there is a negative inference here, or a misunderstanding about what occurred in 2008, I do not think that when it is placed in the context of the Decision as a whole, the Decision can be said to be based on a misunderstanding of the evidence or an "undue negative emphasis on the reasons why the children were not examined". This is not the kind of situation that arose in
Sultana
, above, where the officer fixated on the failure to disclose and so fettered his discretion under section 25(1). The Officer in this case weighed all of the relevant factors. The reason why the children were not examined is of little significance in a decision that examines many other factors that the Applicants do not question. The main point of the Decisions is that the Applicants are now adults whose lives and family connections are in China. They have had no interaction with the Sponsor over many years. To refuse the application under section 25 may thwart the Applicants desire to now come to Canada, but it can hardly be said, given the facts, that if they do not come it will result in any kind of hardship to them or the Sponsor, let alone a substantial, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
[35]
The Sponsor and the Applicants are not, in my reading of the Decisions, being punished for the passage of time and their observing the rules of Canadian immigration law. The Officer is simply assessing the situation under section 25(1) as it exists in 2012 at the time of the applications.
[36]
In their written submissions, the Applicants say that the Officer "misconstrued the evidence or placed undue negative emphasis on the reasons why the children were not examined." Their principal argument at the oral presentation before me, however, was that the Decision fails to accord with the purposes and considerations for using section 25(1) as a means to alleviate and overcome the strict requirements of Regulation 117(9)
(d)
.
[37]
It seems clear on the facts that the Applicants and the Sponsor have not engaged in any kind of deception or abuse. However, it is equally clear that the Officer took into account the factors set forth in the relevant portions of BP2 as confirmed by the case law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Sultana
, above, at paragraph 23.
[38]
The jurisprudence makes clear that, in some cases, section 25 of the Act can mitigate the harshness of the requirements of the Act, including any harshness resulting from Regulation 117(9)
(d)
. This can involve taking into account why a family member was not declared or was not examined.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 15.
[39]
Even if there was no fault in this case on the part of the Applicants and the Sponsor, and the exclusion of the children in 2008 was beyond the Sponsor's control, it is clear from the Decision that, taking into account all of the factors at play, the real focus of the Decision is that relief under section 25(1) was not warranted because there was no ongoing relationship between the Applicants and the Sponsor, and the Applicants are adults with lives and interactive family connections in China. They now say they would like to come to Canada, but there is no evidence that they require relief from any hardship that might have resulted from the application of Regulation 117(9)
(d)
.
[40]
In my view, the Officer did not fetter his discretion or place undue emphasis, and the Decision was reasonable. The Court cannot intervene.
[41]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[42]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.

[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande, présentée en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, ch 27 (la Loi), visant le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision d'un agent d'immigration (l'agent), datée du 31 octobre 2012 (la décision), par laquelle l'agent a rejeté la demande de visa de résident permanent parce que le demandeur ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences de la catégorie du regroupement familial, parce que son père (le répondant) n'a pas fait examiner le demandeur lorsqu'il a présenté sa propre demande de résidence permanente au Canada.
LE CONTEXTE
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen de la Chine né le 17 février 1990, et il est le fils aîné du répondant.
[3]
Le répondant a obtenu le statut de résident permanent au Canada le 22 octobre 2008. Pendant le traitement de sa demande en 2006, le répondant a choisi de ne pas faire subir d'examen médical à ses trois enfants. Une déclaration solennelle datée du 26 mai 2008 montre que le répondant savait qu'en faisant traiter sa demande ainsi, il lui serait impossible de parrainer ses enfants dans l'avenir (dossier du demandeur, page 21).
[4]
Selon une lettre datée du 14 février 2012 présentée par l'avocat du répondant à Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC) (dossier du demandeur, page 16), le répondant a été incapable de faire subir un examen médical à ses enfants parce qu'il ne possédait pas les documents nécessaires à l'appui de la demande de ses enfants. Il était d'avis que la seule façon dont il pouvait régler la situation était d'obtenir la résidence permanente pour lui-même afin de garantir qu'il puisse revenir au Canada s'il quittait ce pays, puis de retourner en Chine pour régler la situation.
[5]
Le répondant a présenté une demande de parrainage pour ses trois enfants, y compris le demandeur, dans la catégorie du regroupement familial le 16 février 2012, et il a demandé que l'on tienne compte de motifs d'ordre humanitaire pour ces demandes. Le répondant a soutenu que les difficultés auxquelles il a été confronté lorsqu'il a tenté de faire subir un examen médical à ses enfants ont été bien consignées au moment où sa demande a été traitée en 2008, et qu'à cette époque, le répondant n'avait eu d'autre choix que de déposer la renonciation demandée.
LA DÉCISION FAISANT L'OBJET DU PRÉSENT CONTRÔLE
[6]
La décision en l'espèce est constituée d'une lettre envoyée au demandeur et datée du 31 octobre 2012 (la lettre de refus) et des notes du Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration (le STIDI) de l'agent, qui se trouvent au dossier (les notes). Dans la lettre de refus, l'agent déclare que le demandeur n'est pas admissible au parrainage à titre de membre de la catégorie du regroupement familial, parce que son répondant ne lui a pas fait subir d'examen médical lorsqu'il a lui-même présenté sa demande de résidence permanente au Canada. Par conséquent, la demande du demandeur ne pouvait pas être traitée. L'agent n'a pas été convaincu qu'il existait suffisamment de motifs d'ordre humanitaire pour remédier à l'incapacité du demandeur de satisfaire aux normes de sélection.
[7]
Dans les notes datées du 24 octobre 2012, l'agent a noté les difficultés que le répondant avait eues à faire subir des examens médicaux à ses enfants au moment où il a fait traiter sa demande de résidence permanente en 2008, en raison du manque de coopération de son épouse. L'agent a noté que les parents du demandeur étaient mariés à l'époque et qu'il n'y avait à ce jour aucune preuve qu'ils étaient divorcés. L'agent a aussi noté que le répondant avait été bien avisé des conséquences qu'aurait sa décision de ne pas faire examiner ses enfants au moment de sa demande, mais qu'il a choisi de poursuivre sa demande malgré cela. Le répondant a obtenu le droit d'établissement au Canada sans que ses enfants n'aient été examinés, à sa demande, et par conséquent, l'agent n'était pas d'avis que le paragraphe 117(10) du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
(le Règlement) s'appliquait en l'espèce. L'agent a noté que le répondant avait déclaré que sa motivation était de faire traiter sa demande de résidence permanente afin qu'il puisse ensuite retourner en Chine et régler la situation, mais l'agent n'a pas vu de lien entre la demande et le retour en Chine et il n'était pas d'avis que le répondant ou son avocat avait clairement établi de lien.
[8]
L'agent a ensuite noté que le certificat de naissance du demandeur disait qu'il est né à Hubei, mais qu'un autre document déclarait qu'il est né à Fujian. Le répondant a déclaré que la différence provenait du fait que la famille avait falsifié un document afin de tenter de se soustraire à la politique de l'enfant unique, mais cela n'avait aucun sens pour l'agent, puisque le fils aîné était le premier enfant de la famille. Il y avait aussi des différences dans les dates de naissance de la sœur et du frère cadets du demandeur. L'agent a douté de l'authenticité de l'adoption de la jumelle, et il a noté que le frère et la belle-sœur du répondant avaient pris soin d'elle. L'agent soupçonnait que l'« adoption » ait pu servir à aider un parent, et il a recommandé que les trois enfants subissent une analyse d'ADN. En général, l'agent n'a pas cru qu'il existait des preuves suffisantes pour croire que les liens familiaux étaient authentiques.
[9]
En ce qui a trait aux motifs d'ordre humanitaire, l'agent a répété qu'il n'était pas convaincu de l'authenticité des relations, mais il a ensuite examiné différents facteurs d'ordre humanitaire. Il a noté que le répondant était séparé de ses enfants depuis 1999 et que rien ne donnait à penser que cela avait créé des difficultés importantes. Le demandeur avait aussi maintenant plus de 22 ans et, par conséquent, il avait donc censément moins besoin de soutien qu'un enfant à charge mineur. Il n'y avait aussi aucune preuve que le demandeur avait des besoins en matière de soutien financier ou émotif qui nécessitaient un examen spécial. Pour l'agent, le fait que le répondant ait choisi de procéder à sa propre demande sans ses enfants laissait croire que le répondant avait fait le choix personnel d'établir sa vie au Canada sans ses enfants. Il n'a pas été démontré que sa motivation pour rester au Canada visait à offrir une meilleure vie à ses enfants. L'agent a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas suffisamment de motifs d'ordre humanitaire pour remédier à l'inadmissibilité du demandeur.
LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[10]
Le demandeur soulève la question en litige suivante dans la présente demande:
1. L'agent a-t-il entravé son pouvoir discrétionnaire en interprétant mal la preuve ou en donnant une importance indue aux raisons pour lesquelles les enfants ne faisaient plus partie de la catégorie du regroupement familial au sens de l'alinéa 117(9)
d
) du Règlement?
LA NORME DE CONTRÔLE APPLICABLE
[11]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu qu'il n'est pas nécessaire d'effectuer dans chaque cas une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle. Lorsque la jurisprudence établit déjà de manière satisfaisante la norme de contrôle applicable à la question dont elle est saisie, la cour de révision peut l'adopter. C'est seulement lorsque cette recherche s'avère infructueuse que la cour de révision doit entreprendre l'examen des quatre facteurs que comporte l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle.
[12]
L'examen d'une décision discrétionnaire de permettre ou non à des motifs d'ordre humanitaire de remédier à l'exclusion prévue à l'alinéa 117(9)

) est assujetti à la norme de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
Sultana
)). Lorsque la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique, l'analyse tiendra « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».Voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Autrement dit, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la décision est déraisonnable, en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».

LES ARGUMENTS
Le demandeur
[15]
Le demandeur souligne que lorsque la demande de résidence permanente du répondant présentée depuis le Canada a été approuvée le 29 avril 2002, c'était uniquement en raison d'un examen des risques qui s'est avéré positif. La partie 9,3 du guide de Citoyenneté et Immigration, Chapitre IP 5: Demande présentée par des immigrants au Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, mars 2001, précise que l'admissibilité des enfants à charge à l'étranger n'est pas pertinente. Le demandeur soutient qu'il n'est pas clair, en fonction du dossier, si cette question a été tranchée.
[16]
De plus, le demandeur soutient que c'est une demande présentée en application de l'article 25 de la Loi qui est nécessaire pour se soustraire à l'obligation de l'alinéa 117(9)
d
) du Règlement (
Sultana
, précité, aux paragraphes 21 et 22). Les circonstances entourant le défaut de faire examiner des enfants à charge qui n'accompagnent pas le demandeur sont des questions pertinentes pour une demande présentée en application de l'article 25.
[17]
La Cour a abordé la question principale de la demande en l'espèce au paragraphe 2 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Au cœur de la décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle est le conflit inhérent entre le maintien de l'unité de la famille, notamment le respect de l'intérêt supérieur d'un enfant touché par la décision, et l'important principe de la protection du système d'immigration contre la tromperie et l'abus. Comme c'est le cas dans la plupart des affaires de ce genre, les choix qui s'offrent au décideur sont difficiles et, dans une certaine mesure, désagréables...
[18]
Les raisons pour lesquelles un enfant à charge n'a pas fait l'objet d'un examen doivent être examinées avec d'autres motifs positifs d'ordre humanitaire (
Sultana
, précité, aux paragraphes 30 et 31;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 39;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 15).
[19]
De plus, le défaut de tenir compte de l'objectif établi à l'alinéa 3(1)
d
) de la Loi, qui est de veiller à la réunification des familles au Canada, est aussi une erreur (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
En l'espèce, il n'y a eu aucune inconduite ou supercherie, et le répondant a déployé tous les efforts afin de satisfaire aux exigences pour que ses enfants soient examinés. Le demandeur soutient qu'il était inapproprié pour l'agent de donner une importance négative à la raison pour laquelle les enfants n'avaient pas fait l'objet d'un examen et que l'agent a omis d'apprécier le fait que, si le répondant était retourné en Chine avant de devenir résident permanent, il aurait mis en péril sa capacité de parrainer ses enfants.
[21]
La suggestion de l'agent selon laquelle le répondant a choisi de s'établir au Canada sans ses enfants plutôt que de déployer tous les efforts pour que ses enfants soient examinés, ou d'annuler sa propre demande afin de retourner habiter avec ses enfants, n'est pas seulement une mauvaise interprétation des faits, mais constitue un défaut de reconnaître l'objectif établi de veiller à la réunification des familles au Canada. Le fait d'empêcher les enfants d'entrer au Canada n'a peu ou pas d'objectif légal et le demandeur soutient que la décision est déraisonnable.
Le défendeur
[22]
Le répondant reconnaît qu'il n'a pas déclaré ses enfants lorsqu'il est arrivé au Canada. L'alinéa 117(9)
d
) du Règlement exclut de la catégorie du regroupement familial tous les membres de la famille qui n'accompagnent pas le demandeur et qui n'ont pas été examiné au moment de la demande initiale de résidence permanente du répondant. La déclaration signée par le répondant montre clairement qu'il était conscient des conséquences de ne pas déclarer ses enfants, mais qu'il a choisi de poursuivre sa demande.
[23]
Une demande présentée pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire vise à accorder une réparation en cas de « difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), et qu'il s'agit de la seule façon dont un demandeur peut éviter l'application stricte de l'alinéa 117(9)
d
) du Règlement. Un agent doit examiner divers facteurs, dont beaucoup portent sur la séparation géographique des membres de la famille (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 33). L'agent a examiné ces facteurs en détail et a expliqué pourquoi ils étaient insuffisants pour qu'il accorde la demande. De plus, la décision était appuyée par la preuve précise de la décision du répondant d'habiter au Canada, loin de ses enfants, et par un manque de preuve de soutien financier ou émotif.
[24]
L'objectif d'une demande présentée pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire est d'offrir une souplesse afin de traiter les cas fondés dont les circonstances n'ont pas été prévues par la loi ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 22). Le répondant a pu avoir à prendre une décision difficile lorsqu'il a décidé de ne pas rester en Chine et de ne pas faire examiner ses enfants, mais l'agent a examiné en détail tous les facteurs d'ordre humanitaire pertinents en l'espèce. Bien que le demandeur ne soit pas d'accord avec l'agent, il ne s'agit pas d'une raison pour accorder le contrôle judiciaire.
[25]
De plus, le répondant a reconnu que le demandeur n'est ni son enfant biologique, ni son enfant légalement adopté. Le demandeur doit faire partie de l'une de ces deux catégories pour être considéré comme un membre de la catégorie du regroupement familial (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), au paragraphe 26). Par conséquent, la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle le demandeur n'est pas un enfant à charge au sens de l'article 2 du Règlement est raisonnable.
ANALYSE
[26]
J'ai entendu et examiné les demandes dans les dossiers IMM-12793-12, IMM-12791-12 et IMM-12794-12. Bien que je sois saisi de trois demandes distinctes et de trois demandeurs distincts (qui sont frères et sœur), les faits de chaque demande sont identiques pour tous les points importants, comme le sont les motifs de contrôle et les arguments légaux et la jurisprudence que les deux parties ont présentés.
[27]
Les demandeurs ont soulevé un argument particulier en l'espèce à l'appui d'une erreur susceptible de révision. Ils soutiennent que l'agent, en examinant une demande présentée en application de l'article 25 de la Loi pour remédier à l'exclusion des enfants de la catégorie du regroupement familial parce qu'ils n'ont pas subi d'examen au moment où le répondant est devenu résident permanent, a mal apprécié la preuve ou a accordé une importance négative indue aux raisons pour lesquelles les enfants n'ont pas subi d'examen.
[28]
Comme les demandeurs le notent, rien ne donne à penser en l'espèce qu'il y a eu inconduite ou supercherie de la part du répondant, et il a déployé tous les efforts au cours des années pour satisfaire aux règles. La seule raison pour laquelle les demandeurs ont finalement été exclus de la demande de résidence permanente du répondant en 2008 était qui lui avait été impossible (en raison de la résistance des gardiens des demandeurs en Chine) de persuader ses enfants d'obtenir un examen médical et de le présenter aux autorités canadiennes, et il avait dû choisir entre perdre sa propre résidence permanente en retournant en Chine ou terminer sa demande sans ses enfants.
[29]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent n'a pas apprécié les réalités du choix que le répondant avait dû faire en 2008, qu'il a accordé une référence négative indue et déraisonnable au comportement du répondant et qu'il n'a pas reconnu que la décision du répondant en 2008 avait été prise afin de satisfaire aux lois et d'éventuellement faciliter des retrouvailles avec les demandeurs au Canada.
[30]
Qui plus est, les demandeurs soutiennent qu'il n'y a aucun objectif légal qui soit servi en les empêchant de se prévaloir de l'occasion habituelle d'être parrainés. Reconnaissant que l'application de l'alinéa 117(9)
d
) les force à demander un recours au sens du paragraphe 25(1) de la Loi (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 33), les demandeurs soutiennent qu'ils ne devraient pas maintenant avoir à démontrer qu'ils seraient exposés à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives, ou qu'ils ont des liens plus forts avec leur père répondant que ce qui aurait été le cas en 2008, s'ils avaient fait partie de la demande de résidence permanente du répondant. Enfin, ils soutiennent qu'on leur demande de satisfaire à un fardeau plus lourd de parrainage sans qu'il n'y ait de motif valable à l'appui des objectifs de la Loi. On demande maintenant au répondant de démontrer qu'il a une bonne relation avec ses enfants (il est reconnu que leur relation est tendue), ce qu'on ne lui aurait pas demandé en 2008, et le répondant est puni pour le temps qui s'est écoulé alors que ce n'est nullement sa faute. Il s'agit d'arguments convaincants.
[31]
De l'autre côté, le défendeur soutient que le temps qui s'est écoulé a en effet eu une grande incidence sur la relation entre les demandeurs et le répondant, et que même si les demandeurs n'avaient pas été déclarés sur la demande de 2008 n'était pas la faute du répondant, le fait est que les liens familiaux réels des demandeurs sont maintenant en Chine. Ils sont maintenant des adultes et ils n'ont pas eu de contact significatif avec le répondant, qui n'a pas déployé d'efforts pour maintenir une relation avec eux à partir du Canada ou pour fournir un soutien financier, ou même pour agir rapidement afin de les parrainer après qu'il a obtenu sa résidence permanente en 2008. Le temps qui s'est écoulé a changé ce qui est maintenant en litige. Il s'agit là aussi d'arguments convaincants.
[32]
Lorsque j'examine les décisions, je ne crois pas qu'il y ait grand-chose à l'appui de l'argument des demandeurs selon lequel l'agent a mal apprécié la preuve ou qu'il a accordé une importance négative indue aux raisons pour lesquelles les enfants n'ont pas subi d'examen en 2008 lorsque le répondant a dû les exclure de sa demande de résidence permanente. Les motifs de la décision, tels qu'on les trouve dans les notes du STIDI, se lisent en grande partie comme suit:
[traduction] Examen des motifs d'ordre humanitaire: j'ai examiné toute la preuve au dossier, présentée par le demandeur, et j'ai apprécié les motifs positifs et négatifs d'ordre humanitaire. J'ai examiné les éléments de difficulté suivants qui pourraient justifier une exemption pour motifs d'ordre humanitaire: 1. Répercussions de la séparation actuelle. 2. Besoins financiers et émotifs du demandeur. 3. Autres options et conséquences futures de la séparation. 4. Force de la relation, authenticité du lien de dépendance. Analyse: analyse constante pour les trois enfants dans les demandes F000091315, F000091314 et F000091312. Aucune indication que la situation est différente. Le demandeur principal semble habiter avec son frère et sa sœur chez les parents de sa mère. Cela semble être le cas depuis de nombreuses années, depuis que le répondant est arrivé au Canada en 1999. Aucune déclaration ou preuve présentée dans la présente demande ou celles du frère ou de la sœur ne montre que la situation a changé. Pas de preuve suffisante qu'ils ont subi d'importantes difficultés du fait de leur séparation du répondant. Le conflit familial apparent aurait été aggravé par le départ du répondant, cependant, il n'y a pas de preuve suffisante que la vie du demandeur en Chine a été rendue plus difficile en raison de sa séparation du répondant. Je note que le demandeur a maintenant plus de 20 ans et, par conséquent, bien qu'il n'ait pas encore 22 ans au sens du R2, il peut être considéré comme un adulte qui a moins de besoins qu'un enfant à charge en bas âge. Il n'y a pas assez de renseignements permettant d'établir qu'il existe des difficultés importantes qui pourraient signifier que, malgré l'âge du demandeur, des motifs d'ordre humanitaire doivent être considérés en raison des besoins financiers et émotifs du demandeur auxquels le répondant répond. L'âge du demandeur signifie qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de tenir compte de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant. Pas de preuve suffisante montrant qu'une séparation continue en raison du rejet de la demande constituerait des difficultés excessives pour le demandeur ou le répondant. La relation de dépendance avec le répondant n'a pas été établie. Pas suffisamment de preuve de soutien financier ou émotif ou du désir de retourner en Chine pour habiter avec les enfants et en prendre soin. Le fait que le répondant a choisi de procéder à sa propre demande de résidence permanente sans ses enfants donne à penser qu'il a fait le choix personnel d'établir sa vie au Canada sans eux, plutôt que de déployer les efforts nécessaires pour faire examiner les enfants, ou d'annuler sa propre demande pour retourner en Chine habiter avec eux. Il n'a pas été prouvé que sa motivation pour rester au Canada visait à offrir une meilleure vie à ses enfants, y compris le demandeur. J'ai apprécié les facteurs positifs et négatifs au sujet du recours à une exemption pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. Je ne suis pas convaincu que les renseignements au dossier justifient une recommandation positive d'exemption pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire à l'inadmissibilité du demandeur au sens de l'alinéa 117(9)
d
) du Règlement. Demande rejetée.
[33]
Le demandeur ne semble contester qu'une seule phrase de cette analyse
Le fait que le répondant a choisi de procéder à sa propre demande de résidence permanente sans ses enfants donne à penser qu'il a fait le choix personnel d'établir sa vie au Canada sans eux, plutôt que de déployer les efforts nécessaires pour faire examiner les enfants, ou d'annuler sa propre demande pour retourner en Chine habiter avec eux.
[34]
Il me semble que la seule partie de cette phrase qui puisse être contestée en fonction des faits est la suivante: « plutôt que de déployer les efforts nécessaires pour faire examiner les enfants ». S'il y a eu une conclusion défavorable à cet endroit, ou une mauvaise compréhension de ce qui s'est passé en 2008, je ne crois pas que, dans le contexte de la décision entière, il est possible de soutenir que la décision a été fondée sur une mauvaise compréhension de la preuve ou que l'agent a [traduction] « accordé une importance négative indue aux raisons pour lesquelles les enfants n'ont pas subi d'examen ». Il ne s'agit pas du même type de situation que dans la décision
Sultana
, précitée, où l'agent s'en est tenu seulement au défaut de divulguer et a ainsi entravé son pouvoir discrétionnaire prévu au paragraphe 25(1). L'agent en l'espèce a apprécié tous les facteurs pertinents. La raison pour laquelle les enfants n'ont pas subi d'examen a peu d'importance dans une décision qui examine de nombreux autres facteurs, que les demandeurs ne contestent pas. L'élément principal de la décision est que les demandeurs sont maintenant des adultes dont la vie et les liens familiaux sont en Chine. Ils n'ont eu aucune interaction avec le répondant depuis de nombreuses années. Le rejet de la demande présentée en application de l'article 25 peut faire échec au désir des demandeurs de venir au Canada, mais on peut difficilement dire, compte tenu des faits, que le défaut de venir au Canada leur causera des difficultés ou en causera au répondant, et encore moins qu'il s'agirait de difficultés importantes, injustifiées ou excessives.
[35]
Selon mon interprétation des décisions, le répondant et les demandeurs ne sont pas punis pour le temps qui s'est écoulé ni pour le fait qu'ils ont respecté les règles en matière d'immigration au Canada. L'agent a simplement apprécié la situation au sens du paragraphe 25(1) telle qu'elle était en 2012, au moment où les demandes ont été présentées.
[36]
Dans leurs observations écrites, les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent a [traduction] « mal apprécié la preuve ou a accordé une importance négative indue aux raisons pour lesquelles les enfants n'ont pas subi d'examen ». Leur argument principal, lors de leur exposé oral devant moi, était cependant que la décision ne correspondait pas aux objectifs et aux éléments à apprécier pour l'utilisation du paragraphe 25(1) à titre de recours permettant d'atténuer et de surmonter l'application stricte des exigences de l'alinéa 117(9)
d
) du Règlement.
[37]
Compte tenu des faits, il me semble évident que les demandeurs et le répondant n'ont pas eu recours à de la supercherie ou de l'abus. Cependant, il est aussi évident que l'agent a tenu compte des facteurs établis dans les parties pertinentes du Règlement et confirmés par la jurisprudence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et
Sultana
, précitée, au paragraphe 23.
[38]
La jurisprudence établit clairement que, dans certains cas, l'article 25 de la Loi peut atténuer la rigueur des exigences de la Loi, y compris la rigueur découlant de l'alinéa 117(9)
d
). Cela peut comprendre le fait de tenir compte de la raison pour laquelle un membre de la famille n'a pas été déclaré ou examiné.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[39]
Même si aucune faute n'est attribuable en l'espèce aux demandeurs et au répondant, et que l'exclusion des enfants en 2008 était hors du contrôle du répondant, la décision montre clairement que, compte tenu de tous les facteurs, l'agent a conclu que le recours prévu au paragraphe 25(1) n'était pas justifié parce qu'il n'existait pas de relation continue entre les demandeurs et le défendeur, et que les demandeurs étaient maintenant des adultes dont la vie et les liens familiaux interactifs se trouvaient en Chine. Ils disent qu'ils souhaitent maintenant venir au Canada, mais rien ne montre qu'ils avaient besoin d'une exemption en raison des difficultés auxquelles ils auraient pu être exposés du fait de l'application de l'alinéa 117(9)
d
) du Règlement.
[40]
À mon avis, l'agent n'a pas entravé son pouvoir discrétionnaire et la décision était raisonnable. La Cour ne peut intervenir.
[41]
Les avocats des parties conviennent qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier, ce qui est également l'avis de la Cour.
JUGEMENT
[42]

1. La demande est rejetée.
