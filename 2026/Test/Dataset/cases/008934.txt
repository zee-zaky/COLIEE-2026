Cullen, J.
: This is an application for prohibition to prevent Graham Leslie, an adjudicator appointed under s. 242 of the Canada
Labour Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 ("the
Code
"), from proceeding further with hearing the complaint of Earl Bateman that he was unjustly dismissed by the applicant Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC/the Bank). The applicant also seeks an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the preliminary decision of the adjudicator that Mr. Bateman was not employed by the applicant as a "manager" within the meaning of s. 167(3) of the
Code
. In addition, the applicant seeks an interlocutory injunction or in the alternative a stay of proceedings to prohibit the adjudicator from adjudicating Mr. Bateman's unjust dismissal complaint pending a decision from this court.
Background Facts
[2]
Mr. Bateman was employed with the CIBC as manager of the Bank's Vancouver Regional Data Centre ("R.D.C.") until March 12, 1990, when he was dismissed. Mr. Bateman then made a complaint under s. 240(1) of the
Code
that he had been unjustly dismissed by the Bank. An adjudicator was appointed by the Minister of Labour pursuant to s. 242(1) to hear the complaint. At the hearing, the applicant raised a preliminary objection that the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter on the ground that Bateman was a "manager" within the meaning of s. 167(3) of the
Code
. This subsection states that Division XIV of the
Code
, which includes the unjust dismissal provisions, "does not apply in respect of employees who are managers". The adjudicator heard the evidence put forward by the parties on the issue of whether Bateman was a "manager". He issued a written decision on the preliminary objection on March 22, 1991, in which he concluded that Bateman was not a "manager" within the meaning of s. 167(3) and that he had jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The CIBC then brought these proceedings for prohibition and other relief to prevent him from doing so.
Decision Of The Adjudicator
[3]
In his preliminary decision, the adjudicator first reviewed the case law on the question of the meaning of the word "manager", as the term is not defined in the
Code
. After an analysis of several decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal and other adjudicators, the adjudicator concluded that the term "manager" does not include all employees who perform some management functions. Adopting the reasoning of Heald, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the adjudicator held that the word "manager" in s. 167(3) is used in a restrictive sense, and that the traditional distinction made between "managers" and "employees" in the context of a collective bargaining regime cannot be imported wholesale into the determination of whether one is a "manager" within the meaning of s. 167(3). The adjudicator noted Heald, J.'s, observation that the use of the word "manager" in s. 167(3) is in contradistinction to the phrase "managers or superintendents or who exercise management functions" in the immediately preceding s. 167(2), which concerns the application of Division I of the
Code
. From this Heald, J., concluded that the scope of the term "manager" in s. 167(3) was broader than the exercise of management functions, as subsection 167(2) distinguishes "managers" from persons "who exercise management functions" and "superintendents".
[4]
Based on the foregoing, the adjudicator concluded that
"... Parliament deliberately chose to make a distinction between 'managers', 'superintendents' and employees who 'exercise management functions', for the express purpose of making the benefits of Division XIV of the
Code
available to all nonbargaining unit employees except those in the most senior levels of management."
As Bateman clearly exercised some management functions, the adjudicator decided that the issue in the case at hand was to determine whether the applicant was a "superintendent", and therefore eligible for adjudication, or a "manager". After comparing dictionary definitions of the two words, he concluded his analysis as follows:
"When the terms 'manager' and 'manage' are compared with the terms 'superintendent' and 'superintend', there is clearly a considerable degree of overlapping and duplication. Both sets of terms involve the exercise of direction and control over others. Both sets envisage that direction and control being exercised over a substantial entity. It is of great significance in a case such as the one before me, that the term 'superintendent' very clearly encompasses the chief charge, as well as direction and control over a business, institution or works.
"In the search for the distinguishing features, the factor of autonomy appears clearly to be the most significant one, if not the only one of significance. My conclusion is based on the
Oxford English Dictionary's
definition of to 'manage' as meaning to control the course of affairs by one's own action. In order to be held to be a 'manager' rather than a 'superintendent', it is my view that the degree of autonomy exercised by an employee must be, if not absolute, then very considerable. My decision in this case will be based upon that conclusion."
[5]
The adjudicator then reviewed several areas of the relationship between Bateman and the Bank in order to determine if Bateman's position could be considered part of the managerial hierarchy of the CIBC. The areas examined by the adjudicator to determine if Bateman had the authority to act on issues of significance to the CIBC with "independence and autonomy" were, inter alia: (a) the corporate structure of the Bank, (b) power to hire and transfer employees, (c) control over salaries, (d) input into staffing levels, and (e) power to discipline employees.
Corporate Structure:
[6]
The CIBC has a total of 48,500 full and part-time employees. It is divided into four units: the Corporate Bank, the Individual Bank, the Investment Bank and the Administrative Bank, the branch to which Bateman was attached. Each of these units is headed by a President who reports directly to the Bank's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The President of the Administrative Bank, Ian Ronald, has reporting to him eight Vice-Presidents in charge of operational areas such as inspections, corporate communications, human resources, legal services and information systems, which was the division in which Bateman worked. The Information Systems Division is the largest division by far in the Administrative Bank, with 3,100 of the Administrative Bank's 4,400 employees. The division is comprised of eight regional data centres, in which the data processing needs of each region are carried out, such as account statements, cheque clearing, and other transactions.
[7]
Bateman was appointed manager of the Vancouver Regional Data Centre (RDC) in 1987. He had been employed with the CIBC since 1976, and had served as manager of the London RDC since 1979. At the Vancouver RDC, Bateman had 200 employees under his supervision. The RDC operated seven days a week, with an annual operating budget of about $10,000,000 in 1989 and 1990. It is the second largest of the CIBC's RDCs, being approximately one-quarter the size of the main Toronto data centre.
[8]
Before November 1989, Bateman, in his capacity as manager of the Vancouver RDC, reported to Donald Clarke, who served as Assistant General Manager of the Information Systems Division. Mr. Clarke reported to Tom Saar, Senior Vice-President in Charge of Operations, and Mr. Saar reported to George Hare, the Executive Vice-President of the Division. In September 1989, Clarke left CIBC, and his position was abolished and a step in the hierarchy removed. Saar left in November 1989 and was replaced by Wayne Maysuik.
[9]
Based on the foregoing, the adjudicator found that Bateman was the senior representative of CIBC management in Vancouver. He was on the fourth level of the Administrative Bank hierarchy, reporting to Maysuik, Hare, and Ronald at the Bank's Head Office in Toronto.
Power To Hire:
[10]
The adjudicator found that Bateman had "unfettered power to make decisions" with respect to the power to hire, promote and transfer 85% of the 200 RDC employees, representing those employees who were below a certain salary level. With respect to his power to make career decisions for the remaining employees who were paid at a higher level, Bateman was required to make recommendations which were subject to the approval of his immediate supervisor in Toronto, Wayne Maysuik. The adjudicator found that all but one of Bateman's recommendations had been approved. The adjudicator found that on the one occasion where Bateman's recommendation had not been followed, his superiors in Toronto appointed an employee despite Bateman's strenuous objections. The adjudicator found this to be evidence that Bateman's "freedom of action in this area was subordinated to the overriding interest of his Toronto superiors". The adjudicator also found that the Vice-President of data centre operations in Toronto retained control over all appointments to positions reporting directly to Bateman as Vancouver RDC manager.
Salaries:
[11]
The adjudicator also focused on the role Bateman played in completing yearly performance appraisals of Vancouver RDC employees. These appraisals had a direct bearing on any salary increase that would be received by an employee. While there is some dispute as to this matter (see Applicant's Record, Tab S, p. 15, and Tab 3, p. 3) any salary increase for an employee would apparently be determined by the RDC manager, who operated within guidelines and budgets set out by the CIBC's head office. The adjudicator found that Bateman had "total authority to award increases that fell within the guidelines, but that the approval of the Toronto data centre operations officer was required for any exceptions". He found that there was no evidence that the RDC managers had any input into the setting of the salary ranges, which had been set up by the CIBC to maintain consistent standards across the country. He also found that the effect of the salary ranges was to provide RDC managers with a "limited degree of authority whereby, within quite narrow guidelines, they could both recognize the superior achievements of their subordinates, and also penalize inferior performance".
[12]
RDC managers could request that exceptions be made to the guidelines to reward exceptional performance. A large number of these requests were approved by Toronto, but the evidence revealed that between 1988 and 1990, very few exceptions were proposed by RDC managers, except for Bateman. Most of his recommendations were eventually approved, but only after he had been advised that the total number of such recommendations was unacceptable, and that he reconsider and resubmit them.
Setting Staff Requirements:
[13]
The RDC managers were required to propose to the Head Office an appropriate number of full-time employees for their centres based on the anticipated amount of business as estimated by the managers in consultation with regional representatives from the other banking units of the CIBC, and using data provided by Head Office. Head Office had the power to approve these staff estimates, and any hiring that would have resulted in the approved number being exceeded required approval by Toronto in advance. The adjudicator found that "it was Toronto's judgment which unmistakably superseded that of the individual data centre manager". The adjudicator pointed to an incident in 1989 when Toronto unilaterally decided that the Vancouver RDC staff complement had five more positions than were required, and reduced the complement by that number despite the protests of Bateman that the positions were necessary to meet his goals for the RDC.
Discipline:
[14]
The adjudicator ruled that "the complainant was not constrained in any way by his regional office in exercising discipline within the Centre. I am much less satisfied regarding the constraints imposed by Toronto". While the evidence was conflicting, the adjudicator found that all dismissals proposed by data centre managers required prior approval from Toronto. As for discipline up to, but not including dismissal, there was evidence that on occasion, Bateman was ordered by his superiors to impose discipline on certain employees. The adjudicator concluded that while Head Office did not interfere frequently with Bateman's exercise of discipline, this restraint "should be attributed more to [Bateman's] sound judgment in the majority of cases, than to the Bank's contention that he had unfettered authority in all cases short of dismissal".
[15]
After consideration of other issues such as input by RDC managers into areas such as budgets and policy formulation, the adjudicator concluded that the stress placed by the CIBC on consistency, standardization and central control from Toronto was incompatible with true managerial autonomy and independence. He summarized his conclusions as follows (at Tab "S", pp. 27-28 of Applicant's Record):
"The CIBC or any organization of its size or complexity has in my view a choice to make regarding the extent to which it will decentralize its operations, and the degree to which it will make local and regional members of its management team autonomous. A perpetual conflict is likely to be waged in such an organization between the forces which favour tight centralized control in order to achieve consistency, and the forces which seek to encourage individual autonomy and the independence resulting from the provision of broad, general goals and the maintenance of accountability for successful results. There was some evidence adduced before me which was suggestive of some ebb and flow involving this issue.
"I have concluded that the proponents of centralized control are in the ascendancy within the Information Technology Division of the CIBC's Administrative Bank, and specifically within its data centre operations. There is no doubt in my mind but that all decisions of importance to the Bank are made in Toronto. The fact that Toronto encourages the input of its data centre managers does not alter my conclusion to any significant extent ..."
[16]
The adjudicator concluded (at Tab "S", p. 30):
"Counsel for the employer has adduced ample evidence to show that the complainant was not only a member of the management team and, therefore, an employee who exercises management functions, but was a relatively senior member of that team. The employer's case convinced me that the complainant did in fact exercise a degree of autonomy and independence, which enabled him to decide certain issues within a fairly tight framework established by his superiors in Toronto. However, that degree of autonomy was insufficient to convince me that he passed the test by which a manager may be distinguished from a superintendent."
Issue
[17]
Did the adjudicator err in ruling that he had jurisdiction to hear the complaint by finding that Bateman was not a "manager"?
Analysis
Introduction:
[18]
The wrongful dismissal provisions of the Canada
Labour Code
were considered by Strayer, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). His Lordship summarized the procedure under the legislation as follows (at p. 293 F.C.):
"Section 61.5 [as it then was, now 240] was inserted into the
Code
to provide, in effect, a grievance procedure for federally regulated employees not protected by collective bargaining agreements, allowing them to file complaints with respect to unjust dismissal. Where such a complaint is filed and the matter is not otherwise settled the Minister can appoint an Adjudicator. If the Adjudicator after holding a hearing concludes that the person was unjustly dismissed he can order compensation or reinstatement of that person or some other appropriate remedy. Subsection 61.5(4) specifically provides that no civil remedy which an employee may have against his employer is suspended or affected by this section ..."
[19]
Before addressing the substantive issue of whether or not Bateman was a "manager" within the meaning of the
Code
, some preliminary issues should be addressed. First, it must be observed that the proceedings before the adjudicator are shielded in certain circumstances from judicial review by the following privative clauses:
"243(1) Every order of an adjudicator appointed under subsection 242(1) is final and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court.
"(2) No order shall be made, process entered or proceeding taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit, or restrain an adjudicator in any proceedings of the adjudicator under s. 242."
In my opinion, these privative clauses do not pose an obstacle to judicial review in the case at hand. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, prohibition was sought to prevent an adjudicator from hearing a complaint of unjust dismissal on the ground that the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction because the termination was purportedly due to a lay-off for a "lack of work", which under the
Code
precluded consideration of the complaint. Strayer, J., ruled that the privative clauses quoted above did not impede the power of the court to review for jurisdictional errors. He stated (at p. 295 F.C., footnotes omitted):
"It is also important to note the privative clauses ... While [subsection 243(1)] might in any event be irrelevant as no 'order' has been made by the adjudicator, [subsection 243(2)] which purports to preclude any court process 'to ... prohibit or restrain an adjudicator in any of his proceedings' might be thought to apply. However, it has long been established that, notwithstanding such privative clauses, if a tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction then judicial review of its decision is permissible on the jurisdictional issue. Further, the courts have greatly expanded the concept of jurisdictional error to include decisions made in bad faith, decisions made on irrelevant material, decisions made without regard to relevant material, misinterpretations of statutes, and breaches of natural justice."
As a jurisdictional question is also at issue in the case at hand, judicial review is also permissible in this case.
Jurisdiction Of The Adjudicator
And The Standard Of Review:
[20]
Second, the appropriate standard of judicial review must be determined. The respondent Bateman argued forcefully that the court should not interfere with the adjudicator's preliminary decision, submitting that the court should not in effect substitute its conclusion on this issue for that of the adjudicator. In my opinion, however, it is appropriate for the court in this case to determine the legal issues in this matter in advance of any further proceedings, and then consider whether prohibition should be granted because the adjudicator was without jurisdiction. There is authority that in cases where the issues are essentially legal, and the facts are not in dispute, it is appropriate for the court to consider the legal issues and decide if there has been any excess of jurisdiction by the tribunal that would warrant prohibition:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.). This case turns on a relatively discrete legal question, the interpretation to be accorded to the term "manager". Also, the justification for such review is stronger in the case at hand than in
Bell
. In this case, the court has the benefit of the extensive findings of fact made by the adjudicator, and the legal issues have been argued extensively before both the adjudicator and the court. In
Bell
no submissions were made to the tribunal before prohibition was sought, which meant that the reviewing court in that case was deprived of the expertise of the tribunal. As for facts, the evidence before the court in
Bell
consisted of a single affidavit from the applicant.
[21]
I would also add that in addition to being consistent with
Bell
, review for jurisdictional error in this case would also be in accordance with the most recent tests on judicial review established by the Supreme Court of Canada.
[22]
In order for this court to grant prohibition, the adjudicator must have assumed jurisdiction he did not have. In the case at hand, the adjudicator could have exceeded his jurisdiction in one of two ways, depending on the interpretation placed upon s. 167(3) and in particular the word "manager". If it is determined that the question of who is a "manager" for the purposes of s. 167(3) is one that Parliament intended was to be within the jurisdiction conferred on the adjudicator, his decision cannot be reviewed for excess of jurisdiction unless the interpretation he has made is patently unreasonable;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.B.R.(2d) 237; 51 A.P.R. 237; 97 D.L.R.(3d) 417; 79 C.L.L.C. 14,209. On the other hand, if it is determined that s. 167(3) is a legislative provision conferring or limiting the adjudicator's jurisdiction, the proper standard of review is not whether the decision is "patently unreasonable", but its "correctness" as determined by this court;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[23]
The law on this issue was summarized as follows by Beetz, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  national des employés de la commission scolaire régionale de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 1086:
"It is, I think, possible to summarize in two propositions the circumstances in which an administrative tribunal will exceed its jurisdiction because of error:
1. if the question of law at issue is one within the tribunal's jurisdiction, it will only exceed its jurisdiction if it errs in a patently unreasonable manner; a tribunal which is competent to answer a question may make errors in so doing without being subject to judicial review;
2. if, however, the question at issue concerns a legislative provision limiting the tribunal's powers, a mere error will cause it to lose jurisdiction and subject the tribunal to judicial review."
[24]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), Stone, J., for the Federal Court of Appeal held that the determination of "manager" by an adjudicator involved the interpretation of a statutory provision that confers or limits jurisdiction. Therefore, the test of "patent unreasonableness" is not applicable in this case, and the adjudicator's decision is reviewable for mere errors of law.
[25]
I respectfully adopt the reasoning of Federal Court of Appeal in
Lee-Shanok
as determinative of the jurisdictional issue. However, since that decision the Supreme Court of Canada has refined and modified the test to be used in determining whether the interpretation of a statutory provision can be classified as conferring jurisdiction, or as a matter within the jurisdiction of the adjudicator. In
Bibeault
, supra, Beetz, J., held that a "pragmatic, functional approach" must be adopted in the resolution of this issue (at p. 1088 S.C.R.):
"The formalistic analysis of the preliminary or collateral question theory is giving way to a pragmatic and functional analysis, hitherto associated with the concept of the patently unreasonable error. At first sight it may appear that the functional analysis applied to cases of patently unreasonable error is not suitable for cases in which an error is alleged in respect of a legislative provision limiting a tribunal's jurisdiction. The difference between these two types of error is clear: only a patently unreasonable error results in an excess of jurisdiction when the question at issue is within the tribunal's jurisdiction, whereas in the case of a legislative provision limiting the tribunal's jurisdiction, a simple error will result in a loss of jurisdiction. It is nevertheless true that the first step in the analysis necessary in the concept of a 'patently unreasonable' error involves determining the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal. At this stage, the court examines not only the wording of the enactment conferring jurisdiction on the administrative tribunal, but the purpose of the statute creating the tribunal, the reason for its existence, the area of expertise of its members and the nature of the problem before the tribunal."
The "pragmatic, functional approach" to questions of jurisdiction was endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and
Canada (Procureur général) v. Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada
(1991), 123 N.R. 161 (S.C.C.). In my opinion, the application of the factors set out in
Bibeault
to the case at hand yield the same conclusion as to jurisdiction reached by Stone, J., in
Lee-Shanok
.
[26]
With respect to the wording of the enactment, the primary provision is s. 167(3), which reads as follows:
"167(3) Division XIV does not apply to or in respect of employees who are managers."
[27]
It is apparent that in expressly excluding the application of the unjust dismissal provisions in Division XIV of the
Code
to "managers", Parliament intended this provision to define and limit the inquiry upon which an adjudicator is entitled to embark. Section 167(3) is clearly "jurisdictional" in the sense that that term is normally understood. It is true that because "manager" is not defined in the
Code
, it could be argued that this could be a question to be left to the judgment of the adjudicator. Such an approach, though, could result in the scope of the adjudicator's jurisdiction being extended far beyond what Parliament intended, should the adjudicator adopt an exceedingly narrow definition of "manager". As Heald, J., noted  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Aviation
, supra, a comparison of "manager" in s. 167(3) with the term in immediately preceding subsections suggests that it is to have a somewhat narrower meaning in s. 167(3) than in other contexts. However, in the absence of an express provision in Division XIV that the determination of this point is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the adjudicator, I am reluctant to conclude that the adjudicator can entertain complaints from employees even if such a conclusion would verge on being "patently unreasonable". This could result in rendering the clear limitation in s. 167(3) practically superfluous.
[28]
As for the purpose of the statute and the reason for the adjudicator's existence, it appears from a reading of Division XIV that its purpose was to provide a summary grievance procedure for nonunionized workers in federal jurisdiction that would mirror the protection available to those employees protected by collective agreements: see the quote from Strayer, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra. As managers are not able to avail themselves of the grievance procedure in the usual labour relations context, it stands to reason that certain managers were not intended to have the benefit of Division XIV, bearing in mind the conclusion in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that s. 167(3) was not intended to exclude from adjudication all those persons who exercise
some
management functions. I would therefore be reluctant to read s. 167(3) as departing too far from the classifications used in normal labour relations.
[29]
As for the area of expertise of the adjudicator, it is true that adjudicators appointed under s. 240 of the
Code
generally possess specialized knowledge and experience in certain unjust dismissal matters. However, the legislation in question does not make it clear that a dispute such as that in the case at hand was intended to be resolved by the adjudicator.
[30]
Applying a "pragmatic and functional approach", I would conclude that, on the balance, it was not intended that the determination of the question of who is a "manager" for the purposes of s. 167(3) was intended to be within the jurisdiction conferred on the adjudicator. The next step is to examine the adjudicator's interpretation of "manager" in order to determine if the adjudicator erred in law in his interpretation. As "manager" is not a defined term, it is necessary to consult previous decisions in order to determine its definition.
[31]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the adjudicator determined that he did not have jurisdiction in view of his finding that the applicant was not a "manager". He had been hired as a Chief Foreign Exchange Trader in December 1982, but worked only as a Foreign Exchange Trader until he was dismissed in March 1985. The applicant's duties involved trading in foreign currency markets, which was considered to be a highly skilled position. In so doing he operated within restrictions and guidelines set down by the company. He did not supervise any other employees, nor discipline them or review their performance. Shortly before his dismissal he was retitled as "Assistant Vice-President", with an increase in annual salary of $10,000, but his authority and duties remained unchanged. The Federal Court of Appeal found that he was not a manager. Stone, J., stated, at p. 588 F.C.:
"In my view, care must be taken in determining whether a particular complainant is a 'manager'. [Section 240] of the
Code
provides employees not covered by a collective agreement with a remedy against unjust dismissal and the exception found in [subsection 167(3)] subtracts employees who are 'managers' from the body of persons enjoying that right. Consequently, the exception should not be wielded so as to strip the applicant of this protection simply because his job required him to exercise the power of independent decision making. As the adjudicator points out, the very nature of the applicant's employment as a foreign exchange trader on the trading room floor required such power and flexibility. His effectiveness depended on it. But to base a classification of 'manager' principally upon that fact is, in my view, to consider his position in isolation from the overall organization in which he functioned. If the adjudicator's reasoning be correct, then the applicant would have to be classified as a 'manager' even if he had worked alongside several other foreign currency dealers having the same authority to trade. Indeed, his fellow traders would have to be so classified as well. I cannot agree with this reasoning."
Stone, J., reviewed the authorities and found that the term "manager" had an administrative as opposed to operational nature, and that the applicant's duties did not contain an administrative element. He stated, at pp. 589-590 F.C.:
"In the
Gauthier
case, at page 4 of his decision the adjudicator defined 'manager' for the purposes of subsection 27(4) as 'an administrator having power of independent action, autonomy, and discretion', and on review, Mr. Justice Pratte found no error of law in his treatment of the term. The adjudicator in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case adopted this definition, and his interpretation of the subsection was, in turn, approved by Mr. Justice Heald at page 341 of his judgment. With respect, it seems that the adjudicator in the present case neglects the 'administrator' component of this judicially approved definition, an element reflected in the term 'directeur' which appears in the French text of the subsection and which is defined by
Le Petit Robert
as 'personne qui dirige, est a la tête'. It is clear that the applicant did not, in the sense of these definitions, direct or administer anything. He had virtually no input into the establishment of the guidelines; he merely did his job as a trader within their parameters. Perhaps, having hired the applicant as
Chief
Foreign Exchange Dealer, the respondent envisaged that he would become the head of a currency exchange department consisting of a number of traders. The reality of the situation was that he functioned simply as the sole foreign exchange trader, a role of an operational rather than administrative nature. I fail to see how his job contained the administrative element which I consider the term 'manager' requires. Accordingly, in my view, the adjudicator erred in determining he was without jurisdiction to dispose of the applicant's complaint on its merits."
[32]
In my opinion, the adjudicator erred in his interpretation of s. 167(3). He stated that in order to be considered a "manager" within the meaning of that subsection, "the degree of autonomy exercised by an employee must be, if not absolute, then very considerable". With respect to the adjudicator, such an approach extends the law on this issue considerably farther than envisaged by the Federal Court of Appeal. While a manager must be "an administrator having power of independent action, autonomy and discretion", it is unrealistic to demand that such autonomy approach the absolute in order to be considered a "manager", even in the "narrow" sense of s. 167(3). As counsel for the applicant argued, even the Chairman of the Board of a large corporation does not have absolute autonomy; he must answer to the Board of Directors. It is undisputed that Bateman did exercise significant autonomy and discretion in his position, with respect to salaries, discipline and the power to hire and transfer employees. Indeed, the adjudicator concluded that "the complainant did in fact exercise a degree of autonomy and independence, which enabled him to decide certain issues within a fairly tight framework established by his superiors in Toronto". The evidence also shows that even on the occasions when Bateman was required to seek approval of his decisions, his recommendations were generally accepted. The adjudicator seems to have focused instead on the occasional rejection of Bateman's recommendations by his superiors as more compelling.
[33]
In my opinion, the duties entrusted to the complainant as head of the Vancouver RDC clearly contained the "administrative element" required by Stone, J., in
Lee-Shanok
. As a senior member of the CIBC management, he was required to administer a large department and supervise some 200 employees. There is no indication in
Lee-Shanok
that the complainant's autonomy and power to administer must be as independent from outside review as is required by the adjudicator. Indeed, it seems implicit from Stone, J.'s, reasons that a position as "the head of a currency exchange department consisting of a number of traders" would be considered sufficiently administrative in nature to be classified as "managerial". In my opinion, the duties of Bateman in the case at hand are analogous to this example, and would be considered "managerial" as well.
[34]
Accordingly, the adjudicator is without jurisdiction to hear the complaint, and the application for prohibition is granted. With respect to the application for certiorari and a stay of proceedings, it is not necessary to examine these issues. With regard to certiorari, the adjudicator's decision is necessarily quashed because of my ruling that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction in hearing the complaint. As for the order seeking a stay of proceedings in the interim, it appears that the adjudicator exercised his discretion not to proceed until a decision came from this court on the jurisdictional issue, and therefore a decision on that point is also unnecessary.
Application allowed.
