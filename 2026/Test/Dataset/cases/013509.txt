Hargrave, Prothonotary
: This application, by the plaintiff, Armeco Construction Ltd. ("Armeco") which arises out of work done by Armeco at Victoria Airport Terminal complex in 1986 and 1987, is for production of nine expert's reports, collectively known as the Hunter Report.
Background:
[2]
The work on the Terminal was completed on April 20, 1987, a time overrun of about seven months. However, some ten months earlier, in June 1986, Armeco had presented a claim to the Crown for additional payment.
[3]
On August 26, 1986, Transport Canada wrote to the Department of Justice to enclose Armeco's claim for additional payment, up to June 20, 1986. In that letter they conceded there could be some basis in fact for Armeco's claim, but that they felt that the amount claimed was excessive. Department of Transport went on to say that a compromise appeared unlikely and asked the Department of Justice to assign a well-experienced civil litigation lawyer to review the material. At that time the contract was about 60% completed. The letter goes on to say that Transport Canada anticipate further claims by the contractor.
[4]
The Department of Justice lawyer, Karl Burdak, in an affidavit of July 12, 1994, sets out that following discussions with Transport Canada, in September 1986, he came to share the view of Transport Canada, that a compromise with Armeco was unlikely and that arbitration or litigation was a reasonable likelihood.
[5]
Mr. Burdak concluded that an independent expert ought to be retained for the dominant purpose of assisting him in understanding the issues so that he, Mr. Burdak, could provide appropriate advice to the Crown. Mr. Burdak recommended David Hunter of Eurotech Consultants Ltd., who was retained in 1986.
[6]
The terms under which Eurotech Consultants Ltd. were engaged were as follows:
"Provide nonconsulting services to investigate and report on project S1-P170-0088, Victoria Air Terminal modifications for the purpose of providing the Minister of Justice and his legal offices with reports to assist legal counsel in preparation of legal advice in connection with litigation [sic] in progress or contemplated."
[7]
The terms of engagement have the flavour of a formula and without more I would give them little weight. However, we have Mr. Burdak's evidence that he not only recommended Mr. Hunter be retained for the dominant purpose of assisting him in understanding the issues so that he might advise the Crown and also that each of the nine reports were provided directly to Mr. Burdak, by Mr. Hunter and were for the purpose of assisting him in analyzing Armeco's various claims and providing advice and assistance to the Crown in preparing and conducting the defence of this action, which was commenced in June of 1989.
[8]
Following the initial claim of some $900,000 in June 1986, Armeco presented an updated claim, November 10, 1986, of just over $1.3 million and a New Approach claim, April 20, 1988, of over $2.7 million.
[9]
In commenting on these claims Mr. Burdak says:
"The presentation of each of these claims strengthened my opinion that it was unlikely that Armeco's claims could be resolved short of litigation. In fact, the last claim made specific reference to legal opinions which had been obtained by Armeco." (paragraph 7 of Burdak affidavit of July 12, 1994)
[10]
The Hunter Report, the production of which Armeco request, consists of nine reports as follows:
(a) "Contractor's Claim and Possible Counterclaim" dated February 11, 1987 (with Addendum dated March 10, 1987);
(b) "Contractor's Claim - New Bases of Claim" dated April 22, 1987;
(c) "Review of Consultant Services with Regard to Construction Costs" dated April 26, 1988;
(d) "Contractor's 'New Approach' Claim Presentation - Review and Recommendation" dated August 9, 1988 (with Addendum dated September 19, 1988);
(e) "Contractor's 'New Approach' Claim - Recommended Defense" dated November 29, 1988;
(f) "Contractor's Claim - Negotiation" dated December 4, 1988;
(g) "Contractor's Claim - Audit - Interim Report" dated July 31, 1989;
(h) "Contractor's Claim - Possible Counterclaim" dated August 25, 1989; and
(i) "Audit of Contractor's Project Documentation - Report and Recommendations" dated December 17, 1989.
[11]
Portions of the Hunter Report have been produced to the plaintiff. However the parties agreed that the production of that material did not constitute a waiver of the privilege which the defendant claims.
[12]
The defendant says that the reports are privileged and that eight of them are relevant.
Plaintiff's Position
[13]
The affidavit of Peter Malick, Vice President of Armeco, sworn July 14, 1994, sets out that in late 1986 he met with David Hunter at the Armeco office in connection with an audit. He also met with David Hunter and others involved in the project some time after April 20, 1988, and was in regular contact with representatives of Transport Canada. In late summer of 1988, Armeco proposed mediation or arbitration, but could not obtain the Crown's consent. By late 1988, it became apparent to Mr. Malick that the claims would not be resolved through negotiation, arbitration or mediation. Subsequently Armeco decided to commence this action in which the statement of claim was issued June 26, 1989.
[14]
Mr. Malick sets out, in paragraph 8 of his affidavit that:
"Prior to the commencement of this action, through my various communications with defendant regarding Armeco's claims, no individual that I met with was identified to me as being a lawyer acting for the defendant."
and in paragraph 9:
"At no point prior to the commencement of this action did any representative of the defendant with whom I spoke ever discuss the prospect of Armeco's claims proceeding to litigation rather than being resolved by negotiation."
[15]
Mr. Malick may be mistaken in that he may have been introduced to Karl Burdak during the late 1986 meeting, however there is no affidavit evidence on that point.
[16]
Counsel for Armeco points out that throughout the production of the various reports that make up the Hunter Report the defendant continued to negotiate. He submits that it was not until December 1988 that litigation appeared necessary, at least from Armeco's point of view and that giving of legal advice, before December 1988 should not go to establishing privilege.
[17]
Counsel for Armeco relies upon
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), for the proposition that
"only after all attempts at settlement had failed could it be said that there was a 'reasonable expectation of litigation'." (page 212)
[18]
Armeco relies on the dominant purpose test set out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for lawyers is not enough to create privilege. There must be clear evidence of impending litigation at the time the reports were commissioned by defendant's counsel.
Defendant's Submission
[19]
On August 26, 1986, the Regional Director of Transport Canada, Airports Authority Group, wrote to the Department of Justice to enclose a copy of the June 20, 1986, Armeco claim for additional costs in the amount of $937,334. He went on to say:
"A compromise appears unlikely and we shall appreciate it if you will assign a well-experienced civil litigation lawyer to review the attached package of documents."
and that:
"The construction contract is only about 60% completed and that further claims by the contractor may be anticipated."
[20]
Karl Burdak, of the Department of Justice, became the responsible lawyer. His affidavit evidence is that after reading the August 26, 1986 Transport Canada letter and the claim for extra costs and having an initial discussion with Transport Canada representatives in early September 1986, he became aware that the representatives of Transport Canada believed that a compromise with Armeco was unlikely and that arbitration or litigation was a reasonable likelihood. He goes on to say that at that time he shared the same view.
[21]
Mr. Burdak concluded that an independent expert should be retained for the dominant purpose of assisting him in understanding the issues so that he might provide appropriate advice to the Crown. As a result David Hunter, of Eurotech Consultants Ltd., was retained. Mr. Hunter had no previous involvement.
[22]
After Mr. Hunter was hired, Armeco presented two further formal claims, $1,339,883 on November 10, 1986 and $2,734,854 on April 20, 1988. Mr. Burdak's evidence is that:
"The presentation of each of these claims strengthened my opinion that it was unlikely that Armeco's claims could be resolved short of litigation. In fact, the last claim made specific reference to a legal opinion obtained by Armeco." (paragraph 7 of Burdak affidavit sworn July 1994)
The effect of the successive claims was to widen the gulf between the parties.
[23]
Mr. Burdak, in his affidavit, then sets out that on his instruction Mr. Hunter prepared the nine reports, making up what the parties have called the Hunter Report and that:
"Each of the reports ... were provided directly to me by Mr. Hunter and were for the purpose of assisting me in analyzing Armeco's various claims and providing advice and assistance to Her Majesty in preparing and conducting the defence of this action, which eventually was commenced in June 1989."
and that:
"After receiving the reports I provided copies to Mr. Lloyd Thate who was the engineer appointed pursuant to the contract between Her Majesty and Armeco. These reports form part of the advice which I was providing to Her Majesty with respect to Armeco's claim."
[24]
My understanding is that Mr. Thate, in due course, returned his copy of the Hunter Report to Mr. Burdak.
[25]
Counsel for the defendant stresses that Mr. Hunter was instructed by counsel who felt that the claim could not be settled and that all of the reports were sent to the lawyer who commissioned them, Karl Burdak. Counsel stresses that these were reports specifically prepared for a lawyer who believed that there would be litigation, as contrasted with a routine report commissioned by a party who might have had other purposes for obtaining expert advice.
Analysis
[26]
I have considered whether I ought to require the defendant to produce to me the Hunter Report for examination. However I believe that the question of privilege can be decided on the evidence.
[27]
While there are overall principles that apply in determining privilege, claims of privilege should be looked at on a case by case basis. To begin, the onus is on the party claiming the privilege, in this case the defendant, to establish the privilege.
[28]
While the general trend may be toward more production of documents and the erosion of privilege, there must be some limit. In this instance counsel for the defendant suggests a number of factors going to establish privilege: The Hunter Report was commissioned by a lawyer, who was engaged by a client, the client feeling settlement was unlikely and that they should have advice from a litigation lawyer; before retaining the expert, Mr. Hunter, the defendant's lawyer decided that a compromise was unlikely and that arbitration or litigation was a reasonable likelihood; and as a result of these views the defendant's lawyers decided that an independent expert should be retained for the dominant purpose of assisting him in analyzing Armeco's claims so that he could provide the appropriate advice.
[29]
Indeed, by at least April 1988 both sides were taking advice from their lawyers. By April of 1988 the lawyers for Armeco had passed along to their principals a recent similar decided case. Giving the amount at stake and the fact that during some eighteen months, from the date of the first Armeco claim, the parties had not been able to reach a resolution, portions of the Hunter Report from and after the April 26, 1988 report, must certainly have been in contemplation of litigation and for that dominant purpose.
[30]
This leaves two of the documents making up the Hunter Report, the "Contractor's Claim and Possible Counterclaim" of February 11, 1987 and the "Contractor's Claim - New Bases of Claim" dated April 22, 1987, to consider in the light of Karl Burdak's affidavit evidence that during that time period he believed that compromise was unlikely, arbitration or litigation was a reasonable likelihood and that he required an independent expert to assist him in understanding the issues so that he could provide appropriate advice to Her Majesty, all of which resulted in the hiring of David Hunter (paragraphs 4 and 5 of Burdak affidavit of July 12, 1994). In addition I must deal with the fact that the parties were still negotiating when parts of the Hunter Report was being produced.
[31]
In both the
Philippine Victory
, supra, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  survey reports, prepared in a routine manner, even though litigation was a possibility, were privileged. Those surveys were prepared in the ordinary course of business.
[32]
A similar issue arose in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). In that case an appraisal, prepared at the request of a party, before the involvement of the party's lawyer, in a type of matter which might be potentially litigious, was held not privileged. However the court in that case did set out a useful test:
"Turning now to the legal principles applicable to a factual situation of this kind, it seems clear that communications between a party and a nonprofessional agent are only privileged if they are made both -- (1) for the purpose of being laid before a solicitor or counsel for the purpose of obtaining his advice or of enabling him to prosecute or defend an action or prepare a brief; and (2) for the purpose of litigation existing or in contemplation at the time. Both of these conditions must be fulfilled in order that the privilege may exist."
[33]
In the
McPhail's Equipment
case the event triggering the dispute had only occurred a few days before the expert's report had been ordered and thus there had been no negotiations and it was impossible to say whether the parties, on bargaining, might not have come to a settlement. That prompted the court to comment that "only after all attempts at settlement had failed could it be said that there was a 'reasonable expectation of litigation'". (page 298) The report was not for the purpose of being laid before counsel for the purpose of obtaining advice.
[34]
In both the
Philippine Victory
and in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case the court noted that negotiations had not run their course and that litigation was not a reasonable expectation. Depending upon the facts in the particular case the presence or absence of negotiations are not deciding factors. Everyone hopes for resolutions without resort to trial and in that sense there is always the possibility of a negotiated settlement. Rather the important factors are the purpose of the material over which privilege is claimed and the likelihood of litigation.
[35]
The pre-1980 cases must be considered with caution, for our court has adopted the dominant purpose rule, which came out of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.L.) in the
Waugh
case the House of Lords held that to be privileged the dominant purpose of the document in question must be submission to a legal adviser in view of litigation, but that dominant purpose did not mean sole purpose: see page 533, 537 and 544.
[36]
Counsel for the defendant suggests that the dominant purpose rule does not apply to reports commissioned by lawyers.
[37]
In the
Philippine Victory
, supra, the court noted that the privilege survey reports, ordered by solicitors were for the dominant purpose of preparing or assisting in litigation (page 192).
[38]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  were held privileged, while other survey reports, which were of a routine nature and which resulted in the settling of twenty-one claims, in another jurisdiction, without litigation, were ordered produced.
[39]
Certainly in these two cases survey reports for which the dominant purpose was not litigation were produced, whereas survey reports commissioned by the lawyers were held privileged.
[40]
Counsel for the defendants in support of the idea that lawyer-commissioned material is not subject to the dominant purpose test, referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), for the proposition that:
"... the purpose of the privilege is to ensure that a solicitor may, for the purpose of preparing himself to advise or conduct proceedings, proceed with complete confidence that the protected information or material he gathers from his clients and others for this purpose and what advice he gives, will not be disclosed to anyone except with the consent of his client." (page 136)
[41]
In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case the Court of Appeal went on to note that not everything a solicitor does or collects is privileged and that:
"There are really two overlapping questions here. The first problem relates to the dominant purpose rule and the second is whether solicitors privilege extends to the kind of documents in question in this application." (page 136)
The court went on to touch on the dominant purpose rule and noted that counsel claimed no privilege for original documents created before litigation was anticipated.
[42]
I would suggest that when a lawyer commissions a report which, as in this instance, is used to give advice to the client, that should be a factor going to establish dominant purpose. And indeed, in the
Waugh
case, the four Law Lords, who gave reasons, approved of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Lord Edmund-Davies at page 544 quoted a passage from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  which claim attention, I have come to the conclusion that the court should state the relevant principle as follows:
a document which was produced or brought into existence
either
with the dominant purpose of its author, or of the person or authority under whose direction, whether particular or general, it was produced or brought into existence, of using it or its contents in order to obtain legal advice
or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect,
should be privileged
and excluded from inspection."
(underlining added)
[43]
I do not read this passage as negating application of the dominant purpose test in the case of the use of a document in obtaining legal advice. Similarly, the result of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  anticipated.
[44]
Mr. Burdak's affidavit evidence that by early September 1986 he shared the view of Transport Canada that a compromise with Armeco was unlikely and that arbitration or litigation was a reasonable likelihood and further that the presentation of the revised Armeco claims, November 10, 1986 and April 20, 1988, strengthened his opinion that it was unlikely that the Armeco claims could be resolved short of litigation, gives weight to the defendant's assertion of privilege.
[45]
I have decided that the commission by the defendant's lawyer of each portion of the Hunter Report was at a time when litigation was a reasonable expectation and that the Hunter Report was dominantly for the purpose either of giving legal advice in the case of earlier portions of the Report (up to April 1988) or later, to defend the case, when litigation became more and more certain, or indeed had been commenced.
[46]
The whole of the Hunter Report is privileged.
Order accordingly.
