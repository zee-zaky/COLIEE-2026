[1] Gibson, J.
: This is an application by the defendant (the "applicant") to appeal the order dated the 9th day of November, 1993 of the Associate Senior Prothonotary whereby he dismissed an application by the applicant for:
1. An order directing any issues of fact in this action relating to the extent of the infringement of any right, the damages flowing from the infringement of any right or the profits arising from any infringement of any right be, after trial, the subject of a reference should it then appear that such issues are required to be decided;
2. An order that the parties proceed to trial without adducing evidence upon any issue of fact reserved for the reference;
3. Costs of the motion on a solicitor and client basis; and
4. Such further and other relief as to this court may seem just.
[2]
The authority for the order sought from the Associate Senior Prothonotary is rule 480 of the
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 663 (the "
Rules
") which reads as follows:
"480(1) Any party desiring to proceed to trial without adducing evidence upon any issue of fact including, without limiting the generality thereof,
(a) any question as to the extent of the infringement of any right,
(b) any question as to the damages flowing from any infringement of any right, and
(c) any question as to the profits arising from any infringement of any right,
shall, at least 10 days before the day fixed for the commencement of trial, apply for an order that such issue of fact be, after trial, the subject of a reference under rules 500 et seq. if it then appears that such issue requires to be decided.
"(2) An order of the kind contemplated by para. (1) may be made at any time before or during trial and may be made by the court of its own motion."
[3]
The application before me was based on rules 336(5) and 480 of the
Rules
. Rule 336(5) reads as follows:
"(5) Any person affected by an order or decision of prothonotary, other than a judgment under rules 432 to 437, may appeal therefrom to the court and such appeal shall be made by an application of which a notice shall be given to all interested parties setting forth the grounds of objection and served within 14 days after the order or decision complained of, and 4 clear days before the day fixed for hearing the same, or served within such other time as may be allowed by the court or a prothonotary on ex parte application. The appeal shall be filed not later than 2 days before the date named for hearing (In this paragraph 'court' means 'Trial Division', if the matter is in the Trial Division, and 'Court of Appeal', if the matter is in the Court of Appeal.)"
[4]
The relief requested on, and the grounds for, the application before me are set out in the Notice of Motion in the following terms:
"- Relief requested -
1. An order directing any issues of fact in this action relating to the extent of the infringement of any right or the profits arising from any infringement of any right be, after trial, the subject of a reference should it then appear that such issues are required to be decided.
2. An order that the parties proceed to trial without adducing evidence upon any issue of fact reserved for the reference.
4. Such further and other relief as to this Honourable Court may seem just."
[5]
No paragraph 3 appears in the Notice of Motion as filed. I presume it was omitted in error and, if included, would have related to costs. Paragraph 1 is narrower than the equivalent paragraph that was before the Associate Senior Prothonotary in that it makes no reference to damages. I was advised by counsel that this flows from a decision by or on behalf of the plaintiffs to pursue relief by way of recovery of profits rather than damages.
"- Grounds -
1. The Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law and in principle in his determination that the applicatant for an order pursuant to rule 480 of the
Federal Court Rules
must establish that it will be 'unusually inconvenienced' if the order is not granted.
2. The Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law and in principle by considering that the effect of the order of Mr. Justice Collier dated July 22, 1992 in this proceeding was to mandate that sales records be kept in any particular organizational fashion. Thus, the Associate Senior Prothonotary also erred in his determination that if Apotex complied with the order of Mr. Justice Collier, Apotex could produce its sales record without significant effort. Finally, the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law and principle by holding that if Apotex could produce its sales records without significant effort, an order under rule 480 should not issue.
3. The Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law and in principle by allowing the plaintiffs, the Upjohn Company and Upjohn Inter-American Corporation ('Upjohn'), to file the Affidavit of K. Anne Marshall ('Marshall Affidavit') at the hearing of the motion without the consent of Apotex; such filing following the completion of the cross-examination of representatives [of] both Apotex and Upjohn.
4. The Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law and in principle by allowing the statements contained in the Marshall Affidavit to impugn the credibility of Bernard Sherman because the issues raised in the Marshall Affidavit were not raised in the Affidavit of Bernard Sherman, nor where questions concerning these issues directed to Bernard Sherman in cross-examination, nor was Bernard Sherman given an opportunity to respond.
5. The Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law and in principle by refusing, on the basis of no evidence, to exercise his discretion to make an order under rule 480 when there was no evidence presented as to any basis in law to refuse the relief sought."
[6]
At the time the Associate Senior Prothonotary gave his order, he also pronounced oral reasons. Unfortunately, no transcript was made of his reasons and counsel, despite references to their notes, were not fully in agreement as to the substance of his reasons. Thus, the words "unusually inconvenienced" which appear in quotation marks in the first ground set out above, and which purport to be a direct quotation from the Associate Senior Prothonotary's oral reasons, have been considered by me to be out of quotation marks.
[7]
Rule 480 provides no guidance as to the basis on which the discretion conferred thereby should be exercised. Evidence before me indicates that, in intellectual property matters at least, of which this is one involving as it does claims for infringement of a registered trademark and other trademarks, passing-off contrary to the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13 and activity contrary to the
Copyright Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, orders are often made under rule 480 on consent. Obviously, there is no consent here.
[8]
Three cases that have been decided in the Federal Court of Appeal provide some guidance. The earlier two deal with applications under rule 480 while the latest deals with appeals from decisions of prothonotaries. The earliest is
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, Jacket, C.J., stated at pp. 53 and 54:
"In dismissing the application, the learned trial judge said:
'In the absence of consent and of compelling reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole, conventional procedures should be maintained.'
"I should be content to dismiss the appeal for the reasons given by the learned trial judge, which, in my view, succinctly and completely state why the application should have been dismissed.
"However, for such help as it may be in connection with the application of rule 480, I propose to discuss the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant. For that purpose, I think it is sufficient to refer to the foundation for that argument as set forth in para. 10 of the appellants memorandum, which reads:
Part III
Argument
10. It is respectfully submitted that the purpose of rule 480(b) and (c) is, inter alia, two-fold:
(i) to protect the integrity of the confidential financial affairs of the parties to an action until such time as such information must be disclosed in order to enable the court to fix a quantum of damages; and
(ii) to ensure that purely mechanical calculations do not unnecessarily engaged [sic] this Honourable Court at formal trial proceedings when such calculations can more easily be done before a Prothonotary or other officer.
It is respectfully submitted that on both accounts, the matter of the calculation of damages or an accounting of profits in this action, should be so referred.
"Dealing first with the 'purpose' of rule 480 as propounded by subparagraph (i) of paragraph 10, no authority is cited for the proposition that the rule is designed 'to protect the integrity of the confidential financial affairs of the parties ...' and I am of opinion that no such right to confidentiality can be implied in this rule, which was made pursuant to powers for making procedural rules. Insofar as a plaintiff at least is concerned, I am of opinion that it cannot be said that it is wrong for a trial judge to refuse an application under rule 480 when that application is based, as this application was, exclusively on a desire by the plaintiff to keep confidential as long as possible information pertinent to the establishment of his cause of action.
"With reference to the 'purpose' of rule 480 as propounded by subparagraph (ii) of paragraph 10, I am of the view that it is not put in proper perspective. Purely 'mechanical calculations' are not as such beneath the dignity of the trial judge. The real purpose of leaving the rule 480 class of matters to a reference, as I understand it, is to minimize the expense of an action. It is a matter of discretion in any particular action to forecast whether the most economical manner of conducting the action is to have the plaintiff prove his whole case in the first instance so that, if the plaintiff ultimately loses on the merits, the cost of establishing profits or losses will have been thrown away or whether such questions should be left until the substantive rights have been established in which event there may be the costs or two trials and two sets of appeals instead of the costs of one trial and one set of appeals. It is impossible to enumerate in a general way all the factors that, in a particular case, may or should be taken into account by the trial judge in reaching a conclusion on this question. In my view, however, within broad limits, it is a matter of discretion for the trial judge and his decision will not be set aside on appeal unless he has committed manifest error.
"What is clear, in my view, is that, as the learned trial judge has indicated the general principle is that the plaintiff must make out the whole of his case in the first instance; and, in the absence of consent or of 'reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole', rule 480 should not be invoked to set that principle aside."
[9]
In
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), affirmed on appeal (1988), 23 C.P.R.(3d) 287 (F.C.A.), Joyal, J., stated:
"This kind of case-splitting finds favour in many patent infringement proceedings. No doubt its process is usually attractive to both parties. It facilitates and expedites the trial of the infringement issue leaving to a subsequent reference, if such should be found necessary, the determination of damages.
"The affidavit filed by the plaintiffs in support of this motion appears at first blush to be quite persuasive. It is certain that for purposes of the trial and of all proceedings leading to it, the infringement issues raised in the pleadings are sufficiently complex that leaving the damages issue to a later date would certainly expedite the whole process and avoid long and laborious enquiries into damages which might later on prove to be pointless. In a normal case, therefore, it would be logical and reasonable to proceed in that fashion.
And later:
"It would also appear that rule 480 has not often been applied without the consent of the parties.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal stated that as rule 480 is an exceptional procedure, a reference should not be ordered absent consent of the parties or reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole."
[10]
The third case, the one which deals with appeals from prothonotaries, is
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . McGuigan, J.A., writing for the majority, spoke of the standard of review to be applied by a motions judge in reviewing a discretionary decision of a prothonotary in the following terms at pp. 295 and 296:
"I also agree with the Chief Justice in part as to the standard of review to be applied by a motions judge to a discretionary decision of a prothonotary. Following in particular Lord Wright in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 484, and Lacourcière, J.A., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , discretionary orders of prothonotaries ought not to be disturbed on appeal to a judge unless:
(a) they are clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts, or
(b) they raise questions vital to the final issue of the case. [See footnote 5]
"Where such discretionary orders are clearly wrong in that the prothonotary has fallen into error of law (a concept in which I include a discretion based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts), or where they raise questions vital to the final issue of the case, a judge ought to exercise his own discretion de novo.
"In
Ship ' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 127, this court in an obiter dictum stated the rule the other way around, seeking to emphasize the necessity for the exercise of the judge's discretion de novo, in contradistinction to the view that was at that time gaining acceptance in the Trial Division that the prothonotary's discretion should be followed unless he had committed error of law.
Jala Godavari
should not, I think, be read as meaning that the prothonotary's discretion should never be respected, but rather that it is subject to an overriding discretion by a judge where the question involved is vital to the final issue of the case. (Error of law is, of course, always a reason for intervention by a judge, and is not in any way in controversy)."
[11]
Certain principles that are binding on me can be derived from the above cases and may be summarized as follows.
[12]
First, the standard of review on appeals from prothonotaries is whether the order of the prothonotary "is clearly wrong" in the sense described by McGuigan, J.A., in
Aqua-Gem
or the order of the prothonotary raises a question or questions vital to the final issue of the case. If either is the case, the reviewing judge ought to exercise his or her own discretion de novo.
[13]
Secondly, assuming the standard of review is met and the reviewing judge is therefore charged with exercising his or her discretion de novo, he or she should be guided by the principle that an order under rule 480 providing for a reference after trial is an exceptional procedure and that, in the absence of consent or compelling reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole, conventional procedures should be maintained. Protection for as long as possible of confidential information is not, of itself, compelling reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole.
[14]
Thirdly, compelling reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole are, or include, reasons directed to the minimization of the expense of the action.
[15]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Henry, J., considered an appeal from an order of a master involving rule 31.06(5) of the Ontario
Rules of Civil Procedure
(R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194). That rule, which is parallel to rule 480 but narrower in scope, reads as follows:
"31.06(5) Where information may become relevant only after the determination of an issue in the action and the disclosure of the information before the issue is determined would seriously prejudice a party, the court on the party's motion may grant leave to withhold the information until after the issue has been determined."
[16]
It is interesting to note that the Ontario rule incorporates a test of "serious prejudice" as contrasted with the "compelling reasons" test referred to above. I conclude that the "serious prejudice" test is narrower than a "compelling reasons" test but included within the latter unless the latter is strictly limited to reasons directed to the minimization of the expense of the action and I do not read the foregoing cases as limiting "compelling reasons" exclusively to this objective.
[17]
Henry, J., set out six principles to be applied in considering applications in relations to the Ontario rule. They are the following:
"(1) The decision to postpone disclosure of information and documents to a later stage, which inevitably postpones the consequential issue to a later stage and a further trial, is ultimately a matter of the discretion of the court having regard to all the circumstances.
"(2) The modern philosophy which is inherent in the new Rules of Civil Procedure is that there should be the fullest disclosure of information on all issues to be tried with a view to the speedy and efficient resolution of those issues at one time in one trial.
"(3) Postponement of production and discovery under rules 30.08 and 31.06 should be resorted to only the clearest of cases; full disclosure before trial is the norm and indeed, the prima facie right of both parties.
"(4) Where the threshold issue is not clearly severable from the consequential issue, in the sense that information sought to be withheld is not relevant to determination of the threshold issue, leave to divide discoveries and productions ought not to be granted since that could deprive the party of information necessary to establish or fortify its case; this is not a matter of discretion. In considering whether the information may become relevant only after the threshold issue is determined, the court ought to consider any possible relevance that the information sought to be withheld may have in determining the threshold issue, including questions of credibility.
"(5) Once the court concludes that the issues are severable within the sense described, the test to be applied is serious prejudice to the moving party; that is the only test prescribed by the rule where the threshold and consequential issues are severable. Determination of serious prejudice to the party is not a matter of discretion but is a finding of fact for the court to make. If the court is unable to find serious prejudice by immediate disclosure of the information, the rule does not permit disclosure to be postponed. If, on the other hand the court finds that serious prejudice to the party will result, the court must then consider how to exercise its discretion.
"(6) The decision to exercise the courts' discretion must then be made on the usual basis - judicially, in accordance with proper principles, on a case-by-case basis, accordingly to all the circumstances of the case."
[18]
With appropriate modifications, I find the foregoing to be a very helpful elaboration of the principles that I have derived above. I note at this point that Henry, J.'s, fourth principle is not here at issue. Counsel for both parties acknowledged before me that the issues here proposed to be severed and reserved for a reference are readily severable from the issue of liability.
[19]
I turn then, to the case before me. It is difficult in circumstances where no written reasons are provided and no verbatim transcript was kept to determine whether an order of a prothonotary is clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by him or her was based on a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts, or raises a question vital to the final issue of the case. Starting with the last first, there was no allegation before me, and I cannot conceive of how there could have been before the Associate Senior Prothonotary, that severance of the trial issues as proposed would have for the reference a question vital to the final issue of the case, that is, whether or not the applicant defendant was liable as claimed by the plaintiffs. I therefore find that the order here in question ought not to be disturbed on that ground.
[20]
If, however, as is alleged by the applicant, the Associate Senior Prothonotary based his order on a finding that the applicant had failed to establish that it would be unusually inconvenienced by the failure to grant the order sought, then I would find that the order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary is clearly wrong in that it was based upon a wrong principle. In such circumstances I ought to exercise my own discretion de novo. In the absence of clear evidence, or indeed any evidence, that the Associate Chief Prothonotary did not proceed on this wrong principle as alleged on behalf of the applicant, I conclude that I should exercise my own discretion de novo.
[21]
I therefore proceed, in the absence of consent to an order under rule 480, to determine whether the applicant has established compelling reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole as to why an order under rule 480 should be granted. I am mindful of the third principle which I have enunciated above that compelling reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole are, or at least include, reasons directed to the minimization of the expense of the action.
[22]
This is not an easy task. If forcing the applicant to discovery on issues relating to its profits would facilitate the possibility of settlement, as is alleged by the plaintiff, and if settlement resulted then there would be no doubt that denial of an order under rule 480 would work to minimize the expense of the action. But the applicant denies that early discovery on issues relating to its profits would facilitate settlement. The applicant alleges that the plaintiffs have sufficient information regarding its sales and costs related to sales of the product in question to adequately articulate an offer of settlement should they wish to do so. In support of its position, the applicant points to the fact that Paul Herbert, when examined for discovery on his affidavit on behalf of the plaintiffs on this motion, refused to answer questions on the issue of the plaintiffs' knowledge of the sales and costs of the applicant. It was argued before me that, based on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.), I am entitled to draw an adverse inference against the plaintiffs, as to their knowledge, based on this refusal to answer and should in fact, do so.
[23]
For the applicants, it was argued that if issues related to determination of profits were severed and the issue of liability were determined at trial against the plaintiffs, then clearly the expense of the action as a whole would have been minimized. It was argued on behalf of the applicant that postponement of discovery of the applicant on issues related to sales and costs would in itself constitute a major cost saving since determination of costs, sales and profits and allocation thereof to the various components of the plaintiffs claim would be a complex, time consuming and expensive task, notwithstanding the order of Collier, J., that has been in place for many months and that, among other things, requires the applicant to maintain records of its sales of the product in question, though not of its costs or its profits. Further, it was argued, postponement of discovery on these issues would protect from the plaintiffs until a later date and perhaps for all time, confidential information to which the plaintiffs should not have access in the event they are unable to establish liability.
[24]
In reply, the plaintiffs not surprisingly argued that, if an order under rule 480 were granted and the trial was thus split, the parties and the court would be forced to the inconvenience and expense of two sets of discoveries, two hearings and the possibility of two appeals in the event that the applicant was determined to be liable. The result would be, of course, greater overall expense of the action.
[25]
On balance, despite the able argument of counsel for the applicant, I conclude that the applicant has failed to discharge the onus on it. To reiterate, "... in the absence of consent or of reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a 'whole', ..., conventional procedures should be maintained.
Brouwer Turf
, supra. Against the principles drawn from the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Procter & Gamble
cases cited above the applicant has failed to demonstrate compelling reasons bearing on the conduct of the action as a whole as to why the relief sought should be granted. I so conclude whether or not compelling reasons are restricted to reasons directed to the minimization of the expense of the action. On the issue of minimization of expense, the evidence before me was equivocal. Adding to such that evidence as favours the applicants, the evidence regarding premature or unnecessary disclosure of confidential information, I still conclude that the weight of evidence in favour of the applicant does not reach the threshold of "compelling reasons."
[26]
Against the principles enunciated by Henry, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> cited above, suitably modified, I would reach the same conclusion.
[27]
In arriving at my decision, I have disregarded the affidavit of K. Ann Marshall sworn the 5th day of November, 1993 and filed at the hearing before the Associate Senior Prothonotary. It was argued before me that the filing of this affidavit was improper and prejudiced the applicant's case. I make no finding in this regard except to say that the affidavit in no way influenced me in reaching the decision that I have.
[28]
I have today issued an order dismissing the application before me and providing for costs of the application to the plaintiffs in the cause.
Appeal dismissed.
