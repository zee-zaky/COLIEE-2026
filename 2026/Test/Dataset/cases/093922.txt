Introduction
[1]
MacKay, J.
: In this action, begun by statement of claim on September 20, 1991, the plaintiffs seek various forms of relief for alleged infringement, and resulting loss, of the plaintiffs' exclusive rights under Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,275,349.
[2]
The plaintiff Merck & Co. Inc. (hereinafter "Merck") is a United States corporation organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey, where it has its principal place of business. It is the owner of the Canadian patent here in suit, issued on October 16, 1990. Merck Frosst Canada Inc. (hereinafter "Merck Frosst") is a corporation organized under the laws of the province of Ontario, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck, with its principal place of business in Quebec. Merck Frosst is the exclusive licensee in Canada of Merck under the patent.
[3]
The patent concerns amino acid derivatives, and it relates generally to carboxyalkyl dipeptides and derivatives thereof, said to be useful as converting enzyme inhibitors and as antihypertensives. The patent includes the claimed invention of certain compounds, among others, identified in this action by their generic names enalapril and enalapril maleate, developed through research undertaken by the plaintiff Merck. The latter compound, when combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier into tablets or liquid dosage form, provides a product, a composition, dispensed as a prescription drug to members of the public for treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The patent includes claims for the compounds, and claims for pharmaceutical compositions including the compounds, and claims for their use as antihypertensives.
[4]
After its introduction into the Canadian market in 1987, following the issue of a notice of compliance ("NOC") by Health and Welfare Canada authorizing sale in Canada, Merck Frosst's enalapril maleate, marketed under the trade name Vasotec, in four tablet strengths and in injectable liquid form, became a popular product. In 1993, with sales in excess of $150 million, it is said to have been the leading prescription product in sales value in Canada and it constituted almost one third of total sales by Merck Frosst's pharmaceutical division. On a worldwide basis, sales of the product by Merck and its subsidiaries are said to be the second most valuable prescription drug sold.
[5]
Apotex Inc., the defendant, is a manufacturer and distributor of generic pharmaceutical products. It is incorporated under the laws of Ontario, and its principal place of business is in Weston, Ontario. It has not sought, nor has it ever held, a license from Merck to import, manufacture, export or sell enalapril or enalapril maleate for use or consumption in Canada or anywhere else. Apotex manufactures and when this action began by statement of claim dated September 20, 1991, was said to have marketed abroad, as it has done in Canada since September 1993 when it received an NOC authorizing sale in this country, Apo-Enalapril, in tablets of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 milligram dosage forms. The tablets are generally similar in size, shape, colour and concentration of the compound enalapril maleate to the corresponding Vasotec tablets of Merck Frosst.
[6]
Prior to commencement of this action, in February 1990, Apotex applied to Health and Welfare Canada for an NOC to market in Canada its version of enalapril maleate under the trade name Apo-Enalapril. In its defence in this action Apotex claims to have acquired quantities of enalapril maleate, in bulk form as raw material, prior to the issuance on October 16, 1990, of Merck's patent in suit. By the end of 1992, anticipating the grant of an NOC in response to its application, Apotex had manufactured, from the bulk material it acquired, substantial quantities of its product in tablet form. When an NOC was not forthcoming, in late December 1992, Apotex applied for an order, in the nature of mandamus, to compel the Minister to issue that notice, in relation to Apo-Enalapril. Before that application was heard, the
Patent Act Amendment Act, 1992
, S.C. 1993, c. 2, came into force on February 4, 1993, extending the monopoly of exclusive use by the patent owner to a term of 20 years from the date of application. Under s. 55.2 of that
Act
, the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, SOR/93-133, were enacted in March 1993, significantly changing the arrangements for issue of an NOC where there is an existing patent for the same drug. In light of those changes then made or anticipated, in February 1993 Merck applied for an order to prohibit the Minister from issuing an NOC to Apotex for its Apo-Enalapril product.
[7]
That motion, together with the earlier Apotex motion for an order that an NOC be issued, was heard by my colleague Mr. Justice Dubé in June 1993 and in July he directed that an NOC issue and that the motion by Merck be dismissed. His Order was stayed by further Order of the Court pending consideration of an appeal by Merck to the Court of Appeal. That stay was also appealed. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of Apotex, dismissing the stay, and it dismissed Merck's appeal, thus upholding the Order of Dubé, J. In the result, an NOC issued to Apotex on September 2, 1993. Merck then applied for an interim and an interlocutory injunction to restrain Apotex from selling its Apo-Enalapril product pending trial of this action. While an injunction was refused, Apotex was ordered to maintain accounts of sales and shipments pending disposition of this action, and arrangements were made for an expedited trial in this matter, which occurred in March and April 1994.
Principal Conclusions
[8]
From trial of this action my main conclusions may be summarized as follows.
[9]
The action by the plaintiffs is to be allowed, for I find the defendant has infringed the plaintiffs' exclusive interests under the patent by manufacture of its Apo-Enalapril product and sale of the tablets so produced. The defence pursuant to s. 56 of the
Act
does not, in the circumstances of this case, provide immunity for those activities of the defendant and further, I am not persuaded that claims 8 to 17 of the patent are invalid, as the defendant pleads. Thus the counterclaim by the defendant is to be dismissed.
[10]
The plaintiffs are entitled to relief as more particularly described under the heading Conclusions and relief towards the end of these reasons.
The Background
[11]
It is useful to briefly describe the background circumstances of this case, about which there is no serious dispute. In the mid to late 1980's, Dr. Bernard Sherman, President of Apotex, who sought to keep abreast of potential developments of significance in relation to prescription drugs, was aware that Merck had developed enalapril and had obtained, in the United States, a patent for its invention of that product in October 1983. He also knew that in 1985 Merck was approved in the United States to market its Vasotec product containing enalapril maleate.
[12]
Although Merck Frosst originally applied for a patent in Canada in 1979, this was not apparently widely known. In 1983 it also submitted a new drug submission to National Health and Welfare in Canada and in July 1987 a notice of compliance was issued, permitting the sale of Merck Frosst's Vasotec product in Canada, and sales apparently commenced thereafter. Still, no patent had issued in Canada at the time when the NOC was issued. The Merck Frosst patent application was amended in 1986, and subsequently the Canadian Patent was issued on October 16, 1990.
[13]
From his understanding of the promise of enalapril and enalapril maleate in treatment of hypertension, Dr. Sherman believed it would be, as he described it, "a blockbuster", that is, a product with a very substantial market and a significant prospect of a large financial return. It was a product that interested him and his company. In the ordinary course, as it did in relation to other prescription drugs, Apotex might well have sought a compulsory license under the
Patent Act
as it then was, but that route was not possible until the plaintiffs' enalapril was the subject of a patent in Canada. Dr. Sherman also testified that when Apotex began its work in development of Apo-Enalapril in the mid 1980's, he was aware of discussion of possible changes in the
Patent Act
, to extend the exclusive rights of the patentee and to postpone or abandon the compulsory licensing arrangements which then prevailed, and to provide protection for product claims in medicines without simultaneously claiming the process for production of the medicines at least in the case of chemical products.
[14]
In these circumstances, Apotex arranged to purchase enalapril maleate in bulk form, which evidence at trial established it was manufactured in Canada by Delmar Chemicals for the most part prior to the issuance of the Merck patent. Dr. Sherman believes that having done so Apotex may use that product, in the way it was intended for use, without being liable to Merck for so doing, in accord with s. 56 of the
Act
. In bulk form the product may be maintained, under appropriate conditions, for a very long time. In tablet form it is considered to have a relatively brief shelf life, of about two years. Apotex managed to formulate its Apo-Enalapril tablets in early 1991, after some difficulty. It had applied in February 1990 for an NOC to market its product in Canada, an application granted in September 1993 in accord with the Order of Mr. Justice Dubé, referred to earlier. Before that notice was granted, in 1991 it had begun to sell its Apo-Enalapril abroad, in the Caribbean, and its product was advertised by others for sale by mail order in the United States. Those early efforts to sell abroad led to the filing of the statement of claim in this action.
[15]
Since September 2, 1993, Apotex has begun marketing its product in Canada under the NOC authorizing those sales. The parties have conducted a major campaign from early summer of 1993, seeking to influence provincial governments in their decisions concerning listing of the defendant's products in provincial prescription drug formularies, and to influence pharmacists in dispensing decisions.
Issues
[16]
The plaintiffs claim relief for alleged infringement of their exclusive patent interests. They seek a declaration that certain claims in the patent have been infringed by the defendant, i.e. the compound claims 1-5, the pharmaceutical composition claims 8-10, and claims to the use of the compounds as antihypertensives, claims 11-15. They seek an injunction restraining any further infringement.
[17]
They seek damages or an accounting of profits as the plaintiffs may elect. By Order of my colleague Madame Justice Tremblay-Lamer, on consent, questions concerning the extent of any infringement of the plaintiffs' rights, and the damages arising therefrom or the profits arising from any infringement, may be determined after this trial by reference under rule 500 et seq. A claim to exemplary or punitive damages, included in plaintiffs' statement of claim, was withdrawn by counsel for the plaintiffs at trial.
[18]
Other relief sought by plaintiffs includes delivery up or destruction of all compositions of defendant that infringe the patent, interest on damages or profits both before and after judgment, and costs.
[19]
For the defendants it is urged that the plaintiffs' action be dismissed. While the validity of the compound claims 1-5 is not contested for purposes of this action, the defendant pleads that its product containing enalapril maleate was produced from bulk product made in Canada prior to the grant of Merck's patent and that s. 56 of the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, as amended, (the "
Act
"), provides a defence to the plaintiffs' claim of infringement. As it turns out on the evidence adduced, the defendant also acquired a lot or shipment of bulk enalapril maleate from a foreign purchaser that acquired the bulk product from Delmar Chemicals after Delmar had acquired a compulsory license and produced the bulk material before its license was effectively terminated by the 1993 amendments to the
Patent Act
.
[20]
In addition to its immunity from liability under s. 56, by its defence Apotex contends that the composition and use claims of the plaintiff Merck's patent, claims 8-17, are invalid on several grounds. Thus, it is submitted the composition claims 8-10, incorporating the compounds claimed, but no further inventive step are invalid, that the discovery claimed is for a medical treatment and is not for an invention as defined in the
Act
so that claims 8-17 are invalid, or that they are invalid because they do not comply with s. 34 of the
Act
. I note that is more claims than Merck here seeks to protect. By counterclaim, a declaration is sought by the defendant, that claims 8 to 17 of the patent are each invalid or void, and costs of the counterclaim are sought on a solicitor and client basis.
[21]
I deal first with the construction of the patent. In view of the pleadings and the issues left for trial, construing the patent in this case is intended merely to provide sufficient understanding to deal with the question of infringement and validity in light of the defences raised to the plaintiffs' claims, which defences raise issues that are primarily issues of law.
[22]
Then I turn to the determination of infringement at least on a prima facie basis, and the issues whether s. 56 of the
Act
provides a full defence to the plaintiffs' claim, or a partial defence, or none at all, on the facts of this case. If s. 56 provides a full defence that would resolve the matter of the plaintiffs' claims, but if it provides no defence or a partial defence only, and in order to deal with the defendant's counterclaim, the challenge by Apotex to the validity of claims 8-17 must be determined. If those claims are valid it is necessary then to conclude, in light of the earlier determination of infringement whether any of the claims 8 to 10 and 11 to 15 have been infringed by the defendant, as the plaintiffs contend.
[23]
Finally, in light of the resolution of issues raised, the relief claimed and its appropriateness in the circumstances of this case require brief examination by way of conclusion.
Construing The Patent
[24]
The claims of Canadian Patent 1,275,349 which are at issue in this action include claims 1-5, and 8-17. In the last group of claims, 8-17, I note again that the plaintiffs' claims of infringement by the defendant are limited to claims 8 to 10 and 11 to 15, referred to in argument respectively as "composition claims" and "use claims", but in its defence and by its counterclaim, Apotex alleges invalidity also of the use claims 16 and 17 of the patent.
[25]
The claims in issue are set out in the patent as follows.
"1. A compound of the formula:
[See printed version]
wherein:
R is lower alkoxy;
R
1
is a substituted lower alkyl wherein the substituent is phenyl;
R
2
and R
7
are hydrogen;
R
3
, R
4
and R
5
are lower alkyl;
R
4
and R
5
may be connected together to form an alkylene bridge of from 2 to 4 carbon atoms;
R
6
is hydroxy;
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
"2. The N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline.
"3. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline.
"4. The N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline maleate salt.
"5. The N-(1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline.
. . . . .
"8. A pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising an effective amount of a compound of Claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

"15. The use of N-(1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline as an antihypertensive.
"16. The use of N-(1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline amide as an antihypertensive.
"17. The use of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl-L-alanyl-L-prolinate hydrochloride as an antihypertensive."
[26]
Aside from the defendant's submission that claims 8-17 are invalid because as written they do not meet requirements of the
Patent Act
, construing the patent and its claims is not an issue in the usual sense. In the circumstances it is not inappropriate for resolution of the issues raised in this case to rely on the construction of the claims as described by Dr. Arthur A. Patchett, in his affidavit as an expert witness, although he testified in that capacity for the plaintiffs, and also as a fact witness. Dr. Patchett is one of four Merck staff members listed as inventors in the patent in suit. A research chemist, he is currently Vice-President, Exploratory Chemistry, of Merck, working in the company's laboratories at Rahway, New Jersey. His description of the specification of the patent, which I set out as an acceptable construction for consideration of the issues here raised, was not challenged in cross-examination. Nor were his conclusions challenged, about infringement by Apotex's products, assuming the validity of the patent claims. His construction of the patent is as follows, together with his conclusions about infringement.
"23. Without going into detail on the structure or synthesis, Enalapril is a compound whose formula is specified by the chemical name:
N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline.
"24. Enalapril Maleate is prepared by adding maleic acid to Enalapril or to a diastereomeric mixture containing Enalapril to form the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, Enalapril Maleate.
"25. Enalapril in the form of its stable salt, Enalapril Maleate, when taken orally in tablet form, is absorbed largely through the lining of the small intestine into the blood stream and is then converted principally by the liver into the diacid, Enalaprilat, which acts as the ACE inhibitor leading to the indicated reductions in blood pressure.
"26. Enalapril Maleate is a much more stable compound than Enalapril and it is this salt which is used in making tablets and capsules for oral administration to patients.
. . . . .
"34. The four bottles of Apo-Enalapril® tablets, the 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg size, are now shown to me and marked Exhibit 'F' to this my affidavit.
. . . . .
"35. Also now shown to me and marked Exhibit 'G' to this my affidavit is a bottle containing what I understand and have assumed to be bulk Enalapril Maleate powder. I have examined this powder and, while I have not made a chemical analysis of it, it does appear to be what is marked on its label.
"36. I have been referred to claims 1 to 5 of Canadian Patent 1,275,349 and have been asked to give my opinion as to whether the Enalapril Maleate, in bulk form as we see in Exhibit 'G', or contained in tablet form as we see in Exhibit 'F', is within the chemical and pharmaceutical compound formulations set forth in those claims.
"37. Claim 1 describes a class of compounds as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the recited compounds.
"38. In my opinion, Enalapril falls within the class of compounds of claim 1 and Enalapril Maleate is one of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds.
"39. In order for the compounds of claim 1 to specifically read on Enalapril, R would be ethoxy which is a lower alkoxy; R
1
would be phenylethyl which is a substituted lower alkyl wherein the substituent is phenyl; R
2
and R
7
would be hydrogen; R
3
would be a methyl and R
4
and R
5
would be connected together to form an alkylene bridge of a total of three carbon atoms, and R
6
would be hydroxy.
"40. Accordingly, the compounds of claim 1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include, within the genus of that claim, Enalapril as a compound and Enalapril Maleate as the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, whether in bulk form or as the active ingredient in Merck Frosst's Vasotec® and Apotex's Apo-Enalapril® tablets.
"41. Claim 2 recites the specific chemical name and, thereby, the formula for Enalapril, which was found to be one of the most orally active species within the genus of claim 1. Enalapril Maleate is the Maleate salt of Enalapril and salt formation has no effect on the chemical identity of the Enalapril constituent. Accordingly, the chemical formula specified in claim 2 is encompassed by the Enalapril Maleate salt.
"42. Claim 3 recites the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of Enalapril. It will be noted that the chemical name which specifies Enalapril in claim 3 is identical to that in claim 2. Claim 3 does not limit the salt to maleate salt. It can be any pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. In the case we are concerned with here, the maleate salt of Enalapril, namely: Enalapril Maleate, is clearly a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt and thus it falls squarely within the wording of claim 3.
"43. Claim 4 recites the specific chemical name and, thereby, formula for Enalapril Maleate and thus Apotex's Enalapril Maleate tablets, as well as the bulk Enalapril Maleate material, fall squarely within the wording of claim 4.
"44. Claim 5 recites a name for what can be described as the diastereomeric mixture of the more active and the less active diastereomers of Enalapril. The more active diastereomer is known as the S-diastereomer as named in claim 2 and that is the Enalapril used by Merck and Apotex in their tablets. Thus, Enalapril Maleate falls squarely within the chemical name and, thereby, formula of claim 5.
. . . . .
"46. Claim 8, as can be seen, is a claim to a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising an effective amount of a compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The Apo-Enalapril® tablets comprise an effective amount of a compound of claim 1, namely: Enalapril and its salt, Enalapril Maleate, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier being the carrier Apotex is using in its tablet. The tablets are indicated to be used for the treatment of hypertension. Thus, in my opinion, the Apo-Enalapril® tablets fall squarely within the wording of claim 8.
. . . . .
"47. Claim 9 also recites a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising an effective amount of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline which is Enalapril in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Since Enalapril Maleate is the maleate salt of Enalapril for the reasons stated in paragraph 24 hereof, in my opinion, the Apo-Enalapril® tablets fall squarely within the wording of claim 9.
"48. Claim 10 recites a pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension, comprising an effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl-L-alanyl-L-proline which is Enalapril in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As the maleate salt is a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of Enalapril, this claim describes precisely the Apo-Enalapril® tablets as a pharmaceutical composition comprising Enalapril Maleate in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for intended use in reducing hypertension.
"49. Claims 11 to 15 describe the use of Enalapril as a antihypertensive including the generic compounds of claim 1 (including Enalapril) as an antihypertensive (claim 11), the specific use of Enalapril as an antihypertensive (claim 12), the use of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of Enalapril (including Enalapril Maleate) as an antihypertensive (claim 13), the specific use of the Enalapril Maleate salt as an antihypertensive (claim 14), and the use of the R and S diastereomeric mixture, which includes Enalapril, as an antihypertensive (claim 15).
"50. In my opinion, the language of all claims 11 to 15, either generally or specifically, recite the use of Enalapril and Enalapril Maleate as an antihypertensive which is an intended use for the Apo-Enalapril® tablets that are offered for sale and sold by Apotex Inc., the Defendant in this action."
[27]
I add to this description my own brief reference to claims 16 and 17 which are included in the Apotex counterclaim. Those two claims, in my view, are simply use claims, parallel in scope and structure to claims 11 to 15, but with relation not to enalapril maleate but rather, in claim 16 to an amide, as claimed in claim 6, for use as an antihypertensive, and in claim 17 to a hydrochloride, as claimed in claim 7, for use as an antihypertensive. Since there is no evidence or claim that Apotex is using an amide or a hydrochloride of enalapril, claims 6 and 7 were not alleged by the plaintiffs to be infringed. In these circumstances it is appropriate to consider the validity of claims 16 and 17 only in the context of the defendant's counterclaim.
Apo-Enalapril And The
Plaintiffs' Patent Claims
[28]
The defendant admits that its Apo-Enalapril tablets contain enalapril maleate, essentially in similar concentrations to that in the plaintiff Merck Frosst's comparable Vasotec tablets. As noted, Apotex, for purposes of this action, does not challenge the validity of compound claims 1 to 5 of the patent, though it is otherwise for composition claims 8 to 10, and for use claims 11 to 17, which by its defence and its counterclaim Apotex asserts are invalid claims.
[29]
In his evidence, which was not challenged in this regard in cross-examination, Dr. Patchett as an expert witness made clear his opinion that, aside from any defences it might have, Apotex by its Apo-Enalapril tablets was infringing the claims of Merck's patent. He set out his opinion in his affidavit in chief, as set out above in the paragraphs quoted. As we have seen, his opinion is that the bulk enalapril maleate or the Apo-Enalapril tablets of the defendant are clearly within the wording of claim 1 (para. 40, supra), claim 2 (para. 41), claim 3 (para. 42), claim 4 (para. 43), claim 5 (para. 44), claim 8 (para. 46), claim 9 (para. 47), claim 10 (para. 48), claims 11 to 15 (paras. 49, 50). He sums up his opinion in para. 51, as follows:
"51. In conclusion, it is my opinion that the Apo-Enalapril tablets of Apotex Inc., containing a formulation of the chemical compound Enalapril Maleate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and intended for use as an antihypertensive, fall squarely within the language of claims 1 to 5 inclusive and 8 to 15 inclusive of Patent 1,275,349 and the Enalapril Maleate compound itself as a raw material in bulk form falls squarely within the language of claims 1 to 5 inclusive of Patent 1,275,349."
[30]
Dr. Patchett's opinion was confirmed by his testimony and that is not directly challenged by the defendant Apotex, which defends against the plaintiffs' claims of infringement on legal grounds, to which I now turn.
[31]
In these circumstances, on the evidence at trial, subject to consideration of the defences and counterclaim of Apotex, I find that, prima facie, the defendant has infringed the exclusive rights of the plaintiffs under claims 1 to 5 and 8 to 15 set out in the patent in suit.
Section 56 As A General Defence
[32]
The defendant contends that it is entitled under s. 56 of the
Act
to use and sell its Apo-Enalapril product on the basis that it is simply using and selling enalapril maleate made in Canada that it purchased or acquired before the issue of the plaintiff Merck's patent on October 16, 1990.
[33]
That claim is disputed by the plaintiffs on the ground that s. 56 does not apply in the circumstances of this case even if the defendant obtained bulk product manufactured prior to the issue of the patent, for it was only after the patent issued that it produced its own product by further manufacturing, producing its tablets. Further, the plaintiffs submit that s. 56 provides no defence in relation to three lots of bulk enalapril maleate, which the plaintiffs contend were not in existence before the issue of the patent on October 16, 1990, because those lots required refinishing or purification of the product by the supplier after the issue of the patent and before delivery to Apotex. Finally, it is urged that the defendant is estopped by its conduct, or that of its President, from claiming s. 56 as a defence.
[34]
The statutory provision in question is substantially one of longstanding but its application to the circumstances here does not appear to have been previously determined at trial.
[35]
I note that argument in this case was related to the text of s. 56 as it was prior to amendment in 1987 and under that wording the stipulated time for purchase, construction or acquisition of the invention was before the issuing of the patent, rather than the date when "an application for a patent becomes open to the inspection of the public", as the section now provides. In my view, that makes no difference in the circumstances here, where the patent application was pending when the amendment came into force and under the regime applying before the amendment the application would not, in the ordinary course, have been open to inspection of the public before grant of the patent.
[36]
For purposes of these reasons I use the phrase "before the issue of the patent", as counsel did at trial, to refer to the relevant time of acquisition of a matter subsequently patented in order for the immunity from suit to apply under s. 56.
[37]
Section 56 of the
Act
as amended S.C. 1987, c. 41, (R.S.C. 1985, c. 33 (3rd Supp)) s. 22 now provides:
"56. Every person who, before an application for a patent becomes open to the inspection of the public under s. 10, has purchased, constructed or acquired the invention for which a patent is afterwards obtained under this Act has the right to use and sell to others the specific article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter patented and so purchased, constructed or acquired without being liable to the patentee or the legal representatives of the patentee for so doing, but the patent shall not, with respect to other persons, be held invalid by reason of that purchase, construction or acquisition or use of the invention by the person first mentioned, or by those to whom that person has sold it, unless it was purchased, constructed, acquired or used for a longer period than two years before the application for a patent therefor, in consequence whereof the invention was disclosed in such a manner that it became available to the public in Canada or elsewhere."
[38]
Most of the enalapril maleate acquired by the defendant, a substantial quantity, reached it, on delivery by the supplier, before the grant of the patent to Merck. The first lot was supplied by Delmar Chemicals, through Torcan Chemicals, both Canadian companies, in August 1987. As noted certain lots or shipments were received, after refinishing or remanufacturing was completed, following issue of the patent to Merck. In regard to the bulk product purchased or acquired by Apotex before October 16, 1990, Merck submits that Apotex's rights to use or sell the "specific" product so obtained, pursuant to s. 56, do not extend to the right to manufacture tablets from the bulk product or to sell the product in its tablet form.
[39]
The plaintiffs urge that to establish a defence under s. 56 the defendant must demonstrate that "the article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter" that is the subject of the invention and which it subsequently uses or sells, is the specific one it acquired prior to issue of the patent, that is, that it is the very same article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter. Here the defendant acquired enalapril maleate in bulk form prior to issue of the patent, and after the grant of the patent it processed some of that bulk material into tablets by a manufacturing process. While s. 56 may authorize the use or sale of the bulk product, the plaintiffs urge the section ought not to extend to authorize its processing, and the production of a new and different product for sale. That new different product, the Apo-Enalapril tablets, the plaintiff urges, was not in existence when Merck obtained its patent.
[40]
The defendant submits that s. 56 assures its right to use, without restriction, the product subsequently patented, at least in the manner intended by the invention to which the patent refers, in short to use it in the same way the inventor may. Otherwise, it is said in a case such as this the exception from the exclusive rights of the patentee which s. 56 provides would be hollow indeed, for here no use for the bulk product is suggested other than the "downstream" use of incorporating the product into a pharmaceutical prescription drug for purposes of marketing for use as an antihypertensive.
[41]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at 163, Gibson, J., commented in regard to then s. 58, now s. 56, of the
Act
:
"For a person to obtain the immunity given by s. 58, the person can only use or vend to others 'the specific article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter patented and so purchased, constructed or acquired before the issue of the patent therefor'.
"It would appear that the key word in s. 58 is 'specific' ... ."
[42]
In that case, as in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 223; 14 D.L.R.(3d) 210, upon which Gibson, J., relied in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the court was concerned with the application of then s. 58, now s. 56, claimed as a defence in an action for infringement arising from use of patented apparatus or machinery. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the protected use was said to be the use of machinery for laminating polyurethane foam and another fabric, but the defendant did not establish that any machine, comparable to patented machinery used by it for production of the laminated product, was in existence at the time the patent in suit issued. The defendant at sometime had three machines. The first, acquired prior to the issue of the patent and subsequently modified, was destroyed before the action; the second, constructed by defendant from parts purchased at auction was not proven to have been made or used by it prior to the issue of the patent, and the third, was built by the defendant some years after the issuance of the patent.
[43]
Those circumstances give meaning to Gibson, J.'s, comment in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, and further at p. 164, that
"Counsel for the defendant submitted that this court, in respect to the subject matter of this case, should construe s. 58 of the
Patent Act
so as to find that the words 'specific article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter' are synonymous with the words 'unrestricted royalty free licence to use invention'. In other words, the word 'specific' if such submission was to be accepted, is in effect deleted ... ."
That construction he rejected in dismissing the defendant's claim to immunity under then s. 58 for use of the invention for production of the laminated product from its machines numbers two and three.
[44]
In the
Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass
case, then s. 58 was claimed as a defence to an action for infringement alleged in the use of machinery, subsequently the subject of a patent, which used a patented process, for laminating curved windshield glass. The machine was acquired prior to the issue of the patent, the specific machine was used in the same manner after as before the patent issued, and the immunity from suit provided by then s. 58 was recognized by the Supreme Court.
[45]
The defendant urges that under s. 56 of the
Act
, having acquired the patented drug product here in issue, enalapril maleate, in bulk form prior to the issue of Merck's patent, it is entitled to use that for the only use known, the use for which it was intended by the patentee, that is, to be incorporated in tablets or other formulation for sale as prescription medicine. I return to this in considering the defendant's position after brief reference to other cases referred to by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs urge reliance upon comments of Walsh, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at 152. for the principle that s. 56, "must be strictly construed and restrictively interpreted". That case also concerned the use of machinery, acquired prior to issue of the plaintiff's patent on similar machinery and it involved a motion for summary judgment, not a trial. Walsh, J.'s, comments must be read in the context of the state of the pleadings and the nature of the proceedings. He did there construe strictly s. 58, as it then was, in circumstances where the parties disagreed on its application to the facts alleged in the pleadings.
[46]
In
Teledyne Industries Inc. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 29 (F.C.A.), at 38. Thurlow, C.J., said:
"It should be noted at this point that the right preserved by s. 58 for a person who qualifies for its protection is simply to 'use' and 'sell'. No right is reserved to exercise the other exclusive rights conferred by the patent to 'make' or 'construct' the invention."
Plaintiffs submit that on this basis the defendant had no right to manufacture tablets in the case at bar, essentially because the tablets (i.e., the Apo-Enalapril, Apotex's product in tablet form) was not in existence at the date the patent issued. I am not persuaded that the words of Thurlow, C.J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> were intended to apply to the facts of this case as perceived by plaintiffs. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was concerned with showerheads purchased abroad before they were patented in Canada, and Thurlow, C.J., would have extended the immunity from suit under then s. 58 to all of the product provided under the contract concluded before the date of issue of the patent, including those showerheads not established to be in existence or acquired at that time. In this context it seems to me his reference to making or constructing the invention must concern replicating more of the invented product than was acquired prior to the issue of the patent. In this case Apotex makes no claim to a right to produce more enalapril maleate, rather it claims only the right to use that quantity acquired prior to the issue of Merck's patent by formulating that into tablets for prescription medicine.
[47]
In that same case,
Libbey-Owens-Ford
, Urie, J.A., speaking for himself and Kelly, D.J., excluded from protection under then s. 58, any showerhead not established to be in existence before the grant of the patent. He said, at p. 54:
"Clearly s. 58 applies to a person other than the patentee who uses or sells an article or machine after the grant of patent. In this case the critical date is December 14, 1976. It must thus be determined as at that date, whether or not the specific articles or machines which the appellant used or sold were articles or machines that it purchased, constructed or acquired before the grant of patent. It is my view that because of its evident purpose s. 58 contemplates that the particular articles or machines must actually be in existence at the date of the grant to fall within its purview. As I see it, their actual existence at that date is essential to the application of the section."
[48]
Counsel made reference to only one case involving s. 56 and its application in circumstances somewhat similar to those here arising, where the patent concerned pharmaceutical medicines.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), the court was dealing with a motion to compel Apotex Inc. to file a further and better statement of legal and factual grounds for its allegation of noninfringement of a patent relating to the product Lisinopril, under the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
. As in the case at bar, Apotex there asserted that it was entitled to use and sell Lisinopril purchased in bulk prior to the grant of the patent and subsequently to use that bulk product to produce pharmaceutical compositions in dosage form for sale. After referring to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and the comments of Urie, J.A., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , my colleague Nadon, J., said:
"Based on these authorities, it is therefore my view that Apotex may only sell or use the specific 'article' which it purchased prior to the issuance of the subject patents.
"Consequently, Apotex may only use and sell to others the Lisinopril which it purchased in the form in which it was purchased. It is my view that s. 56 does not permit Apotex to use or sell its Lisinopril in a form other than that in which it was purchased. The clear words of s. 56 leave no doubt in my mind that it must be so."
[49]
The defendant urges that the comments of Nadon, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , are dicta, since the case was not a trial, no facts were proven, full argument was not addressed to the construction of s. 56 and, it is contended, it was unnecessary for determination of the main issue to rule on the construction of s. 56 which, it is said, ought to have been left to the judge ultimately hearing the substantive application for judicial review in that case. The defendant urges that Nadon, J., was concerned with assessing the adequacy of "pleadings", that is, the written statements called notices of allegation required in the process established under the
Regulations
.
[50]
I note that the Court of Appeal in a recent decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), concluded that a notice of allegation is not a document filed with the court and it is beyond the reach of the court's jurisdiction in a judicial review proceeding to strike out that notice. In effect, this may put in question, for another reason, the comments of Mr. Justice Nadon since  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Pharma
the issue before him concerned the adequacy of the notice of allegation in that case, with no question raised concerning the jurisdiction of the court to consider the matter. In these circumstances, I consider the interpretation to be given to s. 56 on the basis of the arguments addressed to that issue at trial, without reliance upon
Zeneca Pharma
as a precedent to be accorded deference other than its persuasive value.
[51]
The defendant, as noted earlier, relies upon the section itself and its obvious purpose to protect the common law right to use and sell any article, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter that is not, when it is acquired, the subject of exclusive rights in some other party by virtue of a valid patent. It urges that if the use here made of the product acquired and later included within the Merck patent, i.e., the enalapril maleate in bulk form, to produce tablets, is not protected by s. 56 then that section has different application in the case of chemical and pharmaceutical products intended for use as prescription medicines than it has for other products. It would seem the section would not permit use of the product, that is the bulk product, in the only manner it could be used in this case, or in the manner contemplated by the patentee. In the case of other articles, machinery and so on, there is no question that their use in the manner intended by the patentee is permitted by s. 56 for one who acquires the article before the issue of the patent.
[52]
There can be no doubt that when it acquired the enalapril maleate in bulk form, prior to the issuance of the patent to Merck, s. 56 thereafter provided immunity from claims to infringement of Merck's patent for the use and sale of the product in that form. Did that immunity also extend to protect Apotex where, after the grant of the patent, it manufactured, or altered the form of the patented product, earlier acquired, by a manufacturing process, and produced tablets which it claims can be sold, with immunity under s. 56?
[53]
I accept, in part on the evidence of Dr. McClelland, one of the expert witnesses called by Apotex, that the basic patented compound here in issue, enalapril maleate, is, in chemical terms, produced in molecules, all identical, with the chemical structure described in the patent. That compound found in the bulk form is unchanged during each step in the tabletting process used by Apotex and it continues to exist in the same chemical form in the tablets as in the bulk form. Dr. McClelland conceded that in another sense the form of the product is changed by the tabletting process by which other ingredients are added to make use of the patented product as a prescription drug, even if, as he avowed, the active ingredient in the tablet, the enalapril maleate, remains unchanged chemically within the tablet. The two forms are, of course, very different. The product in bulk form is whitish, granular or coarse powder, without other form or shape, comprised, exclusively within acceptable limits for purity, of molecules of enalapril maleate. In tablet form it appears, with other tablet ingredients, coloured and shaped in a form associated with a particular dosage, and the enalapril maleate is but a small part of the entire tablet form.
[54]
In essence it is the defendant's submission that the right to "use", is a substantive right distinct from the right to "sell", under s. 56, and it extends to using the article for that purpose for which it was intended. It is urged that nothing in s. 56 itself restricts the use which may be made of the "article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter" acquired before the grant of the patent in suit. In particular it is urged, as earlier noted on the authority of
Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass
, that if the article could not be put to the only use for which it is intended or is usable, without liability for infringement, then s. 56 would provide no worthwhile protection for the person who acquired the invention prior to the issue of the patent.
[55]
That view is based on a perception of the nature of the invention, primarily that of a chemist as described by Dr. McClelland, which in essence sees the invention as comprising a molecule described by a chemical formula. There is, in my view, another perception of the invention that is to be borne in mind here. That perception is one described by the terms of the patent, which claims more than a molecule with a chemical formula. Rather, the claims describe several or many compounds, and several compositions, and specific uses for them, all aspects of the same invention. Enalapril may be the essence of each claim, but the claims, and the patent for the invention, are more than the chemical molecule of enalapril or of enalapril maleate.
[56]
In my view the approach of Thurlow, J., as he then was  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -Owens-Ford Glass
, at trial in the Exchequer Court, is of assistance here in seeking to construe s. 56. He said, in part about then s. 58. now s. 56:
"In the view I take the proper approach to the interpretation of s. 58 is to first read its wording, coupled with that of s. 2(d), [the definition of 'invention' under the statute as it then was, now included in s. 2(1)], in an effort to ascertain its meaning therefrom ... ."
That approach is quoted at length and its conclusion in that case was endorsed by Hall, J., for the Supreme Court of Canada, in dismissing the appeal from Thurlow, J. In so doing Hall, J., said in part at 62 C.P.R.(2d) 223 at p. 229-230:
"The extent of the protection afforded by s. 58 of the
Patent Act
is described by the words 'the right of using and vending [now expressed as "the right to use and sell"] to others the specific article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter patented and so purchased, constructed or acquired before the issue of the patent therefor ...'
"The question in this case is with respect to the extent of the meaning of 'using' and it arises because with respect to 'vending' the right of the owner of the specific machine or other thing is expressed as that of vending it, not as that of vending its output. However, it is obvious that in the case of a machine designed for the production of goods, there would really be no worthwhile protection allowed by s. 58 if the owner could not put it to the only use for which it is usable without being liable for infringement."
[57]
In
Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co.
Mr. Justice Thurlow's approach led him to review in considerable detail the wording of then s. 58 (see 57 C.P.R. at 181-186). After that review he writes (at 184-185):
"On this analysis of s. 58 I am accordingly inclined to the opinion that the words 'article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter patented' are broad enough by themselves to embrace anything whether tangible or intangible which is patentable as an invention and that the scope of what the person referred to in s. 58 may use and sell is limited only by the adjective 'specific' and the subsequent expression 'so purchased, constructed or acquired before the issue of the patent therefor'. The effect of these words, as I see it, in respect to an 'article' whether tangible or intangible, is to limit the use that may be made of the patented subject matter to use of the specific item of patented subject matter acquired before the patent issued.
"While the section is worded somewhat clumsily, its meaning in this view would come to this:
'58. Every person who, before the issuing of a patent has purchased, constructed or acquired
any invention
[
i.e., any new
or useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter] for which a patent is afterwards obtained under this Act, has the right of using and vending to others the specific [
thing
] patented and so purchased, constructed or acquired before the issue of the patent therefor ..." (Italics added by Thurlow, J.)
[58]
In the Supreme Court decision, Hall, J., did not endorse Thurlow, J.'s, interpretation of the word "article" in the definition of invention, but he endorsed Thurlow, J.'s, approach in seeking to construe the words of s. 58 as the foundation for his conclusion. Thurlow, J.'s, paraphrasing of then s. 58 seems to me to be helpful in clarifying that the immunity granted under the section, in the circumstances of this case, would extend to Apotex, having acquired the invention, i.e., the composition of matter, enalapril maleate in its bulk form before the patent issued to Merck, the rights to use and sell to others the specific composition of matter "patented and so acquired". The specific matter patented and acquired in this case is enalapril maleate in bulk form. That may be used and sold in that form. In my view, it goes beyond the purpose intended by the words of s. 56 to extend the immunity, as Apotex urges should be done, to permit it to use the specific composition of matter, as intended by the inventor for the bulk form, to produce a product in another form, containing the patented composition of matter and to sell to others the new and different form in which the matter has been prepared by Apotex for a use claimed within the Merck patent.
[59]
I am inclined to this view, by the words of s. 56 which provide that the grant of a patent is not to affect the right of a person, who has acquired "the invention" before the issuing of the patent, to use and to sell to others "the specific composition of matter patented and so acquired". Here the invention claimed under the patent is enalapril in a variety of aspects, represented by various compounds and compositions, for the use claimed. It is that invention in the aspect of the compound enalapril maleate in bulk form which was here acquired by Apotex. That form of the composition of matter subsequently patented is what the defendant acquired prior to the issue of the Merck patent. To use that composition of matter, even as intended by the inventor, to produce a composition that is in the form of a prescription medicine which includes some of that matter with other ingredients, which combination may also be an aspect of the invention within a different form, for the use claimed in the patent, is in my view to go beyond the words "the specific ... composition of matter patented and so purchased". In my opinion, to sell the composition of matter in the new and different form resulting from Apotex's own tabletting process goes beyond the immunity granted by s. 56. It extends the right to sell to a composition of matter now in a form or aspect of the invention different from that which was acquired prior to the grant of the patent to Merck. It may be that if Apotex had perfected its tablet product and produced Apo-Enalapril in tablet form so that its use of the bulk product was developed before grant of the patent to Merck its immunity from suit under s. 56 might extend to all tablets whenever produced, before or after the patent issued, but that is not the case here and is not here determined.
[60]
My conclusion on this point is that use by Apotex to produce pharmaceutical tablets for the use claimed by Merck's patent, and sale by Apotex to others of Apo-Enalapril in tablet form, produced by it after the grant of Merck's patent from bulk enalapril maleate acquired prior to the issue of the patent on October 16, 1990, is not protected under s. 56 of the
Act
from claims for infringement by the plaintiffs.
Section 56 And Purchase Or Acquisition
Of The Invention Before Issuance Of
The Patent
[61]
In the event I am wrong in my conclusion about the general application of s. 56, I turn to the application of s. 56 in relation to particular shipments of enalapril maleate in bulk form, about which the parties have different perceptions of when the product in those shipments came into existence. Both parties accept the principle enunciated by Urie, J.A.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Industrial Products
(1981), 39 N.R. 561; 57 C.P.R.(2d) 29 (F.C.A.), at p. 54 (C.P.R.):
"... It is my view that because of its evident purpose s. 58 [now s. 56] contemplates that the particular articles or machines must actually be in existence at the date of the grant to fall within its purview. As I see it, their actual existence at that date is essential to the application of the section. ..."
In that case, as we have already noted, showerheads purchased abroad before the date of issue of a Canadian patent, were found to be within the purview of now s. 56 where before grant of the patent they had been received by the buyer in Canada, or had been shipped by the foreign supplier in accord with the contract of purchase prior to the issuance of the patent. But showerheads not so shipped, and subsequently received by the buyer in Canada, were not within the purview of s. 56 in the absence of evidence that they were in existence before the patent issued.
[62]
Here, the plaintiffs accept that enalapril maleate in bulk form, shipped to and received by the defendant by October 16, 1990, or packaged by the manufacturer Delmar and finally allocated to Apotex' purchase before but not shipped until after that date is within the meaning of the words "purchased ... or acquired" within s. 56. Yet there are certain lots which the plaintiffs say were not purchased or acquired at the requisite time.
[63]
Manufacture of these lots was commenced by Delmar in September 1990, lots originally identified by Delmar as lots numbered P-65478, P-65479, P-65480. In all three cases the product was packaged by Delmar in September 1990, but subsequently was found by the company's quality control staff not to meet Delmar's quality standards for purity. In each case the lot was reprocessed or refinished by suspension in water, heating with agitation, cooling, centrifuging and washing with water and ethyl acetate. For Apotex it is submitted that when the enalapril maleate was originally produced as a wet batch, even before drying, the enalapril maleate is produced and in existence. None is created by drying and pulverizing the product. If the lot contains undesirable products the process of purification, as undertaken in these three cases, is said not to be a manufacturing step since it does not produce any new enalapril maleate, indeed it may result in some loss of the product. On this view, Apotex urges that the enalapril maleate in these three lots was in existence on October 16, 1990 even though it was not refinished or purified and dried, tested and found to meet acceptable standards of the manufacturer until after that date, when it was packaged for delivery to Apotex.
[64]
That argument is said to have particular significance in the case of lot P-65478, which when refinished was identified by lot P-65541 and the refinishing wet solid obtained and placed in a dryer on October 10, 1990, the latest date at which the enalapril maleate could be said to be in existence under the Apotex view. That view invites acceptance of a chemical process perspective for purposes of assessing the nature of the invention claimed.
[65]
That may be an appropriate description of the chemical processes here followed. Nevertheless, I am persuaded, as the plaintiffs submit, that the enalapril maleate delivered to Apotex in these three lots could not be said to be in existence for purposes of the statutory immunity until the product was considered by Delmar to be of such a quality that the manufacturer would ship it under the contract for purchase by Apotex. Only when it was deemed to be of proper quality could it be considered to be purchased or acquired by Apotex within the meaning of s. 56. Since it was not judged by the supplier in these cases to be of that quality until after the issue of the patent to Merck in mid-October 1990, each of those lots of bulk enalapril maleate could not be said to be in existence at that date.
[66]
Thus, on the authority of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the immunity under s. 56 of the
Act
does not extend to provide immunity, from claims to infringement, for any use or sale of the product obtained in bulk in those three shipments, whether the use or sale be in bulk or tablet form, if the use or sale is ultimately for a use claimed within valid claims of the Merck patent. Assuming the claims here in issue are valid, any use or sale for the ultimate purpose or use of the enalapril maleate as an antihypertensive would infringe the plaintiffs' patent interests. Any use or sale for another ultimate purpose, if there be any, would not be an infringement. Nor, in my opinion, would the mere acquisition and holding in inventory of bulk enalapril maleate constitute an infringement.
Section 56 And Good Faith Considerations
[67]
The plaintiffs urge that in any event, the defendant cannot claim the benefit of s. 56 because of its conduct, or that of Dr. Sherman, its President, in particular in acquiring the bulk enalapril maleate prior to the issue of the patent.
[68]
In support of that submission reference is made to a number of cases which comment upon a generally stated principle as well recognized, that is, that the benefit of s. 56 may not be claimed by a person judged to be disentitled to claim the immunity on equitable principles, because of his own dishonest conduct. See e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 182 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.), at 650, where Hutcheon, J., found a breach of confidence arising from violation of an agreement and on that ground declined to permit reliance by the wrongdoer upon then s. 58 of the
Patent Act
.
[69]
In my view it is only in such circumstances, or where reliance upon s. 56 would smack of fraud in an ongoing relationship between the parties, that equitable principles may preclude reliance upon s. 56. Conduct of that sort requires clear evidence:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that even circumstances of copying goods that may reasonably be expected to be patented and subsequently are, does not preclude use and sale to others of the goods purchased, constructed or acquired prior to issue of a patent. It is clear that in Canada the plaintiffs had no recognized property in the invention of enalapril until the issue of the patent, and until then the defendant, as any other, was free to make or acquire, use or sell to others the compounds and compositions claimed in the patent later issued to Merck and for the uses claimed by the patent.
[70]
In the course of trial counsel for the plaintiffs in cross-examination of Dr. Bernard Sherman, President of Apotex, raised questions concerning Apotex's operations as commented upon in a number of judicial decisions of this court, the Court of Appeal and a United States District Court. After allowing some questions I ruled that further questions of this sort, though raised in cross-examination, were irrelevant to the matters at issue in this action for they dealt with factual circumstances not before me and with judicial expressions arising from those. I did not, however, preclude argument related to those other cases and to judicial utterances which are matters of public record in any event. Subsequent argument did not persuade me that criticism of the conduct of Apotex or that of Dr. Sherman in other cases was here relevant, or that in reliance upon comments of my judicial brethren, in regard to circumstances other than those here established, I should preclude reliance by the defendant upon s. 56 of the
Act
.
[71]
The factual basis for the plaintiffs' claim in this regard, and the basis for its claim arising from these circumstances that Apotex should be directed to deliver up the bulk enalapril maleate held in inventory, is summed up in the plaintiffs' written submissions as follows:
"64. It is submitted that the defendant is disentitled to the benefits of s. 56 not only in relation to the tablets it manufactured as discussed previously but also in relation to any of the bulk enalapril maleate, including that acquired prior to the date of issue of the patent. Evidence was adduced to the effect that Dr. Sherman knew of the Vasotec product and its success, knew of the issue of the Merck U.S. patent, was aware of changes to the Canadian
Patent Act
changing the exclusivity period granted to a patentee and armed with this knowledge proceeded to acquire sizable inventories of bulk enalapril maleate in the neighborhood of two tonnes thereof. The bulk material was acquired for about three million dollars and once tabletted in 5 mg tablet size could be sold for 260 million dollars."
[72]
I note in passing that the competition between pharmaceutical companies, like the plaintiffs, and generic drug companies, especially the defendant, is tough and toe to toe, in the court rooms as in the market place. The ultimate objective for each is to make money, to maximize profits for shareholders for that is what maintains each company and, in a competitive market, even one with monopolies under patents, that is what permits the companies to carry on their other activities. That said, the prime concern of the plaintiffs in regard to conduct of Apotex complained of, with respect, may be seen as concern over market share for the enalapril prescription market.
[73]
There is no evidence in this case of wrongdoing by Apotex, in its relations with the plaintiffs or with others. Dr. Sherman, apparently an aggressive entrepreneur, can hardly be criticized for doing what he was free to do in the acquisition of enalapril maleate prior to the grant of Merck's patent. Had Apotex managed to perfect its Apo-Enalapril product earlier it could have converted all the bulk material to tablets prior to the grant of the patent (though that might not have been sensible in any business view) and, in my view, it could have marketed all of that product with immunity from suit under s. 56 whenever the sales were made. As I have earlier suggested it may even be that if only some of the bulk product had been manufactured as tablets prior to October 16, 1990, the protection of s. 56 might be deemed to extend to permitting continued manufacturing as a use of the invention established by Apotex prior to the grant of Merck's patent, but that issue is not here presented and was not argued.
[74]
I have digressed. On this issue I conclude that if s. 56 were applicable and were found to provide immunity from suit for Apotex in relation to any use or sale of enalapril maleate, including sale of Apo-Enalapril, there is no evidence in this case of any facts which would give rise to barring, on equitable principles, its reliance upon s. 56.
Enalapril Maleate Obtained By Apotex
From Licensed Source
[75]
There was one further lot of bulk enalapril maleate, which Apotex acquired after the issue of Merck's patent but in different circumstances. Delmar applied for a compulsory license under the
Patent Act
as it was prior to 1993. It was granted a compulsory license on April 24, 1992 to manufacture enalapril or enalapril maleate in Canada, paying royalties to Merck. Thereafter in November 1992 at Delmar's request, Apotex received a further shipment of enalapril maleate on consignment, to produce tablets for a foreign customer of Delmar. Using some 24 kilograms of this additional bulk product produced by Delmar under its license, Apotex produced, and apparently shipped to Delmar's purchaser abroad, tablets containing 10 mg. of enalapril maleate as the active ingredient. Apotex billed Delmar for this work by an invoice dated December 14, 1992. By statute, under s. 12 of the
Patent Act Amendment Act, 1992
, Delmar's license ceased to have effect and all rights or privileges under the license were extinguished on February 14, 1993. Subsequently, on March 10, 1993, Apotex purchased 44.9 kilograms of bulk enalapril maleate from Delmar's foreign customer. That was the balance of the lot received on consignment in November 1992 and sold originally by Delmar to its foreign customer from stock manufactured under its compulsory license. Apotex's purchase, it is said, was intended to serve its own markets abroad, leaving the rest of the enalapril maleate in its inventory to supply the Canadian market.
[76]
The plaintiffs submit that in these circumstances the defendant has infringed its exclusive patent interests by production of tablets for Delmar even if this were done as it was, in the time that Delmar held a compulsory license. The defendant itself had no license to manufacture the tablets and it is urged that the defendant adduced no evidence that would justify any right in the defendant to manufacture under the license to Delmar. The defendant could not be said to be an agent of Delmar absent any evidence of such a relationship between them.
[77]
The defendant points to the terms of the license granted by the Commissioner of Patents to Delmar, which provided, in part,
"The patentee has stated that, since the applicant has expressed the intention of preparing or having prepared final dosage forms of the medicine for sale in Canada without indicating that it has the necessary facilities for so doing, the only way in which the veracity of these statements can be tested is for the Commissioner to grant a licence where the bulk manufacturer is prohibited from selling outside Canada until such time as it can supply evidence that it is complying with the basic fundamental policy underlying s. 39(4) of the
Act
of providing effective competition in Canada by selling the medicine here; however I am not prepared to so limit the licence since there is no requirement in the
Act
and
Rules
that an applicant possess all of the facilities to enable it to carry out all of the operations that have been requested by it at the time it makes its application or indeed at the time of the grant of the licence."
The license then grants to Delmar a nonexclusive license under the patent in suit to make, use, or sell the invention, "the medicine whose chemical or proper name is Enalapril" paying stipulated royalties to Merck, differing in amount in respect of medicine sold in bulk form from that sold in final dosage form. The defendant submits that under these terms Apotex in manufacturing tablets for Delmar is merely acting for the latter within the umbrella of Delmar's license. The defendant was not making or using the invention, or selling the product, for its own account.
[78]
I agree with the defendant that s. 12(2) of the
Patent Act Amendment Act, 1992
precludes any claim for infringement in respect of any act done before the license was terminated if done in accord with the terms of the license and the former legislation for compulsory licenses. Neither of those sources, in my view, created any right in the defendant to infringe the plaintiffs' interests under its patent, which were exclusive interests subject only to the compulsory license to Delmar.
[79]
In my opinion, whatever the rights of the plaintiffs in relation to Delmar may be, and they are not here in issue, the license to Delmar permitted the latter to make, use, or sell the invention for medicine, with knowledge of the Commissioner that it did not have facilities for making the final dosage form. It seems to me clearly implicit that Delmar could contract, under its license, for production of the final dosage form. The producer of that product, acting under contract for Delmar and not on its own account, in my opinion, does not infringe the plaintiffs' patent claims by producing the final dosage form from bulk product it held only on consignment, and at a time when Delmar's license was in effect under the law as it was until February 1993.
[80]
On the other hand, Apotex has no right, derived from or under the compulsory license to Delmar, to produce tablets for use as an antihypertensive from the 44.9 kilograms of bulk enalapril maleate purchased in March 1993, after the license to Delmar was terminated by statute. That result is not based on extinguishment of any rights Delmar may have had, under the license, in accord with the statutory amendment which terminated its license effective February 14, 1993. Rather, it is based on the lack of any right in the defendant to use the invention after the grant of the patent. It had not acquired this lot of enalapril maleate before the grant of Merck's patent and so has no claim to immunity by reason of s. 56 of the
Act
.
[81]
Thus, my conclusions in relation to the defendant's work with the bulk enalapril maleate produced by Delmar under its compulsory license are, first, that by producing tablets for Delmar, under contract during the term of Delmar's license, Apotex did not infringe the plaintiffs' patent interests. Second, the defendant has no immunity from suit for infringement if it were to produce tablets from the 44.9 kilograms of bulk enalapril maleate that it acquired in March 1993 even though that bulk product was produced by Delmar while it held a compulsory license.
[82]
As for the 44.9 kilograms of the bulk product manufactured by Delmar when it had a compulsory license to do so, in my opinion that bulk product, now the property of the defendant, may be used or sold in the bulk form by Apotex without infringing plaintiffs' interests, or may be used by the defendant or sold by it for any other use than is claimed under the patent. In my opinion, s. 12(1) of the amending
Act
which came into force in February 1993, does not apply retrospectively to extinguish any rights Delmar had under its license during the life of that license, including the right to sell, and to convey good title to a purchaser, of the invention manufactured under license.
The Validity Of Composition And Use Claims
[83]
Apotex pleads, as an alternative defence to the plaintiffs' claim of infringement, and by counterclaim it seeks a declaration, that the composition claims of the patent, claims 8 to 10, and the use claims are invalid. For its defence the use claims are claims 11 to 15 which the plaintiffs' allege have been infringed; for its counterclaim Apotex also pleads use claims 16 and 17 are invalid so that the counterclaim seeks a declaration that claims 8 to 17 are invalid.
[84]
The plaintiffs rely on the statutory presumption that a party attacking a patent has the onus of proving the patent is invalid. The
Act
by s. 43 provides, in part, that once a patent is issued under the signature of the Commissioner and the seal of the Patent Office, it "shall thereafter, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, be valid and avail the grantee and his legal representatives for the term mentioned" in s. 44 or s. 45. Under s. 44 that term is 20 years from the date of filing of an application after the effective date (February 14, 1994, as it turned out) or under s. 45 for any filing before that date, the term is 17 years.
[85]
In
Diversified Products Corp. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 350 (F.C.A.) at 359 (C.P.R.), Décary, J.A., endorsed the description of the presumption made by Pratte, J. (as he then was), in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  patent has introduced evidence, the court, in considering this evidence and in determining whether it establishes the invalidity of the patent, must not take the presumption into account. It cannot be said that the presumption created by s. 47 [now s. 43] is, as a rule, either easy or difficult to overcome; in some cases the circumstances may be such that the presumption will be easily rebutted, while in other cases the same result may be very difficult or even impossible to obtain."
[86]
The attack by Apotex on the validity of the patent arises on several grounds. The composition claims are first said to be invalid because no inventiveness is claimed in relation to them and it is urged that jurisprudence under the
Act
precludes validity in the circumstances of this case where the patent holder claims an invention in relation to new and novel compounds and in the same patent claims protection for composition claims in which no additional inventiveness is claimed. Secondly, the composition claims are said to lack the descriptive specification required under s. 34 of the
Act
. Both the composition and the use claims are said to be invalid since they are in essence descriptions of medical treatment intended for humans and thus are not within the definition of an "invention" in the
Act
. Finally, both composition and use claims are said to be simply redundant of each other and of the claims expressed or implied by the claims in relation to the compounds.
[87]
In some respects the challenges raised by Apotex overlap. I propose to deal with them in the order set out, even if the effort to separate them one from another leads to some overlap in these reasons.
Composition Claims Which Are Not Inventive
[88]
The first challenge to validity relates to the absence of any claim to novelty or inventiveness in the composition claims, which absence the plaintiffs acknowledge aside from the inventiveness incorporated in the composition by inclusion of the new compounds in which the patent claims novelty or inventiveness under claims 1 to 5 (or 1 to 7 for purposes of the defence to the counterclaim). In these circumstances Apotex urges that the composition claims are not valid, on the basis of jurisprudence under the
Act
, a basis refuted by the plaintiffs.
[89]
Before tracing their respective arguments it is useful to note the statutory regime applicable at the time the decisions were rendered. That regime differed in an important respect from that now prevailing, as I understand it. Under s. 39(1) of the
Act
(formerly s. 41(1) and so referred to in the jurisprudence relied upon by Apotex), substances prepared by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine could not be claimed as an invention except when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture also particularly described and claimed. In a shorthand way the regime was described as one where, in the case of medicines produced by chemical process, there could be no claim to an invention in the product except when it resulted from a claimed process. That regime ended in 1987 with amendment to the
Act
, which provided this exceptional basis for claiming a patent would be applicable, but only for a period of four years from the date of amendment, and then only in relation to inventions relating to naturally occurring substances prepared or produced by microbiological processes and intended for food or medicine (R.S.C. 1985 (3rd Supp), c. 33 (or S.C. 1987, c. 41) s. 14). Thus, after 1987, a claim to a medical product produced by a chemical process, may be valid, as any other chemical product, without also claiming the chemical process for its production.
[90]
I turn to the jurisprudence relied upon. It starts with
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex.Ct.), which concerned an appeal from refusal of the Commissioner of Patents to grant a patent in respect of certain claims put forth by the applicant. Disallowed were claims to compositions including compounds which were already the subject of a separate patent. As I read the decision of Cameron, J., the composition claims were held to be properly rejected by the Commissioner because they did not meet the statutory requirement for specification of the invention. At p. 126 the learned justice notes that the composition claims
"... do not state definitely and in explicit terms the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new, that they are so broad that they may cover compositions which the applicant 'does not know and has not dreamed of', and consequently they fail to comply with the provisions of s. 35(2) of the
Act
. The appeal as to these claims fails on these grounds and it is unnecessary to discuss at length the other objections raised by counsel for the Commissioner."
However, the learned judge continued, in obiter as I read his decision:
"I am of the opinion, however, that when a claim to a compound has been allowed, a claim to a fungicidal composition merely having that compound 'as an active ingredient' is not patentable ... The utility of the compounds as fungicides is fully set forth in the specification of the patent which has been allowed; to name the compound as a fungicidal composition is merely to recite one of its inherent qualities."
[91]
That case,
Rohm & Haas
, was not concerned with an invention for medicine produced by a chemical process, but similar circumstances involving just such a product arose for consideration in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. 9 (S.C.C.). In that case the Supreme Court considered an appeal from the decision of the Exchequer Court which had allowed an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner rejecting an application, for a patent relating to composition claims, by the holder of patents for the compounds which were included in the compositions for medicinal products. The composition claims provided for combining the inventive compounds, already patented, with a "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier". It was noted by Judson, J., for the Supreme Court that the Commissioner had rejected the application on two grounds, first, that "the applicant was entitled only to one patent for an invention and the composition claims did not inventively distinguish from the product claims already granted. The inventive feature of the claimed composition was in the [compound] and not in the association of the compound with the carrier". The second ground was that the claims related to substances prepared by a chemical process and intended for medicine and they were prohibited because they amounted to an attempt to protect the substances claimed, i.e., the compositions, other than by a patentable process by which they were produced, contrary to s. 41(1) as it then was. Judson, J., unlike the Exchequer Court, found no novelty or inventive ingenuity in the composition claims, which in his view simply claimed dilutions of the medicinal substance, the compound, for which a patent had already issued. Combining that substance, the patented compound, with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier merely diluted the compound already patented and that was not an inventive step or process.
[92]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 210 (S.C.C.), Mr. Justice Pigeon for the Supreme Court upheld, virtually without comment except to agree with the view of Thurlow, J. (as he was then), at trial in the Exchequer Court, holding invalid certain composition claims consisting of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound, claimed in the same patent, with a pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic carrier. Thurlow, J., had found these claims invalid for several reasons, including the lack of any invention involved in mixing the substance, the compound, with a carrier, a ground he based on the decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Hoechst
. The patent in suit in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> did concern an invention of a chemical product intended for medicine, and so it was a product to which s. 41(1) of the
Act
, as it was then, applied. The cryptic endorsement of Pigeon, J., (at 212 of 8 C.P.R.(2d)), with reference to the two composition claims involved, is:
"... In this respect, Thurlow, J., said [(1970) 64 C.P.R. 14 at 35]:
'These last mentioned claims, as I see it, cannot stand as claims in respect of any inventive step involved in the mixture of a substance with a carrier since there is no invention involved in such a step.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), a case involving a patent for an insecticide, not an invention intended for medicine, the Court of Appeal upheld the Commissioner of Patents who had refused to accept certain composition claims which incorporated a compound claimed in the same patent application with certain designated carriers. The Patent Appeal Board decision, endorsed by the Commissioner, relied in part on the endorsement by Pigeon, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra. In its brief decision on appeal from the Commissioner, the Court of Appeal referred to the case as being indistinguishable in relation to composition claims from those considered  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Hoechst, Sandoz
and
Rohm & Haas
.
[94]
That line of jurisprudence is summed up by Mr. Justice Heald in the Court of Appeal in the subsequent decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  who had disallowed certain composition claims. Heald, J.A., said at p. 4:
"The Appeal Board relied on the
Farbwerke Hoechst
case (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .), the
Rohm & Haas
case (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.); aff'd (1972), 8 C.P.R.(2d) 210 (S.C.C. sub nom
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  decision of the Commissioner of Patents reported in May 17, 1977 C.P.O.R. xvii.) as authority for the principle that merely taking a compound and mixing it with a usual carrier so that the compound can better perform the function it was invented for does not involve inventive ingenuity. I agree with the Appeal Board that the above cited jurisprudence is authority for that proposition. I also agree that subject composition claims seek to do exactly that, and nothing more. They are accordingly invalid."
[95]
Then the Supreme Court of Canada determined
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1, and upon that decision and practice thereafter of the Patent Office, the plaintiffs here rely for validity of the composition claims, claims 8, 9, 10, in the patent in suit.
[96]
In
Shell Oil
the court was concerned with an application for a patent for certain chemical compositions comprised of chemical compounds, both old and new, mixed with an adjuvant for use in regulating the growth of plants, not a product for use for medicine. The applicant originally included in its application claims relating to the new compounds, but withdrew those before determination by the examiner, leaving its claims for compositions including the compounds, new and old, and its invention was described as the discovery that specific chemical compounds have useful properties in respect of the regulation of plant growth. The Federal Court of Appeal had upheld the Commissioner of Patents in rejecting these composition claims. The Supreme Court of Canada, finding the invention claimed was the discovery of the usefulness of the compounds as plant growth regulators, allowed the appeal, thus upholding the validity of composition claims in that case.
[97]
In discussing the composition claims insofar as those involved new compounds,
Shell Oil
involved the same circumstances as in the case at bar except that in
Shell Oil
the claims in relation to new compounds were no longer included in the patent application, Madame Justice Wilson speaking for the court said, in part, as follows (at pp. 13, 14):
"I turn now to the claims for the compositions containing new compounds. As already mentioned, the main objection to these claims was based on the
Farbwerke Hoechst
line of cases and in particular the Federal Court of Appeal decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applying the reasoning  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Hoechst
to substances not intended for food or medicine and therefore not subject to the restrictions of s. 41 of the
Act
. The brief reasons of Heald, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> have already been quoted.
"It seems to me that Mr. Justice Heald was in error when he stated that the
Farbwerke Hoechst
line of cases 'are indistinguishable on any valid ground from the case at bar' and that the commissioner therefore 'correctly ... interpreted and applied the principles in those cases' to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . They were, in my view, distinguishable in a very material respect, namely, that they were all cases falling within s. 41 and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was not. I do not think it is possible to read those cases without concluding that one of the reasons for the rejection of the composition claims in those cases was that to allow them would permit the applicants to avoid the impact of s. 41 in respect of substances clearly falling within it. I agree with counsel for the appellant that these cases did not establish a broad principle that compositions containing new compounds mixed with an inert carrier were not patentable. They did establish, however, that no inventive ingenuity is involved in mixing a compound with a carrier. Accordingly, if the compound is patented, there is no invention in the composition. That proposition, in my view, makes eminent good sense whether the substance is covered by s. 41 or not and I think it affords an adequate basis for the result reached by the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
. . . . .
"In cases such as
Farbwerke Hoechst
it seems to me that s. 36 would constitute a barrier to a claim in respect of the compositions even if no claim had been made or patent existed in these cases in respect of the compounds. Because those cases held that there was no further inventive step involved in mixing the compounds with inert carriers, a claim for the compositions in these cases would, it seems to me, extend beyond the scope of the invention and violate s. 36. The applicants therefore would have no election in such cases. They could not opt for a patent on the compositions instead of on the compounds. Does the appellant here face the same problem?
"It seems to me that he does not. If I am right in my earlier conclusion in relation to the compositions containing the old compounds, namely, that there is inventive ingenuity in the idea of using compounds having this particular chemical structure as plant growth regulators, then the appellant's invention in the case of the new compounds did not stop with the creation of the compounds and the patenting of the compounds would not give it protection for its idea. The mixture of the compounds with the appropriate adjuvants was necessary in order to embody the idea in practical form. It cannot therefore be said that in this case there is no inventive step involved in mixing the compounds with carriers appropriate for their application to plants. It is true, as counsel for the commissioner submitted, that once it is decided that these compounds are to be applied to plants, no inventive step is involved in selecting the appropriate carriers; they are common knowledge in the field. But I think this is to miss the point. A disembodied idea is not per se patentable. But it will be patentable if it has a method of practical application. The appellant has shown a method of practical application in this case."
[98]
In summing up her decision in
Shell Oil
, Wilson, J., notes her conclusions that the discovery claimed by the patent application, a means of regulating the growth of plants, is "a new and useful art" having economic value in the field of trade, and that there was no obstacle in s. 36 or any other provision of the
Act
to the grant of a patent on the compositions there claimed. She then commented (at p. 16):
"... I make no observation, however, on whether or not the appellant, can succeed in a subsequent application for patent on a subordinate element of its invention, namely, the compounds themselves. This is not before us, the appellant having abandoned such a claim at an early stage of the proceedings."
[99]
The defendant Apotex urges that
Shell Oil
is distinguishable on its facts, and so it is. In the case at bar claims are included in the Merck patent for new compounds said to be created by inventive ingenuity, but, in addition to claims for use, the patent also claims for compositions of the compounds with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which it is acknowledged by plaintiffs involve no inventive step beyond that claimed in the included compounds.
Shell Oil
involved a patent application for composition claims found by Wilson, J., in the Supreme Court to be necessary in order to embody the invention there claimed, the regulation of plant growth, in practical form. The composition claim there was described by the learned justice as "a method of practical application" for the invention claimed. It is upon that same ground that the plaintiffs here found their submission that the composition claims are valid, as a practical application, necessary for the application of the invention claimed. The invention claimed includes new compounds, and particular uses including the composition claims as a use necessary to permit the invention to serve the ultimate use for which the patent claims provide, as an antihypertensive.
[100]
The defendant urges that the claims of Merck's patent put this matter clearly within the application of the line of cases consisting of
Rohm & Haas, Farbwerke Hoechst A.G., Sandoz
and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As summed up by Heald, J., in the Court of Appeal in dealing with
Shell Oil
, as we noted earlier, those cases may be read to support the conclusion that a composition claim, i.e., "taking a compound and mixing it with a usual carrier so that the compound can better perform the function it was invented for does not involve inventive ingenuity", and in his view such a claim is invalid.
[101]
Perhaps I should note that, while the matter was not here argued, the fact that two of those cases,
Farbwerke Hoechst A.G.
and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> were concerned with patent claims relating to chemical products intended for use as medicines, and the others were not, may be an essential factor in considering the respective decisions. Yet now that the legislative regime no longer includes the equivalent of the former s. 39(1), limiting claims for patents in medicinal products to those produced by the chemical processes also claimed, the principles of all those earlier decisions have relevance for other patent claims. Put another way the cautionary note by Wilson, J., in
Shell Oil
about distinguishing the cases by considering whether they concerned a product intended for medicine no longer has the same significance as when she wrote, an approach that here implicitly underlies arguments of counsel for both parties, as I understood their submissions.
[102]
Not surprisingly the plaintiffs perceive the jurisprudence somewhat differently than the defendant. They urge that a careful reading does not warrant derivation of a general principle that claims to compounds and claims to compositions including the compounds cannot be combined in a single patent. They accept the decisions of
Rohm & Haas
and
Farbwerke Hoechst A.G.
as warranting the conclusions reached in each, for both concerned situations where there was an existing patent for compounds and subsequent applications were made for patents in compositions including those compounds, which compositions included no inventive step beyond the compound already subject to patent. It is urged the outcome of those cases simply reflects that there cannot be separate patents for compounds and for compositions including the compounds but no separate inventive step. In short, each patent must be for an invention, and a claim for a composition which is not inventive, separate from a claim to a compound already patented, cannot be considered an invention under the
Act
.
[103]
Yet within a single patent the plaintiffs say a variety of aspects of an invention claimed may be included. See Hall, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -Owens-Ford
, supra, at p. 230. It has been longstanding practice to acknowledge and permit different kinds of claims in the same patent. Thus a patent may relate to apparatus and process claims, product and apparatus claims, or product and process claims as was formerly the only means of claiming a product intended for medicine. That practice it is said, with respect, was ignored by the decision of Thurlow, J., in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case at trial in the Exchequer Court, though as I read his decision he goes beyond merely invalidating composition claims because they were included in a patent application with compound claims, where the former, composition claims, were not inventive in themselves. In my view he declined to accept the composition claims as valid effectively for other reasons, relating to the specification requirements under the
Act
, under now s. 34. The endorsement of a summary view of Thurlow, J.'s, opinion by Pigeon, J., in the Supreme Court decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is said, with respect, to be without reference to earlier cases and difficult to interpret for significance. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it is urged the Court of Appeal simply reflected the outcome of the earlier cases referred to without examining the reasoning.
[104]
Against this jurisprudential tapestry the plaintiffs urge that in
Shell Oil
, Madame Justice Wilson sought to swing the court's jurisprudence back to where it was with the Supreme Court's decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Hoechst A.G.
Thus
Shell Oil
is said to reflect the underlying principle that composition claims may well be a proper basis of an invention as defined in the
Act
. There the court was considering only composition, and use, claims. Wilson, J., notes that earlier decisions "did not establish a broad principle that compositions containing new compounds mixed with an inert carrier were not patentable. They did establish, however, that no inventive ingenuity is involved in mixing a compound with a carrier. Accordingly, if the compound is patented, there is no invention in the composition". That, it is urged, does not go further than to say that there cannot be separate patents for compounds, and for compositions which include the patented compounds but no separate inventive step.
[105]
Plaintiffs further point to the practice which it is said evolved in the patent office following the Supreme Court decision in
Shell Oil
. That practice is evident from materials included in the authorities referred to by plaintiffs, including Canadian Patent Office,
Manual of Patent Office Practice
(Ottawa-Hull, January 1990), s. 10.02.02. It is evident also in
Shell Canada Ltd. Patent Application, Re
(1986), 28 C.P.R.(3d) 213 (Patent A.B. and Commissioner). The former indicates that the Patent Office was prepared, in a proper case, to accept claims to the use of a product which claim is in the form of a composition in which the product is an ingredient, and to accept such claims in the same application as claims to the product.
[106]
There is much to be said in support of the interpretation of the relevant jurisprudence by the plaintiffs. There is, for example, no general principle requiring that each claim in a patent to be considered valid must include inventive ingenuity distinct from that in all other claims. Claims, if valid, deal with different aspects of the same invention, not with separate inventions, and each patent must concern a single invention. Dependant claims, properly framed, are readily accepted. It seems to me the art of drafting claims may involve a particular skill in incorporating aspects of one claim in another. On another tack, if the practices of the Patent Office, based in part on the Registrar's interpretation of the law, including the cases culminating in the decision of the Supreme Court in
Shell Oil
, were a matter for judicial review, a reviewing court would accord deference to the decisions and process of the Registrar as a highly specialized officer responsible for a specialized office function that is important in the structure of trade and commerce in this country and internationally. At the same time I acknowledge, as the defendant urges, that the practices and legal interpretations of the Patent Office or of the Registrar are not determinative of the state of the law.
[107]
The perceptions of both parties concerning the appropriate reading of the relevant jurisprudence are helpful but neither, in my view, resolves the issue decisively. Both have one underlying philosophy, that is, that the cases be carefully read and applied. That philosophy I here follow.
[108]
In my view, despite occasional judicial comments that may be interpreted otherwise, the cases do not establish a principle that claims for compounds and claims for compositions of those compounds in or with a carrier cannot coexist, as valid claims, within the same patent. If the composition claims include no inventive step aside from that included in the compound already claimed and if they are not, in the terms used by Wilson, J., in
Shell Oil
, necessary in order to embody in a practical form, the invention claimed in a use, or if they fail to meet the statutory requirements for specifications under s. 34 of the
Act
then the composition claims are invalid. In my view, in the jurisprudence here referred to by the parties, where composition claims were not accepted or invalid, that was for reasons other than the existence of compound claims in the same patent.
[109]
Here the plaintiffs claim to rely upon the qualification underlying the decision of Wilson, J., in
Shell Oil
, that is, the composition claims, while not inventive in themselves, are necessary to embody a claim for use of the compound in a practical form. Only in a practical form could the new compounds be used for the uses for which they are intended, uses claimed in other claims. That may be obvious, but in any event it was clearly stated in the testimony of Dr. Schwartz, an expert who testified on behalf of the plaintiffs.
[110]
In my view, the validity of the composition claims here ultimately turns on the assessment of whether they meet requirements of the
Act
for specifications in a patent. That issue I turn to after considering the defendant's argument, directed to both composition and use claims, that these are invalid because the patent essentially claims a medical treatment.
The Claims In Issue And Methods Of
Medical Treatment
[111]
Claims in a patent which in essence are determined to concern a medical treatment are not within the definition of "invention" in s. 2 of the
Act
, that is, they are not considered to be
"any new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter;"
Claims of that sort are thus not subject to patent under the
Act
:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 202, affing. (1970), 62 C.P.R. 117 (Ex. Ct.).
[112]
It is true that the patent in issue concerns what is said to be an invention, including claims to compounds, compositions, and use of those in prescription medicines for the treatment of disease, or health conditions, that is for use as antihypertensives. The invention, in my opinion, is not for a method or methods of medical treatment. The specification of the patent does not purport to describe such a method. It does describe a range of consumption of the compounds claimed which are perceived as useful as antihypertensives, i.e., in treating hypertension. Yet, the descriptive text of the specification acknowledges that administration of the products within the patent can only be determined for medical purposes by a person skilled in the art of prescribing medicines. Thus the description provides, in part:
"Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful as antihypertensives in treating hypertensive mammals, including humans and they can be utilized to achieve the reduction of blood pressure by formulating in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. The compounds of this invention can be administered to patients (animals and human) in need of such treatment in a dosage range of 5 to 500 mg per patient generally given several times, thus giving a total daily dose of from 5 to 2000 mg per day. The dose will vary depending on severity of disease, weight of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize.
"Also the compounds of this invention may be given in combination with other diuretics or antihypertensives. Typically these are combinations whose individual per day dosages range from one-fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly.
. . . . .
"... The above dose ranges will be adjusted on a unit basis as necessary to permit divided daily dosage. Also, the dose will vary depending on the severity of the disease, weight of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize."
[113]
I am not persuaded that the principle of
Tennessee Eastman
is here applicable. When one examines claims of other chemical or pharmaceutical patents so far as these are determinable from the decisions counsel referred to, the claims in the patent in suit are not unusual. In my view they are different from the claims  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Eastman
. They are different in kind from those rejected and found to be properly so by the Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 289 (F.C.A.), where the claims in issue were concerned with methods of cleaning dental plaque or stains from human teeth. They are different in kind from those rejected by the Patent Appeal Board and the Commissioner in
Regents of the University of Minnesota Patent Application, Re
(1988), 29 C.P.R.(3d) 42 (Pat. A.B. & Commissioner), where the invention was found to concern a medical treatment, a method of treating cancer and a method of administering a compound to alleviate nausea arising from treating the cancer.
[114]
My conclusion on this issue is that claims 8 to 10 and 11 to 17 are not claims of an invention that is concerned with methods of medical treatment, and they are not invalid on that ground, as was argued by the defendant.
The Specification And S. 34 Of The Act
[115]
I come to the main attack of the defendant upon the validity of claims 8 to 17 in the patent in suit. In its amended statement of defence Apotex alleges several deficiencies in the patent's specification, including that none of these claims discloses any invention; that any invention claimed in these claims is not an invention but mainly the result of expected skill and a workshop improvement; that each of the claims was not novel but was obvious, in particular that a compound useful for treatment of a disease would be used by putting it into a composition for purposes of administering it; that the specification does not comply with s. 34(1) of the
Act
in a variety of respects; and that the specification including the claims does not comply with s. 34(2) of the
Act
by failing to state distinctly and in explicit terms the matters that are regarded as new and because the claims claim more than was invented. Finally, it is urged that the claims are redundant, and do not define any invention. Those same allegations are the basis of the defendant's counterclaim for a declaration that claims 8 to 17 are each invalid or void.
[116]
A number of the defects pleaded by the defendant are not in issue because the plaintiffs do not claim any inventive step, in the composition claims or in the use claims, beyond that included by reason of the novel compounds. In the result the only remaining grounds contested at trial as the bases for the defendant's allegations of invalidity in regard to claims 8 to 17 are those concerning compliance with s. 34, and the argument that the claims are redundant.
[117]
Section 34 of the
Act
insofar as it is relevant, provides:
"34(1) An applicant shall in the specification of his invention
(a) correctly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor;
(b) set out clearly the various steps in a process, or the method of constructing, making, compounding or using a machine, manufacture or composition of matter, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, or with which it is most closely connected, to make, construct, compound or use it;
. . . . .
(e) particularly indicate and distinctly claim the part, improvement or combination that he claims as his invention.
"(2) The specification referred to in subs. (1) shall end with a claim or claims stating distinctly and in explicit terms the things or combinations that the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property or privilege."
[118]
The granting of a patent, by which the inventor has an exclusive right to exploit his invention for a period of time, is based upon the exchange of that exclusive right for the complete disclosure to the public of the invention and the way it operates. The description must be sufficiently complete and accurate to enable a workman, skilled in the art to which the invention relates, to construct or use the invention when the period of the monopoly has expired. It must meet two conditions, namely, it must describe the nature of the invention and it must define the way it is produced or built or how it is put into operation. A failure of the first condition invalidates the patent for ambiguity while a failure to meet the second invalidates it for insufficiency.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. 99, affd. (1952), 15 C.P.R. 133 (P.C.).
[119]
The statutory requirements are not met, so the defendant argues, in three respects. First, it is urged that at the time the original application for a patent was submitted, in 1979, Merck itself had not formulated, or developed, the dosage form for any of the compounds claimed. That much is clear from the evidence, for clinical trials and formulating work had not begun or were then only just beginning. In light of this the defendant says that the composition claims could not be valid for at the time of application Merck could not have specified what constituted "an effective amount" of the active compound or what constituted a "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" in the terms of claims 8, 9 and 10 which in essence describe
"A pharmaceutical composition for reducing hypertension comprising
an effective amount
of [a specified compound claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 respectively] with
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
." (Underlining for emphasis added)
[120]
Even though the evidence does support a conclusion that those particular terms could not have been specified by Merck in 1979. I am persuaded that the date of significance in this regard, that is, in regard to the patent applicant's ability to meet the specification requirements under s. 34 of the
Act
, is the date at the time the patent issues. Until then an application is just that, and it may be amended or withdrawn at any time before a patent is granted. In the case of certain products, chemicals or pharmaceutical chemicals, it may take some years from discovery of a useful product that is patentable to the date when all requirements for producing a marketable product are worked out. It is not the latter, that is the details necessary for producing the product, which determines whether the patent is valid under the statute, rather, it is whether the specification meets the requirements under s. 34. If the specification is drawn in terms of the statutory requirements and the patentee, if asked, is in a position to provide all relevant details at the time the patent issues, then it is not significant thereafter that some of those details were unclear at the date the application for a patent is filed.
[121]
Here there is no evidence Merck could not provide full details of its invention claimed under the patent in 1990 when the patent issued. Its U.S. patent was then in force for some seven years, its Vasotec product was sold in the U.S. since 1985 and in Canada since 1987. By 1990, when Merck's patent issued in Canada, it could not be said that the plaintiffs could not provide specifications of their compounds or of their composition claims if then asked.
[122]
The second major argument of the defendant in regard to claims 8, 9 and 10 is that the Merck patent specification does not set out what constitutes
an effective amount
of the specified compounds, the active ingredients in the composition claims. In this regard the reference in the description to "a dosage range of 5 to 500 mg per patient" (animal and human) ... "giving a total daily dose of from 5 to 2000 mg per day", ignores Merck's own production of tablets of 2.5 mg of active ingredient in Vasotec, and that the upper range suggested for daily dosage may be virtually toxic in the view of one witness. Yet, I am persuaded that the specification in its terms includes more than Merck's Vasotec products for human consumption, for it describes a range of dosage for several compounds claimed, some more active than others, for use in treating hypertension, not only in humans but in animals as well, including large animals like horses. On this point I accept the evidence of Drs. Patchett and Schwartz that to the person skilled in the art for whom the specification is written, here a combination of clinical physician and industrial pharmaceutical chemist at least in regard to producing finished product for human consumption, once a product has been discovered and its intended use established, determination of
an effective amount
to be included in a delivery system, a dosage amount, is not an inventive step even if it requires some experimental work by persons of experience and skill, extrapolating from other known products for similar uses and from experimental work with animals and clinical trials with human subjects.
[123]
A third major argument of the defendant is that the composition claims are not complete or sufficient in specifying a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
in two respects. In the first place as the defendant's expert witness Dr. Niebergall makes clear in his expert affidavit and his testimony, the elements or excipients included in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are not stated. His suggestion that the nature of the means of delivery is unspecified, does not, in my view, take account of the description's references to utilization of the compounds of the invention by oral or by parenteral administration. The description also refers to illustrative adjuvants for "incorporation in tablets, capsules and the like", to the possibility of other ingredients in capsules, still others in tablets and others in sterile compositions for injection. At least in that aspect, in my view the specification points clearly to delivery by "tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration" or by "sterile solution or suspensions for parenteral administration".
[124]
Ultimately I accept the evidence of Dr. Schwartz, and I so find that for one skilled in the art of composing dosage forms the specification as here set out is in general adequate for determining the adjuvants or other ingredients to be mixed with the active compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Whatever the shortcomings of the patent specifications may be said to be, the ultimate answer to the defendant's argument on this point, in my view, is clearly seen from the evidence of Dr. Sherman of Apotex. Even if he did not seek to rely on the specification set out in the patent, he did, by experimentation, albeit with some difficulty, develop a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for enalapril maleate  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's own Apo-Enalapril product. The carrier was different, on the evidence, from that developed by Merck, but there was no claim and no evidence that the carrier developed by Apotex was ineffective for the purpose intended, to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for concentrations of one of the compounds in the patent in suit for a prescription medicine product comparable to the Merck product and for the same use. Had Dr. Sherman not been so successful, this action would not have commenced. The circumstances of Apotex's own development belie any argument that one skilled in the art of tablet formulation could not exploit the invention upon expiry of the patent.
[125]
Apotex also urges that the composition claims do not meet the requirements of s. 34(2) because they include no reference to a difficulty encountered, it is said by both Apotex and Merck, in formulating their respective products. If one accepts Dr. Schwartz's view that the description does provide, for one skilled in the art of developing dosage systems for pharmaceutical preparations, sufficient information that the patentee's invention can be duplicated after its monopoly term expires, Apotex contends that the difficulty alluded to is not referred to in the specification.
[126]
The difficulty encountered is said to be that including the compound enalapril maleate, here said to be the active ingredient, in both Vasotec and Apo-Enalapril, with regularly accepted adjuvants, as the patent indicates, presented a major problem in assuring stability of the product and avoiding undue disintegration. Dr. Sherman, who was directly responsible for overseeing product formulation  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , said that in his experience the development of a product for consumption in dosage form where the active ingredient was comparatively small was a "no-brainer", easily accomplished. In this particular case, however, he had encountered the most difficulty of any product development in his experience. From document production by Merck, for counsel's eyes only by agreement, it was apparent that addition of one common adjuvant, sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, was a part of Merck's tablet development and questions were asked in the course of discovery about this. Questions were also raised at trial, of Dr. Schwartz, an expert appearing for the plaintiffs, and Drs. Niebergall and McClelland, experts for the defendant. The questions sought confirmation that the Merck process of tablet formulation may well have been inventive in the manner of its resolution of the problem of disintegration, by producing a reaction through use of sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, and water, that solved the stability problem but left something other than enalapril maleate as the active ingredient. None of the experts could confirm this was the inevitable result of the information provided to them, though all confirmed that depending upon the process of mixing and the relative volume of water mixed, a reaction could be expected.
[127]
Apotex sought to adduce evidence of this as a result of the following circumstances. Trial in this matter extended over two weeks from March 28 to 31, and from April 11 to 16, with a break between the two sessions. During the course of the first week the parties agreed that their respective product monographs provided to the Health Protection Branch in relation to NOC requirements might be exchanged. Though until then these had been held "for counsel's eyes only", in fact the product monograph has generally been treated as a public document for some time. When this was made available and seen by Dr. Sherman of Apotex for the first time at the trial on or about March 30, his experience in formulating Apo-Enalapril confirmed in his mind that Merck must have encountered difficulties, as he had, in relation to stability of the product when developing the dosage forms. In the interval between the sittings at trial Apotex had undertaken testing in relation to Merck's Vasotec product. That testing, it was suggested, would confirm that Merck's formulating process worked and produced a stable product only because in that process a chemical reaction occurred, perhaps inventive and not obvious, but one which was not described in the specification, and which it was said left some enalapril compound, other than enalapril maleate, as the active ingredient in Vasotec. After hearing counsel on the matter I ruled that the evidence of Dr. Sherman on this aspect of the case, and of Apotex's testing in regard to Vasotec, and alternative evidence of a demonstrative nature proposed to be offered to the court through Dr. Neibergall, was not to be admitted. I did so on the general principles evolved in the practice of this court in relation to testing, whether before or during trial, which are intended to ensure fairness as between the parties and to ensure that the court has evidence from both sides about tests conducted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.).
[128]
I excluded the evidence also because it seemed to me not to be relevant to issues before the court in this action which concerns alleged infringement of the plaintiffs' patent interests and alleged invalidity of the claims of the patent said to be infringed.
[129]
In the result, in regard to the defendant's allegations, I am not persuaded that claims 8, 9 and 10 of the plaintiff Merck's patent are invalid because they do not meet the specification requirements of s. 34 of the
Act
. Rather, I conclude that the specifications of the patent in suit do meet those statutory requirements.
[130]
I reach that conclusion after considering authorities referred to by the defendant. I am not persuaded that the specification, including the claims, in this case is comparable to that in
Societé des usines chimiques  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. 207; 69 D.L.R.(2d) 353, where insufficiency was found in the failure to correctly and fully describe the utility of known methods applied to known compounds. Nor is the specification comparable to that in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 289 (F.C.A.), affing. (1987), 11 F.T.R. 161; 15 C.P.R.(3d) 217 (T.D.), where the primary claim was found to be ambiguous, and insufficient as not informing the reader what was within and what was not within the claim for a combination of known compounds said to be effective in the treatment of certain bacterial infections resistant to a particular sufonamide. I reach the same conclusion after comparing the specifications of the patents in issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  &  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, and in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Redundancy Of Claims
[131]
I turn briefly to the alleged redundancy of claims. This is urged as a basis, together with a lack of inventiveness, with particular reference to the use claims, 11 to 17 of the patent in suit. It will be recalled those claims are simply expressed, in each case, as
"
The use of
[a specified compound set out as claimed in claims 1 to 7, respectively]
as an antihypertensive
." (emphasis by underlining added)
[132]
The plaintiffs do not say that there is an inventive element in these claims, except for the claimed compound in each case and its use as an antihypertensive. Since that use is the stated utility of the invention under the patent, as set out in the description, the defendant urges this adds nothing inventive and is simply redundant and invalid. I reiterate that I do not understand the jurisprudence, or the
Act
, to require each claim of a patent to be inventive in a manner independent from all other claims. Nor in this particular case are the use claims in any way redundant of the compound claims for the latter make no reference to use but simply claim the compounds set out in each of claims 1 to 7, relying for utility on that set out in the general description of the invention and in the use claims 11 to 17. The composition claims 8, 9 and 10 do include reference to the intended use in each case as "for reducing hypertension". Each of those claims in essence is a "use claim". The only claims for which it might be concluded there is redundancy are in the paring of claims 8 and 11, claims 9 and 12 and claims 10 and 13. In my opinion, that does not in itself mean that claims 11, 12, and 13 or claims 8, 9 and 10 should be deemed invalid. If each is valid in terms of the specification requirements in s. 34 of the
Act
, neither should be considered invalid simply because it expresses in different words a valid claim.
[133]
In my opinion, the use claims 11 to 17 meet the requirements of s. 34(2) of the
Act
. They specify and fully describe the specific use of the compounds claimed in the patent, an antihypertensive, in a manner that cannot be misunderstood by one skilled in the art of formulating pharmaceutical compounds for prescription medicines. In the case of each claim that is the only use claimed for the compound concerned. It is clear that all other potential uses are not within the scope of the use claims.
[134]
My general conclusion in relation to Apotex's defence, and its counterclaim attacking the validity of the Merck patent claims 8 to 17 is that its defence to Merck's claims for infringement of claims 8 to 10 and 11 to 15 fails, and its counterclaim that claims 8 to 17 are invalid, is to be dismissed.
Conclusions And Relief
[135]
My conclusions on the facts of this case as I find them, and on the law as it is applicable, are the following.
[136]
The action by the plaintiffs, based upon infringing acts of the defendant in regard to the plaintiffs' exclusive rights under patent number, 1,275,349 is allowed, in light of the following conclusions.
1) By its activities in manufacturing Apo-Enalapril and marketing that product Apotex has infringed claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8-10 and 11-15.
2) The defence of Apotex based on s. 56 of the
Act
, in the circumstances of this case, does not avail to provide immunity to the claim for infringement by the plaintiffs arising from certain activities of the defendant. In my opinion s. 56 does not provide immunity for production and sale of Apo-Enalapril tablets after October 16, 1990 when the Merck patent was granted, whether that production be from
a) bulk enalapril maleate acquired prior to the grant of the patent, or
b) from certain lots of bulk enalapril maleate acquired by the defendant after the grant of Merck's patent which, on the evidence, I find was not in existence until after the patent issued but was produced in bulk for delivery to Apotex thereafter, including one shipment acquired in March 1993 that was made in Canada by another under a compulsory license.
3) If I am wrong in relation to any aspect of 2) supra, so that s. 56 is a valid defence for Apotex in relation to any portion of the inventory of bulk enalapril maleate that it acquired, it is not precluded from reliance upon that statutory provision by equitable principles. Nothing in the conduct of Apotex or its president, in relation to the acquisition of enalapril maleate, or the production of Apo-Enalapril or its sale, or in its relations to or with the plaintiffs, would warrant denying the defendant immunity pursuant to s. 56 if that provision were applicable in the circumstances.
4) Claims 1 to 5 and 8 to 15, and claims 16 and 17 in the plaintiff Merck's patent are valid claims, even though the composition claims 8 to 10 and use claims 11 to 17 do not include an element of inventiveness other than that derived from the compounds included for the use specified in each claim.
The invention, and the patent, do not claim a medical treatment.
The specification, including the claims 8 to 10 and 11 to 15 as relied upon by the plaintiffs, and claims 8 to 17 alleged by the defendant to be invalid, meets the requirements of s. 34 of the
Act
for disclosure.
5) The counterclaim of the defendant is dismissed.
[137]
I turn to the relief here sought by the plaintiffs. On the basis of my findings they are entitled to
a) a declaration that claims 1 to 5 and 8 to 15 of Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,275,349 have been infringed by the defendant;
b) a permanent injunction restraining the defendant by its officers, directors, servants, agents, employees or otherwise from infringing claims 1 to 5 and 8 to 15 of Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,275,349;
c) an order in appropriate terms for delivery up, or destruction under oath or under supervision of this court, of all compositions, that is, Apo-Enalapril products, not including bulk enalapril maleate held in inventory, within possession or control of the defendant that infringe Canadian Letters Patent 1,275,349;
d) damages or an accounting of the defendant's profits, to be determined on a reference pursuant to rule 500, as the plaintiffs elect, subject to the defendant's right to have the plaintiffs' entitlement to an election determined at trial in the discretion of this trial judge, in accord with the Order made January 27, 1994;
e) prejudgment and post-judgment interest; and
f) costs of the action on a party and party basis.
[138]
At the conclusion of trial in this matter, counsel suggested that formal judgment might most appropriately be considered after an opportunity for consultation between counsel, and if desirable a further appearance, before the court, concerning the terms of judgment in light of my findings and conclusions. That seems to me an appropriate course at this stage, in particular since judgment will be rendered after a delay following trial which was unanticipated and for which I express my regret.
[139]
In the circumstances, these reasons are filed with this final direction and an invitation to counsel for the plaintiffs to consult with counsel for the defendant on appropriate terms of the final judgment to be filed in light of my conclusions as set out in these Reasons. Counsel for plaintiffs should prepare a draft judgment, seek approval of counsel for the defendant as to its form and, if possible, its content, and submit the draft for consideration by the court. If counsel for either or both of the parties wishes to be heard on the matter, a hearing shall be arranged.
Judgment for plaintiffs;
counterclaim dismissed.
