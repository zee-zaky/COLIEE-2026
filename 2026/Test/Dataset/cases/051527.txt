Gibson, J.
: These reasons arise out of an application for judicial review of a decision of a deployment investigator in the Public Service Commission of Canada (the "Investigator") wherein the Investigator determined that a deployment action taken within the Department of Public Works and Government Services (the "Department") should be upheld and the complaint of the applicant herein with respect to the deployment action should be dismissed. This, despite the fact that the Investigator concluded her report (the "decision") in the following terms:
"However I fully understand Mr. Vavrecka's concern with the lack of opportunity to compete, especially in a time of restraint."
The decision is dated the 2nd day of February, 1995.
[2]
The
Public Service Employment Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33, was extensively amended by the
Public Service Reform Act
[see footnote 1] (the "amending
Act
"). Section 2(1) of the
Public Service Employment Act
(the "
Act
") was amended by the amending
Act
to add a definition of "deployment" in the following terms:
"'deployment' means the transfer of an employee from one position to another;"
A new Part III.1 entitled "Deployment" was added to the
Act
by the amending
Act
consisting of ss. 34.1 to 34.6. Section 34.1(1) vests in deputy heads:
"... the exclusive right and authority to make deployments to or within that part of the Public Service over which the deputy head has jurisdiction."
[3]
Section 34.2(1) provides as follows:
"34.2(1) Deployments shall be made in such manner as the Treasury Board may direct."
[4]
Section 34.3(1) provides a complaint procedure for employees "... in the work unit to which the deployment is made ..." with the complaint being directed to the deputy head concerned. The basis for such a complaint is specified to be that the deployment "... was not authorized by, or made in accordance with this
Act
or constituted an abuse of authority". Counsel before me were in agreement that the applicant herein is an employee entitled to bring a complaint with respect to the deployment in issue.
[5]
Sections 34.4 and 34.5 provide for referral of a complaint to the Public Service Commission, where the complainant is dissatisfied with the disposition of the complaint at the deputy head level, for an investigation on behalf of the Commission, and for a report of the investigation to the Commission. The decision here in issue is contained in such a report to the Commission.
[6]
The only issue in dispute before me was a rather narrow one. In essence, the outcome of this application for judicial review turns on whether the deployment in question was made "... in such manner as the Treasury Board [had] direct[ed]" as provided in s. 34.2(1) of the
Act
quoted above.
[7]
The Treasury Board's guidance to departments and their deputy heads in respect of deployments was, at all relevant times, contained in the Personnel Management component of the Treasury Board Manual under the headings "Human Resources" and "Deployment". Under the subheading "Policy Requirements" the following appears:
"Departments must establish deployment policies and procedures that respect the directives made by the Treasury Board ... and that:
. . . . .
- Provide for
advance notice
of upcoming deployment opportunities to employees in the work unit to which the deployments will be made." (underlining added by me for emphasis)
Appendix A to the relevant portion of the Treasury Board Manual is entitled "Treasury Board Directives for Deployment and Deployment Recourse". Under the subheading "Deployment", nothing further is said about advance notice of deployments. However, under the further subheading "Recourse", the following appears:
"Employees being deployed and employees in the work unit to which a deployment has been made or is about to be made shall be informed that the deployment has taken place or will take place no later than 10 working days from the effective date of the deployment and shall be given no less than 10 working days from the date they have been so informed within which to lodge complaints."
[8]
In Appendix B entitled "Deployment Guidelines", the following paragraph appears:
"In providing advance notice to employees of upcoming deployments, managers may use any form of notice that is appropriate to their organizations. Memos or E-mail notes, announcement at staff meetings and notices on bulletin boards are some examples. Managers may also wish to consider asking employees periodically if they are interested in deployment opportunities, keeping a list of those interested and consulting it before making a deployment. This is also considered appropriate notice."
[9]
In a draft deployment policy that the Department had in place at all times relevant to the deployment here in issue, no mandatory provision was made for notice to employees in advance of a deployment process. However, the draft policy did contain the following policy statement:
"2.1 Public Works Canada is committed to the use of deployments to meet operational needs; to fulfil the developmental and individual needs of employees; to develop the skills and abilities required by the organization in the longer term; and, to foster the achievement of employment equity goals.
"2.2 Delegated managers shall make deployments
in the spirit of fairness,
transparency and equity
, taking into account the needs and aspirations of their employees as well as operational considerations." (underlining added by me for emphasis)
The draft policy also contained the following provision:
"8.2 Employees being deployed and employees in the work unit to which a deployment has been made or is about to be made shall be informed that a deployment has taken place or will take place and shall be given a minimum of ten (10) working days from the date that they have been informed within which to lodge complaints. Notification of deployment can be verbal, written or public. It is recommended that written notification of deployment be used. This notification shall include the procedures to lodge a complaint and a contact person for further information."
No advance notice of the deployment process that resulted in the deployment here in issue was given to the applicant. Notice in accordance with s. 8.2 of the draft departmental policy quoted above was given and it was on the basis of that notice that the applicant instituted the complaint process finally resulting in this application for judicial review.
[10]
In her decision, under the heading Findings, the Investigator states:
"The lack of notice to employees in the work unit prior to the deployment taking place was a major concern to the complainant [the applicant] and his representative, a concern which I can fully understand given the limited number of opportunities. The draft departmental policy on deployment dated April 1, 1993 indicated that 'Managers may provide general notice to employees of upcoming deployment opportunities using any manner of notice' and a BULLETIN to ALL EMPLOYEES of April 1993 repeated similar information. It appears to me that the managers might have been encouraged to provide advance notice, however the policy does not state that it MUST be done."
The Investigator's conclusion in the foregoing quotation is beyond question. But it begs the further questions: was the draft policy in conformity with the requirements of Treasury Board policy? was it mandatory that the draft policy comply with Treasury Board policy? and was the deployment fatally flawed through failure to provide advance notice of the proposed deployment action to employees such as the applicant?
[11]
Treasury Board Policy clearly provides that departments must establish deployment policies and procedures that provide for advance notice of upcoming deployment opportunities. This is a requirement with respect to departmental policy, rather than a requirement with respect to the implementation of deployments. The draft departmental policy at issue here failed to comply with that requirement despite the fact that on its face it required managers to make deployments in the spirit of fairness, transparency and equity.
[12]
Section 34.2(1) of the
Act
is breached where a deployment is not made "in such manner as the Treasury Board may direct". It is arguable that, although the departmental policy did not include the provision for advance notice of upcoming deployment opportunities that Treasury Board Policy requires, this does not result in a breach of s. 34.2(1), as the deficiency in the departmental policy was with regard only to its policy rather than with respect to the "manner" of the deployment.
[13]
I conclude that this is a distinction without a difference. I find that where the Treasury Board directs that departmental policy must provide for advance notice of upcoming deployment opportunities, there is an implied direction that departments comply with their policies in making deployments. In the spirit of fairness, transparency and equity, as espoused by the departmental policy in question, advance notice of upcoming deployment opportunities is required.
[14]
I conclude that the Department simply cannot circumvent its obligations under s. 34.2(1) of the
Act
by failing to include in its policy, or draft policy as was the case here, a requirement that it was required by Treasury Board policy to include in its own departmental policy.
[15]
In the result, I determine that the Investigator erred in concluding that, because the draft departmental policy did not state that advance notice must be given, no advance notice was required. An advance notice provision was required to be included in the Department's policy. Failure to reflect that requirement on the face of the draft policy did not excuse the Department from the responsibility to provide advance notice of the deployment opportunity here in issue.
[16]
Counsel for the respondent urged that, even if I reached the conclusion, as I have, that advance notice of this deployment opportunity was required, I should not set aside the decision of the Investigator because even if the applicant had received advance notice of the deployment opportunity, he could not possibly have succeeded in obtaining the deployment for himself because his professional training was as an architect rather than as an engineer and the job description for the deployment opportunity provided for engineering qualifications as a prerequisite. I reject this argument. The deployment opportunity arose in connection with a newly created job description. If the applicant had received advance notice of the opportunity, it would have been open to him to argue that the restriction of the opportunity to those with engineering qualifications, as opposed to architectural qualifications, was unfair or unreasonable or both. It is not for me, on the evidence before me, to determine whether or not he might have been successful in such an argument. It is sufficient that he would have had the opportunity to put forward the argument and that opportunity was denied to him by the process adopted by the Department.
[17]
Based upon the foregoing background and analysis, I conclude that this application must be allowed. The decision of the Investigator will be set aside and the matter will be referred back to the Public Service Commission for redetermination in a manner not inconsistent with these reasons.
Application allowed.
