Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Martineau, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision rendered by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [tribunal] which found the applicant to be neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (as amended) [Act].
[2]
The applicant bases his refugee claim on the grounds of race, imputed political opinion, and membership in a particular social group. The applicant fears the army, the police, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Group [LTTE], and pro-government militant groups. Although the tribunal, alternatively, found the applicant not credible, it did not find in the first place that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution and would face a risk to his life upon return to Sri Lanka.
[3]
The main allegations of the applicant can be summarized in the following manner.
[4]
The applicant, a 23 year old Tamil male, is a citizen of Sri Lanka. He is from Point Pedro in northern Sri Lanka. The applicant's family is considered well-off and his father, who owns his own farm, cultivates onions and tobacco and his mother stays at home. He has a brother and two sisters who remain in Point Pedro with his father and mother.
[5]
The applicant left school in 2004 and began helping out on his father's farm. The LTTE was recruiting members in the area where the applicant lived, and he and his brother and two sisters faced pressure to participate in LTTE activities. The applicant's father was able to keep the LTTE away from his children by using bribes.
[6]
The applicant states that the police arrested him three times before his departure from Sri Lanka.
[7]
Firstly, in November 2007, the applicant was detained and questioned during two days regarding the killing of a shop owner and about his connection with the LTTE before being released. According to the applicant, several others that were arrested at the time were beaten and shot.
[8]
Secondly, in December 2007, afraid to have his son remain in Point Pedro, the applicant's father sent the applicant to stay with his uncle in the city of Colombo. Authorities in Colombo were nonetheless conducting numerous roundups and arrests. At one point, the police took the applicant to the police station, questioned him, and then released him that same day. Also while in Colombo the applicant states that he attended a private computer school where he took a two week computer course from home.
[9]
Thirdly, in June 2009, the police took the applicant to the police station and detained him for four days, beat him, questioned him, and accused him of LTTE connections. While detained at the police station, the applicant states that there was another Tamil civilian present. The applicant believes this individual to have been part of the Karuna group who helps the authorities combat the LTTE. His uncle eventually secured the applicant's release from the police by paying a bribe. After the incident, the applicant did not require medical attention.
[10]
On August 2, 2009, the applicant left Sri Lanka and travelled through nine countries before finally arriving in Canada where he has family. The applicant is unclear as to how much time was spent in each country on the way to Canada, but his route took him through Russia, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States (where he apparently made a refugee claim as well). The applicant arrived in Canada on or around June 17, 2010, and claimed protection in Montreal.
[11]
The tribunal dismissed the claim. In a nutshell, the tribunal concluded that the applicant's fear of the authorities, paramilitary groups, crime, violence, extortion and questioning upon his return, constituted a risk generally faced by all Sri Lankans and by all persons returning from abroad. Moreover, in view of the different contradictions, omissions and implausibilities in the evidence, as well as the lack of sufficient corroborative documents, the tribunal also found that the applicant was not credible and that he had not established a well-founded fear of persecution or personalized risk in the circumstances.
[12]
The applicant first takes issue with the conduct of the tribunal member during the hearing and alleges that the tribunal member conducted itself in an improper manner. Subsidiarily, the applicant submits that the conclusions of absence of personalized risk and non-credibility made by the tribunal are unreasonable. Key in the determination of absence of personalized risk made by the tribunal is the testimony of the applicant who "testified that he is not suspected of being an LTTE supporter" (paragraph 8).
[13]
For ease of convenience, I will deal separately with the allegation of bias or breach of procedural fairness, which is directly related to the questioning of the tribunal member who wanted to know if the applicant was suspected of being a LTTE supporter. I will first dispose of the applicant's subsidiary attack with respect to certain findings of mixed fact and law, or credibility, made by the tribunal; on these matters, the applicable standard of review is reasonableness.
[14]
Apart from the collateral attack concerning the manner used by the tribunal to ascertain whether the applicant was suspected of being an LTTE supporter, the applicant has not seriously challenged the reasonableness of the tribunal's conclusion of absence of personalized risk or persecution upon return to Sri Lanka. Considering the other components of the decision that have been addressed and overlap considerations of the risk that the applicant might face upon return, I find that the tribunal has taken due consideration of the documentary evidence. I do not intend to go into a lot of details. The reasons provided by the tribunal are articulate and convincing. I am also generally satisfied of the arguments made by the respondent in his memorandum. Thus, I will only make a few comments.
[15]
As noted by the tribunal, the documentary evidence regarding Sri Lanka paints a rather confusing picture of the situation in the country as to who is at risk and why. The tribunal stated it preferred the
UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection needs of Asylum Seekers from Sri Lanka
[UNHCR guidelines]. The UNHCR guidelines addresses five potential risk profiles, none of which apply to the applicant for the reasons provided by the tribunal who has taken the time to meticulously examine the evidence, including the risk of persons who may have the profile of a LTTE supporter.
[16]
In this regard, the tribunal recognizes that persons suspected of having links with the LTTE "are likely to undergo questioning and during these questioning sessions may be subjected to physical and emotional abuse and torture. "However, as noted by the tribunal, the applicant "testified that he is not suspected of being an LTTE supporter." The tribunal found further corroboration of the fact that he was never really suspected of being a LTTE supporter - and that his previous arrests were random - from the fact that he was released: "If there was any chance of him being a LTTE supporter in any form, he would not have been released as he was" (paragraph 81). This settles the past persecution, but the fear of persecution must be forward looking and the risk must be personalized.
[17]
Certainly, the applicant risks arrests and questioning by the authorities upon return to Sri Lanka, and certainly he has been abusively held by the police in the past, but the applicant has not sufficiently demonstrated to the satisfaction of the tribunal how he has been specifically and personally targeted to merit a determination of personalized risk. Arrest scenarios are plausible but also appear to be randomized. As the tribunal points out, two aspects would create a heightened level of risk for the applicant: his refusal to help the criminals and the apparent presence of a civilian belonging to the Karuna group during questioning at his third arrest. However, it appears that the applicant has only surmised that this individual was a member of the Karuna group and that this might cause problems for him upon return. The tribunal also noted that the other members of the applicant's family, including his brother and two sisters, do continue to live in Point Pedro without facing heightened difficulties. Save for inquiries made to the applicant's uncle and police as to the location of the applicant, it was not unreasonable for the tribunal to conclude that the applicant has not sufficiently demonstrated that he faced more than a generalized risk.
[18]
The tribunal also found, in the alternative, that the applicant lacked credibility after conducting a credibility analysis separately. The grounds upon which the tribunal determined the applicant lacked credibility can be summarized as follows: (1) numerous contradictory statements and omissions in relation to aspects such as the account of his work experience and study permit in Colombo, details about his arrests in Sri Lanka, the ability of his brother and sisters to live safely in Sri Lanka, the details of his journey to Canada, the refugee claim he apparently made in the United States; (2) the contradiction in his response at the hearing that the Sri Lankan government did not suspect him of being an LTTE supporter while he had already described himself as being suspected; (3) the applicant's failure to ask for asylum in the nine different countries (linked to safe third country grounds); (4) his failure to provide adequate corroborative documents; and (5) the documentary evidence relating to the current situation in Sri Lanka, which the tribunal member sees as indicating an unlikelihood of persecution for Tamils due to a Convention ground (essentially, amounting to a change in circumstances).
[19]
It is well-established that decisions of the tribunal as to credibility are by nature factual and are thus owed a significant amount of deference. Reasonableness demands justification, transparency, and intelligibility in the decision-making process, which I ultimately find to be present in the tribunal member's decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). While I do find that some statements made by the tribunal may somewhat touch on details, nonetheless, the totality of the reasoning is based on the evidence and the credibility findings and absence of subjective fear falls within the range of acceptable outcomes.
[20]
This brings me to the main argument of attack against the legality of the impugned decision.
[21]
At the hearing before the Court, applicant's counsel recognized that the applicable test for bias, as set out in the relevant case law, was not met, but insisted that the tribunal member was nevertheless unfair at the hearing. When the applicant testified that he was arrested, detained and beaten by the authorities since they accused him of having links or supporting the LTTE Tigers, the applicant's counsel argues that the tribunal member threatened to inform the Minister that there is possibility of exclusion.
[22]
As the allegation against the tribunal member deals with bias or procedural fairness, it will be measured against a standard of correctness and upon a close examination of the transcripts of the hearing. Any particular comments of the tribunal member with respect to exclusion will have to be read in light of the totality of the evidence, including the answers given by the applicant, as well as the overall conduct at the hearing of the tribunal member.
[23]
I note that at page 18 of the transcripts, the tribunal member and applicant have the following exchange in relation to the allegations of severe beating by the police:
MEMBER
: You say sir here in your story that you were beaten severely. Did you need medical attention if you were beaten severely?
CLAIMANT
: No
MEMBER
: And how is that possible? If somebody is beaten severely that person needs medical attention.
CLAIMANT
: They were inquiring about the happening in Jaffna, they [
sic
] and they were also questioning whether I was support [
sic
] the Liberation Tigers or those Tigers who have escaped from the camp. When I was giving the details they were hitting me by their hands and by feet.
MEMBER
: When did you get into USA?
[24]
The tribunal member clearly passes to another subject. He does not "threaten" the applicant. He continues to question the applicant concerning the apparent contradictions with respect to the date of the third arrest, whether it was in June or July of 2009 (pages 17, 18, and 19).
[25]
Later on in the hearing, during the questioning conducted by the applicant about his third arrest, the tribunal member interjects in the following way at page 34 of the transcripts, but does not pursue the question further:
COUNSEL
: So what did you tell them?
CLAIMANT
: I indicated that [ph] I have no link with them whatsoever and they said that those who have come from Jaffna are trying to build up the tigers again and the threatened that they will kill me [
sic
].
MEMBER
: Sir if the government thinks that you have ties to the Tigers I can inform the minister that there is a possibility of exclusion and let them get involved. Does the government think that you are an LTTE supporter?
CLAIMANT
: No. They inquired me [
sic
] and then they left me.
[26]
Learned applicant's counsel now uses the above extract to explain to this Court that the reply of "No" given by the applicant in response to the query of the tribunal member as to whether or not the government thought he was linked to the LTTE was the result of fear induced when faced with the threat of being excluded, and should not be used later by the tribunal in order to note that the applicant contradicted himself.
[27]
The applicant submits that the tribunal member should have notified the Minister under Rule 23 of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, SOR/2002-228 of any doubts regarding the applicant's affiliations prior to the hearing since no new facts were raised at the hearing that were not in the applicant's Personal Information Form [PIF]. The applicant contends that this alleged breach affects the entirety of the tribunal's decision before us today because the applicant would fit the profile of persons who are suspected of being LTTE supporters, which puts him at risk if he returns to Sri Lanka.
[28]
I am unable to find any breach of procedural fairness. The applicant was under oath and had the obligation to tell the truth - regardless of any alleged sudden panic. He must tell the truth all the time; otherwise, if he contradicts himself - like he apparently did - how can the tribunal member know when he is telling the truth and when he is lying to the tribunal? Overall, I do not find that the questioning of the tribunal member was improper in the circumstances. There was nothing wrong in asking: "Does the government think that you are an LTTE supporter?"
[29]
The tribunal member already had a number of legitimate concerns regarding the credibility of the applicant who had difficulty providing details about the third arrest and had provided either contradictory or confusing answers. It is an exaggeration to say, in this instance, that the tribunal member induced the applicant to lie in order to avoid the possibility of being excluded. Indeed, there is no indication on record from the applicant, or counsel for the applicant, that there was any concern with bias or improper conduct on the part of the tribunal member during the hearing.
[30]
Regarding the tribunal's general obligation to inform the applicant and his counsel if an exclusion matter becomes an issue, it was within the tribunal's discretion at the hearing to proceed on the basis of the evidence presented before it. The applicant was not seeking an adjournment. After all, the applicant testified that he was beaten by the authorities who suspected him of having links with the LTTE Tigers. The matter of exclusion was immediately closed following the prompt negative answer given by the applicant who explained that the police had decided to release him after the interrogation.
[31]
In conclusion, there is no reasonable apprehension of bias or breach of procedural fairness on the part of the tribunal member who decided the claim. Having closely examined the hearing transcript, rather than having acted in an improper manner, I find that the tribunal member was cooperative, accommodating, and clearly identified areas where credibility may have been an issue during the course of the hearing. Overall, I find the conclusions of the tribunal - that the applicant's risk is only generalized and that he is not credible - to be an acceptable outcome in light of the evidence on record and the law.
[32]
For these reasons, the present application must fail. Counsel agree that there is no question of general importance raised in this case.
JUDGMENT
[33]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the present application is dismissed. No question is certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire visant la décision par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [le tribunal] a conclu que le demandeur n'était ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (en sa version modifiée) [la Loi].
[2]
Le demandeur fonde sa demande d'asile sur les motifs de la race, des opinions politiques imputées et de l'appartenance à un groupe social particulier. Le demandeur dit craindre l'armée, la police, les Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul [les TLET] et des groupes militants progouvernementaux. Tout en concluant de manière subsidiaire que le demandeur n'était pas crédible, le tribunal a conclu avant tout que celui-ci n'avait pas une crainte fondée de persécution et que sa vie ne serait pas menacée s'il devait retourner au Sri Lanka.
[3]
Je vais maintenant résumer les principales allégations du demandeur.
[4]
Le demandeur, un Tamoul âgé de 23 ans, est citoyen du Sri Lanka. Il est originaire de Point Pedro, au nord de ce pays et serait issu d'une famille aisée. Son père possède sa propre ferme, où il fait la culture des oignons et du tabac, tandis que sa mère reste au foyer. Il a un frère et deux sœurs qui sont toujours à Point Pedro avec leur père et leur mère.
[5]
En 2004, le demandeur a quitté l'école et a commencé à aider son père à la ferme. Les TLET recrutaient des membres dans la région où vivait le demandeur, et ils ont exercé des pressions sur ce dernier, son frère et ses sœurs pour qu'ils participent à leurs activités. Le père du demandeur a pu tenir les TLET éloignés de ses enfants en leur versant des pots-de-vin.
[6]
Le demandeur affirme avoir été arrêté trois fois par la police avant qu'il ne quitte le Sri Lanka.
[7]
Premièrement, le demandeur a été mis en détention en novembre 2007 et on ne l'a relâché qu'après l'avoir interrogé pendant deux jours au sujet du meurtre d'un commerçant et de ses liens avec les TLET. Selon le demandeur, plusieurs autres personnes arrêtées à la même époque ont été battues et tuées par balle.
[8]
Deuxièmement, en décembre 2007, le père du demandeur, craignant pour ce dernier s'il devait rester à Point Pedro, l'a envoyé demeurer chez un oncle à Colombo. Dans cette ville, les autorités procédaient néanmoins à de nombreuses rafles et arrestations. À une occasion, des policiers ont conduit le demandeur à un poste de police pour l'interroger, puis ils l'ont relâché le jour même. Par ailleurs, le demandeur déclare qu'à Colombo, il a suivi depuis la maison un cours d'informatique de deux semaines dispensé par une école privée d'informatique.
[9]
Troisièmement, en juin 2009, des policiers ont conduit de nouveau le demandeur à un poste de police, où on l'a détenu pendant quatre jours, battu, interrogé et accusé d'avoir des liens avec les TLET. Le demandeur déclare qu'un autre Tamoul était présent au poste de police pendant sa détention, un civil qu'il croit avoir été membre du groupe Karuna, qui aide les autorités dans leur lutte contre les TLET. Le demandeur a finalement été relâché, après que son oncle eut versé un pot-de-vin à la police. Le demandeur n'a pas eu besoin de soins médicaux après cet incident.
[10]
Le 2 août 2009, le demandeur a quitté le Sri Lanka. Il s'est rendu dans neuf pays avant d'arriver finalement au Canada, où il compte de la famille. Le demandeur est vague quant à la durée de son séjour dans ces divers pays avant sa venue au Canada, mais son itinéraire l'a conduit en Russie, en Équateur, en Colombie, au Panama, au Guatemala, au Mexique et aux États-Unis (où il semble avoir aussi présenté une demande d'asile). Le demandeur est arrivé au Canada vers le 17 juin 2010 et il a demandé l'asile à Montréal.
[11]
Le tribunal a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur. En bref, il a conclu que la crainte du demandeur à l'égard des autorités, des groupes paramilitaires, de la criminalité, de la violence, de l'extorsion et des interrogatoires advenant un retour dans son pays était liée à un risque auquel sont exposés tous les Sri Lankais de manière générale, notamment ceux qui reviennent de l'étranger. Compte tenu en outre des diverses contradictions, omissions et invraisemblances entachant la preuve, et faute de documents corroborants suffisants, le tribunal a également conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible et qu'il n'avait pas démontré qu'il avait une crainte fondée de persécution, ni qu'en l'espèce il était personnellement exposé à un risque.
[12]
Le demandeur met d'abord en cause la conduite du commissaire, qu'il qualifie d'irrégulière, pendant l'audience. Il soutient subsidiairement qu'étaient déraisonnables les conclusions tirées par le tribunal quant à son manque de crédibilité et quant à l'absence de risque personnalisé. Un élément clé de la conclusion d'absence de risque personnalisé a été le témoignage du demandeur, au cours duquel celui-ci « a déclaré ne pas être soupçonné d'être un partisan des TLET » (au paragraphe 8).
[13]
Par souci de commodité, je vais traiter de manière distincte de l'allégation de partialité ou de manquement à l'équité procédurale, directement liée aux questions posées par le commissaire pour savoir si l'on soupçonnait le demandeur d'être un partisan des TLET. Je vais d'abord me prononcer sur la contestation subsidiaire par le demandeur de certaines conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit, ou de conclusions relatives à la crédibilité, tirées par le tribunal; à cet égard, la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la raisonnabilité.
[14]
Mis à part la contestation accessoire de la manière utilisée par le tribunal pour savoir si on le soupçonnait d'être un partisan des TLET, le demandeur n'a pas sérieusement mis en question le caractère raisonnable de la conclusion du tribunal quant à l'absence de risque personnalisé ou de persécution advenant son retour au Sri Lanka. Compte tenu des autres éléments examinés dans la décision et recoupant les facteurs considérés quant au risque couru par le demandeur s'il devait retourner dans son pays, je conclus que le tribunal a dûment pris en compte la preuve documentaire. Je n'entends pas entrer dans les détails. Les motifs du tribunal sont clairs et convaincants. Je souscris aussi de manière générale aux arguments formulés par le défendeur dans son mémoire. Je ne formulerai donc que quelques commentaires.
[15]
Comme l'a relevé le tribunal, il se dégage de la preuve documentaire relative au Sri Lanka une image assez confuse des personnes qui sont exposées à un risque dans ce pays et des motifs pour lesquels elles le sont. Le tribunal a déclaré privilégier comme source les
UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection needs of Asylum Seekers from Sri Lanka
[principes directeurs du HCR]. On peut trouver dans ces principes directeurs du HCR cinq profils de risque éventuel au Sri Lanka. Le tribunal a précisé pour quels motifs aucun de ces profils ne correspondait à celui du demandeur, en prenant le temps d'examiner minutieusement la preuve, notamment ce qui touche le risque couru par un partisan des TLET.
[16]
Le tribunal a reconnu à cet égard que les individus soupçonnés d'avoir des liens avec les TLET étaient « susceptibles de subir des interrogatoires, au cours desquels ils peuvent être soumis à des violences et à de la torture physiques et psychologiques ». Comme l'a toutefois fait remarquer le tribunal, le demandeur « a déclaré ne pas être soupçonné d'être un partisan des TLET ». Le tribunal a conclu que la remise en liberté du demandeur confirmait le fait qu'on n'avait jamais véritablement soupçonné ce dernier d'être un partisan des TLET - et qu'on l'avait toujours arrêté au hasard: « S'il y avait eu la moindre chance qu'il soit un partisan des TLET de quelque manière que ce soit, il n'aurait pas été mis en liberté comme il l'a été » (au paragraphe 81). Cela règle la question de la persécution passée, mais la crainte de persécution doit être évaluée de manière prospective et le risque doit être personnalisé.
[17]
Il ne fait pas de doute que le demandeur risque d'être arrêté et interrogé par les autorités à son retour au Sri Lanka et que, dans le passé, la police a abusé de son pouvoir pour le mettre en détention. Le demandeur n'a toutefois pas réussi à convaincre le tribunal que, comme auparavant il a été pris expressément et personnellement pour cible, on peut qualifier de personnalisé le risque auquel il serait exposé. Il est plausible que le demandeur sera arrêté, mais c'est au hasard qu'on semble procéder aux arrestations. Le tribunal a relevé que deux éléments accroissaient le risque couru par le demandeur: le refus de ce dernier d'aider les criminels et la présence apparente d'un civil membre du groupe Karuna pendant l'interrogatoire à la troisième arrestation. Le demandeur semble toutefois avoir simplement supposé que le civil était membre de ce groupe et que cela pourrait lui occasionner des problèmes advenant son retour. Le tribunal a également souligné que les autres membres de la famille du demandeur, y compris son frère et ses deux sœurs, continuaient de vivre à Point Pedro sans y être exposés à de plus grandes difficultés. Si l'on fait exception de demandes faites à l'oncle et à la police pour savoir où le demandeur se trouvait, il n'était pas déraisonnable pour le tribunal de conclure que le demandeur n'avait pas suffisamment établi qu'il courrait davantage qu'un risque généralisé.
[18]
Le tribunal a aussi conclu subsidiairement, après avoir analysé de manière distincte la question de la crédibilité, que le demandeur n'était guère crédible. Les motifs pour lesquels le tribunal a jugé le demandeur peu crédible peuvent être résumés comme suit: (1) de nombreuses déclarations contradictoires et omissions concernant notamment le récit fait par le demandeur de son expérience professionnelle et du permis d'études dont il disposait à Colombo, les précisions données au sujet de ses arrestations au Sri Lanka, la capacité du frère et des sœurs du demandeur de vivre en sécurité au Sri Lanka, les détails du trajet effectué par le demandeur à destination du Canada, la demande d'asile que ce dernier aurait présentée aux États-Unis; (2) les contradictions du demandeur, qui a expliqué à l'audience que le gouvernement sri lankais ne le soupçonnait pas d'être un partisan des TLET alors qu'il avait déjà dit lui-même qu'il était visé par de tels soupçons; (3) le défaut du demandeur de demander l'asile dans les neuf autres pays où il s'était rendu (les motifs en lien avec les tiers pays sûrs); (4) le défaut du demandeur de produire des documents corroborants appropriés; (5) la preuve documentaire sur la situation actuelle au Sri Lanka démontrant, selon le commissaire, qu'il est improbable que les Tamouls y subissent de la persécution pour un motif lié à la Convention (ce qui équivaut essentiellement à un changement de situation).
[19]
Il est bien établi que les décisions du tribunal quant à la crédibilité sont de nature factuelle, et qu'on doit donc faire preuve d'une grande retenue à leur endroit. Le caractère raisonnable tient à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), des attributs présents, comme j'en conclus en dernière analyse, dans la décision du commissaire. Quoique le tribunal aurait pu davantage étoffer certaines de ses déclarations, j'estime néanmoins que l'ensemble de son raisonnement s'appuie sur la preuve et que les conclusions tirées quant à la crédibilité et à l'absence de crainte subjective appartiennent aux issues possibles acceptables.
[20]
Cela m'amène au principal argument avancé pour contester la légalité de la décision.
[21]
Devant la Cour, l'avocat du demandeur a reconnu qu'il n'était pas satisfait en l'espèce au critère de la partialité établi par la jurisprudence, mais il a insisté pour dire que le commissaire s'était néanmoins montré inéquitable à l'audience. L'avocat fait ainsi valoir que, lorsque le demandeur a déclaré dans son témoignage que les autorités l'avaient fait arrêter, détenir et frapper parce qu'elles l'accusaient d'avoir des liens avec les TLET ou d'en être un partisan, le commissaire a menacé d'informer le ministre qu'il pouvait y avoir matière à exclusion.
[22]
L'allégation portée contre le commissaire ayant trait à la partialité ou à l'équité procédurale, il faudra l'examiner selon la norme de la décision correcte et se pencher attentivement sur la transcription de l'audience. On devra interpréter tout commentaire particulier du commissaire concernant l'exclusion en tenant compte de l'ensemble de la preuve, y compris les réponses données par le demandeur, et du comportement général du commissaire à l'audience.
[23]
Je relève l'échange suivant (à la page 18 de la transcription) entre le commissaire et le demandeur au sujet des allégations de passage à tabac par la police:
[traduction]
COMMISSAIRE
: Vous dites monsieur dans votre récit qu'on vous a roué de coups. Avez-vous eu besoin à cause de cela de soins médicaux?
DEMANDEUR D'ASILE
: Non.
COMMISAIRE
: Comment est-ce possible? Lorsqu'une personne est rouée de coups, elle a besoin de soins médicaux.
DEMANDEUR D'ASILE
: Ils voulaient savoir ce qui se passait à Jaffna, et me demandaient aussi si j'appuyais les Tigres de libération, ou encore ceux d'entre eux qui s'étaient enfuis du camp. Lorsque je donnais des précisions, ils me frappaient avec leurs mains et avec leurs pieds.
COMMISSAIRE
: Quand êtes-vous entré aux États-Unis?
[24]
Le commissaire change manifestement de sujet. Il ne « menace » pas le demandeur. Il continue de l'interroger au sujet d'apparentes contradictions quant au moment - juillet ou août 2009 - où se serait produite la troisième arrestation (pages 17, 18 et 19).
[25]
Plus tard à l'audience, lors de l'interrogatoire mené par le demandeur relativement à sa troisième arrestation, le commissaire est intervenu comme suit (page 34 de la transcription) sans toutefois revenir sur la question:
[traduction]
AVOCAT
: Alors, que leur avez-vous dit?
DEMANDEUR D'ASILE
: J'ai déclaré n'avoir aucun lien quelconque avec eux, puis ils ont dit que ceux qui venaient de Jaffna tentaient de mettre les Tigres sur pied de nouveau, et ils ont menacé de me tuer.
COMMISSAIRE
: Monsieur, si le gouvernement pense que vous avez des liens avec les Tigres, je peux informer le ministre qu'il pourrait y avoir matière à exclusion et le laisser intervenir. Le gouvernement vous croit-il être un partisan des TLET?
DEMANDEUR D'ASILE
: Non. On m'a interrogé, puis on m'a laissé tranquille.
[26]
L'avocat du demandeur cite maintenant l'extrait ci-dessus pour expliquer à la Cour que, si le demandeur a répondu [traduction] « Non » lorsque le commissaire lui a demandé si le gouvernement le croyait lié aux TLET, c'était en raison de la crainte suscitée par la menace d'exclusion, et que le tribunal n'aurait pas dû ensuite invoquer cette réponse pour affirmer que le demandeur se contredisait.
[27]
Le demandeur affirme que le commissaire aurait dû informer le ministre de tout soupçon concernant ses affiliations avant l'audience, en application de l'article 23 des
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-228, puisqu'au cours de l'audience, aucun fait nouveau n'avait été présenté qui ne figurait pas dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels. Le demandeur soutient que ce manquement aurait influé sur la décision du tribunal en son entier, puisqu'il aurait sinon correspondu au profil des personnes soupçonnées de sympathiser avec les TLET, ce qui l'exposerait à un risque advenant son retour au Sri Lanka.
[28]
Je ne puis conclure qu'il y a eu le moindre manquement à l'équité procédurale. Le demandeur a déposé sous serment et il était tenu de dire la vérité - abstraction faite de toute panique soudaine invoquée. Le demandeur doit toujours dire la vérité. Sinon, s'il se contredit, comme tel semble avoir été le cas en l'espèce, comment le commissaire pourrait-il savoir quand il ment et quand il dit la vérité? J'estime que dans l'ensemble les questions posées par le commissaire n'étaient pas inappropriées dans les circonstances. Il n'y avait rien de mal à demander: [traduction] « Le gouvernement vous croit-il être un partisan des TLET? ».
[29]
Le commissaire avait déjà diverses raisons légitimes de douter de la crédibilité du demandeur, qui avait eu du mal à donner des précisions au sujet de la troisième arrestation et dont certaines réponses étaient contradictoires ou confuses. Il serait exagéré de dire qu'en l'espèce, le commissaire a incité le demandeur à mentir pour éviter de faire l'objet d'une mesure d'exclusion. D'ailleurs, rien au dossier n'indique qu'à l'audience le demandeur ou son avocat a exprimé la moindre inquiétude quant à la partialité du commissaire ou à une conduite irrégulière de sa part.
[30]
Quant à l'obligation générale du tribunal d'informer le demandeur et son avocat si une question d'exclusion se soulevait, le tribunal disposait du pouvoir discrétionnaire d'agir à l'audience en fonction de la preuve qui lui était présentée. Le demandeur n'a pas demandé d'ajournement. Après tout, le demandeur avait déclaré dans son témoignage que les autorités qui l'avaient fait tabasser le soupçonnaient d'avoir des liens avec les TLET. Il n'a d'ailleurs plus été question d'exclusion dès que, l'instant d'après, le demandeur a répondu par la négative et expliqué que la police avait décidé de le relâcher après l'avoir interrogé.
[31]
En conclusion, il n'y a pas matière à crainte raisonnable de partialité de la part du commissaire qui s'est prononcé sur la demande d'asile, et celui-ci n'a pas manqué à l'équité procédurale. Après avoir examiné la transcription de l'audience avec soin, je conclus que le commissaire, plutôt que d'avoir agi irrégulièrement, s'est montré coopératif et conciliant et a clairement relevé à l'audience les diverses sources d'inquiétude en matière de crédibilité. Dans l'ensemble, je conclus que les conclusions tirées par le tribunal - le demandeur est uniquement exposé à un risque généralisé et il n'est pas crédible - constituent une issue acceptable au regard de la preuve au dossier et du droit.
[32]
Pour ces motifs, la présente demande doit être rejetée. Les avocats conviennent que la présente affaire ne soulève aucune question de portée générale.
