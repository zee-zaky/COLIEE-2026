Strickland, J.
: This is an appeal by Wei Zhou (Applicant), brought pursuant to subsection 14(5) of the
Citizenship Act
, RSC 1985, c C-29 (the Act), of the decision of a citizenship judge denying her application for citizenship. The denial was based on the Applicant's failure to achieve the required passing grade on the citizenship test and, thereby, to demonstrate that she has adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship as required by subsection 5(1)(e) of the Act. The present appeal is brought in accordance with section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC 1985, c F-7 and Rule 300(c) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106 (the Rules).
Background
[2]
In 1999 the Applicant came to Canada as a student. She became a permanent resident on October 17, 2003 and in 2010 submitted a citizenship application, which was received by the Respondent on July 9, 2010. By way of a notice dated September 14, 2011, the Applicant was directed to write a citizenship test on September 29, 2011. She advised the Respondent that she was unable to attend as she would be away from Canada from June 28, 2011 to March 2012. She was then directed to appear on December 28, 2011 at a hearing before a citizenship judge.
[3]
The Applicant attended as directed and a citizenship test was administered by Citizenship Judge George Khouri (Citizenship Judge). By letter dated April 26, 2012, the Applicant was notified by the Citizenship Judge that her application was not approved because she had not demonstrated, through her responses to questions prepared by the Minister, the requisite level of knowledge per subsection 5(1)(e) of the Act. More specifically, the Applicant had answered only thirteen out of twenty questions correctly, obtaining a score of 65%, and thereby failing to obtain the required passing grade of 75% (the Decision).
[4]
The Applicant appealed and, in support of her application for judicial review of the Decision, filed an affidavit wherein she stated that that she had correctly answered all of the test questions and that the Citizenship Judge had made statements during the interview which, she argued in her application, gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.
The Impugned Decision
[5]
In his Decision, the Citizenship Judge advised the Applicant that he was providing her with notice of his decision in accordance with subsection 14(3) of the Act. He set out the legislative requirements that were relevant to her application and the Decision and explained that subsection 5(1)(e) requires an applicant for citizenship to have an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. Further, the Citizenship Judge indicated that pursuant to subsection 15(1) of the
Citizenship Regulations
, SOR/93-246 a person is considered to have adequate knowledge of Canada if they demonstrate, based on their responses to questions prepared by the Minister, that they know the national symbols of Canada and have a general knowledge of specified subjects, and, pursuant to subsection 15(2) of the
Citizenship Regulations,
if they similarly demonstrate an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship.
[6]
The Citizenship Judge concluded by stating:
The citizenship test questions on knowledge of Canada and of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship are based on information provided in the study guide,
Discover Canada: The Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship
. The citizenship test consists of 20 questions and the pass mark is of 75% (15 questions answered correctly out of 20 questions).
At the hearing, I asked you questions based on questions prepared by the Minister to determine if you met the requirement of paragraph 5(1)(e) of the Act and you obtained 13 out of 20 resulting in a score of 65%. You were unable to answer correctly to questions related to the following topics:
• voting procedures and how to register yourself as a voter;
• Canada's history;
• Canada's geography; and
• the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship
For those reasons, you do not meet the requirements of paragraph 5(1)(e) of the
Citizenship Act
in order to be granted Canadian citizenship.
[...]
Issues and Standard of Review
[7]
The Applicant submits that there are three issues; the Respondent adds a fourth:
i. Did the Citizenship Judge err in law and lose jurisdiction to refuse the citizenship application because he failed to render his Decision within 60 days as required by subsection 14(1) of the Act?
ii. Did the Citizenship Judge err by failing to provide adequate reasons for his Decision?
iii. Was the Citizenship Judge biased?
iv. Did the Citizenship Judge err in finding that the Applicant had failed to obtain the minimum pass mark on the citizenship test and thereby failed to satisfy subsection 5(1)(e) of the Act?
[8]
Given the guidance of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the reasons offered for a decision are to be assessed along with the outcome of that decision to determine whether the decision as a whole is reasonable, "adequacy of reasons" is no longer a stand-alone ground for challenging a decision. As such, I find that the second and fourth issues should be considered together and would rephrase the issues as follows:
i. Did the Citizenship Judge err in law and lose jurisdiction to refuse the citizenship application because he failed to render his Decision within 60 days as required by subsection 14(1) of the Act?
ii. Was the Citizenship Judge's finding that the Applicant had failed to obtain the minimum pass mark on the citizenship test and thereby failed to satisfy subsection 5(1)(e) of the Act reasonable?
iii. Has the Applicant satisfied the burden of establishing that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Citizenship Judge?
[9]
The Supreme Court of Canada has held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[10]
It is well-established that a citizenship judge's finding that an applicant failed a citizenship test is to be measured against a standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[11]
When reviewing a decision on the reasonableness standard, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47 and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[12]
In contrast, no such deference is owed to an administrative decision-maker on issues of procedural fairness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 43;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Thus, the question of whether the Citizenship Judge was biased will be assessed on the standard of correctness.
[13]
For the reasons set out below, the standard of review applicable to the jurisdictional issue need not be addressed.
Analysis
i)
Loss of Jurisdiction
[14]
In her written submissions the Applicant argued that the Citizenship Judge had lost jurisdiction to decide on her citizenship application because he had not rendered the Decision within sixty days as required by subsection 14(1) of the Act
.
However, at the hearing before this Court, the Applicant conceded that this was solely an issue of costs, and not one of jurisdiction or procedural fairness.
ii)
The Reasonableness of the Citizenship Judge's Decision
[15]
Prior to assessing the reasonableness of the Decision, I will first set out what properly forms part of the record before me. This requires background regarding a confidentiality issue and a ruling on the appropriateness of content in a proffered affidavit.
[16]
First, in terms of the confidentiality issue, the specific questions that the Citizenship Judge determined were answered incorrectly by the Applicant were not disclosed in his reasons nor was the citizenship test that had been administered provided as a part of the certified tribunal record (CTR). The CTR was provided to the parties and filed with the Federal Court Registry by way of a covering letter dated July 10, 2012 from Ms. Anna Del Medico, Citizenship Counsellor, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). In that letter, Ms. Del Medico specifically noted that pages 06, 07 and 08 of the record had been omitted in their entirety as they contained the Applicant's responses to the citizenship test. Pursuant to Rule 318(2), CIC objected to the release of that information on the grounds that its disclosure would jeopardise the integrity of the test.
[17]
Rule 317 states that a party may request that it be provided with material relevant to an application that is in the possession of a tribunal whose decision is the subject of the application. This can be done as a part of its notice of application as was the case in this matter. Rule 318(2) states that where the tribunal objects to a Rule 317 request it shall inform all parties of the reason for the objection.
[18]
Although CIC objected to the disclosure of the citizenship test when the CTR was produced, on September 7, 2012 the Respondent brought a motion seeking a confidentiality order concerning the citizenship test. This would permit the filing of a sealed and confidential copy of the test and review of the test, in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality order, by counsel and the parties. The Applicant opposed that motion.
[19]
By order dated October 2, 2012 Prothonotary Milczynski indicated that she was satisfied that it was in the public interest to maintain the confidentiality of the information sought to be sealed so as to ensure the integrity of the citizenship testing process. She ordered CIC to file the pages not included in the original CTR (the citizenship test) with the Court to be sealed and treated as confidential pursuant to Rule 152. Upon the filing of written undertakings of counsel in accordance with Rule 152(2)(b), the solicitors of record and the parties would be permitted to access the sealed pages, referred to as the Confidential CTR Material.
[20]
The confidential citizenship test was duly filed with the Court on October 5, 2012 and the solicitor for the Respondent subsequently filed the required written undertaking. The solicitor for the Applicant did not file an undertaking. At the time of the hearing before this Court neither counsel for the Applicant nor the Applicant had reviewed the subject citizenship test.
[21]
The Applicant argues that she disagrees with the Order of the Prothonotary that it is a matter of public interest to maintain as confidential the citizenship test questions and asserts that there is no authority or direction provided by the Minister to do so. However, what is before me is the appeal of the Citizenship Judge's Decision, not an appeal of the Prothonotary's Order, with which I agree in any case.
[22]
On September 13, 2012 the Applicant brought a motion challenging an affidavit of Ms. Del Medico, dated August 15, 2012. That affidavit was filed by the Respondent as a part of its record. Attached as Exhibit "A" to the affidavit was the July 10, 2012 letter from Ms. Del Medico providing the parties with the CTR. The Applicant sought to have paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the affidavit struck out pursuant to Rule 81 as she alleged that those paragraphs were not made within the affiant's personal knowledge. By Order dated October 2, 2012 Prothonotary Milczynski dismissed the motion on the basis that the issue should be addressed by the Judge hearing the appeal on its merits.
[23]
Before this Court, the Applicant asserted that the affidavit was inadmissible as it was intended to bolster the record and the reasons of the Citizenship Judge. Further, the Applicant argues that because the CTR, including the citizenship test, are exhibits to the affidavit they too are inadmissible and do not comprise a part of the record that can be reviewed by this Court in this appeal. In short, the Applicant contends that there is no admissible evidence as to the outcome of the citizenship test other than the unchallenged affidavit of the Applicant stating that she correctly answered all of the test questions.
[24]
The affidavit reads as follows:
I, Anna Del Medico, Citizenship Officer, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Scarborough Citizenship, SWEAR THAT:
1. I am employed with the Government of Canada at the local office of Citizenship and Immigration Canada ("CIC") in Scarborough. I am Citizenship Officer and responsible for responding to requests for documents in possession of our office. As such, I have knowledge of the matters thereafter deposed.
2. The Applicant is appealing the decision of Citizenship Judge George Khouri. On his notice of application the applicant requested that CIC Scarborough Citizenship office at 200 Town Centre Court, Suite 370 Scarborough ON M1P 4X8 send to the parties and the Registry of the Federal Court a certified copy of the Citizenship Judge's complete file relating to the Applicant's citizenship application.
3. As a Citizenship Officer, it is my responsibility to prepare the true copies of documents requested by the Applicant. I reviewed the citizenship file and prepared a true copy of this file. I sent the letter dated July 10, 2012 and addressed to the Registry, Federal Court of Canada, certifying the record. I also sent the certified true copy of the record with the letter to the parties and the Court.
4. Attached as Exhibit "A" is a true copy of the certified tribunal record previously sent to the parties and the Court.
5. When I put together the Certified Tribunal Record and filed the documents with the Federal Court registry on July 7, 2012, I redacted the list of questions used and annotated by Citizenship Judge George Khouri in assessing the Applicant's knowledge of Canada pursuant to section 318(2) of the Federal Court Rules.
6. In order to ensure fair treatment to all applicants and to ensure the integrity of the citizenship testing process is not compromised, Citizenship and Immigration Canada never discloses the copies of the tests, including the questions and answers.
7. I have reviewed the notes from the oral examination of the applicant's knowledge of Canada and the responsibilities and privileges of Canadian citizenship on her file and I can attest that Ms. Zhou correctly responded to 13 questions out of 20. As a result, she obtained a score of 13 out of 20 (65%) and failed the test. Specifically, Ms. Zhou failed to correctly answer questions 1, 2, 7, 11, 14, 16 and 18. I have further reviewed Ms. Zhou's answers and confirm that her answers to questions 1, 2, 7, 11, 14, 16 and 18 are incorrect.
[...]
[25]
Paragraphs 1 to 5 of the affidavit are factual and are matters of which Ms. Del Medico would have personal knowledge as a result of her stated position and the responsibilities that go along with that position. Those paragraphs attest to the compiling and certification of a true copy of the CTR and are admissible as is Exhibit "A". This includes the citizenship test which was originally identified as forming a part of, but redacted from, the CTR and which was subsequently provided as the Confidential CTR in accordance with the confidentiality order. As to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the affidavit and Exhibits "B" and "C", these attestations are evidentiary in nature and could be interpreted as intended to support the Respondent's position. Further, the exhibits do not comprise a part of the tribunal record. As such, I afford paragraphs 6 and 7 and Exhibits "B" and "C" no weight (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[26]
I now turn to the substance of the Decision. Simply put, there is no evidence on the record before me that the Citizenship Judge erred in his Decision or, more precisely, in his assessment of the Applicant's knowledge under subsection 5(1)(e) of the Act. Indeed, the record clearly confirms his conclusion.
[27]
In this regard, the Confidential CTR is comprised of the three pages which were redacted from the CTR, being a document entitled Canadian Citizenship Test - Oral Hearing, a standard document. In the Client Name section is entered by hand "Zhou Wei", in the File Number section is entered by hand 3981286, and, in the Date section is stamped Dec 28, 2011. Questions numbered one to twenty are set out. Under each question is listed the correct answer (or answers if more than one is acceptable). The test is annotated by hand to indicate which questions were answered correctly and which were answered incorrectly. Where a correct answer was given by the Applicant this is underlined by hand and a check mark placed by the question. Where an incorrect answer was given an "X" is placed by the question and the incorrect answer given by the Applicant is recorded by hand. Seven questions are marked as answered incorrectly and thirteen are marked as answered correctly. In one case the recorded answer is "I can't remember, I'm sorry" and in another it is "no answer". The test is signed by the Citizenship Judge.
[28]
The CTR also contains a copy of the Notice to the Minister of the Decision of the Citizenship Judge dated December 28, 2011. This was prepared and signed by the Citizenship Judge and confirms that all of the citizenship requirements, including residency, had been met by the Applicant with the exception of subsection 5(1)(e). In the reasons set out in that document the Citizenship Judge wrote that "The Applicant has not complied with paragraph 5(1)(e) (knowledge) as per attached assessment, correctly answered 13/20, 65% on "The Knowledge of Canada", when the minimum requirement is 15/20 - 75%."
[29]
Not having taken the opportunity to review the answers noted, the Applicant has offered no specific challenges to the Decision, other than her general claim to have answered all of the questions correctly. This is contradicted by the tribunal record. Based on that record, the Citizenship Judge's Decision was justifiable, transparent and intelligible and the only possible outcome.
[30]
At the hearing, the Applicant also submitted that it was unfair that she was required to have an interview before a citizenship judge and have a citizenship test given orally. She submits that because she was unavailable to write the test when it was originally scheduled that it should simply have been rescheduled. She claims that due to a clerical error of the Respondent, she was required to appear before the Citizenship Judge and that had it been otherwise she would have passed the test. The Applicant did not refer me to any regulation, policy or directive indicating that if an applicant cannot attend a scheduled written citizenship test then the applicant is entitled to a second scheduled written test rather than being directed to attend before a citizenship judge. In my view the Applicant's argument cannot succeed in the absence of a supporting legislative or other basis.
iii)
Bias
[31]
In her affidavit the Applicant states:
9. The Judge made me feel nervous right away by the tone of his voice.
10. He said to me 'Do you know you don't live in Canada for a long time, but you still take advantage of the benefits and welfare. It is not fair to Canadian.'
[...]
16. As I got up to leave after the interview the judge said to me
'I think you better tell your other friends if they don't live in Canada for the long term, do not apply for citizenship. It is not fair to Canadians.'
[...]
[32]
The Applicant submits that these comments meet the test for a reasonable apprehension of bias as set out in the dissenting opinion of Justice de Grandpré in
Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 394, being "what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly." The Applicant further submits that because this evidence has not been challenged or contradicted, the appeal must succeed.
[33]
The Respondent submits that it is presumed that administrative tribunals act fairly and without bias and that allegations of bias and misconduct are serious and should not be taken lightly. The Respondent further submits that the threshold for the finding of bias is very high and has not been met in this case (
Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Respondent points to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which the Court cautioned against unsubstantiated allegations of bias against the Court and public officials given the harm caused to the administration of justice. The Respondent notes that there are credibility concerns with the Applicant, as she asserted in her Affidavit that she answered all of the citizenship test questions correctly when the record shows that this is not true, and submits that her claims of bias lack credible basis.
[34]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Zinn canvassed the presumption that allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness:
[23] "[W]hen an applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 305 (C.A.). "The 'presumption' that a claimant's sworn testimony is true is always rebuttable, and, in appropriate circumstances, may be rebutted by the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention" [emphasis added]:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) (QL) at para. 1. [...]
[35]
In this case, the Applicant's affidavit evidence was not challenged by the Respondent by way of cross examination or by the filing of an affidavit by the Citizenship Judge denying the allegation of bias. However, there is reason to doubt the truthfulness of the allegations contained in the Applicant's affidavit. As is argued by the Respondent, the Applicant's claim to have answered all of the questions on the Citizenship exam correctly is not borne out by the record. Further, given that the record indicates she failed to answer two of the questions, she cannot reasonably claim to have mistakenly stated that she correctly answered every question nor does she make such a claim. Rather, she contends that the citizenship test is inadmissible, she has declined to review the test when it was made available by way of the confidentiality order and relies on her unchallenged affidavit as evidence that she did correctly answer all of the questions. This undermines the Applicant's credibility.
[36]
The Respondent also argues that the Applicant did not raise the issue of bias until after the Decision was rendered. However, I give less weight to this fact as it could reasonably be attributed to reluctance to risk alienating the decision-maker while a decision was outstanding and a positive outcome was anticipated.
[37]
Given the uncertainty attached to the Applicant's credibility, and the fact that her statements are the only evidence on record regarding bias, I find that the Applicant has failed to meet the high threshold for establishing a reasonable apprehension of bias.
Costs
[38]
As to costs, the Applicant refers to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There a decision of a citizenship judge was delayed, without reason, for fifteen months rather than being issued within sixty days as required by subsection 14(1) of the
Citizenship Act.
Costs were awarded because it was held that a failure to comply with a directory requirement should not be sanctioned. Here the delay was of approximately sixty days. While this is not condoned or sanctioned, in the circumstances of this case as a whole I am not prepared to award costs to the Applicant.
JUDGMENT
[39]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the appeal is dismissed and there shall be no order as to costs.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'un appel que Wei Zhou (la demanderesse) a interjeté, en vertu du paragraphe 14(5) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, LRC 1985, c C-29 (la Loi), à l'encontre de la décision d'un juge de la citoyenneté de rejeter sa demande de citoyenneté. Le rejet reposait sur le fait que la demanderesse n'avait pas obtenu la note de passage requise à l'examen pour la citoyenneté et, ainsi, n'avait pas démontré qu'elle avait une connaissance adéquate du Canada de même que des responsabilités et avantages conférés par la citoyenneté, comme l'exige l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) de la Loi. Le présent appel est interjeté conformément à l'article 18.1 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC 1985, c F-7 et à l'alinéa 300
c
) des
Règles des Cours fédérales,
DORS/98-106 (les Règles).
Le contexte
[2]
En 1999, la demanderesse est venue au Canada à titre d'étudiante. Elle est devenue résidente permanente le 17 octobre 2003 et, en 2010, elle a présenté une demande de citoyenneté qui a été reçue par le défendeur le 9 juillet 2010. Au moyen d'un avis daté du 14 septembre 2011, on avait enjoint à la demanderesse de passer un examen pour la citoyenneté le 29 septembre 2011. Elle a avisé le défendeur qu'elle ne pouvait se présenter à l'examen parce qu'elle serait à l'extérieur du Canada du 28 juin 2011 à mars 2012. Il lui a alors été demandé de comparaître, le 28 décembre 2011, à une audience devant un juge de la citoyenneté.
[3]
La demanderesse s'est présentée comme il lui avait été demandé et un examen pour la citoyenneté a été donné par le juge de la citoyenneté, George Khouri (le juge de la citoyenneté). Dans une lettre en date du 26 avril 2012, la demanderesse a été informée par le juge de la citoyenneté que sa demande n'avait pas été approuvée parce qu'elle n'avait pas démontré, dans ses réponses aux questions rédigées par le ministre, qu'elle possédait les connaissances requises suivant l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) de la Loi. Plus précisément, la demanderesse n'a répondu correctement qu'à 13 questions sur 20 et a obtenu une note de 65 %; ainsi, elle n'a pu obtenir la note de passage requise de 75 % (la décision).
[4]
La demanderesse a interjeté appel et, à l'appui de sa demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision, elle a déposé un affidavit dans lequel elle déclarait avoir répondu correctement à toutes les questions de l'examen et que le juge de la citoyenneté avait fait des déclarations pendant l'entrevue qui, a-t-elle soutenu dans sa demande, suscitaient une crainte raisonnable de partialité.
La décision contestée
[5]
Dans sa décision, le juge de la citoyenneté a informé la demanderesse qu'il lui avait fait connaître les motifs de sa décision conformément au paragraphe 14(3) de la Loi. Il a énoncé les exigences prévues par la loi qui concernaient sa demande ainsi que la décision et a expliqué que l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) exige qu'un demandeur ait une connaissance adéquate du Canada et des responsabilités et avantages conférés par la citoyenneté. En outre, le juge de la citoyenneté a signalé que, conformément au paragraphe 15(1) du
Règlement sur la citoyenneté
, DORS/93-246, une personne possède une connaissance suffisante du Canada si les réponses qu'elle donne aux questions rédigées par le ministre montrent qu'elle connaît les symboles nationaux du Canada et comprend d'une manière générale des sujets définis. De plus, conformément au paragraphe 15(2) du
Règlement sur la citoyenneté
, la personne doit, de même, posséder une connaissance suffisante des responsabilités et privilèges attachés à la citoyenneté.
[6]
Le juge de la citoyenneté a conclu ce qui suit:
[traduction]
Les questions de l'examen pour la citoyenneté qui portent sur la connaissance du Canada et des droits et responsabilités liés à la citoyenneté reposent sur les renseignements fournis dans le guide d'étude,
Découvrir le Canada: Les droits et responsabilités liés à la citoyenneté.
L'examen pour la citoyenneté comprend 20 questions et la note de passage est de 75 % (15 bonnes réponses sur 20 questions).
À l'audience, je vous ai posé des questions fondées sur celles rédigées par le ministre en vue de déterminer si vous satisfaisiez aux exigences de l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) de la Loi et vous avez répondu correctement à 13 questions sur 20, ce qui vous a valu une note de 65 %. Vous n'avez pu répondre correctement aux questions portant sur les sujets suivants:
• la procédure de vote et comment s'inscrire à une liste électorale;
• l'histoire du Canada;
• la géographie du Canada;
• les droits et responsabilités liés à la citoyenneté.
Pour ces raisons, vous ne satisfaites pas aux exigences de l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
en vue d'obtenir la citoyenneté canadienne.
[...]
Les questions en litige et la norme de contrôle applicable
[7]
La demanderesse soutient qu'il y a trois questions en litige et le défendeur en ajoute une quatrième:
(i) Le juge de la citoyenneté a-t-il commis une erreur de droit et a-t-il perdu la compétence nécessaire pour rejeter la demande de citoyenneté du fait qu'il n'a pas rendu sa décision dans un délai de 60 jours, ainsi que l'exige le paragraphe 14(1) de la Loi?
(ii) Le juge de la citoyenneté a-t-il commis une erreur en ne motivant pas suffisamment sa décision?
(iii) Le juge de la citoyenneté était-il partial?
(iv) Le juge de la citoyenneté a-t-il commis une erreur en concluant que la demanderesse n'avait pas obtenu la note de passage à l'examen pour la citoyenneté et, de ce fait, n'avait pas satisfait aux exigences de l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) de la Loi?
[8]
Compte tenu des indications de la Cour suprême du Canada dans
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> selon lesquelles les motifs invoqués pour justifier une décision doivent être appréciés en corrélation avec les résultats de cette décision, afin de statuer sur le caractère raisonnable de la décision dans son ensemble, l' « insuffisance » des motifs ne permet plus à elle seule de contester une décision. Ainsi, j'estime que les deuxième et quatrième questions en litige devraient être examinées ensemble et je reformulerais les questions ainsi:
(i) Le juge de la citoyenneté a-t-il commis une erreur de droit et a-t-il perdu la compétence nécessaire pour rejeter la demande de citoyenneté du fait qu'il n'a pas rendu sa décision dans un délai de 60 jours, ainsi que l'exige le paragraphe 14(1) de la Loi?
(ii) La conclusion du juge de la citoyenneté, à savoir que la demanderesse n'avait pas obtenu la note de passage à l'examen pour la citoyenneté et que, de ce fait, elle n'avait pas satisfait aux exigences de l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) de la Loi
,
était-elle raisonnable?
(iii) La demanderesse s'est-elle acquittée du fardeau d'établir qu'il y avait une crainte raisonnable de partialité de la part du juge de la citoyenneté?
[9]
La Cour suprême du Canada a statué qu'il n'était pas toujours nécessaire de se livrer à une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle. En effet, lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à la question précise en jeu est bien établie en jurisprudence, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
[10]
Il est bien établi que la conclusion d'un juge de la citoyenneté selon laquelle un demandeur a échoué à un examen pour la citoyenneté doit être contrôlée selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[11]
Lorsqu'une décision est contrôlée en fonction de la norme de la raisonnabilité, le caractère raisonnable tient « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, [ainsi qu'à] l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
[12]
Par contre, il n'est pas nécessaire de faire preuve d'une telle retenue à l'endroit d'un décideur administratif en ce qui concerne des questions relevant de l'équité procédurale ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 43;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Ainsi, la question de savoir si le juge de la citoyenneté était partial sera contrôlée selon la norme de la décision correcte.
[13]
Pour les motifs énoncés ci-dessous, la norme de contrôle applicable à la question de la compétence n'a pas à être examinée.
Analyse
i)
La perte de compétence
[14]
Dans ses observations écrites, la demanderesse soutient que le juge de la citoyenneté a perdu la compétence nécessaire pour se prononcer sur sa demande de citoyenneté parce qu'il n'a pas rendu sa décision dans un délai de 60 jours ainsi que l'exige le paragraphe 14(1) de la Loi. Cependant, à l'audience devant la Cour, la demanderesse a admis que c'était uniquement une question de dépens, et non une question de compétence ou d'équité procédurale.
ii)
Le caractère raisonnable de la décision du juge de la citoyenneté
[15]
Avant d'apprécier le caractère raisonnable de la décision, je présenterai d'abord ce qui fait partie à juste titre du dossier dont je suis saisie. À cette fin, il nous faut mettre en contexte une question de confidentialité et une décision sur la pertinence du contenu d'un affidavit produit en preuve.
[16]
D'abord, au regard de la question de la confidentialité, les questions auxquelles, selon le juge de la citoyenneté, la demanderesse avait mal répondu n'avaient pas été mentionnées dans ses motifs et, par ailleurs, le dossier certifié du tribunal (le DCT) ne comprenait pas l'examen pour la citoyenneté qui avait été donné. Le DCT a été remis aux parties et déposé auprès du greffe de la Cour fédérale, accompagné d'une lettre, datée du 10 juillet 2012, envoyée par Mme Anna Del Medico, conseillère en matière de citoyenneté, Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC). Dans cette lettre, Mme Del Medico a signalé, plus précisément, que les pages 06, 07 et 08 du dossier avaient été omises en entier, parce qu'elles contenaient des réponses de la demanderesse à l'examen pour la citoyenneté. Conformément au paragraphe 318(2) des Règles, CIC s'est opposé à la diffusion de cette information, au motif que sa divulgation pourrait compromettre l'intégrité de l'examen.
[17]
Selon l'article 317 des Règles, une partie peut demander la transmission des documents pertinents quant à la demande qui est en la possession de l'office fédéral dont la décision fait l'objet de la demande. Cela peut se faire dans le cadre de son avis de demande comme ce fut le cas en l'espèce. Selon le paragraphe 318(2) des Règles, si l'office fédéral s'oppose à la demande prévue à l'article 317, il informe par écrit toutes les parties des motifs de son opposition.
[18]
Bien que CIC se soit opposé à la divulgation de l'examen pour la citoyenneté au moment où le DCT a été produit, le 7 septembre 2012, le défendeur a présenté une requête visant à obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialité au regard de l'examen pour la citoyenneté. Les avocats et les parties pourraient ainsi déposer une copie mise sous scellés et confidentielle de l'examen et revoir l'examen, conformément aux conditions de l'ordonnance de confidentialité. La demanderesse s'est opposée à cette requête.
[19]
Au moyen d'une ordonnance en date du 2 octobre 2012, la protonotaire Milczynski a indiqué qu'elle était convaincue qu'il était dans l'intérêt public de maintenir la confidentialité de l'information visée par la demande de mise sous scellés de manière à assurer l'intégrité du processus d'examen pour la citoyenneté. Elle a ordonné à CIC de déposer les pages non incluses dans le DCT initial (l'examen pour la citoyenneté) auprès de la Cour pour qu'elles soient mises sous scellés et considérées comme confidentielles en vertu de l'article 152 des Règles. Après le dépôt des engagements écrits des avocats conformément à l'alinéa 152(2)
b
) des Règles, les avocats inscrits au dossier et les parties seraient autorisés à avoir accès aux pages mises sous scellés, appelées l'élément matériel confidentiel du DCT.
[20]
L'examen pour la citoyenneté confidentiel a été dûment déposé auprès de la Cour le 5 octobre 2012, et l'avocat du défendeur a ensuite déposé l'engagement écrit demandé. L'avocat de la demanderesse n'a pas déposé d'engagement. Au moment de l'audience devant la Cour, ni l'avocat de la demanderesse ni cette dernière n'avaient analysé l'examen sur la citoyenneté en question.
[21]
La demanderesse soutient qu'elle n'est pas d'accord avec l'ordonnance de la protonotaire, à savoir qu'il est dans l'intérêt public de maintenir la confidentialité des questions de l'examen pour la citoyenneté et affirme qu'aucune autorisation ou directive n'a été donnée en ce sens par le ministre. Cependant, je suis saisie de l'appel de la décision du juge de la citoyenneté, non d'un appel de l'ordonnance de la protonotaire, à laquelle je souscris de toute façon.
[22]
Le 13 septembre 2012, la demanderesse a présenté une requête pour contester un affidavit de Mme Del Medico, daté du 15 août 2012. Cet affidavit a été versé au dossier du défendeur. La lettre de Mme Del Medico, datée du 10 juillet 2012, accompagnant le DCT donné aux parties, a été annexée comme pièce A. La demanderesse a demandé que les paragraphes 3, 4, 5, 6 et 7 de l'affidavit soient radiés conformément à l'article 81 des Règles, parce qu'elle alléguait que la déposante ne connaissait pas personnellement les faits présentés dans ces paragraphes. Dans une ordonnance datée du 2 octobre 2012, la protonotaire Milczynski a rejeté la requête, au motif que la question devrait être examinée par le juge entendant l'appel sur le fond.
[23]
Devant la Cour, la demanderesse a affirmé que l'affidavit n'était pas admissible, parce qu'il visait à étayer le dossier et les motifs du juge de la citoyenneté. En outre, elle fait valoir que, parce que le DCT, y compris l'examen pour la citoyenneté, sont des pièces annexées à l'affidavit, ils ne sont pas non plus admissibles et ne doivent pas faire partie du dossier qui peut être examiné par la Cour dans le présent appel. En bref, la demanderesse soutient qu'il n'existe pas d'éléments de preuve admissibles quant au résultat de l'examen pour la citoyenneté autre que l'affidavit non contesté de la demanderesse indiquant qu'elle a répondu correctement à toutes les questions de l'examen.
[24]
L'affidavit est ainsi libellé:
[traduction]
Je, Anna Del Medico, agente de citoyenneté, Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada, bureau de Scarborough, DÉCLARE SOUS SERMENT QUE:
1. Je travaille pour le gouvernement du Canada au bureau local de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC), à Scarborough. Je suis agente de citoyenneté et chargée de répondre aux demandes de documents en la possession de notre bureau. À ce titre, j'ai connaissance des faits énoncés ci-après.
2. La demanderesse interjette appel de la décision du juge de la citoyenneté, George Khouri. Sur son avis de demande, le bureau de citoyenneté de Scarborough, situé au 200, Town Centre Court, bureau 370, Scarborough (Ontario) M1P 4X8, est prié d'envoyer aux parties et au greffe de la Cour fédérale une copie certifiée du dossier complet du juge de l'immigration relatif à la demande de citoyenneté de la demanderesse.
3. En tant qu'agente de citoyenneté, il est de ma responsabilité de préparer les copies conformes des documents demandés par la demanderesse. J'ai examiné le dossier de la citoyenneté et préparé une copie conforme de ce dossier. J'ai envoyé la lettre, datée du 10 juillet 2012 et adressée au greffe de la Cour fédérale du Canada, qui certifie le dossier. J'ai également envoyé la copie certifiée conforme du dossier, ainsi que la lettre, aux parties et à la Cour.
4. Une copie conforme du dossier certifié du tribunal précédemment envoyée aux parties et à la Cour est annexée comme pièce A.
5. Quand j'ai rassemblé les documents du dossier certifié du tribunal et les ai déposés au greffe de la Cour fédérale le 7 juillet 2012, j'ai dressé la liste des questions utilisées et annotées par le juge de la citoyenneté, George Khouri, dans l'évaluation de la connaissance qu'a la demanderesse du Canada conformément au paragraphe 318(2) des
Règles de[s] Cour[s] fédérale[s
].
6. Afin d'assurer un traitement équitable à tous les demandeurs et de veiller à ce que l'intégrité du processus d'examen pour la citoyenneté ne soit pas compromise, Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada ne transmet jamais les copies des examens, y compris les questions et les réponses.
7. J'ai examiné les notes de l'examen oral portant sur la connaissance qu'a la demanderesse du Canada ainsi que des responsabilités et avantages conférés par la citoyenneté canadienne figurant à son dossier et je peux attester que Mme Zhou a répondu correctement à 13 questions sur 20. En conséquence, elle a obtenu une note de 13 sur 20 (65 %) et n'a pas réussi l'examen. Plus précisément, Mme Zhou n'a pas répondu correctement aux questions 1, 2, 7, 11, 14, 16 et 18. J'ai revu attentivement les réponses de Mme Zhou et je confirme que ses réponses aux questions 1, 2, 7, 11, 14, 16 et 18 sont inexactes.
[...]
[25]
Les paragraphes 1 à 5 de l'affidavit énoncent des faits dont Mme Del Medico aurait une connaissance personnelle en raison de ses fonctions officielles et des responsabilités qui vont de pair avec celles-ci. Ces paragraphes attestent la compilation des documents et la certification d'une copie conforme du DCT et sont admis comme pièce A. Cela comprend l'examen pour la citoyenneté qui a été au départ établi comme faisant partie du DCT, mais retranché de ce dernier, et qui a ensuite été présenté comme le DCT confidentiel, conformément à l'ordonnance de confidentialité. Quant aux paragraphes 6 et 7 de l'affidavit et aux pièces B et C, ces attestations constituent des éléments de preuve et pourraient être interprétées comme visant à soutenir la position du défendeur. En outre, les pièces ne font pas partie du dossier du tribunal. Ainsi, je n'accorde aucun poids aux paragraphes 6 et 7 ainsi qu'aux pièces B et C (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 47;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 18.
[26]
J'aborde maintenant le fond de la décision. En résumé, aucun élément de preuve versé au dossier dont je suis saisie ne permet de croire que le juge de la citoyenneté a commis une erreur dans sa décision ou, plus précisément, dans son évaluation des connaissances de la demanderesse au titre de l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) de la Loi. En effet, le dossier confirme clairement sa conclusion.
[27]
À cet égard, le DCT confidentiel est composé de trois pages qui ont été retranchées du DCT, soit un document normalisé intitulé [traduction] « Examen de la citoyenneté canadienne - Oral ». Dans la section [traduction] « Nom du client » figure le nom « Zhou Wei » qui a été inscrit à la main, dans la section [traduction] « Numéro de dossier », figure le chiffre « 3981286 » qui a été inscrit à la main et, dans la section [traduction] « Date », est estampillée la date du 28 décembre 2011. Les questions formulées sont numérotées de un à vingt. Sous chaque question est indiquée la bonne réponse (ou des réponses si plus d'une réponse est acceptable). L'examen est annoté à la main pour indiquer quelles questions ont obtenu une bonne réponse et celles dont la réponse est erronée. Lorsque la demanderesse a donné une bonne réponse, cela est souligné à la main et la question est cochée. Lorsqu'elle a donné une mauvaise réponse, un « X » figure près de la question et la réponse erronée donnée par la demanderesse est inscrite à la main. Dans le cas de sept questions, il est mentionné que la réponse est erronée et, pour ce qui est de treize questions, il est mentionné que la réponse est exacte. Dans un cas, la réponse inscrite est [traduction] « Je ne me souviens pas, je suis désolée » et dans l'autre, [traduction] « pas de réponse ». L'examen est signé par le juge de la citoyenneté.
[28]
Le DCT contient aussi une copie de l'Avis au ministre de la décision du juge de la citoyenneté, datée du 28 décembre 2011. Cet avis a été préparé et signé par le juge de la citoyenneté et confirme que la demanderesse a satisfait à toutes les exigences en matière de citoyenneté, y compris la résidence, à l'exception de celles de l'alinéa 5(1)
e
). Dans les motifs énoncés dans ce document, le juge de la citoyenneté a écrit que [traduction] « [l] a demanderesse ne s'est pas conformée à l'alinéa 5(1)
e
) (la connaissance); selon l'évaluation jointe, elle a répondu correctement à 13 questions sur 20 (65 %) portant sur [traduction] « La connaissance du Canada », l'exigence minimale étant de 15 questions sur 20 ( 75 %) ».
[29]
N'ayant pas eu la possibilité d'analyser les réponses inscrites, la demanderesse n'a soulevé aucune contestation particulière à l'égard de la décision, autre que le fait d'alléguer de manière générale qu'elle avait répondu à toutes les questions correctement. Le dossier du tribunal contredit cette allégation. D'après ce dossier, la décision du juge de la citoyenneté était justifiée, transparente et intelligible, et la seule issue possible.
[30]
À l'audience, la demanderesse a également fait valoir qu'il était injuste qu'elle ait dû avoir une entrevue devant un juge de la citoyenneté et passer un examen oral pour la citoyenneté. Elle soutient que, parce qu'elle n'était pas disponible pour passer l'examen écrit au moment où il était prévu initialement, celui-ci aurait dû simplement être reporté. Elle affirme qu'en raison d'une erreur d'écriture de la part du défendeur, elle a dû comparaître devant le juge de la citoyenneté et que, s'il en avait été autrement, elle aurait réussi l'examen. La demanderesse n'a cité aucune réglementation, politique ou directive indiquant que, si un demandeur ne peut se présenter à un examen écrit prévu pour la citoyenneté, alors, ce dernier a le droit de passer un deuxième examen écrit au lieu d'être obligé de comparaître devant un juge de la citoyenneté. À mon avis, l'argument de la demanderesse ne peut être retenu s'il n'est étayé par aucune disposition législative ou un autre fondement juridique.
iii)
La partialité
[31]
Dans son affidavit, la demanderesse affirme ce qui suit:
[traduction]
9. Le juge, par le ton de sa voix, m'a d'emblée rendue nerveuse.
10. Il m'a dit: [traduction] « Savez-vous, ne pas vivre au Canada pendant longtemps, mais profiter tout de même des prestations et du bien-être social, ce n'est pas juste pour les Canadiens. »
[...]
16. Comme je m'apprêtais à partir après l'entrevue, le juge m'a dit:
[traduction]
« Je pense que vous feriez mieux de dire à vos autres amis que, s'ils ne demeurent pas au Canada à long terme, ils ne doivent pas demander la citoyenneté. Ce n'est pas juste pour les Canadiens. »
[...]
[32]
La demanderesse soutient que ces commentaires répondent au critère d'une crainte raisonnable de partialité ainsi qu'il ressort de l'opinion dissidente du juge de Grandpré dans
Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 394: « Il faut plutôt se demander à quelle conclusion en arriverait une personne bien renseignée qui étudierait la question en profondeur, de façon réaliste et pratique. Croirait-elle que, selon toute vraisemblance, [le décideur], consciemment ou non, ne rendra pas une décision juste? » La demanderesse soutient en outre que, parce que cet élément de preuve n'a pas été contesté ou contredit, l'appel doit être accueilli.
[33]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il est présumé que les tribunaux administratifs agissent de manière équitable et sans parti pris et que les allégations de partialité et d'inconduite sont graves et ne doivent pas être prises à la légère. Il soutient en outre que le seuil est très élevé pour pouvoir conclure à la partialité et que ce seuil n'a pas été atteint en l'espèce (
Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le défendeur attire l'attention sur l'arrêt de la Cour d'appel fédérale dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans laquelle la Cour d'appel a mis en garde contre des allégations non fondées de partialité contre la présente cour et les fonctionnaires, compte tenu du préjudice causé à l'administration de la justice. Il fait remarquer que la crédibilité de la demanderesse pose problème, parce qu'elle a affirmé dans son affidavit avoir répondu correctement à toutes les questions de l'examen pour la citoyenneté, alors que le dossier indique le contraire, et il affirme que ses allégations de partialité manquent de crédibilité.
[34]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Zinn a traité de la question relative à la présomption voulant que les allégations soient véridiques, sauf s'il y a des raisons de douter de leur véracité:
[23] « Quand un requérant jure que certaines allégations sont vraies, cela crée une présomption qu'elles le sont, à moins qu'il n'existe des raisons d'en douter »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à 305 (C.A.). « La "présomption" selon laquelle le témoignage sous serment d'un requérant est véridique peut toujours être réfutée et,
dans les circonstances appropriées
, peut l'être par l'absence de preuves documentaires mentionnant un fait qu'on pourrait normalement s'attendre à y retrouver » [non souligné dans l'original]:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.) (QL), paragraphe 1 ». [...]
[35]
En l'espèce, la preuve par affidavit de la demanderesse n'a pas été contestée par le défendeur dans le cadre d'un contre-interrogatoire ou par le dépôt d'un affidavit par le juge de la citoyenneté qui nie l'allégation de partialité. Cependant, il y a lieu de douter de la véracité des allégations contenues dans l'affidavit de la demanderesse. Ainsi qu'il est soutenu par le défendeur, l'allégation de la demanderesse selon laquelle elle aurait répondu correctement à toutes les questions de l'examen pour la citoyenneté n'est pas confirmée par le dossier. En outre, étant donné que le dossier indique qu'elle n'a pas réussi à répondre à deux questions, elle ne peut raisonnablement prétendre avoir déclaré par inadvertance qu'elle avait répondu correctement à toutes les questions et ne fait pas une telle allégation. Elle soutient plutôt que l'examen pour la citoyenneté est inadmissible, a refusé de réexaminer l'examen au moment où l'ordonnance de confidentialité le lui permettait et s'appuie sur son affidavit non contesté pour démontrer qu'elle a répondu correctement à toutes les questions. Cela mine la crédibilité de la demanderesse.
[36]
Le défendeur fait également valoir que la demanderesse n'a soulevé la question de la partialité qu'une fois la décision rendue. Cependant, j'accorde moins d'importance à ce fait parce qu'il pourrait raisonnablement être attribué à la réticence à s'aliéner le décideur quand la décision était toujours en suspens et qu'un résultat positif était prévu.
[37]
Vu l'incertitude liée à la crédibilité de la demanderesse et du fait que ses déclarations sont le seul élément de preuve au dossier en ce qui concerne la partialité, je conclus que la demanderesse ne s'est pas acquittée du fardeau élevé qui lui incombait pour établir une crainte raisonnable de partialité.
Les dépens
[38]
En ce qui concerne les dépens, la demanderesse se réfère à
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans cette affaire, une décision d'un juge de la citoyenneté a été retardée, sans raison, pendant quinze mois, plutôt que d'être rendue dans un délai de soixante jours comme l'exige le paragraphe 14(1) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
. Des dépens ont été attribués, parce qu'il n'y avait pas lieu de sanctionner le défaut de se conformer à une disposition à caractère directif. En l'espèce, le délai est d'environ 60 jours. Bien que ce ne soit ni toléré ni sanctionné, dans les circonstances de l'espèce dans son ensemble, je ne suis pas disposée à accorder des dépens à la demanderesse.
JUGEMENT
[39]
LA COUR STATUE que
l'appel est rejeté et qu'aucune ordonnance ne sera rendue quant aux dépens.
