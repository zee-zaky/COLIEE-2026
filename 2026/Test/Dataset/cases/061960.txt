[1]
O'Keefe, J.
: The applicant was refused Canada's protection by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board). He now seeks judicial review from this Court pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act].
[2]
The applicant asks for an order setting aside the Board's decision and returning the matter to another panel of the Board.
I. Background
[3]
Weili Zeng (the applicant) is a Chinese citizen. He arrived in Canada on February 27, 2012 and asked for refugee protection within a month. He claims that he fears persecution for practicing Falun Gong ever since his practice group was raided by the Public Security Bureau (PSB).
II. Decision Under Review
[4]
The Board refused the application on February 20, 2013.
[5]
Essentially, the Board decided that the applicant lied about the events leading to his departure from China. It gave thirteen reasons for doubting the applicant's story:
i. The applicant said in his personal information form (PIF) that he was introduced to Falun Gong by his friend, Tang, in August 2010 and began practicing immediately. He later testified that he was introduced to it in June 2010, but only started practicing in August.
ii. Despite being asked for them, the applicant did not submit any transcripts to prove that practicing Falun Gong improved his grades.
iii. The applicant said that the group practices always happened between 8:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Yet, the applicant testified that the lookout would be outside sewing. When the member observed that it would be too dark during the winter, the applicant said she would sit near convenience stores. The Board was suspicious that the applicant did not mention the convenience stores at first. As well, the Board thought a lookout would not linger for so long for fear of drawing suspicion.
iv. After the alleged raid, the applicant said he lived with his 18 year old friend for three months to hide from the PSB. He testified that his friend's parents lived two to three hours away, but never once came home to check on their son or their property. The Board considered this implausible.
v. In his PIF, the applicant mentioned that his instructor and some other members of his group were arrested. However, he only mentioned that his friend Tang was among them at the hearing. The Board figured that the applicant would have mentioned Tang by name in his PIF because of his role in introducing the applicant to Falun Gong.
vi. Despite being asked for them, the applicant did not produce jail visiting cards that he could have obtained from Tang's mother.
vii. The applicant testified that his parents kept his copy of Zhuan Falun for him, but the Board considered it more likely that they would destroy it.
viii. The applicant said the PSB never left a summons with his family on any of the seven occasions they visited his house. Although that is technically proper procedure, the Board found that it happens all the time that the police leave a summons with a family member and inferred from its absence that the PSB had no interest in the applicant.
ix. The applicant received a passport one month before the alleged raid, which the Board thought was too coincidental.
x. The applicant left China with that genuine passport. The Board found that this could not have happened since these documents would have needed to be shown when travelling through Hong Kong. Further, if the smuggler had bribed anyone, he would have told the applicant.
xi. The applicant could not have left on a genuine passport if he was wanted by the PSB because China has a national computer network that would have flagged him.
xii. The applicant was in the United States for nine days but did not claim asylum.
xiii. The applicant did not prove that his family was punished, even though the families of Falun Gong practitioners often are.
[6]
The Board accepted that the applicant did practice Falun Gong in Canada and so answered most basic questions about it correctly. However, because the Board did not believe that the applicant practiced Falun Gong in China, it concluded that the applicant only started doing it here to bolster a fraudulent refugee claim.
[7]
Consequently, the Board decided that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection under section 97.
III. Issues
[8]
This application raises two issues:
1. What is the standard of review?
2. Did the Board err in assessing the applicant's credibility?
A.
Applicant's Written Submissions
[9]
The applicant accuses the Board of conducting a microscopic assessment of the claim. Specifically, he criticizes the Board for seizing on two minor details to make negative credibility findings which were: (1) the minor discrepancy in the month he started practicing Falun Gong; and (2) the omission of Tang's arrest from the PIF.
[10]
Further, he points out that plausibility findings should be made only when it is clear that the events could not have happened as described (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2007] FCJ No 397 [
Xu
]). In his view, at least three of the events he described were not inherently improbable: (1) his friend's parents did not come home for three months; (2) his parents did not destroy his copy of Zhuan Falun; and (3) he obtained a passport one month before the raid.
[11]
Similarly, the applicant says that he was able to leave with his own passport because he hired a smuggler. There is nothing implausible about that.
[12]
As for the summonses, the documentary evidence clearly said that "there can be substantial regional variances in law enforcement". It may be common that summonses are left with families, but that is not the way it always happens. The applicant says the Board relied on this evidence rather selectively and that the Federal Court has often found similar findings unreasonable.
[13]
Finally, the applicant admits that the documentary evidence said that family members could be punished in a variety of ways, including "harassment by the police (random visit by police to the home), arbitrary interrogation, losing [a] job, losing [the] chance of promotion, losing [a] pension/state housing, etc." However, it did not say that all of those events necessarily happen to every family. Here, he testified that his family had been visited seven times and so has been harassed and arbitrarily interrogated.
IV.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[14]
The respondent recites the Board's credibility findings and says that it was not conducted microscopically. Rather, the Board reasonably weighed the evidence and drew reasonable inferences that it was entitled to make based on implausibilities and common sense.
[15]
Further, the respondent says that the Federal Court has confirmed that a Board can reasonably consider the absence of a summons document when an applicant alleges that his or her family has been visited by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 108 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Given the credibility concerns, it was reasonable to require corroborating evidence.
[16]
Finally, the respondent admits that the applicant had testified that his family was harassed. However, that was but one credibility finding of many and it should not disturb the general finding that he was lying.
V. Analysis and Decision
A.
Issue 1 - What is the standard of review?
[17]
The Board's credibility findings should be reviewed on the reasonableness standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) at paragraph 4, 160 NR 315 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). The Board's decision should not be disturbed so long as it is justifiable, transparent, intelligible and its outcome is defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47). Put another way, I will set aside the Board's decision only if I cannot understand why it reached its conclusions or how the facts and applicable law support the outcome (see
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[18]
As the Board itself observed, the starting point for assessing credibility is that the applicant is presumed to tell the truth (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
B.
Issue 2 - Did the Board err in assessing the applicant's credibility?
[19]
Although some elements of the Board's decision were problematic, I ultimately agree with the respondent that the decision was reasonable.
[20]
With respect to plausibility findings, it is true that they should only endanger a claimant's credibility when it is clear that the events could not have happened as the claimant described (
Xu
at paragraph 17). However, it must be recalled that the Board is still better placed than this Court to make them. As the Court of Appeal said in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 4:
There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences?
As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review
.
[Emphasis added]
[21]
Given that, I must disagree with the applicant that most of the Board's findings warrant this Court's intervention. With respect to the absence of his friend's parents, the Board explained that they were only two to three hours away by car. It found it implausible that they would not once check on their son or their property in a three month period. It also considered it strange that the applicant would never ask his friend whether they might come home. That seems to me a reasonable inference.
[22]
However, some of the applicant's other arguments do reveal some problems.
[23]
First, the Board found that it was implausible that his parents would merely hide the applicant's copy of Zhuan Falun instead of destroying it. Although I agree with the Board that it seems unlikely, all the applicant said was that he asked his parents to hide it. He did not say that they actually did. Even if the parents destroyed it, it is plausible that they could have done so without telling the applicant.
[24]
With respect to the summonses, the applicant points out that the documentary evidence is conflicting. Although one source said that "a summons would almost always be issued to the individual", another said that police authorities leave summonses with family members "all the time, especially in cases when the person on the summons is not easily locatable" (see Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, RIR CHN42444.E,
China: Circumstances and authorities responsible for issuing summonses/subpoenas
(1 June 2004) at 3). This is partly because "there can be substantial regional variances in law enforcement".
[25]
Nevertheless, the Board found it implausible that the PSB would visit the applicant's family seven times and never leave a summons.
[26]
There appears to be conflicting jurisprudence from this Court as to whether this is reasonable. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 35, Mr. Justice David Near observed that "[w]hile the documentary evidence suggested that the PSB's practice with respect to leaving a summons is not uniform, it does not directly contradict the Board's finding." As such, the applicant had only shown that a different finding could have been made, not that the finding that was made was unreasonable.
[27]
However, other decisions of the Court have held that similar inferences were unreasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 532, a claimant had said that the PSB had visited him ten times and never left a summons. The Board found that this was implausible. However, Mr. Justice Donald Rennie held that was an error, saying at paragraph 17 that "the applicant's testimony was clearly within the realm of possibility and was reconcilable with the country condition evidence before it regarding uneven practices on the part of the PSB." Similar findings were made by Mr. Justice James O'Reilly in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 162 and by Mr. Justice Michel Shore in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 74 [
Liang
].
[28]
With respect, I believe the latter view better accords with this Court's jurisprudence on plausibility findings. As Justice Shore explained in
Liang
at paragraph 14, "if the norm in the Applicant's region is for the PSB not to leave a summons/warrant for anyone other than the person who is named, then presumably that norm is followed regardless of how many times the PSB visits ...". Therefore, if this were the only basis for the Board's decision, it would have been unreasonable for the Board to have rejected the applicant's credibility for having the misfortune to live in a region where he was persecuted by the correct procedure.
[29]
As well, the respondent rightly concedes that the Board's finding regarding the punishment of family members was problematic. The documentary evidence upon which the Board relied does not say that every bad thing there listed happened to every single family of a Falun Gong practitioner. Further, the applicant testified that his family was, in fact, being harassed. An implausibility finding on that subject was unreasonable.
[30]
Despite those errors, however, the Board's other observations withstand scrutiny and justify the negative credibility findings.
[31]
For one thing, the applicant does not challenge many of the Board's credibility inferences, including those regarding the missing transcripts and jail visiting cards, as well as those regarding the lookout.
[32]
For another, the Board never ignored that the applicant said he was assisted by a smuggler. It simply found that it was unlikely that he could have left China on his own passport even with that assistance. Its explanation for this was reasonable.
[33]
The applicant also claims that the Board's findings with respect to the applicant's friend, Tang, were microscopic (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC(AD))). However, pointing out inconsistencies on minor details is not in itself problematic. Rather, as Madam Justice Judith Snider explained in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Admin LR (5th) 27, "a microscopic analysis is one in which the Board examines a fact which has no material relevance to any issue; is outweighed by other evidence; and, is not central to the issues in the case, but is used to dispose of the case."
[34]
In this case, the two statements about which the applicant complains were not used to dispose of the case. Rather, they were simply two elements used to corroborate a general finding that the applicant lacks credibility. In such a context, there is nothing unreasonable about observing that the applicant's PIF omitted or misrepresented details of his story.
[35]
Further, neither of the Board's observations were themselves unreasonable. In his PIF, the applicant had said that his friend, Tang, told him about Falun Gong "
[o] ne day
in August, 2010" (emphasis added) and that he agreed to try it immediately. By the time the hearing came around, he said that Tang told him about Falun Gong two months before he tried it. While it is not a particularly important detail, the Board cannot be faulted for observing that it is an inconsistency.
[36]
Similarly, it is strange that the applicant would not mention that Tang was among those arrested when filling out his PIF, considering the close relationship he allegedly had with him. The Board did not act unreasonably by pointing that out.
[37]
The Board also found that it was "too co-incidental" that the applicant applied for a passport just one month before the alleged raid. Although I agree with the applicant that that is not implausible, it is suspicious. In light of all the other evidence that the applicant had fabricated his story, it was no error to point out that this too corroborates that finding.
[38]
Therefore, although I agree that some of the Board's rationales were problematic, most of its findings remain unscathed. Given that, I still understand why the Board found that the applicant lacks credibility. The decision that he did not genuinely practice Falun Gong was therefore reasonable.
[39]
I would therefore dismiss the application for judicial review.
[40]
Neither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.
JUDGMENT
[41]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed.
ANNEX

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur a présenté une demande d'asile qui a été rejetée par la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission). Le demandeur sollicite maintenant auprès de la Cour le contrôle judiciaire de cette décision en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi).
[2]
Le demandeur sollicite une ordonnance annulant la décision défavorable et renvoyant l'affaire à un autre tribunal de la Commission.
I.
Contexte
[3]
Weili Zeng (le demandeur) est citoyen chinois. Il est arrivé au Canada le 27 février 2012 et a demandé l'asile dans le mois qui a suivi. Adepte du Falun Gong, il prétend craindre d'être persécuté depuis que son groupe a fait l'objet d'une descente par le Bureau de la sécurité publique (BSP).
II.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[4]
La Commission a rejeté la demande le 20 février 2013.
[5]
Essentiellement, la Commission a déterminé que le demandeur avait menti au sujet des événements qui l'ont mené à fuir la Chine. Voici les treize motifs suivants qui l'ont conduit à mettre en doute le récit du demandeur:
i. Il a indiqué dans son formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) qu'il avait été initié au Falun Gong par son ami Tang en août 2010 et qu'il s'était mis à pratiquer le Falun Gong immédiatement. Il a plus tard témoigné qu'il avait plutôt été initié à cette discipline en juin 2010 et qu'il avait commencé à la pratiquer seulement en août 2010.
ii. Malgré une demande à cet effet, le demandeur n'en a jamais fourni de relevés de notes en vue d'établir que la pratique du Falon Gong lui avait permis d'améliorer ses résultats.
iii. Le demandeur a affirmé que le groupe se réunissait toujours de 20 h à 21 h 30 pour pratiquer et que le guet était assuré par une femme qui tricotait à l'extérieur. À l'hiver, elle s'assoyait près des petits magasins en raison de la noirceur. La Commission a trouvé curieux que le demandeur n'ait pas mentionné les petits magasins dès le départ. De plus, elle a estimé qu'une personne faisant le guet ne resterait pas si longtemps sur place de peur d'attirer l'attention.
iv. Le demandeur a affirmé qu'après la descente alléguée, il a habité trois mois chez son ami, âgé de 18 ans, pour se cacher du BSP. Il a déclaré que les parents de son ami habitaient à une distance de deux à trois heures de route de chez lui, et qu'ils ne sont jamais venus prendre des nouvelles de leur fils ou vérifier l'état de leur propriété. Le Commission a estimé ce scénario peu probable.
v. Dans son FRP, le demandeur a indiqué que son instructeur et d'autres membres de son groupe avaient été arrêtés. Cependant, il a mentionné que son ami Tang était du lot seulement à l'audience. La Commission s'est dite d'avis que le demandeur aurait désigné Tang par son nom dans le formulaire étant donné que c'est lui qui l'a initié au Falun Gong.
vi. Bien qu'on lui ait demandé de le faire, le demandeur n'a jamais produit de documents de visite de prison, et ce, alors qu'il aurait pu en obtenir de la mère de Tang.
vii. Le demandeur a déclaré que ses parents gardaient son exemplaire du livre Zhuan Falun, mais la Commission a jugé plus probable qu'ils auraient détruit l'ouvrage.
viii. Le demandeur a dit que le BSP n'a pas laissé d'assignation à comparaître auprès de sa famille lors de ses sept visites à leur domicile. Bien qu'il s'agisse ici de la bonne façon de faire, la Commission a relevé qu'il est pratique courante que la police laisse une assignation à comparaître auprès d'un membre de la famille et a conclu du fait qu'aucune assignation n'avait été remise que le BSP ne s'intéressait pas au demandeur.
ix. Le demandeur a reçu un passeport un mois avant la descente alléguée, ce que la Commission a jugé comme étant plus qu'une coïncidence.
x. Le demandeur a quitté la Chine avec ce passeport valide. La Commission estime que cela est impossible parce que dans ce cas le demandeur aurait dû le présenter aux autorités lorsqu'il est passé par Hong Kong. De plus, si le passeur avait eu à soudoyer quelqu'un, il en aurait informé le demandeur.
xi. Le demandeur n'a pas pu quitter la Chine avec un véritable passeport s'il était recherché par le BSP, car il aurait été repéré grâce au réseau informatique national chinois.
xii. Le demandeur a transité par les États-Unis pendant neuf jours sans demander l'asile.
xiii. Le demandeur n'a fourni aucun élément de preuve selon lequel sa famille avait subi des représailles, bien que ce soit souvent le cas de la famille des adeptes du Falun Gong.
[6]
La Commission a reconnu que le demandeur pratiquait le Falun Gong au Canada et qu'il avait ainsi pu répondre correctement à des questions de base au sujet de la discipline. Cependant, la Commission a conclu que le demandeur ne pratiquait pas le Falun Gong en Chine et qu'il avait commencé à le faire au Canada uniquement pour renforcer une demande d'asile frauduleuse.
[7]
Ainsi, la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention, aux termes de l'article 96 de la Loi, ni celle de personne à protéger, au sens de l'article 97.
III.
Questions
[8]
La présente demande soulève deux questions:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son appréciation de la crédibilité du demandeur?
A.
Observations écrites du demandeur
[9]
Le demandeur reproche à la Commission d'avoir réalisé une analyse microscopique de sa demande. Plus précisément, il reproche à la Commission d'avoir tenu compte de deux détails mineurs pour tirer des conclusions défavorables quant à sa crédibilité: (1) la contradiction mineure au sujet du mois où il a commencé à pratiquer le Falun Gong et (2) le fait qu'il n'ait pas précisé dans son FRP que Tang avait été arrêté.
[10]
De plus, il fait remarquer que des conclusions en matière de crédibilité ne devraient être tirées que s'il est manifeste que les circonstances en l'espèce n'auraient pas pu se produire telles qu'elles ont été décrites (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2007] ACF no 397 [
Xu
]). Selon lui, trois des faits qu'il a rapportés n'étaient pas en soi improbables: (1) les parents de son ami ne sont pas rentrés à la maison pendant trois mois; (2) ses parents n'ont pas détruit son exemplaire du livre Zhuan Falun; et (3) il a obtenu son passeport un mois avant la descente.
[11]
Le demandeur a également soutenu qu'il avait pu quitter la Chine avec son propre passeport parce qu'il avait eu recours à un passeur. Cela n'a rien d'invraisemblable.
[12]
En ce qui concerne les assignations à comparaître, la preuve documentaire montre que « l'application de la loi peut varier considérablement en fonction des régions ». Il est possible qu'il soit fréquent que les assignations à comparaître soient remises aux membres de la famille, mais ce n'est pas une pratique systématique. Le demandeur fait valoir que la Commission s'est par le passé fondée sur la preuve à cet égard de façon plutôt sélective et que la Cour fédérale a à de nombreuses reprises conclu que ce type de conclusions était déraisonnable.
[13]
Enfin, le demandeur a concédé que la preuve documentaire indique que des membres de la famille de la personne pouvaient subir diverses représailles, notamment sous forme de « harcèlement de la part de la police (visites inattendues de la police), interrogatoires arbitraires, perte [d'un] emploi, évanouissement de [l'] espoir d'une promotion, perte [de la] pension ou d'un logement de l'État, etc. ». Cependant, elle n'indique pas que toutes les familles sont exposées à tous ses châtiments. En l'espèce, il fait valoir que sa famille avait été visitée sept fois et qu'elle avait à ce titre été victime de harcèlement et d'interrogatoires arbitraires.
IV.
Observations écrites du défendeur
[14]
Le défendeur reproduit les conclusions de la Commission quant à la crédibilité du demandeur et soutien que son analyse n'est pas microscopique. Il fait plutôt valoir que la Commission a raisonnablement soupesé les éléments de preuve et a tiré des inférences raisonnables fondées sur des invraisemblances et le bon sens.
[15]
De plus, le défendeur souligne que la Cour fédérale a confirmé que la Commission peut raisonnablement tirer une conclusion à la lumière du fait qu'aucune assignation à comparaître n'a été remise à la famille d'un demandeur qui prétend qu'elle a été visitée par le  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 108 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Compte tenu des doutes qu'avait la Commission sur la crédibilité du demandeur, il était raisonnable d'exiger des éléments de preuve corroborants.
[16]
Enfin, le défendeur admet que le demandeur a déclaré que sa famille avait été harcelée. Toutefois, cette déclaration n'a d'incidence que sur une de ses conclusions à l'égard de la crédibilité du demandeur; la conclusion générale que le demandeur mentait n'est donc aucunement ébranlée par ce fait.
V.
Analyse et décision
A.
Question 1 - Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
[17]
Les conclusions de la Commission doivent être examinées selon la norme de raisonnabilité (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 4, 160 NR 315 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). La décision de la Commission ne devrait pas être infirmée du moment qu'elle est justifiable, transparente, intelligible et que son issue peut se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 47). Autrement dit, je n'annulerai la décision de la Commission que si les motifs ne permettent pas de comprendre ses conclusions ou comment les faits et le droit applicables justifient le résultat (voir
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[18]
Comme la Commission l'a elle-même fait observée, la présomption que le demandeur dit la vérité est le point de départ de l'évaluation de la crédibilité (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
B.
Question 2 - La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son appréciation de la crédibilité du demandeur?
[19]
Bien que certains éléments de la décision de la Commission posent problème, je suis en dernière analyse d'accord avec le défendeur pour dire que la décision est raisonnable.
[20]
En ce qui concerne les conclusions relatives à la vraisemblance d'un témoignage, la Commission ne devrait mettre en doute la crédibilité d'un demandeur que s'il est manifeste que les événements n'ont pu se dérouler de la manière qu'il l'est décrit (
Xu
, paragraphe 17). Notons toutefois que, comme la Cour d'appel l'a d'ailleurs précisé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 4, la Commission est mieux placée que la Cour pour tirer des conclusions à cet égard:
Il ne fait pas de doute que le tribunal spécialisé qu'est la section du statut de réfugié a pleine compétence pour apprécier la plausibilité d'un témoignage. Qui, en effet, mieux que lui, est en mesure de jauger la crédibilité d'un récit et de tirer les inférences qui s'imposent?
Dans la mesure où les inférences que le tribunal tire ne sont pas déraisonnables au point d'attirer notre intervention, ses conclusions sont à l'abri du contrôle judiciaire
.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[21]
Ainsi, je ne retiens pas la prétention du demandeur selon laquelle les conclusions de la Commission devraient pour la plupart faire l'objet d'une intervention de la Cour. En ce qui concerne l'absence des parents de son ami, la Commission a expliqué qu'elle trouvait invraisemblable que les parents, qui habitaient à seulement deux ou trois heures de route, ne soient jamais venus à la maison en trois mois pour voir leur fils et vérifier l'état de la propriété. Elle a également estimé peu probable que le demandeur n'ait jamais demandé à son ami s'il y avait des chances qu'ils reviennent à la maison. Cette inférence me parait plutôt raisonnable.
[22]
Cependant, d'autres arguments du demandeur révèlent l'existence de certains problèmes.
[23]
D'abord, la Commission a jugé invraisemblable que les parents du demandeur se contentent de cacher son exemplaire du livre Zhuan Falun plutôt que de le détruire. Bien que j'estime, comme la Commission, que cela semble peu probable, le demandeur a uniquement affirmé qu'il avait demandé à ses parents de cacher le livre. Il n'a jamais prétendu que c'est ce qu'ils avaient fait. Même si ses parents l'ont détruit, il est plausible qu'ils n'aient rien dit à leur fils.
[24]
Par ailleurs, le demandeur a également fait valoir que la preuve documentaire est contradictoire quant à la question des assignations à comparaître. Une source affirme qu'« une assignation serait presque toujours délivrée à la personne concernée », alors qu'une autre indique que la police remet des assignations aux membres de la famille « tout le temps, notamment lorsque la personne visée par l'assignation est difficile à trouver » (voir Direction des recherches de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada, RDI CHN42444.EF,
Chine: information sur les circonstances dans lesquelles une assignation est délivrée et les autorités responsables de la délivrance
(1er juin 2004), au paragraphe 4). Ceci tient en partie au fait que « l'application de la loi peut varier considérablement en fonction des régions ».
[25]
Néanmoins, la Commission a déterminé qu'il était improbable que le BSP se rende sept fois au domicile de la famille du demandeur et qu'il ne laisse aucune assignation à comparaître.
[26]
La jurisprudence de la Cour sur la question de savoir si une telle conclusion est raisonnable n'est pas unanime. Au paragraphe 35 de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge David Near a fait remarquer que « bien que la preuve documentaire donne à penser que le BSP ne laisse pas toujours nécessairement une assignation à l'intention de l'intéressé, cette preuve ne contredit pas directement la conclusion de la Commission ». Ainsi, le demandeur a simplement démonter qu'une autre conclusion aurait pu être rendue et non que la conclusion tirée était déraisonnable.
[27]
Cela dit, dans d'autres décisions de la Cour, il a été conclu que des inférences similaires n'étaient pas raisonnables. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 532, un demandeur a affirmé que le BSP s'était rendu dix fois à son domicile sans jamais laisser d'assignation à comparaître. La Commission a déterminé que cela était improbable, mais le juge Donald Rennie a jugé que ce raisonnement était erroné et il a précisé au paragraphe 17 que « le témoignage du demandeur fait clairement partie de l'ensemble des issues possibles et il est cohérent avec les éléments de preuve dont la Commission était saisie concernant la situation dans le pays et les pratiques inconstantes du BSP ». Le juge James O'Reilly est également arrivé à une conclusion similaire dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 10, [2010] ACF no 162, à l'instar du juge Michel Shore dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF no 74 [
Liang
].
[28]
En toute déférence, j'estime que ce deuxième point de vue est plus conforme à la jurisprudence de notre Cour portant sur les conclusions relatives à la vraisemblance d'inférences de cette nature. Comme l'a expliqué le juge Shore au paragraphe 14 dans
Liang
, « si la norme de la région où la demanderesse habite veut que le BSP ne laisse aucun mandat ou aucune sommation à une personne autre que celle à qui le document est adressé, cette norme est vraisemblablement suivie, peu importe le nombre de visites [...] ». Ainsi, si cela avait été l'unique fondement de la décision de la Commission, il aurait été déraisonnable qu'elle mette en doute la crédibilité du demandeur simplement parce qu'il avait la malchance de vivre dans une région où l'on respectait la procédure établie pour le persécuter.
[29]
De plus, le défendeur fait remarquer à juste titre que la conclusion de la Commission sur la question des représailles subies par sa famille est problématique. La preuve documentaire qui sous-tend la conclusion de la Commission n'indique pas que toutes les familles des adeptes du Falun Gong subissent toutes les formes de représailles énumérées. En outre, le demandeur a soutenu que sa famille avait été victime de harcèlement. Il était déraisonnable que la Commission conclût que la version du demandeur était improbable.
[30]
Malgré ces erreurs, les autres observations de la Commission résistent à un examen approfondi et justifient ses conclusions négatives sur la crédibilité du demandeur.
[31]
D'une part, notons que le demandeur ne conteste pas plusieurs des inférences tirées par la Commission quant à sa crédibilité, y compris celles relatives aux relevés de notes et aux documents de visite de prison manquants, ainsi que celles qui concernent la guetteuse.
[32]
D'autre part, la Commission n'a jamais fait fi du fait que le demandeur ait dit s'être fait aider par un passeur. Elle a simplement estimé peu probable que le demandeur ait pu quitter la Chine avec son propre passeport, et ce, même avec de l'aide. Son raisonnement sur cette question tient la route.
[33]
Le demandeur soutient également que les conclusions qu'a tirées la Commission à l'égard de son ami Tang relèvent d'une analyse microscopique (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F., S. d'appel)). Cependant, le fait de souligner les incohérences que comportent des détails secondaires n'est pas en soi problématique. De fait, la juge Judith Snider a expliqué dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Admin LR (5th) 27, qu'« une analyse microscopique est une analyse dans le cadre de laquelle la Commission examine un fait qui n'est pas très pertinent pour un point quelconque, a moins de poids que d'autres éléments de preuve et ne joue pas un rôle fondamental dans les questions qui sont en litige dans l'affaire, mais dont on se sert pour trancher cette dernière ».
[34]
Dans l'affaire qui nous occupe, les deux énoncés que conteste le demandeur n'ont pas eu un effet déterminant sur la décision. Ils ont plutôt simplement servi à corroborer la conclusion générale selon laquelle le demandeur n'est pas crédible. Dans ce contexte, il n'y a rien de déraisonnable dans le fait de souligner que le demandeur a omis ou dénaturé certains détails dans son FRP.
[35]
Qui plus est, ni l'une ni l'autre des observations de la Commission n'était en soi déraisonnable. Dans son FRP, le demandeur a indiqué que son ami Tang lui avait parlé du Falun Gong [traduction] «
une journée
d'août, en 2010 » [je souligne], et qu'ils avaient convenu immédiatement d'en faire l'essai. À l'audience, il a plutôt affirmé que Tang lui avait parlé du Falun Gong deux mois avant qu'il en fasse l'essai. Bien que ce ne soit pas un détail particulièrement important, on ne peut pas reprocher à la Commission d'avoir souligné cette incohérence.
[36]
De la même manière, il est curieux que le demandeur n'ait pas mentionné dans son FRP que Tang faisait partie du groupe de personnes arrêtées, surtout compte tenu de la relation étroite qu'il prétend avoir avec lui.
[37]
La Commission a également déterminé que ce n'était pas par « pure coïncidence » que le demandeur avait obtenu un passeport un mois seulement avant la prétendue descente. Bien que j'abonde dans le même sens que le défendeur et estime que cela n'est pas invraisemblable, je trouve cela suspect. À la lumière de tous les éléments de preuve justifiant la conclusion que le demandeur avait inventé son récit, la Commission pouvait à juste titre souligner que cet élément venait aussi soutenir cette conclusion.
[38]
Ainsi, même si je conviens avec le demandeur pour dire que certaines justifications de la Commission posent problème, la majorité de ses conclusions demeurent justes. Ainsi, je demeure en mesure de comprendre pourquoi la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible. La conclusion qu'il ne pratiquait pas vraiment le Falun Gong est donc raisonnable.
[39]
Par conséquent, je rejette la demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[40]
Aucune des parties n'a proposé de question grave de portée générale à des fins de certification.
