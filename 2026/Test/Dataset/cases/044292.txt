Pinard, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of the decision of Karine Amato, an immigration officer for the Canada Border Services Agency (the "officer"), pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,
S.C. 2001, c. 27, (the "Act") by Yoonis Samtar Guleed (the "applicant"). In her decision, the officer concluded that the applicant's claim for refugee status was ineligible for referral to the Refuge Protection Division ("RPD") pursuant to paragraphs 101(1)(
d
) and 104(1)(
a
) of the Act: the applicant had been recognized refugee status in the United States and could be returned to that country.
* * * * * * * *
[2]
The applicant is a citizen of Somalia. Due to the conditions in Somalia, notably the coup d'État occurring in 1991 and the state of continual violence within the country, the applicant being from the minority Migdan tribe, left his home and subsequently moved around. In 2002, he left for the United States and claimed refugee status. In April 2003, he was granted refugee status in the United States.
[3]
In 2009, he was convicted of the crimes of hit & run and arson in Virginia, serving a prison term from October 2009 to March 2010. However, after being released, the applicant alleges that his American lawyer had told him that he risked losing his refugee status and being deported to Somalia due to these criminal convictions. Consequently, he left the United States on September 31, 2010, arriving in Canada on October 1, 2010. The applicant subsequently claimed refugee status based on race and membership in a particular social group, in addition to a risk to his life and a risk of cruel and unusual treatment if forced to return to Somalia.
[4]
However, upon arrival in Canada, the applicant used his cousin's name as an alias to enter the country (Ilyas Ali Gulet), fearing his criminal convictions in the United States would hinder his refugee claim in Canada. On February 18, 2011, the applicant was reported inadmissible under paragraphs 20(1)(
a
) and 41(
a
) of the Act due to his failure to obtain a permanent resident visa before seeking admission to Canada on a permanent basis. Consequently, a departure order was issued against him. His refugee claim was nonetheless found to be eligible and was referred to the Immigration Refugee Board ("IRB"). It is at this time that the applicant revealed his true identity and that he had been granted refugee status in the United States.
[5]
On February 25, 2011, the Canada Border Services Agency ("CBSA") informed the officer by email that the American authorities had confirmed that the applicant could return to the United States, despite his prior criminal conviction. The enforcement superintendent for the CBSA, Mr. Storozuk, later met with the U.S. immigration officer to obtain the necessary information on the applicant's US refugee claim and to obtain a verbal confirmation that the applicant would be admitted upon return.
[6]
In a letter dated March 24, 2011, the officer scheduled an interview with the applicant for April 14, 2011, in order to discuss his refugee status in the United States. The applicant was invited to provide written submissions and additional evidence before the officer would render her final decision. In a letter dated April 18, 2011, the applicant's legal counsel outlined his major arguments, notably that he could not return to the United States due to his prior criminal convictions which made him an alien guilty of a crime of moral turpitude under the
Immigration and Nationality Act
, Pub. L. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163 (June 27, 1952) (the "
INA
") (sections 212(2)A(i)(I) and 101(3) of the
INA
). Moreover, the applicant argued that he could not return to the United States because he did not possess the valid travel documents required to be readmitted into the country.
[7]
On April 20, 2011, after the interview between the applicant and an associate of the officer's, the officer notified the applicant of his ineligibility. Afterwards, the applicant was informed that he could apply for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment, which he did on May 27, 2011.
[8]
In her letter to the applicant dated April 20, 2011, pursuant to section 104 of the Act, the officer notified the applicant that his claim for refugee protection in Canada was ineligible for consideration: he was found to be a Convention refugee in another country than Canada and can be returned to that country as per paragraph 101(1)(
d
) of the Act. The officer does not provide any additional information and does not comment on any of the representations made by the applicant at the interview.
[9]
Consequently, on April 26, 2011, the applicant filed the present application for judicial review of the officer's finding of ineligibility.
* * * * * * * *
[10]
The relevant legislation is annexed to these reasons for convenience.
[11]
The applicant raises the following issues:
i. Did the officer breach her duty of procedural fairness in failing to provide adequate reasons for her decision?
ii. Did the officer further breach her duty of procedural fairness by refusing to disclose the information she received from the U.S. authorities, thereby depriving the applicant of the opportunity to respond?
[12]
The applicable standard of review to such issues of procedural fairness is correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
* * * * * * * *
i. Did the officer breach her duty of procedural fairness in failing to provide adequate reasons for her decision?
[13]
The applicant claims the officer breached her duty of procedural fairness in failing to provide reasons for her ineligibility finding. Her written reasons consist of one sentence and do not address any of the applicant's submissions, nor whether he can actually return to the United States. The applicant relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Baker
] to establish the officer's duty to provide reasons.
[14]
The applicant alleges that the officer did not explain why the applicant can be returned to the United States despite his criminal convictions and the lack of the requisite refugee travel documents (section 223.1 of the
Code of Federal Regulations
, 8 C.F.R.). The applicant therefore claims that the officer's reasons do not allow for a meaningful review of the merits of her ineligibility finding (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  comes to a different conclusion. The respondent submits that the officer's decision, while short, contains all the necessary information allowing for a meaningful review. The respondent submits that the applicant's record is evidence that he had all the materials necessary to contest the merits of the officer's ineligibility determination.
[16]
In
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, supra, on the issue of the "adequacy" of reasons, the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following at paragraphs 14, 15, 16 and 18:
[14] Read as a whole, I do not see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> as standing for the proposition that the "adequacy" of reasons is a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision, or as advocating that a reviewing court undertake two discrete analyses - one for the reasons and a separate one for the result (Donald J. M. Brown and John M. Evans,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada
(loose-leaf) at § 12:5330 and 12:5510). It is a more organic exercise - the reasons must be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes. This, it seems to me, is what the Court was saying in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> when it told reviewing courts to look at "the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes" (para. 47).
[15] . . . This means that courts should not substitute their own reasons, but they may, if they find it necessary, look to the record for the purpose of assessing the reasonableness of the outcome.
[16] Reasons may not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that does not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result under a reasonableness analysis. A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion (
Service Employees' International Union, Local No. 333 v. Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn.
, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 382, at p. 391). In other words, if the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria are met.
[18] . . . I found the description by the Respondents in their Factum particularly helpful in explaining the nature of the exercise:
"When reviewing a decision of an administrative body on the reasonableness standard, the guiding principle is deference. Reasons are not to be reviewed in a vacuum - the result is to be looked at in the context of the evidence, the parties' submissions and the process. Reasons do not have to be perfect. They do not have to be comprehensive. [para. 44] "
[17]
With these principles in mind, the officer did have an obligation to inform the applicant of her ineligibility finding (paragraph 104(1)(
a
) of the Act). However, the officer did not have a duty to provide detailed reasons. The officer did not have any obligation to provide extensive reasons in making her decision under section 104 of the Act, but rather had to appraise the evidence.
[18]
In her decision, the officer told the applicant why he was ineligible: he had been recognized refugee status in the United States and could be returned to that country, as per paragraph 101(1)(
d
) of the Act. The applicant was given a meaningful opportunity to advance his views and present evidence at the interview. I further agree with the respondent that since the applicant was fully capable of bringing the present application for judicial review, the reasons given by the officer were sufficient.
[19]
Moreover, the Guidelines do not impose any additional procedural safeguards on the officer, besides requiring that her decision be based on the evidence, that it take into account the applicant's observations, that the applicant be notified of her decision and that the evidence be disclosed. There is no longer any specific requirement under the Act obligating the officer to provide reasons, contrary to the former requirement under the Act. Under former subsection 45(3) of the Act, reasons were required in cases of an ineligibility finding terminating an applicant's claim for refugee protection.
[20]
For these reasons, given that the burden of proving eligibility was on the applicant (subsection 100(4) of the Act), the officer's reasons were adequate. We do know why the applicant was ineligible: he has refugee status in the Untied States and can be returned to that country since the officer obtained assurances from the American authorities. In my view, in the context of the evidence, "the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes" (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, supra, at para 16).
ii. Did the officer breach her duty of procedural fairness by refusing to disclose the information she received from the U.S. authorities, thereby depriving the applicant of the opportunity to respond?
[21]
The applicant further argues that the officer erred in refusing to disclose the specific information she received from the U.S. authorities, thereby depriving him of an opportunity to respond. Rather, the officer had a duty to disclose the emails between the Canadian and American authorities regarding the applicant's return to the United States. The applicant submits that while he was informed by the CBSA of the U.S. authorities' assurances, his request to review the emails was denied. Consequently, he was left to speculate as to why he would be allowed to return, considering the provisions of the
INA
dealing with aliens and crimes of moral turpitude.
[22]
The respondent, for his part, asserts that the officer did not have a duty to disclose the email correspondences between the Canadian and American authorities because such information was protected under article 6 of the
Statement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing
and article 7 of the
Annex Regarding the Sharing of Information on Asylum and Refugee Status Claims to the Statement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing
.
[23]
The applicant was informed of the assurances provided by the U.S. authorities. While he requested the disclosure of these assurances, the respondent claims that the information is also privileged under sections 37 and 38 of the
Canada Evidence Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.
[24]
The respondent goes on to explain that an officer's duty to disclose evidence in the present context must also be accessed in light of the factors set out in
Baker
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Unlike the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the officer's ineligibility determination does not put an end to the applicant's quest for protection within Canada, but restricts his choice of procedure. In such circumstances, the respondent does not believe the officer had any obligation to provide copies of the emails and disclose their specific contents.
[25]
Therefore, the officer did not violate any principles of natural justice: her decision was based on the evidence, her reasons were sufficient and she communicated to the applicant the available evidence, allowing him to meaningfully participate in the ineligibility determination.
[26]
The test to determine if an officer had a duty to disclose extrinsic evidence is whether the disclosure of the document was required to provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity in all circumstances to participate in a meaningful manner in the decision-making process ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 26;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In applying the factors set out in
Baker
, in order to qualify an officer's duty to disclose, this Court must be mindful of the extent to which a duty to disclose the emails would likely have avoided the risk of error in making the decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 28).
[27]
Unlike in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , disclosure of the emails would not have provided the applicant with the opportunity to comment on alleged errors, omissions or other deficiencies (at para 37). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , an officer considering a claim on humanitarian and compassionate grounds had a duty to disclose in order to avoid such errors, given that the evidence at issue, a post-claim determination officer's risk assessment report, was derived from voluminous, nuanced and inconsistent information in different sources on country conditions (at para 37).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the applicability of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was limited to its specific context: an officer determining an application based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds had a duty to disclose to the applicant a risk assessment report (at para 33). Hence, past case law is of limited utility: an inquiry into what is required to satisfy an officer's duty of fairness must be contextualized ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 15). Thereby a conclusion reached in one context cannot automatically be transposed to another ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 15).
[28]
Moreover, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada tempers the duty to disclose, acknowledging that the material on which the Minister bases his decision must be provided to the refugee,
subject
to privilege and other reasons for reduced disclosure.
[29]
The officer did not have a duty to disclose the contents of the emails between the Canadian and American authorities. Rather, it was sufficient that the applicant was aware of their existence. This disclosure of their existence was sufficient, in my opinion, to provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity in all circumstances to participate in a meaningful manner in the officer's determination. Even if the applicant had read the specific contents of the emails, it would not have enabled him to comment on alleged errors, omissions or other deficiencies in these messages ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
Rather, the officer had the obligation to make further inquiries about the applicant's status in the United States, which she did. She also granted the applicant an interview and allowed him to make submissions, as per the Guidelines.
[31]
Moreover, the emails appear to be protected by the
Statement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing
between Canada and the United States.
[32]
Therefore, I do not believe the officer had a duty to disclose the emails between the Canadian and American authorities to the applicant. It was sufficient that the applicant was aware of their existence and the assurances they provided: the applicant was given a reasonable opportunity in all circumstances to participate in a meaningful manner in the officer's determination (
Baker, Haghighi
).

For the above-mentioned reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.
[34]
The parties declined to propose any question for certification.

to promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights and by denying access to the United States and Canada to persons who are criminals or security risks.
Article 3: Conditions for Exchange of Information Under the SMU
Unless otherwise specified in any Annex to this SMU, the Participants are to share information under the SMU consistent with domestic law and the purposes set out in Article 2 if any of the following circumstances exist
:
there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the information would be relevant to the administration or enforcement of the citizenship or immigration laws of either Canada or the United States;
Article 6: Subsequent Uses and Treatment
Subsequent uses and treatment of information shared under this SMU and its annexes are restricted by the following conditions:
a. Information is shared between the Participants pursuant to an express understanding of strict confidentiality. Such information, as well as inquiries and requests for information, received by a Participant under this SMU is to be accorded protection from disclosure to third parties as provided under the laws and policies of the receiving Participant with regard to such information;
Receiving Participants are not to use or disclose the information provided under this SMU except for the purposes enumerated in Article 2 or the Annexes, or as otherwise required by the laws of the Participant;
The Participants are to obtain written permission for the disclosure to third parties of any confidential information received pursuant to this SMU prior to such disclosure, or as specified in the Annexes, unless there is a compelling need that would justify a Participant's not making such a written request, in which case the requesting Participant is to give written notice of the disclosure to the providing Participant as soon as practicable; however
The Participants acknowledge that written permission is not required for disclosure of information to agencies participating as signatories of the SMU and other agencies in the performance of their citizenship, immigration or border management functions (including the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. Department of Defense, Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada, Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Canadian Department of National Defence; Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or their successors and with oversight and review agencies within the United States and Canada);
A receiving Participant is to provide notice to any third party to which it discloses information received in confidence under the SMU that the third party is prohibited from further disclosure unless it obtains authorization from the providing Participant; and
To prevent the unauthorized disclosure, copying, use, or modification of information provided to a Participant under this SMU, receiving Participants are to restrict access to such information on a need to know basis, and use recognized security mechanisms such as passwords, encryption, or other reasonable safeguards to prevent unauthorized access.
Annex Regarding the Sharing of Information on Asylym and Refugee Status Claims to the Statement of Mutual Understanding on Information Sharing
:
Article 3: Applicability
This Annex does not apply to refugee status claims made by persons who are citizens of Canada or the United States or who, not having a country of nationality, are habitual residents of Canada or the United States. This Annex applies to sharing, on a systematic or case-by-case basis, of information concerning refugee status claims made in either Participant's territory. This Annex does not preclude sharing of information on a case-by-case pursuant to the SMU or any other annex to the SMU.
Article 5: Data Elements to be shared
There are four broad categories of information that may be shared:
information relating to the identity of the refugee status claimant;
information relating to the processing of the refugee status claim;
information relevant to a decision to deny a refugee status claimant access to, to exclude such a claimant from the protection of, the refugee determination system, or to terminate, cancel or revoke an individual's existing refugee status in the United States or Canada; and
information regarding the substance or history of previous refugee status claim(s) that will assist in determining a subsequent refugee status claim.
1. Information relating to the identity of the refugee status claimant
Information concerning the identity of a refugee status claimant is essential to the determination of a refugee status claim. In order to establish the identity of a refugee status claimant, the officer relies upon biographic, descriptive or biometrics data. Not all of the identifying data characteristics listed below may be available for each refugee status claimant. The identification information that may be shared under this Annex includes, but is not limited to:
o Name and aliases used;
o Client identification number (for respective Participant's reference only);
o Gender (both birth and post-operative, if applicable);
o Physical description;
o Biometrics, including fingerprints, photographs and physical descriptions;
o Date of birth (both claimed and actual);
o Country of birth (both claimed and actual);
o Nationality or nationalities (both claimed and actual);
o Information relating to identity documents (e.g. passport number); and
o Other relevant identification data (e.g., FBI number, driver's license number).
2. Information relating to the processing of the refugee status claim
Information regarding the status of a previous or ongoing refugee status claim in the country of one Participant is relevant to the determination of a refugee status claim in the country of the other Participant. This information refers to the processing of the person's refugee status claim in Canada or the United States, and consists of, but is not limited to:
o Information regarding whether the refugee status claim was denied access to the refugee determination system, has been decided, remains pending, or has been declared abandoned or voluntarily withdrawn;
o If the refugee status claim has been decided, information on whether protection was granted or denied, including the disposition of any appeals; and
o Information regarding the cessation or vacation of a determination on a refugee status claim.
3. Information relevant to a decision to deny a refugee status claimant access to, or exclude such a claimant from the protection of, the refugee status determination system or to terminate, cancel or revoke an individual's existing refugee status in the United States or Canada.
This information is relevant to the decision whether or not to allow the refugee status claimant access to the refugee status determination system. This information may also be relevant to the decision as to whether or not a person ought to be excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1E or 1F or denied protection according to Article 33(2) of the 1951 Convention, as implemented in the refugee status determination systems of the Participants. In Canada, this information may also be relevant to the decision as to whether the Minister of Immigration decides to participate in the refugee status determination process pursuant to Canadian law. The information that may be shared includes, but is not limited to:
o Information related to a determination that a refugee status claimant falls or fell within the provisions of Article 1E or 1F of the 1951 Convention Relating to Status of Refugees, as implemented by the Participant;
o Information related to a determination that a refugee status claimant falls or fell within the provisions of Article 33(2) of the 1951 Convention Relating to Status of Refugees, as implemented by the Participant;
o Information concerning any outstanding criminal warrants or criminal convictions pertaining to a refugee status claimant, or the nature of any criminal offence that either Participant has reasonable grounds to suspect a refugee status claimant has committed;
o Information concerning security allegations pertaining to a refugee status claimant, or the nature of any security risk that either Participant has reasonable grounds to suspect a refugee status claimant might present;
o Information related to outstanding immigration warrants pertaining to a refugee status claimant or the nature of any immigration offence(s) that either Participant has reasonable grounds to suspect a refugee status claimant has committed.
4. Information regarding the substance or history of any previous refugee status claim(s) that will assist in determining a subsequent refugee status claim.
Information regarding previous refugee status claims is relevant to the assessment of subsequent claims, including the assessment of credibility. Such information includes, but is not limited to:
o Country of last habitual residence;
o Address;
o Marital status and family composition;
o Immigration status;
o Date(s) of arrival;
o Places(s) of entry;
o Manner of entry;
o Information concerning routes of travel;
o Occupational information;
o Education;
o Information submitted in support of a refugee status claim;
o Information related to the substance of the refugee status claim; and
o Records of decisions taken with respect to the refugee status claim, including reasons.
Article 6: Mechanism for Sharing Data
b. Case-by-case sharing of information
In addition to the systematic sharing of information, the Participants may, in accordance with procedures set forth in the SMU, share information described in Article 5 of this Annex concerning refugee status claims on a case-by-case basis pursuant to the request of either Participant.
Article 7: Confidentiality
A. Each Participant is to protect from disclosure to any non-participant, to the fullest extent provided under its country's laws and regulations, any and all information, inquiries and requests for information received from the other Participants under this Annex.
b. Protection of a refugee status claimant includes protecting the confidentiality of an individual's identity and of the information provided in the individual's refugee status claim, including the fact that an individual has submitted a refugee status claim. Unauthorized release of such information may place the refugee status claimant or a member of the refugee status claimant's family at risk of serious harm, including persecution and torture. Consequently, each Participant is to treat as confidential and protect from disclosure to any non-participant, to the fullest extent provided under its country's laws and regulations, any and all information, inquiries, and requests for information received from the other Participant under this Annex. The Participants are to seek to ensure that information is not exchanged or disclosed to a Participant or non-Participant in such a way as to place refugee status claimants or their families at risk in their countries of nationality, or if stateless, countries of last habitual residence.
c. The Participants acknowledge that written permission is not required, pursuant to Article 6(c)(i) of the SMU, for the disclosure of information related to the refugee status claim to other agencies to further their adjudication or review of refugee status claims. Thus, a Participant may, for example, release confidential information to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, United States federal courts, and the Immigration and Refugee Board and Federal Court of Canada, in connection with or in furtherance of the adjudication of a refugee status claim.
d. Disclosure by the receiving Participant of any information received under this Annex to foreign governments or international organizations requires the written consent of the providing Participant.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision de Karine Amato, une agente d'immigration de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l'agente), en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), présentée par Yoonis Samtar Guleed (le demandeur). Dans sa décision, l'agente a conclu que la demande d'asile du demandeur était irrecevable et ne pouvait être déférée à la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR), aux termes des alinéas 101(1)
d
) et 104(1)
a
) de la Loi, au motif que le statut de réfugié avait été reconnu au demandeur aux États-Unis et que le demandeur pouvait être renvoyé dans ce pays.
* * * * * * * *
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen de la Somalie. En raison de la situation en Somalie, notamment du coup d'État survenu en 1991, et de la situation de violence continue dans le pays, le demandeur, étant issu de la tribu minoritaire Migdan, a quitté son domicile, puis s'est déplacé à plusieurs reprises. En 2002, il est parti pour les États-Unis et a demandé l'asile. En avril 2003, il a obtenu le statut de réfugié aux États-Unis.
[3]
En 2009, le demandeur a été déclaré coupable de délit de fuite et d'incendie criminel en Virginie, et il a purgé une peine d'emprisonnement d'octobre 2009 à mars 2010. Cependant, après avoir été libéré, le demandeur allègue que son avocat américain lui avait dit qu'il risquait de perdre son statut de réfugié et d'être expulsé vers la Somalie à cause de ces condamnations au criminel. Il a donc quitté les États-Unis le 30 septembre 2010, et il est arrivé au Canada le 1er octobre 2010. Il a ensuite demandé l'asile sur le fondement de sa race et de son appartenance à un group social, en plus de l'allégation selon laquelle il serait exposé à une menace à sa vie et au risque de traitements cruels et inusités s'il était forcé de retourner en Somalie.
[4]
Cependant, à son arrivée au Canada, le demandeur a utilisé le nom de son cousin comme nom d'emprunt pour entrer au pays (Ilyas Ali Gulet), craignant que ses condamnations au criminel aux États-Unis ne nuisent à sa demande d'asile au Canada. Le 18 février 2011, le demandeur a été déclaré interdit de territoire au titre de l'alinéa 20(1)
a
) et de l'article 41 de la Loi, en raison de son défaut d'obtenir un visa de résident permanent avant de demander d'être admis au Canada à titre permanent. En conséquence, une mesure d'interdiction de séjour a été prise contre lui. Sa demande d'asile a néanmoins été déclarée recevable et a été déférée à la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (CISR). C'est à ce moment que le demandeur a révélé sa véritable identité et le fait qu'il avait obtenu le statut de réfugié aux États-Unis.
[5]
Le 25 février 2011, l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l'ASFC) a informé l'agente par courriel que les autorités américaines avaient confirmé que le demandeur pouvait retourner aux États-Unis, malgré sa condamnation antérieure au criminel. Le surintendant à l'exécution de la loi de l'ASFC, M. Storozuk, a ensuite rencontré l'agent d'immigration américain pour obtenir les renseignements nécessaires au sujet de la demande d'asile du demandeur aux États-Unis et obtenir une confirmation verbale que le demandeur serait admis à son retour.
[6]
Dans une lettre datée du 24 mars 2011, l'agente a convoqué le demandeur à une entrevue le 14 avril 2011, pour discuter de son statut de réfugié aux États-Unis. Le demandeur a été invité à présenter des observations écrites et des éléments de preuve additionnels avant que l'agente rende une décision définitive. Dans une lettre datée du 18 avril 2011, l'avocat du demandeur a exposé ses principaux arguments, notamment qu'il ne pouvait pas retourner aux États-Unis en raison de ses condamnations antérieures au criminel qui faisaient de lui un étranger coupable d'un crime impliquant turpitude morale au sens de l'
Immigration and Nationality Act
, Pub L 82-414, 66 Stat 163 (27 juin 1952) (l'INA) (division 212(2)A(i)(I) et paragraphe 101(3) de l'INA). En outre, le demandeur soutenait qu'il ne pouvait pas retourner aux États-Unis, parce qu'il ne possédait pas les titres de voyage valides requis pour être réadmis au pays.
[7]
Le 20 avril 2011, après qu'un collègue de l'agente eut interrogé le demandeur, l'agente a avisé le demandeur que sa demande était irrecevable. Par la suite, le demandeur a été informé qu'il pouvait demander une évaluation des risques avant renvoi, ce qu'il a fait le 27 mai 2011.
[8]
Dans sa lettre au demandeur datée du 20 avril 2011, au titre de l'article 104 de la Loi, l'agente a avisé le demandeur que sa demande d'asile au Canada était irrecevable, parce qu'il avait été statué qu'il avait qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention dans un autre pays que le Canada et il pouvait être renvoyé dans ce pays, conformément à l'alinéa 101(1)
d
) de la Loi. L'agente ne fournit aucun renseignement additionnel et ne commente aucune des observations que le demandeur a présentées lors de l'entrevue.
[9]
Par conséquent, le 26 avril 2011, le demandeur a déposé la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire du constat d'irrecevabilité de l'agente.
* * * * * * * *
[10]
Les dispositions législatives pertinentes sont reproduites en annexe aux présents motifs par souci de commodité.
[11]
Le demandeur soulève les questions suivantes:
i. L'agente a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en omettant de donner des motifs suffisants au soutien de sa décision?
ii. L'agente a-t-elle en outre manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en refusant de communiquer les renseignements qu'elle avait reçus des autorités américaines, privant ainsi le demandeur de la possibilité de répondre?
[12]
La norme de contrôle applicable à de telles questions d'équité procédurale est la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
* * * * * * * *
i. L'agente a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en omettant de donner des motifs suffisants au soutien de sa décision?
[13]
Le demandeur soutient que l'agente a manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en omettant de donner des motifs au soutien de son constat d'irrecevabilité. Ses motifs écrits tiennent en une phrase et ne traitent d'aucune des observations du demandeur ni de la question de savoir s'il peut effectivement retourner aux États-Unis. Le demandeur invoque l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Baker
), pour établir l'obligation de l'agente de donner des motifs.
[14]
Le demandeur allègue que l'agente n'a pas expliqué pourquoi le demandeur pouvait retourner aux États-Unis malgré ses condamnations au criminel et le fait qu'il ne possède pas le titre de voyage pour réfugiés requis (article 223.1 du
Code of Federal Regulations
, 8 CFR). Le demandeur soutient donc que les motifs de l'agente ne permettent pas un examen valable du bien-fondé de son constat d'irrecevabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  en arrive à une conclusion différente. Le défendeur soutient que la décision de l'agente, bien que brève, contient tous les renseignements nécessaires pour permettre un examen valable. Le défendeur soutient que le dossier du demandeur fournit la preuve qu'il disposait de tous les documents nécessaires pour contester le bien-fondé du constat d'irrecevabilité de l'agente.
[16]
Dans l'arrêt
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, précité, sur la question de la « suffisance » des motifs, la Cour suprême du Canada a affirmé ce qui suit aux paragraphes 14, 15, 16 et 18:
[14] Je ne suis pas d'avis que, considéré dans son ensemble, l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> signifie que l' « insuffisance » des motifs permet à elle seule de casser une décision, ou que les cours de révision doivent effectuer deux analyses distinctes, l'une portant sur les motifs et l'autre, sur le résultat (Donald J. M. Brown et John M. Evans,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada
(feuilles mobiles), à § 12:5330 et 12:5510). Il s'agit d'un exercice plus global: les motifs doivent être examinés en corrélation avec le résultat et ils doivent permettre de savoir si ce dernier fait partie des issues possibles. Il me semble que c'est ce que la Cour voulait dire dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> en invitant les cours de révision à se demander si « la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité » (par. 47).
[15] [...] [La cour de révision] ne doit donc pas substituer ses propres motifs à ceux de la décision sous examen mais peut toutefois, si elle le juge nécessaire, examiner le dossier pour apprécier le caractère raisonnable du résultat.
[16] Il se peut que les motifs ne fassent pas référence à tous les arguments, dispositions législatives, précédents ou autres détails que le juge siégeant en révision aurait voulu y lire, mais cela ne met pas en doute leur validité ni celle du résultat au terme de l'analyse du caractère raisonnable de la décision. Le décideur n'est pas tenu de tirer une conclusion explicite sur chaque élément constitutif du raisonnement, si subordonné soit-il, qui a mené à sa conclusion finale (
Union internationale des employés des services, local no 333 c. Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn.
, [1975] 1 R.C.S. 382, à la p. 391). En d'autres termes, les motifs répondent aux critères établis dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s'ils permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables.
[...]
[18] [...] J'estime que la description de l'exercice que donnent les intimées dans leur mémoire est particulièrement utile pour en décrire la nature:
[traduction] La déférence est le principe directeur qui régit le contrôle de la décision d'un tribunal administratif selon la norme de la décision raisonnable. Il ne faut pas examiner les motifs dans l'abstrait; il faut examiner le résultat dans le contexte de la preuve, des arguments des parties et du processus. Il n'est pas nécessaire que les motifs soient parfaits ou exhaustifs. [par. 44]
[17]
Gardant à l'esprit ces principes, l'agente avait certes l'obligation d'informer le demandeur de son constat d'irrecevabilité (alinéa 104(1)
a
) de la Loi). Cependant, l'agente n'avait pas l'obligation de fournir des motifs détaillés. L'agente n'avait aucune obligation de fournir de longs motifs au moment de rendre sa décision au titre de l'article 104 de la Loi, mais devait plutôt apprécier les éléments de preuve.
[18]
Dans sa décision, l'agente a dit au demandeur pourquoi sa demande était irrecevable: le statut de réfugié lui avait été reconnu aux États-Unis et il pouvait être renvoyé dans ce pays, conformément à l'alinéa 101(1)
d
) de la Loi. Le demandeur a eu une occasion valable de faire valoir son point de vue et de présenter des éléments de preuve lors de l'entrevue. Je conviens en outre avec le défendeur que, puisque le demandeur a été pleinement capable de soumettre la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire, les motifs donnés par l'agente étaient suffisants.
[19]
En outre, les lignes directrices ne prévoient aucune autre garantie procédurale incombant à l'agente, mis à part qu'elles exigent que sa décision soit fondée sur la preuve, qu'elle tienne compte des observations du demandeur, que le demandeur soit avisé de cette décision et que les éléments de preuve soient communiqués. La Loi n'impose plus aucune obligation précise à l'agent de donner des motifs, contrairement à ce qu'elle prévoyait autrefois. Selon l'ancien paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi, des motifs devaient être donnés dans les cas d'un constat d'irrecevabilité mettant fin à la demande d'asile d'un demandeur.
[20]
Pour ces motifs, étant donné que la preuve de la recevabilité incombait au demandeur (paragraphe 100(4) de la Loi), les motifs de l'agente étaient suffisants. Nous savons pourquoi la demande du demandeur était irrecevable: il a le statut de réfugié aux États-Unis et il peut être renvoyé dans ce pays, puisque l'agente a obtenu des assurances des autorités américaines. À mon avis, compte tenu des éléments de preuve, « les motifs [...] permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables » (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union
, précité, au paragraphe 16).
ii. L'agente a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en refusant de communiquer les renseignements qu'elle avait reçus des autorités américaines, privant ainsi le demandeur de la possibilité d'y répondre?
[21]
Le demandeur soutient en outre que l'agente a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a refusé de communiquer les renseignements précis qu'elle avait reçus des autorités américaines, le privant ainsi de la possibilité de répondre. Le demandeur soutient que l'agente avait l'obligation de communiquer les courriels entre les autorités canadiennes et américaines concernant le retour du demandeur aux États-Unis. Le demandeur soutient que, bien que l'ASFC l'ait informé au sujet des assurances données par les autorités américaines, sa demande d'examen des courriels a été rejetée. Par conséquent, il n'a pu que spéculer quant à savoir pourquoi il serait autorisé à retourner, compte tenu des dispositions de l'INA relatives aux étrangers et aux crimes impliquant turpitude morale.
[22]
Le défendeur, quant à lui, affirme que l'agente n'avait pas d'obligation de communiquer les correspondances par courriel entre les autorités canadiennes et américaines, parce que ces renseignements sont protégés au titre de l'article 6 de la Déclaration d'entente mutuelle sur l'échange d'information et de l'article 7 de l'Annexe concernant l'échange d'information sur les demandes d'asile et du statut de réfugié à la Déclaration d'entente mutuelle sur l'échange d'information.
[23]
Le demandeur a été informé des assurances données par les autorités américaines. Bien qu'il ait demandé la communication de ces assurances, le défendeur soutient que les renseignements sont également privilégiés aux termes des articles 37 et 38 de la
Loi sur la preuve au Canada
, LRC 1985, c C-5.
[24]
Le défendeur explique ensuite que l'obligation d'un agent de communiquer les éléments de preuve dans le présent contexte doit également s'apprécier à la lumière des facteurs énoncés dans l'arrêt
Baker
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )). Contrairement à l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le constat d'irrecevabilité de l'agente ne met pas fin aux tentatives du demandeur d'obtenir l'asile depuis le Canada, mais limite son choix de recours. Dans ces circonstances, le défendeur ne croit pas que l'agente avait l'obligation de fournir des copies des courriels ni d'en communiquer le contenu précis.
[25]
Par conséquent, l'agente n'a violé aucun principe de justice naturelle: sa décision était fondée sur les éléments de preuve, ses motifs étaient suffisants, et elle a communiqué au demandeur les éléments de preuve disponibles, lui permettant ainsi de participer valablement au processus décisionnel qui a mené au constat d'irrecevabilité.
[26]
Le critère pour déterminer si un agent avait l'obligation de communiquer des éléments de preuve extrinsèque tient à la question de savoir si la communication du document était nécessaire pour donner au demandeur une possibilité raisonnable, vu l'ensemble des circonstances, de participer de manière significative au processus de prise de décision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 26;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 40). Lorsqu'elle applique les facteurs énoncés dans l'arrêt
Baker
, afin de cerner l'obligation de communication d'un agent, la Cour doit garder à l'esprit la mesure dans laquelle une obligation de communiquer les courriels aurait été susceptible d'éviter le risque d'erreur dans la prise de la décision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 28).
[27]
Contrairement à dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la communication des courriels n'aurait pas donné au demandeur la possibilité de faire des observations sur les erreurs, les omissions et les autres lacunes alléguées (au paragraphe 37). Dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , un agent qui examinait une demande fondée sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire avait une obligation de communiquer afin d'éviter de telles erreurs, étant donné que l'élément de preuve dont il était question, soit le rapport d'évaluation des risques d'un agent établi après le dépôt de la demande, avait été rédigé à partir d'une grande quantité de renseignements comportant des nuances et des incompatibilités tirés de différentes sources sur la situation dans le pays dont il était question (au paragraphe 37). Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'applicabilité de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a été limitée à son contexte précis: un agent statuant sur une demande fondée sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire avait l'obligation de communiquer au demandeur un rapport d'évaluation des risques (au paragraphe 33). La jurisprudence antérieure est donc d'une utilité limitée: l'enquête sur ce qui est requis pour respecter l'obligation d'agir avec équité doit être faite selon le contexte ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 15). Ainsi, la conclusion tirée dans un contexte particulier ne devrait pas automatiquement être étendue à un autre contexte ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 15).
[28]
En outre, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada nuance l'obligation de communiquer, en reconnaissant que les documents sur lesquels le ministre fonde sa décision doivent être communiqués au réfugié,
sous réserve
de l'existence d'un privilège ou d'autres motifs justifiant de limiter la communication.
[29]
L'agente n'avait pas l'obligation de communiquer le contenu des courriels entre les autorités canadiennes et américaines. Il était suffisant que le demandeur soit mis au courant de leur existence. Cette divulgation de leur existence était suffisante, à mon avis, pour donner au demandeur une possibilité raisonnable, vu l'ensemble des circonstances, de participer de manière significative au processus de prise de décision de l'agente. Même si le demandeur avait lu le contenu précis des courriels, cela ne lui aurait pas donné la possibilité de faire des observations sur les erreurs, les omissions et les autres lacunes alléguées dans ces messages ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
L'agente avait plutôt l'obligation de faire d'autres vérifications au sujet du statut du demandeur aux États-Unis, ce qu'elle a fait. Elle a aussi accordé une entrevue au demandeur et lui a permis de présenter des observations, conformément aux lignes directrices.
[31]
En outre, les courriels semblent être protégés en vertu de la Déclaration d'entente mutuelle sur l'échange d'information entre le Canada et les États-Unis.
[32]
Par conséquent, je ne crois pas que l'agente avait l'obligation de communiquer au demandeur les courriels entre les autorités canadiennes et américaines. Il était suffisant que le demandeur soit mis au courant de leur existence et des assurances qu'ils donnaient: le demandeur a eu une possibilité raisonnable, vu l'ensemble des circonstances, de participer de manière significative au processus de prise de décision de l'agente (
Baker, Haghighi

Opposition devant une cour supérieure
(2) Si l'opposition est portée devant une cour supérieure, celle-ci peut décider la question.
Opposition devant une autre instance
(3) Si l'opposition est portée devant un tribunal, un organisme ou une personne qui ne constituent pas une cour supérieure, la question peut être décidée, sur demande, par:
a
) la Cour fédérale, dans les cas où l'organisme ou la personne investis du pouvoir de contraindre à la production de renseignements sous le régime d'une loi fédérale ne constituent pas un tribunal régi par le droit d'une province;
b) la division ou le tribunal de première instance de la cour supérieure de la province dans le ressort de laquelle le tribunal, l'organisme ou la personne ont compétence, dans les autres cas.
Délai

Objection to disclosure of information
37. (1) Subject to sections 38 to 38.16, a Minister of the Crown in right of Canada or other official may object to the disclosure of information before a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information by certifying orally or in writing to the court, person or body that the information should not be disclosed on the grounds of a specified public interest.
Obligation of court, person or body
(1.1) If an objection is made under subsection (1), the court, person or body shall ensure that the information is not disclosed other than in accordance with this Act.
Objection made to superior court
(2) If an objection to the disclosure of information is made before a superior court, that court may determine the objection.
Objection not made to superior court
(3) If an objection to the disclosure of information is made before a court, person or body other than a superior court, the objection may be determined, on application, by

a
) the Federal Court, in the case of a person or body vested with power to compel production by or under an Act of Parliament if the person or body is not a court established under a law of a province; or
(
b

Disclosure order
(5) If the court having jurisdiction to hear the application concludes that the disclosure of the information to which the objection was made under subsection (1) would encroach upon a specified public interest, but that the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance the specified public interest, the court may, by order, after considering both the public interest in disclosure and the form of and conditions to disclosure that are most likely to limit any encroachment upon the specified public interest resulting from disclosure, authorize the disclosure, subject to any conditions that the court considers appropriate, of all of the information, a part or summary of the information, or a written admission of facts relating to the information.
Prohibition order
(6) If the court does not authorize disclosure under subsection (4.1) or (5), the court shall, by order, prohibit disclosure of the information.
Evidence
(6.1) The court may receive into evidence anything that, in the opinion of the court, is reliable and appropriate, even if it would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law, and may base its decision on that evidence.
When determination takes effect
(7) An order of the court that authorizes disclosure does not take effect until the time provided or granted to appeal the order, or a judgment of an appeal court that confirms the order, has expired, or no further appeal from a judgment that confirms the order is available.
Introduction into evidence
(8) A person who wishes to introduce into evidence material the disclosure of which is authorized under subsection (5), but who may not be able to do so by reason of the rules of admissibility that apply before the court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, may request from the court having jurisdiction under subsection (2) or (3) an order permitting the introduction into evidence of the material in a form or subject to any conditions fixed by that court, as long as that form and those conditions comply with the order made under subsection (5).

La présente annexe ne s'applique pas aux demandes d'asile présentées par des personnes qui sont des citoyens du Canada ou des États-Unis ou qui, n'ayant pas de pays de nationalité, sont des résidents habituels du Canada ou des États-Unis. Cette annexe s'applique à l'échange, sur une base systématique ou en fonction de chaque cas, d'information concernant les demandes d'asile présentées sur le territoire de l'un ou l'autre des Participants. La présente annexe n'interdit pas l'échange d'information en fonction de chaque cas aux termes de la DEM ou de toute autre annexe de la DEM.
Article 5: Éléments d'information à échanger
Il existe quatre grandes catégories de renseignements qui peuvent être échangés:
• renseignements relatifs à l'identité du demandeur du statut de réfugié;
• renseignements relatifs au traitement de la demande d'asile;
• renseignements servant à prendre la décision de refuser à un demandeur du statut de réfugié l'accès au système de détermination du statut de réfugié, d'exclure un tel demandeur de la protection dudit système ou de mettre fin, d'annuler ou de révoquer le statut de réfugié existant d'une personne aux États-Unis ou au Canada;
• renseignements concernant la substance ou l'historique de la demande ou des demandes antérieures d'asile qui aideront à prendre une décision au sujet d'une demande d'asile ultérieure.
1. Renseignements relatifs à l'identité du demandeur du statut de réfugié
Les renseignements concernant l'identité d'un demandeur du statut de réfugié sont essentiels pour prendre une décision sur une demande d'asile. Pour être en mesure d'établir l'identité d'un demandeur du statut de réfugié, l'agent se fie aux données biographiques, descriptives ou biométriques. Il est possible que certaines des caractéristiques liées aux données sur l'identité répertoriées ci-dessous ne soient pas disponibles pour tous les demandeurs du statut de réfugié. Les renseignements sur l'identité qui peuvent être échangés aux termes de la présente annexe sont notamment les suivants:

Les renseignements sur le statut d'une demande d'asile antérieure ou en cours dans le pays d'un Participant sont utiles pour prendre une décision sur une demande d'asile présentée dans le pays de l'autre Participant. Ces renseignements font référence au traitement de la demande d'asile de la personne au Canada ou aux États-Unis et sont notamment les suivants:
o Renseignements concernant la demande d'asile, à savoir, si l'accès au système de détermination du statut de réfugié a été refusé, si une décision a été rendue ou est en instance, ou si la demande a été déclarée abandonnée ou retirée volontairement;

Ces renseignements sont utiles pour prendre la décision d'octroyer ou de refuser l'accès du demandeur du statut de réfugié au système de détermination du statut de réfugié. Ils peuvent également servir à prendre la décision d'exclure ou non une personne de la protection des réfugiés en vertu de l'article 1E ou 1F ou de refuser la protection en vertu de l'article 33(2) de la Convention de 1951, comme mis en œuvre dans les systèmes de détermination du statut de réfugié des Participants. Au Canada, ces renseignements peuvent également être utiles pour évaluer si le ministre de l'Immigration devrait participer ou non au processus de détermination du statut de réfugié en vertu du droit canadien. Les renseignements qui peuvent être échangés sont notamment les suivants:
o Renseignements liés à une décision qui précise qu'un demandeur du statut de réfugié relève ou a relevé des dispositions énoncées à l'article 1E ou 1F de la Convention de 1951 relative au statut des réfugiés, tel que mis en œuvre par le Participant;

o Renseignements concernant tout mandat en matière criminelle ou toute condamnation au criminel non exécuté relativement à un demandeur du statut de réfugié ou concernant la nature de toute infraction pénale que l'un ou l'autre des Participants a des motifs raisonnables de croire avoir été commise par le demandeur du statut de réfugié;
o Renseignements concernant des allégations en matière de sécurité liées à un demandeur du statut de réfugié ou concernant la nature de tout risque posé à la sécurité que l'un ou l'autre des Participants a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'un demandeur du statut de réfugié pourrait présenter;

4. Renseignements concernant la substance ou l'historique de la demande ou des demandes antérieures d'asile qui aideront à prendre une décision au sujet d'une demande d'asile ultérieure.
Les renseignements portant sur les demandes d'asile antérieures sont utiles pour évaluer les demandes ultérieures, notamment l'évaluation de la crédibilité. De tels renseignements sont notamment les suivants:
a.
o Pays de la dernière résidence habituelle;
o Adresse;
o Situation de famille et composition de la famille;
o Statut d'immigrant;

Article 6: Procédure d'échange d'information
b. Échange d'information en fonction de chaque cas
En plus du partage systématique de l'information, les Participants peuvent, en conformité avec les procédures exposées dans la DEM, échanger l'information décrite à l'article 5 de cette annexe concernant les demandes d'asile en fonction de chaque cas, en vertu de la demande de l'un ou l'autre des Participants.
Article 7: Confidentialité
a. Chaque Participant s'engage à ne pas divulguer à tout non-Participant, dans toute la mesure permise en vertu des lois et des règlements de son pays, tous les renseignements, demandes de renseignements et requêtes visant à obtenir des renseignements reçus des autres Participants aux termes de cette annexe.
b. La protection d'un demandeur du statut de réfugié comprend la protection de la confidentialité de l'identité d'une personne et des renseignements fournis dans le cadre de la demande d'asile de la personne, notamment le fait qu'une personne a présenté une demande d'asile. La communication non autorisée de tels renseignements peut entraîner un tort sérieux, dont la persécution et la torture, pour le demandeur du statut de réfugié ou un membre de sa famille. Par conséquent, chaque Participant s'engage à traiter comme étant confidentiels et à ne pas divulguer à tout non-Participant, dans toute la mesure permise en vertu des lois et des règlements de son pays, tous les renseignements, demandes de renseignements et requêtes visant à obtenir des renseignements reçus de l'autre Participant aux termes de cette annexe. Les Participants veilleront à ce que les renseignements ne soient pas échangés ni divulgués à un Participant ou à un non-Participant d'une manière qui pourrait poser un risque aux demandeurs du statut de réfugié ou à leurs familles dans leurs pays de nationalité ou, s'ils n'en ont pas, dans les pays où ils ont eu leur dernière résidence habituelle.
c. Les Participants reconnaissent que la permission écrite n'est pas requise, en vertu de l'article 6c)(i) de la DEM, pour divulguer des renseignements liés à la demande d'asile à d'autres organismes afin que ceux-ci poursuivent leur processus de décision ou d'examen relatif aux demandes d'asile. Par conséquent, un Participant peut, à titre d'exemple, communiquer des renseignements confidentiels à l'Executive Office for Immigration Review, aux tribunaux fédéraux des États-Unis ainsi qu'à la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié et à la Cour fédérale du Canada, relativement à ou en vue de la décision relative à une demande d'asile.
d. La divulgation par le Participant qui reçoit l'information de tout renseignement reçu aux termes de cette annexe à des gouvernements étrangers ou à des organisations internationales exige le consentement écrit du Participant qui l'a fourni.
