Dubé, J.
: This motion is for an order extending the time for the applicant to file an originating notice of motion for judicial review pursuant to s. 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act.
[2]
The decision under attack is a June 16, 1995, decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the "Commission") rejecting the complaint of the applicant alleging discrimination in employment on the grounds of family status and age. The notice of motion for the extension of time was filed on October 25, 1995, or more than four months after the decision in question. An application under s. 18.1(2) for judicial review must be made within 30 days or within such further time as this court may allow.
[3]
Under rule 1614 of the
Federal Court Rules
, a judge may extend the time limits for the filing of a judicial review. However, to obtain an extension the applicant must first, justify the entire delay; second, establish that his application has a reasonable chance of success (an arguable case).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  writing under rule 324. However, there are no written representations on the part of the applicant. The only document in support of her motion is her own affidavit.
[5]
In her affidavit the applicant states that she was permanently dismissed from her position at Canadian Forces Europe on June 30, 1991. Her complaint alleges that she was discriminated against because of her family status (single) and age (23) "as a result of the respondent's policy which gives preference for civilian employment to persons under age 21, or who are dependants of military personnel at its military facility in Lahr, Germany". It was recommended that her complaint be stood down pending the Commission's decision on another complaint. In a letter dated June 16, 1995, she received the decision referred to above. On July 1, 1995, she wrote the Commission expressing her dissatisfaction. The first indication given to her that there was an appeal process available was in a telephone conversation with one Rod Young, Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator. By that time, the date limit had passed.
[6]
The grounds for review, as stated in the notice of motion, are that the applicant had, at all material times, an intention to seek judicial review and made that intention known to the respondent; that, to the knowledge of the rspondents, she had gone through the Access to Information process, and that the case raised by the applicant is meritorious. However, there is no affidavit evidence in support of any of these grounds.
[7]
On the other hand the respondent, the Department of National Defence, filed the affidavit of Randall C. Smith, legal officer with the Directorate of Law/Human Rights and Information, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Canadian Forces. He avers that on December 20, 1995, he spoke with the Director, Human Rights and Anti-Harassment Coordination 2, who is responsible for the administration of all Canadian Human Rights Act complaints against the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence. The Director reviewed his files and informed him that neither he nor his staff had knowledge that the applicant had an alleged intention to seek judicial review until November 28, 1995, when the notice of motion was faxed to them. On December 21, 1995, he was informed by the Deputy Access to Information/Privacy Coordinator, Department of National Defence, that within the last two years the applicant has not filed an Access to Information or Privacy Act request with the Department of National Defence.
[8]
The applicant has filed no reply to the affidavit and the written submissions of the Commission and the Department of National Defence.
[9]
Again, to succeed on an application for time extension, the applicant must demonstrate that a reasonable explanation for the delay exists. She must show some justification for the delay throughout the whole period of the delay.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). Clearly, in the case at bar, the applicant has failed to satisfactorily account for the delay throughout the whole period. The assertions on the face of the notice of motion are not supported by way of affidavit. On the contrary, they have been denied by the affidavit of the respondent and no reply has been filed.
[10]
Consequently, it is not necessary to consider whether or not the applicant has an arguable case. However, it is worthy of note that the applicant has filed no representations to show an arguable case. Thus, this application for an extension of time cannot be granted.
[11]
Therefore, the application is denied.
Application dismissed.
