Wetston, J.
: The applicants AB Hassle and Astra Pharma seek an order compelling the respondent Apotex Inc. to file and serve a detailed statement of the legal and factual basis for the allegations made in its Notice of Allegation dated April 27, 1993. This is required under s. 5(3)(a) of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, SOR/93-133 (hereinafter "
Regulations
"). Specifically, they seek the following further information in respect of Omeprazole capsules (20mg and 40mg) for which Apotex is seeking a Notice of Compliance:
(a) the ingredients, formulation and composition of Omeprazole capsules,
(b) the process proposed to be used to make the Omeprazole,
(c) the process proposed to be used to make the Omeprazole capsules,
(d) the commercial packaging and instructions for use of the Omeprazole capsules,
(e) the therapeutic uses in respect of which the Omeprazole capsules will be marketed and sold.
Background Facts
[2]
The applicant AB Hassle ("Hassle") is the owner of the Canadian patent nos. 1,127,158, 1,129,417, 1,264,751, 1,292,693, 1,302,891 and 1,234,118 all of which concern the medicine omeprazole. The applicant Astra Pharma Inc. ("Astra") is a licensee of Hassle under the patents and is entitled to sell omeprazole capsules in Canada with the consent of Hassle. Under s. 4(1) of the
Regulations
, Astra filed two patent lists dated April 18, 1993, with respect to omeprazole capsules. Each patent list referred to the six patents.
[3]
On April 27, 1993, Apotex submitted a Notice of Allegation under s. 5(3)(b) of the
Regulations
, alleging that no claim for the medicine or its use would be infringed by Apotex making, constructing, using or selling capsules of omeprazole. Shortly thereafter on July 14, 1993, Hassle filed an Originating Notice of Motion pursuant to s. 6(1) of the
Regulations
for an order prohibiting the Minister of National Health and Welfare from issuing a notice of compliance to Apotex with respect to the medicine omeprazole until the expiry of all six patents.
[4]
On June 29, 1993, Justice Dubé ordered Apotex to file and serve a detailed statement of the legal and factual basis for the allegations asserted in their Notice of Allegation as required by s. 5(3)(a) of the
Regulations
. A protective order was also issued on consent of the parties. Madame Justice Reed issued a further order on September 27, 1993, requiring Apotex to comply with the order of Justice Dubé by filing a detailed statement by October 4, 1993. A s. 5(3)(a) statement was served and filed by Apotex pursuant to this order. However, the applicants took the position that this statement was simply a bald assertion that the intended product compositions did not infringe the patents. A motion was brought before the Associate Chief Justice and Apotex was ordered to file a further detailed statement on November 22, 1993. Pursuant to this order a further statement was served and filed by Apotex on December 7, 1993.
[5]
The applicants, still unsatisfied with the information provided on December 7, 1993, brought a further notice of motion to compel Apotex to file a further detailed statement. This motion was brought before Madame Justice McGillis (1994), 81 F.T.R. 17 (T.D.) wherein she dealt with the legal and evidential burden in s. 6(2) of the
Regulations
and made the following finding at p. 21 of her reasons:
"I have carefully considered the very capable submissions of counsel for the parties and have concluded, as did Nadon, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the
Regulations
rests on the patentee. However, in my opinion, the wording of s. 6(2) of the
Regulations
imposes an evidential burden on the generic company. In the event that the generic company fails to satisfy its burden of adducing sufficient evidence to justify its allegations, the patentee will have little difficulty meeting its overall legal burden in the proceedings.
"In light of my finding that the generic company has the burden of adducing evidence to justify its allegations, the rationale advanced by the applicants in support of the applications for particulars would appear to no longer exist. However, in the event that the applicants determine following a consideration of these reasons that Apotex has not sufficiently complied with its obligation under s. 5(3)(a) of the
Regulations
, counsel for both parties agreed before me that a further application may be brought by the applicants seeking the same relief outlined in the Notice of Motion which was before me today."
In disposing of this motion, McGillis, J., did not deal with the contents of the detailed statement.
Present Motion
[6]
The applicants continue to seek a more detailed statement from Apotex and, in particular, they argue that the contents of the detailed statement must be examined in the context of the decision of McGillis, J., that the patent holder bears the overall legal burden. The applicants maintain that the detailed statement is the only mechanism by which to obtain the basis for the allegations in the Notice of Allegation. They contend that since the legal burden lies on the patentee to prove that the allegations are not justified, it is imperative that the statement provide sufficient information to ascertain whether the proposed formulations infringe the patent at issue. It was further contended that the detailed statement must be sufficiently detailed for the purposes of preparing any affidavits.
[7]
Generally, the
Regulations
are intended to prevent infringement. The Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 329 held that the proceedings launched by a patent holder under s. 6(1) of the
Regulations
for an order prohibiting the Minister from issuing a notice of compliance are in the nature of judicial review and are subject to Part V.I of the
Federal Court Rules
.
[8]
Counsel for the applicants is particularly concerned about the onus which was held to lie with the patentee in a s. 6(1) application. The applicants contend that, in order to meet the onus that none of the allegations are justified, a further and better statement than that filed on December 7, 1993, is required. The Federal Court of Appeal has recently considered the onus question in a s. 6(1) application in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) There Hugessen, J.A., commented at p. 359:
"As I understand the scheme of the regulations, it is the party moving under s. 6, in this case Merck, which, as the initiator of the proceedings, has the carriage of the litigation and bears the initial burden of proof. That burden, as it seems to me, is a difficult one since it must be to disprove some or all of the allegations in the notice of allegation, which, if left unchallenged, would allow the Minister to issue a notice of compliance. There may, of course, be some presumptions (such as for example the statutory presumption of validity of a patent) (
Patent Act
, supra, s. 43.) which may help the moving party and have the effect of displacing the burden of proof. The presumption enacted by s. 55.1 however, is not one of them.
The proceedings are not an action and their object is solely to prohibit the issuance of a notice of compliance under the
Food and Drug Regulations
. Manifestly, they do not constitute 'an action for infringement of a patent'
(See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.)
"Furthermore, since the Regulations clearly allow the Minister, absent a timely application under s. 6, to issue a notice of compliance on the basis of the allegations in the notice of allegation, it would seem that on the hearing of such an application, at least where the notice has alleged non-infringement, the court should start from the proposition that the allegations of fact in the notice of allegation are true except to the extent that the contrary has been shown by the applicant. In determining whether or not the allegations are 'justified' (subsection 6(2)) the court must then decide whether, on the basis of such facts as have been assumed or proven, the allegations would give rise in law to the conclusion that the patent would not be infringed by the respondent." (own emphasis)
[9]
Hugessen, J.A., also commented on the effect of the characterization of the proceedings as an application rather than as a patent infringement action at pp. 359-360:
"As a further consequence of the application under s. 6 not being an ordinary action for infringement, there is no opportunity for either party to have recourse to discovery, whether oral or documentary. Where either party files affidavits there is, of course, opportunity for the opposite party to cross-examine thereon, but since there is no requirement that the notice of allegation be in affidavit form, and no obligation on the respondent to produce any affidavits at all, (rule 1603(2) permits but does not require such affidavits.) the applicant cannot expect to be able to make his case out the mouth of the respondent. Even where there is an opportunity to cross-examine, such cross-examination is far more limited in scope than examination for discovery and, apart from questions going to the witness' credibility, is limited to relevant matters arising from the affidavit itself."
[10]
When an Originating Notice of Motion is filed pursuant to s. 6(1), the detailed statement may form part of the application record upon which the application for a prohibition order will be heard. The detailed statement is intended to set out the issues to be met by the applicant. On the basis of this document, the applicant must prepare its affidavit evidence. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Mahoney, J.A., states as follows with respect to the purpose of the detailed statement at p. 337 [C.P.R.]:
"One further matter warrants comment. Section 5(3)(a) of the
Regulations
requires that the applicant for the NOC provide a detailed statement of the basis in fact and law for his statement of allegation. It seems intended that the patentee be fully aware of the grounds on which the applicant says issuance of a NOC will not lead to an infringement of the patent before the patentee decides whether or not to apply to a court for a determination. Such disclosure would define the issues at a very early stage. If that is the purpose, it confirms the intention that the proceedings be expeditiously conducted."
[11]
The detailed statement of fact and law satisfies a regulatory requirement which may form part of the application record depending upon whether the patent holder decides to file an application under s. 6(1) of the
Regulations
. In
Merck Frosst Canada
, supra, the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized that the proceeding under s. 6(1) is not an action, accordingly, the detailed statement is not, strictly speaking, a pleading. The statement required by s. 5(3)(a) is initially intended to provide the patent holder with sufficient information to assess whether or not to file an application under s. 6(1). Once an Originating Notice of Motion is filed the detailed statement serves the further purpose of framing the issues to be decided in the context of the application for the prohibition order against the Minister. However, a patent holder cannot, by filing under s. 6(1), convert the proceedings into a patent infringement action and consequently, the full benefits of discovery which would be afforded in an infringement action are not available. Given that the detailed statement satisfies a regulatory requirement and that the
Regulations
provide no guidance as to the nature or extent of the information required in the statement, the court is being requested, on a case by case basis, to determine what constitutes a sufficiently detailed statement. Without further guidance in the regulations, it can only be said that the extent of information required will depend in large part upon the legal grounds advanced in the statement.
[12]
The applicants have an overall burden to demonstrate that the allegations contained in the Notice of Allegation are not justified. Nadon, J., has also held that the patent holder has the responsibility of seeking the assistance of the court in obtaining further information if the statement filed pursuant to s. 5(3)(a) proves unsatisfactory;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 34. However, it must also be borne in mind that it is the patentee who has carriage of the litigation and who also has the most to gain from dilatory prosecution; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at p. 337 [C.P.R.]. Accordingly, an application to obtain a further detailed statement must be supported by some evidence to demonstrate the merits of the application. It is not sufficient to simply argue that the detailed statement is deficient unless it is the type of statement considered by Nadon, J., in
Eli  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The evidence in support must, of necessity, be in affidavit form. This statement is not of the type at issue in
Eli  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[13]
There was considerable argument by the respondent that the detailed statement was sufficient to satisfy the regulatory requirements. However, given the lack of evidence before the court, I am unable to determine the sufficiency of the information contained in the detailed statement.
[14]
Accordingly, the motion is dismissed.
Motion dismissed.
