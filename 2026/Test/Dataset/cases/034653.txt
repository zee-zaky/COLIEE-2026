Richard, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review seeking to have a decision made by Pierre Baillie, the chairman of an appeal committee established under s. 31 of the
Public Service Employment Act
, [see footnote 1] on June 17, 1993, set aside. The chairman of the appeal board allowed the appeal by the respondent, in respect of whom a recommendation that he be released had been made to the Public Service Commission, under s. 31 of the
Public Service Employment Act
, by his superiors, who had come to the conclusion that he would be incapable of properly performing the duties of the position he occupied.
Facts
[2]
The facts out of which this dispute arose are as follows. The respondent holds a store services position (GS-STS-04) in the Operations Division of the 202 Warehouse Depot in Montreal, Quebec, a division that is part of the Department of National Defence. The respondent has been employed by that Department since January 15, 1974.
[3]
From January 15, 1991, to March 18, 1991, the respondent was absent from work because of back pain, a symptom of a deviation of the spinal column which was diagnosed by a physician. After examining the respondent, Dr. George Murray, a specialist in orthopaedics, diagnosed a personal congenital dorso-lumbar condition. This diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by another orthopaedist, Dr. André Gilbert, on August 23, 1991.
[4]
On November 3, 1992, Dr. Germain Vigneault (of Health and Welfare Canada) concluded that the respondent could no longer safely perform the duties of his work. This conclusion was also confirmed by Dr. Marc Goulet on January 22, 1993. Dr. Goulet then recommended that the respondent be assigned to work that would take the following functional limitations into account:
[Translation] "- Avoid repetitive movements involving flexing and extending the lumbo-sacral rachis.
- Avoid frequent lifting of weights over 20 to 25 pounds."
[5]
The chairman of the board found that the Department of National Defence had installed counters at an appropriate height to make the store services employees' work easier.
[6]
It also appears that efforts were made at the Department of National Defence in March and June 1992 to examine the possibility of reassigning the appellant. However, those efforts did not produce any results.
[7]
In response to the recommendation to the Public Service Commission by Major-General R.N. Fisher that the appellant be released under s. 31 of the
Public Service Employment Act
, the respondent exercised his right of appeal under subs. (2) of s. 31. [see footnote 2]
[8]
On June 17, 1993, the chairman of the appeal board found that the respondent was incapable of performing the duties of the position he occupied. The chairman of the appeal board also decided that the Minister's decision was premature. It is that decision that is the subject of this application for judicial review. The chairman cited
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Muldoon. It is important to point out that since the chairman of the appeal board made his decision on June 17, 1993, that decision has been reversed by the Federal Court of Appeal.
[9]
The appeal board clearly found that the respondent was incapable of performing the duties of the position he occupied. The chairman of the appeal board stated:
[Translation] "It seems apparent, according to the medical report submitted by the Department, which was not contradicted before me, that the appellant Racicot has become incapable of performing the duties of the position he occupies as those duties are to be performed at present. From the medical standpoint, it is therefore totally contraindicated for him to be able to continue performing the duties of his employment as they now stand."
[10]
The chairman of the board criticized the employer for refusing to retain the services of an occupational therapist and give him access in the workplace. According to the applicant, the employer had no duty, in the case of a congenital illness or pre-existing personal condition. to retain the services of a specialist in occupational therapy.
[11]
According to the applicant, the decision of the deputy head to recommend that the respondent be released was justified, reasonable and bona fide. The appeal board was not entitled to apply the
Canadian Human Rights Act
[see footnote 4] as it did, and on this point he cited the comments of Robertson, J.A., of the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . [see footnote 5]
Issues Raised By The Applicant
The Principal Questions
[12]
(1) Did the board err in law and exceed its jurisdiction by applying the provisions of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
in this case, particularly since the board acknowledged that the respondent had become incapable of performing the duties of the position he occupied?
(2) Did the board err in law and decline to exercise its jurisdiction by not dismissing the respondent's appeal once it had found that the respondent was incapable of performing the duties of the position he occupied?
The Secondary Questions
[13]
(3) Did the board err in law by finding that the employer had discriminated against the respondent in making the recommendation that he be released?
(4) Did the board err in law by imposing a duty of accommodation on the employer and by deciding that the employer had failed in that duty?
(5) If there was direct discrimination, did the board apply the concept of bona fide occupational requirement correctly?
Decision
[14]
I believe that this matter may be disposed of by answering the first question in issue in the affirmative. First, what should really be asked is whether the appeal board had the authority to apply the
Canadian Human Rights Act
as it did in this case. On this point, I adopt the comments of Robertson, J.A, of the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . [see footnote 6] Robertson, J.A., clearly decided that an appeal board established under the
Public Service Employment Act
was a tribunal whose jurisdiction was limited to the jurisdiction conferred on it by Parliament. He stated: [see footnote 7]
"The Appeal Board, like all tribunals, is a statutory body with no inherent jurisdiction. It may decide a matter only if Parliament has expressly or impliedly conferred on it power over the parties, the subject-matter and the remedy. This general principle was clearly articulated by La Forest, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 14:
'It is essential to appreciate that s. 52(1) does not function as an independent source of an administrative tribunal's jurisdiction to address constitutional issues. Section 52(1) affirms in explicit language the supremacy of the Constitution but is silent on the jurisdictional point per se. In other words, s. 52(1) does not specify which bodies may consider and rule on
Charter
questions, and cannot be said to confer jurisdiction on an administrative tribunal.
Rather, jurisdiction must have expressly or impliedly been conferred on the tribunal by its enabling statute or otherwise. This fundamental principle holds true regardless of the nature of the issue before the administrative body
.'" (emphasis is mine) (emphasis is added by Mr. Justice Robertson)
[15]
Later, [see footnote 8] observing that there was no section in the
Public Service Employment Act
that empowered an appeal board to apply the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, Mr. Justice Robertson stated:
"I was not directed to any provision in the
PSEA
which impliedly confers jurisdiction on the Appeal Board to apply the
CHRA
. The legislation before us contrasts sharply with that considered in
Cuddy  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , which expressly empowered the Labour Relations Board to decide questions of law and to determine questions of law and fact relating to its own jurisdiction."
[16]
Mr. Justice Robertson then cited the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appeal board under the
Public Service Employment Act
had no jurisdiction to decide whether a department had complied with the provisions of the 1988
Official Languages Act
, and accordingly had no authority to apply that
Act
. Mr. Justice Décary stated: [see footnote 10]
"Unless the
Act
itself contains some indication that Parliament intended to give an appeal board a new jurisdiction affecting the department's managerial rights, the appeal board will have to resign itself to continuing to perform the function it has until now exercised, and to leave to other jurisdictions the responsibility for deciding whether a department has complied with the provisions of the 1988
Official Languages Act
."
[17]
We should also refer to the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that the person who made the recommendation for release or demotion had to act honestly, and based on an observation made in good faith. Chief Justice Jackett stated:
"In the absence of arbitrary standards laid down by law, competence or incompetence is not something that can, or must, be determined, as a matter of law, by application of a rule. Whether or not a person is competent or incompetent for a post is a matter of opinion, and, in the absence of any special legal direction, all that the law can imply with regard thereto is that it must be honestly formed, and that it must, in the first instance at least, be based upon the observation, by those under whom he works, of the manner in which the person whose competence is in question carries out his duties. In particular circumstances, rough and ready rules of thumb may be adopted by such persons as an aid to the formation of the required opinion; but, in my view, in the absence of
(a) some failure to apply properly some specific statutory or other legal direction, or
(b) proof of bad faith on the part of those whose observations and judgment are in question,
a board of review established under s. 31 would not be justified in deciding that a deputy head's recommendation should not be acted upon unless it had before it material that satisfied it, as a matter of fact, that the deputy head was wrong in forming the opinion that the person in question was 'incompetent in performing the duties of the position he occupies.'"
[18]
It was also argued in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to apply the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. The argument went as follows. It was argued that the expression used by Chief Justice Jackett in the original English version, "or other legal direction", implied the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and the interpretation of that
Act
. Mr. Justice Robertson responded to that argument as follows: [see footnote 12]
"It is argued that the
CHRA
and its judicial interpretation constitute 'legal directions' which the Appeal Board must apply in order to fulfil its statutory mandate under s. 31. With respect, I do not think that the reasoning of this court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, extends the jurisdiction of the Appeal Board beyond its legislated mandate. The 'legal directions' to which <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> refers correspond to simple rules of general application. For example, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), this court imposed a duty on employers to give sufficient notice of unsatisfactory performance to employees before recommending release. Similarly, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), it was held that an employer, which had implemented an employee counselling programme, is obligated to refer an employee to counselling services at the employee's request before he or she is released. These rules are conditions precedent which must be satisfied before the deputy head recommends an employee's release. They are true 'legal directions' which the Appeal Board is required to apply to discharge its mandate under s. 31 of the
PSEA
.
"Interpretation and application of the
CHRA
is, by contrast, intricate. It does not lend itself to creating simple 'legal directions' except, of course, those by which the deputy head is bound. For example, the deputy head is charged not to discriminate against an employee when making a recommendation to the Appeal Board. However, the determination of whether a certain practice constitutes direct or indirect discrimination is not a 'legal direction'. The divergent opinions of this court and the Supreme Court, regarding the definition and effects of direct and indirect discrimination, underlines the complexity and elusiveness of those concepts."
[19]
In the case before us, there is no evidence on which we could doubt the bona fides of the respondent's supervisors or of Major-General R.N. Fisher, the deputy head who made the recommendation to the Public Service Commission that the respondent be released because of incapacity. The supervisors observed the manner in which the respondent was performing his duties and determined that he was incapable as a result of an illness that was personal to him, and this medical diagnosis was confirmed by a number of expert physicians skilled in this field.
[20]
In view of the fact that the chairman of the appeal board erred in law and consequently answered the first question in issue in the affirmative, it is not necessary to deal at length with the questions of the nature of the discrimination allegedly suffered by the respondent, or the question of the duty of accommodation or the concept of bona fide occupational requirement, as they have become purely academic.
[21]
However, I would like to note that I have read the opinion of Madam Justice Desjardins in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . She decided that s. 31 of the
Public Service Employment Act
is a case of direct discrimination. However, as Madam Justice Desjardins concluded, that section itself contains a bona fide occupational requirement which is consistent with s. 15(a) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. [see footnote 13]
[22]
Accordingly, the decision of the chairman of the appeal board, Pierre Baillie, dated June 17, 1993, is set aside and the matter is referred back to an appeal board established under s. 31 of the
Public Service Employment Act
to be decided on the basis of the record, having regard to the reasons stated in this decision.
Application allowed.
