1. Introduction
[1]
Blanchard, J.
: This is an appeal by Tradition Fine Foods Ltd. (the Applicant) under s. 56 of the
Trademarks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13 (the
Act
), challenging the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board (the Board) dated December 16, 2004. The Board rejected the Applicant's opposition to the registration by Groupe Tradition'l Inc. (the Respondent) of the trademark application for BAGEL TRADITION'L ET DESSIN.
2. Background Facts
[2]
The Applicant is a corporation registered under the laws of Ontario; it began operation in 1983. Since its inception, the Applicant has manufactured and sold a range of frozen bakery products, namely, muffin, cake and cookie batters, croissants, danishes and other pastries. In 1990, the Applicant began selling fresh baked goods as well. The Applicant's wares are sold in association with the trademark TRADITION to various food distributors, who in turn sell the products to retail outlets such as grocery stores, convenience stores, donut and muffin shops, and restaurants. The Applicant also sells its products to institutional purchasers such as hotels.
[3]
The Applicant owns several trademarks in Canada which include the word TRADITION for use in association with baked goods. The Applicant obtained certificates of registration for the following trademarks:
"(a) TRADITION
to be used in association with frozen bakery products, namely muffin, cake and cookie batters, croissants, danishes and other pastries. Certificate of registration No. TMA406,696 received January 8, 1993.
"(b)
[Diagram Omitted - See Printed Version]
to be used in association with frozen bakery products, namely cake and muffin batters. Certificate of registration No. TMA409,680 received on March 19, 1993. The right to the exclusive use of the word 'Bake' is disclaimed apart from the trademark.
"(c) TRADITION
to be used in association with baked goods, namely muffins, croissants, cookies, cakes and pastries. Certificate of registration No. TMA487,365 received December 22, 1997.
"(d)
[Diagram Omitted - See Printed Version]
to be used in association with muffin batter and baked muffins, and with cookies. Certificate of registration No. TMA503,636 received on November 4, 1998. The right to the exclusive use of a representation of a muffin, in the case of goods designated as muffin batter and baked muffins is disclaimed apart from the trademark."
[4]
The Applicant has also used the tradename, TRADITION FINE FOODS, to identify its business since 1983. This tradename is used on all packaging for products sold in association with the trademark TRADITION.
[5]
The Respondent has been in operation since 1989. The Respondent, and its predecessors, principally produces a variety of bagels that are sold fresh or frozen, and packaged or in bulk.The Respondent also produces and sells pizza-bagels and cream cheese. The Respondent produces and sells its wares through its fabrique-restaurant in Sillery, Quebec.
[6]
On May 13, 1997, the corporate predecessor of the Respondent, 3102-6636 Québec Inc., applied to register the trademark at issue in this appeal. The application No. 844,912 is a proposed use registration; the proposed trademark is intended to be used in association with baked goods such as bagels, pizza bagels, dough and pastry as well as other food products (i.e. cream cheese), and in association with the operation of restaurants and related services (i.e. the preparation of take-out goods and catering services). The Respondent's proposed trademark appears as follows:
[Diagram Omitted - See Printed Version]
In its application, the Respondent has disclaimed exclusive use of the word "Bagel" apart from the trademark.
[7]
The Respondent already owns two trademarks using the words BAGEL TRADITION'L:
"(a)
[Diagram Omitted - See Printed Version]
to be used in association with the following bakery products: bagels, pizza-bagels, pastries and other products such as cream cheese. Certificate of registration No. TMA497,624 received July 22, 1998. The right to exclusive use of the words 'Bagel' and 'Café' is disclaimed apart from the trademark.
"(b) BAGEL TRADITION'L
to be used in association with the following bakery products: bagels, pizza-bagels, pastries and other products such as cream cheese. Certificate of registration No. TMA497,625 received July 22, 1998. The right to exclusive use of the word 'Bagel' is disclaimed apart from the trademark."
[8]
On January 28, 1998, after finding there to be doubt as to whether the trademark claimed by the Respondent was registrable, the Registrar of Trademarks published the Respondent's application in the
Trademarks Journal
, pursuant to s. 37(3) of the
Act
, to allow potential interested parties the opportunity to oppose the application.
[9]
The Applicant filed a statement opposing registration of the Respondent's trademark on May 14, 1998. Pursuant to s. 38(2) of the
Act
, the Applicant specified the following as its grounds of objection:
(1) that the Respondent's trademark is not registrable under paragraph 12(1)(d) of the
Act
because it is confusing with the Applicant's trademarks;
(2) that the Respondent is not a person entitled to the registration of its trademark under s. 16(3) of the
Act
because the trademark is confusing with the Applicant's trademarks; and
(3) that the Respondent's trademark is not distinctive of the Respondent's wares and services as required by s. 2 of the
Act
.
The Applicant also claimed that the Respondent could not register its proposed trademark because it did not satisfy the exigencies of paragraph 30(I) of the
Act
, which required the Respondent to provide a statement with its application for registration that the Respondent is entitled to use the trademark in Canada in association with the wares described in its application. This ground of opposition was later abandoned by the Applicant.
[10]
The Respondent filed a counter-statement on October 22, 1998, denying the Applicant's grounds of opposition. In particular, the Respondent emphasized that it is the owner of similar trademarks using the words, BAGEL TRADITION'L, and that it has used these words since May 1989 in association with bakery products. The respondent also claimed use of the tradenames Bagel Tradition'l and Bagel Tradition'l Café.
[11]
On December 16, 2004, the Registrar of Trademarks, sitting as the Board, rejected the Applicant's opposition. The Board held that the Respondent had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the Applicant's trademarks and the Respondent's proposed trademark. Moreover, the Board held that the Applicant had not established that the Respondent's trademark is not distinctive.
3. Applicable Law
[12]
In its opposition, the Applicant essentially focuses on two grounds: confusion and distinctiveness. Below, I will outline the provisions of the
Act
relevant to these grounds of opposition, as well as highlight the relevant jurisprudence. The text of the pertinent statutory provisions is attached to these reasons as Schedule "A".
A. Confusion
[13]
Paragraph 12(1)(d) of the
Act
provides that a trademark is not registrable if it is confusing with an already registered trademark. Similarly, paragraph 16(3)(c) prohibits registration of a proposed use trademark that is confusing with an unregistered trademark, if the latter has previously been used in Canada or in respect of which an application for registration has been made.
[14]
Section 2 of the
Act
defines "confusing"; however, it is s. 6 which sets out the criteria governing confusion between marks. Specifically, s. 6(2) states that confusion arises if a prospective purchaser would likely be led to the mistaken inference that the wares or services associated with the respective trademarks are manufactured or performed by the same person. This provision applies only where trademarks are used or intended to be used in the same area. In determining whether trademarks are confusing, the Board must consider the five factors set out in s. 6(5) of the
Act
, namely:
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trademark has been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.
This list is non-exhaustive; the Board must also take into account any other factor relevant to "all the surrounding circumstances": see
Mattel Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc. et al.
(2006), 348 N.R. 340; 2006 SCC 22, at paragraph 54, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Moreover, as the assessment is context-specific, each factor considered may be given a different weight. While evidence of actual confusion is a relevant consideration, it is not necessary even where trademarks have operated in the same market area for a long time. However, an adverse inference may be drawn from a lack of such evidence in circumstances where evidence of concurrent use is extensive: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[15]
The material date for determining confusion differs depending on which section of the
Act
is invoked. Under paragraph 12(1)(d), the material date is that of the Board's decision: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 413 (F.C.A.), at page 422  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The material date for determining confusion under s. 16(3), as stated in that provision, is the date of the filing of the application for registration.
[16]
With respect to the burden of proof, the initial onus is on the party opposing registration to establish that it had used its trademark prior to the material date. Once the opponent has done so, the onus then shifts to the person applying to register the trademark to show on a balance of probabilities that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). If there is any doubt as to whether the party applying to register a trademark has satisfied the requirement of "no reasonable likelihood of confusion", then the Board must refuse the application: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at paragraph 9, Justice Robert Décary stated the following:
"To decide whether the use of a trade mark or of a trade name causes confusion with another trade mark or another trade name, the court must ask itself whether, as a matter of first impression on the minds of an ordinary person having a vague recollection of that other mark or name, the use of both marks or names in the same area in the same manner is likely to lead to the inference that the service associated with those marks or names are performed by the same person, whether or not the services are of the same general class." (Citations omitted)
[18]
This principle was recently affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 56.
"What, then, is the perspective from which the likelihood of a 'mistaken inference' is to be measured? It is not that of the careful and diligent purchaser. Nor, on the other hand, is it the 'moron in a hurry' so beloved by elements of the passing-off bar:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ch. D.), at p. 117. It is rather a mystical consumer who stands somewhere in between, dubbed in a 1927 Ontario decision of Meredith, C.J., as the 'ordinary hurried purchasers':
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Sup. Ct.), at p. 13. See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M.O.B.), the Registrar stated at p. 538:
'When assessing the issue of confusion, the trademarks at issue must be considered from the point of view of the average hurried consumer having an imperfect recollection of the opponent's mark who might encounter the trademark of the applicant in association with the applicant's wares in the market-place.'"
[19]
Moreover, in determining whether trademarks are confusing, the Board (and the Court) must examine the trademarks in their totality, as Justice Alice Desjardins stated in
Park Avenue Furniture
, above at page 426  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
"I agree with the appellant that marks are to be considered in their entirety. On this very point, H.G. Fox says the following:
'In applying these tests the first principle to be invoked is that the marks are to be looked at as totalities and not as dissected items. The idea of each mark, that is, the net impression left by the mark as a whole upon the mind is to be considered. It is the mark taken in its entirety that is to be examined and a decision then arrived at whether such mark is likely to cause confusion with one already registered ... The true test is whether the totality of the mark proposed to be registered is such that it is likely to cause mistake or deception or confusion in the minds of persons accustomed to the existing trademark. It is the combination of the marks as a whole that is to be regarded and the effect or idea of the whole that is to be compared.'"
B. Descriptiveness
[20]
A trademark that is "clearly descriptive" or "misdescriptive" cannot be registered pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(b). In order for a mark to be deemed as "clearly descriptive", it must be more than merely suggestive of the character or quality of the wares of services in association with which it is used or proposed to be used. Rather, as Justice Danielle Tremblay-Lamer stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the descriptive character must go to "the material composition or intrinsic quality" of the goods or services or refer to "an obvious intrinsic quality" of the goods or services which are the subject of the trade mark, such as a feature, trait or characteristic belonging to the product itself. Justice Tremblay-Lamer continued by stating at paragraph 71 that it is a matter of first impression.
"The test for determining whether a trademark infringes paragraph 12(1)(b) is the immediate or first impression formed. The determination must not be based on research into or critical analysis of the meaning of the words (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The impression must also be assessed from the perspective of the ordinary, everyday purchaser or user of the wares or services (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 481 (F.C.), at paragraph 24.
C. Distinctiveness
[21]
A mark which is "clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive" of the wares or services and consequently not registrable under s. 12(1)(b) may still be registrable if the mark is "distinctive" pursuant to s. 12(2). Section 2 of the
Act
defines "distinctive" as a trademark which either (a) actually distinguishes the wares in association with which the trademark is used from other wares, or (b) is adopted to so distinguish between the wares.
[22]
Justice Barry Strayer in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  falls on the party applying to register the trademark, and that the onus was a heavy one:
"... There are various authorities to the effect that where one must prove that a normally descriptive word has acquired a secondary meaning so as to make it descriptive of a particular product, the onus is indeed heavy: [citations omitted]. ... The onus, as I noted above, is on the applicant for registration of such a mark to demonstrate clearly that it has become so distinctive of his product that it has acquired a secondary meaning which would not, vis à vis the relevant public, normally be confused with the primary meaning of the word."
4. Evidence before the Board
[23]
Both parties provided the Board affidavits with attached exhibits. Additionally, the parties submitted written arguments and made oral submissions at a hearing convened by the Board.
[24]
In support of its opposition, the Applicant tendered the affidavit of Peter Glowczewski, the founder and president of Tradition Fine Foods. Mr. Glowczewski attests in his affidavit, sworn on August 27, 1999, to the history of the Applicant's business and to the Applicant's registered trademarks, which include the word TRADITION. Moreover, Mr. Glowczewski attests to the sales figures associated with TRADITION products, and to the packaging and promotion of those products. Attached to his affidavit are numerous exhibits showing the use of the Applicant's trademarks on the packaging of its products and its promotional efforts; the examples in these exhibits are not dated.
[25]
On cross-examination, Mr. Glowczewski acknowledges that the Applicant did not begin bagel sales until October 1995, and that the Applicant's bagels did not bear the Applicant's trademarks. Rather, the bagels were sold exclusively to hotel chains in boxes bearing the Applicant's tradename. As well, Mr. Glowczewski admits that the Applicant never sold pizza bagels or cream cheese, nor had it offered restaurant or catering services.
[26]
The Respondent submitted three affidavits as evidence. The affidavits were those of François Joyet, Johanne Clouet and Doris Dion.
[27]
Mr. Joyet, president of Groupe Tradition'l Inc., attests to the history and business activities of the Respondent. Mr. Joyet provides evidence regarding the company's use and registration of the BAGEL TRADITION'L trademarks in Canada. Mr. Joyet also attests to the total sales between 1989 and 1999 under the trademark BAGEL TRADITION'L, as well as the amount of monies spent by the Respondent for marketing and promotions during that same time period. Attached to Mr. Joyet's affidavit are numerous exhibits showing the use of the Respondent's trademark; however, the examples in these exhibits are not dated. Finally, Mr. Joyet deposes that he does not know of any occurrences of confusion between the Respondent's trademarks containing the words BAGEL TRADITION'L and the Applicant's trademarks.
[28]
On cross-examination, Mr. Joyet clarified the dates relevant to the exhibits attached to his affidavit.
[29]
Ms. Clouet, a legal assistant with McCarthy Tétrault (the trademark agent for the Respondent), attests to having purchased products with the word "tradition" on their labels at several grocery stores in Quebec. Attached to Ms. Clouet's affidavit are 15 exhibits, which contain either labels of products featuring the word "tradition" or receipts of her purchases of those products. Ms. Clouet was not cross-examined on her affidavit.
[30]
In her affidavit, Ms. Dion, an employee with McCarthy Tétrault, attests to searching for trademarks through the Internet site of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and finding 188 documents with the word, "tradition". Her findings are attached as exhibits. Of those 188 trademarks, Ms. Dion states that 67 are in relation to food products. Ms. Dion was not cross-examined on her affidavit.
[31]
In reply, the Applicant submitted an affidavit sworn by Patricia MacFarlane. Ms. MacFarlane's affidavit is not before the Court.
5. Board's Decision
[32]
In its decision dated December 16, 2004, the Board dismissed the Applicant's opposition on all grounds alleged. The Board's decision is reported as
Tradition Fine Foods Ltd. v. 3102-6636 Québec Inc.
(2004), 46 C.P.R.(4th) 185.
[33]
The Board reviewed the evidence adduced by the parties in its reasons. With respect to Mr. Glowczewski's affidavit, the Board noted that despite the "abundance of documentary evidence" there was very little information about the periods during which the packaging samples attached as exhibits were used. The Board stated that it had to rely on the cross-examination of Mr. Glowczewski in order to attempt to establish the dates when some of the packaging or advertising flyers were used.
[34]
The Board stated that the only relevant evidence in Mr. Joyet's affidavit related to the use of the Respondent's already registered trademarks. With respect to the exhibits attached to Mr. Joyet's affidavit, the Board stated that it would only consider those exhibits for which Mr. Joyet provided a period of use under cross-examination. As for the affidavits of Ms. Clouet and Ms. Dion, the Board stated that it was only considering the packaging and trademarks specifically related to food products. As a result, the Board found six of the examples provided by Ms. Clouet and 21 of the trademarks referenced by Ms. Dion to be relevant to the proceedings.
[35]
In further comments about the evidence, the Board stated that it accepted that the Applicant had used the word mark "tradition" since at least as early as 1984 in association with frozen baked goods and frozen batter for making baked goods. However, the Board also noted that the Applicant's bagel sales did not begin until October 1995 and that its bagels were not packaged individually or in bulk bearing any of the Applicant's trademarks. Regarding the Respondent's sales, the Board pointed out that the Respondent did not provide any figures associated solely with the use of the BAGEL TRADITION'L trademark and, therefore, held that the Respondent's sales figures were of no assistance.
[36]
For the purpose of the opposition proceeding, the Board stated that it was comparing the word mark in the Respondent's proposed trademark with the Applicant's word mark TRADITION, since the Board believed "this is the instance where the [Applicant] has the greatest chance of success because the design portions of the [Applicant's] other Trademarks are totally different from the [Respondent's] Trademark". Moreover, the Board stated that for the purpose of its analysis it would "even consider that the use of any of the [Applicant's] design marks as evidence of the use of the word mark TRADITION".
[37]
The focus of the Board's analysis was on the "confusion" ground of opposition. In making its determination, the Board explicitly dealt with the five factors set out in s. 6(5) of the
Act
, as well as several additional factors. In relation to confusion, the Board made the following findings.
(i) inherent distinctiveness
[38]
Regarding the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks and the extent to which they have become known, the Board held that neither the Applicant's trademarks nor the Respondent's proposed trademark confer much inherent distinctiveness. Specifically, with respect to the Applicant's trademarks, the Board referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In discussing the inherent distinctiveness of the Applicant's trademarks, Justice James O'Reilly stated the following at paragraph 38:
"... The plaintiff's trademark is a common word, suggesting of qualities worthy of respect and preservation, naturally associated with good food. This kind of trademark is less distinctive and generally merits less protection than unique trademarks: [citations omitted]. The evidence shows that the name 'Tradition', or some close variation of it, is used by many other food producers who co-exist in the marketplace seemingly without confusion."
The Board also commented that the Respondent's trademark is very weak because its word element is "highly suggestive of traditional bagels". In comparison, the Board found the Applicant's trademarks to be more known than the Respondent's registered trademarks, particularly given that the Respondent provided no sales figures for products bearing the trademark BAGEL TRADITION'L.
(ii) length of time
[39]
With respect to the length of time the trademarks have been in use, the Board held that this factor favoured the Applicant. The Board accepted that the Applicant has used its trademarks since at least as early as 1984, and that the Respondent had used its trademark since 1997 or 1998.
(iii) nature of wares
[40]
As for the nature of wares, services or business, the Board stated that while the Applicant's and the Respondent's wares fell within the same general class of "baked goods", there is a difference between a bagel and a muffin. Further, with respect to the Respondent's other wares and services, such as the preparation of take-out goods and catering services, the Board held that they are not of the same nature as that of the Applicant.
[41]
Later in its reasons, the Board cited the decision of Justice Louis-Marcel Joyal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 483 (T.D.). At page 490  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of that decision, Justice Joyal stated that the Board and the Court should be cautious about giving too much weight to the fact that wares of the applicant and the opponent exist in the "same general class", especially in the case of a weak mark or weak marks.
(iv) nature of the trade
[42]
In relation to the nature of the trade, the Board noted that although there is an overlap between the Applicant's and Respondent's business activities with respect to the sale of baked goods, the Respondent's other activities are distinct from the Applicant's activities.
(v) degree of resemblance
[43]
Finally, regarding the degree of resemblance between the trademarks in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them, the Board found that by looking at the trademarks as a whole rather than comparing each of their elements separately, the degree of resemblance between the Applicant's and the Respondent's respective trademarks is "rather small". Specifically, the Board noted that because the Respondent's trademark contains a design, the word "bagel", and the "l" symbol, it is distinguishable from the Applicant's trademark TRADITION.
(vi) other factors
[44]
In addition to the factors set out in s. 6(5) of the
Act
, the Board considered several other factors in determining the reasonable likelihood of confusion between the Respondent's and the Applicant's trademarks.
[45]
First, in response to the Respondent's submission that it had already obtained certificates of registration containing the word portion of the trademark - that is, BAGEL TRADITION'L - without opposition by the Applicant, the Board stated that registration of one trademark does not automatically entitle the Respondent to registration of a similar trademark.
[46]
Second, the Board rejected the Applicant's submission that the existence of other trademarks in the Register with the word "tradition" is not relevant to whether or not the average consumer would likely be confused between the Respondent's and Applicant's trademarks, as there is no evidence that any of those other trademarks are used in association with baked goods. The Board disagreed, stating that the average consumer would be able to distinguish the origin of a muffin bearing the trademark TRADITION from a bagel sold in association with the Respondent's proposed trademark.
[47]
Third, the Board dismissed the Applicant's claim that it holds a "family of trademarks" containing the word "tradition". The Board stated that, based on the evidence in the record, the word "tradition" is commonly used by others in the food industry. The Board cited the decision of
Man and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 218 (T.D.), in which Justice Pierre Denault stated that weak trademarks are to be afforded "a minimal level of protection". Because the Applicant's trademark was weak, the Board held that the concept of a family of trademarks was of no assistance to the Applicant.
[48]
Finally, the Board noted that despite the co-existence of the Applicant's and the Respondent's trademarks, there were no reported instances of actual confusion in evidence.
[49]
In summary, the Board held that the Respondent had discharged its burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the Applicant's and Respondent's respective trademarks. The Board gave the following reasons for arriving at this decision:
(a) the Applicant's trademarks have very little inherent distinctiveness when used in association with food products;
(b) when considered in its entirety, the Respondent's trademark is entirely different from the Applicant's trademarks;
(c) no instance of confusion has been proven; and
(d) given the use of other trademarks containing the word "tradition", the average consumer would be able to distinguish between the Applicant's and the Respondent's trademarks.
While the Board considered the word mark "tradition", it also considered the trademarks in their totality. In its reasons, the Board concluded as follows:
"I would have reached the same conclusion if I had compared the Trademark to one of the Opponent's trademarks that contain a design portion. Indeed, the marked difference of the design portions of the trademarks in issue would add to the distinction between the Trademark and the Opponent's other trademarks."
[50]
On the basis of the above reasons, the Board also dismissed the Applicant's two other grounds of opposition, noting that the likelihood of confusion was at the heart of those grounds.
6. Issues
[51]
Two issues are raised on this appeal:
A. Did the Board err in finding that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the Respondent's proposed trademark and the Applicant's trademarks?
B. Did the Board err in disposing of the Applicant's third ground of opposition in respect to distinctiveness as it did?
7. Standard of Review
[52]
Section 56 of the
Act
specifically provides for a right to appeal a decision of the Board to the Federal Court. Moreover, s. 56(5) provides that on appeal the parties may adduce additional evidence that was not before the Board. However, the mere existence of a statutory right of appeal is not sufficient to dictate the standard by which the Court will review the Board's decision. As reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Dr. Q., Re
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170, the Court must still determine the appropriate standard of review by conducting a pragmatic and functional analysis.
[53]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paragraphs 35 to 39, Justice Ian Binnie applied the pragmatic and functional approach in determining the appropriate standard for reviewing an Opposition Board's decision with respect to confusion. Below, I set out the Supreme Court's discussion of each of the four contextual factors:
"(1)
Presence or Absence of a Privative Clause or Statutory Right of Appeal
"¶ 35 The
Act
provides for a full right of appeal to a Federal Court judge who is authorized to receive and consider fresh evidence (sections 56(1) and 56(5). There is no privative clause. Where fresh evidence is admitted, it may, depending on its nature, put quite a different light on the record that was before the Board, and thus require the applications judge to proceed more by way of a fresh hearing on an extended record than a simple appeal (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). Section 56 suggests a legislative intent that there be a full reconsideration not only of legal points but also of issues of fact and mixed fact and law, including the likelihood of confusion. See generally
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at paras. 46-51;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  determination of the likelihood of confusion requires an expertise that is possessed by the Board (which performs such assessments day in and day out) in greater measure than is typical of judges. This calls for some judicial deference to the Board's determination, as this Court stressed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 200:
'In my view the Registrar's decision on the question of whether or not a trademark is confusing should be given great weight and the conclusion of an official whose daily task involves the reaching of conclusions on this and kindred matters under the
Act
should not be set aside lightly but, as was said by Mr. Justice Thorson, then President of the Exchequer Court, in
Freed and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 13]:
"... reliance on the Registrar's decision that two marks are confusingly similar must not go to the extent of relieving the judge hearing an appeal from the Registrar's decision of the responsibility of determining the issue with due regard to the circumstances of the case."'
"¶ 37 What this means in practice is that the decision of the registrar or Board 'should not be set aside lightly considering the expertise of those who regularly make such determinations':
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 210, affd. (1992), 41 C.P.R.(3d) 67 (F.C.A.). Reception of new evidence, of course, might (depending on its content) undermine the factual substratum of the Board's decision and thus rob the decision of the value of the Board's expertise. However, the power of the applications judge to receive and consider fresh evidence does not, in and of itself, eliminate the Board's expertise as a relevant consideration:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 527-28.
"(3)
The Purpose of the
Trade-Marks Act
and in Particular the Trademark Registration Scheme
"¶ 38 In Dr. Q, the Chief Justice pointed out that '[a] statutory purpose that requires a tribunal to select from a range of remedial choices or administrative responses, is concerned with the protection of the public, engages policy issues, or involves the balancing of multiple sets of interests or considerations will demand greater deference from a reviewing court' (para. 31). An inquiry into the likelihood of the 'mistaken inference' does not call for the exercise of discretion. Nor is the Board in this respect making public policy decisions or allocating scarce resources. Essentially, the Board is deciding a lis between the parties in a procedure that looks like an informal version of an everyday court case.
"(4)
Nature of the Question in Dispute
"¶ 39 While the appellant frames its argument as a challenge to the correctness of the interpretation given to s. 6 by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Pink Panther
and
Lexus
, I think that in reality, for reasons which I will develop, its challenge is directed to the relative weight to be given to the s. 6(5) enumerated and unenumerated factors. The legal issue is not neatly extricable from its factual context, but calls for an interpretation within the expertise of the Board. In answer to the
Bibeault
question ('Did the legislator intend the question to be within the jurisdiction conferred on the tribunal?' (p. 1087)), I think the answer is yes, within reasonable limits. See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 595;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 61."
[54]
After considering the four contextual factors - in particular, the right to appeal and the expertise of the Board - Justice Binnie concluded that the applicable standard for reviewing the Board's decision with respect to confusion is reasonableness. The Supreme Court noted that its conclusion is consistent with the jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal: see, for example,
Molson Breweries, A  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 304 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(4th) 51 (F.C.A.); and
Christian  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[55]
In my view, the Supreme Court's analysis and its determination as to the appropriate standard of review are applicable in this present case, primarily because the matter before this Court also revolves around the factual determination by the Board that no confusion between the respective trademarks is reasonably likely.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207, Justice Frank Iacobucci provided some guidance for conducting a review on a reasonableness standard, explaining at paragraph 55 the characteristics of an unreasonable decision.
"A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived."
Such a review requires the Court to conduct a "somewhat probing analysis" into the facts and circumstances before the Board. Moreover, at paragraph 8 of
Christian  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Décary stated that the reasonableness standard is synonymous to "clearly wrong".
[56]
Although the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and the cases referenced, dealt with a decision by the Board concerning confusion between trademarks, in my view, the analysis conducted by the Supreme Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in regards to the four contextual factors on application of the pragmatic and functional approach in respect to confusion applies equally to distinctiveness. In the result, the same standard of review articulated above applies to the Board's decision respecting the issue of distinctiveness.
[57]
The standard of reasonableness applies in circumstances where the Court is reviewing the Board's decision based only on the evidence that was before the Board. However, as previously noted, an appeal pursuant to s. 56 of the
Act
permits either party to introduce new evidence before the Court. In cases where one or both parties elects to do so, the Court will have more latitude in dealing with the Board's decision. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paragraph 29, Justice Marshall Rothstein stated that, where additional evidence is adduced before the Court, the judge hearing the appeal of the Board's decision must come to his or her own conclusion as to the "correctness" of the Board's decisions. Further, as Justice Binnie stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 35, "... [W] here fresh evidence is admitted, it may, [...] require the applications judge to proceed more by way of a fresh hearing on an extended record than a simple appeal".
[58]
The caveat for imposing a more stringent standard of review is that the new evidence must be of such a nature that it would have "materially affected" the Board's finding of fact or the exercise of its discretion. That is, the mere existence of additional evidence is not enough to cause the Court to displace the deference generally afforded to the Board. As Justice Carolyn Layden-Stevenson noted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the new evidence must have some probative value in order for it to be considered:
"To affect the standard of review, the new evidence must be sufficiently substantial and significant. If the additional evidence does not go beyond what was in substance already before the board and adds nothing of probative significance, but merely supplements or is merely repetitive of existing evidence, then a less deferential standard is not warranted. The test is one of quality, not quantity:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.)."
As Justice Layden-Stevenson stated, whether the more exacting standard of correctness is warranted depends on the quality of the additional evidence tendered on appeal.
8. Additional Evidence
[59]
In this appeal, both parties adduced new evidence pursuant to s. 56(5) of the
Act
. The Applicant filed an additional affidavit of Peter Glowczewski, sworn on April 7, 2005. The Respondents tendered the affidavits of Dara Lithwick and Nancy Fraser, who both work for McCarthy Tétrault and who attest to the research they conducted into the use of the words "tradition" or "traditional" in corporate names and in trademarks, respectively.
[60]
The Applicant submits that Mr. Glowczewski's new affidavit provides additional evidence regarding the descriptive nature of the Respondent's mark, the overlap in the nature of the wares of the respective parties, and the likelihood of confusion. Appended to Mr. Glowczewski's affidavit are two exhibits. The first exhibit is a transcript of the examination and cross-examination of François Joyet during trial proceedings in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  distributor, which was circulated to grocery stores. On the second page of the flyer, the products of the Applicant are listed in a row next to the products of the Respondent.
[61]
The Respondent submits that the Court should not consider Mr. Glowczewski's new affidavit in this appeal. The Respondent argues that Mr. Glowczewski's affidavit does not add to the quality of the evidence that was already before the Board and, furthermore, that the transcript of Mr. Joyet's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay. Alternatively, the Respondent submits that should the Court consider Mr. Glowczewski's new evidence in this appeal, then it must also consider the affidavits of Ms. Lithwick and Ms. Fraser.
[62]
After reviewing the affidavits filed in this appeal, I am of the view that none of the additional evidence would have materially affected the Board's findings and will consequently not be received on this appeal. My reasons are as follows.
[63]
In his second affidavit, Mr. Glowczewski provides a timeline for the products sold by the Applicant under the trademark TRADITION, and the promotion and sales related to those products. For example, he states that the Applicant sold frozen bagels from 1993 or 1994 to 2002. He also deposes that from his over 20 years experience in manufacturing and selling baked goods, that all baked goods are invariably displayed together in the same section of the grocery store. Moreover, he attests that it is not surprising that there are no instances of confusion between the parties' trademarks because sales related to the Applicant's products constitute only a fraction of the total retail grocery sales in Canada.
[64]
After reviewing Mr. Glowczewski's affidavit, I am satisfied that his additional evidence adds nothing of probative significance to assist the Court in deciding the issues at play in this appeal. In fact, it appears that much of the evidence in Mr. Glowczewski's new affidavit is intended to clarify the dates related to the exhibits attached to his first affidavit. I note that the Board had already accepted that the Applicant had used its trademarks for a longer period than the Respondent had used its trademarks. Moreover, the Board accepted that the Applicant's and the Respondent's wares fell within the "same general category" known as "baked goods". I am also of the view that Mr. Glowczewski's explanation as to why there are no instances of actual confusion between the Applicant's and Respondent's respective trademarks does not materially affect the Board's reference to the fact that no such instances of actual confusion were presented by either party.
[65]
Regarding the Colabar advertising flyer, Mr. Glowczewski suggests that the flyer evidences the possibility that even grocers will confuse the Applicant's and the Respondent's products. Moreover, in its Memorandum of Fact and Law, the Applicant states that the flyer makes it clear that the parties' products "are being sold and distributed in the identical channels of trade and are sold side by side". In my view, such conclusions cannot be drawn from the flyer. In fact, I would suggest, given that products appearing side by side on the flyer are each listed under different corporate names, that grocers reading the flyer would be more inclined to the view that the two companies listed in each row are not the same. Moreover, I cannot see how the positioning of the Applicant's and the Respondent's products on the advertising flyer has anything to do with where they will ultimately be placed in the grocery stores, which is where consumers will encounter the products. As such, I see no probative value in this advertising flyer.
[66]
As for the transcript of Mr. Joyet's testimony, it is clear that the Applicant wishes to introduce the transcript as evidence that the Respondent's proposed trademark is not distinctive and, therefore, not registrable. The Applicant submits that Mr. Joyet admits, in his own words, that the word "tradition'l" was chosen because the Respondent's bagels are made according to a traditional baking style and a traditional recipe. As such, the Applicant contends that the words in the Respondent's proposed trademark are "clearly descriptive" of the character or quality of the wares and services in association with which the trademark will be used.
[67]
I agree with the Respondent that the transcript of Mr. Joyet's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 81, at paragraphs 58 to 66, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the evidence by prior statement made by a witness in another trial is hearsay. Prior statements made in a different proceeding are generally rejected because they cannot be tested by way of cross-examination in the present proceeding.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a prior statement is only receivable if the person who made the statement is unavailable due to death or disability, or because that person cannot be found.
[68]
In my opinion, the Applicant wishes the Court to admit Mr. Joyet's statements for the "truth" of the words spoken by Mr. Joyet, namely, that the word "tradition'l" is clearly descriptive of the intrinsic quality of bagels. Admitting such evidence for its truth would violate the rule against hearsay, and the Applicant has not pointed to any exception to the hearsay rule applicable to the transcript of Mr. Joyet's testimony.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 353 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 321, the Supreme Court of Canada held that an exception to the hearsay rule exists where necessity dictates such an exception and where reliability of the evidence is established.
[69]
In this case, the Applicant has failed to indicate why it is necessary to introduce Mr. Joyet's testimony through the transcript produced in another proceeding. I note that the Applicant could have asked Mr. Joyet about the choice of the word "tradition'l" when it cross-examined him on the affidavit he swore on May 29, 2000. The Applicant gives no reason for not doing so. Aside from that, the Applicant has also not adequately explained why it was unable to put the testimony of Mr. Joyet recorded in the transcript before the Board. The Applicant states that the cross-examination of Mr. Joyet took place in 2004 and, consequently, that the above evidence could not be brought before the Board. However, as noted above, the Board specifically referred to the decision of Justice O'Reilly in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  his decision on July 20, 2004 - almost five months before the Board released its decision. Given that the Applicant was a party in the proceeding before Justice O'Reilly, the Applicant would have known of the contents of Mr. Joyet's testimony prior to the Board making a decision in the opposition proceeding. If the Applicant felt strongly that Mr. Joyet's statements were probative to the issue of distinctiveness, then it ought to have attempted to bring that evidence before the Board.
[70]
Even if I were to consider Mr. Joyet's testimony as recorded in the transcript, I find that the evidence would not change the conclusion reached by the Board with respect to the issue of distinctiveness. In his testimony, Mr. Joyet states that he considers the Respondent's bagels to be traditional and cooked in a traditional way. However, he also states that other people would not consider the Respondent's bagels to be traditional or cooked in a traditional way. As such, I would find that Mr. Joyet's evidence does not establish that "tradition'l" is clearly descriptive of the "material composition" or the "intrinsic quality" of a bagel.
[71]
In summary, even aside from the issue of admissibility, I am satisfied that the evidence in Mr. Glowczewski's new affidavit and attached exhibits do not add anything that would have materially affected the Board's decision. In light of my finding, it is unnecessary for me to consider the additional evidence tendered by the Respondent. In any event, I am of the view that the affidavits of Ms. Lithwick and Ms. Fraser are not probative either. The Board already had before it ample evidence of the word "tradition" appearing in the trademark Register and on the labels of products sold in grocery stores. Moreover, that evidence did not form a significant basis for the Board's decision.
[72]
For the above reasons, I find that the additional evidence submitted on appeal by the Applicant and the Respondent is not of such a quality that it would have been material to the Board's decision. As a result, I will not proceed by way of a fresh hearing on an extended record. Accordingly, I must decide whether the Board's decisions on the issues of confusion and distinctiveness were reasonable on the evidence that was before it.
8. Analysis
A. Did the Board err in finding that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the Respondent's proposed trademark and the Applicant's trademarks?
[73]
The Applicant argues that the Board erred in concluding that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' respective trademarks. Specifically, the Applicant claims that the error arose because the Board:
(1) applied the wrong test regarding whether similar trademarks can co-exist among food products in the same general class and sold in the same area of a grocery store;
(2) drew an adverse inference against the Applicant for not adducing evidence of actual confusion between the trademarks of the parties;
(3) focused on the design components of the Respondent's trademark and considering the 'L in TRADITION'L to be a symbol, rather than on the similar sound of the parties' respective trademarks; and
(4) dissected the parties' trademarks in determining the degree of resemblance between them, rather than looking at the similarities of the trademarks as a whole.
[74]
The Respondent submits that since the Board considered all the factors set out in s. 6(5) of the
Act
its decision that no such likelihood of confusion existed was reasonable. In particular, the Respondent points to the uncontradicted evidence that there are many other registered trademarks related to food products and services using the word "tradition" as an important factor indicating that there is not a reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' respective trademarks.
[75]
Upon reviewing the Board's decision and the evidence that was before it, I find that it was open to the Board to dismiss the Applicant's opposition on the ground of confusion. I agree with the Board's conclusion that on first impression there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' respective trademarks. In fact, I find there to be almost no points of resemblance between the Applicant's trademarks and the Respondent's proposed trademark when the trademarks are considered in their totality, as the jurisprudence requires. In my opinion, given the significant dissimilarity between the Applicant's trademarks and the Respondent's proposed trademark, this is a case where the degree of resemblance must be given the most weight in determining the issue of confusion.
[76]
Notwithstanding the above, I will now consider the arguments made by the Applicant in this appeal to determine whether the alleged errors if made out are sufficient to undermine the reasonableness of the Board's decision with respect to the issue of confusion.
[77]
Regarding the application of the wrong test, the Applicant submits that the Board misapplied the reasoning in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, in holding that trademarks can co-exist within the same product class of wares sold in the same area of a grocery store. The Applicant states that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court found that registration of a trademark only limits the owner of the registration from excluding others from using the trademark on unrelated food products sold in other sections of the grocery store. In my view, it is the Applicant who has misstated the reasons of the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, Justice Joyal observed that the "narrow protection" doctrine applies equally to the "similarity of wares" factor as it does to the "inherent distinctiveness" factor under s. 6(5) of the
Act
. His point was to caution against giving too much weight to the fact that products fall within the "same general class"; otherwise, holders of weak trademarks would essentially gain a monopoly over a particular word. That is, just because two trademarks operate in the "same general class" does not automatically mean that confusion will ensue. Rather, the Board and the Court must consider more specifically how similar the wares are, especially where the opponent's trademark is found to be not inherently distinctive. In the present case, the Board found both the Applicant's and the Respondent's trademarks to be weak and the nature of their respective wares - muffins versus bagels - to be different. Therefore, in my view, the Board properly applied the Court's decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in affording little weight to the fact that the Applicant's and Respondent's trademarks both exist in the "same general class" of wares.
[78]
With respect to the lack of evidence of actual confusion, the Applicant submits that the Board erred in drawing an adverse inference because there was no evidence of extensive concurrent use of the parties' respective trademarks. The Applicant further argues that, in any event, the existence of actual confusion is irrelevant because the Respondent's trademark application is based on proposed use. Although I agree with the Applicant that there was little evidence of concurrent use presented to the Board, I do not take from the Board's decision that its comment regarding the lack of evidence of actual confusion was determinative of its overall finding with respect to confusion. Moreover, although the trademark at issue in this appeal is a proposed use trademark, similar trademarks owned by the Respondent have appeared on products in the market place for several years now and, as such, it was not improper for the Board to note the fact that no actual instances of confusion between those trademarks and the Applicant's trademarks had been reported.
[79]
Regarding the Applicant's allegation that the Board erred by focusing on the 'L in TRADITION'L, rather than on the similar sound of the parties' respective trademarks, I note first that the proposed trademark of the Respondent is BAGEL TRADITION'L and not just TRADITION'L. In any event, the pronunciation of TRADITION'L in either English or French is different from the sounding out of the Applicant's trademark, TRADITION. As such, in my view, it was reasonably open to the Board to find that an ordinary consumer - even with imperfect recollection - hearing both trademarks would not likely be confused between them.
[80]
I reject the Applicant's fourth allegation that the Board erred in dissecting the parties' trademarks in determining the degree of resemblance between them. I am of the view that the Board did indeed focus on the totality of the trademarks as the jurisprudence requires it to do. While the Board considered the word components of the Respondent's proposed trademark and the Applicant's trademarks in conducting its analysis, it determined that the resemblance between trademarks is "rather small" and, as a result, there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion. The Board's determination, in my view, is based clearly on consideration of the totality of the trademark as required. This is acknowledged by the Board in its reasons. The Board's determination in this respect was reasonably open to it on the record.
[81]
In summary, the role of the Board was to consider the factors set out in subsection 6(5) of the
Act
and any other relevant circumstances that arise in this case, and to weigh those factors in determining whether the Respondent met its burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' trademarks. In my view, the Board properly considered all the factors set out in s. 6(5) and reasonably concluded that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion. Consequently, I find no basis for the Court to disturb the conclusion reached by the Board in respect of this issue.
B. Did the Board err in disposing of the Applicant's third ground of opposition in respect to distinctiveness as it did?
[82]
The Applicant's third ground of opposition is that the Respondent's trademark is not distinctive. The Applicant contends that the Board erred in concluding that the Respondent's proposed trademark is distinctive. In particular, the Applicant argues that the word "tradition'l" is clearly descriptive. Moreover, the Applicant states that there is no evidence that the Respondent's trademark had become distinctive through extensive use at the time its application for registration was made. Aside from the word mark, the Applicant also submits that the design elements of the Respondent's trademark indicate that it is clearly descriptive. Specifically, the Applicant states that the image of a bagel with two sheaves of wheat, as a whole and as a matter of first impression, simply conveys traditional bagels made of wheat. Further, the remaining components of the mark which are not descriptive of the Respondent's wares - namely, the ribbon, the five stars and the font - are insignificant and are overwhelmed by the wheat and the word mark, according to the Applicant.
[83]
In its reasons, the Board considered the inherent distinctiveness of the parties' respective marks as required by s. 6(5) of the
Act
in deciding whether the marks are confusing. The Board found that neither the Applicant's trademark TRADITION nor the Respondent's proposed trademark TRADITION'L have much inherent distinctiveness. The Board went on to dismiss the third ground of opposition in respect of distinctiveness for the same reasons as those offered for dismissing the Applicant's opposition on the ground of confusion.
[84]
In this appeal, the Applicant did not point the Court to any evidence ignored by the Board or to any evidence that establishes that the Respondent's proposed trademark is clearly descriptive. Moreover, in my view, the Board was entitled to consider the Respondent's proposed trademark as a whole and not break it down into its component parts in making its determination. On the evidence, the Applicant has not met its burden of proving that the word "tradition'l" or the imagery of the bagel and wheat sheaves is clearly descriptive of the intrinsic quality of bagels. As a result, it was reasonably open to the Board to dispose of the Applicant's opposition on the ground of distinctiveness as it did. In so doing, it committed no reviewable error.
9. Conclusion
[85]
In summary, I find that the Board committed no reviewable error in disposing of the Applicant's opposition to the registration of the Respondent's proposed trademark. In the result, this appeal will be dismissed with costs.

b) qu'elle soit sous forme graphique, écrite ou sonore, elle donne une description claire ou donne une description fausse et trompeuse, en langue française ou anglaise, de la nature ou de la qualité des marchandises ou services en liaison avec lesquels elle est employée, ou à l'égard desquels on projette de l'employer, ou des conditions de leur production, ou des personnes qui les produisent, ou du lieu d'origine de ces marchandises ou services;
c) elle est constituée du nom, dans une langue, de l'une des marchandises ou de l'un des services à l'égard desquels elle est employée, ou à l'égard desquels on projette de l'employer;
d) elle crée de la confusion avec une marque de commerce déposée;

h) elle est constituée, en tout ou en partie, d'une indication géographique protégée et elle doit être enregistrée en liaison avec un spiritueux dont le lieu d'origine ne se trouve pas sur le territoire visé par l'indication.
"(2) Une marque de commerce qui n'est pas enregistrable en raison de l'alinéa (1)a) ou b) peut être enregistrée si elle a été employée au Canada par le requérant ou son prédécesseur en titre de façon à être devenue distinctive à la date de la production d'une demande d'enregistrement la concernant.
. . . . .
"16(3) Tout requérant qui a produit une demande selon l'article 30 en vue de l'enregistrement d'une marque de commerce projetée et enregistrable, a droit, sous réserve des articles 38 et 40, d'en obtenir l'enregistrement à l'égard des marchandises ou services spécifiés dans la demande, à moins que, à la date de production de la demande, elle n'ait créé de la confusion:
a) soit avec une marque de commerce antérieurement employée ou révélée au Canada par une autre personne;
b) soit avec une marque de commerce à l'égard de laquelle une demande d'enregistrement a été antérieurement produite au Canada par une autre personne;
c) soit avec un nom commercial antérieurement employé au Canada par une autre personne.
"37(1) Le registraire rejette une demande d'enregistrement d'une marque de commerce s'il est convaincu que, selon le cas:
a) la demande ne satisfait pas aux exigences de l'article 30;
b) la marque de commerce n'est pas enregistrable;
c) le requérant n'est pas la personne qui a droit à l'enregistrement de la marque de commerce parce que cette marque crée de la confusion avec une autre marque de commerce en vue de l'enregistrement de laquelle une demande est pendante.
Lorsque le registraire n'est pas ainsi convaincu, il fait annoncer la demande de la manière prescrite.
"(2) Le registraire ne peut rejeter une demande sans, au préalable, avoir fait connaître au requérant ses objections, avec les motifs pertinents, et lui avoir donné une occasion convenable d'y répondre.
"(3) Lorsque, en raison d'une marque de commerce déposée, le registraire a des doutes sur la question de savoir si la marque de commerce indiquée dans la demande est enregistrable, il notifie, par courrier recommandé, l'annonce de la demande au propriétaire de la marque de commerce déposée.
"38(1) Toute personne peut, dans le délai de deux mois à compter de l'annonce de la demande, et sur paiement du droit prescrit, produire au bureau du registraire une déclaration d'opposition.
"(2) Cette opposition peut être fondée sur l'un des motifs suivants:
a) la demande ne satisfait pas aux exigences de l'article 30;
b) la marque de commerce n'est pas enregistrable;
c) le requérant n'est pas la personne ayant droit à l'enregistrement;
d) la marque de commerce n'est pas distinctive.
. . . . .
"(6) Le requérant doit produire auprès du registraire une contre-déclaration et en signifier, dans le délai prescrit après qu'une déclaration d'opposition lui a été envoyée, copie à l'opposant de la manière prescrite.
. . . . .
"(8) Après avoir examiné la preuve et les observations des parties, le registraire repousse la demande ou rejette l'opposition et notifie aux parties sa décision ainsi que ses motifs.
"56(1) Appel de toute décision rendue par le registraire, sous le régime de la présente loi, peut être interjeté à la Cour fédérale dans les deux mois qui suivent la date où le registraire a expédié l'avis de la décision ou dans tel délai supplémentaire accordé par le tribunal, soit avant, soit après l'expiration des deux mois.
"(2) L'appel est interjeté au moyen d'un avis d'appel produit au bureau du registraire et à la Cour fédérale.
"(3) L'appelant envoie, dans le délai établi ou accordé par le paragraphe (1), par courrier recommandé, une copie de l'avis au propriétaire inscrit de toute marque de commerce que le registraire a mentionnée dans la décision sur laquelle porte la plainte et à toute autre personne qui avait droit à un avis de cette décision.
"(4) Le tribunal peut ordonner qu'un avis public de l'audition de l'appel et des matières en litige dans cet appel soit donné de la manière qu'il juge opportune.
"(5) Lors de l'appel, il peut être apporté une preuve en plus de celle qui a été fournie devant le registraire, et le tribunal peut exercer toute discrétion dont le registraire est investi."
