Dubé, J.
: The applicant is an Iranian Muslin claiming refugee status by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution based on religion, political opinion and membership in a particular social group.
[2]
He was refused university entry in 1987 for having failed the Islamic character profile, a refusal he claims was based on his high school participation in pro-Shah activities, and nonattendance at proregime activities and prayer meetings. His friend and regular supplier of pro-Shah pamphlets was executed. He was arrested trying to leave Iran illegally, imprisoned for five months and beaten regularly over this period. After his departure from Iran, revolutionary guards visited his parents' home inquiring about him, insulting and abusing them, and threatening they would find, arrest and execute their son. His father suffered a heart attack.
[3]
In its decision the Refugee Division (the "tribunal") does not challenge the credibility of the applicant, but comes to the conclusion that he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution, largely on the ground that the political situation has changed in Iran and it would now be safe for him to return. That view is based on documentary evidence from a variety of sources, namely newspaper articles from 1991-92 and reports covering the same period by Amnesty International and other human rights monitoring groups.
[4]
However, these and other pieces of documentary evidence properly before the tribunal indicate that hundreds of arrests of persons opposed to the current regime, including those holding monarchists views, continue to occur annually in Iran, and that political executions also remain common.
[5]
In my view, having accepted the evidence of the applicant, the tribunal ought not to have concluded, largely from a selective use of documentary evidence concerning country conditions, that his fear was not objectively well-founded. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the ultimate decision, the tribunal's decision may not be allowed to stand.
[6]
Consequently, the application is allowed, the Refugee Division's decision of December 21, 1992 is set aside and the matter is returned to a tribunal differently constituted for reconsideration not inconsistent with these reasons.
[7]
The parties were given an opportunity under rule 18 of the
Federal Court Immigration Rules, 1993
to request that I certify whether a serious question of general importance is involved in this judicial review for purposes of s. 83 of the
Immigration Act
. I conclude that the question of change of conditions in the country of origin is a question of general importance, and more precisely the criteria for determining when a change is sufficiently significant.
Application allowed.
