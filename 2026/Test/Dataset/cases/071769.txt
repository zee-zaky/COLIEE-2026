Jerome, A.C.J.
: This is an application made pursuant to s. 82.1(1) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, for an order under s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, setting aside the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Board") which held that the applicant is not a Convention refugee. At the conclusion of argument, on January 6, 1995, I took the matter under reserve and indicated that written reasons would follow.
[2]
The applicant, a citizen of the Ukraine, arrived in Canada on June 23, 1992. He claimed refugee status on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his religion, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group. A hearing was held before the Refugee Division on August 19, 1993, and by decision dated December 3, 1993, the panel held that the applicant was not a Convention refugee.
[3]
The facts of this case are not in dispute. In February 1991, the applicant started a small business, buying and selling a variety of goods. The applicant's business also involved giving investment and business advice to others. In September 1991, the applicant was summoned to a local KGB office where he was invited to provide a staff position in his company to a KGB officer and allow them to run his bank accounts. As a result of the applicant's refusal, he was subjected to income tax inspections, interference with his bank accounts and cancellations by suppliers.
[4]
In January 1992, an underground criminal organization, White Lotus, began to extort money from the applicant. The applicant paid White Lotus on several occasions, sometimes after being beaten. On one occasion, when the applicant refused to pay, acid was poured on his stock of clothing and his kiosk was set on fire. The applicant was twice refused police protection. Finally, White Lotus attempted to extort 100,000 rubles from the applicant. When he failed to obtain the required funds, he received a telephone call requesting that he attend at the bank. When the applicant arrived, the bank denied any knowledge of the telephone call. When exiting the bank, the applicant was hit by a car, and warned by one of the occupants to pay White Lotus by June 23, 1992. Unable or unwilling to give in or seek assistance from the police, the applicant left the Ukraine on June 21, 1992. Since then, the applicant has learned that White Lotus has been looking for him, and in the interim has damaged his property.
[5]
The Board found that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution, and was unable or unwilling to seek the protection of the authorities in the Ukraine, but could not demonstrate a link between the persecution claimed and the grounds enumerated in the definition of a Convention refugee. The Board reasoned that "the claimant became a target of White Lotus because, and only because, he had a lot of money." On that basis, the Board determined that persons who are financially successful do not, according to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , constitute a particular social group. The Board also resolved that the applicant was not persecuted because of his political opinion, either actual or implied.
[6]
The applicant now seeks to have that decision set aside on the grounds that the Board erred in law by misconstruing the proper meanings of "political opinion" and "membership in a particular social group" found in the definition of "Convention Refugee" in s. 2 of the
Immigration Act
.
[7]
I am not prepared to set aside the Board's decision. It was reasonably open to the Board to find that the applicant was subject to extortion resulting from his financial success and that this was not related to political opinion or membership in a particular social group.
[8]
Central to the applicant's submission was the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 313 (F.C.A.). There, the applicant had refused to work with the Chilean intelligence organization and as a result, was threatened, arrested and tortured. Despite these atrocities, the Tribunal found that the applicant's fear of persecution did not stem from any stated political opinion and as a result, determined he was not a Convention refugee. On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal found that the Tribunal had erred. The basis for finding an error was stated as follows at page 314:
"The refusal to work with a state organization, when it is accompanied as in this case by arrest, torture and threats, could be related to the ground of political opinion within the meaning of the definition of Convention refugee. The applicant might well be a Convention refugee even if he did not actually state any political opinion, where it is implied in the evidence that the ruling government of the country considers his conduct to be political."
[9]
The applicant points to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and argues that the Board was in error for not concluding that his refusal to cooperate with the KGB, combined with the persecution suffered at the hands of White Lotus was sufficient to found a claim of persecution on the grounds of political opinion.
[10]
In the instant case, however, the facts are distinguishable from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Here, the Board held that the applicant's difficulties did not flow from his refusal to assist the KGB, but rather "because, and only because, he had a lot of money". Consequently, it was not the applicant's failure to state a political opinion that led to the Board's rejection of his claim. The evidence before the Board did not allow it to arrive at the inference that the "ruling government of the country considers his conduct to be political". This was at the heart of its determination. Even if I did not agree with this finding, it was reasonably open to the Board to conclude as it did based on the totality of the evidence before it.
[11]
Similarly, the Board's finding that "even if the KGB and White Lotus are allied ... the alliance is more likely than not for pecuniary, rather than ideological reasons" was reasonably open to it on the evidence. Contrary to the submissions of the applicant, I do not accept that state complicity, in itself, is sufficient to ground a claim of Convention refugee status where that complicity is unrelated to one of the grounds in the Convention refugee definition.
[12]
On the issue of membership in a particular social group, it does not necessarily follow that, merely because the historical underpinning of including the use of the term "particular social group" as found in the Convention, was based on the desire to protect capitalists and independent businessmen fleeing Eastern Bloc persecution during the cold war era, should it lead to the conclusion that the applicant in this case was persecuted for that very reason. Although the applicant is an independent businessman, the Board clearly found that "the reason the claimant is a target of White Lotus is the size of his bank account, and most decidedly not his choice of occupation or the state of his conscience."
[13]
Both parties and the Board cited the three classifications of social group articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Ward
, supra, at 739:
"(1) groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic;
"(2) groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity they should not be forced to forsake the association; and
"(3) groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historic permanence."
[14]
The applicant submitted that the Board erred in failing to find that he was a member of a particular social group as described in the first or the second of the aforementioned categories or classes of persons. I do not agree. I find that the applicant is attempting to invoke the sort of broad interpretation of "social group" that the Supreme Court has already rejected in
Ward
, supra at 729-731. The present state of the law and the unique facts of this case do not dictate, as submitted by the applicant, that his refusal to bow to extortion puts him in a particular social group defined by innate or unchangeable characteristics, nor that his status as a financially successful person in the Ukraine, places him in a particular social group defined by voluntary association "for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity they should not be forced to forsake the association."
[15]
As a whole, I am unable to conclude that the Board erred in law by misconstruing the meanings of "political opinion" or "membership in a particular social group" as they apply to the case of the applicant. In the absence of such an error, there is simply no basis for judicial interference with its decision.
[16]
Accordingly, the application is dismissed without costs.
Application dismissed.
