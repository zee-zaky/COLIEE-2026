Mactavish, J.
: The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration seeks summary judgment declaring that the four members of the defendant family obtained their Canadian citizenship by false representations or fraud, or by knowingly concealing material circumstances. The Minister also seeks an order dismissing the defendants' Counterclaim, and costs on a solicitor and client basis.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the defendants have not raised a triable issue as to whether they obtained their Canadian citizenship as a result of false representations made in their citizenship applications. Consequently the declarations sought by the Minister will issue. I am further satisfied that the defendants' Counterclaim should be summarily dismissed as it too does not raise any triable issues, and that the Minister should have his costs.
I. Background
[3]
The defendants are a mother, father and two adult daughters. The family was landed in Canada on August 16, 2004, and citizenship applications were filed by each of the four defendants on varying dates in 2008.
[4]
Each defendant declared absences from Canada in his or her citizenship application. None of the declared absences were sufficient to raise any questions as to whether the defendants had met the residency requirements of the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-29.
[5]
The defendants were subsequently granted Canadian citizenship. Jennifer Houchaime became a Canadian citizen on September 25, 2008. Her mother, Jacqueline El-Ksayer and her sister, Lynn Houchaime, became Canadian citizens on December 18, 2008, and Jennifer's father, Boutros Naim Houchaime, became a Canadian citizen on May 11, 2009.
[6]
The Minister subsequently came to believe that each of the defendants was in fact resident in Dubai during much of the four year period immediately preceding the granting of their Canadian citizenship. This led the Minister to commence citizenship revocation proceedings.
[7]
In accordance with the provisions of the
Citizenship Act
, the revocation process was commenced by the service of a Notice in Respect of Revocation of Citizenship on each of the defendants. This Notice advised the defendants of the Minister's intent to make a report to the Governor in Council seeking the revocation of each of their citizenship on the grounds that it had been obtained by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances.
[8]
In particular, the Notices assert that each of the defendants "failed to disclose all of [his or her] absences from Canada within the four years immediately preceding [his or her] citizenship application" and that each of the defendants "provided false information on [his or her] application for citizenship with respect to [his or her] residence during the four years immediately preceding [his or her] citizenship application".
[9]
After receipt of the Minister's Revocation Notices, the defendants exercised their statutory rights to have the matters referred to the Federal Court. This was done through the issuance of a Statement of Claim by the Minister. The defendants subsequently filed a Statement of Defence and Counterclaim. The parties have since exchanged affidavits of documents, but no examinations for discovery were held prior to the Minister bringing his motion for summary judgment in relation to both the claim and the counterclaim.
II. The Nature of the Proceedings and the Law
[10]
In order to situate the arguments of the parties, it is necessary to have an understanding of the citizenship revocation process.
[11]
A reference by the Minister under paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Citizenship Act
is not an action in the conventional sense of the word. Rather, it is "essentially an investigative proceeding used to collect evidence of facts surrounding the acquisition of citizenship, so as to determine whether it was obtained by fraudulent means":
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 15, [2002] F.C.J. No. 1800.
[12]
The task for the Court in a proceeding such as this is to make factual findings as to whether the defendants obtained their Canadian citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances. Findings made by this Court under paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Citizenship Act
are final, and cannot be appealed.
[13]
The Court's factual findings are not determinative of any legal rights. That is, the decision does not have the effect of revoking the defendants' Canadian citizenship:
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 152, 142 N.R. 173 (FCA).
[14]
These findings may, however, form the basis of a report by the Minister to the Governor in Council requesting the revocation of the defendants' citizenship. The ultimate decision with respect to the revocation of citizenship rests with the Governor in Council, which is the only authority empowered to revoke citizenship.
[15]
Subsection 10(1) of the
Citizenship Act
allows the Governor in Council to revoke the citizenship of an individual where the Governor in Council is satisfied, on the basis of a report from the Minister, that the person has obtained his or her citizenship "by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances".
[16]
A decision by the Governor in Council to revoke an individual's citizenship may be judicially reviewed in this Court:
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 15, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1248.
III. The Burden and Standard of Proof
[17]
The burden is on the Minister to demonstrate that the defendants obtained their Canadian citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances:
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 21, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1249.
[18]
The standard of proof is that of the balance of probabilities: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 23. The balance of probabilities standard will be satisfied if the evidence establishes that it is more probable than not that something occurred. That is, I must be satisfied that an event or fact in dispute is not only possible, but probable: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 25.
[19]
Before examining whether the Minister has met his burden in this case and whether the defendants have raised a triable issue in this regard, I must first address the defendants' motion to examine a non-party for discovery.
IV. The Defendants' Motion for Discovery of a Non-party
[20]
This action was commenced in January of 2013. On August 21, 2013, counsel for the defendants advised the Minister that he was contemplating bringing a motion to examine the immigration consultant who allegedly assisted the defendants with their citizenship applications. Counsel for the defendants further advised that if the Minister proceeded with a motion for summary judgment, he would seek an adjournment of that motion, if necessary, so as to permit the bringing of a third-party discovery motion. Months passed, and no such motion was ever brought by the defendants.
[21]
In January of 2014, counsel for the Minister advised counsel for the defendants that she would be proceeding with her motion for summary judgment. Counsel for the defendants responded that before the motion for summary judgment could be dealt with, his motion for the discovery of a non-party had to be heard. However, no such motion was brought at that time.
[22]
The Minister's motion for summary judgment was set down for hearing on March 4, 2014. On the return of the motion, counsel for the defendants sought an adjournment of the Minister's motion so as to allow for the bringing of a motion for the examination of the immigration consultant. Justice Kane agreed to adjourn the Minister's motion to April 1, 2014. However, her March 5, 2014 Order expressly stated that "no further adjournments will be permitted, regardless of the defendants' ability to discover the non-party in the intervening period".
[23]
The defendants finally did bring their motion to discover the immigration consultant, making it returnable on April 1, 2014, the date set for the hearing of the Minister's motion for summary judgment. Once again, the defendants sought to have the Minister's motion adjourned so as to permit the examination for discovery to take place.
[24]
After hearing the parties in relation to the defendants' request for an adjournment, I ruled that I would not entertain the motion for discovery of the immigration consultant in light of the dilatory conduct on the part of the defendants in pursuing this issue. I further noted that Justice Kane's March 5, 2014 Order was very clear that no further adjournments of the Minister's motion would be granted to the defendants so as to permit them to pursue the discovery of the immigration consultant. Justice Kane's order was equally clear that the Minister's motion for summary judgment would proceed on April 1, 2014, regardless of whether or not the defendants had been able to discover the non-party in the intervening period.
[25]
I further advised the parties that having heard from them with respect to the merits of the defendants' motion, I would not have granted the motion in any event. The defendants' allegations as to the potential relevance of the immigration consultant's evidence were vague and non-specific, and counsel for the defendants was unable to articulate what the immigration consultant could possibly say that would assist the defendants in their defence of the Minister's action.
V. Principles Governing Summary Judgment
[26]
Before turning to consider the evidence in this matter, I would first note that in deciding whether summary judgment should issue, the Court must determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial with respect to either a claim or a defence. The purpose of summary judgment is to allow the Court to summarily dispense with actions that ought not to proceed to trial because they do not raise a genuine issue to be tried.
[27]
The test on a motion for summary judgment "is not whether a party cannot possibly succeed at trial; rather, it is whether the case is so doubtful that it does not deserve consideration by the trier of fact at a future trial". As a consequence, "summary judgment is not restricted to the clearest of cases": all quotes from
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
VI. Should Summary Judgment be Granted in Relation to the Minister's Action?
[28]
In addressing the question of whether summary judgment should be granted in relation to the Minister's action, I must first address the defendants' contention that the Minister's action is statute-barred.
A. Is the Minister's Action Statute-Barred?
[29]
In their statement of defence, the defendants plead that the Minister's action is statute-barred as a result of the combined effect of section 32 of the federal
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-50 and sections 4 and 5 of the Ontario
Limitations Act,
2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B.
[30]
Section 32 of the federal
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
provides that, subject to certain exceptions, "the laws relating to prescription and the limitation of actions in force in a province between subject and subject apply to any proceedings by or against the Crown in respect of any cause of action arising in that province ...".
[31]
Section 4 of the Ontario
Limitations Act
creates a general two-year limitation period for "claims". Section 5 deals with the issue of discoverability. According to the defendants, because the Minister did not commence revocation proceedings within two years of the defendants receiving Canadian citizenship, the combined effect of these legislative provisions is that the Minister's action is now statute-barred.
[32]
There are several problems with the defendants' arguments. The first is that it does not appear that an action such as this meets the statutory definition of a "claim" as contemplated by section 4 of the Ontario
Limitations Act
. A "claim" is defined in the Act as meaning "a claim to remedy an injury, loss or damage that occurred as a result of an act or omission".
[33]
The second problem is that having denied having that they made any false representations in connection with their citizenship applications, the defendants have not indicated how any such representations on their part could have been discovered any earlier by the Minister.
[34]
Thirdly, paragraph 16(1)(a) of the Ontario
Limitations Act
provides that there is no limitation period in relation to "a proceeding for a declaration if no consequential relief is sought".
[35]
Finally, as the Federal Court of Appeal observed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, it is illogical for defendants to ask for the termination of a reference that they themselves have requested for their own benefit on the grounds of prescription: at para. 48.
[36]
As a consequence, the defendants have not raised a triable issue with respect to the limitations question.
[37]
I will next review the evidence regarding each of the defendants in order to determine whether any of the defendants have raised a triable issue as to the truth of the representations made in their citizenship applications.
B. Boutros Naim Houchaime
[38]
Boutros Naim Houchaime stated in his citizenship application that he was present in Canada for 1,153 days during the relevant period. He also stated that he was absent from Canada on fifteen occasions totalling 307 days during the four year period immediately preceding his application for citizenship in October of 2008.
[39]
As a result of a request made through diplomatic channels, the Minister subsequently obtained a copy of Mr. Houchaime's travel history from the Ministry of the Interior for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), along with travel histories for the other three members of the family.
[40]
The Minister has provided an affidavit from a Liaison Officer with the Canada Border Services Agency office in Dubai, who deposes that the UAE maintains strict entry and exit controls over the travel of persons residing in the UAE on residency permits. The CBSA Officer further deposes that these controls exist at all ports of entry and exit from the UAE. It is uncontroverted that the applicants, who were citizens of Lebanon, were in the UAE on residency permits during the relevant period.
[41]
The travel history for Mr. Houchaime reveals that, contrary to the information provided to the Government of Canada in his citizenship application, Mr. Houchaime was in fact spending the vast majority of his time living in Dubai during the relevant period, leaving the UAE only periodically for short trips abroad. Moreover, publicly available information suggests that Mr. Houchaime was working as the Managing Director of Mechwatt Electromechanical Works LLC in Dubai, an assertion that he has not denied in his affidavit.
[42]
The accuracy and reliability of the travel histories provided by the UAE has not been questioned by the defendants. Moreover, counsel for the defendants has acknowledged that there is no evidence before me from Mr. Houchaime to contradict the travel history reflected in the UAE's records relating to him. Indeed, Mr. Houchaime has not denied that his citizenship application did not accurately reflect his periods of residence in Canada.
[43]
Mr. Houchaime's only defence is his vague assertion that he relied on his Canadian immigration consultant to prepare his citizenship application, suggesting in his affidavit that any material misstatements in the applications were the responsibility of the consultant. Mr. Houchaime further asserts that the defendants "did not have detailed knowledge of the contents of the citizenship applications filed notwithstanding that they signed said applications as filed on the advice and encouragement of [the consultant] ".: Houchaime affidavit at para. 11
[44]
Mr. Houchaime has, however, provided no evidence as to what information he provided to the consultant with respect to his periods of residency in Canada, nor has he explained how patently false information came to be included in his application.
[45]
In accordance with Rule 214 of the
Federal Courts Rules
, S.O.R./98-106, a response to a motion for summary judgment cannot be based upon what might be adduced as evidence at a later stage in the proceeding. Rather, respondents are required to "set out specific facts and adduce the evidence showing that there is a genuine issue for trial". Mr. Houchaime's evidence as to the role of the immigration consultant is entirely unsatisfactory and does not come close to meeting the threshold contemplated by Rule 214
[46]
It is also noteworthy that passport applications completed by the family after they obtained Canadian citizenship also contain material misinformation as to where they had been living during the time periods in issue. There is no suggestion in Mr. Houchaime's affidavit that the immigration consultant had any involvement in the completion of the family's passport applications.
[47]
Given that the family's passport applications were prepared after they obtained their Canadian citizenship, they are not directly relevant to the question of whether they obtained their citizenship as a result of false representations. However, the inaccuracies in the passport applications, each of which was signed by the defendants who solemnly declared that the statements made in the applications were true, are evidence of additional attempts by the family to mislead Canadian immigration authorities as to their whereabouts during the relevant periods.
[48]
In the circumstances, Mr. Houchaime has not persuaded me that there exists a genuine issue for trial in relation to the Minister's action. I am satisfied that he obtained his Canadian citizenship as a result of false information in his citizenship application and summary judgment will be granted declaring this to be the case.
[49]
Before turning to review the evidence regarding the other three members of the family, I would note that no evidence has been provided by any of them with respect to the truth of the contents of each of their citizenship applications. The onus on a party to "put their best foot forward" in response to a motion for summary judgment:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . However, the three other defendants rely only on Mr. Houchaime's affidavit, and, in particular, his vague and unsupported assertion of reliance on the immigration consultant.
C. Jacqueline El-Ksayer
[50]
Jacqueline El-Ksayer is Mr. Houchaime's wife. Her citizenship application states that she was resident in Canada for 1,176 days during the relevant period, and that she was absent from Canada on only seven occasions totalling 133 days during the four year period immediately prior to her application for citizenship in December of 2008.
[51]
However, the UAE travel history for Ms. El-Ksayer reveals that after landing in Canada in August of 2004, Ms. El-Ksayer then returned to Dubai on September 7, 2004. The record further reveals that she remained in the UAE for most of the next four years, interrupted only by several short absences, particularly in the summer months. Once again, Ms. El-Ksayer's travel history bears no relationship to the Canadian residence declared in her citizenship application.
[52]
Ms. El-Ksayer has not denied that her citizenship application contains false representations and she has not persuaded me that there exists a genuine issue for trial in relation to the Minister's claim for a declaration to that effect. I am satisfied that she obtained her Canadian citizenship as a result of false information in her citizenship application and summary judgment will be granted against her declaring that to be the case.
D. Jennifer Hochaime
[53]
Jennifer Hochaime is one of Mr. Houchaime and Ms. El-Ksayer's daughters. Although she was a child when she was landed in Canada, she had attained the age of majority by the time that she signed her application for Canadian citizenship on September 25, 2008.
[54]
Jennifer's citizenship application states that she was resident in Canada for 1,126 days during the relevant period, and that she was only absent from Canada on three occasions for a total of 134 days during the four year period immediately prior to her citizenship application.
[55]
However, Jennifer's UAE travel history reveals that after landing in Canada in August of 2004, she promptly returned to Dubai on September 7, 2004, remaining there until July 16, 2005. She left Dubai for a couple of weeks in the summer of 2005, returning on August 13, 2005. The pattern then repeated itself, with Jennifer remaining in Dubai between August of 2005 and July of 2006, and a similar travel pattern is demonstrated in 2007.
[56]
Jennifer's travel pattern is thus consistent with someone attending school in Dubai. This is not a mere suspicion on my part, however. The uncontroverted evidence adduced by the Minister demonstrates that Jennifer was in fact attending the Emirates Academy of Hospitality Management from October of 2004 to July of 2008. As part of her studies at the Emirates Academy, Jennifer spent the period from January of 2007 to November of 2007 participating in an exchange program at the École hotelière de Lausanne in Switzerland, following which she once again returned to Dubai.
[57]
The Minister has produced written confirmation from both of these institutions confirming that Jennifer was physically present at each institution during the periods in question. These are periods when, according to her citizenship application, Jennifer was supposed to be residing in Canada.
[58]
Once again, Jennifer has not challenged this evidence in any meaningful way. As a consequence, she has not persuaded me that there exists a genuine issue for trial in relation to the Minister's action. I am satisfied that Jennifer Hochaime obtained her Canadian citizenship as a result of false information in her citizenship application and summary judgment will be granted against her declaring that to be the case.
E. Lynn Hochaime
[59]
Lynn Hochaime is Mr. Houchaime and Ms. El-Ksayer's other daughter. Like her sister Jennifer, Lynn was a child at the time that she was landed in Canada, although she too had attained the age of majority by the time that she signed her application for Canadian citizenship on March 18, 2008.
[60]
Lynn's citizenship application states that she was resident in Canada for 1,222 days during the relevant period, and that she was only absent from Canada on three occasions totalling 87 days during the four year period immediately prior to signing her citizenship application.
[61]
However, Jennifer's UAE travel history reveals that after landing in Canada in August of 2004, she returned to Dubai on September 7, 2004 - the same day that her sister and mother returned to the UAE. Lynn remained in Dubai for most of the next four years, with short trips out of the country, particularly in the summer months.
[62]
Once again, Lynn's travel pattern is consistent with someone attending school in the UAE. Indeed, the Minister has obtained evidence that she was in fact attending high school at the Al Mawakeb School in Dubai until her graduation from that institution in 2007.
[63]
Lynn's citizenship application indicates that she began attending McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario in September of 2006. However, information obtained from the University by the Minister reveals that she did not start at McMaster until September of 2008, a fact that is confirmed by Lynn's own online "LinkedIn" profile.
[64]
As was the case with the other members of her family, Lynn has not challenged the evidence against her in any meaningful way. As a consequence, she has not persuaded me that there exists a genuine issue for trial in relation to the Minister's action. I am satisfied that Lynn Hochaime obtained her Canadian citizenship as a result of false information in her citizenship application and summary judgment will be granted against her declaring that to be the case.
VII. Should Summary Judgment be Granted in Relation to the Defendants' Counterclaim?
[65]
The Minister also seeks summary judgment dismissing the defendants' counter-claim. As will be explained below, I am satisfied that summary judgment should also issue with respect to the Counterclaim as none of the defendants have demonstrated the existence of a triable issue in this regard.
[66]
In their Counterclaim, the defendants assert that sections 10, paragraph 18(1)(b) and subsection 18(3) of the
Citizenship Act
are inconsistent with section 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and violate their liberty interests.
[67]
Canadian citizenship is a valuable privilege (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), and the stakes are undoubtedly high for the defendants. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that the Minister is trying to deprive the defendants of their citizenship through this proceeding, and
not
their liberty. Indeed, the defendants have not explained how their liberty interests have been engaged by this proceeding.
[68]
The defendants have, moreover, acknowledged that the Federal Court of Appeal "has consistently ruled that section 7 [of] the Charter [does] not apply to revocation proceedings in the Federal Court", suggesting that this Court should, however, "revisit these issues in light of the facts and arguments" advanced by the defendants: Defendants' Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 17.
[69]
The Federal Court of Appeal has indeed been clear that citizenship revocation proceedings do not engage section 7 of the Charter: see, for example, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above.
[70]
Clearly, it is not open to this Court to "revisit" the binding rulings of the Federal Court of Appeal. Moreover, even if the Court were able to do so, in the absence of any explanation as to how the defendants' section 7 interests have been engaged by the revocation process in this case, the defendants have simply not established
any
basis for their section 7 Charter claim, and no triable issue has been raised in this regard.
[71]
Consequently, an order will issue dismissing the defendants' Counterclaim.
VIII. Costs
[72]
The nature and extent of the defendants' false representations are such that the Minister should be entitled to his solicitor and client costs of these proceedings.
JUDGMENT
[73]
THIS COURT DECLARES that
:
1. Each of the defendants Boutros Naim Houchaime, Jacqueline El-Ksayer, Jennifer Hochaime and Lynn Hochaime obtained their Canadian citizenship by false representation or fraud and by knowingly concealing material circumstances within the meaning of paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29;
2. The defendants' Counterclaim is dismissed; and
3. The Minister shall have his solicitor and client costs of these proceedings.
.........................
Le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration (demandeur/défendeur reconventionnel) v. Houchaine, Boutros Naim; El-Skayer, Jacqueline Mousa; Hochaime, Lynn Boutros; Hochaime, Jennifer Boutros (défendeurs/demandeurs reconventionnels)
[1]
La juge Mactavish
[Traduction]: Le ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration sollicite un jugement sommaire déclarant que les quatre membres de la famille défenderesse ont acquis leur citoyenneté canadienne par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration ou de la dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels. Le ministre sollicite également une ordonnance rejetant la demande reconventionnelle des défendeurs, ainsi que les dépens sur une base avocat-client.
[2]
Pour les motifs exposés ci-après, je suis convaincue que les défendeurs n'ont pas soulevé une question litigieuse en ce qui concerne l'acquisition de leur citoyenneté canadienne au moyen de fausses déclarations formulées dans leurs demandes de citoyenneté. En conséquence, les jugements déclaratoires sollicités par le ministre seront rendus. Je suis également convaincue que la demande reconventionnelle des défendeurs devrait être rejetée sommairement, parce qu'elle ne soulève aucune question litigieuse, et que le ministre devrait se voir adjuger les dépens.
I. Le contexte
[3]
Les défendeurs sont une mère, un père et deux filles d'âge adulte. La famille a obtenu le droit d'établissement au Canada le 16 août 2004, et chacun des quatre défendeurs a déposé une demande de citoyenneté à des dates différentes en 2008.
[4]
Chacun des défendeurs a déclaré des absences du Canada dans sa demande de citoyenneté. Aucune des absences déclarées n'était suffisante en soi pour soulever des doutes quant à la question de savoir si les défendeurs avaient satisfait à l'obligation de résidence énoncée dans la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, LRC 1985, c C-29.
[5]
Les défendeurs ont subséquemment obtenu la citoyenneté canadienne. Jennifer Houchaime est devenue citoyenne canadienne le 25 septembre 2008, sa mère, Jacqueline El-Ksayer, et sa sœur, Lynn Houchaime, le 18 décembre 2008 et son père, Boutros Naim Houchaime, le 11 mai 2009.
[6]
Par la suite, le ministre en est arrivé à croire que chacun des défendeurs résidait effectivement à Dubaï au cours d'une grande partie de la période de quatre ans précédant l'attribution de leur citoyenneté canadienne, ce qui l'a incité à engager des procédures d'annulation de la citoyenneté.
[7]
Conformément aux dispositions de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, le processus d'annulation a été enclenché par la signification d'un avis préalable à l'annulation à chacun des défendeurs. Cet avis informait les défendeurs de l'intention du ministre d'établir et de remettre au gouverneur en conseil un rapport demandant l'annulation de la citoyenneté de chacun d'eux, parce que celle-ci avait été acquise par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration ou de la dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels.
[8]
Plus précisément, il est allégué dans les avis que chacun des défendeurs [traduction] « a omis de déclarer toutes ses absences du Canada au cours des quatre ans précédant immédiatement sa demande de citoyenneté » et que chacun d'eux [traduction] « a fourni de faux renseignements dans sa demande de citoyenneté en ce qui concerne son lieu de résidence au cours des quatre ans précédant la date de sa demande de citoyenneté ».
[9]
Après avoir reçu les avis préalables du ministre, les défendeurs ont demandé le renvoi des affaires devant la Cour fédérale conformément à la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
. Ce renvoi a été fait au moyen d'un avis introductif d'instance déposé par le ministre. Les défendeurs ont subséquemment déposé une défense et une demande reconventionnelle. Les parties ont ensuite échangé des affidavits de documents, mais aucun interrogatoire préalable n'a été tenu avant que le ministre présente sa requête en jugement sommaire à l'égard de la demande principale et de la demande reconventionnelle.
II. La nature de l'instance et les règles de droit
[10]
Afin de situer les arguments des parties, il est nécessaire de comprendre le processus d'annulation de la citoyenneté.
[11]
Un renvoi effectué par le ministre au titre de l'alinéa 18(1)
b)
de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
n'est pas une action dans le sens conventionnel du terme. Le renvoi est plutôt « essentiellement une procédure d'enquête visant à colliger la preuve des faits entourant l'acquisition de la citoyenneté en vue de déterminer si elle a été obtenue par des moyens dolosifs »:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] ACF no 1800, au paragraphe 15.
[12]
La Cour a donc pour tâche de tirer des conclusions de fait au sujet de la question de savoir si les défendeurs ont obtenu la citoyenneté canadienne par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration ou de la dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels. La décision de la Cour au titre de l'alinéa 18(1)
b
) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
est définitive et n'est pas susceptible d'appel.
[13]
Les conclusions de fait de la Cour ne déterminent pas de droits juridiques. Cela signifie que la décision n'a pas pour effet d'annuler la citoyenneté canadienne des défendeurs:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration) . Tobiass
, [1997] 3 RCS 391, [1997] ACS no 82, au paragraphe 52, qui cite
Canada (Secrétaire d'État) c Luitjens
, [1992] ACF no 319, 142 NR 173 (CAF), au paragraphe 152.
[14]
Ces conclusions peuvent toutefois constituer le fondement d'un rapport présenté par le ministre au gouverneur en conseil en vue de demander l'annulation de la citoyenneté des défendeurs. La décision définitive à ce sujet incombe au gouverneur en conseil, qui seul est habilité à annuler la citoyenneté.
[15]
Le paragraphe 10(1) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
permet au gouverneur en conseil d'annuler la citoyenneté d'une personne lorsqu'il est convaincu, sur rapport du ministre, que cette personne a acquis sa citoyenneté « par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration ou de la dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels ».
[16]
La décision du gouverneur en conseil d'annuler la citoyenneté d'une personne peut faire l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 1248, au paragraphe 15.
III. Le fardeau de la preuve et la norme de preuve
[17]
Il incombe au ministre d'établir que les défendeurs ont acquis leur citoyenneté canadienne par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration ou de la dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 1249, au paragraphe 21.
[18]
La norme de preuve est la prépondérance des probabilités: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 23. La norme de la prépondérance des probabilités sera respectée si les éléments de preuve établissent qu'il est plus probable qu'improbable que quelque chose se soit produit. Autrement dit, je dois être convaincue qu'un événement ou un fait en litige est non seulement possible, mais qu'il est probable: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 25.
[19]
Avant de me demander si le ministre s'est acquitté de son fardeau en l'espèce et si les défendeurs ont soulevé une question litigieuse à ce sujet, je dois d'abord examiner la requête des défendeurs en vue de soumettre un tiers à un interrogatoire préalable.
IV. La requête des défendeurs en vue de soumettre un tiers à un interrogatoire préalable
[20]
La présente action a été engagée en janvier 2013. Le 21 août 2013, l'avocat des défendeurs a fait savoir au ministre qu'il envisageait la possibilité de présenter une requête en vue d'interroger le consultant en immigration qui avait apparemment aidé les défendeurs à préparer leurs demandes de citoyenneté. L'avocat des défendeurs a ajouté que, si le ministre présentait une requête en jugement sommaire, il solliciterait un ajournement de cette requête, au besoin, afin de pouvoir présenter une requête visant à obtenir l'autorisation de soumettre un tiers à un interrogatoire préalable. Plusieurs mois se sont écoulés, mais les défendeurs n'ont présenté aucune requête de cette nature.
[21]
En janvier 2014, l'avocate du ministre a avisé l'avocat des défendeurs qu'elle présenterait sa requête en jugement sommaire. L'avocat des défendeurs a répondu qu'avant que cette requête en jugement sommaire puisse être examinée, sa requête visant à soumettre un tiers à un interrogatoire préalable devait être entendue. Cependant, aucune requête de cette nature n'a été présentée à ce moment-là.
[22]
L'audience relative à la requête en jugement sommaire du ministre a été fixée au 4 mars 2014. Lors de la présentation de la requête, l'avocat des défendeurs a sollicité un ajournement afin de permettre le dépôt d'une requête visant à obtenir l'autorisation d'interroger le consultant en immigration. La juge Kane a consenti à ajourner la requête du ministre jusqu'au 1er avril 2014. Cependant, dans son ordonnance datée du 5 mars 2014, elle a précisé [traduction] qu' « aucun autre ajournement ne sera autorisé, que les défendeurs aient ou non, entre-temps, la possibilité d'interroger le tiers au préalable ».
[23]
Les défendeurs ont finalement déposé leur requête visant à soumettre le consultant en immigration à un interrogatoire préalable, précisant que celle-ci serait présentée le 1er avril 2014, soit la date fixée pour l'audition de la requête en jugement sommaire du ministre. Encore là, les défendeurs ont tenté de faire ajourner la requête du ministre afin de permettre la tenue de l'interrogatoire préalable.
[24]
Après avoir entendu les parties au sujet de la demande d'ajournement des défendeurs, j'ai décidé que je n'examinerais pas la requête visant à soumettre le consultant en immigration à un interrogatoire préalable, eu égard au comportement dilatoire dont les défendeurs ont fait preuve relativement au traitement de cette question. J'ai ajouté que, dans son ordonnance du 5 mars 2014, la juge Kane avait mentionné très clairement que la Cour n'accorderait aucun autre ajournement de la requête du ministre aux défendeurs en vue de leur permettre d'interroger au préalable le consultant en immigration. La juge Kane a également mentionné en toutes lettres dans son ordonnance que la requête en jugement sommaire du ministre serait entendue le 1er avril 2014, que les défendeurs aient été en mesure ou non, entre-temps, d'interroger le tiers au préalable.
[25]
Qui plus est, j'ai fait savoir aux parties que, ayant entendu leurs plaidoiries concernant le bien-fondé de la requête des défendeurs, je n'aurais pas accordé la requête de toute façon. Les allégations des défendeurs quant à la pertinence possible du témoignage du consultant en immigration étaient imprécises, et l'avocat des défendeurs a été incapable d'expliquer en quoi ce témoignage pourrait aider ces derniers dans leur défense à l'action du ministre.
V. Les principes régissant les jugements sommaires
[26]
Avant d'examiner la preuve sur cette question, je souligne d'abord que, pour décider s'il y a lieu de rendre un jugement sommaire, la Cour doit établir si la déclaration ou la défense, selon le cas, soulève une véritable question litigieuse. Le jugement sommaire a pour but de permettre à la Cour de se prononcer par voie sommaire sur les affaires qu'elle n'estime pas nécessaire d'entendre, parce qu'elles ne soulèvent pas de véritable question litigieuse.
[27]
La question qui se pose lors de l'examen d'une requête en jugement sommaire n'est pas « de savoir si une partie n'a aucune chance d'obtenir gain de cause au procès, mais plutôt d'établir si le succès de la demande est tellement douteux que celle-ci ne mérite pas d'être examinée par le juge des faits dans le cadre d'un éventuel procès ». Par conséquent, « les jugements sommaires ne sont pas réservés aux affaires particulièrement claires »: toutes les citations sont tirées de la décision
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 9 à 11;
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 17.
VI. Y a-t-il lieu de rendre un jugement sommaire au sujet de l'action du ministre?
[28]
Pour décider s'il y a lieu de rendre un jugement sommaire à l'égard de l'action du ministre, je dois d'abord examiner l'allégation des défendeurs selon laquelle l'action du ministre est prescrite.
A. L'action du ministre est-elle prescrite?
[29]
Dans leur défense, les défendeurs allèguent que l'action du ministre est prescrite, en raison de l'effet combiné de l'article 32 de la
Loi sur la responsabilité civile de l'État et le contentieux administratif
, LRC 1985, c C-50, et des articles 4 et 5 de la loi de l'Ontario intitulée
Loi de 2002 sur la prescription des actions
, LO 2002, c 24, annexe B.
[30]
L'article 32 de la
Loi sur la responsabilité civile de l'État et le contentieux administratif
prévoit que, sous réserve de certaines exceptions, « les règles de droit en matière de prescription qui, dans une province, régissent les rapports entre particuliers s'appliquent lors des poursuites auxquelles l'État est partie pour tout fait générateur survenu dans la province [...] »
[31]
L'article 4 de la
Loi de 2002 sur la prescription des actions
établit un délai de prescription général de deux ans dans le cas des « réclamations ». L'article 5 porte sur la découverte des faits. Selon les défendeurs, étant donné que le ministre n'a pas engagé la procédure d'annulation dans les deux années suivant la date à laquelle les défendeurs ont acquis la citoyenneté canadienne, l'action en question est prescrite, en raison de l'effet combiné des dispositions législatives susmentionnées.
[32]
Les arguments des défendeurs sont problématiques à plusieurs égards. D'abord, il ne semble pas que la définition du mot « réclamation » au sens de l'article 4 de la
Loi de 2002 sur la prescription des actions
englobe les actions comme celle dont la Cour est saisie en l'espèce. Dans cette loi, le mot « réclamation » est défini ainsi: « réclamation pour obtenir réparation de préjudices, de pertes ou de dommages survenus par suite d'un acte ou d'une omission et, en outre, droit de réclamation qui peut être exercé à cette fin ».
[33]
En deuxième lieu, étant donné que les défendeurs ont nié avoir formulé de fausses déclarations en liaison avec leurs demandes de citoyenneté, ils n'ont pas précisé comment le ministre aurait pu découvrir plus tôt des déclarations de cette nature qu'ils auraient faites.
[34]
En troisième lieu, l'alinéa 16(1)
a
) de la
Loi de 2002 sur la prescription des actions
dispose qu'aucun délai de prescription n'est prévu dans le cas des « instances en déclaration judiciaire s'il n'est demandé aucun redressement indirect ».
[35]
Enfin, comme la Cour d'appel fédérale l'a souligné dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, il n'est pas logique de la part des défendeurs de demander qu'il soit mis un terme, au motif de prescription, à un renvoi qu'ils ont eux-mêmes demandé pour leur propre bénéfice (paragraphe 48).
[36]
En conséquence, les défendeurs n'ont pas soulevé de question litigieuse en ce qui concerne la prescription.
[37]
J'examine maintenant la preuve concernant chacun des défendeurs pour savoir si l'un deux a soulevé une question litigieuse en ce qui concerne la véracité des déclarations qui figurent dans leurs demandes de citoyenneté.
B. Boutros Naim Houchaime
[38]
Boutros Naim Houchaime a déclaré dans sa demande de citoyenneté qu'il avait été présent au Canada pendant 1 153 jours au cours de la période pertinente. Il a également affirmé s'être absenté du Canada à quinze occasions pour un total de 307 jours au cours des quatre ans précédant la demande de citoyenneté qu'il a présentée en octobre 2008.
[39]
Par suite d'une demande présentée par les voies diplomatiques, le ministre a obtenu du ministre de l'Intérieur des Émirats arabes unis (les EAU) une copie des antécédents de voyage de M. Houchaime ainsi que des trois autres membres de la famille.
[40]
Le ministre a fourni un affidavit dans lequel un agent de liaison du bureau de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada à Dubaï affirme que les EAU prennent des mesures de contrôle strictes à l'entrée et à la sortie des personnes qui résident aux EAU avec des cartes de séjour. L'agent affirme également que ces mesures de contrôle existent à tous les points d'entrée et de sortie des EAU. Il n'est pas contesté que les demandeurs, qui étaient des citoyens du Liban, se trouvaient dans les EAU avec des cartes de séjour au cours de la période pertinente.
[41]
Il appert des antécédents de voyage de M. Houchaime que, contrairement aux renseignements qu'il a fournis au gouvernement du Canada dans sa demande de citoyenneté, il passait effectivement la majorité de son temps à Dubaï au cours de la période pertinente et ne quittait les EAU qu'à l'occasion pour de brefs voyages à l'étranger. De plus, selon des renseignements publiquement accessibles, M. Houchaime travaillait en qualité d'administrateur délégué de Mechwatt Electromechanical Works LLC à Dubaï, ce qu'il n'a pas nié dans son affidavit.
[42]
Les défendeurs n'ont pas contesté l'exactitude et la fiabilité des antécédents de voyage fournis par les EAU. De plus, l'avocat des défendeurs a reconnu que M. Houchaime ne m'a présenté aucun élément de preuve de nature à contredire les antécédents de voyage figurant dans les dossiers des EAU à son sujet. Effectivement, M. Houchaime n'a pas nié que ses périodes de résidence au Canada indiquées dans sa demande de citoyenneté n'étaient pas exactes.
[43]
Le seul moyen de défense que M. Houchaime a invoqué, c'est une vague allégation selon laquelle il s'en est remis à son consultant canadien en immigration pour la préparation de sa demande de citoyenneté, laissant sous-entendre dans son affidavit que toute fausse déclaration importante contenue dans les demandes était imputable au consultant. M. Houchaime ajoute que les défendeurs [traduction] « ne connaissaient pas en détail le contenu des demandes de citoyenneté déposées, bien qu'ils aient signé les demandes en question sur les conseils et l'encouragement [du consultant] »: affidavit de M. Houchaime, au paragraphe 11.
[44]
M. Houchaime n'a toutefois présenté aucun élément de preuve au sujet des renseignements qu'il avait fournis au consultant relativement à ses périodes de résidence au Canada; il n'a pas expliqué non plus ce qui s'était passé pour que des renseignements manifestement erronés figurent dans sa demande.
[45]
Selon l'article 214 des
Règles des
Cours fédérales
, DORS/98-106 (les Règles), la réponse à une requête en jugement sommaire ne peut être fondée sur un élément qui pourrait être produit ultérieurement en preuve dans l'instance. Les défendeurs doivent plutôt énoncer « les faits précis et produire les éléments de preuve démontrant l'existence d'une véritable question litigieuse ». La preuve de M. Houchaime au sujet du rôle du consultant en immigration est tout à fait insatisfaisante et est loin de respecter la condition préliminaire énoncée à l'article 214 des Règles.
[46]
Qui plus est, les demandes de passeport que les membres de la famille ont remplies après avoir acquis leur citoyenneté canadienne comportent également des renseignements erronés importants quant à l'endroit où ces personnes ont vécu au cours des périodes en litige. Il n'est nullement sous-entendu dans l'affidavit de M. Houchaime que le consultant en immigration a participé d'une façon ou d'une autre à la préparation des demandes de passeport de la famille.
[47]
Étant donné que les demandes de passeport des membres de la famille ont été préparées après que ceux-ci ont acquis leur citoyenneté canadienne, elles ne sont pas directement pertinentes quant à la question de savoir si les défendeurs ont obtenu leur citoyenneté au moyen de fausses déclarations. Cependant, les inexactitudes contenues dans les demandes de passeport, qui ont toutes été signées par les défendeurs et dans lesquelles ceux-ci ont déclaré solennellement que les renseignements y figurant étaient vrais, montrent que la famille a déployé d'autres efforts pour tromper les autorités de l'immigration canadiennes quant à l'endroit où elle se trouvait au cours des périodes pertinentes.
[48]
Dans les circonstances, M. Houchaime ne m'a pas convaincue que l'action du ministre soulevait une véritable question litigieuse. Je suis convaincue qu'il a acquis sa citoyenneté canadienne au moyen de fausses déclarations contenues dans sa demande de citoyenneté, et un jugement sommaire déclarant que tel est le cas sera rendu.
[49]
Avant d'examiner la preuve concernant les trois autres membres de la famille, je souligne qu'aucun d'eux n'a présenté le moindre élément de preuve au sujet de la véracité du contenu de sa demande de citoyenneté. Il incombe à la partie visée par une requête en jugement sommaire de « présenter ses meilleurs arguments » en réponse à cette requête:
F  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 27. Cependant, les trois autres défendeurs se fondent uniquement sur l'affidavit de M. Houchaime, notamment sur l'allégation imprécise non étayée selon laquelle celui-ci s'en est remis au consultant en immigration.
C. Jacqueline El-Ksayer
[50]
Jacqueline El-Ksayer est l'épouse de M. Houchaime. Selon sa demande de citoyenneté, elle a résidé au Canada pendant 1 176 jours au cours de la période pertinente et s'est absentée du Canada à sept occasions seulement, soit pendant 133 jours au total au cours des quatre ans précédant la demande de citoyenneté qu'elle a déposée en décembre 2008.
[51]
Toutefois, il appert des antécédents de voyage que possèdent les EAU au sujet de Mme El-Ksayer qu'après avoir obtenu le droit d'établissement au Canada en août 2004, celle-ci est retournée à Dubaï le 7 septembre 2004. Le dossier révèle également qu'elle est restée aux EAU pendant la majeure partie des quatre années suivantes, sauf lorsqu'elle s'est absentée pour plusieurs courtes périodes, surtout pendant les mois d'été. Encore là, les antécédents de voyage de Mme El-Ksayer sont bien différents des renseignements que celle-ci a fournis dans sa demande de citoyenneté au sujet de sa période de résidence canadienne.
[52]
Mme El-Ksayer n'a pas nié que sa demande de citoyenneté contenait de fausses déclarations et elle ne m'a pas convaincue que la demande du ministre en vue d'obtenir un jugement déclaratoire en ce sens soulevait une véritable question litigieuse. Je suis convaincue qu'elle a acquis sa citoyenneté canadienne au moyen de fausses déclarations contenues dans sa demande de citoyenneté, et un jugement sommaire déclarant que tel est le cas sera rendu contre elle.
D. Jennifer Hochaime
[53]
Jennifer Hochaime est l'une des filles de M. Houchaime et de Mme El-Ksayer. Même si elle était enfant à son arrivée au Canada, elle était devenue majeure à la date à laquelle elle a signé sa demande de citoyenneté canadienne le 25 septembre 2008.
[54]
Dans sa demande de citoyenneté, Jennifer déclare qu'elle a résidé au Canada pendant 1 126 jours au cours de la période pertinente et qu'elle s'est absentée du Canada à trois occasions seulement pour un total de 134 jours au cours des quatre ans précédant sa demande de citoyenneté.
[55]
Cependant, les antécédents de voyage que possèdent les EAU au sujet de Jennifer révèlent qu'après avoir obtenu le droit d'établissement au Canada en août 2004 elle est retournée peu après à Dubaï le 7 septembre 2004 et y est restée jusqu'au 16 juillet 2005. Elle a quitté Dubaï pour deux ou trois semaines au cours de l'été 2005 et y est retournée le 13 août 2005. L'histoire s'est ensuite répétée: Jennifer est restée à Dubaï entre août 2005 et juillet 2006 et un séjour semblable a eu lieu en 2007.
[56]
Les voyages que Jennifer a faits concordent avec le profil d'une personne qui fréquente l'école à Dubaï. Cependant, il ne s'agit pas là d'un simple soupçon de ma part. La preuve non contestée que le ministre a présentée montre que Jennifer a effectivement fréquenté l'Emirates Academy of Hospitality Management d'octobre 2004 à juillet 2008. Dans le cadre des études qu'elle a poursuivies à l'académie, Jennifer a participé, de janvier 2007 à novembre 2007, à un programme d'échange à l'École hôtelière de Lausanne, en Suisse, puis est retournée de nouveau à Dubaï.
[57]
Le ministre a produit une attestation écrite dans laquelle ces deux institutions confirment que Jennifer était physiquement présente à leur établissement au cours des périodes en question. Or, il s'agit de périodes au cours desquelles Jennifer était censée résider au Canada, selon sa demande de citoyenneté.
[58]
Encore là, Jennifer n'a pas contesté cette preuve de façon significative. En conséquence, elle ne m'a pas convaincue que l'action du ministre soulevait une véritable question litigieuse. Je suis convaincue que Jennifer Hochaime a acquis sa citoyenneté canadienne à l'aide des faux renseignements contenus dans sa demande de citoyenneté, et un jugement sommaire portant que tel est le cas sera rendu contre elle.
E. Lynn Hochaime
[59]
Lynn Hochaime est l'autre fille de M. Houchaime et de Mme El-Ksayer. À l'instar de sa sœur Jennifer, Lynn était enfant à son arrivée au Canada, mais elle était devenue majeure lorsqu'elle a signé sa demande de citoyenneté canadienne le 18 mars 2008.
[60]
Dans sa demande de citoyenneté, Lynn déclare qu'elle a résidé au Canada pendant 1 222 jours au cours de la période pertinente et qu'elle s'est absentée du Canada à trois occasions seulement pour un total de 87 jours au cours des quatre ans précédant la date à laquelle elle a signé sa demande de citoyenneté.
[61]
Cependant, les antécédents de voyage que les EAU possèdent au sujet de Jennifer montrent qu'après avoir obtenu le droit d'établissement au Canada en août 2004 elle est retournée à Dubaï le 7 septembre 2004, soit la date à laquelle sa sœur et sa mère sont également retournées aux EAU. Lynn est restée à Dubaï pendant la majeure partie des quatre années suivantes et n'a fait que de courts voyages à l'extérieur du pays, surtout pendant les mois d'été.
[62]
Encore là, les voyages que Lynn a faits concordent avec le profil d'une personne qui a fréquenté l'école aux EAU. D'ailleurs, le ministre a obtenu des éléments de preuve montrant qu'elle fréquentait effectivement l'école secondaire, plus précisément l'école Al Mawakeb à Dubaï, jusqu'à ce qu'elle obtienne son diplôme de cet établissement en 2007.
[63]
Selon la demande de citoyenneté de Lynn, celle-ci aurait commencé à fréquenter la McMaster University à Hamilton (Ontario) en septembre 2006. Cependant, les renseignements que le ministre a obtenus de cette université montrent qu'elle n'a commencé à fréquenter cet établissement qu'en septembre 2008, lequel fait est confirmé par le propre profil de Lynn sur le site « LinkedIn ».
[64]
À l'instar des trois autres membres de la famille, Lynn n'a pas contesté de façon significative la preuve présentée contre elle. En conséquence, elle ne m'a pas convaincue que l'action du ministre soulevait une véritable question litigieuse. Je suis convaincue que Lynn Hochaime a acquis sa citoyenneté canadienne au moyen des faux renseignements contenus dans sa demande de citoyenneté, et un jugement sommaire déclarant que tel est le cas sera rendu contre elle.
VII. Y a-t-il lieu de rendre un jugement sommaire à l'égard de la demande reconventionnelle des défendeurs?
[65]
Le ministre sollicite également un jugement sommaire rejetant la demande reconventionnelle des défendeurs. Comme je l'explique ci-dessous, je suis d'avis qu'il y a également lieu de rendre un jugement sommaire au sujet de la demande reconventionnelle, aucun défendeur n'ayant démontré l'existence d'une question litigieuse à cet égard.
[66]
Dans leur demande reconventionnelle, les défendeurs font valoir que l'article 10, l'alinéa 18(1)
b
) et le paragraphe 18(3) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
sont incompatibles avec l'article 7 de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
et vont à l'encontre de leur droit à la liberté.
[67]
La citoyenneté canadienne est un privilège précieux (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), et l'enjeu est sans doute très important pour les défendeurs. Néanmoins, il faut se rappeler que le ministre tente dans la présente instance de priver les défendeurs de leur citoyenneté, et
non
de leur liberté. Effectivement, les défendeurs n'ont pas expliqué en quoi leur droit à la liberté était en jeu en l'espèce.
[68]
De plus, les défendeurs ont reconnu que la Cour d'appel fédérale [traduction] « a[vait] constamment décidé que l'article 7 de la Charte ne s'appliqu[ait] pas aux demandes d'annulation présentées devant la Cour fédérale », faisant valoir que celle-ci devrait toutefois [traduction] « réexaminer ces questions à la lumière des faits et des arguments » qu'ils ont invoqués: mémoire des faits et du droit des défendeurs, au paragraphe 17.
[69]
La Cour d'appel fédérale a effectivement affirmé en toutes lettres que les procédures d'annulation de la citoyenneté ne soulevaient pas de questions liées à l'article 7 de la Charte: voir, par exemple, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité.
[70]
Il est indéniable qu'il n'est pas loisible à la Cour fédérale de réexaminer les décisions contraignantes de la Cour d'appel fédérale. De plus, même si la Cour fédérale pouvait faire ce réexamen, en l'absence d'explication quant à la façon dont la procédure d'annulation touche les droits que l'article 7 leur reconnaît en l'espèce, les défendeurs n'ont tout simplement établi
aucun
fondement au soutien de leur demande relative à l'article 7 de la Charte et aucune question litigieuse n'a été soulevée à cet égard.
[71]
En conséquence, une ordonnance portant rejet de la demande reconventionnelle des défendeurs sera rendue.
VIII. Les dépens
[72]
En raison de la nature et de la portée des fausses déclarations des défendeurs, le ministre devrait avoir droit aux dépens sur une base avocat-client dans la présente instance.
