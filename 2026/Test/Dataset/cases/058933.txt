Gibson, J.
: The applicants seek the following relief:
(1) judicial review of the decision of James Lynn, Consul, as set out in his letter dated July 6, 1992, which decision was made on behalf of the respondents and which was received by the solicitor for the applicants on July 13, 1992;
(2) a writ of certiorari, quashing the decision;
(3) a writ of mandamus compelling the respondents to process the application of Yun Jing Jim for permanent residence status in Canada in the retired category pursuant to the selection criteria set out in section 8(1)(e) of the
Immigration Rules
, 1978;
(4) a writ of mandamus compelling the respondents to process the application of Wong Kwai-See (Joanna) for permanent residence status in Canada in the dependant category;
(5) costs of the application.
[2]
The decision under review, as indicated above, is contained in a letter dated the 6th day of July, 1992, from James Lynn, Consul in the Canadian Consulate General, Seattle, Washington. The letter is addressed to Yun Jing (the "principal applicant"). The substance of the letter reads as follows:
"This letter refers to your application for permanent residence in Canada. I have now completed the assessment of your application to Canada in the retired category.
"We have received the results of your medical examination which indicate that, amongst other things, in December 1991, you were treated for the condition of malignant neoplasm of the bronchus. It is the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer that the signs and symptoms of your condition are likely to recur.
"I regret to inform you that you are a member of the inadmissible class of persons described in s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
, in that you are a person who is suffering from a disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer, your admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services.
"I have considered the proposal of your lawyer, Mr. Paul Leung, made in his letter dated May 6, 1992, that, if granted landing, you would waive your entitlement to claim medical benefits in Canada and enter into a contract with the Minister of Employment and Immigration, Canada under which you would be '... estopped in making any claim against any medical plans under any provinces'. This proposal cannot be accepted for reasons including the following.
"If you were granted permanent residence in Canada you would be entitled to full access to medical treatment in your province of residence pursuant to the provisions of the Canada
Health Act
.
"The Minister has no authority under the
Immigration Act
and the
Immigration Regulations
to impose conditions on your admission to Canada as a permanent residence which are of the nature as those suggested by your counsel.
"Terms and conditions on a grant of landing may be imposed pursuant to s. 14(2)(a) of the
Immigration Act
, which indicates that:
'(2) Where an immigration officer is satisfied that it would not be contrary to this Act or the regulations to grant landing to an immigrant whom the officer has examined, the officer shall
(a) grant landing to that immigrant, in which case the officer may impose terms and conditions of a prescribed nature.'
"Section 23 of the
Immigration Regulations
prescribes those terms and conditions which may be imposed and does not allow for the imposition of terms and conditions relating to the restriction of claims against provincial medical plans.
"I must also advise you that your dependant daughter, Wong Kwai-See (Joanna), is also inadmissible to Canada by virtue of s. 19(2)(c) of the
Immigration Act
, which indicates that:
'No immigrant and, except as provided in subsection (3), no visitor shall be granted admission if the immigrant or visitor is a member of any of the following classes:
(c) other members of a family accompanying a member of that family who may not be granted admission or who is not otherwise authorized to come to Canada.'"
[3]
The substance of the last quoted paragraph relating to the applicant Wong Kwai-See (Joanna) was not disputed before me. Her application to be admitted to Canada is entirely dependent on the outcome with respect to the principal applicant's application.
[4]
Equally, no issue was taken before me with regard to Mr. Lynn's decision regarding the proposal on behalf of the principal applicant to waive entitlement to claim medical benefits in Canada if granted landing.
[5]
The facts are as follows.
[6]
The principal applicant applied for landing in Canada under the provisions of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2 (the
Act
) in the retired category (The "retired category" no longer exists but it is not disputed that it existed at all times that are here relevant. The principal applicant met the requirements of the category.) She suffers from a serious medical condition. As indicated, in Mr. Lynn's letter, in December, 1991, she was surgically treated for malignant neoplasm of the bronchus. On the basis of the principal applicant's medical condition, Mr. Lynn rejected her application pursuant to section 19(1) of the
Act
.
[7]
The relevant portions of section 19(1) of the
Act
read as follows at all times relevant to this application:
"19(1) No person shall be granted admission who is a member of any of the following classes:
(a) persons who are suffering from any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer,
. . . . .
(ii) their admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services;"
[8]
Section 22 of the
Immigration Regulations
1978 S.O.R./78-72, (the "
Regulations
") reads as follows:
"22 For the purpose of determining whether any person is or is likely to be a danger to public health or to public safety or whether the admission of any person would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services, the following factors shall be considered by a medical officer in relation to the nature, severity or probable duration of any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment from which the person is suffering, namely,
(a) any reports made by a medical practitioner with respect to the person;
(b) the degree to which the disease, disorder, disability or other impairment may be communicated to other persons;
(c) whether medical surveillance is required for reasons of public health;
(d) whether sudden incapacity or unpredictable or unusual behaviour may create a danger to public safety;
(e) whether the supply of health or social services that the person may require in Canada is limited to such an extent that
(i) the use of such services by the person might reasonably be expected to prevent or delay provision of those services to Canadian citizens or permanent residents, or
(ii) the use of such services may not be available or accessible to the person;
(f) whether medical care or hospitalization is required;
(g) whether potential employability or productivity is affected; and
(h) whether prompt and effective medical treatment can be provided."
[9]
Prior to the date of Mr. Lynn's letter, a "Medical Notification to Employment and Immigration Commission" was in hand (Affidavit of James F.P. Lynn sworn the 18th day of September, 1992, and filed the 25th day of September, 1992; Exhibit "E".) as contemplated by section 19(1) of the
Act
and section 22 of the
Regulations
. It was provided by Dr. L. Panneton and concurred in by Dr. J. Saint-Germain as "Reviewing Medical Officer". It provided as follows: "In the opinion of the undersigned medical officers, the applicant is suffering from a disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which: his/her admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services." The quoted text is printed on what appears to be a standard form and for all intents and purposes simply repeats the terminology of the relevant parts of section 19(1) of the
Act
. In a place on the form entitled "Narrative" the following amplification is provided:
"This woman was surgically treated in December 1991 for malignant neoplasm of the bronchus. This is likely to recur. She will require specialized medical services and recurrent hospitalizations. She will therefore make excessive demands on health services and she is considered inadmissible under section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Canada
Immigration Act
."
[10]
The form is dated the 30th day of March, 1992.
[11]
The form provides no indication on its face that the range of factors set out in section 22 of the
Regulations
were considered. Affidavits of the medical doctors sworn and filed the 24th day of September, 1992, in the case of Dr. Panneton and sworn and filed the 25th day of September, 1992, in the case of Dr. Saint-Germain provide more indication as to how the advice was arrived at in identical paragraphs in the following terms:
"5. I considered the following material and information:
(i) a) the Diagnostix Pathology Laboratories Ltd. report dated 1992-01-02, a true copy of which is attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'A' to this my affidavit;
b) Medical Reports required of all applicants for immigration to Canada, true copies of which are attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'B' to this my affidavit;
c) A true copy of the relevant Guidelines contained in the Medical Officer's Handbook are attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'C' to this my affidavit;
d) A true copy of the Outline of Basic Medical Criteria contained in the Employment and Immigration Canada Immigration Manual is attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'D' to this my affidavit;
e) A true copy of all the factors listed in section 22 of the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978, SOR/78-172, as amended (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Regulations
'), are attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'E' to this my affidavit.
ii) After considering the above information and material, it was my opinion, that the applicant was suffering from the disease of cancer and as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which, her admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services. I concluded that the applicant was a member of the class of medically inadmissible persons described in section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Act
.
iii) Communication of this opinion and conclusion was made to the Visa Officer by way of a Medical Notification dated March 30, 1992, a true copy of which is attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'F' to this my affidavit."
[12]
In support of this application, the principal applicant filed an affidavit to which was annexed a letter from a Dr. Ng Hin Kwong of Hong Kong, dated the 13th day of February, 1992 in which he concluded with the opinion that the principal applicant "... should be considered to be cured and her prognosis is good". Counsel for the respondent objects to any reliance on this opinion on the basis of rule 332(1) of the
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 663. Rule 332(1) reads as follows:
"332(1) Affidavits shall be confined to such facts as the witness is able of his own knowledge to prove, except on interlocutory motions on which statements as to his belief with the grounds thereof may be admitted."
While I find the objection to be well founded, that finding is not critical to my decision.
[13]
All relevant material referred to above, including in particular, the opinion of Dr. Ng Hin Kwong, was further reviewed by two additional medical doctors. They concurred in the opinion of Dr. Panneton and Dr. Saint-Germain. The affidavit of Dr. Brian Weinerman sworn and filed the 25th day of September, 1991, is of particular interest. In paragraphs 6 to 8 of his affidavit he avers:
"6. The probable recurrence of the symptoms of cancer in a person in the applicant's condition would cause excessive demands on health services. The probable use of health services by a person such as the applicant might reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the provision of those services to Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
"7. My knowledge of the availability of health services for patients who have a significant recurrence of the symptoms of cancer is that it is generally quite expensive to provide health services to cancer patients who require treatment for significant recurrences of cancer. Treatment for a significant recurrence of the symptoms of cancer might, in a person in the applicant's condition, reasonably be expected to involve the extensive provision of various health services.
"8. The supply of health services for patients in the applicant's condition in Canada are limited to the extent that not all Canadian citizens or permanent residents who seek necessary cancer treatment are able to obtain necessary treatment as quickly as is needed. Some cancer patients in Canada who are in the applicant's condition must undergo a significant waiting period at present in order to obtain necessary treatment."
[14]
Dr. Weinerman's qualifications to provide the foregoing information under oath, as recited in his affidavit, are impressive.
Analysis
[15]
Counsel for the applicant stated the issue before me in the following terms: "The issue is whether the opinion of the Medical Officers was reasonable (Application Record, P. 287). Despite his very able argument, I conclude that the opinion of the Medical Officers was reasonable. The affidavit evidence provided by the Medical Officers clearly addresses the criteria in the paragraphs of section 22 of the
Regulations
(quoted above) that are relevant. Reports made by medical practitioners with respect to the principal applicant, including that of Dr. Ng Hin Kwong, were considered (section 22(a)). Sections 22(b) to (d) and (g) do not appear to be relevant. Paragraph 6 of Dr. Weinerman's affidavit quoted above reflects the terminology of section 22(e) of the
Regulations
. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the same affidavit elaborate on the conclusions reached in paragraph 6. Medical care and hospitalization (section 22(f)) and the issue of prompt effective medical treatment (section 22(h)) are once again addressed in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Weinerman affidavit.
[16]
There remains the question of whether the demands on health or social services that might reasonably be expected to flow from the admission of the principal applicant would be "excessive", that being the term used in section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Act
. Counsel for the applicant argued that "excessive" should be interpreted as "unreasonable" or beyond what the system reasonably provides to everyone. This is not inconsistent with one of the meanings assigned to the word "excessive" by the
Oxford Dictionary of Current English
(R.E. Allen, ed., Oxford University Press, 1991) which was cited by counsel for the respondents, that being "... more than what is normal or necessary". Against the relevant criteria set out in section 22 of the
Regulations
, and in the light of the opinions of Medical Officers that are before me, particularly that of Dr. Weinerman, I conclude that the admission of the principal applicant would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause more than what is normal, that is to say excessive, demands on health or social services in Canada.
Conclusion
[17]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 14, Stone, J.A., of the Federal Court of Appeal, speaking as a member of the majority of the justices who considered that case, had the following to say:
"An examination of the cases decided in this court suggests that a medical notification which is inconsistent to the point of incoherence, or which is expressed in terms of possibility rather than probability will be regarded as deficient from a legal standpoint ...; that the immigration authorities concerned may properly act upon their assessment of the medical notification provided it is not tainted by any misconception of the law or any patently erroneous understanding of the opinion expressed by the medical officers ...; and that the Board may receive evidence additional to that contained in the medical notification in relation to whether the opinion therein expressed was reasonable at the time it was given and relied upon by the immigration authorities in disposing of the application for admission ..." (citations deleted)
[18]
On the basis of the facts of this case, of my analysis of the evidence and the arguments before me, and the foregoing summary of decided cases, I find no basis to interfere with the decision of Consul James Lynn which is before me.
[19]
Accordingly, I have dismissed the application for judicial review.
[20]
Both the applicant and respondent requested costs of the application in the written material filed. Rule 1618 of the
Federal Court Rules
provides that no costs shall be payable in respect of an application for judicial review unless the court, for special reasons, so orders. I find no special reasons that would justify an order as to costs of this application.
Application dismissed.
