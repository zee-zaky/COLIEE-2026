Teitelbaum, J.
: This is an application against the plaintiffs Titan Linkabit Corporation, Cable/Home Communication Corp., General Instrument Corporation, First Choice Canadian Communication Corporation (hereinafter referred to as Titan, Cable/Home, G.I. and First Choice) to show cause why they should not be found guilty of contempt of court for breaching various orders of the court. I say various orders of the court, as in its notice of application, the defendants, under the title "The Grounds of the Application are that" speaks of failing to retain "in their custody" articles and documents, failing to make lists and failing to return originals as well as breaching a confidentiality order. In para. 7, under the grounds of the application, defendants state:
"7. Both plaintiffs' solicitors and employees of the plaintiff General Instrument Corporation participated in carrying out the Anton Pillar Order and have placed themselves in breach of the above undertakings and/or are in contempt of this court by:
i) failing to make a complete list of the articles and documents seized. No accurate count of circuit boards and microprocessor parts was taken. Subsequent estimates vary from 'over 250' to 450 circuit boards alone. At least one proprietary computer program (F load) is missing and unaccounted for.
ii) not returning the originals of the documents within ten working days. The defendants were required to obtain a court order that the documents be returned, which was complied with only after the plaintiffs' solicitors had made copies in violation of Mr. Justice Walsh's order dated January 22, 1991.
iii) delivering an unknown quantity of the circuit boards, microprocessor parts and other information to the plaintiffs without first obtaining an order of this court."
[2]
The undertakings, according to the defendants are:
"1. The plaintiffs obtained an order to enter the defendants' premises and to seize evidence of alleged infringement of its copyrights and patents (an Anton Pillar Order) upon undertaking to abide by any order this court may make as to damages which the defendants may sustain by reason of that order and upon the plaintiffs' solicitors undertaking to do certain things including:
i) to retain in their safe custody until further order all articles and documents taken or delivered to them;
ii) to make a list of all such articles and documents obtained prior to removal; and
iii) to return the originals of all documents obtained within ten working days."
[3]
At the hearing, counsel for defendants informed the court that he is abandoning the alleged breach found in para. 7(ii).
[4]
There were many proceedings initiated in this case and I believe it necessary, for a better understanding, to state in detail the orders of the court leading up to the present proceeding.
[5]
On January 21, 1991, the plaintiffs presented an ex parte application for an Anton Pillar Order to Mr. Justice Dubé. On that date, Mr. Justice Dubé issued the following order:
"1. The defendants, and each of them, and as regards the defendants S.E.E. See Electronic Engineering Inc., Dectec International Inc. and Sunset Technology Inc. whether by directors or servants or each and/or any of them or otherwise howsoever, shall be restrained until the hearing of an interlocutory injunction or further order of this court in this action from doing the following acts:
(a) directly or indirectly informing or notifying any person, company or firm of the existence of these proceedings or the provision of this order of the plaintiffs or otherwise warning any person, company or firm that proceedings may be brought against them by the plaintiffs otherwise than for the purposes of seeking legal advice from their lawyers;
(b) from infringing copyright in plaintiffs' copyright works VideoCipher
*
Key Index, CMS 2.4 and Crypto Code;
(c) from infringing Canadian Patent numbers 1229909; 1242793; 1264848; and 1225458;
(d) distributing, offering for sale or selling any device or devices for the unauthorized reception and utilization of scrambled VideoCipher
*
telecommunication signals for the purposes of receiving broadcast signals from plaintiff First Choice;
"2. Defendants do disclose forthwith to the persons serving this order upon them;
(a) the whereabouts of all devices and materials which are enjoined pursuant to parag. 1 hereof and which are in their possession, custody, power or control;
(b) to the best of the defendants' knowledge and belief (i) the names and addresses of all persons who have supplies or offered to supply them with the devices and materials referred to in 1, (ii) the names and addresses of all persons to whom they have supplied or offered to supply any or such articles or materials and (iii) full details of the dates and quantities of each offer to supply referred to in (i) and (ii) hereof;
"3. The defendants do deliver forthwith to the plaintiffs' solicitors all articles or materials which are in their possession, custody or power and if any such item exists in computer readable form only the defendants shall additionally cause it to forthwith be printed out and deliver the printout to the plaintiffs' solicitors or failing a printer, to be displayed in a readable form;
"4. The defendants and each of them whether by themselves or by any person appearing to be in control of the premises hereafter mentioned do permit the persons serving this order upon them and such other persons duly authorized by the plaintiffs not to exceed four (4) in number all together, to enter forthwith at any time between 9 o'clock in the morning and 7 o'clock in the evening or so long thereafter as may be required for the purposes of executing this order, the premises known as 1962 Mills Road, Sydney, British Columbia, 34314 Marshall Road, Abbotsford, British Columbia, 3487 Auchinachie Road, Box 711, Municipality of Duncan, British Columbia, and 2424 Dickson Road, Sooke, British Columbia, and any other premises or vehicles to the extent that any of the said vehicles or premises are in the power, possession, occupation or control of the defendants for the purposes of looking for, inspecting, photographing and taking into custody of the plaintiffs' solicitors all items and materials referred to in para. 2 above or which appear to the plaintiffs' solicitors to be such items or materials.
"5. The defendants may apply before the court to vary or discharge this order at any time, on twenty-four hours notice to the solicitors for the plaintiffs, together with service upon the solicitors for the plaintiffs of any supporting material to be relied upon in connection with the application."
(Tab 17, Federal Court Orders in Issue)
[6]
On the very next day, January 22, 1991, and I assume while the order of Mr. Justice Dubé was being carried out, or immediately thereafter, counsel for defendants appeared before Mr. Justice Walsh with an ex parte application and obtained the following order:
"It Is Hereby Ordered:
"That the solicitors for the plaintiffs hereby be restrained from copying, distributing or otherwise disseminating to any person, including the plaintiffs, information or documents obtained by executing the order pronounced by Mr. Justice Dubé on January 21, 1991 until close of business on Monday, January 28, 1991 or further order of this court;
"And This Court Further Orders that the defendants' application to vary or discharge the order of Mr. Justice Dubé pronounced January 21, 1991 be returnable on Monday, January 28, 1991 before D.J. Allison A.M. Walsh."
(Tab 16, Federal Court Orders in Issue)
[7]
According to counsel for defendants, this was done because defendants were most fearful that highly confidential information would be given to the plaintiffs which would cause defendants severe harm.
[8]
On January 30, 1991, after a hearing on the defendants' application to set aside the order of Mr. Justice Dubé or in the alternative to vary his order, Mr. Justice Walsh issued the following order:
"1. The first alternative by defendants in the motion before me to set aside the order of Justice Dubé on January 21, 1991 is dismissed.
"2. The alternative conclusion is granted in part only.
(a) The Anton Pillar Order as modified by my order of January 22, 1991 shall remain in effect until set aside by a judgment of this court.
(b) Plaintiffs' solicitors shall deliver to defendants' solicitors documents seized in order for the latter to make photocopies of same, retaining the originals and delivering the photocopies to the plaintiffs' solicitors upon the granting of a confidentiality order the terms of which are to be agreed on by the parties or settled by the court.
(c) The injunction in para. 1(d) of the order of Justice Dubé shall remain in effect only until the hearing of the interlocutory injunction, set for hearing in Montreal on February 1, 1991 at which date the presiding judge can consider whether to remove it in part on the terms proposed by defendants or such other terms as he may fix, or to continue it until the application for interlocutory injunction has been disposed of."
(Tab 15, Federal Court Orders in Issue)
[9]
In his reasons, Mr. Justice Walsh, in speaking of his January 22, 1991 order and why he issued same, states:
"The reason for the modification is that defendants allege that among the documents seized was a disk containing computer memory developed by them of a highly confidential nature and that its disclosure to plaintiffs would assist them in developing a similar program which they are allegedly developing by use of this confidential information. It was argued that it would be an abuse of the Anton Pillar procedure to permit it to be used so as to obtain confidential information from defendants."
(Page 24, Federal Court Orders in Issue)
[10]
What is of particular significance in these reasons are the following remarks of Mr. Justice Walsh as it relates to the descrambler units:
"Certain other matters were agreed upon, however, on which some modification of the order might be usefully made. Defendants, based their contention that to seize all their descrambler units and prevent the sale of them would effectively put them out of business as they operate on a cash basis with limited capital.
They offer to permit plaintiffs to retain and inspect up to a dozen of them
, provided the balance are released to defendants for sale. They undertake in lieu of security to deposit $25 from each such sale in a trust account to be disposed of when the proceedings are terminated if judgment is rendered in favour of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs for their part allege that this is equivalent to permitting them to continue their infringing conduct on payment of a fee for each sale, and also that plaintiffs are well responsible for any damages incurred by defendants by improper prevention of such sales, if that is the outcome of the matter. I believe that this is a matter which should be properly dealt with on the hearing of the injunction proceedings, which should not, however, be unduly delayed." (Underlining is mine)
(Pages 24 and 25, Federal Court Orders in Issue)
[11]
The reason I state that this is significant is that counsel for defendants in presenting his case bases his case
almost entirely
on the fact that counsel for plaintiffs breached their undertaking in that they allowed plaintiffs to obtain 24 of the descrambler units (SUN units) for inspection.
[12]
I find this difficult to comprehend. If the defendants
offered to permit plaintiffs to retain and inspect
up to a dozen of the units, I do not now understand the great significance of the fact that plaintiffs had 24 units to inspect.
[13]
Be that as it may, on February 13, 1991, Mr. Justice Joyal issued the following lengthy and detailed order:
"1. All confidential documents and other confidential material that are produced by a party hereto may be designated 'Confidential' or 'Confidential, Subject To Confidentiality Order'. All such documents and other material so designated shall be retained in confidence by receiving counsel, and shall not be used for any purpose other than this action. A party shall not be obligated to challenge the propriety of a 'Confidential' designation at the time made, and a failure to do so shall not preclude a subsequent challenge thereto.
"2. The inadvertent or unintentional disclosure by the supplying party of confidential information, regardless of whether the information was so designated at the time of disclosure, shall not be deemed to waive in whole or in part of a party's claim of confidentiality, either as to the specific information disclosed or as to any other information relating thereto or on the same related subject matter.
"3. All information that is not reduced to documentary, tangible, or physical form, or that cannot conveniently be designated in a manner set forth in Para. 1 of the Confidentiality Order, shall be treated as 'Confidential' by the parties during the period of fifteen (15) days immediately following production of such information, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, and the supplying party has fifteen (15) days in which to designate such information, that has at all times been maintained confidential, as 'Confidential'. Unless the supplying party designates such information 'Confidential' by so informing the receiving party in writing within the aforementioned 15-day period, such information shall be treated as nonconfidential after the end of such period.
"4. All transcripts and all oral communications between the parties conveying business or technical information in the course of discovery or cross-examination are to be treated as 'Confidential' in their entirety by the parties during a period of fifteen (15) days immediately following receipt of such transcripts or communications, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Such transcripts or communications shall be treated as nonconfidential after the end of such period, unless designated 'Confidential' by indicating on the record at the deposition, or in writing within the fifteen (15) day period after the disclosure of any such confidential information, and, in that event, the information shall thereafter be maintained confidential. A party designating information disclosed at a disposition as 'Confidential' must notify all the parties in writing, within the aforementioned 15-day period, of the specific pages and lines of the transcript that contain confidential information. Any portions of a transcript that have been so designated as 'Confidential' shall be so marked and maintained separate from the remainder of the transcript.
"5. Confidential documents and other confidential material and confidential information received from an opposing party, that have been designated 'Confidential', shall not be disclosed by counsel, including in-house counsel, to any third parties, or his client; excepting those individuals listed in Exhibit 'A'. However, solely for the purposes of this action, any such designated material may be disclosed by counsel to his staff and support personnel, the individuals listed in Exhibit 'A' and to a reasonable number of persons (hereinafter 'disclosees'), which disclosees have been requested by counsel to furnish assistance with respect to the subject matter thereof or for the trial of this action. Such disclosees shall execute a declaration in the form of Exhibit 'B' hereto prior to receiving or reviewing any information designated as 'Confidential' and receiving counsel shall promptly transmit each such declaration to the supplier of the confidential information. The supplier of the confidential information shall then have ten (10) days following receipt of such declaration to object in writing and thereby prohibit the proposed disclosure. The receiving party shall disclose confidential information to the disclosee only after the expiration of the above-mentioned 10-day period, or as otherwise agreed in writing between the parties.
"6. A party may, without waiver of confidentiality, produce for inspection confidential documents and other confidential material prior to marking them 'Confidential', provided that any copies of such documents and other material eventually provided to the inspecting party are marked 'Confidential' in either manner set forth above in paragraph 1 of this Confidentiality order. In the event the producing party is making such documents and/or material available for inspection prior to marking them 'Confidential', it shall so advise the inspecting party, and any such inspection shall be limited to those persons authorized to review confidential documents and other confidential material that have been designated as 'Confidential', pursuant to the terms of this Confidentiality Order.
"7. All documents and other material that are filed with the court in this action that have been designated 'Confidential' shall be marked as such by the filing party and shall be filed in a sealed envelope on which shall be endorsed the title of this action, the words 'Confidential, Subject To Confidentiality Order', and a statement substantially in the following form: 'This envelope containing (identity the general nature of documents and/or material e.g., transcripts, discovery responses, etc.) which is filed in this case by (name of party), is not to be opened nor the contents thereof to be displayed or revealed except by order of the court'. The filing party shall specifically identify the 'Confidential' portions of such documents or materials. The clerk of this court is directed to maintain under seal such portions of documents and material submitted to the court in the action that have been so designated, but shall otherwise have access to such documents as required for processing purposes.
"8. The restrictions set forth in the Confidentiality Order shall not apply to any document or other material or information that, prior to disclosure, (a) is in the possession or knowledge of the party to whom such disclosures is made, or (b) is public knowledge, or (c) after disclosure, becomes public knowledge other than by act or omission of the party to whom such disclosure is made, or (d) is independently developed or that is legitimately acquired from an independent source provided, however, that if either party believes any document or other material or information should not be deemed confidential because of the circumstances set forth above, or any other circumstances, such party shall have the burden of proving same and must first notify opposing counsel, providing counsel with then (1) days to object. If an objection is made, the document or other material or information shall be considered subject to this Confidentiality Order until permission of the court is given to treat it otherwise.
"9. Within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of this action, all 'Confidential' documents and other material, and copies thereof, shall be returned to the producing counsel for the other party, or shall be otherwise disposed of in a manner agreeable to both parties, or as otherwise ordered by the court.
"10. Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Confidentiality Order shall be deemed to preclude any party from seeking and obtaining, on an appropriate showing, additional protection with respect to the confidentiality of documents or other material or information, or relief from this Confidentiality Order with respect to particular documents or other material or information designated hereunder as 'Confidential' or relief from this Confidentiality Order with respect to objections of opposing counsel to the disclosure of confidential information to a particular disclosee.
"11. Nothing in this Confidentiality Order shall bar or otherwise restrict any lawyer herein from rendering advice to his client with respect to this lawsuit and in the course thereof, referring to or relying upon his examination of confidential documents or other confidential material or information; provided, however, that in rendering such advice and in otherwise communicating with his client, the lawyer shall not disclose the content or the source of any confidential documents or other confidential material or information to anyone not authorized to receive such documents, material or information pursuant to the terms of this Confidentiality Order.
"12. This Confidentiality Order supersedes any previous arrangement for confidentiality entered into by the parties of their counsel, and shall apply to any confidential documents and other confidential material and confidential information previously disclosed that have been designated confidential.
"13. This court retains jurisdiction of the parties hereto indefinitely respecting any dispute between them concerning this Confidentiality Order. Either party may apply to the court on short notice for direction."
[14]
On February 6, 1992, approximately one year after the order of the Mr. Justice Joyal, I issued a Show Cause Order upon an ex parte application by the defendant.
[15]
The following admissions on behalf of plaintiffs was filed by the plaintiffs, through their solicitors, as Exhibit 3:
"1. Eric Sprunk, an engineer for General Instrument Corporation, filed affidavits in support of the application for an interlocutory injunction and was cross-examined on his affidavits. The transcript of the examination is entitled 'Examination for Discovery of Eric Sprunk', and is dated Monday, January 20, 1992. Following that examination, on March 26, 1991, Stephen Hamilton of the law firm of Stikeman, Elliot submitted answers to outstanding questions from that examination. The plaintiffs agree for the purposes of the contempt hearing to the evidence contained in the affidavits of Eric Sprunk, cross-examinations and the answers to the outstanding questions.
"2. Roy Griffin submitted an affidavit in the interlocutory injunction proceedings. He was cross-examined on that affidavit on the 16th and 17th of January, 1992. Stephen Hamilton of the law firm of Stikeman, Elliot wrote to the solicitors for the defendants on March 26, 1992 and provided answers to outstanding questions from the Griffin cross-examinations. Stephen Hamilton of the law firm of Stikeman, Elliot wrote to the solicitors for the defendants on April 1, 1992 enclosing corrections to the transcripts of the cross-examination of Roy Griffin. The plaintiffs agree for the purposes of the contempt hearing to the evidence contained in the affidavits of Roy Griffin, cross-examinations and the answers to the outstanding questions.
"3. Stuart C. McCormack of the law firm of Stikeman, Elliot attended at the premises of Dectec International Inc. and S.E.E. See Electronic Engineering Inc. at 1962 Mills Road in Sydney, British Columbia on January 22, 1991 to execute an Anton Pillar Order. Mr. McCormack remained there executing the Anton Pillar Order from approximately one o'clock until 7 p.m. on that date.
"4. Eric Sprunk, security engineering manager, of General Instrument and Cable/Home Communication Corp. accompanied Mr. Stuart McCormack of Stikeman, Elliot on January 22, 1991 and joined in the search and the execution of the Anton Pillar Order. Eric Sprunk has been an employee of the plaintiff General Instrument Corporation since August 20, 1990 and has remained an employee of that company at all material times.
"5. At 4 o'clock on January 22, 1991 the residence of Norman Dick was searched pursuant to the Anton Pillar Order and a copy was made of files contained in his computer.
"6. After the material was seized from the defendants, it was boxed and transported in vans for storage at the Vancouver office of Stikeman, Elliot.
"7. Mr. Roy Griffin was identified on April 19, 1991 by plaintiffs as being a disclosee who executed an agreement pursuant to Exhibit B of the Confidentiality Order.
"8. On or about May 10, 1991 Roy Griffin received the information set out in his affidavit, which information is now being claimed as confidential.
"9. On May 21, 1991, 23 SUN units were sent to General Instrument Corporation in San Diego and information was extracted from the 23 SUN units. No notice was given to the solicitors for the defendants.
"10. At all times Stikeman, Elliot was acting with the full knowledge and consent of plaintiffs.
"11. The letter attached herewith from Xilinks to Marvin Blecker of General Instrument Corporation dated November 14, 1990 is admitted to be a true copy of a letter sent by Bernard Vonderschmitt to Marvin Blecker on or about the date of November 14, 1990 and was received by Marvin Blecker in response to an enquiry by General Instruments regarding the Xlinks product manufactured for Dectec."
[16]
The defendants called four witnesses. The plaintiffs did not call any witnesses.
[17]
Defendants called Norman Dick, an electronics engineer in good standing with the Association of Professional Engineers of Alberta. Mr. Dick is or was, to April 6, 1992, an employee of the defendant S.E.E. or Dectec as a research engineer on a consulting basis. He had worked for various companies from the time he commenced his electronic design engineering career in 1967 to 1986 when he commenced his employment with the defendants.
[18]
Mr. Dick states that on January 22, 1991, at approximately 4:00 p.m., his home was the subject of a "search & seizure raid" by the plaintiffs. He was asked to make a copy of information contained on "the" research computer and that he did so. He gave to a representative of plaintiffs, a Mr. Allan Pinkney, a floppy disk containing the file taken from his research computer. Mr. Pinkney is one of the solicitors for plaintiffs.
[19]
There was no cross-examination of Mr. Dick. Defendants then called Richard Doherty, who describes himself as an engineer and writer. Mr. Doherty is an electrical engineer and writes for, as he states in "North America's leading weekly electronics newspaper" and for a bimonthly newsletter on consumer electronics. Mr. Doherty states that he attends 40 to 50 trade shows per year, that while attending these trade shows he has "occasion" to see exhibits by General Instruments "between two and four times a year". Mr. Doherty stated, in reply to a question by defendants' counsel, that he first saw an exhibit by General Instruments that related to "smart card" technology in late January 1991 and this at the Satellite Business Communications Show in Las Vegas. He saw a mock up of a receiver with an integrated scrambler and a cardboard "smart card" inserted in the front of it. What Mr. Doherty saw "was a mock up, nonfunctional to everyone in attendance".
[20]
In early October 1990, Mr. Doherty states he saw and observed the Dectec "smart-card" technology. He states, as a writer reviewing new products, he received the Dectec module for review and inside the module, which he was invited to open and inspect was a "smart-card" about half the size of a business card.
[21]
Plaintiffs' counsel did not cross-examine this witness.
[22]
Defendants next called David Robert Molzahn, who was a former employee of defendant S.E.E., See Electronic Engineering. He was the front office manager and was the first person to greet the persons executing the Anton Pillar Order (of Mr. Justice Dubé). He then went on to describe what took place. He tried to reach the company's lawyer but was unable to do so. He then attempted to discuss the terms of the order but did not get a satisfactory answer. As Mr. Molzahn states:
"Then, he started to explain it through to us very fast and abusive, you know, saying 'this is what this means', blah, blah, blah. 'Have you had enough? Is that - now, can I start?'
"We never got through all the way through. He was explaining, and finally he said, 'Okay, that's enough. Let's get started'. And he started the search."
(Pages 77 & 78 of the transcript)
[23]
Mr. Molzahn states that there were four persons executing the order. He states, at p. 79 of the hearing transcript:
"I took the lawyer into the back, the technical area in the back of our work area. And they split up into teams, and a couple of the gentlemen went into the research and development area here in the back.
"And I was trying to keep an eye on them, but they were skirting everywhere. I just couldn't keep track of them. They sort of broke up into their own little groups, and started looking through everything."
[24]
The witness goes on to state that he was asked and produced a customer list. He states that the persons executing the Anton Pillar Order were "most interested" in two computers, one in the research room and one in the development area. He states he specifically asked for a list of the material taken from the research computer but was not given any list. In describing what took place, Mr. Molzahn states:
"The Witness:
It was towards later in the evening. Pretty much everyone had gone home, as far as --
Me Robert MacFarlane:
Q.	Approximately what time?
A.	Approximately 7:00 they were just finishing off, basically packing up. I had been trying to keep track of what they had been taking. And I know that I had seen them copying files. And at that point, I was getting a little disturbed.
I asked for specifics on what data was being taken from the file and the lawyer said no. I said, 'What? I want to know what you are taking'. And he says - he just flatly refused. He said it would take too long. At that point, I was quite aggravated, and I said, 'You can't do that'. And he said, 'Oh, yes, I am doing it'.
I am generally a very patient person, but at that point I was quite angered. And Joan came and sort of took me aside, and calmed me down, and said, you know, 'Dave, just relax'.
Q.	I understand that you had some inventory in stock.
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And how much inventory did you have?
A.	Over four hundred (400) units.
Q.	And what became of those units?
A.	Throughout the day - there was two (2) separate areas where we kept the inventory. There was the finished stock that was in the shipping room, and also there was stock that was held in the technicians' area that they were working on, that was in progress.
They, throughout the day, were taking things out, and I actually helped them packing the items there, like the boards, so that they wouldn't get all busted up and ruined when they were taken.
Q.	Were they giving you an inventory before they were taking things out?
A.	No, things were happening so fast. They were taking things. They were going out the door. I didn't know if they were on any lists. It was sort of chaotic."
(Pages 82, 83 and 84 of the transcript)
[25]
A list of what was taken was given to Mr. Molzahn "shortly after 7:00 - when they were finishing up". Exhibit 5 is the "list" that was given to Mr. Molzahn by a Mr. McCormack who was in charge of executing the Anton Pillar Order at defendants' premises. Exhibit 6 is a list prepared by the witness during and after the search and seizure. Although Mr. Molzahn states he prepared the document, he admits, in cross-examination, others contributed to its preparation.
[26]
Exhibit 6, as explained by the witness, makes reference to the taking of 172 Liberty/SUN boards from the technicians' area, work in progress and 278 from the shipping area "and those would have been finished products waiting for sale".
[27]
In cross-examination, the witness states that Exhibit 6 is a list of what was seen removed and which was put together by "the staff in the office" and then given, after its completion, to Miss Costello.
[28]
In fact, Miss Costello was given both the lists of "material" taken, that is the list prepared by defendants' employees and the list prepared by Mr. McCormack.
[29]
Mr. Molzahn goes on to state that he and other employees counted the 172 boards as the boards were being boxed to be removed. The same applies to the 278 units, he and other employees counted them as they were being boxed for removal.
[30]
As their last witness, the defendants called Joan Costello. She states she is president of S.E.E. and is the owner of the shares of the company. She states she arrived at her business between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m., met two persons in the office, one stated he was a solicitor and that he had a court order for seizure of product or inventory and that he wanted to go through the order with her. She states she saw "two strange gentlemen on our computers in the technical room and she asked them to leave. They did." She then states she eventually contacted her attorney to express to him her concerns "for the proprietary secrets and our technology". As a result an ex parte application was made and presented before Mr. Justice Walsh who issued an order on January 22, 1991 (Tab 16, Federal Court Orders in Issue).
[31]
Ms. Costello agrees she received Exhibits 5 and 6. She states that she did not consider the "inventory" that she got to be complete as:
"It did not have on it the inventory of our product that had been taken out during the whole day or the afternoon, which they put into a van in front of the building."
(Page 112 of the transcript)
[32]
In cross-examination, Ms. Costello states the staff in each section were recording what was being taken out, the inventory "or anything that was on the computers that they observed, anything". The information on the computers was copied onto diskettes. Defendants kept the hard disk.
[33]
She goes on to state that at approximately 6:00 p.m. she saw Mr. Molzahn and Mr. McCormack together and she assumes that at that time Mr. Molzahn had the list he and other staff prepared and Mr. McCormack's list.
[34]
Although counsel for defendants did not call other witnesses, he read into the record portions of the cross-examination of Ray Allan Griffin III, on his affidavit sworn on August 2, 1991. The cross-examination took place on January 15, 1992.
[35]
Mr. Griffin is an electrical engineer. He is employed (as of January 16, 1991) with VideoCipher, a division of the plaintiff General Instrument and this as of January 1987. Mr. Griffin became involved in the development of the VideoCipher II Plus design. In April 1988, Mr. Griffin was assigned to the Security Engineering Department. His occupation was to "look at piracy materials to try to ascertain how they worked".
[36]
On April 1, 1991, Mr. Griffin executed a confidentiality declaration (Exhibit B, Tab 1, Book of Documents) in which Mr. Griffin acknowledges having received a copy of the Confidentiality Order. He states that he read and understood the order and that he will:
"7. I will hold in confidence, will not disclose to anyone not qualified under the Confidentiality Order, and will use only for purposes permitted by this Confidentiality Order, any confidential document or other confidential material or confidential information that is provided or disclosed to me."
[37]
Mr. Griffin, it was agreed, received "a substantial quantity of materials and documents for analysis" and that almost all of the materials sent to him for analysis were provided as exhibits to his affidavit. The documents sent to Griffin and not included as exhibits to his affidavit were filed in the cross-examination as Exhibit GR-13, Mr. Griffin also produced the P.C. program as GR-14 in his cross-examination. This P.C. program had been sent to him by a Mr. Sprunk.
[38]
Mr. Eric Sprunk was cross-examined on January 20, 1992. He is an employee of General Instrument Corporation, VideoCipher Division as of August 20, 1990. Mr. Sprunk is an engineer at General Instruments, he was overseeing a group of engineers to provide expert testimony in prosecutions. As to what he does, Mr. Sprunk states at page 5, question 39:
"Q.	Tell me a little about what it is that your department does for law enforcement agencies. Do you, for instance, analyze unscrambling devices that have been altered so as to be able to receive programming without paying subscriptions?"

Mr. Sprunk states that on September 17, 1990, he first became aware that General Instrument was interested in finding out more about the defendants' devices which Mr. Sprunk calls "pirate devices". As Mr. Sprunk states "That's (Sept. 17, 1990) the date when we first saw one of these units".
[40]
I would add here that this unit is the same type of unit as was offered by defendants when defendants offered a number of units to plaintiffs for inspection rather than having all the units seized in the Anton Pillar seizure.
[41]
As Mr. Sprunk states, as regards the unit he inspected:
"That particular unit was virtually identical to all the subsequently seen units and materials seen during that seizure."
(Page 149 of the transcript)
[42]
In describing what he saw, Mr. Sprunk states:
"A.	I saw a black plastic cage, which was manufactured by General Instrument. Contained within that cage was one of the devices, one of the SUN decoders.
Q.	How did you know it was a SUN decoder?
A.	At that time, I was not sure what it is. Since, it has become quite clear that it is a SUN decoder."
(Page 149 of the transcript)
[43]
And, in describing what he did, Mr. Sprunk states:
"A.	We did a cursory examination of its workmanship, the technologies used, and what it did when we inserted it into the satellite system."
(Pages 151 and 152 of the transcript)
[44]
Mr. Sprunk, in his cross-examination, admits to having seen several SUN units and that several members of his staff analyzed the units that were given to him for analysis.
[45]
The cross-examination was extensive. Counsel for defendants alleges that Mr. Sprunk supplied to Mr. Griffin the three BCPROG 1 programs.
[46]
Mr. Sprunk states he was one of the individuals to execute the Anton Pillar Order. He was with a Mr. Stewart McCormack and with an employee of Sprunk, Gary Albeck and one other person. Mr. Albeck was one of the individuals who examined the defendants' SUN units (decoders) and as a result, obtained the BCPROG, which they couldn't get beforehand.
[47]
As to what happened with the seized material, Mr. Sprunk states:
"A.	As I described, way after the material was seized and boxed and inventoried, they were transported to vans, which transported the material to locked storage at the Vancouver office of Stikeman, Elliot.
Q.	Yes?
A.	We returned to San Diego. Some months subsequent to that was when the material was sent down to San Diego, and the extractions you see there to be performed.
Q.	By whom?
A.	By - well, counsel sent them.
Mr. Angus: Now, is it your evidence, Mr. Sprunk, that some of the approximately twenty-six (26) units that you say you extracted the BCPROG from are from amongst those that were seized?
A.	Exactly twenty-one (21) of them were."
(Pages 181, 182 & 183 of the transcript)
[48]
There is some confusion as to the exact number of decoders examined by Sprunk and his team of experts. Whether it is 20 or 22 or 26 units is really immaterial. What may be of some significance is that at least 21 decoders examined by Sprunk are from the seized units. Now as to what Mr. Sprunk did with the units is stated by Mr. Sprunk at p. 97, question 563 of his cross-examinations:
"A.	We extracted the code, which you have seen printed here. And we gave them functional tests to determine whether or not these units received First Choice, which is a simple act of tuning to that channel and seeing if the decoder works.
Q.	Hmm-Hmm.
A.	It did, for all of them.
Q.	And what else did you do?
A.	As part of the extraction process, we also determined the unit's ID that the units operate under. This allows us to perform the same functional test. We do this as a matter of course in evidence handling. It allows us to determine whether or not the units steal First Choice's programming or not, which they do."
(Pages 189 and 190 of the transcript)
[49]
As regards the Confidentiality Order, Mr. Sprunk states:
"Q.	Were you aware of the Confidentiality Order?
A.	Yes
Q.	When did you become aware of it?
A.	It is on file. I don't remember the date of my signature on the file. I read the order when I signed it, whatever that date is."
(Page 190 of the transcript)
[50]
On p. 195 of Mr. Sprunk's cross-examination, he states where he obtained the print-out of the BCPROG 1 program.
"Q.	And where did you get that particular print-out of BCPROG 1?
A.	I obtained it. I extracted that information, which we now refer to as BCPROG 1, from the SUN decoder purchased by Pat Costello Investigations in late 1990, I believe."
(Page 195 of the transcript)
[51]
This clearly indicates that the BCPROG 1 program was not obtained from the SUN decoders of the defendants but from one purchased on the open market by Pat Costello Investigations in late 1990 for and on behalf of the plaintiffs.
[52]
Therefore, I am satisfied that the fact that plaintiffs were in possession of 23 SUN decoders obtained as a result of the Anton Pillar Order is of no consequence.
[53]
No other evidence was made.
The Law Of Contempt
[54]
I have stated in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (in appeal) at pp. 10, 11 and 12:
"In the case of
Cartier, Incorporated & Cartier Men's Shops Ltd.
, T-62-86, May 20, 1988 (the appeal of this decision was dismissed), I stated the following as to the law of contempt:
'Mr. Justice Heald, in the case of
Maison des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reported [1988, 3 F.C. 277]), quoted Lord Denning in speaking of the proper approach to be taken in contempt proceedings.'
"Lord Denning M.R. articulated the proper approach succinctly in the case of
In re Bramlevale Ltd.
, [1970] 1 c. 128 at 137:
'A contempt of court
is an offence of a criminal character
. A man may be sent to prison for it. It must be satisfactorily proved. To use the time honoured phrase, "it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt ..." Where there are two equally consistent possibilities open to the court, it is not right to hold that the offence is proved beyond reasonable doubt.'
(Underlining is mine)
'At p. 6, Mr. Justice Heald goes on to state, in speaking of the test to be applied in contempt proceedings:
"The test is the one
required for offences of a criminal nature
- namely, proof beyond reasonable doubt"
(Underlining is mine)
'The issue of contempt and the elements required to find contempt were reviewed in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) both by Mr. Justice Pratte and Mr. Justice Marceau.
'Mr. Justice Pratte, in speaking of rule 355(1) which reads as follows:
"
Rule 355. Contempt In Relation To Court
"(1) Anyone is guilty of contempt of court who disobeys any process or order of the court of a judge thereof, or who acts in such a way as to interfere with the orderly administration of justice, or to impair the authority or dignity of the court. In particular, any officer of justice who fails to do his duty, and any sheriff or bailiff who does not execute a writ forthwith or does not make a return thereof or, in executing it, infringes any rule the violation whereof renders him liable to a penalty, is guilty of contempt of court."
states at pp. 14 and 15:
"Before discussing that judgment, it is necessary to have in mind certain elementary principles:
"(1) As rule 355(1) of the Federal Court Rules makes it clear, a person may be guilty of contempt of court either by disobeying an order of the court or by obstructing or interfering with the course of justice. The only person who may disobey an order of a court is the party to whom that order is addressed. However, a third party who knowingly aided and abetted a party to disobey an injunction may be found guilty of contempt, not because he breached the injunction, but rather, because he acted in a manner that interfered with the course of justice.
"(2) A person cannot be found guilty of contempt of court if the contemptuous behaviour is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In such matter,
the standard of proof is similar to that applicable in criminal matters
.
"(3) a court injunction must be complied with strictly in accordance to its terms. However, the defendant against whom an injunction is pronounced is enjoined from committing the prohibited acts whatever be the method he may use in committing them. It follows that a defendant will be in breach of the injunction pronounced against him not only if he himself contravenes the order of the court but also if the order is breached by his agent, workman, servant or another person acting for him." (underlining is mine)
'Mr. Justice Marceau, at p. 3 of his judgment, states:
"1. Considering what has to be proved, it is well established that
the activity said to have constituted the contempt must be one clearly covered by the prohibition, which implies that it be expressly or by necessary inference mentioned in the order
. Because of this prerequisite, I do not think that the trial judge was entitled to find, as he did, that the commission of a certain action, although not covered by the injunction was nevertheless contemptuous as being contrary to the 'spirit' thereof.
"2. Coming now to the
quality of the proof
, it is also well established that
it must be of the high standard necessary for a criminal conviction
, not the lower standard sufficient to dispose of a disputed question of fact in a civil litigation. The proof must satisfy beyond any reasonable doubt, not merely on a balance of probability."'"
(Underlining is mine)
[55]
Considering the above and the very strict requirements necessary to be met before one can be found in contempt of court, are the plaintiffs in contempt of court as it relates to the orders involving confidentiality issued by the court in this case?
Evidence And Discussion
[56]
As I have previously stated in this decision, the grounds of the application are failing to make a complete list of the articles and documents seized and delivering an unknown quantity of the circuit boards, microprocessor parts and other information to the plaintiffs without first obtaining an order of the court (Paragraph 7, Show Case application).
[57]
A great deal of evidence of many matters was made by the defendants much of which was not relevant to the issue before me. It is only in respect of the acts alleged in the defendants' notice of application that a finding of contempt may lie. I agree with counsel for plaintiffs when he states "The alleged contemner has the right, consistent with the principles of fundamental justice, to know exactly the case it has to meet". It must, at all times, be recalled that contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt indicating, as Mr. Justice Marceau states in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 (F.C.A.) that contempt is very similar to a criminal matter in that a person found guilty of contempt may, if the circumstances warrant it, be subject to incarceration. Therefore, only evidence as it related to paras. 7(i) and (iii) of the show cause application is to be considered.
[58]
During argument, counsel for defendants attempted to convince me that the method of seizure at the home of Mr. Dick was somehow irregular because Mr. Dick was given a number of business cards, one of which belonged to a Mr. Stewart McCormack when in fact Mr. McCormack was not part of the group of individuals who entered Mr. Dick's home and that this may be considered a contempt in that the court orders must be strictly adhered to.
[59]
As I have stated, the alleged contemner has the right to know exactly the case it has to meet. Nowhere can one find the above-mentioned alleged contempt. I am satisfied that if, in fact, Mr. Dick was mislead by the person entering and carrying out the search and that this was an infraction to an order of the court, it was for the defendants to have so stated in the application for the issuance of the show cause order with supporting affidavits. This would have provided the plaintiffs with the opportunity to bring witnesses to explain, from their viewpoint, what took place.
[60]
I do not consider the fact that Mr. McCormack's card was given to Mr. Dick by a Mr. Pinkney as a breach of any order issued in the case.
[61]
After reviewing the above evidence, I am not satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was a failure to make a complete list of the articles and documents seized. This is also apparent from the evidence of Mr. Sprunk when he states, on pp. 189 and 190 of the hearing transcript "... the material was seized and boxed and inventoried ...". Clearly a complete list of the articles and documents seized was made.
[62]
I am also not convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that plaintiffs' solicitors delivered to plaintiffs circuit boards or microprocessor parts and other information to the plaintiffs without first obtaining an order of the court.
[63]
I am satisfied that the plaintiff, General Instrument, only received 21 or 23 SUN circuit boards. I am also satisfied from the evidence that the only person who received copies of the seized material was plaintiffs' expert Roy Griffin who, I believe, was entitled to receive and examine the material, his having signed a Confidentiality Agreement. Mr. Sprunk also received decoders but this is of no significance as the SUN decoders could easily have been purchased on the open market.
[64]
I am satisfied that the defendants have failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiffs or their solicitors have breached any of the many orders issued in this case and more particulary have failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the breach alleged in paras. 7(ii) and (iii) of the Show Cause Order.
[65]
The application is denied. Costs in favour of the plaintiffs.
Application denied.
