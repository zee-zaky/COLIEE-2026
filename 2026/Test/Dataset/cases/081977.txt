Joyal, J.
: This is an action for damages instituted by the plaintiff against the Crown for abusive conduct in the execution of a search warrant on the plaintiff's premises on the afternoon of June 29, 1982.
[2]
The plaintiff, an immigration consultant, alleges that the manner in which agents of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police carried out this search was excessive and without any reasonable relationship to the circumstances of the case and to the behaviour of the plaintiff.
[3]
In essence, the abusive conduct alleged against these agents was the handcuffing of the plaintiff during the execution of the search warrant, the arrest of the plaintiff for obstructing the agents in the execution of their duties and for taking him to the police station where he was photographed and fingerprinted.
[4]
In its defence, the Crown contends that the conduct of the agents in all circumstances of the case was fully justified, that the force used against the plaintiff to ensure compliance was reasonable and that the agents should enjoy the exculpatory benefits of s. 25 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.
[5]
Remembrance of things past is often an elusive pursuit. The details of an untoward incident happening to an individual will tend to be etched in his mind in a clear and uncluttered manner. A more occupational experience, however, tends to quickly merge with many similar experiences and create more difficulty in total recollection. There is also the situation where material facts have taken place in an emotionally-charged atmosphere and where the cause and effect of a sequence of facts are difficult to establish. It is no wonder therefore that a court, in determining what really happened in the course of a specified event is faced with conflicting evidence, confused recollection or memory loss. Such is the problem before me in determining the circumstances surrounding the execution of the search warrant and in putting to the test the conduct of the agents throughout.
[6]
The several witnesses heard in evidence are evenly balanced between the two sides of the issue and none of them can be said to be truly disinterested. Yet, I should make it clear that none of these witnesses lacks credibility and I should hope that any findings I am called upon to make will not impugn on their honesty and on their conscious attempts to tell the facts as they perceived them and as they remembered them.
[7]
The scenario leading to the events of June 29, 1982 had its opening scene in the offices of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police where the immigration detachment had accumulated some information on the activities of the plaintiff as an immigration consultant and which suggested that certain of these activities were in breach of s. 95(m) of the Immigration Act, 1976, 1976-77, c. 52. This provision makes it an offence punishable by indictment or by summary conviction for anyone to knowingly induce, aid or abet or attempt to induce, aid or abet any person to contravene any provision of the Immigration Act, 1976 or the Regulations.
[8]
Earlier in the day on June 29, 1982, a search warrant was obtained covering the plaintiff's business office in the Dominion Square Building  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and the plaintiff's residence on Wavell Road. At approximately 1:15 p.m., four members of the immigration detachment of the R.C.M.P. headed by Corporal Michel Boyer entered the plaintiff's offices to execute the warrant. Corporal Boyer identified himself to the secretary, Mrs. Joanne Forbes, in the reception area and together with Constable Slade, and perhaps a third constable, entered the plaintiff's private office. The plaintiff was obviously taken by surprise and much more important, by fear. Corporal Boyer told him to "Sit down". Corporal Boyer told him he was charged with breaching the Immigration Act, 1976 and that he would go to jail. The plaintiff was shown the search warrant. It was drafted in French and Corporal Boyer interpreted its contents and told the plaintiff he could consult his lawyer. The atmosphere grew tense and loud words could be heard through the door into the reception area. Constable Slade, a female member of the force, went to one of the filing cabinets to start her search. The plaintiff became more vexed and excited and attempted to block access to the filing cabinet. In so doing, he placed his hand on the constable's left shoulder. Corporal Boyer reacted immediately. He arrested the plaintiff forthwith on the charge of obstruction under s. 118 of the Criminal Code and put him in handcuffs.
[9]
Later on, as the search of the premises continued a lawyer, Robert Lord, no kin of the plaintiff, came down from his office in the same building and spoke to the plaintiff and Corporal Boyer. Suitable assurances were given by the plaintiff and the handcuffs were removed.
[10]
At the completion of the search, roughly at three o'clock, the plaintiff was escorted out of the building and taken to his residence on Wavell Road to provide entry to other agents of the R.C.M.P. waiting there. Subsequently, he was taken to R.C.M.P. headquarters, photographed and fingerprinted and released on his own recognizance.
[11]
The scenario goes on. The plaintiff was not formally charged with obstructing a police officer under s. 118 of the Criminal Code nor was he charged at that time under the Immigration Act, 1976. On July 14, 1982, Sergeant Ross Graham, head of the immigration detachment, attended upon the plaintiff in his office, returned all the documents seized two weeks earlier and destroyed in his presence the fingerprints and photographs which had been taken.
[12]
This is not quite the end of the story. Some months later, on October 19, 1982, the plaintiff was charged with an offence under s. 95(m) of the Immigration Act, 1976. The case of the Crown was founded on a letter written by the plaintiff on August 20, 1982 to one of his clients, a Guyanan citizen illegally in Canada for some time and who had been scheduled to appear at an inquiry under s. 27 of the Immigration Act, 1976. The plaintiff advised her that as the inquiry might result in a deportation order against her, it might be preferable for her to return to Guyana voluntarily and apply there for an immigrant visa to return to Canada permanently. The position of the Crown was that this advice was in breach of the statute.
[13]
At his trial on November 12, 1982, the plaintiff was summarily acquitted. The trial judge concluded that the type of advice given by the plaintiff did not constitute an offence. It was substantially the same kind of advice given from time to time by immigration officers themselves to persons scheduled to appear at an enquiry. For anyone who knows anything about the Immigration Act, 1976, the conclusion reached by the trial judge is obvious. One might puzzle over the kind of legal advice the Crown relied on in deciding to prosecute.
[14]
Admittedly, events subsequent to the execution of the search warrant on the afternoon of June 29, 1982 might have only limited relevancy to the issue before me. The court is still faced with the problem of deciding whether the conduct of the agents on that day is justified under s. 25 of the Criminal Code or whether their conduct is unduly harsh, vexatious and humiliating or of a nature to be in breach of the plaintiff's rights.
[15]
In my recitation of the events which took place on June 29, 1982, I have accepted as true some of the evidence given by the plaintiff and his witnesses as well as some of the evidence given by the Crown's witnesses. Some of the evidence of all of them I have merely discounted.
[16]
It was admitted by Corporal Boyer in his testimony that prior to the execution of the search warrant, he was convinced that the plaintiff was committing systematic offences under the Immigration Act, 1976. He knew of course the identity of the plaintiff, having met him in December 1981 when the plaintiff had returned a client's passport to R.C.M.P. headquarters. He knew or had reason to know that the plaintiff was no fly-by-night operator. The plaintiff, a former temporary member of the Immigration Appeal Board, was Montreal-born and had been a resident of that city for most of his life. He had built up, from somewhat scratchy beginnings, an enviable reputation in his community. There was stability in his business as an immigration consultant having been engaged in it for some five or six years. His particular role in assisting immigrants and residents illegally in Canada might have been subjected to some critical light but nevertheless, he was pursuing a particular field of occupation which is neither illegal nor damnable.
[17]
On the afternoon of June 29, 1982, I find that Corporal Boyer approached his task with a mind set. Although the search warrant he was to execute was based on reasonable grounds in believing that the plaintiff was in breach of s. 95(m) of the Immigration Act, 1976, Corporal Boyer executed the warrant on the basis that a charge had been laid. I accept the evidence of the plaintiff's receptionist-secretary, Joanne Forbes, that after disclosing the purpose of his attendance, Corporal Boyer barged into the plaintiff's private office, forcing the latter to back-pedal quickly from the doorway where he was standing. I also accept the evidence of Mrs. Forbes and of her husband who was also in the reception area at the time, that the words directed to the plaintiff were harsh and authoritative and that they conveyed clearly to the plaintiff that he was being charged with aiding and abetting illegal immigrants contrary to the Immigration Act, 1976 and that he would go to jail.
[18]
The whole conduct of Corporal Boyer would be of a nature as to scare the life out of any person, especially the plaintiff who, on the evidence, had never before run afoul of the law and who prided himself, albeit with strong overtones of insecurity, on his accomplishments and on society's regard for them in his singular circumstances. What Corporal Boyer might have anticipated from the plaintiff was a completely helpless, cowering and submissive response. What he got instead, and this I find from the evidence, were excitable and agitated emotional reactions coupled with cries of "Gestapo!" and "You can't seize my files". Later on, when the plaintiff attempted to place himself in front of the filing cabinet, Corporal Boyer simply arrested him and manacled him.
[19]
Was the action by the peace officer justified or was there blameworthy conduct on his part which provoked the plaintiff to act as he did and which excuses the kind of obstruction to which I have referred? A situation of this nature was described before Mr. Justice Major of the Quebec Superior Court in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  verbal or physical reaction of a person in the face of abusive conduct by the police did not constitute an illegal act.
[20]
Again, assuming that the plaintiff's excitable, nervous and unpredictable state was of a nature that required some degree of physical restraint justifying the use of handcuffs until the situation cooled down, were there valid or justifiable motives to arrest the plaintiff forthwith under s. 118 of the Criminal Code and later have him escorted to headquarters for photos and fingerprints? I am mindful in this regard that although duly arrested for obstructing, the plaintiff was never formally charged and, in a gesture which has at least a token of reparation in it, the police returned the photos and fingerprints to him so that they could be ceremoniously destroyed in his presence.
[21]
Inferences are difficult to draw in the face of the conflicting evidence and of the difficulty in establishing a proper chronology of events. Some inferences may nevertheless be drawn which are more favourable to the conduct of the agents and which arise from undisputed evidence. One of these is the explanation given by Corporal Boyer to the plaintiff as to the contents of the search warrant. Another is the decision of Corporal Boyer to allow the plaintiff to obtain counsel and to give some time to counsel to show up before executing the search. The third was Corporal Boyer who, on learning that the plaintiff's mother who lived in the other half of the duplex dwelling where the plaintiff resided was quite elderly and was extremely nervous at the appearance of police officers, gave instructions to his agents at the residence to hold off and wait for the plaintiff to give them free access to the premises. Finally, there is also the factor that the plaintiff remained in handcuffs only for a relatively brief period of time and, upon the assurances given when counsel intervened, the handcuffs were duly removed and no other measures of force or duress were exercised upon the plaintiff.
[22]
Adding more confusing elements to the somewhat ambivalent events are the disparities between the plaintiff's version of the facts in his letter of complaint to the Solicitor General of July 7, 1982 and the evidence he gave at trial. In that letter, written shortly after the event, the plaintiff stated that the police had started their search before he ever had a chance to read the warrant, that no one identified himself as a peace officer and when he refused to sit down upon their order to do so, he was forced by three or four agents to turn around and be handcuffed from behind.
[23]
At trial, the plaintiff stated that the warrant was put on his desk, that one of the agents translated it for him, that he thereafter complied with their order to sit down, to empty his pockets, and to put the contents including his keys on the table. Subsequently, he attempted to retrieve some loose coins from the table and put them back in his pocket. He was told by Constable Slade: "Who told you to pick that up?" When he continued with his action, he was immediately handcuffed.
[24]
It seems to me from all this evidence that the plaintiff's mind is confused as to what actually took place over a fairly short period of time. As a consequence, what is left begging is the chronology of the events which led to the arrest and handcuffing. A finding on that is the only way, in my view, in which a proper assessment of the conduct of everyone involved may be made.
[25]
I find that the manner of entering the plaintiff's private office by the police was more than resolute. The words spoken by Corporal Boyer were provocative and, although they helped create the emotionally-charged atmosphere I have described, they are not per se actionable.
[26]
I find that the plaintiff became obstreperous, agitated and truculent. His own verbal abuse directed at the police, although understandable in the circumstances, was nevertheless of a nature to sustain the conflict. His statement to the effect that the police had no right to seize his files, coupled with his somewhat futile attempt to prevent access to them must constitute, technically, the kind of obstruction covered by s. 118 of the Criminal Code and gives legal justification to his arrest at that time. I should also find that the handcuffing of the plaintiff was, in the circumstances, a necessary incidence to reestablishing some modicum of good order.
[27]
I reach this conclusion with some reluctance and without implying any kind of moral judgment on the conduct of the plaintiff. A feeling of fear and insecurity, aggravated by the otherwise intemporate statements of Corporal Boyer, resulted in an emotional conduct which can be explained or rationalized but not countenanced. For any citizen, faced with the execution of a search warrant, the duty has been and must continue to be: obey ... and grieve later.
[28]
I should address some remarks with respect to the conduct of the police. Although I have found legal justification for their actions, I must also find that Corporal Boyer's earlier remarks and general behaviour fell short of the degree of professionalism expected of members of the Force in the carrying out of their duties. To suggest, however, that such remarks or behaviour fully justified the plaintiff's consequent conduct is to ascribe to officers of the peace a degree of precognition or a drawing room standard of conduct which should not be expected of them. I should also repeat that, after the critical episode had subsided, the conduct of the police was, as the plaintiff himself admitted, civil and cooperative. Perhaps, it was on their part a tacit admission that the whole scene might have been avoided.
[29]
If the findings I have made do not provide the plaintiff with the redress he asked of this court, it is not to cast him in a bad light. To do so would go beyond the kind of enquiry I was invited to make and to ascribe to the plaintiff a lack of moral rectitude which he ordinarily enjoys in abundance. The whole episode, as it affected the plaintiff, may only be described as a sad experience, the kind which is unique, unforeseen and at times uncontrollable. It is a measure of the plaintiff's worth that the charge of obstruction was dropped, that the documents seized were returned to him and that the "test" case subsequently made against him was summarily dismissed. I am satisfied by the helpful evidence of Mr. Frank Auf Der Maur that on the whole, the active social and community life of the plaintiff was not affected by the incident. And neither, as it appears from the plaintiff's own evidence was his immigration consultant's business.
[30]
It is clear from the evidence and from my findings thereon that the plaintiff had more than a mere colour of right in instituting his action. The conduct of peace officers in the carrying out of their duties is always subject to scrutiny in order to assure that their authority is not exercised in an abusive manner and contrary to the rights of citizens. The initiative taken by the plaintiff to bring all these issues to trial was amply justified.
[31]
This brings me to the matter of costs. Although no legal liability attaches to the agents of the Crown, it is clear nevertheless that their conduct showed some excess of zeal in dealing with the kind of case they were asked to handle. Had their conduct, though not actionable, been otherwise, it might not have led to the plaintiff's arrest and to his subsequent complaint. I have a feeling that perhaps the agents themselves share that view.
[32]
In circumstances such as these when the duty of peace officers to administer justice is so tenuously balanced against the rights of citizens to be protected from abuse that judicial determination one way or the other is warranted, I am of the view that the public should bear the costs. An expedient way would be to give costs to the plaintiff. This, however, I am unable to do. It is quite proper, however, that I should dismiss the action without costs.
Action dismissed.
