Pinard, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review made pursuant to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, to have set aside the decision rendered on December 8, 1994 by the Public Service Commission Appeal Board established under s. 21 of the
Public Service Employment Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33 (the
Act
). This decision dismissed the applicant's appeal against the appointments made further to closed competition 94-CIC-CC-NHQ-04533 to fill the position of Programme Officer (PM-03), Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Hull, Quebec.
[2]
The applicant objects primarily to the Appeal Board Chairperson's following decision concerning the application of s. 25 of the
Public Service Employment Regulations
, 1993 (the
Regulations
):
[Translation]: "The appellant also argued that the department could not change the statement of qualifications after the selection process had begun and that the new statement of qualifications was not valid because it did not contain any knowledge factor and because it lacked certain abilities related to the job. At that point, the department objected to the appellant's presenting this allegation because it was not included in the allegations that she had submitted prior to the hearing (Exhibit A-1). I then allowed the department's objection for the reasons which I will explain later in my decision and I told the appellant that I could not deal with this allegation. She then asked that I indicate in my decision that she objected to my decision on this point.
. . . . .
"I would like to begin by explaining why I refused to consider the appellant's allegation concerning the statement of qualifications. This case had initially been scheduled for hearing on November 29, 1994. On that date, the appellant appeared at the hearing and asked me to adjourn it because she was not feeling well. I granted her this adjournment and the hearing of the case was postponed until December 2, 1994. On November 29, the department had informed me that the appellant had still not submitted her allegations to it. I then explained to the appellant that s. 25 of the
Public Service Employment Regulations
required that the appellant provide her allegations to the department in writing before the date of the hearing. This section reads as follows:
'Before the date of the appeal hearing, the appellant or the appellant's representative shall provide to the appropriate deputy head or the deputy head's representative, in writing, the allegations that will be presented at the hearing.'
"The appellant provided certain allegations to the department before the hearing, but did not provide to it the allegation concerning the statement of qualifications. I therefore did not allow her to present this allegation on December 2 because she had not provided it to the department before the date of the hearing, contrary to s. 25."
[3]
In fact, the file reveals that on two occasions, i.e., before the hearing of her appeal initially scheduled for November 29, 1994, and before this appeal was heard on December 2, 1994, the applicant failed to meet the requirement of s. 25 of the
Regulations
because she never provided in writing to the appropriate deputy head or the deputy head's representative the allegation concerning the statement of qualifications in question. The second omission is especially serious because the applicant had been officially informed by the Appeal Board Chairperson that he would refuse to consider allegations that were not presented in the prescribed manner before the hearing on December 2, 1994. The only allegations that the applicant presented in writing are contained in her letter of November 30, 1994 and do not concern the change to the statement of qualifications, which change she merely raised orally at the hearing on December 2, 1994.
[4]
However, the applicant admits that she had been notified of the change to the statement of qualifications before the appointments made in the competition in question, and hence well before the crucial date on which the hearing of her appeal began, namely December 2, 1994. Moreover, she received in due course all the information required under s. 24 of the
Regulations
[see footnote 1]. In the circumstances, given the restrictive nature of s. 25 of the
Regulations
, as indicated in particular by the word "shall" in the English version [see footnote 2] the applicant was obliged to provide a specific allegation in writing concerning the change to the statement of qualifications, before the hearing on December 2, 1994. The fact that she reserved the right, in her letter of November 30, 1994, to raise "other related matters" cannot substitute for this formal obligation imposed under the authority of Parliament because the evidence clearly shows that the applicant was never prevented, before the hearing of her appeal, from providing in writing this specific allegation concerning the change to the statement of qualifications.
[5]
Accordingly, I conclude that the Appeal Board Chairperson properly applied s. 25 of the
Regulations
and that the "audi alteram partem" rule relied on by the applicant was not infringed.
[6]
With regard to the allegations presented in accordance with the
Regulations
, namely, that the applicant was treated differently, that the members of the Selection Board did not fulfil their obligation to act fairly and honestly, that the choice of questions gave some candidates an advantage over others, and that the choice of the marking system did not necessarily guarantee the selection of the most qualified candidate, I have reviewed the complete file, even though these points were raised before me only briefly and in a manner incidental to the principal argument based on the interpretation of s. 25 of the
Regulations
. In this regard, the facts presented in evidence do not support the grievances of the applicant, who did not establish that the Appeal Board based its decision "on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it" [see footnote 3].
[7]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at page 115, Le Dain, J.A., said the following:
"... Selection according to merit is the dominant objective and consideration of the
Public Service Employment Act
and the essential criterion by which the exercise of powers under the
Act
is to be judged. Fairness may be regarded as an implied requirement of the
Act
insofar as it is necessarily related to selection according to merit, but appointments should not be set aside for alleged procedural irregularities when there is no reason to believe that the selection process has not been based on merit ..."
[8]
Later, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at page 56, Décary, J.A., recalled in these words the function of an appeal board set up under the
Act
:
"... It is also settled jurisprudence that the function of an appeal board set up under the
Act
'is to enquire not into the qualifications established by the department for a position but into the question whether the merit principle prescribed by s. 10 has been observed in the selection and appointment of a candidate who has the qualifications determined by the department for the position'."
[9]
Since the applicant has not persuaded me, having regard to all the circumstances of the instant case, that it was unreasonable for the Appeal Board to conclude that the selection of candidates in the case at bar was in keeping with the merit principle, judicial deference must prevail and the present application must be dismissed.
Application dismissed.
