Strayer, J.
: This is an application by the defendant Her Majesty the Queen. The notice of motion seeks an order pursuant to rule 474 that a question of law be determined as follows:
"Can an action proceed in the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, when the limitation period to bring that action against the defendant, if an action exists at all, expired prior to the statement of claim being filed in this Honourable Court?"
If such question is answered in the negative the defendant Her Majesty requests that the statement of claim be struck without leave to amend and that the action be dismissed. The notice of motion in the alternative requests an order pursuant to rule 419 striking out the statement of claim.
[2]
At the opening of the hearing of this application, counsel for the defendant Crown suggested that we proceed with the rule 474 matter and that the remainder of the application be adjourned sine die. I so ordered, counsel for the plaintiff having no objection. It was agreed that I would deal with both aspects of the rule 474 motion, namely, to decide whether a question of law should be stated for determination and, if so, to determine that question of law.
[3]
The amended statement of claim alleges that the plaintiff while in the custody of certain military police (who are joined in this action collectively as "the defendant John Doe") was subjected to sustained physical and psychological abuse of a most horrendous and degrading nature. The acts complained of are alleged to have taken place during the months of September to December, 1973 at or near a Canadian Armed Forces Base in Manitoba. Essentially, the claim is based on alleged assaults, batteries, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution. (Some claims based on alleged violation of the plaintiff's rights under the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
were not pursued before me, it being recognized that the acts in question had occurred before the adoption of the
Charter
). The statement of claim alleges in various places that the plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer discomfort, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of psychological well-being, loss of physical amenities, and reduced ability to perform physical and mental tasks. It is also alleged that the plaintiff "has suffered and will continue to suffer economic loss ...". Although the statement of claim alleges that Her Majesty "is vicariously liable for the conduct of the defendants John Doe as servants of the Crown" it does not allege that they were acting in the course of their employment. The statement of claim offers no explanation as to why the action was being commenced over 19 years after the injuries complained of, nor did counsel for the plaintiff suggest that he would like the opportunity to amend it.
[4]
In the Crown's statement of defence it pleads, inter alia, that the action has not been brought within the relevant limitation periods. With respect to the latter the Crown relies on the
Limitations of Actions Act
of Manitoba (The current
Act
is R.S.M. 1987, c. L-150. The
Act
in force when the injuries occurred was R.S.M. 1970, c. L-150.), as well as the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, and the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50. The Crown pleads that the claim was statute-barred either two or at the most six years after the injuries which are alleged to have occurred in 1973.
[5]
Although the time has expired for doing so, the plaintiff has filed no reply to the statement of defence, and thus has pleaded no reason why the limitation statutes relied on by the defendant Crown should not apply in this case.
[6]
I am satisfied that the necessary conditions apply for a question of law to be determined as requested by the defendant (See e.g.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).). In my view there does appear to be a question of law to be determined on the basis of the pleadings, namely whether as a matter of law this action can be entertained as presently pleaded. By the same token there are no material facts in dispute: the plaintiff has pleaded no facts which, as a matter of law, could be relevant to establishing an entitlement to sue, at this time, in the face of the various limitations provisions. Further, a decision on this matter will be conclusive of the right of action against the defendant Crown.
[7]
I can then proceed to the determination of that question of law. Section 39 of the
Federal Court Act
provides that for all actions in this court, unless otherwise provided by some Act [of Parliament], the limitation period shall be that which would apply "between subject and subject" by the law of the province where the cause of action arose. With specific reference to actions against the federal Crown s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
similarly provides as follows:
"Except as otherwise provided in this Act or in any other Act of Parliament, the laws relating to prescription and the limitation of actions in force in a province between subject and subject apply to any proceedings by or against the Crown in respect of any cause of action arising in that province, and proceedings by or against the Crown in respect of a cause of action arising otherwise than in a province shall be taken within six years after the cause of action arose."
There is no dispute that the cause of action arose in Manitoba because the injuries complained of are all alleged to have occurred at an Armed Forces base in that province. The relevant Manitoba legislation, s. 2(1)(e) of the
Limitation of Actions Act
, supra, provides that in actions for false imprisonment, trespass to the person, assault, battery, "wounding or other injuries to the person", an action must be commenced "within two years after the cause of action arose". Therefore, the present action against the Crown would be barred by the law of Manitoba as adopted by federal law, if the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
is determinative.
[8]
The plaintiff however now relies upon s. 269(1) of the
National Defence Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5, which provides as follows:
"269(1) No action, prosecution or other proceeding lies against any person for an act done in pursuance or execution or intended execution of this Act or any regulations or military or departmental duty or authority, or in respect of any alleged neglect or default in the execution of this Act, regulations or any such duty or authority, unless it is commenced within six months after the act, neglect or default complained of or, in the case of
continuance of injury or damage
, within six months after the ceasing thereof." (Emphasis added)
Counsel for the plaintiff argues that because of the special reference to the "continuance of injury or damage" at the end of s. 269(1), the plaintiff by virtue of his alleged continuing pain and discomfort, loss of enjoyment of life, economic loss, etc., is entitled to sue at any time. For this proposition, the plaintiff relies on the decision of Giles, A.S.P., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), in which it was held that whereas "injury" refers to the "act of infringing someone's rights" the word "damage" refers to the "loss which the plaintiff suffers". Thus, it was reasoned in that case that as the loss continued (the consequences of a fractured vertebrae from an accident occurring more than six years before the action was commenced) s. 269(1) of the
National Defence Act
did not preclude such action.
[9]
I am prepared to assume that the 1985 version of the
Crown Liability and Procedure Act
applies here. The incidents complained of in the present action occurred in 1973 when the relevant provision of its predecessor, the
Crown Liability Act
, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-38, dealing with limitation periods for actions against the Crown was s. 19(1). It was worded slightly differently from the present s. 32, quoted above, in that it stated that:
"Unless otherwise provided in this Act ..."
provincial prescription laws for actions between subject and subject would apply to actions against the Crown. The present
Act
provides that:
"Except as otherwise provided in this Act or
in any other Act of Parliament
..." (Emphasis added)
such provincial laws apply to actions against the Crown. Thus in the applicable 1970
Act
, only the provisions of the
Crown Liability Act
, not those of the
National Defence Act
, governed limitations on actions against the Crown, and the
Crown Liability Act
made the provincial limitations laws applicable. However if the additional words in the 1985 version were to have the effect of allowing the application of a more liberal limitation regime in the
National Defence Act
, it should probably be assumed that such an amendment is remedial and procedural and intended to apply to actions based on pre-existing causes of action (See e.g.,
Board of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[10]
However s. 269(1) of the current
National Defence Act
, or its virtually identical predecessor s. 227(1) in force (R.S.C. 1970, c. N-4), when the alleged wrongful acts occurred, relates specifically to the liability of service personnel in whatever court they are sued. It does not purport to relate to the Crown. Although the Crown's liability is vicarious in the sense that it does not arise unless there is a cause of action in tort against a Crown servant or representative (
Crown Liability Act and Procedure Act
, supra, s. 10), this does not mean that the Crown can always be sued where the servant can, if there is a shorter limitation period which protects the Crown. It has been held that the shorter limitation period for suing a Crown servant provided in the
National Defence Act
does not protect the Crown from an action commenced after the
National Defence Act
limitation period has run out but before the end of the longer period allowed by the
Exchequer Court Act
for actions against the Crown (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  specific to the Crown by the
Crown Liability and Procedure Act
, s. 32 would govern here even if s. 269(1) of the
National Defence Act
could properly be construed as extending the time for action against a Crown servant to up to six months after the consequences of the alleged unlawful act have terminated.
[11]
Further, with respect I do not agree with the conclusion of the learned Associate Senior Prothonotary in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that such is the effect of s. 269(1). There appears to be ample authority in England and in Canada that the words "in the case of continuance of injury or damage" refer to the duration of the wrongful acts or omissions complained of, and not of their consequences (See e.g.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.);
Colbourne and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 742 (Nfld. T.D.).). The interpretation adopted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> would, it seems to me, ignore the great problems of proof involved in suing years after the events complained of, as well as leaving indefinitely uncertain the position of potential defendants. Nor do any policy considerations appear to apply here such as led the Supreme Court of Canada recently in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 321; 96 D.L.R.(4th) 289, to extend to a plaintiff the right to commence an action for incest some 11 years after it had finished, the plaintiff not having understood the responsibility of the defendant until years later after she began therapy. The implications of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision would be that even an adult victim of wrongful acts, though under no legal disability, could wait indefinitely to bring an action as long as he or she was still suffering some consequences of those wrongful acts. I am not convinced that s. 269(1) should be given that broad an effect, even if it were applicable to actions against the Crown.
[12]
I therefore determine as a matter of law that this action cannot proceed against the Crown because it has been brought many years after the expiration of the limitation period as prescribed in the law of Manitoba. Consequently, the action against Her Majesty the Queen is dismissed.
Action dismissed.
