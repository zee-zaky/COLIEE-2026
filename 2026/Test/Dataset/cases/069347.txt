Denault, J.
: This is an application by the defendants, following leave to file a conditional appearance, for an order rescinding an ex parte order of Cullen, J., extending the time for service of the statement of claim and an other ex parte order of Addy, J., also extending the time for service and for leave to serve a notice of the statement of claim ex juris upon defendant Chrysler Corporation. The applicants also ask the court to strike out the statement of claim for failure by the plaintiff to serve same on the defendants within twelve months from the day it was filed and for failure to show sufficient reason why service was not so timely effected. The application is made in virtue of rules 401, 330 and 306 of the Federal Court of Canada.

The facts can be substantially summarized as they are stated in the plaintiff's factum. In July 1984, the plaintiff retained counsel in order to file patent infringement actions against a large number of defendants for breach of a Canadian patent for an invention entitled "Motor Control Device". Before the filing of these actions, the plaintiff and his counsel had agreed, in July 1985, upon a course of action for this and the other claims and to make financial arrangements for the conduct of these actions. On August 15, 1985, the plaintiff's counsel filed the claim in this action and 21 other actions against 46 defendants with the Federal Court of Canada, but failed to sue four other defendants as instructed because he had a conflict of interest with respect to those proposed defendants. Another firm of solicitors was retained with respect to the other four defendants. On February 28, 1986, the plaintiff's counsel advised him that he had now joined another law firm and had a conflict of interest in this and all of the other actions which he had started. He advised the plaintiff that he would leave the files relative to the actions with the other firm of which he was, according to the plaintiff, a member as well. Via a letter dated May 29, 1986, the plaintiff was advised of the name of the solicitor that would be handling his file. In June of 1986, this new solicitor contacted the plaintiff to discuss the conduct of his actions and his financial retainer. On July 4, 1986, he then advised the plaintiff that his firm could not handle this and the other actions because the revised financial arrangement could not be arrived at. By subsequent letter, the plaintiff was also advised for the first time that his counsel had a conflict of interest.
[3]
In view of the problems that the plaintiff was experiencing in retaining and maintaining a solicitor, he attempted to serve the claims himself by mail on August 5, 1986, without proper legal advice, but his attempt was unsuccessful. The plaintiff contacted his present solicitors on October 27, 1986, and also sent a request to his former solicitors to forward their files to his new solicitors. The files were not transferred until January 29, 1987. The new solicitors brought an ex parte motion for an extension of time for the service of the claims in all 23 actions in June of 1987, seeking a six-month extension. Cullen, J., extended, as requested, the time for serving the statement of claim to January 8, 1988.
[4]
In the following six months, the plaintiff's new firm of solicitors was unable to review all of the technical data relating to all 51 defendants in order to give the plaintiff proper legal advice. In particular, as it was decided that the plaintiff should not proceed with 23 simultaneous actions, the solicitors wished to determine against which defendants the actions ought to be pursued. Due to the volume of technical material to be reviewed and the need to consult with the plaintiff and obtain his instructions, the plaintiff's new solicitors were unable to obtain the necessary order for service ex juris and effect service on the defendant Chrysler Corporation within the six-month period.
[5]
The plaintiff served the defendant Chrysler Canada Ltd. on January 7, 1988, one day short of the six-month extension. On this same day, the plaintiff's solicitor filed a further ex parte motion for a new three-month extension for the service of a statement of claim upon the defendant Chrysler Corp. Addy, J., granted the motion on January 12, 1988. On the same day, he also granted a motion, filed on January 5th, 1988, allowing service ex juris of the statement of claim upon Chrysler Corp. in the United States of America. This defendant was served on the 25th of January, 1988.
[6]
In last April, the defendants brought a motion, similar to the present one before the court, in order to object to irregularities in the commencement of these proceedings, and in the service of the statement of claim, and the rescission of the ex parte orders. This motion was heard by the Associate Senior Prothonotary who, obviously, had no jurisdiction to hear an application to discharge an order of a judge of this court [see footnote 1]. His order was set aside by Collier, J.'s, order, on September 13, 1988. The court is now seized with an identical motion as the one filed in April, 1988.
[7]
There is no doubt that the court has an inherent jurisdiction to set aside ex parte orders as of the time when they were made, and "to make such and every order as may be necessary to restore the party adversely affected to the position he would have been in if the ex parte order or judgment had not been made" [see footnote 2].
[8]
In fact, this motion raises only one issue: has the plaintiff shown that there ever existed at the time of the ex parte orders or at the present time "any sufficient reason" to oblige the court to extend the time for service of the statement of claim?
[9]
Rule 306 provides that a statement of claim may be served within 12 months from the date it was filed. This rule implies that a writ should be served as soon as possible and within the delays fixed by law. In a decision delivered in 1970, under the then existing Admiralty Rule, similar to our present rule 306, President Jackett (as he then was) stated [see footnote 3] that:
"The rules of law contemplate, and the justice of the matter requires, that when an action is commenced, the appropriate papers be communicated to the defendants. The law is designed to put some limit on the length of time it can be allowed to elapse before facing a person with a law suit."
[10]
In my opinion rule 306 has not changed that principle. On the contrary, that statement of Jackett, P., was endorsed by Teitelbaum, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to serve a statement of claim should be the exception and should not be easily granted". I agree.
[11]
The court now turns to the facts and will try to find out if the single affidavit filed in support of the first ex parte motion, in June 1987, before Cullen, J., revealed a sufficient reason. Should this affidavit reveal no valid reason for this six-month extension of time to serve the statement of claim, the court will not have to look into the other affidavits filed in support of the second application for extension of time, before Addy, J., in January 1988.
[12]
In brief, the plaintiff's affidavit in support of his first application for extension of time states that after a full year of ongoing communication with his first lawyer in connection with various aspects of the numerous proposed patent infringement actions, they both met on July 15, 1985, and came to a satisfactory arrangement on the course of action as well as to financial arrangements. By result of these arrangements, 22 other actions were filed on August 15, 1985. It seems that the plaintiff's counsel failed to sue four defendants but the affidavit does not reveal that this failure occurred in the instant case. As late as February 8, 1986, the plaintiff was informed of his counsel's intention to withdraw from the case because of a conflict of interest. But the file was to remain with the firm who had, up to then, submitted all accounts and cashed all the plaintiff's cheques in payment of those accounts. The plaintiff is silent as to what happened between February 28, 1986, and May 19, 1986, when he received a letter from the same firm indicating that they would assume responsibility for the actions. The plaintiff met with his new counsel on July 4, 1986, and was then told for the first time, according to his affidavit, that he too had a conflict of interest and could not act on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff decided to try and handle his actions personally and he attempted to serve the claims without proper legal advice but was unsuccessful. He waited until October 27, 1986, to contact his present solicitors who were forwarded the files at the end of January 1987. By that time, 18 months had elapsed since the filing of the statement of claim but the new solicitors waited until June of 1987 to make an application for an extension of time for the service of the 23 statements of claim. The presiding judge granted the motion in July 1987, nearly two years after the filing of the proceedings.
[13]
The rule of practice is now well established that there must be exceptional circumstances to justify the exercise of the discretion to extend the time for service. In May & Baker Canada Ltd., cited above, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that a defendant trying to avoid service would constitute an obvious "sufficient reason", and that there could be other sufficient reasons. But Chief Justice Jackett added (p. 404) that "in my view, however, when the defendant was available for service and the plaintiff was not inhibited from serving or induced by the defendant not to serve, it is almost impossible to think of a 'sufficient reason' for not serving within the time fixed for serving". In that case, settlement negotiations were not considered as a sufficient reason.
[14]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where the court specifically mentioned a number of exceptional circumstances which would justify a departure from the general rule to those mentioned in the Battersby case ([1945] 1 K.B. 23) being: 1. the defendant has been avoiding service; 2. the defendant's address is unknown, as well as others not specified. Among these exceptional circumstances there would be, in summary form:
1. an agreement between the parties, express or implied to defer service of the writ;
2. where the delay to extend the validity of the writ has been induced, or contributed to, by words or conduct of the defendant or his representative, and
3. where the defendant has evaded service or where for reasons without the plaintiff's fault, the writ could not have been served earlier even if the application had been made and granted earlier.
[15]
In my view, there is no special circumstance in the plaintiffs affidavit to support his application for extension of time. There is no evidence that the Canadian defendant Chrysler Canada Ltd. has been avoiding service or that its address is unknown to the plaintiff or his counsel. As to the American defendant, Chrysler Corporation, it would have been easy for the plaintiff or his counsel to know that this defendant was an American company and the way to serve it with the statement of claim according to the Rules of our court.
[16]
In the present case, I am of the opinion that the fact that the plaintiff was experiencing problems with his lawyers in regards to defendants in other cases is not a sufficient reason to extend the delays for service of this action. Neither are the difficulties that the plaintiff experienced with his lawyers in relation with their alleged conflict of interest in respect of those additional defendants.
[17]
Unfortunately for the plaintiff, after carefully examining all of the evidence and the detailed argument made before me, I find no sufficient reason for extending the delay of service of the statement of claim. For the same reasons, I find that the affidavits in support of the application, in January 1988, to serve ex juris to Chrysler Corporation showed no reason to oblige the court to extend the delay for service of the statement of claim to that defendant.
[18]
Accordingly, the order of Cullen, J., dated July 13, 1987, extending the time for service of the notice of the statement of claim to January 8, 1988, is set aside. So is the order of Addy, J., dated January 12, 1988, ordering that the plaintiff be at liberty to serve a notice of the statement of claim out of the jurisdiction against Chrysler Corporation within 60 days of the order. The statement of claim is struck out as against both defendants and the defendants' application is granted with costs.
Application dismissed.
