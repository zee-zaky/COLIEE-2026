Richard, J.
: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to s. 82.1(1) of the
Immigration Act
with respect to a decision of the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated May 8, 1996, dismissing the applicant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The applicant was appealing a removal order made against him on April 7, 1995, by an Adjudicator on the ground that he was described in s. 27(1)(e) of the
Immigration Act
. At the same time, the adjudicator advised the applicant that he had a right to appeal to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board against the deportation order.
[2]
Paragraph 27(1)(e) and s. 32(2) of the
Immigration Act
read as follows:
"27(1) An immigration officer or a peace officer shall forward a written report to the Deputy Minister setting out the details of any information in the possession of the immigration officer or peace officer indicating that a permanent resident is a person who"
. . . . .
(e) was granted landing by reason of possession of a false or improperly obtained passport, visa or other document pertaining to his admission or by reason of any fraudulent or improper means or misrepresentation of any material fact, whether exercised or made by himself or by any other person,
"32(2) Where an adjudicator decides that a person who is the subject of inquiry is a permanent resident described in subsection 27(1), the adjudicator shall, subject to subsections (2.1) and 32.1(2), make a deportation order against that person." [see footnote 1]
[3]
The relevant facts are as follows. The applicant is a citizen of the Philippines. He became a permanent resident of Canada on March 20, 1993, as a member of the "family class", namely, an accompanying dependent son of his father. The applicant's completed application for permanent residence indicated that he was unmarried, which was correct in 1991 and 1992. When he arrived in Canada in 1993, he advised the immigration officer at the port of entry that he was still unmarried despite having been married 10 days earlier. It became known only after he was landed and granted permanent residence status that he had misrepresented his marital status when in fact he was married and had a child of that union. As a result, the applicant was convened to an inquiry and was ordered deported on April 4, 1995. The applicant appealed the deportation order to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board.
[4]
The Appeal Division found that the applicant's visa came void on March 10, 1993, the date of his marriage and prior to his entry into Canada. The Appeal Division noted that the applicant was required by law to report any change in his marital status to the visa officer and the immigration officer at the port of entry. The Appeal Division noted that the applicant failed to cite any mitigating factors beyond the applicant's control which would preclude a finding that the visa became void. The panel adopted the reasoning of this court in
Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.);
Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 52 (T.D.) and found that the Appeal Division was without jurisdiction to hear the applicant's appeal.
[5]
I will deal with each of the grounds raised by the applicant in support of this application for judicial review.
[6]
The first ground relied on was that the Appeal Division declined jurisdiction to hear the appeal by wrongfully determining a jurisdictional fact, that is, that the applicant was not a dependent son as defined in s. 2 of the
Regulations
.
[7]
Since March 1, 1992, s. 2 of the
Regulations
defines a dependent son as issue under 19 years of age and unmarried unless the son has been enroled and in attendance as a full time student and is wholly or substantially financially supported by his parents or is wholly or substantially financially supported by his parents and is determined to be suffering from a physical or mental disability. [see footnote 2]
[8]
Counsel for the applicant claims that the Appeal Division based its decision solely on the ground that the applicant was not single or unmarried. However, this ignores the fact that the applicant did not seek to bring himself within the further wording of regulation 2 either before the Adjudicator or the Appeal Division. The record discloses that the applicant produced a medical certificate attesting to his good health and also of earlier employment. In these circumstances, it was properly open to the Board to conclude that the applicant did not satisfy the requirements of s. 2 of the
Regulations
concerning the definition of a dependent son.
[9]
The second ground relied on by counsel for the applicant is that the Appeal Division wrongfully determined that the applicant's visa was invalid. Counsel for the applicant relied on the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, supra. However, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case recognized four exceptions to the general principle that once a visa is issued, it remains valid. The first is the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> exception. It applies when it is obvious that a supervening act makes the satisfaction of the condition of the visa impossible. This exception to general principle applies in this case. The applicant's marriage prior to his entry into Canada was a supervening act that made the satisfaction of the condition of the visa impossible. Further, the applicant failed to establish that he was a dependent son.
[10]
The third ground raised by counsel for the applicant was that if he was properly found not to be a permanent resident, then his s. 27 inquiry was improper in that it proceeded on the basis of a report completed pursuant to s. 27(1)(e) which applies to a permanent resident. However, the purpose of the inquiry under s. 27(1)(e) is to determine whether the applicant was granted permanent residence based on a material misrepresentation made on his application. The inquiry was properly undertaken under that provision.
[11]
The fourth and last ground raised by counsel for the applicant was based on the doctrine of legitimate expectation. Counsel relied on the statement of the Adjudicator to the applicant following the making of the deportation order that he had a right of appeal to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. Counsel relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. 20 (F.C.A.). In that case, the Minister had admitted to considering claims for refugee status asserted outside that framework of the procedure provided in the statute, but refused to consider that one.
[12]
The court held that these facts engaged the doctrine of fairness so as to require the Minister to give consideration to the respondent's claim of refugee status prior to pursuing any attempt to remove him from Canada. The fact and circumstances of this case do not support such a conclusion. Subsection 70(1) of the
Immigration Act
gives a right to appeal in the present circumstances only to a permanent resident.
[13]
During the course of argument, counsel for the applicant stressed that if the Appeal Division had accepted jurisdiction, then the applicant could have sought equitable relief on human and compassionate grounds. However, the applicant is not foreclosed from making an application to the Minister.
[14]
Accordingly, the application for judicial review is dismissed.
[15]
At the conclusion of the hearing before me, counsel for the applicant requested that I certify the following question:
Does an applicant have a right to an appeal at the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board if an Adjudicator of the Immigration and Refugee Board informs him of a right to do so?
[16]
Counsel for the respondent opposed the certification for such a question.
[17]
It appears to me that this question, as framed, is not a serious question of general importance, but is directed only at the limited circumstances of this particular case. The courts have developed a long line of jurisprudence concerning the doctrine of legitimate expectation and this narrow question which was argued by the applicant on the limited facts of this particular case would not, in my view, be of general importance.
[18]
Accordingly, I decline to certify the question submitted by counsel for the applicant.
Application dismissed.
