Reasons For Judgment
[1] Denault, J.
: This is an application pursuant to s. 56 of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, in which Clarco Communications Ltd. ("Clarco") is appealing a decision of a hearing officer of the Trademarks Opposition Board dated September 30, 1992, refusing the appellant's application, Serial No. 596,357, to register the trademark "SASS". The grounds for this appeal are:
"1. The respondent Matilda Publications Inc. had no standing as opponent to the registration of the mark 'SASS' by the appellant based upon use of the mark 'SASSY' by Fairfax Magazines Pty. Ltd.;
"2. The Registrar erred in fact and law in concluding that the mark 'SASS' was not distinctive of the appellant's magazines at the material date, March 30, 1988."
The appellant is seeking an order setting aside the decision and a declaration allowing its application for registration of the trademark "SASS".
Facts
:
[2]
The appellant, Clarco, filed on November 27, 1987, an application to register the trademark "SASS" in relation to a young women's magazine. The application was advertised on March 16, 1988, and Fairfax Publications Pty. Ltd. filed a statement of opposition on March 30, 1988. The principal basis of the opposition was that it had previously made known in Canada another trademark, "SASSY", in relation to a similar young women's magazine:
"(a) The opponent bases its opposition upon the grounds provided by s. 37(2)(a) of the
Trade-marks Act
... since Application No. 596,357 does not comply with the requirements of s. 29, and more particularly with s. 29(i), in that the applicant could not have been satisfied that it was entitled to use the mark in Canada in association with the wares described in Application No. 596,357 having regard to the fact that at the time of filing such application, the mark was confusing with the virtually-identical trademark 'SASSY' which had been previously made known in Canada in association with the identical wares.
"(b) The opponent further bases it [sic] opposition on the grounds provided by s. 37(2)(c) in that the applicant is not the person entitled to registration of the mark pursuant to s. 16(3)(a) since at the date the applicant applied to register the mark in Canada, namely November 27, 1987, same was confusing within the meaning of ss. 2 and 6 with the said virtually-identical trademark 'SASSY' which had been previously made known in Canada in association with identical wares.
"(c) The opponent further bases its opposition upon the grounds provided by s. 37(2)(d), namely that the mark is not distinctive within the meaning of s. 2 in that it is neither adapted to distinguish nor capable of distinguishing the wares of the applicant as described in Application No. 596,357 from the wares of others; and, more particularly, from the identical wares in association with which the afore-mentioned virtually identical trademark 'SASSY' has been made known in Canada."
The appellant filed a counterstatement of opposition in May of 1988 denying each of the above grounds. On November 18, 1988, the Registrar permitted the opposition to continue in the name of Matilda Publications Inc. ("Matilda") (further details regarding this decision are provided below). On September 30, 1992, a hearing officer of the Trademarks Opposition Board, Mr. Meyer Herzig, refused the application to register the trademark SASS on the basis that the appellant did not meet the onus of showing that the mark "SASS" was distinctive of its magazine within the meaning of s. 38(2)(d) of the
Trade-marks Act
(Formerly s. 37(2)(d). All references to the
Trade-marks Act
in the text of these reasons will refer to the current numbering of the
Act
as amended.). Also, the member noted that with respect to the ground of opposition pursuant to ss. 38(2)(c) and 16(3)(a) it was not satisfied that the opponent, or its predecessor in title, used or made known the mark "SASSY", as required by s. 17(1) (On September 30, 1992, the Trademarks Opposition Board refused Matilda's application of February 1, 1988, Serial No. 600,008, for registration of the trademark "SASSY" on the basis that Matilda did not meet the onus of establishing that its predecessor in title had used the trademark in the United States and made the mark known in Canada.).
[3]
The appellant filed a notice of appeal on the basis of the grounds set out above on November 30, 1992. On January 15, 1993, the respondent, Matilda filed its reply in which it supported the findings of the Trademarks Opposition Board regarding the non-distinctiveness of the trademark "SASS", but disagreed with the finding that it or its predecessor in title had not previously used or made known the trademark "SASSY". By order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary dated February 8, 1993, the statement of opposition and reply to the notice of appeal was amended to include the ground of opposition that the respondent's trademark, "SASSY", which had been previously used by a predecessor in title was confusing with "SASS"; the notice of appeal was amended to include the issue that SASSY Publishers Inc. ("SASSY") is not the opponent and has no standing; and the style of cause was changed naming SASSY as respondent.
Issues:
[4]
During the hearing, the respondent indicated that it would only be relying upon previous use within the meaning of s. 16(3)(a) and s. 4 of the
Act
and not on the making known of the trademark "SASSY" (Transcript pp. 20-21 and 68-69). In addition, it would appear that the appellant admitted that the two trademarks at issue her, "SASS" and "SASSY", are confusing within the meaning of s. 6 insofar as they are very similar trademarks associated with essentially the same wares, magazines, directed as similar markets, young women (Transcript pp. 34 and 42). Even if the appellant's comments do not specifically indicate an admission of this issue, I am in agreement with the Trademarks Opposition Board's findings regarding the high degree of resemblance between the two marks and further consideration of this element of a determination on the ground of confusion is not necessary. Therefore, the remaining issues on appeal are:
1. Did the respondent, Sassy, or its variously named predecessors have standing to oppose the registration of the trademark "SASS" by the appellant?
2. Was Clarco entitled to registration on the basis that its trademark "SASS" was distinctive of its magazine?
3. Was Clarco entitled to registration on the basis that its trademark "SASS" was not confusing with a trademark previously used in Canada by the respondent, Sassy, or its predecessors in title?
[5]
Before embarking upon an analysis of the issues before me, it is important to consider the appropriate standard of review in this instance. As I stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 387, at pp. 391-392 C.P.R.:
"... in cases such as these, the onus on the appellant is two-fold. Firstly, the appellant must establish that the hearing officer erred in his appreciation of the facts or in his interpretation of the law. It is well established that such a decision carries considerable weight and is not to be lightly set aside (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 199;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 107 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 70 (F.C.T.D.)). Secondly, there remains the continuing onus on the appellant to establish its right to registration."
Specifically, the legal burden remains upon the appellant to show that confusion is not likely [see footnote 1] and that the trademark is distinctive [see footnote 2]. Regarding the weight to be attached to the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board, I note at this time that additional issues were raised before me which were not considered by the hearing officer and that additional evidence not before the hearing officer was presented relating to all of the above issues.
Standing To Oppose:
[6]
The first question to be determined is the issue of Sassy's standing to oppose Clarco's registration of the mark "SASS". This issue was raised but not dealt with in the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board:
"By letter dated October 31, 1988, the opponent advised the Office that the statement of opposition originally filed erroneously named 'Fairfax Publications Pty. Ltd.' as the opponent. The opponent should have been identified as 'Fairfax Magazines Pty Limited'. Apparently, the error occurred because of a mix-up with the name of the (correct) opponent's subsidiary company. The opponent also advised that it changed its name to Consolidated Magazines Pty. Limited ('Consolidated') on April 19, 1988, and further, that Consolidated assigned its rights in the mark 'SASSY' to Matilda Publications Inc. (Matilda) on September 14, 1988.
"Clarco filed a cursory and unsubstantiated objection to the opposition continuing in Matilda's name - see its letter dated November 4, 1988. The Office accepted the opponent's above representations - see the Office letter dated November 18, 1988 - and the opposition continued in Matilda's name.
. . . . .
"Moreover, in the instant proceeding, Matilda relied on alleged use of the mark 'SASSY' by its predecessor in the title Fairfax Magazines Pty. Limited in order to gain standing as the opponent. The issue of whether Matilda was entitled to rely on use of the mark 'SASSY' by Fairfax Magazines Pty. Limited in order to gain standing as opponent did not arise. Clarco might have raised the above issue in an amended counter statement, or otherwise, prior to the oral hearing at any time after Matilda filed its evidence. Clarco did not do so. Accordingly, Matilda's standing as opponent is not in issue in this proceeding." (At pages 2-4 of the decision)
[7]
In addition to the factual basis provided above, it is important to note that a further substitution of the named opponent occurred and that the standing issue was raised in the action before me. On February 21, 1990, Matilda Publications Inc. changed its name to Sassy Publishers Inc. Then, on February 8, 1993, the order of Giles, A.S.P., permitted the appellant to raise the issue of Sassy's standing and changed the style of cause to name Sassy Publishers Inc. as respondent.
[8]
Two concerns are raised by the appellant regarding the respondent's standing: whether the opposition to the registration may continue in the name of the respondent notwithstanding various name changes and assignments and whether the respondent may rely on use by previously named opponents on the basis that they are predecessors in title within the meaning of s. 17(1). This latter concern is dealt with below along with my comments regarding whether the mark "SASS" is confusing with the mark "SASSY" within the meaning of s. 16(3)(a) of the
Act
.
[9]
On the issue of whether Sassy may oppose the registration, the appellant submits that the respondent, Sassy, did not file the statement of opposition in this matter, this proceeding was not assigned to Sassy, and that if there was an assignment it is a nullity because it is not possible to assign the right to continue an opposition. The appellant cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  opposition commenced pursuant to the
Trade-marks Act
cannot be assigned. Finally, because Sassy did not file the original statement of opposition and it has no right to continue the opposition, this opposition to the appellant's registration has been abandoned.
[10]
The respondent maintains that there is no evidence that the assignment is a nullity or that the opposition has been abandoned. The respondent submits that the basis for not allowing assignments of causes of action is that they lead to champerty and maintenance, a situation which does not arise here because the respondent has a genuine pre-existing commercial interest in the subject matter of the assignment ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  regardless of who originally brought the opposition, it is the entity which has the "direct and real interest" in opposing the registration and that it should not be denied the opportunity to oppose because of an overly technical objection. If the appeal is allowed on this ground alone, the respondent would be entitled to bring an expungement proceeding raising the same issues as are the subject of this proceeding.
[11]
The starting point for a determination of whether Sassy may continue to oppose the registration is consideration of s. 38 of the
Trade-marks Act
which governs opposition proceedings. In s. 38(1) it states that "any person may ... file a statement of opposition with the Registrar". There is no limitation that the opponent must be a person who would be adversely affected by the outcome of the proceedings or the holder of similar mark. Therefore, provided Sassy or its variously named predecessors in the opposition proceedings are "persons", that is they were corporations in existence when they filed the statement of opposition or were substituted into the proceedings (which they were), the specific requirements of s. 38(1) have been met.
[12]
However, the question raised by the appellant concerns the validity of the substitutions of various subsequent "persons" for the original opponent. In my opinion, there should be no question regarding the validity of the substitution of Fairfax Magazines Pty. Limited for the original Fairfax Publications Pty. Ltd. because I am satisfied that this is not a substitution but a correction of a clerical error or oversight on the part of counsel for the opponent (Affidavit of N. Zivin (14 January 1993) and letter of October 31, 1988 from the opponent to the Registrar). Nor should there by any question regarding the substitution of Consolidated Magazines Pty. Limited for Fairfax Magazines Pty. Limited or of Sassy Publishers Inc. for Matilda Publications Inc. (by order of Giles, A.S.P., above) because these substitutions merely resulted from a corporate name change on the part of the opponent (Affidavit of N. Zivin (14 January 1993), exhibits A and B.).
[13]
The remaining substitution is that of Matilda Publications Inc. for Consolidated Magazines Pty. Limited. The basis for the substitution by the Registrar was an alleged assignment dated 14 September 1988 and which reads in part:
"Consolidated Magazines Pty. Limited does hereby sell, assign and transfer to the said Matilda Publications Inc., all rights, title and interest in and to the said trademark 'SASSY' ... together with ... all rights to oppose applications for the registration of similar or confusing trademarks ..." (Affidavit of N. Zivin (14 January 1993), exhibit C.)
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at p. 689, an assignment of a right to sue for past infringements of a patent was held to be invalid on the basis that the right to sue for past infringement is a cause of action in tort the assignment of which is prohibited by common law. There is no question that the general principle that tort actions cannot be assigned is correct, however, the basis for this principle is a concern that such assignments would lead to champerty and maintenance.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C.A.), McLachin, J.A. (as she then was), recognized that one exception to the general rule prohibiting the assignment of a bare cause of action in tort is the existence of a pre-existing commercial interest. She states at pp. 424 to 425 that
"the essential question to be considered in determining whether an assignment smacks of maintenance or champerty is whether the assignee possessed the requisite financial interest at the time of the assignment."
At issue here is an assignment of the right to oppose a trademark registration. The assignment indicates that, in addition to the opposition proceedings, Consolidated assigned to Matilda all rights, title and interest in the trademark application for "SASSY" and the goodwill of the business symbolized by the trademark for $10 US and other consideration. Also, it appears that Consolidated and Matilda are affiliated. I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence before me that Matilda had a sufficient pre-existing financial interest in the trademark to support the validity of the assignment and, as such, the assignment and subsequent substitution is valid. In my opinion, Matilda had standing to oppose the registration of the trademark "SASS" within the meaning of s. 38(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
and Sassy has sufficient standing to continue the opposition before me.
Distinctiveness
[14]
The second ground of appeal raised by the appellant is that the Trademarks Opposition Board erred in its determination that the mark "SASS" was not distinctive of the appellant's wares. Mr. Herzig's finding on this issue was as follows:
"With respect to the ground of opposition alleging that the applied for mark 'SASS' is not distinctive, the opponent Matilda is not limited to relying on its own use or making known of the mark 'SASSY' - it may rely on third party use or making known. The onus or legal burden is on the applicant Clarco to show that its mark 'SASS' is adapted to distinguish or actually distinguishes its wares from those of others throughout Canada, and the material time for considering the circumstances respecting the issue of distinctiveness is as of the filing of the opposition, in this case March 30, 1988 - see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 287 (TMOB). In deciding the issue of distinctiveness, I am permitted to consider both parties' sales and advertising under their marks 'SASS' and 'SASSY' in the time period between the filing of the application and the statement of opposition. see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (TMOB).
"I conclude from the evidence that the marks 'SASS' and 'SASSY' had become known in Canada to a limited extent at the material date March 30, 1988. The marks became known in Canada as a result of advertisement in printed publications circulated in Canada, and as a result of actual distribution of the magazines 'SASS' and 'SASSY' in Canada. Considering that there is a high degree of resemblance between the marks 'SASS' and 'SASSY' in all respects, that the marks appear on identical wares which would travel through the same channels of trade, and that the marks were first used and made known in Canada at about the same time, I find that the applicant has not met the onus on it to show that the applied for mark 'SASS' was distinctive of its magazine at the material date. The outcome would likely have been the same had I not considered the parties' evidence relating to the time after the date of filing the subject application." (At pages 5 to 6 of the decision)
The appellant submits that while the hearing officer did not err in his determination that the material date is the date the opposition was filed, he erred in his evaluation of the evidence prior to that date supporting the distinctiveness of the trademark "SASS". In particular, the appellant maintains that the lack of circulation figures regarding distribution of the opponent's publications in Canada, the lack of Canadian circulation figures for the publications in which notices appeared announcing the publication of the magazine, and the lack of evidence of any transactions transferring possession or property of the publication was such that the opponent failed to negate the distinctiveness of the appellant's proposed trademark.
[15]
The respondent maintains that the onus is on the appellant to show that the hearing officer was wrong in his determination and to show that its mark was distinctive at the material date. The trademark "SASS" cannot be distinctive if it does not distinguish the magazines in association with which it is used from the magazines of others, namely the magazine "SASSY". The respondent submits that the relevant date for determining distinctiveness is either the date that the opposition is filed or the date that the opposition is disposed of. In addition, s. 17(1) does not apply to the ground of opposition based on non-distinctiveness and as such, the opponent may rely upon evidence of prior use by any person, including persons who are other than the opponent or the opponent's predecessor in title.
[16]
The ground of opposition considered here is set out in s. 38(2)(d) of the
Trademarks Act
: "that the trademark is not distinctive". "Distinctive" is defined in s. 2 of the
Act
as
"a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted so to distinguish them."
While distinctiveness is quite often determined as part of an evaluation of whether the proposed trademark is confusing with another trademark within the meaning of s. 6 of the
Act
, it is possible to refuse an application for registration on the basis of non-distinctiveness independent of the issue of confusion, provided the ground is raised in opposition. This is because of the reference to "others", meaning any other person, provided in the definition and because the material dates for determining the issues are different. The appellant argued that s. 17(1) applied to the ground of distinctiveness such that the opponent could not rely on evidence relating to "others" who are not the opponent's predecessors in title. I must disagree. The quality of distinctiveness is a fundamental and essential requirement of a trademark and the ground of lack of distinctiveness may be raised in opposition by any person and may be based on a failure to distinguish or to adapt to distinguish the proposed trademark from the wares of any others.
[17]
The question to be determined here is whether at the material date the proposed trademark "SASS" was adapted to distinguish the magazines of the appellant from the magazine "SASSY". The hearing officer found that the material date was the date of filing of the opposition, March 30, 1988, although he indicated that the material date might have been the date of filing of the application for registration and, if so, the mark was not distinctive nonetheless. The respondent submits that another date is the material date for determining distinctiveness, i.e. the date the opposition is determined or the date of the Trademarks Opposition Board's decision.
[18]
Until the jurisprudence cited by the respondent in support of its submission, the relevant date for considering the issue of non-distinctiveness in an opposition proceeding has been the date of filing for the opposition. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 126, at p. 130  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 463, at p. 467 C.P.R. (F.C.T.D.). There had been some uncertainty as to whether the material date was the date of filing the application or the date of filing the opposition but the uncertainty seemed to have been settled in favour of the latter date. (Note the hearing officer's comments and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ibid., at p. 130 C.P.R.)
[19]
However, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 413, at p. 422 C.P.R. (F.C.A.), Madam Justice Desjardins states:
"The
Trade-marks Act
contains provisions which indicate the date at which certain situations are to be assessed. For instance, s. 16(1) of the
Act
refers to the date the mark was first used or was made known in relation to wares or services as the date where confusion is to be assessed. Section 16(3) of the
Act
refers to the date of filing of the application as the date where confusion is to be assessed. Section 6(5) of the
Act
, however, contains no indication as to the material date for determining whether trademarks or trade names are confusing. In such circumstances, the rule generally applicable in adjudicating matters should prevail, that is the date where the matter is disposed of on the evidence adduced."
She then reviews the opinions of Heald, J.A., as expressed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 29, at p. 35 C.P.R. (F.C.A.), and Cattanach, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), and then states at page 424 C.P.R.:
"In an opposition to registrability, the view adopted by Heald, J.A., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> appears to me to be the most logical one. I find no fallacy in the possibility of an update of the situation by the parties when the issue is whether statutory recognition should be given to a mark. It is important, it would seem to me, that the decision of the Registrar or the court be taken on an accurate state of the record. Registrability should be decided at the date of registration or at the date of refusal of registration."
The fallacy to which she refers is one which is identified by Cattanach, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at p. 52:
"The obvious fallacy in accepting the date of opposition proceedings as the effective date for the consideration of the rights between the parties rather than the date of the filing of the opposition would permit the circumstances being varied in the interval to strengthen the position of one of the parties."
Madame Justice Desjardins' decision in
Park Avenue Furniture
was considered by the Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 at pp. 3-4 C.P.R., when it held that the material date for a determination of registrability under s. 38(2)(b) is the date the matter is disposed of.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 349 at p. 357 C.P.R., the Court of Appeal held that the date as of which an opposition is disposed of is the only relevant date in determining the issue of confusion. On the basis of
Park Avenue Furniture
and
Canadian Olympic Assn.
, it is settled that the relevant date for determining the ground of opposition raised by s. 38(2)(b), registrability, is the date the opposition is disposed of, in other words the date of the Trademarks Opposition Board's decision. The question remains, however, whether this is also the relevant date for a determination of distinctiveness pursuant to s. 38(2)(d).
[20]
I tend to agree with Madame Justice Desjardins' analysis in
Park Avenue Furniture
and consider that the relevant date in an opposition based on s. 38(2)(d) is the date the opposition is disposed of rather than the date of filing of the opposition. This represents a departure from previous jurisprudence and since the Court of Appeal only expressly dealt with s. 38(2)(b), I cannot find that the Trademarks Opposition Board committed an error when it decided that SASS was not distinctive on the basis of evidence prior to the date of filing the opposition. In addition, in view of the conclusion that I have reached below, a determination that the relevant date is the date of the opposition does not affect the final disposition of this case.
[21]
The evidence which was led by Sassy to show that the trademark "SASSY" was known in Canada prior to March 30, 1988, may be summarized as follows: publication and distribution of the preview issue of "SASSY" magazine and promotional kits in October 1987; advertisements in
Adweek
magazine and
Advertising Age
in June and September 1987; articles in the
New York Times
and
Advertising Age
on August 24, 1987; and distribution of the premiere issue of "SASSY" magazine in February 1988. The respondent also presented evidence of "SASSY" being known in Canada between March 30, 1988 and September 30, 1992: "SASSY" magazine was published and distributed on a monthly basis with a circulation in Canada of 16,416 copies in September 1988.
[22]
The appellant's evidence regarding the distinctiveness of its marks is scant and is based on the affidavit of Kelly Falls sworn on August 29, 1989. In it she indicates that the trademark was made known in Canada through an advertisement in
Marketing
magazine and Clarco's own trade magazine in December 1987, an advertisement and supplement in the March/April 1988 issue of
Cosmetics Beauty Guide
, and an issue of "SASS" is published in April 1988. She also provides Canadian circulation figures for
Marketing
magazine, the trade magazine,
Cosmetics Beauty Guide
and "SASS". The appellant objected to the respondent's evidence on a number of grounds which I do not accept, but which could apply to its own evidence.
[23]
On the basis of the evidence before me as it relates to the issue of distinctiveness, I have come to the same conclusion as the Trademarks Opposition Board: both the marks "SASS" and "SASSY" became known in Canada prior to March 30, 1988, to some extent through announcements in various trade publications and other magazines and through the distribution of a preview magazine. I would come to the same conclusion if the material date is the date of the Trademarks Opposition Board's decision, September 30, 1992, except I note that Sassy's evidence at that date was even more convincing. While the respondent has an evidential burden to lead evidence to show that there is a similar work bearing a similar trademark which has become sufficiently known to negate the distinctiveness of the proposed trademark [see footnote 3], the appellant continues to bear the onus of proving that the proposed mark is distinctive [see footnote 4]. In my opinion, the appellant has not met this burden and has failed to demonstrate that its mark was distinctive both at the time of filing the opposition and at the date of the Trademarks Opposition Board's decision. Therefore, I am in agreement with the Trademarks Opposition Board's decision on this issue.
Confusion
[24]
Because of the conclusion I have reached above, it is not necessary to consider this issue in order to dispose of this appeal. However, in the order of Mr. Giles, A.S.P., the respondent raised this issue of whether the proposed mark "SASS" is confusing pursuant to s. 16(3)(a) and s. 17(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
. The issue of previous use was not before the Trademarks Opposition Board's hearing officer, nor was some of the evidence relating to s. 17(1) and, as such, I will consider the issue briefly though I do not find in favour of the respondent.
[25]
The member of Trademarks Opposition Board made the following finding on this issue:
"Matilda's evidence is vague as to which person used and made the mark 'SASSY' known in Canada prior to and at the relevant date November 27, 1987. At best as I am able to determine from the evidence, it was Fairfax Publications (US) Inc. that used and advertised the applied for mark prior to, and for a period of time after, the material date. Mr. Latora asserts that Matilda was formerly Fairfax Publications (US) Limited but no date or circumstances surrounding the change, or the corporate histories of those companies, are disclosed in the evidence. I am not satisfied that Matilda has established that it, or its predecessor in title Fairfax Magazines Pty. Limited, used or made the mark 'SASSY' known in Canada as required by s. 17(1)" (At pages 4 to 5 of its decision).
[26]
According to s. 16(3)(a) and s. 17(1) of the
Act
, Sassy has the evidential burden of showing that it or its predecessors in title previously used or made known a confusing trademark and that the mark was not abandoned. As mentioned above, the appellant does not dispute that the trademarks were confusing within the meaning of s. 6 of the
Act
and the respondent has dropped the ground of "previous making known". The difficult factual question remaining is whether Sassy or its predecessors in title used the trademark previous to the date of Clarco's application for registration on November 27, 1987.
[27]
I am in agreement with the hearing officer that the evidence demonstrates that Fairfax Publications (US) Ltd. used the trademark previous to the material date through the publication and distribution in Canada of the preview issue of "SASSY" magazine. In addition, Sassy demonstrated that Fairfax Publications (US) Ltd. is its predecessor [see footnote 5]. However, there is no evidence that Fairfax Publication (US) Ltd. had title to the trademark. On the contrary, the assignment referred to above indicates that Consolidated had title to the trademark and the relationship between Consolidated and Fairfax Publications (US) Ltd. remains unclear. On this basis, I would uphold the Trademarks Opposition Board's finding that Sassy failed to discharge the onus of establishing that it or its predecessors in title previously used the trademark "SASSY".
Conclusion
[28]
To summarize, I have reached the conclusion that the respondent has standing to maintain the opposition to the registration of the trademark "SASS" and it succeeds in its opposition on the basis of the non-distinctiveness of the trademark. Therefore, I would uphold the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board refusing the appellant's application for registration. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
