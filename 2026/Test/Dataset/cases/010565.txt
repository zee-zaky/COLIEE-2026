I.
Overview
[1]
O'Reilly, J.
: Mr. Gleb Suhatski was born in Ukraine, then moved with his parents to Israel in 1994. He claims that he was harassed and bullied at school in Israel because of his Russian ethnicity, and because he was neither Jewish nor circumcised. His experiences led him to adopt anti-Zionist views which, in turn, caused him to become a conscientious objector and to refuse service in the Israeli army.
[2]
Mr. Suhatski claimed refugee protection in Canada based on his Russian ethnicity, his conscientious objector status, and the fact that he had not been circumcised. He also claimed, as a bisexual male, discrimination based on sexual orientation. His claim was based on both sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] (see Annex).
[3]
A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board refused Mr. Suhatski's claim based on a lack of supporting evidence and the existence of state protection in Israel. Mr. Suhatski contests the Board's findings, arguing that it unfairly failed to consider documentary evidence he submitted after his hearing, and at the same time, unfairly relied on documentary evidence of which he was unaware. He also argues that it rendered an unreasonable decision. He asks me to quash the Board's decision and order a new hearing of his claim.
[4]
In my view, the Board did not treat Mr. Suhatski unfairly or render an unreasonable decision. The documentary evidence he provided after the hearing was not material; nor was the extrinsic evidence the Board consulted. Further, the conclusions the Board reached were supported by the evidence and, therefore, were reasonable. Accordingly, I can find no grounds for overturning the Board's decision and must dismiss this application for judicial review.
[5]
There are two issues:
1. Did the Board treat Mr. Suhatski unfairly?
2. Was the Board's decision unreasonable?
II.
The Board's Decision
[6]
The Board considered Mr. Suhatski's claim of mistreatment based on his ethnicity as a non-Jewish, ethnically Russian Israeli, his status as a conscientious objector, his sexual orientation, and his fear of circumcision. It then analyzed the availability of state protection in Israel for persons in Mr. Suhatski's circumstances.
(a) Mistreatment as a Russian Israeli
[7]
The Board observed that to be considered persecution, harm must be inflicted with repetition or persistence, or in a systematic way, and the alleged mistreatment must threaten a claimant's basic human rights in a fundamental fashion. Harassment and discrimination might not amount to persecution.
[8]
The Board found that there was no evidence, other than Mr. Suhatski's statements, to support his claims. Further, the alleged mistreatment occurred while Mr. Suhatski was in elementary or high school. The Board did not accept that those acts amounted to persecution.
[9]
The Board did not find support for Mr. Suhatski's claim in the available documentary evidence. Of the one million or so immigrants from the former Soviet Union [FSU] living in Israel, roughly 300,000 were not Jewish. The Board noted that "[r]eports of discrimination against immigrants from the FSU were scarce". Further, Israel's Ministry of Immigrant Absorption offers a variety of services to immigrants in the Russian language.
[10]
The Board found that immigrant children sometimes have difficulty settling in Israel and are disproportionately involved in delinquency, truancy and substance abuse. However, there was no evidence of deliberate or systemic bullying or violence directed at immigrants from the FSU in Israeli schools. Further, they are not at risk of ill treatment or violence. A special Ombudsman unit provides services to children from the FSU.
[11]
Accordingly, the Board found there was no documentary evidence to corroborate the alleged mistreatment Mr. Suhatski claimed to have endured as a result of his Russian ancestry.
(b) Persecution as a conscientious objector
[12]
The Board acknowledged Mr. Suhatski's "deep belief in human rights" and his contention that the Israeli army had been violating human rights by its military activities in Gaza. Accordingly, from his point of view, "serving in any capacity would make me complicit in their crimes, and politically, I disagree with Israel for keeping those occupied territories and seizing Gaza". However, the Board found that Mr. Suhatski was not a member of any group opposed to Israel's military actions either before or after leaving Israel, and had never publicly expressed his beliefs.
[13]
At the hearing, Mr. Suhatski testified that he would have no problem serving in the military if it was not involved in war crimes. The Board found this inconsistent with his earlier testimony that he would not serve at all. The Board concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Suhatski did not have a deep-seated, sincerely-held opinion consistent with being a conscientious objector and had not provided persuasive objective evidence in this regard.
(c) Persecution based on sexual orientation
[14]
Mr. Suhatski testified that he had never had a romantic relationship either with a male or a female in Israel or in Canada. He once kissed a girl in Canada two years earlier. The Board found it unreasonable that he had not mentioned any relationship in his written narrative to support his claim with respect to sexual orientation.
[15]
The Board acknowledged that it was not easy to determine a person's sexuality, given that this is something "imbedded in his inner feelings". But it also noted there was nothing in the evidence from which it could infer that Mr. Suhatski was either homosexual or bisexual. While he had provided evidence of his participation in gay pride activities, the Board gave it little weight because anybody could participate in those events.
[16]
Finally, the Board noted that Mr. Suhatski testified that he could live safely in Tel Aviv as a bisexual person. As such, sexual orientation was not a real issue.
(d) Circumcision-based claim
[17]
The Board found there was no basis for Mr. Suhatski's allegations of mistreatment based on his refusal to be circumcised. It found that the evidence dealt only with the medical and anatomical implications of circumcision, not his status in Israel. The Board also found no supportive documentary evidence on this issue in its country condition documentation. It conducted outside research from the "Jewish Circumcision Resource Center" from which it concluded that circumcision is not necessarily the source of Jewish identity or of its strength, that not circumcising is a choice of a minority of Jews now, and that circumcision has lost its meaning as a sacred act.
(e) State Protection
[18]
The Board found that Mr. Suhatski also failed to provide clear and convincing evidence of a lack of state protection. First, the Board noted various mechanisms and government agencies in place in Israel to address the discriminatory acts he claimed to have endured:
• The Association for Civil Rights deals with complaints from Israelis who believe their civil rights have been violated; and
• The Office of the Ombudsman examines complaints against government offices, state institutions, local governments and other bodies; anyone can file a complaint in any language, in person or via the internet.
[19]
Second, with respect to his claim to be a conscientious objector, the Board found there were recourses available to Mr. Suhatski after he received his-call up notices in 2006. The policy in place at the time distinguished between "total" objections to service, stemming from pacifism, and "selective" objection, stemming from political objection to specific policies. Those in the former category were given an exemption from service, while those in the latter category could be tried and jailed for refusing to enlist. Persons who claim to be conscientious objectors are entitled to a hearing before a special committee.
[20]
In addition, the Public Appeals Commissioner serves as an intermediary between the military and civilians. It handles complaints from soldiers, as well as requests for deferrals and exemptions from service.
[21]
The Board found that Mr. Suhatski did not avail himself of any of these recourses before leaving Israel. He explained that he was aware of the committee dealing with conscientious objectors, but he believed that it was highly flawed. He relied on information given to him by an individual named Dr. Sergey Sandler-Yogev. The Board noted that this person's credentials were not established and his affidavit was not unbiased. It gave this evidence little weight.
[22]
The Board also cited the well-known presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens. Israel is a democracy with an independent judiciary and military forces under civilian control. The Board found that Mr. Suhatski had not discharged the burden of showing that the state was not willing or able to protect him.
[23]
Further, the Board noted that compulsory military service, in itself, does not constitute persecution. In countries where service is compulsory, the prosecution and incarceration of conscientious objectors does not constitute persecution.
(f) Section 97
[24]
In addition to his claim to be a Convention refugee, Mr. Suhatski claimed to be a person in need of protection under s 97 of IRPA because of a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Israel. The Board found that any sanctions and penalties Mr. Suhatski faced for avoiding military service were pursuant to general laws enacted by a legitimate state. It found no evidence that the potential punishments were excessive or beyond international standards and, therefore, his claim under s 97 of IRPA also failed.
III.
Did the Board treat Mr. Suhatski unfairly?
(a) Post-hearing documents
[25]
Mr. Suhatski complains that documents he provided to the Board after the hearing were improperly refused. In addition, the Board failed to provide reasons for refusing to accept the additional evidence.
[26]
This evidence related to:
• The situation generally in Israel and the Occupied Territories;
• The treatment of non-Jewish Russian Israelis; and
• The treatment of Palestinians under occupation.
[27]
Mr. Suhatski says that this evidence was directly relevant to his claim.
[28]
Having reviewed this evidence, I find that any breach of procedural fairness was inconsequential. The Board dismissed Mr. Suhatski's claim as a Russian Israeli because the mistreatment he alleged did not amount to persecution. The documentary evidence he provided after the hearing cites some difficulties that Russian Israelis sometimes have with settling in certain areas (e.g. Bethlehem) or renting accommodation (e.g. in Tel Aviv). This evidence did not further his claim of persecution.
[29]
In addition, the Board dismissed Mr. Suhatski's claim as a conscientious objector not because of a lack of documentary evidence, but because his testimony was not credible, there was a lack of evidence showing that he refused to serve in the military for principled reasons, and there were recourses available to him within Israel where he could raise his concerns about military service.
[30]
Therefore, the Board's refusal to accept this evidence had no material effect on its decision (as in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Mr. Suhatski had already presented a large volume of documentary evidence on these issues. The additional documentation is largely repetitive of what was already before the Board.
(b) Evidence relating to the issue of circumcision
[31]
Mr. Suhatski objects to the Board's reliance on extrinsic evidence to which he was not given an opportunity to respond. He asserts that the extrinsic evidence relied on by the Board was from American sources rather than Israeli ones, and was used to impugn his testimony.
[32]
Mr. Suhatski also disputes the Board's label of "self-serving" to describe his evidence on this issue, and cites case law that cautions against the use of that term:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA).
[33]
In my view, the Board would have been well-advised to have sought submissions from Mr. Suhatski on the extrinsic evidence on which it relied, and to have avoided the use of the term "self-serving". However, the evidence the Board consulted was not material to its conclusion that the discrimination of which Mr. Suhatski complained simply did not amount to persecution.
IV.
Was the Board's decision unreasonable?
(a) The Board's treatment of the documentary evidence
[34]
Mr. Suhatski contends that the Board overlooked hundreds of documents and articles without explanation. These documents included information about:
• Human rights abuses and illegal practices of the Israeli military;
• The widespread use of torture;
• The 2006 invasion of Lebanon;
• The 2008 attack on Gaza and the ongoing siege there;
• The illegal attack on the Gaza flotilla in international waters; and
• The destruction of villages "amounting to ethnic cleansing".
[35]
Mr. Suhatski maintains that the Board's decision should be overturned because of its failure to explain why it rejected this evidence.
[36]
Mr. Suhatski also says that the Board dismissed the sworn statement of Dr. Sandler-Yogev without a valid reason, and that the document should be presumed to be truthful.
[37]
Clearly, the Board cannot be expected to have recited the reams of documents that were put into evidence. What is required, in order for the Board's decision to be reasonable, "is that the reasons, read in the context of the record and the submissions on the live issues in the case, show that the judge has seized the substance of the matter. Provided this is done, detailed recitations of evidence or the law are not required":
R v M (RE)
, 2008 SCC 51 at para 43; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[38]
Mr. Suhatski has failed to show that the evidence the Board allegedly ignored was material or of probative value. Again, the main issues with respect to his claim to be a conscientious objector were credibility and the lack of evidence showing that he refused to serve in the military for principled reasons. Further, the Board found that the discrimination that Mr. Suhatski claimed to have encountered in Israel did not amount to persecution.
[39]
Mr. Suhatski has simply not shown how any of the allegedly ignored documentary evidence would have been relevant to the Board's findings. With respect to the Board's treatment of the sworn statement from Dr. Sandler-Yogev, the Board concluded that it should be given little weight because his qualifications were unproven. It is for the Board to decide the weight of evidence.
[40]
Further, the affidavit confirms that Mr. Suhatski was distressed at the prospect of serving in the military, based partly on "an ideological subtext" that was "quite vague at the time". His views became clearer more recently, but Dr. Sandler-Yogev does not specify what those views are. In my view, this affidavit provided little support for Mr. Suhatski's claim to be a conscientious objector.
(b) The Board's analysis of the conscientious objector claim
[41]
Mr. Suhatski notes that he objected to military service on moral and legal grounds related to Israeli policies and military actions. He contends that the Board ignored his evidence and, instead, determined that because he was not actively involved in any groups opposed to Israel's military policies he was not a genuine conscientious objector.
[42]
Mr. Suhatski also relies on his involvement with the "New Profile List", an anti-occupation Israeli organization, whose leader, Dr. Sandler-Yogev, confirmed his contact with the group and provided information on military policies regarding conscientious objectors.
[43]
Further, Mr. Suhatski says the Board was obliged to consider the documentary evidence to determine if the UNHCR Handbook applied to his case. In particular, Mr. Suhatski faults the Board for not giving more consideration to whether he was a "selective conscientious objector", relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA) at para 38;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The starting point for this analysis is paragraph 171 of the UNHCR Handbook, which reads:
Not every conviction, genuine though it may be, will constitute a sufficient reason for claiming refugee status after desertion or draft-evasion. It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the international community as contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.
[44]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Yves de Montigny adopted the analysis set out by Justice Anne Mactavish in
Hinzman, Re
, 2006 FC 420 at paras 108-9, aff'd 2007 FCA 171. Justice Mactavish found that paragraph 171 of the UNHCR Handbook had to be read in conjunction with paragraph 170. This led her to conclude that paragraph 171 has both objective and subjective components:
Paragraph 170 speaks to the nature and genuineness of the personal, subjective beliefs of the individual, whereas paragraph 171 refers to the objective status of the "military action" in issue. That is, to come within paragraph 170 of the Handbook, the claimant must object to serving in the military because of his or her political, religious or moral convictions, or for sincere reasons of conscience. In this case, the Board accepted that Mr. Hinzman's objections to the war in Iraq were indeed sincere and deeply-held, and no issue is taken with respect to that finding.
Mr. Hinzman has therefore brought himself within the provisions of paragraph 170 of the Handbook. This is not enough, however, to entitle him to seek refugee protection, as paragraph 171 is clear that a genuine moral or political objection to serving will not necessarily provide a sufficient basis for claiming refugee status. Paragraph 171 requires that there also be objective evidence to demonstrate that "the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the international community as contrary to the basic rules of human conduct".
[45]
In my view, the Board did not err by not assessing the objective branch of the test, because it found that Mr. Suhatski failed at the first stage of the test - he was not able to demonstrate that his objections were sincerely and deeply held. As Justice de Montigny explained in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , "People who resist the draft or evade the army on a principled basis are assumed to fear persecution on the basis of political or religious reasons. If their motives are more mundane ...a claimant could not be considered a Convention refugee" (at para 60).
[46]
Here, the Board acknowledged that Mr. Suhatski had asserted deep beliefs in human rights and political disagreement with Israel's policies toward the Occupied Territories, but it nonetheless found that his actions were inconsistent with his stated beliefs. It concluded that his "testimony does not lend credence at all to his allegation of being a conscientious objector". As Justice de Montigny observed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , "I would have been prepared to defer to the PRRA officer had her conclusion been based on Mr. Lebedev's credibility and the lack of evidence showing he refused to serve ...for principled reasons" (at para 61).
[47]
Further, any error by the Board in this area would not have affected its independent finding that state protection was available to Mr. Suhatski.
(c) The Board's analysis of state protection
[48]
Mr. Suhatski maintains that the Board's conclusion is not supported by the evidence. He relies on a recent decision of this Court that found the Board had erred in its determination that state protection was available for an Arab Israeli (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[49]
The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision is not relevant to this case. The allegations in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> were markedly different than those in this case - the claimant there based his claim on a fear of persecution by an extremist Muslim group. Whether the Board erred in finding that state protection was unavailable for that claimant has no relevance to the question of whether the Board's determination in this case was reasonable.
[50]
Here, the Board set out a number of government agencies, programs, and safeguards that are in place in Israel both for persons who claim to experience discrimination as non-Jews in Israeli society, and for those who seek exemptions from military service as conscientious objectors. Mr. Suhatski does not challenge these findings directly and I can see no reason to disturb them.
(d) The Board's analysis of cumulative discrimination as persecution
[51]
Mr. Suhatski contends that the Board ignored evidence supporting his claim based on cumulative discrimination, and discrimination against non-Jews in Israel.
[52]
Mr. Suhatski has not presented any grounds to believe that the evidence on which he relies would have altered the Board's ultimate determination. On the issue of cumulative discrimination, the Board found that the treatment of which Mr. Suhatski complained did not amount to persecution, that his fears were not objectively well-founded, and that there was adequate state protection available in Israel against that sort of treatment. Mr. Suhatski's submissions are not specifically directed toward any of these findings.
V.
Conclusion and Disposition
[53]
I find that the Board did not treat Mr. Suhatski unfairly. Nor did it render an unreasonable decision given the evidence before it. Its conclusion was transparent, intelligible, and defensible in light of the facts and the law. I must, therefore, dismiss this application for judicial review.
[54]
The parties may make submissions regarding a question for certification within five days of the issuance of this judgment.
JUDGMENT
[55]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed;
2. The Court will consider any submissions regarding a certified question that are filed within five (5) days of the issuance of these reasons.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O'Reilly
[Traduction]: M. Gleb Suhatski est né en Ukraine, et, en 1994, il a déménagé en Israël avec ses parents. Il prétend qu'il a été victime de harcèlement et d'intimidation à l'école dans ce pays parce qu'il était d'origine russe et parce qu'il n'était pas juif et n'était pas circoncis. L'expérience qu'il a vécue l'a amené à adopter des opinions anti-sionistes et c'est ainsi qu'il est devenu un objecteur de conscience et qu'il a refusé de servir dans l'armée israélienne.
[2]
M. Suhatski a demandé l'asile au Canada en raison de son origine russe, de son statut d'objecteur de conscience et du fait qu'il n'est pas circoncis. Il a également prétendu que, à titre de personne bisexuelle, il était victime de discrimination fondée sur l'orientation sexuelle. Sa demande était fondée sur les articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, L.C. 2001, ch 27 [LIPR] (voir l'annexe).
[3]
Un tribunal de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a rejeté la demande de M. Suhatski en raison d'un manque d'éléments de preuve et de l'existence de la protection de l'État en Israël. M. Suhatski conteste les conclusions de la Commission en prétendant que celle-ci a injustement omis de tenir compte de la preuve documentaire qu'il a soumis après son audience et, par ailleurs, parce qu'elle s'est fiée injustement à une preuve documentaire dont il ne connaissait pas l'existence. Il prétend également qu'elle a rendu une décision déraisonnable. Il me demande d'annuler la décision de la Commission et d'ordonner la tenue d'une nouvelle audience relativement à sa demande.
[4]
Selon moi, la Commission n'a pas traité M. Suhatski de façon inéquitable et n'a pas rendu une décision déraisonnable. La preuve documentaire que celui-ci a fournie après l'audience n'était pas importante et il en va de même pour la preuve extrinsèque que la Commission a consultée. De plus, les conclusions que la Commission a tirées étaient étayées par la preuve et, par conséquent, étaient raisonnables. Par conséquent, je ne vois aucun motif pour infirmer la décision de la Commission et je dois rejeter la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[5]
Il y a deux questions en litige en l'espèce:
1. La Commission a-t-elle traité M. Suhatski de façon inéquitable?
2. La décision de la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
II.
La décision de la Commission
[6]
La Commission a examiné les allégations de M. Suhatski selon lesquelles il aurait été victime de mauvais traitements en raison de son statut d'Israélien non juif d'origine russe, de son statut d'objecteur de conscience, de son orientation sexuelle et de sa crainte de la circoncision. Elle a ensuite examiné la possibilité pour les personnes qui se trouvent dans la situation de M. Suhatski de se prévaloir de la protection de l'État en Israël.
a) Mauvais traitements à titre d'Israélien d'origine russe
[7]
La Commission a souligné que pour que de mauvais traitements soient considérés comme étant de la persécution, ils doivent être infligés à répétition, ou avec persistance, ou de façon systématique et les prétendus mauvais traitements doivent fondamentalement mettre en péril les droits fondamentaux de la personne du demandeur d'asile. Le harcèlement et la discrimination peuvent ne pas équivaloir à de la persécution.
[8]
La Commission a conclu que rien, autre que les déclarations de M. Suhatski, n'étayait ses allégations. De plus, les prétendu mauvais traitements auraient été infligés pendant que M. Suhatski fréquentait l'école primaire ou secondaire. La Commission n'était pas d'avis que ces actes équivalaient à de la persécution.
[9]
La Commission n'a rien trouvé dans la preuve documentaire existante qui puisse justifier les allégations de M. Suhatski. Il y a environ un million d'immigrants provenant de l'ancienne Union soviétique [AUS] qui vivent en Israël, et environ 300 000 d'entre eux ne sont pas juifs. La Commission a souligné que « [p] eu d'information sur des cas de discrimination contre des immigrants de l'ancienne Union soviétique (AUS) a été trouvée ». De plus, le ministère israélien de l'Immigration et de l'Intégration offre toute une gamme de services en russe aux immigrants.
[10]
La Commission a conclu que les enfants immigrants ont parfois de la difficulté à s'établir en en Israël et s'adonnent davantage à la délinquance, l'absentéisme scolaire et la toxicomanie. Toutefois, rien ne prouve que les immigrants de l'AUS sont victimes d'intimidation délibérée ou systémique dans les écoles en Israël. De plus, ils ne sont pas exposés à des mauvais traitements ou à des actes de violence. Une section spéciale du protecteur du citoyen fournit des services aux enfants provenant de l'AUS.
[11]
Par conséquent, la Commission a conclu qu'aucune preuve documentaire ne corroborait les mauvais traitements que M. Suhatski prétend avoir subis en conséquence de son ascendance russe.
b) Persécution subie à titre d'objecteur de conscience
[12]
La Commission a reconnu la croyance profonde de M. Suhatski dans les droits de la personne et sa prétention selon laquelle l'armée israélienne aurait violé les droits de la personne par ses activités militaires à Gaza. Par conséquent, M. Suhatsi « estime que servir au sein de cette armée [l]e rendrait complice de ses crimes et, sur le plan politique, [il est] en désaccord avec Israël en ce qui concerne la mainmise sur [l]es territoires occupés et la prise de Gaza ». Toutefois, la Commission a conclu que M. Suhatski n'était membre d'aucun groupe opposé aux actions militaires d'Israël, que ce soit avant ou après avoir quitté Israël, et qu'il n'a jamais publiquement exprimé ses opinions.
[13]
À l'audience, M. Suhatski a affirmé dans son témoignage qu'il n'aurait aucune objection à servir dans l'armée si elle ne commettait aucun crime de guerre. La Commission a estimé que cette déclaration était incompatible avec sa déclaration antérieure selon laquelle il ne servirait pas du tout dans l'armée. La Commission a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, M. Suhatski n'avait pas une opinion profonde et sincère qui cadre avec le fait d'être un objecteur de conscience et n'avait fourni aucune preuve objective convaincante à cet égard.
c) Persécution fondée sur l'orientation sexuelle
[14]
M. Suhatski a dit dans son témoignage qu'il n'avait jamais eu aucune relation amoureuse, que ce soit avec un homme ou avec une femme, en Israël ou au Canada. Il avait déjà embrassé une fille au Canada deux ans auparavant. Selon la Commission, il était déraisonnable qu'il n'ait fait mention d'aucune relation dans son exposé écrit afin d'étayer sa prétention relative à l'orientation sexuelle.
[15]
La Commission a reconnu qu'il n'était pas facile de déterminer l'orientation sexuelle d'une personne, compte tenu qu'il s'agit de quelque chose « d'ancré dans ses sentiments profonds ». Mais, elle a également souligné que rien dans la preuve ne permettait de conclure que M. Suhatski était homosexuel ou bisexuel. Bien qu'il eût fourni la preuve de sa participation à des activités liées à la fierté gaie, la Commission lui a accordé peu de poids parce que n'importe qui peut participer à ces événements.
[16]
Enfin, la Commission a souligné que M. Suhatski avait affirmé dans son témoignage que, à titre de personne bisexuelle, il pouvait vivre en sécurité à Tel-Aviv. Par conséquent, l'orientation sexuelle n'était pas un véritable problème.
d) La prétention fondée sur la circoncision
[17]
La Commission a conclu que les allégations de M. Suhatski selon lesquelles on lui aurait infligé des mauvais traitements en raison de son refus de se faire circoncire n'avaient aucun fondement. Elle a conclu que la preuve ne portait que sur les conséquences de la circoncision sur le plan médical et anatomique et non pas sur son statut en Israël. La Commission n'a également trouvé aucune preuve documentaire étayant cette question dans sa documentation sur la situation dans le pays. Elle a effectué une recherche au centre juif de ressources sur la circoncision (Jewish Circumcision Resource Center) et a conclu que la circoncision n'est pas nécessairement la source de l'identité juive ou de sa force, qu'aujourd'hui une minorité de juifs choisissent de ne pas se faire circoncire et que la circoncision a perdu sa signification d'acte sacré.
e) La protection de l'État
[18]
La Commission a également conclu que M. Suhatski n'avait fourni aucune preuve claire et convaincante de l'absence de protection de l'État. Premièrement, la Commission a relevé divers mécanismes et divers organismes gouvernementaux auxquels on peut avoir recours en Israël afin de régler un problème d'actes discriminatoires comme ceux dont M. Suhatski prétend avoir été victime:
• L'Association pour les droits civils en Israël (Association for Civil Rights in Israel) traite les plaintes déposées par les Israéliens qui estiment que leurs droits de la personne ont été violés;
• Le Bureau de l'ombudsman (Office of the Ombudsman) examine les plaintes déposées contre les organismes gouvernementaux, les institutions de l'État, les gouvernements régionaux et autres organismes; toute personne peut déposer une plainte dans la langue de son choix, en personne ou par Internet.
[19]
Deuxièmement, en ce qui concerne sa prétention selon laquelle il est un objecteur de conscience, la Commission a conclu que M. Suhatski disposait de recours après avoir reçu ses ordres d'appel en 2006. La politique en vigueur à l'époque faisait une distinction entre l'objection « totale » au service, découlant du pacifisme, et l'objection « sélective », découlant d'une objection politique à des politiques précises. Les personnes qui appartiennent à la première catégorie ont été exemptées du service militaire, alors que celles qui appartiennent à la dernière catégorie pouvaient être traduites en justice et condamnées à une peine d'emprisonnement pour avoir refusé de s'enrôler. Les personnes qui prétendent être objecteurs de conscience ont droit à une audience devant un comité spécial.
[20]
De plus, le commissaire aux appels publics (Public Appeals Commissioner) sert d'intermédiaire entre l'armée et les civils. Il s'occupe des plaintes déposées par des soldats ainsi que les demandes de report et d'exemption du service militaire.
[21]
La Commission a conclu que M. Suhatski ne s'était prévalu d'aucun de ces recours avant de quitter Israël. Il a dit qu'il connaissait l'existence du comité qui s'occupe des objecteurs de conscience, mais il estimait qu'il comportait de graves lacunes. Il s'est fié à des renseignements qui lui avaient été donnés par un certain Dr Sergey Sandler-Yogev. La Commission a souligné que les titres de compétence de cette personne n'ont pas été établis et que son affidavit n'était pas objectif. Elle a accordé peu de poids à cet élément de preuve.
[22]
La Commission a également fait mention de la présomption bien connue selon laquelle l'État est capable de protéger ses citoyens. Israël est une démocratie dotée d'un appareil judiciaire indépendant et d'une armée contrôlée par des civils. La Commission a conclu que M. Suhatski ne s'était pas acquitté du fardeau de démontrer que l'État ne voulait pas ou n'était pas capable de le protéger.
[23]
De plus, la Commission a souligné que le service militaire obligatoire, en soi, ne constitue pas de la persécution. Dans les pays où le service militaire est obligatoire, la poursuite en justice et l'incarcération des objecteurs de conscience ne constituent pas de la persécution.
f) L'article 97
[24]
En plus de prétendre être un réfugié au sens de la Convention, M. Suhatski prétend être une personne à protéger au sens de l'art. 97 de la LIPR en raison d'un risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités en Israël. La Commission a conclu que les sanctions et les pénalités dont M. Suhatski pourrait faire l'objet pour avoir évité le service militaire étaient prévues par des lois générales adoptées par un état légitime. Elle a conclu que rien ne prouvait que les peines qui pouvaient lui être infligées étaient excessives ou non conformes aux normes internationales et, par conséquent, la demande fondée sur l'article 97 de la LIPR a également été rejetée.
III.
La Commission a-t-elle traité M. Suhatski de façon inéquitable?
a) Les documents déposés après l'audience
[25]
M. Suhatski se plaint que les documents qu'il a soumis à la Commission après la tenue de l'audience ont été refusés à tort. De plus, la Commission n'a donné aucune raison pour avoir refusé d'accepter les éléments de preuve additionnels.
[26]
Ces éléments de preuve portaient sur ce qui suit:
• La situation générale qui prévaut en Israël et dans les territoires occupés;
• Le traitement des Israéliens non-juifs d'origine russe;
• Le traitement des Palestiniens qui vivent sous l'occupation.
[27]
M. Suhatski affirme que ces éléments de preuve étaient directement liés à sa demande.
[28]
Après avoir examiné ces éléments de preuve, je conclus que tout manquement à l'équité procédurale n'a pas porté à conséquence. La Commission a rejeté la demande présentée par M. Suhatski à titre d'Israélien d'origine russe parce que les mauvais traitements qu'il allègue avoir subis n'équivalaient pas à de la persécution. La preuve documentaire qu'il a soumise après l'audience fait mention de certaines difficultés que les Israéliens d'origine russe éprouvent parfois lorsqu'ils s'établissent dans certains endroits (à Bethléem, p.ex.) ou lorsqu'ils louent un logement (à Tel-Aviv, p.ex.). Cet élément de preuve n'a pas étayé son allégation de persécution.
[29]
De plus, la Commission a rejeté l'allégation de M. Suhatski selon laquelle il était un objecteur de conscience, non pas en raison d'un manque de preuve documentaire, mais parce que son témoignage n'était pas crédible, parce qu'il n'avait pas été établi qu'il avait refusé de servir dans l'armée pour des raisons de principe, et parce qu'il disposait de recours en Israël où il pouvait faire part de ses réserves concernant le service militaire.
[30]
Par conséquent, le refus de la Commission d'accepter ces éléments de preuve n'a eu aucune incidence importante sur sa décision (comme dans
Mobil Oil Canada Ltd .c. Office Canada-Terre-Neuve des hydrocarbures extracôtiers
, [1994] 1 RCS 202). M. Suhatski avait déjà présenté une preuve documentaire importante quant à ces questions. Les documents additionnels reprennent en grande partie ce dont la Commission était déjà saisie.
b) La preuve portant sur la question de la circoncision
[31]
M. Suhatski s'insurge contre le fait que la Commission s'est fiée à une preuve extrinsèque à laquelle il ne lui a pas été donné l'occasion de répondre. Il prétend que la preuve extrinsèque invoquée par la Commission provenait de sources américaines plutôt que de sources israéliennes et a été utilisée pour mettre son témoignage en doute.
[32]
M. Suhatski conteste également l'emploi par la Commission du mot « intéressée » pour décrire sa preuve relative à cette question et renvoie à de la jurisprudence qui met en garde contre l'utilisation de ce terme:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1re inst.);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA).
[33]
Selon moi, la Commission aurait dû demander à M. Suhatski de lui formuler des observations quant à la preuve extrinsèque sur laquelle elle s'était fiée et aurait dû éviter l'utilisation du terme « intéressée ». Toutefois, la preuve consultée par la Commission n'a pas eu une incidence importante sur sa conclusion selon laquelle la discrimination dont M. Suhatski s'était plaint n'équivalait tout simplement pas à de la persécution.
IV.
La décision de la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
a) L'évaluation faite par la Commission de la preuve documentaire
[34]
M. Suhatski allègue que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte de centaines de documents et d'articles, et ce, sans donner aucune explication. Ces documents comprenaient des renseignements portant sur les sujets suivants:
• Les violations des droits de la personne et les pratiques illégales de l'armée israélienne;
• L'utilisation répandue de la torture;
• L'invasion du Liban en 2006;
• L'attaque de Gaza en 2008 et le siège qui a suivi;
• L'attaque illégale de la flotte de Gaza en eaux internationales;
• La destruction de villages « équivalant à du nettoyage ethnique ».
[35]
M. Suhatski prétend que la décision de la Commission devrait être annulée parce qu'elle ne mentionne pas pourquoi elle rejetait ces éléments de preuve.
[36]
M. Suhatski dit également que la Commission a rejeté sans raison valable la déclaration sous serment du Dr Sandler-Yogev, et que ce document devrait être présumé véridique.
[37]
Manifestement, on ne peut pas s'attendre à ce que la Commission ait fait mention des nombreux documents qui ont été soumis en preuve. Ce qui compte pour que la décision de la Commission soit raisonnable, « c'est qu'il ressorte des motifs, considérés dans le contexte du dossier et des observations sur les questions en litige, que le juge a compris l'essentiel de l'affaire. Si c'est le cas, une description détaillée des éléments de preuve ou du droit n'est pas nécessaire ».:
R c R.E.M.,
2008 CSC 51, paragraphe 43; voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[38]
M. Suhatski n'a pas démontré que les éléments de preuve dont la Commission n'aurait pas tenu compte étaient importants ou avaient une valeur probante. Encore une fois, les principales questions en litige relatives à sa prétention selon laquelle il est un objecteur de conscience étaient la crédibilité et le manque d'éléments de preuve démontrant qu'il avait refusé de servir dans l'armée pour des raisons de principe. De plus, la Commission a conclu que la discrimination dont M. Suhatski a prétendu avoir été victime en Israël n'équivalait pas à de la persécution.
[39]
M. Suhatski n'a tout simplement pas démontré en quoi la preuve documentaire dont il n'aurait pas été tenu compte aurait été pertinente quant aux conclusions de la Commission. En ce qui concerne l'évaluation faite par la Commission de la déclaration assermentée du Dr Sandler-Yogev, la Commission a conclu qu'il faut lui accorder peu de poids parce que ses compétences n'ont pas été prouvées. C'est à la Commission qu'il revient de décider du poids qu'il faut accorder à la preuve.
[40]
De plus, l'affidavit confirme que M. Suhatski était perturbé par la perspective d'avoir à servir dans l'armée, en partie pour des « questions d'ordre idéologiques » qui étaient « plutôt nébuleuses à l'époque ». Ses opinions sont récemment devenues plus claires, mais le Dr Sandler-Yogev ne précise pas ce que sont ces opinions. Selon moi, cet affidavit étayait peu la prétention de M. Suhatski selon laquelle il était un objecteur de conscience.
b) L'analyse faite par la Commission de la prétention selon laquelle le demandeur est un objecteur de conscience
[41]
M. Suhatski souligne qu'il s'opposait au service militaire pour des motifs d'ordre moral et juridique liés aux politiques israéliennes et aux opérations militaires. Il soutient que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte de ces éléments de preuve et a plutôt conclu que parce qu'il n'avait joué aucun rôle actif dans l'un des groupes opposés aux politiques militaires d'Israël, il n'était pas véritablement un objecteur de conscience.
[42]
M. Suhatski invoque également sa participation au « New Profile List », une organisation israélienne opposée à l'occupation, dont le dirigeant, le Dr Sandler-Yogev, a confirmé que M. Suhatski avait des liens avec ce groupe et a fourni des renseignements sur les politiques militaires concernant les objecteurs de conscience.
[43]
De plus, M. Suhatski affirme que la Commission a été obligée de tenir compte de la preuve documentaire pour décider si le Guide du HCR s'applique en l'espèce. M. Suhatski reproche notamment à la Commission de ne pas avoir davantage tenu compte de la question de savoir s'il était un « objecteur de conscience sélectif », et il a invoqué
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA), paragraphe 38;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 2; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Le point de départ de cette analyse est le paragraphe 171 du Guide du HCR, qui est ainsi libellé:
N'importe quelle conviction, aussi sincère soit-elle, ne peut justifier une demande de reconnaissance du statut de réfugié après désertion ou après insoumission. Il ne suffit pas qu'une personne soit en désaccord avec son gouvernement quant à la justification politique d'une action militaire particulière. Toutefois, lorsque le type d'action militaire auquel l'individu en question ne veut pas s'associer est condamné par la communauté internationale comme étant contraire aux règles de conduite les plus élémentaires, la peine prévue pour la désertion ou l'insoumission peut, compte tenu de toutes les autres exigences de la définition, être considérée en soi.
[44]
Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Yves de Montigny a adopté l'analyse énoncée par la juge Anne Mactavish dans
Hinzman, Re
, 2006 CF 420, aux paragraphes 108 à 109, confirmée par 2007 CAF 171. La juge Mactavish a conclu que le paragraphe 171 du guide du HCR devait être interprété au regard du paragraphe 170. Cela l'a amenée à conclure que le paragraphe 171 comporte un volet objectif et un volet subjectif:
Le paragraphe 170 parle de la nature et de l'authenticité des convictions personnelles et subjectives de la personne concernée, tandis que le paragraphe 171 parle du statut objectif de « l'action militaire » en question. Cela signifie que, pour être visé par le paragraphe 170 du Guide, le demandeur doit refuser de servir dans l'armée en raison de ses convictions politiques, religieuses ou morales ou pour des raisons de conscience valables. En l'espèce, la Commission a admis que M. Hinzman entretenait des objections véritablement sincères et profondes à l'égard de la guerre en Irak et cette conclusion n'est pas contestée ici.
M. Hinzman a donc démontré qu'il était visé par le paragraphe 170 du Guide. Cela ne lui donne toutefois pas droit à la protection accordée aux réfugiés, étant donné que le paragraphe 171 énonce clairement qu'une conviction morale ou politique authentique ne permet pas toujours de justifier une demande de statut de réfugié. Le paragraphe 171 exige qu'il existe également des éléments de preuve objectifs démontrant que « le type d'action militaire auquel l'individu en question ne veut pas s'associer est condamné par la communauté internationale comme étant contraire aux règles de conduite les plus élémentaires ».
[45]
Selon moi, la Commission n'a commis aucune erreur en n'évaluant pas l'élément objectif du critère, parce qu'elle a conclu que M. Suhatski n'avait pas satisfait au premier volet du critère - il n'a pas pu démontrer que son opposition était profonde. La juge de Montigny a déclaré ce qui suit dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « Les personnes qui tentent par principe de se soustraire au service militaire sont réputées craindre d'être persécutées en raison de leurs opinions politiques ou religieuses. Mais si leurs motivations sont plus anodines [...] le demandeur ne pourra pas être considéré comme étant un réfugié au sens de la Convention » (paragraphe 60).
[46]
En l'espèce, la Commission a reconnu que M. Suhatski avait fait état de convictions profondes en matière de droits de la personne et d'un désaccord avec les politiques d'Israël à propos des territoires occupés, mais elle a néanmoins conclu que ses actions ne s'accordaient pas avec ses croyances. Elle a conclu que « [l] e témoignage du demandeur d'asile ne donn[ait] aucun poids à l'allégation de ce dernier voulant qu'il soit un objecteur de conscience ». La juge de Montigny a affirmé ce qui suit dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « j'aurais été disposé à m'en remettre à l'agente d'ERAR si le fondement de sa décision avait été la non-crédibilité de M. Lebedev et l'absence de preuve démontrant qu'il avait refusé de servir [...] en raison de principes » (paragraphe 61).
[47]
De plus, toute erreur de la part de la Commission dans ce domaine n'aurait eu aucune incidence sur sa conclusion indépendante selon laquelle M. Suhatski pouvait se prévaloir de la protection de l'État.
c) L'analyse faite par la Commission quant à la protection de l'État
[48]
M. Suhatski prétend que la conclusion de la Commission n'est pas étayée par la preuve. Il invoque une décision récente dans laquelle la Cour a conclu que la Commission avait commis une erreur en concluant qu'un Israélien d'origine arabe pouvait se prévaloir de la protection de l'État (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[49]
La décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> n'est pas pertinente en l'espèce. Les allégations mentionnées dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> étaient tout à fait différentes de celles dont il est question en l'espèce - le demandeur dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> avait fondé sa demande sur une crainte d'être persécuté par un groupe musulman extrémiste. La question de savoir si la Commission avait commis une erreur en concluant que ce demandeur ne pouvait pas se prévaloir de la protection de l'État n'a aucune pertinence quant à la question de savoir si la conclusion de la Commission en l'espèce était raisonnable.
[50]
En l'espèce, la Commission a mentionné qu'il existe en Israël un certain nombre d'organismes gouvernementaux, de programmes et de mesures de protection auxquels peuvent avoir recours les personnes qui prétendent être victimes de discrimination à titre de non-juifs et les personnes qui demandent à être exemptés du service militaire parce qu'elles sont objecteurs de conscience. M. Suhatski ne conteste pas ces conclusions directement et je ne vois aucune raison de les modifier.
d) L'analyse faite par la Commission de la discrimination cumulative à titre de persécution
[51]
M. Suhatski prétend que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte d'éléments de preuve étayant sa demande fondée sur la discrimination cumulative et n'a pas tenu compte de la discrimination contre les non-juifs en Israël.
[52]
M. Suhatski n'a soumis aucun motif de croire que les éléments de preuve qu'il invoque auraient modifié la conclusion ultime de la Commission. En ce qui concerne la discrimination cumulative, la Commission a conclu que le traitement dont M. Suhatski s'est plaint n'équivalait pas à de la persécution, que ses craintes n'étaient pas fondées objectivement et qu'il existe en Israël une protection de l'État adéquate contre ce genre de traitement. Les observations de M. Suhatski ne visent pas directement l'une ou l'autre de ces conclusions.
V.
Conclusion et dispositif
[53]
Je conclus que la Commission n'a pas traité M. Suhatski de façon inéquitable. Elle n'a pas non plus rendu une décision déraisonnable compte tenu de la preuve dont elle était saisie. Sa conclusion était transparente, intelligible, et pouvait se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Par conséquent, je dois rejeter la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire.
