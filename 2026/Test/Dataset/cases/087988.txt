[1]
McVeigh, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of the decision of Louise Paquette-Neville, a member of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board (the Board), pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act). The Board dismissed the Applicants' claim for refugee protection, concluding that they were not convention refugees or persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
I.
Background
[2]
The Applicants are Hungarian citizens of Roma ethnicity, consisting of a father (Principal Applicant) and his common-law spouse, their daughter and son. They are aged 27, 26, 5, and 3, respectively. The family resided in Sajozsentpeter which is a small city close to Miskolc, the third largest city in Hungary. The Principal Applicant was employed as a nursing assistant in Miskolc.
[3]
Their Personal Information Form (PIF) included a three-paragraph personal narrative dated December 29, 2010 that said that living in Hungary is no longer bearable for the Applicants due to ongoing threats, abuse and discrimination stemming from their Roma ethnicity.
[4]
A three-page amendment to the original PIF was provided to the Board on May 10, 2012. In the amended narrative, the Applicants allege three instances where the Applicants faced persecution:
a) The first of these incidents occurred in August, 2010. The Principal Applicant alleges the Applicants were verbally threatened by five ethnic Hungarians at a playground in their hometown of Sajozsentpeter;
b) The second incident occurred on October 10, 2010. The Applicants went to the neighbouring town of Miskolc and accidentally encountered an anti gypsy rally where participants verbally threatened them. A coke bottle hit their son. The Principal Applicant was pushed against a bus stop, which injuring his hand;
c) The third incident occurred on November 21, 2010. The Principal Applicant says that he was walking in Sajozsentpeter with his friend Kotai Otto, when some skinheads threatened them before stabbing his friend Otto. As a result of his wounds, Otto died in his arms. The Applicants left the day after the funeral and arrived in Canada and applied for refugee protection on December 2, 2010.
II.
Issue
[5]
The issue raised in the present application is:
A. Was the Board's state protection analysis reasonable?
III.
Standard of review
[6]
The Board's finding with regards to state protection is reviewable on the standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[7]
When reviewing a decision on the reasonableness standard, the Court must determine whether the Board's findings fall within the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47). Although there may be more than one possible outcome, as long as the Board's decision-making process was justified, transparent and intelligible, a reviewing court cannot substitute its own view of a preferable outcome ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 59).
IV.
Analysis
A.
The Appropriate Framework for the State protection Analysis
[8]
The appropriate test for state protection in the context of subsections 96(a) and 97 (1)(b)(I) of the Act was stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
... a claimant seeking to rebut the presumption of state protection must adduce relevant, reliable and convincing evidence which satisfies the trier of fact on a balance of probabilities that the state protection is inadequate.
[9]
The state is not required to provide perfect protection to all citizens all of the time (
Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  99 DLR (4th) 334).
B.
Seeking Protection from Police and Non-Police Organizations
[10]
There is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens and that the more democratic the state, the more an applicant must do to show what it had done to exhaust all courses of action open to it (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[11]
The Principal Applicant argued that he went to the police regarding the three incidents and argues he had no relief so going more times would have garnished the same results. The Applicants argue that it is operational adequacy on the ground not efforts that matter and in this case police or other agencies do nothing so there is no reason to go to them.
[12]
The Principal Applicant said he went to the police to report the August, 2010 incident of verbal abuse that occurred in the playground. When he went to the police station they asked if he could prove anything that happened and asked for descriptions of the perpetrators. When the Principal Applicant told the police they were the only witnesses, the police did not even write anything down. At the hearing he was asked if there was any where else to turn to address the lack of police response and he said the minority self-government in Sajozsentpeter, but they say that the judicial system will believe the police over them. The complaint was not pursued further.
[13]
The Board found that this was abhorrent treatment but that the issue of racism cannot be addressed overnight. The Board did find that the state was addressing discrimination through legislation and on the ground by providing venues in which complaints can be addressed. The Board found these measures to be operationally adequate. The Board found that the Applicants had not made reasonable attempts to address the discrimination and they did not demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence that state protection was inadequate with relation to the incident that occurred.
[14]
The Principal Applicant testified that on October 10th, 2010, his family went to Mickolc to enjoy themselves and they walked into a rally. The Principal Applicant's son was hit on the head with a coke bottle and the Principal Applicant injured his hand. The Principal Applicant reported the incident to the police in Sajozsentpeter where he lived rather than in Mickolc where the incident occurred. He said he was too afraid to report to the police in Mickolc. The Principal Applicant could not provide the police with a description other that they were Guardists and racist people. The Principal Applicant testified that the police did not seem interested. The Board asked why he reported it to his home and he said he thought the police would contact the Mickolc police. The Principal Applicant followed up 2-3 weeks later at the Sajoszentpeter police station and the receptionist said the person in charge was not in. He did not return as he felt they did not treat it the same as if an ethnic Hungarian filed the report.
[15]
The Board found that he could not give the police a description of who threw the bottle other than a general description of Guardists. The Board noted that he said in his amended PIF that he attended a hospital to have his hand attended to and he told them what happened but no one really seemed to pay attention. The panel sympathized with the Applicants but found it unreasonable to expect the police to investigate when lack of sufficient evidence regarding the perpetrator. The Board found that on a balance, the police and state are addressing this increased violence.
[16]
In November, 2010 when the Principal Applicant's friend was stabbed while walking with him. The police arrived about when the ambulance did. He was so emotional he said he could not talk to the police other than to tell them it was a "big bald guy who worked out". The day following this incident, the Principal Applicant attended the police station to provide a statement. He was unable to obtain a copy of the report. The day after the funeral the Applicants left for Canada. When his mother attended the police station to get a copy of his statement they told her they had been looking to talk to him. The Principal Applicant's mother told him that the police attended his former residence in Hungary in January or February of 2011 looking for him. The Principal Applicant assumes this visit was connected to the investigation of Otto's death. The Principal Applicant testified that in March 2012, his mother told him that she received a threatening letter addressed to the Principal Applicant at his former address in Hungary. The Principal Applicant assumed that this letter was sent by someone connected to the death of Otto. The Board assigned little weight to the note as it was 2 years later on unsigned paper with newspaper letter pasted on it and mailed to him by his mother.
[17]
When the Board questioned him he said he did not think he had to attend a hearing or any judicial matter.
[18]
The Board found that at a minimum the Applicants departure did not assist the police in identifying who the perpetrator was and that this was unreasonable given he knew his brined had an altercation with someone from the neighbourhood 3 weeks prior. The Board found his departure to be premature given the state's interest in taking his statement and that they attended his home and he was a witness to the attack.
[19]
It is very difficult to argue the state is not protecting you when you do not enable them in anyway such as giving descriptions to them of alleged attackers and to follow up with police regarding the attacker that killed your friend (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The police cannot solve crimes where there is little if any evidence to investigate or to respond to.
[20]
The Applicants cannot rebut a presumption by only asserting subjective reluctance to engage the state or other bodies legislated to assist operationally (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is more understandable when the police are the alleged perpetrators but that was not the case on these facts.
C.
Board Considering all Relevant Evidence
[21]
I find that the Board conducted a thorough very detailed and full review of the documentary evidence in coming to its decision on state protection contrary to the Applicants' suggestions that it completely disregarded the documentary evidence supportive of the Applicants. There is no evidence to support that claim.
[22]
Likewise I do not agree with the Applicants that their testimonial evidence was completely disregarded by the Board. The Board addresses each of the Applicants' main claims of persecution; the incidents in August, October and November 2010 and the resulting police response. In addition it considers the secondary incidents of concern regarding the Principal Applicant's daughter kindergarten, the medical treatment of the Principal Applicant's son and father that were not argued at this hearing.
D.
Board Reasonably Assessing the Evidence
[23]
The Board considered the mixed country condition evidence. They were aware of the shortcomings of protection for Roma in Hungary. Their decision that protection though not perfect was adequate was available for them to make on the evidence before them. The decision was detailed analysis of the documentary evidence that considered and weighed it against the facts in this case.
[24]
The Board in reviewing the specific circumstances of these Applicants did not find this family faced personalized risk of harm under section 97 of the Act. The Board found that the Applicants "failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence and that the claimants did not take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to avail themselves of that protection before making a claim for refugee protection".
[25]
Each case must be determined on its own facts as established by the evidence. The Applicants filed the recent cases of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . All were matters involving Roma with successful judicial reviews. I agree with those cases, but there continue to be recent cases where the judicial reviews have not been successful for Roma in Hungary. This strengthens the argument that it is a very factual determination and that each case will be reviewed on their own facts.
[26]
On these facts, I find that the Board came to a conclusion that based on the evidence is a transparent, justifiable and intelligible result within the range of reasonable outcomes based on the evidence before it ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47 and
Khosa,
at para 46).
JUDGMENT
[27]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed; and
2. No question of general importance is certified.
.........................
Gyorgy Riczu, Terezia Haraszt,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue par Louise Paquette-Neville, commissaire à la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et de la protection des réfugiés (la Commission), en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi). La Commission a rejeté la demande d'asile présentée par les demandeurs et a conclu qu'ils n'étaient pas des réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni des personnes à protéger au titre des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.
I.
Le contexte
[2]
Les demandeurs - le père (le demandeur principal), sa conjointe de fait, leur fille et leur fils - sont des citoyens hongrois d'origine rom. Ils ont 27, 26, 5 et 3 ans, respectivement. La famille vivait à Sajozsentpeter, une petite ville près de Miskolc, la troisième plus grande ville de la Hongrie. Le demandeur principal était infirmier auxiliaire à Miskolc.
[3]
Leur Formulaire de renseignements personnels (le FRP) incluait un exposé circonstancié de trois paragraphes, daté du 29 décembre 2010, qui mentionnait que la vie en Hongrie n'était plus supportable pour les demandeurs en raison des menaces, des mauvais traitements et de la discrimination tenaces qu'ils subissaient à cause de leur origine rom.
[4]
Le 10 mai 2012, les demandeurs ont présenté à la Commission un ajout de trois pages au FRP original. Dans l'exposé circonstancié modifié, les demandeurs décrivent trois situations où, selon leurs allégations, ils ont été victimes de persécution:
a) le premier de ces incidents est survenu en août 2010. Le demandeur principal allègue que cinq Hongrois de souche ont proféré des menaces contre les demandeurs à un terrain de jeux dans leur ville d'origine de Sajozsentpeter;
b) le deuxième incident est survenu le 10 octobre 2010. Les demandeurs sont allés à la ville avoisinante de Miskolc et ont croisé par hasard un rassemblement antitzigane dont les participants leur ont proféré des menaces. Leur fils a été frappé par une bouteille de Coca-Cola. Le demandeur principal a été poussé contre un arrêt d'autobus, si bien qu'il s'est blessé à la main;
c) le troisième incident s'est produit le 21 novembre 2010. D'après le demandeur principal, il se promenait dans Sajozsentpeter avec son ami Kotai Otto lorsque des skinheads les ont menacés avant de poignarder son ami Otto. Ce dernier est mort dans ses bras. Les demandeurs ont quitté le pays le lendemain des funérailles et sont arrivés au Canada où ils ont demandé l'asile le 2 décembre 2010.
II.
La question en litige
[5]
La question soulevée dans le cadre de la présente demande est la suivante:
A. L'analyse de la protection de l'État effectuée par la Commission était-elle raisonnable?
III.
La norme de contrôle
[6]
La norme de contrôle applicable à la conclusion de la Commission concernant la protection de l'État est la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 29;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 59 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 51 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
[7]
Lorsqu'elle examine une décision selon la norme de la raisonnabilité, la Cour doit déterminer si les conclusions de la Commission appartiennent aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47). Bien qu'il puisse y avoir plus d'une issue possible, dans la mesure où le processus décisionnel de la Commission est justifié, transparent et intelligible, le tribunal de révision ne peut y substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 59).
IV. Analyse
A.
Le cadre approprié pour l'analyse de la protection de l'État
[8]
Le critère applicable pour analyser la protection de l'État dans le contexte de l'alinéa 96
a
) et du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(i) de la Loi a été exposé dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[...] le demandeur d'asile qui veut réfuter la présomption de la protection de l'État doit produire une preuve pertinente, digne de foi et convaincante qui démontre au juge des faits, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la protection accordée par l'État en question est insuffisante.
[9]
L'État n'est pas tenu d'assurer une protection parfaite à tous ses citoyens en tout temps (
Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  99 DLR (4th) 334).
B.
Demander la protection d'organisations policières et autres
[10]
Il y a une présomption voulant que l'État soit en mesure de protéger ses citoyens et que plus cet État est démocratique, plus le fardeau du demandeur est grand pour ce qui est de démontrer qu'il a épuisé toutes les mesures de recours à sa disposition (
Canada (Procureur général) c Ward
, [1993] 2 RCS 689, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[11]
Le demandeur principal a soutenu qu'il était allé à la police à la suite des trois incidents et n'avait obtenu aucune assistance, si bien qu'il aurait été inutile d'y retourner de nouveau. Les demandeurs font valoir que c'est l'efficacité sur le terrain qui compte, et non les efforts, et que, dans le présent dossier, la police et les autres organismes ne font rien, si bien qu'il n'y a aucune raison d'y avoir recours.
[12]
Le demandeur principal affirme être allé à la police pour signaler l'incident de violence verbale survenu au terrain de jeux en août 2010. Au poste de police, on lui a demandé s'il était en mesure de prouver ses dires et de décrire les agresseurs. Lorsque le demandeur principal a indiqué à la police qu'ils étaient les seuls témoins, la police ne s'est pas donné la peine de consigner quoi que ce soit par écrit. À l'audience, à la question de savoir s'il y avait d'autres autorités vers lesquelles il aurait pu se tourner à la suite de l'inaction de la police, il a signalé l'administration autonome minoritaire de Sajozsentpeter; toutefois, selon le demandeur principal, on dit que le système judiciaire accorde plus de foi à la police qu'à l'administration. Il n'y a pas eu de suite à la plainte.
[13]
La Commission a conclu qu'il s'agissait là d'un traitement odieux, mais que le problème du racisme ne pouvait être réglé du jour au lendemain. Elle a conclu que l'État s'attaquait à la discrimination en adoptant des mesures législatives et, de façon concrète, en mettant en place des lieux de règlement des plaintes. De l'avis de la Commission, ces mesures étaient suffisantes sur le plan pratique. La Commission a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas fait d'efforts raisonnables pour régler la discrimination et qu'ils n'avaient pas démontré, au moyen d'une preuve claire et convaincante, que la protection de l'État était inadéquate concernant l'incident en question.
[14]
Selon le témoignage du demandeur principal, le 10 octobre 2010, sa famille s'est rendue à Mickolc pour s'amuser et elle a croisé un rassemblement. Le fils du demandeur principal a reçu une bouteille de Coca-Cola sur la tête et le demandeur principal a subi une blessure à la main. Le demandeur principal a signalé l'incident à la police de Sajozsentpeter (la ville où il habitait), plutôt qu'à celle de Mickolc (où l'incident s'était produit). Il a affirmé qu'il avait trop peur de se présenter au service de police de Mickolc. Le demandeur principal n'était pas en mesure de fournir aux policiers une description autre que les agresseurs étaient des membres de la Garde et des racistes. Selon le témoignage du demandeur principal, les policiers ne semblaient pas intéressés. En réponse au commissaire qui lui a demandé pourquoi il avait signalé l'incident dans la ville où il habitait, il a répondu qu'il pensait que les policiers communiqueraient avec la police de Mickolc. Le demandeur principal est retourné au poste de police de Sajoszentpeter deux ou trois semaines plus tard pour faire le suivi de sa plainte, mais le réceptionniste lui a dit que la personne chargée du dossier était absente. Il n'est pas retourné, car il estimait que les policiers ne traitaient pas l'incident comme ils l'auraient fait si un citoyen d'origine hongroise l'avait signalé.
[15]
La Commission a conclu qu'il n'avait pas été en mesure de fournir à la police une description de la personne qui avait lancé la bouteille, à part une description générale des membres de la Garde. Elle a noté que, selon le FRP modifié, le demandeur principal s'était rendu à un hôpital pour faire soigner sa main et avait signalé au personnel hospitalier ce qui était arrivé, mais que personne ne semblait vraiment prêter attention. Le tribunal éprouvait de la sympathie pour les demandeurs, mais a conclu qu'il était déraisonnable de s'attendre à ce que la police fasse enquête quand elle ne disposait pas d'éléments de preuve suffisants concernant l'agresseur. La Commission a conclu que, tout compte fait, la police et l'État prennent des mesures pour contrer cette violence accrue.
[16]
En novembre 2010, lors de l'incident où l'ami du demandeur principal a été poignardé pendant qu'ils marchaient ensemble, la police est arrivée à peu près en même temps que l'ambulance. Selon le demandeur principal, il était tellement bouleversé qu'il n'était pas capable de parler à la police, sauf pour leur dire que l'agresseur était un [traduction] « grand chauve qui fait de la musculation ». Le lendemain de l'incident, le demandeur principal s'est rendu au poste de police pour faire une déclaration. Il n'a pas pu obtenir une copie du rapport. Le lendemain des funérailles, les demandeurs sont partis pour le Canada. Lorsque sa mère est allée au poste de police pour chercher une copie de la déclaration, les policiers lui ont dit qu'ils voulaient parler au demandeur principal. La mère du demandeur principal lui a dit que les policiers étaient venus à son ancienne résidence en Hongrie en janvier ou février 2011 pour tenter de le trouver. Le demandeur principal présume que cette visite était liée à l'enquête sur la mort d'Otto. Selon le témoignage du demandeur principal, en mars 2012, sa mère lui a dit qu'elle avait reçu une lettre de menaces adressée au demandeur principal à son ancienne adresse en Hongrie. Le demandeur principal a présumé que cette lettre provenait d'une personne associée au meurtre d'Otto. La Commission a attribué peu de poids à cette note, car elle remontait à deux ans après l'incident, ne portait pas de signature, avait été composée à l'aide de lettres découpées dans des journaux et avait été postée au demandeur principal par sa mère.
[17]
En réponse aux questions de la Commission, il a indiqué qu'il ne pensait pas avoir à comparaître à une audience ou à une affaire judiciaire.
[18]
La Commission a conclu que, à tout le moins, le départ des demandeurs n'avait pas aidé la police à identifier l'agresseur et que cela était déraisonnable, étant donné qu'il savait que son ami avait eu une altercation avec quelqu'un du voisinage trois semaines auparavant. La Commission a conclu que le départ du demandeur principal avait été hâtif, puisque l'État souhaitait recueillir sa déclaration, que les policiers s'étaient rendus chez lui et qu'il avait été témoin de l'agression.
[19]
Il est très difficile de soutenir que l'État ne vous protège pas quand vous n'aidez pas les autorités en leur fournissant des descriptions des prétendus agresseurs et que vous omettez de faire un suivi auprès des policiers concernant l'agresseur qui a tué votre ami (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La police ne peut pas résoudre des crimes lorsqu'il y a peu d'éléments de preuve, voire aucun, pour mener l'enquête.
[20]
Les demandeurs ne peuvent réfuter une présomption en ne faisant qu'affirmer leur réticence subjective à faire appel à l'État ou à d'autres organismes chargés par la loi de leur venir en aide (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Une telle réticence est plus compréhensible lorsque les policiers sont les prétendus agresseurs, mais ce n'est pas le cas en l'espèce.
C.
L'examen de tous les éléments de preuve pertinents par la Commission
[21]
Je conclus que la Commission a mené un examen exhaustif et très détaillé de la preuve documentaire afin de rendre sa décision concernant la protection de l'État, contrairement aux insinuations des demandeurs selon lesquelles elle aurait complètement fait fi de la preuve documentaire favorable aux demandeurs. Il n'y a pas de preuve à l'appui de ces insinuations.
[22]
De même, je ne souscris pas à l'avis des demandeurs selon lequel la Commission a complètement fait abstraction de leurs témoignages. La Commission a examiné chacune des principales allégations de persécution présentées par les demandeurs, soit les incidents survenus en août, en octobre et en novembre 2010, ainsi que les mesures prises par les policiers en réponse à ces incidents. De plus, elle a examiné les incidents secondaires ayant trait à l'école maternelle de la fille du demandeur principal et au traitement médical du fils et du père du demandeur principal - des incidents qui n'ont pas fait partie de la preuve présentée par les demandeurs en l'espèce.
D.
L'appréciation raisonnable de la preuve par la Commission
[23]
La Commission a examiné les éléments de preuve non concordants au sujet de la situation en Hongrie. Elle était au fait des lacunes de la protection accordée aux Roms en Hongrie. Sa décision - à savoir que la protection est adéquate, même si elle n'est pas parfaite - pouvait être rendue à la lumière de la preuve à sa disposition. La décision découlait d'une analyse détaillée de la preuve documentaire dans le cadre de laquelle cette preuve a été examinée et appréciée à la lumière des faits de l'espèce.
[24]
Après avoir examiné la situation particulière des demandeurs, la Commission a conclu que les membres de cette famille n'étaient pas personnellement exposés à un préjudice au sens de l'article 97 de la Loi. La Commission a conclu que les demandeurs « n'[avaient] pas réfuté la présomption de la protection de l'État au moyen d'une preuve claire et convaincante et qu'ils n'[avaient] pas pris toutes les mesures raisonnables dans les circonstances pour se réclamer de cette protection avant de présenter une demande d'asile ».
[25]
Chaque cas doit être tranché sur la base des faits qui lui sont propres, tels qu'ils ont été établis par la preuve. Les demandeurs ont cité de récentes décisions:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Ces trois décisions avaient trait à des Roms dont la demande de contrôle judiciaire avait été accueillie. Je souscris à ces décisions, mais il continue d'y avoir des décisions où la Cour rejette les demandes de contrôle judiciaire présentées par des Roms de la Hongrie. Cela confirme que de telles décisions reposent fortement sur les faits et que chaque cas doit être examiné en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres.
[26]
D'après les faits de l'espèce, je conclus que la Commission a tiré une conclusion qui, à la lumière de la preuve, est transparente, justifiable et intelligible et qui appartient aux issues acceptables eu égard à la preuve dont elle disposait ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47 et
Khosa,
au paragraphe 46).
