Teitelbaum, J.
: This is an application for an order setting aside the decision of the National Parole Board of Canada (the Board), dated March 18, 1993, whereby the Board denied statutory release to the applicant, Thomas J. McBride, and ordered him detained for later gradual release.
[2]
In the Originating Notice of Motion, the applicant indicated that the application was based on the following grounds:
1. The National Parole Board decision amounts to double-jeopardy against the applicant.
2. The National Parole Board decision is contrary to the principles of natural justice.
3. The belief allegedly formed by the Commissioner of Corrections cannot be supported on the criteria designated in s. 129(3) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
.
4. Paragraph 132(1)(b) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
is unconstitutional.
[3]
At the hearing of this application, counsel for the applicant advised that it will be his submission that the Board did not properly apply the tests set out in s. 130 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, S.C. 1992, c. 20 (the
Act
) and that the Corrections Branch did not properly follow the procedures set out in s. 129 of the
Act
.
Background
[4]
The applicant is 34 years old and is currently serving a 17 year, 3 month and 3 day aggregate sentence at Kent Institution, commencing December 12, 1977, for a variety of offences, including robbery, robbery with violence, armed robbery, attempted robbery and break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence. In November 1988, while on mandatory supervision, the applicant robbed a Vancouver bank armed with a 12 inch knife with an approximate 8 inch blade. At the time of this robbery, the applicant was serving an 11 year sentence for armed robbery, robbery with violence and a number of related offences. On April 19, 1989, a six year concurrent sentence for the robbery offence was imposed to the unexpired portion of the applicant's sentence. The applicant was due for statutory release on March 1, 1993 and his Warrant expires in April 1995.
[5]
A review of the applicant's criminal record reveals that the applicant has spent a majority of his adult life in various federal correctional institutions. I am also convinced from a review of the evidence that, if and when released, he will act in such a manner that he will spend most of the rest of his life in federal correctional institutions. I am satisfied the applicant is a "danger" to society. The applicant also has an extensive psychiatric history and throughout his years of incarceration has been hospitalized at Regional Psychiatric Centres in the "aftermath of self-destructive acts", including slashing his arms, neck, hanging attempts and self-inflicted head injuries. The applicant has been on various anti-psychotic medication.
[6]
On January 21, 1990, the applicant was transferred from Matsqui Institution on an emergency basis to the Regional Psychiatric Centre (R.P.C.). It was noted in the applicant's Progress Summaries that while the applicant was in the controlled therapeutic environment of the R.P.C. there were sufficient external control mechanisms to stabilize his behaviour.
[7]
On September 30, 1992, a Psychological Assessment of the applicant was completed by Robert G. Ley, Ph.D. (Ley). In his report (Exhibit C of the MacAdams Affidavit), Ley writes:
"The results of psychological testing, and my impressions from the clinical interview yield a consistent picture of Mr. McBride as
an extremely socially maladjusted person, with a severe personality disorder at best
. I find indications of avoidant, self defeating and passive aggressive features in his personality, and these findings are verified by psychological test results. They converge on a picture of a person who can be clinically described as 'schizotypal'.
. . . . .
"From a descriptive and case management standpoint, Mr. McBride
is best viewed as a mentally disordered offender
. Despite his likeability, and seeming harmlessness (towards others) while he is incarcerated, he has a very negative prognosis. The negative factors include his extreme institutionalization; his criminal identity and enjoyment of a criminal lifestyle (and the momentary pleasures that it brings him).
. . . . .
"Although Mr. McBride appears to be developing some insights, and as well, I suspect he is more intelligent than he is given credit for, in unstructured settings, such as the community, he has been strikingly lacking in self control. Obviously, such poor self control is accentuated by his predisposition to abuse alcohol.
"In short, it is my view that
Mr. McBride represents a very significant risk to reoffend
. Historically, he has quickly reoffended, whenever he has been released to the community.
He has now a well established pattern of robbing banks, and I suspect would turn readily to similar criminality
, if he needed money. Thus, Mr. McBride is not ready for day parole. However, it is an even more difficult task to determine what can be done for Mr. McBride in order to increase his suitability for day parole ..." (Emphasis added)
[8]
On October 14, 1992, the applicant was granted a three month Unescorted Temporary Absence Program (UTA) contingent on his successful transfer to Mission Institution. The applicant remained at the R.P.C. until his transfer to Mission Institution on October 27, 1992. Mission Institution is viewed as a medium security institution. As the applicant was a new inmate at Mission Institution, the UTA grant was not acted upon. However, on December 16, 1992, the applicant was granted an eight hour Escorted Temporary Absence to visit with his brother. The visit occurred without incident. While at Mission Institution the applicant obtained institutional employment in the kitchen and received good work reports.
[9]
On January 13, 1993, the applicant was transferred on an emergency warrant to Kent Institution (a maximum security institution) following an incident at Mission Institution, where the applicant assaulted a correctional officer. The applicant was subsequently charged and convicted of an assault on a Peace Officer. The incident arose when the applicant was confronted by a correctional officer about smoking a cigarette in a non-smoking area. The applicant was warned, there were some words, and when the correctional officer turned away, the applicant struck the officer in the jaw. Both fell to the floor, and the applicant proceeded to strike the officer several more times, before a food Services Officer and an inmate kitchen worker pulled the applicant off the officer. When the applicant was interviewed regarding the incident, he indicated he did not want to discuss the incident in any detail as legal proceedings had been instituted. The applicant did however state that he felt provoked by the correctional officer and had not been taking his prescribed daily medication. The applicant later indicated that his daily medication was only to deal with the side effects of his monthly medication. I am satisfied this excuse could not be viewed as a mitigating factor. The correctional officer was treated for minor injuries and the hospital reported that he suffered from minor strain to both arms with possible tendon damage to his left arm. The officer also suffered from internal jaw pain. The correctional officer also took considerable time off work because of his injuries.
[10]
On February 18, 1993, a referral was made by the Commissioner of Corrections (the Commissioner) to the Chairperson of the Board pursuant to s. 129(3) of the
Act
for a detention review on the basis that the Commissioner had concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe the applicant is likely to commit an offence causing death or serious harm to another person before the expiration of his sentence.
[11]
On February 25, 1993, the applicant's interim detention hearing was conducted in accordance with s. 129(5) of the
Act
. At the hearing, an order was made detaining the applicant pending a full hearing before the Board pursuant to s. 129(7) of the
Act
.
[12]
As a result of the incident with the correctional officer, a report was prepared by Joseph A. Noone, Clinical and Consulting Psychiatrist (Noone), dated February 27, 1993, (Exhibit A to the McBride affidavit and Exhibit O to the MacAdams affidavit). Noone examined the applicant on February 23, 1993. In his report, Noone writes:
"My diagnosis is fully consistent with a diagnosis of the 'Schizotypal' personality described by Dr. Ley, with this man's psychotic behaviour being restricted to a few brief psychotic reactions when situationally stressed in a prison setting ...
"Despite a number of psychotic episodes he does not, in my view, fit the criteria for schizophrenia ...
"
He represents a significant risk to reoffend
. This risk and particularly the risk for more serious recidivism will be best dealt with by a gradual release programme along the lines I have discussed, rather than any form of precipitous release. He is the sort of mentally disordered patient who does best with a 'client centred' rather than any form of 'paternalistic' approach ... In fact, I would be inclined, whilst he is still in a controlled setting to withdraw the anti-psychotic medication and to reserve it for any psychotic relapses that may occur, rather than to use it in a prophylactic way ..." (Emphasis added)
[13]
A full hearing was held before the Board on March 18, 1993 and a detention Order was made by the Board. The Board's reasons for decision are reproduced below:
"The Board has concluded you meet Criterion C (that if released the applicant would be likely to commit an offence causing death of or serious harm to another person before the expiration of his sentence). You have shown by your offences of robbery and your assaultive behaviour during your break and enter, all of which in the Board's view caused psychological harm to your victims. These offences occurred while you were on release programmes. Your physical altercation with a corrections officer in Mission after your transfer from the controlled and therapeutic surroundings to the Regional Psychiatric Centre to the lesser structure of Mission, occurred at a time when you were on medication to control psychotic behaviour. The whole of your history indicates that you have difficulties controlling violent impulses. There is psychiatric and psychological evidence of likelihood of your causing serious harm to another person. See in particular the psychological report of 1992 September 30 and the psychiatric report of 1993 February 25 which indicate you are subject to psychotic episodes which you are unable to control.
"The Board has reviewed the option of residency in a community based residential facility. The Board does not view your risk as manageable on special residency.
"The Board recommends you follow the programmes presented to you, especially those suggested by Dr. Noone."
According to the MacAdams affidavit, the following documents were considered by the Board in making their decision:
1) Criminal Convictions and related information for Mr. McBride;
2) Progress Summary dated June 11, 1992;
3) Report of Psychologist, Robert G. Ley, dated September 30, 1992;
4) National Parole Board Decision dated October 14, 1992 granting Mr. McBride unescorted temporary absences upon conditions once transferred to medium security Mission Institution and denying him full parole;
5) Progress Summary dated January 25, 1993;
6) Progress Summary dated February 9, 1993;
7) Memo from the Warden of Mission Institution to Deputy Commissioner of the Pacific Region dated January 29, 1993;
8) Memo from the Deputy Commissioner of the Pacific to the acting Commissioner dated February 11, 1993;
9) Memo from the Commissioner, Correctional Service of Canada to chairperson National Parole Board dated February 18, 1993;
10) Letter from chairperson National Parole Board to Regional Director Pacific Region of National Parole Board directing a hearing in this matter dated February 18, 1993;
11) Letter from Mike Halco of National Parole Board to Brenda Lamm of Kent Institution dated February 18, 1993 advising of Interim Detention Hearing and asking that copies of certain documents be provided to Mr. McBride;
12) Copy of letter from Halco to Lamm with acknowledgment of service of Mr. McBride noted thereon dated February 24, 1993;
13) Notification of National Parole Board decision after interim hearing ordering Mr. McBride detained pending full hearing dated February 25, 1993;
14) Notification of National Parole Board decision detaining Mr. McBride after full hearing dated March 18, 1993;
15) Report of Dr. Noone dated February 27, 1993.
[14]
The applicant indicated that the above noted documents were made available to him prior to the hearing of March 18, 1993.
Applicant's Position
[15]
The applicant based his argument on the procedures outlined in s. 129 of the
Act
, which the Corrections Branch must follow with respect to any inmate who is coming due for release on parole. Specifically, s. 129(2) requires that, not later than six months before the release date, the Correctional Service (the Service) refer the inmate's case to the Board. Section 129 of the
Act
also sets out the procedure the Commissioner must follow with respect to an inmate to seek his/her continued detention. The applicant submits that the relevant provision in the case before me is s. 129(3) of the
Act
.
[16]
As the applicant was due for release on parole on March 1, 1993, the referral would have to have been made prior to September 1, 1992. At that time, prior to September 1, 1992, the Service would make an application to the Board and notify the applicant of the intention to seek his continued detention. This referral would be made on the basis of the applicant's past record.
[17]
The applicant argues that no such belief was formed prior to the six month period, and if there was, it was not acted upon prior to the six months as required by the
Act
.
[18]
The applicant submits that the criteria for review by the Board are outlined in s. 130, specifically paragraph 130(3)(c) of the
Act
. The applicant maintains that the Commissioner must form a belief according to s. 129 and s. 129 imposes a six month limit prior to the release date during which something must be done in terms of the Board, i.e., that the Service must take action to bring the applicant before the Board and state that the Commissioner has formed the belief that the applicant is likely to commit, if released, an offence causing death or serious harm to another person, and should not be released on his parole date. The applicant notes that September 1, 1992, passed and there was no application to the Board. Therefore, submits the applicant, the Service must not have formed such a belief regarding the applicant. The applicant further submits that the Service, and therefore the Commissioner, did not have any information prior to September 1, 1992 which would have allowed him or her to form the belief that the applicant was likely to commit these offences if released.
[19]
The applicant argues if the six month period passes and the Commission has not formed such a belief, then there would have to be another incident, or a triggering event, which would be sufficient to give the Commissioner a reasonable belief that the applicant, if released, would likely commit an offence which would cause death or serious harm. In the case before me, the triggering incident was the assault on the correctional officer.
[20]
The applicant submits that it would be unfair to the applicant for the Board to equate the charge of simple assault, albeit of a peace officer, to the requirements set out in paragraph 130(3)(c) that the applicant is likely, if released, to cause death or serious harm. In other words, in the circumstances of this case, where the six month period has passed, and there is an event such as "simply assault" the Board should not review the applicant's history in coming to the decision to further detain the applicant. As I understand it, the applicant is asserting that it would be unfair for the Board to take into account the applicant's history after the six month period, when they had the opportunity to do so prior to the six month period. If there had been a concern regarding the applicant's background and a belief that he should not be released on his parole date, the Service and the Commissioner should have proceeded with an application to continue the applicant's detention before the Board prior to the six month period. According to the applicant, had there been a concern about the applicant's early release on parole, the applicant has the right to know of his status as far in advance as possible, and Parliament has legislated the time frame to be at least six months.
[21]
With respect to "unfairness", the applicant submits that the unfairness lies in the fact that the Service equated assault on a peace officer, which the applicant seems to view as a summary conviction offence and therefore not serious. As such, the criteria set out in paragraph 130(3)(c), that the applicant if released, is likely to cause death or serious harm, was not met. Serious harm as defined in the
Act
includes severe physical injury or severe psychological damage. The applicant submits that as "serious" was included in the criteria, there is a higher degree of onus on the Service to show that any particular inmate is likely to cause serious harm to another person if released prior to the expiration of his sentence. The applicant maintains that if the Service had such a belief, that the applicant was likely to cause serious harm, based on his actions during his previous offences, then the Service should have brought the application before the Board before the six months, which they did not do. This, argues the applicant, shows that the Service was not concerned about the applicant's previous history. Therefore, the only concern to the Service, was the triggering event, namely the assault on the corrections officer. The applicant once again argues that to equate the assault as equivalent to the criteria set out in paragraph 130(3)(c) was "stretching the point".
[22]
The applicant also argues that even if the applicant's record, meaning his penitentiary record and the information contained herein, including Dr. Noone's report, were considered by the Board, it does not necessarily follow from the statement that the applicant represents a significant risk to reoffend, that the applicant is likely to cause serious harm to another person if released early.
Respondent's Position
[23]
The respondent argues that s. 129(3) of the
Act
deals with the case at bar as the referral was made, within the six month period, based on a triggering event, namely the assault on the correctional officer. As the actions of the applicant became a concern to the Service, the Commissioner was therefore entitled to make the referral to the Chairperson of the Board, pursuant to paragraph 129(3)(a) of the
Act
.
[24]
The respondent noted that under the
Act
, the Board may order the offender not be released before the expiration of his sentence, if the Board is satisfied that the offender is likely, if released, to commit an offence causing death or serious harm to another person before the expiration of his sentence. The factors that are to be considered by the Board are referred to in s. 132 of the
Act
. Section 132 provides that the Board shall take into consideration any factor that is relevant to determining the likelihood of the commission of the offence causing death or serious harm to another person, and includes a pattern of persistent behaviour established on the basis of any evidence, and in particular the number of offences committed, the seriousness of the offence, information regarding the offender such as any difficulty controlling violent impulses, and the use of a weapon in the commission of an offence. The Board can also consider medical, psychiatric or psychological evidence. This submits the respondent, is the framework in which the Board is required to carry out its mandate and is exactly what the Board did when it came to the decision to detain the applicant until his release date.
[25]
The respondent argues that Noone's report was only one of the documents referred to by the Board when it made its decision. The respondent maintains that the list of documents referred to in the MacAdams affidavit represents all the evidence that the Board is statutorily mandated or required to look at in making its determination.
[26]
The respondent submits that based on the assault and Noone's report, the Commissioner had not only a right but a statutory obligation to make the referral to the Board.
[27]
The respondent notes, as did the applicant, that "serious harm" includes not just physical harm but also emotional damage or psychological damage. In this regard, the respondent referred specifically to the applicant's robbery offence, when he approached a bank teller with a knife and jumped over the counter, as well as the break and enter when the applicant broke into a woman's home and removed his clothing while in her bedroom and then threw a blanket over her.
[28]
Essentially, the respondent's position is that the Service had every right to make the referral to the Board, and once the referral was made, the Board was entitled to look at the applicant's penitentiary record, including the information and documents listed in the MacAdams affidavit.
[29]
In terms of the hearing before the Board, the respondent submits there was no denial of natural justice. The applicant was provided with the information that was before the Board and given an opportunity to respond to the information, both personally and through his counsel. Indeed, the transcript showed that the Board raised particular concerns with the applicant and the applicant was given every opportunity to respond. The respondent maintains that the Board was more than fair with the applicant and based on the totality of the evidence made a reasonable decision to detain the applicant until his release date.
Discussion
[30]
After a review of the applicant's submissions, I believe the applicant's argument is that given the fact the Service was aware of the applicant's record, before the six month period prior to his statutory release date, the Service must not have been concerned about a possibility that the applicant, if released early, would likely cause serious harm. However, within the six month period the applicant assaulted a correctional officer and was convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The applicant asserts that in the circumstances of this case, it was unreasonable for the Board to equate this assault with the likelihood that the applicant, if released, would cause serious harm, as defined in the
Act
. The applicant also maintains that the procedures were not followed in accordance with s. 129 of the
Act
.
[31]
The relevant portions of s. 129 are reproduced below.
"129(1) Before the statutory release date of an offender who is serving a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more that includes a sentence imposed for an offence set out in Schedule I or II that was prosecuted by way of indictment, the Commissioner shall cause the offender's case to be reviewed by the Service.
"129(2) After the review of the case of an offender pursuant to subs. (1), and not later than six months before the statutory release date, the Service shall refer the case to the Board together with all the information that, in its opinion, is relevant to it, where the Service is of the opinion
(a) in the case of an offender serving a term of imprisonment that includes a sentence for an offence set out in Schedule I, that
. . . . .
(ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit an offence causing death or serious harm to another person before the expiration of the offender's sentence according to law;
. . . . .
"129(3) Where the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that an offender who is serving a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more is likely, before the expiration of the sentence according to law, to commit an offence causing death or serious harm to another person or a serious drug offence, the Commissioner shall refer the case to the Chairperson of the Board together with all the information in the possession of the Service that, in the Commissioner's opinion, is relevant to the case, as soon as practicable after forming that belief, but the referral may not be made later than six months before the offender's release date unless
(a) the Commissioner formed that belief on the basis of behaviour of the offender during the six months preceding the statutory release date or on the basis of information obtained during those six months;
. . . . .
"129(5) Where the case of an offender is referred to the Chairperson of the Board pursuant to subs. (3) during the six months preceding the statutory release date of the offender, or on or after that date, the Board shall
. . . . .
(b) if the case is referred to the Chairperson during the four weeks preceding that date but more than three days before that date,
(i) review the case pursuant to subs. 130(1) before that date, if possible, or
(ii) make an interim review of the case before that date; or
. . . . .
"129(7) On completion of an interim review pursuant to subs. (5), if the Board is of the opinion, on the basis of all the information provided, that a sufficient case is made for a review pursuant to subs. 130(1), the Board shall conduct a review of the case as soon as practicable and not later than four weeks after the case was referred to the Chairperson of the Board."
[32]
Clearly the case before me falls within the provisions of s. 129(3) of the
Act
. This was a referral by the Commissioner to the Chairperson of the Board, not a referral by the Service to the Board. I agree that normally the referral is to be made prior to the six month period, however, paragraph 129(3)(a) allows for the referral to be made within the six months prior to the statutory release date, where the Commissioner formed the belief that the offender would likely cause death or serious harm to another person or commit a serious drug offence, on the basis of the offender's behaviour during the six month period or on the basis of information obtained during that period. In the case at bar, the belief was that the applicant would likely commit an offence causing serious harm. According to the definition section of the
Act
, "serious harm" means severe physical injury or severe psychological damage.
[33]
Therefore, the first matter to be determined is whether the Commissioner properly formed the belief in order for a referral to be made to the Chairperson of the Board pursuant to s. 129(3) of the
Act
, that the applicant if released early would likely commit an offence causing serious harm, meaning severe physical injury or severe psychological damage.
[34]
In terms of procedure, as the Commissioner formed the belief on the basis of the behaviour of the offender during the six months preceding his statutory release date (according to the referral, the date was February 26, 1993) as well as on information obtained during the six month period, and as the case was referred to the Chairperson of the Board on February 18, 1993, an interim hearing was scheduled, in accordance with paragraph 129(5)(b) of the
Act
for February 25, 1993. A decision was reached at the interim hearing to continue the applicant's detention pending the full hearing before the Board. In accordance with s. 129(7) of the
Act
the full hearing was held on March 18, 1993.
[35]
The Commissioner indicated in the referral that his conclusion was based on following new information as identified in paragraph 129(3)(a) of the
Act
. The referral reads as follows:
"On January 13, 1993, McBride assaulted a correctional officer at Mission Institution. The assault appears to have stemmed from an order to extinguish a cigarette in a nonsmoking area of the institution's kitchen. The officer sustained injuries which required treatment at a local hospital. The officer continues to suffer pain as a result of the assault and has taken considerable sick leave. McBride has been charged by the RCMP with Assaulting a Peace Officer and is awaiting trial. In addition, the Correctional Service received information regarding McBride's medical and psychological condition following his transfer from the Regional Psychiatric Centre to Mission Institution. This information, received less than six months prior to McBride's statutory Release Date support concerns about McBride's risk to the community.
"The deterioration of McBride's behaviour was not apparent prior to the six month referral because McBride was in a controlled and therapeutic environment at RPC which assisted him to function acceptably. McBride's transfer to Mission Institution introduced a number of stressful changes. These included a less structured and controlled environment, less attention from Health Care personnel and the introduction of an Unescorted Temporary Absence grant. These stressors and an impending Statutory Release Date may have contributed to McBride's assault on a correctional officer.
"McBride initially refused to be interviewed by a psychiatrist following the January 13, 1993 assault. However, he has since agreed to an interview which will occur within the near future. In the interim, it is noteworthy that the latest psychological report dated September 30, 1992, described McBride as '... an extremely socially maladjusted person with a severe personality disorder at best'.
"The same report also concluded:
'... McBride represents a very significant risk to reoffend. Historically, he has quickly reoffended, whenever he has been released to the community. He has now a well established pattern of robbing banks, and I suspect that he would turn readily to similar criminality, if he needed the money.'"
[36]
Section 132 of the
Act
provides that for purposes of the review and determination of the case of an offender pursuant to ss. 129, 130 or 131, the Service, the Commissioner or the Board, as the case may be, shall take into consideration
any factor
in determining the likelihood of the commission of offence causing death or serious harm to another person before the expiration of the offender's sentence. The factors include: a pattern of violent behaviour established on the basis of evidence, in particular, the number of offences committed causing physical or psychological harm, the seriousness of the offence, reliable information demonstrating that the offender has had difficulty controlling violent impulses, the use of a weapon in the commission of any offence, a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender as to the consequences to other persons of the offender's behaviour; medical, psychiatric or psychological evidence of such likelihood owing to a physical or mental illness or disorder of the offender; and the availability of supervision programs that would offer adequate protection to the public from the risk the offender might otherwise present.
[37]
Therefore, under the paragraph 129(3)(a) of the
Act
, the Commissioner's belief is formed on the basis of the offender's behaviour or information obtained during that period, and would include a consideration of any factor or factors noted above.
[38]
The applicant referred to this court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.C.C.(3d) 256 (T.D.), to support the proposition that the six month period forms a procedural safeguard for an offender about to be released. In other words, if the Service did not have any knowledge or information which would cause the Commissioner or form a belief that the applicant, if released was likely to cause death or serious harm, then fairness would dictate that he/she should be precluded from referring to that knowledge or information. In this regard, the applicant made reference to the following comments at page 268 of
Ford
[C.C.C.]:
"... It seems to me that it is the content of the new information that must be obtained within that period (the six month period); it must be 'new' in the sense that the content be unknown both to the Commissioner and the service for which he is responsible prior to the six month period; it should come into their possession for the first time during that period. If it were otherwise and the Commissioner after the crucial date could rely on information previously known by the service or the Commissioner, then the procedural safeguard provided by the six month period, which is intended to provide due notice to the inmate in all but exceptional circumstances, would be meaningless."
[39]
The
Ford
case dealt with a referral by the Commissioner to the Chairman of the Board, pursuant to s. 21.3 of the
Parole Act
, which also provided that a referral must be made not later than six months before the presumptive release date of the inmate. The
Parole Act
was repealed and replaced on November 1, 1992 (SI/92-197) by the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
. Under the
Parole Act
, a referral to the Board could be made where a number of conditions were met. However, the Commissioner also had the power to refer a matter to the Chairperson of the Board, irrespective of whether the offence for which the inmate was then serving sentence caused the death or serious harm to another person where the Commissioner believed on reasonable grounds that the inmate was likely, prior to the expiration of the sentence he was then serving, to commit an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person. The referral was to be made no later than six months before the presumptive release date, unless the Commissioner formed the belief on the basis of, inter alia, "information obtained within those six months". In the
Ford
case, the referral was made by the Deputy Commissioner in the absence of the Commissioner on the basis of a psychiatric report. The psychiatrist who prepared the report had seen the applicant over ten years earlier and at that time concluded that the applicant's potential for "dangerousness" had decreased. After the six month deadline, the psychiatrist saw the applicant again and prepared a report in which he indicated that the applicant harboured a high potential for causing physical as well as psychological harm to others in the near future. The inmate, brought an application to quash the Commissioner's referral to the Board. The court concluded that the action taken by the individual acting as Commissioner of Corrections, in referring the inmate's case to the chairperson of the Board, was a proper exercise of discretion vested in the Commissioner under s. 21.3(3) of the
Parole Act
.
[40]
I have difficulty accepting the applicant's submissions regarding the
Ford
decision. MacKay, J., noted that the authority of the Commissioner to act after the six month period was related to his forming the belief on reasonable grounds based on information obtained after that date that, prior to the expiration of the sentence Ford was serving, he was likely to commit an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person. MacKay, J., also commented that the statute did not specify that the information be "new" in any particular sense. He noted there was no requirement that the information be created or that it originated or was commissioned in the six months prior to the presumptive release date. The information must be "new" in the sense that the content was unknown to both the Commissioner and the service prior to the six month period, it should come into their possession for the first time during this period. However, the court concluded that there was a possible basis for the Commissioner forming his belief after the six month period about the likelihood of further serious offences being committed by Ford, based at least in part on information obtained after that date from Dr. Akhtar's report. At page 268, MacKay, J., also stated:
"In this case I am not persuaded that the Commissioner was without any basis to form a belief on reasonable grounds, based on Dr. Akhtar's report which was obtained by the service after the crucial date, that would support his referral under s. 21.3(3) to the chairman of the Board. It is said for the applicant that report merely supported or confirmed the view or opinion already reached, as early as the report of July 18th by the case management team and in this sense was not new or obtained within the six month period. Yet Dr. Akhtar's report is open to a different interpretation, that goes beyond mere support of the conclusion of service officers for it does provide a professional opinion, of a forensic psychiatrist, of the psychiatric condition of the applicant and the tendencies to particular conduct this may generate, and that opinion, is different from the same psychiatrist some 12 years earlier. The earlier opinion was known to the service, the later one was not known for Dr. Akhtar had not examined Ford before the important date here, September 27th."
[41]
Therefore, although there is a procedural safeguard formed by the six month period, it is not absolute.
[42]
Further, a court may only interfere, by way of certiorari, if there is no evidence to support the Commissioner's conclusion that the information was obtained after the six month stipulation,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Collier, J.
[43]
Similarly, in the case before me, I am not persuaded that the Commissioner was without any basis to form the belief on the basis of the applicant's behaviour, the assault on the correctional officer and information obtained by the case management team report, within the six month period, that the applicant is likely to commit an offence causing death or serious harm if released prior to the expiration of his sentence. Although counsel for the applicant may choose to classify the assault as mere common assault, it can also be viewed as an indication of deterioration in the applicant's behaviour which occurred after the expiration of the six month period, and in that sense is new. Further, s. 132 of the
Act
clearly requires, for the purposes of a review pursuant to s. 129, including s. 129(3), that the Commissioner take into account
any
factor that is relevant in determining the likelihood of the commission of an offence causing death or serious harm to another person. The section goes on to provide a list of factors to be considered.
[44]
As such, I can find no procedural improprieties in the Commissioner's decision to refer the applicant's case to the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 129(3)(a) of the
Act
. I am also of the opinion, that there was a reasonable basis upon which the Commissioner could have formed the requisite belief after the six month date, based in part on the assault on the correctional officer and that the Commissioner properly considered the various information available to him, including the applicant's past history of offences, penitentiary record, medical and psychological reports. I can see no unfairness or unreasonableness in the Commissioner considering this information.
[45]
In terms of the Board's decision, s. 130 deals with the Board's review of cases referred to it by either the Service or the Commissioner. The relevant portions of s. 130 are reproduced below:
"130(1) Where the case of an offender is referred to the Board by the Service pursuant to subs. 129(2) or referred to the Chairperson of the Board by the Commissioner pursuant to subs. 129(3), the Board shall, subject to subss. 129(5), (6) and (7), at the times and in the manner prescribed by the regulations,
a) inform the offender of the referral and review, and
b) review the case,
and the Board shall cause all such inquiries to be conducted in connection with the review as it considers necessary.
. . . . .
"130(3) On completion of the review of the case of an offender referred to in subs. (1), the Board
(a) may order that the offender not be released from imprisonment before the expiration of the offender's sentence according to law,
. . . . .
where the Board is satisfied
. . . . .
(e) in the case of an offender whose case was referred to the Board pursuant to subs. 129(3), that the offender is likely, if released, to commit an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person or a serious drug offence before the expiration of the offender's sentence according to law."
[46]
For the purposes of the review, the Board is also required, pursuant to s. 132 of the
Act
, to take into account
any factor that is relevant
in determining the likelihood of the commission of an offence causing, in this case, serious harm, including severe physical injury and severe psychological damage, to another person before the expiration of the offender's sentence. As noted earlier, s. 132 refers to a pattern of persistent behaviour established on the basis of any evidence, including the number of offences, the seriousness of the offence, whether a weapon was used in the commission of the offence and information regarding the offender, whether he or she has difficulty controlling violent impulses. In my view, this clearly allows the Board to take into account the applicant's past history, including his criminal and penitentiary records. The Board specifically noted the applicant's robbery offences and his assaultive behaviour during the break and enter. During the review, the Board noted that there was no physical injury done to any person in the past but there was "the traumatization of the woman in 1985", "the acts of robbery involved traumatization, victimization".
[47]
Paragraph 132(1)(b) of the
Act
provides that medical, psychiatric or psychological evidence may also be considered by the Board. In the case before me, the Board had two such reports, that of Dr. Ley and Dr. Noone. Both Ley and Noone were of the opinion that the applicant represented a "significant risk to reoffend". These are professional opinions from a clinical and consulting psychologist and a clinical and consulting psychiatrist, respectively. In the case of the applicant, reoffend would cover his previous offences of robbery, robbery with violence, armed robbery and the break and enter. As previously stated, the break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence was the result of the applicant breaking into a woman's home and removing all his clothing while in her bedroom. Police reports indicated that the victim was extremely traumatized.
[48]
After a review of the evidence, I am satisfied there was information before the Board enabling it to make a determination that the applicant, if released, is likely to commit an offence causing serious harm to another person before the expiration of his sentence. In my view, the Board made a reasonable decision to detain the applicant until his release date.
[49]
I also agree with the respondent's submission that there was no denial of natural justice and that the Board was more than fair with the applicant. The applicant was provided with the information that was before the Board and was given ample opportunity to respond to this information, both personally and through his counsel.
[50]
This is clearly a case where the individual should be kept incarcerated in a maximum control setting, as long as the law provides.
[51]
I therefore conclude that there is no basis upon which to set aside the Board's decision and the application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
