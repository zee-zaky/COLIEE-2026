I.
Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
: The Applicant seeks judicial review of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment [PRRA] decision, wherein it was determined that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
].
II.
Judicial Procedure
[2]
This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
IRPA
for judicial review of a PRRA decision, dated May 30, 2012.
III.
Background
[3]
The Applicant, Mr. Jaswinder Singh, a citizen of India, was born in 1958.
[4]
In February 2002, Indian police allegedly detained and tortured the Applicant and his brother, who was suspected of links to militants; they were released five days later when their family paid a bribe. His brother allegedly vanished in November 2002.
[5]
In January 2003, Indian police allegedly sought the Applicant upon learning that he was planning to file a complaint against them on his brother's disappearance.
[6]
With the assistance of an agent, the Applicant arrived in Canada on April 24, 2003 with a fraudulent passport. He claimed refugee protection on May 7, 2003.
[7]
On March 15, 2004, the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected the Applicant's refugee claim on credibility grounds. This Court refused leave for judicial review on June 24, 2004.
[8]
The Applicant applied for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds three times. His first application on H&C grounds was made on November 25, 2004 and rejected on October 23, 2007; his second on November 7, 2007 was rejected on September 30, 2008. The Applicant's third application on H&C grounds [H&C Application] was made on April 23, 2009.
[9]
In 2009, the Applicant's brother allegedly reappeared after escaping from different police stations in different regions where he had been detained.
[10]
On October 20, 2011, Indian police allegedly shot the Applicant's brother.
[11]
On January 5, 2012, the Applicant received notice advising him that he could apply for a PRRA.
[12]
On January 13, 2012, the Applicant filed an application for a PRRA.
[13]
In his PRRA and H&C Applications, the Applicant submitted the following evidence that was not submitted in his refugee claim and earlier applications on H&C grounds: (i) the affidavit of Joginder Singh Mohalla, dated March 13, 2009 [Mohalla Affidavit]; (ii) the affidavit of Charanjit Kaur, dated March 13, 2009 [Kaur Affidavit]; (iii) the affidavit of Mohan Lal, dated January 24, 2012 [Lal Affidavit]; (iv) a copy of the Applicant's brother's death certificate [Death Certificate]; (v) a public notice published by the Applicant in a Hindi newspaper, dated 2012 [Notice]; (vi) country condition evidence on police impunity and state terrorism against Sikhs in India, dated July 29, 2010 and March 19, 2011; and, (vii) a decision of the Committee Against Torture, dated May 17, 2004 [CAT Decision].
[14]
On May 30, 2012, the Officer rejected the PRRA and H&C Applications.
IV.
Decision under Review
[15]
The Officer stated that PRRA applications are assessed on new facts or evidence demonstrating risk of persecution or torture, risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the PRRA Officer noted that a PRRA is not an appeal of an RPD decision but rather an assessment of new risks arising after a hearing.
[16]
The Officer did not accept the Mohalla and Kaur Affidavits as new evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
. The affidavits post-dated the RPD decision but reiterated facts and events that were the basis of the refugee claim. It was, according to the Officer, reasonable to expect that the Mohalla and Kaur Affidavits could have been presented to the RPD and the Applicant did not explain why they were not.
[17]
The Officer did not give probative value to the Lal Affidavit, which describes the alleged return and murder of the Applicant's brother. Formal defects exists in the affiant's failure to identify himself and to declare that he had first-hand knowledge which detracted from its probative value. The Officer also gave the Lal Affidavit little probative value as it was prepared nineteen days after the Applicant received notice to apply for a PRRA and was directly linked to allegations the RPD did not find credible.
[18]
The Officer did not give weight to the Death Certificate as it did not identify the cause of the registrant's death and lacked the reliability of an original.
[19]
No weight was given to the Notice as it did not establish that police murdered the Applicant's brother; it only gave notice to creditors of his brother's estate.
[20]
The Officer did not give weight to the country condition evidence in respect of the police, state terror, and Sikh militancy because it did not relate to the Applicant's personal situation or corroborate his allegations.
[21]
In the Officer's view, the CAT Decision did not have probative value because it was based on the circumstances of another individual and the Applicant did not demonstrate how it was relevant to his personal situation.
[22]
After reviewing other country condition evidence, the Officer found that the Applicant would not be subject to risk of persecution, torture, risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment of punishment in India. The Officer found that there was evidence of extrajudicial killings and torture by police and that an atmosphere of impunity existed in India due to weak law enforcement, a lack of trained police, and an overburdened court system. The Officer also noted evidence that Sikh militants may be at risk of detention and physical harm; but violence has significantly subsided in the relatively recent past. Nonetheless, the Applicant failed to establish that he would be persecuted by Indian authorities; nor did his application for refugee protection in Canada place him at risk. Country condition evidence did not demonstrate that Indian nationals returning home face adverse treatment solely because they have applied for asylum.
V.
Issues
[23]
(1) Was the Officer's refusal of evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
reasonable?
(2) Was the Officer's assessment of the evidence that it accepted as new evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
reasonable?
(3) Does a reasonable apprehension of bias arise from the PRRA process?
VI.
Relevant Legislative Provisions
[24]
The following provisions of the
IRPA
are relevant:
Convention refugee
96.
A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(

Person in need of protection
97.
(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally

(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,

(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
...
113.

[...]
[25]
The following provisions of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC, 1985, c F-7 are relevant:
57.
(1) If the constitutional validity, applicability or operability of an Act of Parliament or of the legislature of a province, or of regulations made under such an Act, is in question before the Federal Court of Appeal or the Federal Court or a federal board, commission or other tribunal, other than a service tribunal within the meaning of the National Defence Act, the Act or regulation shall not be judged to be invalid, inapplicable or inoperable unless notice has been served on the Attorney General of Canada and the attorney general of each province in accordance with subsection (2)
57.
(1) Les lois fédérales ou provinciales ou leurs textes d'application, don't la validité, l'applicabilité ou l'effet, sur le plan constitutionnel, est en cause devant la Cour d'appel fédérale ou la Cour fédérale ou un office fédéral, sauf s'il s'agit d'un tribunal militaire au sens de la Loi sur la défense nationale, ne peuvent être déclarés invalides, inapplicables ou sans effet, à moins que le procureur général du Canada et ceux des provinces n'aient été avisés conformément au paragraphe (2).
VII.
Position of the Parties
[26]
While agreeing that a PRRA is not a re-hearing of an RPD decision, the Applicant submits that non-refoulement is central to the PRRA regime. Since the
IRPA
aims to prevent deportation to a substantial risk of torture, the Officer was required to consider both the specific and country condition evidence that would demonstrate the risk of torture in India.
[27]
The Applicant argues that the Officer made credibility findings by having speculated, rather than having made a rational analysis of the evidence. Evidence of his detention and torture should have been analyzed in the context of country condition evidence of police impunity and state terror against suspected Sikh militants. The Applicant asserts that the Officer was required to consider the affidavit evidence as torture rarely takes place in public and affidavits do not necessarily lack weight simply because an affiant is interested.
[28]
The Applicant argues that, in the deportation context, administrative decision-making by decision-makers with little independence or expertise is inconsistent with sections 7 and 12 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part I of the
Constitution Act
,
1982
, being Schedule B to the
Canada Act
1982
(UK), 1982, c 11 [
Charter
] and Canada's international obligations on human rights. The Applicant also argues that limiting the evidence that can be considered in the PRRA context to new evidence under subsection 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
is also inconsistent with the
Charter
.
[29]
Finally, the Applicant claims that a reasonable apprehension of bias arises because PRRA decision-makers are systematically biased in favour of deportation.
[30]
The Respondent counters that the Officer's finding that evidence submitted by the Applicant was not new evidence within the meaning of paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
was reasonable. In support, the Respondent argues that the risks alleged by the Applicant were essentially the same as those rejected by the RPD.
[31]
The Respondent views the Officer's analysis of the country condition evidence as reasonable since the Applicant did not establish that he was a high-profile Sikh militant or that failed asylum seekers are at risk in India. Moreover, the Respondent adds that an applicant's claim may not be based on country condition evidence alone without a link between personal circumstances and that evidence.
[32]
The Respondent argues that the Supreme Court of Canada has held that the PRRA regime does not violate sections 7 and 12 of the
Charter
or Canada's international law obligations in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[33]
Finally, the Respondent argues that neither an institutional nor individual reasonable apprehension of bias arises from the PRRA process itself.
VIII.
Analysis
Standard of Review
[34]
The Officer's refusal to accept the Mohalla Affidavit, Kaur Affidavit, and the Lal Affidavit as new evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
is reviewable on the standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 291). The analysis of the new evidence is also reviewable on this standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[35]
Where reasonableness applies, the Court may only intervene if the reasons are not "justified, transparent or intelligible". To meet this standard, decisions must also fall in the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes ... defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47).
[36]
Whether a reasonable apprehension of bias arises is reviewable on a standard of correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 281).
[37]
Since section 57 of the
Federal Courts Act
precludes courts from ruling on constitutional questions where the notice requirement is not met, it is unnecessary to identify the standard of review on the
Charter
submissions. Failure to provide notice is "fatal since it is a
sine qua non
condition for entertaining the constitutional argument" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53).
(1)
Was the Officer's refusal of evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
reasonable
?
[38]
The Officer's finding that the Mohalla Affidavit, Kaur Affidavit, and Lal Affidavit were not new evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
was reasonable.
[39]
The Federal Court of Appeal set out the test for new evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[13] As I read paragraph 113(
a
), it is based on the premise that a negative refugee determination by the RPD must be respected by the PRRA officer, unless there is new evidence of facts that might have affected the outcome of the RPD hearing if the evidence had been presented to the RPD. Paragraph 113(
a
) asks a number of questions, some expressly and some by necessary implication, about the proposed new evidence. I summarize those questions as follows:
1.
Credibility
: Is the evidence credible, considering its source and the circumstances in which it came into existence? If not, the evidence need not be considered.
2.
Relevance
: Is the evidence relevant to the PRRA application, in the sense that it is capable of proving or disproving a fact that is relevant to the claim for protection? If not, the evidence need not be considered.
3.
Newness
: Is the evidence new in the sense that it is capable of:
(a) proving the current state of affairs in the country of removal or an event that occurred or a circumstance that arose after the hearing in the RPD, or
(b) proving a fact that was unknown to the refugee claimant at the time of the RPD hearing, or
(c) contradicting a finding of fact by the RPD (including a credibility finding)?
If not, the evidence need not be considered.
4.
Materiality
: Is the evidence material, in the sense that the refugee claim probably would have succeeded if the evidence had been made available to the RPD? If not, the evidence need not be considered.
5.
Express statutory conditions
:
(a) If the evidence is capable of proving only an event that occurred or circumstances that arose prior to the RPD hearing, then has the applicant established either that the evidence was not reasonably available to him or her for presentation at the RPD hearing, or that he or she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the RPD hearing? If not, the evidence need not be considered.
(b) If the evidence is capable of proving an event that occurred or circumstances that arose after the RPD hearing, then the evidence must be considered (unless it is rejected because it is not credible, not relevant, not new or not material).
[40]
It would be reasonable to find that the Mohalla and Kaur Affidavits failed on the fifth criterion of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. These affidavits only prove events arising before the RPD hearing. The Applicant did not establish that they were not reasonably available to him, or that he could not be reasonably expected to have presented them, at the time of the hearing.
[41]
While the Lal Affidavit meets the criterion of newness in discussing the return and subsequent murder by Indian police of the Applicant's brother, one could reasonably find that it was not new evidence under the materiality criterion.
[42]
While stating that the Lal Affidavit was new evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
, the Officer refused to give it probative value because it "reiterates facts and events that formed the basis of the applicant's refugee claim" and that the additions on his brother's alleged return and murder "are directly linked to a story found not credible by the RPD" (Certified Tribunal Record at p 9). This suggests that the Officer expressed him or herself imperfectly and did not consider the Lal Affidavit as new evidence.
[43] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, held that PRRA officers "may properly reject ... evidence if it cannot prove that the relevant facts as of the date of the PRRA application are materially different from the facts as found by the RPD" (at para 17). No material difference between the Applicant's allegations at his RPD hearing that he and his brother were detained and tortured for his brother's suspected Sikh militancy and the allegations in the Lal Affidavit that his brother was murdered for his suspected Sikh militancy. Since the RPD did not believe the Applicant's narrative, his claim "probably would [not] have succeeded" if the Lal Affidavit was available to the RPD (at para 13).
(2)
Was the PRRA Officer's assessment of the evidence that it accepted as new evidence under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
reasonable
?
[44]
The PRRA Officer's assessment of the new evidence accepted under paragraph 113(
a
) of the
IRPA
was reasonable. The Death Certificate and Notice did not identify the cause of the Applicant's brother's death and does not necessarily lead to the inference that he was murdered by Indian police. General country condition evidence cannot be a substitute for a direct specific linkage to an Applicant for the purpose of establishing personal risk to that of suspected Sikh militancy in India (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
(3)
Does a reasonable apprehension of bias arise from the PRRA process
?
[45]
The claim that a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias arises from the PRRA process itself since PRRA officers are pre-disposed to deport applicants cannot succeed. Justice Edmond Blanchard, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dismissed this same argument (at para 39).
IX.
Conclusion
[46]
For all the above reasons, the Applicant's application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[47]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
the Applicant's application for judicial review be dismissed. No question of general importance for certification.

[Traduction]: Le demandeur cherche à obtenir le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision concernant un examen des risques avant renvoi [ERAR] dans le cadre de laquelle il a été établi que le demandeur n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ou de personne à protéger aux termes des articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR].
II.
Instance
[2]
La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée conformément au paragraphe 72(1) de la LIPR, d'une décision relative à un ERAR rendue le 30 mai 2012.
III.
Contexte
[3]
Le demandeur, M. Jaswinder Singh, est un citoyen de l'Inde né en 1958.
[4]
En février 2002, la police indienne aurait détenu et torturé le demandeur et son frère parce qu'ils étaient soupçonnés d'entretenir des liens avec des activistes; ils ont été libérés cinq jours plus tard grâce à un pot-de-vin versé par des membres de leur famille. Son frère serait disparu sans laisser de traces en novembre 2002.
[5]
En janvier 2003, la police indienne se serait mise à la recherche du demandeur après avoir appris qu'il prévoyait déposer une plainte contre elle par suite de la disparition de son frère.
[6]
Avec l'aide d'un intermédiaire, le demandeur est arrivé au Canada le 24 avril 2003 muni d'un faux passeport. Il y a fait une demande d'asile le 7 mai 2003.
[7]
Le 15 mars 2004, la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur pour des motifs de crédibilité. Le 24 juin 2004, la Cour a rejeté la demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[8]
Le demandeur a fait trois demandes de résidence permanente fondées sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire (demandes CH). La première a été déposée le 25 novembre 2004 et a été rejetée le 23 octobre 2007; la deuxième, datée du 7 novembre 2007, a été rejetée le 30 septembre 2008. Enfin, la troisième a été déposée le 23 avril 2009.
[9]
En 2009, le frère du demandeur aurait refait surface après s'être enfui de divers postes de police régionaux où il avait été détenu.
[10]
Le 20 octobre 2011, la police indienne aurait fait feu sur le frère du demandeur.
[11]
Le 5 janvier 2012, le demandeur a reçu un avis l'informant qu'il pourrait présenter une demande d'ERAR.
[12]
Le 13 janvier 2012, le demandeur a déposé une demande d'ERAR.
[13]
Dans sa demande d'ERAR et ses demandes CH, le demandeur a déposé les éléments de preuve suivants qui ne l'avaient pas été dans sa demande d'asile et dans ses demandes CH antérieures: (i) affidavit de Joginder Singh Mohalla, daté du 13 mars 2009 [affidavit Mohalla]; (ii) affidavit de Charanjit Kaur, daté du 13 mars 2009 [affidavit Kaur]; (iii) affidavit de Mohan Lal, daté du 24 janvier 2012 [affidavit Lal]; (iv) copie du certificat de décès du frère du demandeur [le certificat de décès]; (v) avis publié par le demandeur dans un journal en hindi, daté de 2012 [l'avis]; (vi) documents sur la situation dans le pays concernant l'impunité de la police et le terrorisme d'État contre les Sikhs en Inde, datés du 29 juillet 2010 et du 19 mars 2011; et (vii) décision du comité contre la torture [CCT], datée du 17 mai 2004 [décision du CCT].
[14]
Le 30 mai 2012, l'agent a rejeté la demande d'ERAR et les demandes CH.
IV.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[15]
L'agent a déclaré que les demandes d'ERAR sont évaluées en fonction de faits ou d'éléments de preuve nouveaux qui démontrent l'existence d'un risque de persécution ou de torture, d'une menace à la vie des demandeurs ou du risque qu'ils soient exposés à des traitements ou peines cruels et inusités. Citant la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'agent d'ERAR a souligné qu'un ERAR n'est pas un appel d'une décision de la SPR, mais plutôt une évaluation des nouveaux risques qui peuvent surgir après la tenue d'une audience.
[16]
L'agent n'a pas considéré comme des éléments de preuve nouveaux au sens de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR les affidavits Mohalla et Kaur. En effet, les affidavits étaient postérieurs à la décision de la SPR mais reprenaient des faits et des événements qui constituaient le fondement de la demande d'asile. Selon l'agent, il était raisonnable d'estimer que les affidavits Mohalla et Kaur auraient pu être présentés devant la SPR; or, le demandeur n'a pas réussi à expliquer pour quelles raisons ils ne l'avaient pas été.
[17]
L'agent n'a pas accordé de valeur probante à l'affidavit Lal, qui contient les allégations concernant le retour et le meurtre du frère du demandeur. Cet affidavit présente des vices de forme parce que son auteur ne s'est pas identifié et n'a pas déclaré qu'il avait une connaissance directe des événements relatés, ce qui affaiblissait sa valeur probante. De plus, l'agent lui a aussi accordé une faible valeur probante étant donné qu'il avait été souscrit 19 jours après que le demandeur eut reçu l'avis concernant la possibilité de présenter une demande d'ERAR et qu'il se rapportait directement à des allégations que la SPR n'avait pas jugées crédibles.
[18]
L'agent n'a pas accordé de valeur probante au certificat de décès étant donné qu'il ne précisait pas la cause du décès et qu'il n'avait pas la fiabilité d'un document original.
[19]
Aucune valeur n'a non plus été accordée à l'avis étant donné qu'il n'établissait pas que c'était bien la police qui avait assassiné le frère du demandeur; en effet, il ne s'agissait que d'un avis à l'intention des créanciers de la succession de son frère.
[20]
L'agent n'a pas accordé de valeur probante aux éléments de preuve sur la situation dans le pays en ce qui concerne les forces policières, le terrorisme d'État et l'activisme sikh étant donné que ces éléments de preuve n'étaient pas liés à la situation personnelle du demandeur et ne corroboraient pas ses allégations.
[21]
Selon l'agent, la décision du CCT n'avait pas de valeur probante parce qu'elle était fondée sur la situation d'une autre personne et que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré le lien entre cette décision et sa situation personnelle.
[22]
Après avoir pris connaissance d'autres éléments de preuve sur la situation dans le pays, l'agent a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas exposé au risque d'être persécuté ou d'être soumis à la torture, d'être exposé à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités en Inde. L'agent a reconnu que des éléments de preuve confirmaient que les forces policières se livraient à des exécutions extrajudiciaires et à la torture et qu'il régnait une atmosphère d'impunité en Inde à cause des lacunes en matière d'exécution de la loi, du manque de formation des policiers et de l'engorgement du système judiciaire. L'agent a aussi souligné que les activistes risquaient bel et bien d'être détenus et de subir de mauvais traitements, mais que la violence avait diminué considérablement depuis un certain temps. Néanmoins, le demandeur n'a pas réussi à établir qu'il serait persécuté par les autorités indiennes et que sa demande d'asile au Canada l'exposait à des risques. La documentation sur la situation dans le pays n'a pas démontré que les ressortissants indiens de retour dans leur pays risquent de subir de mauvais traitements uniquement parce qu'ils ont déposé une demande d'asile.
V.
Questions en litige
[23]
(1) Est-ce que le refus de l'agent d'admettre les éléments de preuve présentés au titre de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR était raisonnable?
(2) Est-ce que l'évaluation par l'agent des éléments de preuve qu'il a acceptés comme nouveaux éléments de preuve au sens de l'alinéa
a
) de la LIPR était raisonnable?
(3) Est-ce que la procédure d'ERAR en cause donne lieu à une crainte raisonnable de partialité?
VI.

VII.
Arguments des parties
[26]
Tout en reconnaissant qu'un ERAR ne constitue pas une nouvelle instruction d'une décision déjà rendue par la SPR, le demandeur soutient que le principe du non-refoulement est un élément central du régime d'ERAR. Étant donné que la LIPR vise à éviter l'expulsion vers des endroits où il existe un risque substantiel de torture, l'agent devait tenir compte à la fois des éléments de preuve concernant le demandeur et des éléments de preuve relatifs à la situation dans le pays qui feraient la démonstration de l'existence d'un risque de torture en Inde.
[27]
Le demandeur affirme que l'agent a tiré des conclusions en matière de crédibilité sur la foi d'hypothèses plutôt que d'une analyse rationnelle de la preuve. En effet, les éléments de preuve relatifs à la détention et aux tortures dont il a été victime auraient dû être analysés dans le contexte de la preuve sur la situation dans le pays qui démontrait l'existence d'une impunité des forces policières et d'un terrorisme d'État contre les Sikhs soupçonnés d'être des activistes. Le demandeur fait valoir que l'agent devait tenir compte de la preuve par affidavit étant donné que la torture se déroule rarement en public et qu'un affidavit n'est pas nécessairement dépourvu de toute valeur probante uniquement parce que son souscripteur est une partie intéressée.
[28]
Le demandeur soutient que, dans le contexte d'une expulsion, les décisions administratives de décideurs possédant une indépendance ou une expertise limitées sont incompatibles avec les articles 7 et 12 de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
, partie I de la
Loi constitutionnelle de 1982
, annexe B de la
Loi de 1982 sur le Canada
(R-U), 1982, c 11 [la Charte] et les obligations internationales du Canada en matière de droits de la personne. Le demandeur affirme aussi que le fait de limiter les éléments de preuve qui peuvent être abordés dans le contexte d'un ERAR aux seuls éléments de preuve nouveaux au sens de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR est aussi incompatible avec la Charte.
[29]
Enfin, le demandeur soutient qu'il existe une crainte raisonnable de partialité étant donné que les décideurs chargés des ERAR sont systématiquement favorables à l'expulsion.
[30]
Le défendeur réplique que la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle les éléments de preuve déposés par le demandeur ne constituaient pas des éléments de preuve nouveaux au sens de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR était raisonnable, et ce, parce que les risques allégués par le demandeur étaient essentiellement les mêmes que ceux que la SPR avait rejetés.
[31]
Selon le défendeur, l'analyse qu'a effectuée l'agent de la preuve sur la situation dans le pays était raisonnable étant donné que le demandeur n'a pas démontré qu'il était un activiste sikh bien connu ou que les demandeurs d'asile déboutés courent des risques en Inde. De plus, le défendeur ajoute qu'une demande ne peut être fondée uniquement sur des éléments de preuve relatifs à la situation dans le pays sans qu'un lien soit établi entre la situation personnelle du demandeur et lesdits éléments de preuve.
[32]
Le demandeur soutient que la Cour suprême du Canada a statué que le régime d'ERAR ne contrevient pas aux dispositions des articles 7 et 12 de la Charte ou des obligations juridiques internationales du Canada dans les arrêts suivants:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[33]
Enfin, le défendeur fait valoir que le processus d'ERAR lui-même ne justifie pas une crainte raisonnable de partialité, institutionnelle ou individuelle.
VIII.
Analyse
Norme de contrôle
[34]
Le refus de l'agent d'accepter les affidavits Mohalla, Kaur et Lal comme nouveaux éléments de preuve au sens de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR doit faire l'objet d'un contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 291). L'analyse des nouveaux éléments de preuve est aussi susceptible de contrôle selon la même norme (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[35]
Dans les cas où la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique, la Cour ne peut intervenir que si les motifs ne sont pas justifiés, transparents ou intelligibles. Pour qu'il soit satisfait à cette norme, les décisions doivent aussi appartenir « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47).
[36]
La crainte raisonnable de partialité est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte
( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 281).
[37]
Étant donné que l'article 57 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
empêche les tribunaux de se prononcer sur des questions d'ordre constitutionnel lorsque les avis prévus n'ont pas été transmis, il n'est pas nécessaire d'établir la norme de contrôle qui s'appliquerait aux points visés par les observations relatives à la Charte. Le défaut d'envoyer lesdits avis « est fatal puisqu'il s'agit d'une condition
sine qua non
à l'examen de l'argument constitutionnel soulevé par le demandeur » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53).
(1)
Est-ce que le refus de l'agent d'admettre les éléments de preuve présentés au titre de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR était raisonnable
?
[38]
La conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle les affidavits Mohalla, Kaur et Lal ne constituaient pas de nouveaux éléments de preuve au sens de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR était raisonnable.
[39]
La Cour d'appel fédérale a énoncé le critère qui doit s'appliquer aux nouveaux éléments de preuve au sens de l'alinéa 113
a
) dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[13] Selon [m]on interprétation de l'alinéa 113
a
), cet alinéa repose sur l'idée que l'agent d'ERAR doit prendre acte de la décision de la SPR de rejeter la demande d'asile, à moins que des preuves nouvelles soient survenues depuis le rejet, qui auraient pu conduire la SPR à statuer autrement si elle en avait eu connaissance. L'alinéa 113
a
) pose plusieurs questions, certaines explicitement et d'autres implicitement, concernant les preuves nouvelles en question. Je les résume ainsi:
1.
Crédibilité
: Les preuves nouvelles sont-elles crédibles, compte tenu de leur source et des circonstances dans lesquelles elles sont apparues? Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
2.
Pertinence
: Les preuves nouvelles intéressent-elles la demande d'ERAR, c'est-à-dire sont-elles aptes à prouver ou à réfuter un fait qui intéresse la demande d'asile? Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
3.
Nouveauté
: Les preuves sont-elles nouvelles, c'est-à-dire sont-elles aptes:
a) à prouver la situation ayant cours dans le pays de renvoi, ou un événement ou fait postérieur à l'audition de la demande d'asile?
b) à établir un fait qui n'était pas connu du demandeur d'asile au moment de l'audition de sa demande d'asile?
c) à réfuter une conclusion de fait tirée par la SPR (y compris une conclusion touchant la crédibilité)?
Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
4.
Caractère substantiel
: Les preuves nouvelles sont-elles substantielles, c'est-à-dire la demande d'asile aurait-elle probablement été accordée si elles avaient été portées à la connaissance de la SPR? Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
5.
Conditions légales explicites
:
a) Si les preuves nouvelles sont aptes à établir uniquement un fait qui s'est produit ou des circonstances qui ont existé avant l'audition de la demande d'asile, alors le demandeur a-t-il établi que les preuves nouvelles ne lui étaient pas normalement accessibles lors de l'audition de la demande d'asile, ou qu'il ne serait pas raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentées lors de l'audition de la demande d'asile? Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
b) Si les preuves nouvelles sont aptes à établir un fait qui s'est produit ou les circonstances qui ont existé après l'audition de la demande d'asile, alors elles doivent être considérées (sauf si elles sont rejetées parce qu'elles ne sont pas crédibles, pas pertinentes, pas nouvelles ou pas substantielles).
[40]
Il serait raisonnable de conclure que les affidavits Mohalla et Kaur ne satisfont pas au cinquième critère de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité. En effet, ces affidavits font la preuve d'événements qui sont survenus avant l'audience de la SPR. Le demandeur n'a pas démontré que ces éléments de preuve ne lui étaient pas normalement accessibles ou qu'il n'aurait pas été raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentés au moment de l'audience.
[41]
Même si l'affidavit Lal satisfait au critère de la nouveauté parce qu'il traite du retour du frère du demandeur et de son assassinat ultérieur par la police indienne, il est possible de conclure de façon raisonnable qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une preuve nouvelle selon le critère du caractère substantiel.
[42]
Même si l'agent a déclaré que l'affidavit Lal contenait de nouveaux éléments de preuve au sens de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR, il a refusé de lui accorder une valeur probante parce qu'il reprenait [traduction] « des faits et des événements qui constituaient le fondement de la demande d'asile du demandeur » et que les ajouts relatifs au retour et au meurtre allégués de son frère étaient [traduction] « directement liés à une version jugée non crédible par la SPR » (dossier certifié du tribunal, p. 9). Il est permis de penser que l'agent s'est mal exprimé et qu'il n'a pas considéré l'affidavit de Lal comme un nouvel élément de preuve.
[43]
Il a été établi dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, qu'un agent d'ERAR « peut validement rejeter [des] preuves si elles n'établissent pas que les faits pertinents tels qu'ils se présentent à la date de la demande d'ERAR sont sensiblement différents des faits constatés par la SPR » (au paragraphe 17). Il n'existe aucune différence importante entre, d'une part, les allégations du demandeur faites à l'audience devant la SPR, selon lesquelles lui-même et son frère avaient été détenus et torturés parce que son frère était soupçonné d'être un activiste sikh, et, d'autre part, les allégations de l'affidavit Lal selon lesquelles son frère avait été assassiné parce qu'il était soupçonné d'être un activiste sikh. Étant donné que la SPR n'avait pas cru la version des faits donnée par le demandeur, sa demande n'aurait « probablement [pas] été accordée » si la SPR avait eu accès à l'affidavit Lal (au paragraphe 13).
(2)
Est-ce que l'évaluation par l'agent des éléments de preuve qu'il a acceptés comme nouveaux éléments de preuve au sens de l'alinéa
a
) de la LIPR était raisonnable
?
[44]
L'évaluation qu'a effectuée l'agent d'ERAR des nouveaux éléments de preuve acceptés en vertu de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR était raisonnable. En effet, le certificat de décès et l'avis ne mentionnaient pas la cause de la mort du frère du demandeur et ne permettent pas nécessairement d'inférer qu'il avait été assassiné par la police indienne. En effet, des éléments de preuve sur la situation générale dans un pays ne peuvent remplacer un lien direct avec un demandeur aux fins d'établir l'existence d'un risque personnel auquel serait exposée une personne soupçonnée d'être un activiste sikh en Inde (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
(3)
Est-ce que la procédure d'ERAR en cause donne lieu à une crainte raisonnable de partialité
?
[45]
L'allégation selon laquelle la crainte raisonnable de partialité institutionnelle découle du processus d'ERAR lui-même parce que les agents d'ERAR auraient un préjugé favorable à l'expulsion de demandeurs ne peut être accueillie. En effet, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Edmond Blanchard a rejeté ce même argument (au paragraphe 39).
IX.
Conclusion
[46]
Pour tous les motifs exposés ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur est rejetée.
JUGEMENT
[47]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par le demandeur est rejetée. Aucune question grave de portée générale n'est proposée aux fins de certification.
