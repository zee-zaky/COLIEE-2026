Joyal, J.
: This is an application pursuant to s. 57(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
(
Act
) for an order expunging the registered entry, made under the Trademarks Registrar pursuant to the
Act
, of the "moccasin stitch" or "cross stitch" design as the trademark of the respondent for use in association with wares consisting of denim clothing.
Background
[2]
The respondent Manager Clothing Inc. (Manager), manufacturer as well as seller of jeans and other clothing, is the registered owner of Canadian trademark registration no. 401,742 which consists of the moccasin stitch design, a series of ten "x's" in a straight line, for use in association with denim clothing, namely jeans, pants, shorts, jackets, shirts and skirts.
[3]
The Registrar approved the application for the said trademark on August 21, 1992 on the basis that the design had been used in Canada by the respondent since as early as September 3, 1990 in association with jeans and on the basis of proposed use with respect to other denim clothing.
[4]
I note that since then, the respondent has instituted legal proceedings before the Superior Court of Quebec in order to obtain an injunction to prevent the applicant, a corporation also in the business of selling jeans, from using the said stitching on its jeans. This proceeding should take place in early December of 1993.
[5]
Meanwhile, the applicant filed this application for expungement before this court, on January 26, 1993.
Case For The Applicant
[6]
In the pleadings and during trial, the applicant claimed that the respondent was not entitled to register the trademark since the date on which the respondent allegedly first used the trademark, on September 3, 1990, it had been previously used and made known in Canada by other individuals. It was a stitch available to all traders in the clothing industry, including the applicant. The stitch was of common use.
[7]
The applicant further argued that the registered design is not "distinctive" of the respondent in that it does not distinguish its wares from those of the applicant and other manufacturers or users of the stitch. Not only has this stitch been used for many years, but the applicant submitted that the purpose of the stitch is to decorate the clothing. The applicant therefore alleged that the design is invalid as it serves a decorative function and as such is unregistrable.
[8]
The applicant also claimed that the respondent knew that the moccasin stitch was in the public domain as being one of many popular types of stitching previously used in Canada. The respondent was aware that the design was created and used by all vendors and users in Canada of "La Mocassino" sewing machines. Due to these misrepresentations, the applicant alleged that in September of 1990, the respondent acted in bad faith in its application for the registration of the stitch. As a result of these arguments, the applicant pleaded that the registration No. 401,742 be struck from the register of trademarks.
Case For The Respondent
[9]
The respondent argued that the applicant did not meet the required standard of proof for invalidating the trademark. The respondent claimed that on or about September 3, 1990, it commenced use of the trademark shown in the registration by making samples of clothing bearing the trademark in a nonfunctional way for the purpose of soliciting orders. It subsequently did solicit orders by showing and giving samples to buyers. As early as October and from that month on, the respondent received many purchase orders for denim garments bearing the trademark.
[10]
The respondent claimed that its trademark was and still is "distinctive" within the definition of the
Act
. It argued that the stitch is used as a trademark to distinguish the respondent's wares from the wares of others or is at least "adapted" so as to distinguish them. It argued that the trademark is not used as a method of stitching nor as a decoration but that it is used in a nonfunctional way as a trademark to distinguish wares manufactured and sold by the respondent from wares manufactured, sold or distributed by others.
Findings
[11]
I will initially acknowledge that the applicant is a person interested pursuant to s. 57 of the
Act
. One can safely say that the applicant, a corporation doing similar business as the respondent, "is affected or reasonably apprehends that he may be affected by any entry in the register ..." pursuant to the definition of a "person interested" under s. 2 of the
Act
. I do not want to go further in this analysis as it was not an issue which was greatly debated before me. There is no doubt that the applicant has a reasonable apprehension that it will suffer a prejudice if the trademark is not removed from the register.
[12]
The second issue to consider is the validity of the respondent's registered trademark. The onus to prove such invalidity is on the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Cullen, J., stated that:
"registration of a trademark confers certain rights and benefits to the owner, including prima facie proof of these rights and ownership of the trademark. Thus, when a trademark is registered there is a presumption of validity and therefore the party seeking the expungement of the trademark has the onus of proving its invalidity." (at p. 255)
[13]
The applicant set itself to prove that the said stitch belongs to the public domain, that it was not or is not distinctive from any other goods bearing the same stitch, and that it served and still serves a functional purpose in that it is decorative. The burden on the applicant is heavy:
"a decision from such an expert official as the Registrar of Trademarks ought not to be disturbed lightly. The onus on the appellant is heavy. He must show that the decision of the Registrar is so wrong as to warrant interference by this court." (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 270 (F.C.T.D.) by Dubé, J.)
(A) Nondistinctiveness (Public Domain)
[14]
The applicant claimed that the stitch had been used in Canada prior to the claim made by the respondent and that it was therefore not distinct from the stitch used by other Canadians. Pursuant to s. 57(1) of the
Act
, the applicant claimed that the mark was not distinctive at the time the application was entered and that it has continued to be in the public domain up to the time the hearing was held.
[15]
"Distinctive" is defined in s. 2 of the
Act
:
"'distinctive', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted so to distinguish them"
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), Cattanach, J., of this court (as he then was) stated that this definition
"envisages two circumstances, the first being where a trademark is, prima facie, not distinctive as is the case of a word clearly descriptive of the character or quality of the wares in association with which it is used in which event it becomes a question of fact if the trademark actually distinguishes the wares. The second circumstance envisaged by the definition of 'distinctive' arises from the concluding words therein, 'or is adapted so as to distinguish them'. Obviously these words were introduced to cover the circumstances of a proposed trademark or a mark that has not enjoyed a long and extensive use. The second circumstance contemplates the case where it cannot be established as a question of fact that a descriptive trademark has acquired a secondary meaning. Accordingly I am of the opinion that in the case of a proposed trademark or one that has enjoyed limited use the trademark must be inherently distinctive to be registered." (p. 18)
[16]
The trademark before me falls within the first category. The stitch is, prima facie, not distinctive. It therefore becomes a question of fact as to whether the trademark distinguishes the wares.
[17]
It is also important, in evaluating the distinctiveness of the trademark, that "the overall impression upon the members of the public to whom the wares are offered for sale ... be assessed" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 209 (T.D.) by MacKay, J.). In this case, I have to consider if members of the public associate the stitch on denim clothing with Manager's ware.
[18]
I took judicial notice during the hearing, for the current case before me, that a cross stitch used as a stitching method or as a decoration is in the public domain. The affidavit and testimony of Mme. Annick Vaudelle proved that. The stitch has been used for sewing garments, embroidery, folk costumes, etc. But as the cross stitch is part of the public domain, so is a circle, a square, a line, etc. The distinctiveness in this case is measured by the capacity of the trademark to distinguish the wares of the respondent from any other manufacturer's similar wares. Does a series of ten cross stitches distinguish the denim clothing manufactured by Manager from denim clothing manufactured by others?
[19]
The use of the stitch, not as a stitching method nor as a simple decoration, but as a distinguishing trademark is novel and distinct of any previous use of the said stitch. The respondent claimed that its use of the stitch is such as to distinguish its denim clothing from the other manufacturers' similar wares. I agree that such use of the stitch makes it registrable under the
Act
.
[20]
Although the respondent is entitled to the trademark, the use of the said stitch as a distinguishing feature will give no right to the respondent to prevent others from using the stitch's utilitarian features such as for decoration and stitching. (
Trademarks and Industrial Designs
, Goldsmith, pp. 107-108) The respondent's trademark is considered a "weaker mark":
"It is well established that a trademark consisting of a striking inventive name or an original design is inherently distinctive and is considered a strong mark. As such, it is entitled to a wide scope of protection. This is especially so if it has become well-known through usage. On the other hand, if a mark lacks these exceptional qualities in design or wording, it is inherently less distinctive and is considered a weaker mark. The ambit of protection afforded to a weak mark is much less than for a strong mark, and registration of other marks containing comparatively small differences may be permitted. ... It is the reaction to the totality of this design which determines the distinctiveness. The law conforms to this obvious fact by providing that a trademark must be looked at as a whole, as Thorson, P., stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 136 ...
'Trademarks may be different from another and, therefore not confusing with another when looked at in their totality, even if there are similarities in some of the elements when viewed separately. It is the combination of the elements that constitutes the trademark and it is the effect of the trademark as a whole; rather than that of any particular part in it, that must be considered.'" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.), at p. 182)
(B) The Functional Or Ornamental
Purpose Of The Trademark
[21]
The applicant's alternative argument for expungement is that the registered stitch, although it may be distinctive, serves a decorative purpose. For the reasons mentioned above, I do not believe that the use of the stitch, in this case, is functional nor decorative in nature. I will, however, briefly elaborate the law on this issue. The Supreme Court of Canada stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. 1, at p. 6:
"The law appears to be well settled that if what is sought to be registered as a trademark has a functional use or characteristic, it cannot be the subject of a trademark."
[22]
On the same subject, the Trademarks Opposition Board stated that
"[i]n determining whether a mark can function as a 'trademark', consideration must be given as to whether the mark is ornamental or is, to a certain degree, functional in nature. If a mark is strictly functional or has a characteristic appearance resulting from the process of its manufacture, it is not a trademark. Likewise, ornamentation applied to wares for purposes of enhancing the appearance of the wares is not proper subject matter for a trademark." (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M. Opp. Bd.), at p. 231)
[23]
In this case the respondent's cross stitch did not serve a function as it was not used as a method of stitching nor was it merely decorative. Obviously a cross stitch made of yellow, orange or light blue thread has the effect of decorating the ware but its main purpose was to be used as a means to distinguish the respondent's ware. Contrary to the case in
W.J. Hughes & Sons " <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 34 (Ex. Ct.), the stitch is not used for functional nor ornamentation purposes only. I come to the conclusion that the cross stitch, in this case, is not used as a stitch nor as a decoration although such purposes have been its common use for many years. Rather, the respondent has used the cross stitch as a distinguishing mark on the pockets, or along the outer seam of the legs of its denim ware. The trademark will therefore not be expunged from the register of trademarks.
[24]
This application is therefore dismissed.
Application dismissed.
