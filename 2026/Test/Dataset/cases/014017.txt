I The Facts
[1]
Noël, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for a writ of certiorari to issue against the National Parole Board (NPB) and the Attorney General of Canada to quash a decision made by the Appeal Division of the NPB on April 10, 1996, confirming the decision of the NPB not to grant the applicant parole under a procedure referred to as "accelerated parole review".
[2]
The applicant is incarcerated in the Leclerc correctional institution. He was convicted of possession for the purpose of trafficking in narcotics, possession of property obtained by crime and having an unregistered loaded weapon in his possession. When he was arrested he was in possession of 10 kilograms of cocaine and $250,000 in cash. He was sentenced to serve a term of 10 years' imprisonment beginning on December 15, 1992.
[3]
On December 6, 1995, the applicant appeared before the NPB for the hearing of an application for day parole and for accelerated parole review for the purpose of obtaining full parole. The latter application was subject to ss. 125 and 126 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
. [see footnote 1]
[4]
At the hearing, the NPB had before it the various correctional reports that were attached to the affidavit of Jean-Marc Trudel dated June 10, 1996.
[5]
The first was the criminal profile report concerning the application, which stated that the members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who had arrested him in Winnipeg were of the opinion that the applicant had close ties to the world of organized crime. They based their opinion on the fact that the resale value of the cocaine entrusted to the applicant was very high and that he also had a large sum of money in his possession.
[6]
In the Progress Summary Report (hereinafter referred to as "PSR") dated May 15, 1995, the case management team identified the applicant's affiliation with a criminal biker group, the Evil Ones, and the possession of an unregistered loaded weapon at the time of his arrest as factors relating to public safety.
[7]
The PSR dated September 14, 1995, stated that, according to protected information obtained, the applicant was to have gained full Hell's Angels status when he was released, for services rendered, that he had been identified as acting as the strongarm for one of his fellow Hell's Angels inmates, that he was associated with a biker group that was competing with another biker group in drug trafficking, both inside and outside the walls, and that he had been identified on the preventive security table of the Leclerc institution as a member of the Evil Ones, a group associated with the Hell's Angels.
[8]
It was also pointed out in the PSR of September 14, 1995 that in the past the applicant had been charged with an offence relating to the presence of a weapon in a motor vehicle and then discharged. The correctional report of September 14, 1995 also mentioned that the applicant had admitted at an interview that he had lived off the proceeds of the sale of drugs.
[9]
The PSR of September 14, 1995 also mentioned that the applicant did not seem to be engaging in any real self-examination in terms of his criminal involvement and that he was still continuing to receive visits from two members of the Evil Ones, although it was clearly stated in his correctional plan that he had to cease all contact with biker groups in order to be eligible for any form of release.
[10]
In its analysis of the release plan, the case management team also raised the fact that the applicant's possession of an unregistered restricted weapon at the time of his arrest showed [Translation] "how far he was prepared to go to protect the goods and himself", which also, according to the team, showed a "potential risk of violence".
[11]
The case management team therefore concluded as follows on September 14, 1995: [Translation] "We consider the day parole plan to be premature" since the applicant must first "cut all ties with the bikers who continue to visit him in the institution as he himself admitted to us."
[12]
When the applicant's correctional plan was updated on September 19, 1995, it specified: [Translation] "before any application for any form of release, whether GTAs, ETAs, UTAs or work releases, he must distance himself from people associated with biker groups by burning his bridges with them or by avoiding entering into new relationships with them."
[13]
In a community assessment done on October 16, 1995, for the purpose of day parole, he was refused admission to the Espadrille Community Residential Centre on the grounds, among other things, of his associations with criminal peers.
[14]
On November 6, 1995, in a subsequent PSR relating to changing the applicant's security classification to a higher one, the case management team mentioned that the inmate was demonstrating a cooperative attitude in terms of the objectives of his correctional plan, [Translation] "except in respect of cutting his ties with the criminal biker world as he was supposed to do".
[15]
According to the case management team, not only had the applicant not cut his ties with the criminal bikers, but he had clearly demonstrated his intention to continue his relationship with a fellow inmate, Richard Rousseau, who was known to be a "striker" (enforcer) for the Hell's Angels, and had gone so far as to request a transfer to a new living unit so that he could live in the same room as Mr. Rousseau.
[16]
Lastly, the PSR updating the information for the purpose of the Board's accelerated parole review on November 10, 1995, mentioned that the applicant's criminality was [Translation] "structured and motivated by the desire for profit". According to the assessment done by the case management team, [Translation] "acting out is associated with a very close identification with biker groups and also with highly structured criminal values".
[17]
This is the information that was available at the time of the review by the NPB on December 6, 1995. At the conclusion of the hearing, the NPB decided not to grant the applicant's application for day parole, and also decided not to order full parole because, it said, it was convinced that there were reasonable grounds to believe that if the applicant were released he would commit an offence involving violence before the expiration of his sentence. The Appeal Division of the NPB affirmed the decision on April 11, 1996, and it is of that decision that the appellant is seeking judicial review.
II The Decision A Quo
[18]
In its decision of December 6, the NPB relied on the following grounds to justify its denial of day parole:
[Translation] "... There is no doubt in the Board's mind that your criminality is certainly more serious than what is shown on the FPS record, in that it is clear that in order for you to have enjoyed the trust of the people who gave you such a large quantity of drugs, this was not your first deal. While incarcerated, you earned an offence report for which you were sentenced to 10 days for concealing a sum of money, $108.50, on the pottery workshop premises. The Board can only conclude that an individual who is not prepared to obey the rules of a penitentiary institution is clearly demonstrating that when he is released he will do the same thing in society. For all of the foregoing reasons, we believe that you are still an unacceptable risk for day parole." [see footnote 2]
[19]
The NPB stated the following reasons for denying full parole:
[Translation] "... Having completed this analysis, the Board is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that, if you are released, you are likely to commit an offence involving violence before the expiration of your sentence, and accordingly it does not direct that you be released on full parole, in accordance with s. 126(2) of the
Act
.
"In making this decision, the Commission has taken into consideration the fact that you have been very active in a group of bikers identified as the 'Evil Ones'. Based on official information, this group is affiliated with the 'Hell's Angels', a group that is known to control drug trafficking, prostitution, loan sharking and other criminal activities. The members of these organizations are also known to use violence in all forms to assume control and power over particular geographic areas. We have no reason to believe that you are an exception to the rule. You tell us that you had a loaded weapon in your possession for your protection, if necessary, and we believe that you would not have hesitated to use it if you had been attacked.
"Although you say today that you want to dissociate yourself from this group, this fact can only be verified in the longer term." [see footnote 3]
[20]
The applicant challenged this decision in the Appeal Division on a number of grounds. He argued that there was no evidence or information from which the NPB could conclude that he would commit an offence involving violence in the event that he were released. He also disputed the fact that he was judged by the actions of the Hell's Angels and not by his own actions. In his view, the test applied by the NPB in determining whether he had in fact cut his ties with the biker group made it impossible for him to show that he had, as long as he remained behind bars. Lastly, he contended that he could not be connected with the bikers' current criminal activities since he had been incarcerated for four years.
[21]
In making its decision, the Appeal Division first noted the role it must play: to ensure that the NPB does not violate the provisions of the
Act
and its directives, that it observes the principles of fundamental justice and that its decision is based on sufficient and relevant information. It then concluded that the principles of natural justice had been observed at the hearing, since the applicant had an opportunity to express his concerns to the members and to respond to their concerns. Lastly, it concluded that the decision of the NPB was reasonable based on the evidence before it.
III Applicant's Position In Respect Of The Decision A Quo
[22]
According to the applicant, the Appeal Division erred in law:
(a) by considering, in doing its assessment, the charges for which the appellant had been discharged in the past;
(b) by basing its decision on the personal feelings of its members rather than on the evidence in the record;
(c) by imposing a burden of proof on the applicant the effect of which was to make any possibility of parole unattainable;
(d) by concluding that the NPB had enough evidence from which it could have concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was likely to commit an offence involving violence before the expiration of his sentence according to law.
[23]
In all these arguments, the applicant's essential submission is that the effect of the test applied by the NPB and approved by the Appeal Division had the effect of eliminating any possibility of parole being granted to bikers or former members of biker groups through the accelerated parole review, when the
Act
does not authorize this kind of selective treatment.
IV Decision
(a) Consideration Of The Charges For Which The Applicant Was Discharged
[24]
The applicant contends that the NPB erred by considering a charge for which he was discharged in the past. The charge in question related to the presence of a weapon in a motor vehicle. At the time, the applicant had succeeded in satisfying his accusers that he had picked up a pal in his motor vehicle and that it was that person who was in possession of the weapon. He reiterated that explanation before the NPB. I note that under s. 125(3) of the
Act
, the NPB may have regard to all information that is relevant, including information that tends to disclose a potential for violent behaviour. In my view, the facts relating to the charge for which the applicant was discharged, when considered in conjunction with the information otherwise available, including the circumstances surrounding his arrest, constitute such information. On this first point, the Appeal Division was undoubtedly correct to uphold the conclusions of the NPB. [see footnote 4]
(b) The Board's Knowledge Of Criminal Biker Groups
[25]
According to the applicant, the NPB could not base its decision on its own knowledge of criminal biker groups or on the hearsay reputation that these groups have acquired in relation to their violent behaviour. This argument runs up against both the settled principle that a tribunal like the NPB is entitled to use the expertise and experience acquired by its members in the performance of their duties [see footnote 5] and the duty of the NPB to use all information relevant to the case that is available to it, in making its decision. [see footnote 6] On this point, the Supreme Court stated in
Mooring
, after examining the NPB's primary role [see footnote 7]:
"In the risk assessment function of the Board, the factors which predominate are those which concern the protection of society. The protection of the accused to ensure a fair trial and maintain the repute of the administration of justice which weighs so heavily in the application of s. 24(2) is overborne by the overriding societal interest. In assessing the risk to society, the emphasis is on ensuring that all reliable information is considered provided it has not been obtained improperly.
. . . . .
"Like the basic structure and function of the Parole Board, the language of the Board's enabling statute makes it clear that the Board lacks the ability or jurisdiction to exclude relevant evidence. The language of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
confers on the Board a broad inclusionary mandate. Not only is it not bound to apply the traditional rules of evidence, but it is required to take into account 'all available information that is relevant to a case'. No mention is made of any power to apply exclusionary rules of evidence. Indeed, such a provision would conflict with its duty to consider '
all
available information that is relevant'."
[26]
It follows from this that the NPB was entitled to use all the information that was available to it relating to the behaviour and actions of criminal biker groups, including its own expertise in that respect.
[27]
The Board's conclusion with respect to the ties between those groups and the applicant, and more specifically that the applicant has maintained contacts with members of criminal biker groups while he has been incarcerated, is based on specific evidence. On this point, I note the numerous correctional reports that were before the NPB and that point to an on-going relationship, despite the fact that the applicant had been warned to terminate those relations.
[28]
I therefore conclude that the NPB was entitled, based on the information available to it, to conclude that the applicant had not demonstrated that he had made a definitive break from these groups.
(c) The Burden Of Proof
[29]
The applicant argued that the tests applied by the NPB are so stringent that he cannot hope to be granted any form of release, as a biker or former member of a biker group. In his view, the burden of proof imposed on him precludes any possibility of parole. [see footnote 8]
[30]
More precisely, the applicant argued that the only way he can demonstrate that he is no longer affiliated with these groups is to say so, which he has done. In his view, there is no other means available to him to prove this [see footnote 9]. However, the correctional reports show unequivocally that he has continued to maintain ties with members of criminal biker groups, by associating with a notorious member of those groups inside the walls, and by receiving visits from members on the outside, despite the fact that his rehabilitation plan proposed that he definitively cut his ties with these people. This is also what motivated the NPB to conclude that [Translation] "Even though you are saying today that you want to dissociate yourself from the group, that fact can only be verified in the longer term." [see footnote 10]
[31]
It is therefore wrong to contend that the NPB has placed an insurmountable burden on the applicant. The applicant will still be able to demonstrate, by his behaviour, if such is the case, that he has in fact cut his ties with the criminal biker groups if he decides to do so.
(d) The Risk That The Applicant Will Commit An Offence Involving Violence
[32]
Lastly, the applicant argued that the NPB had no information from which it could have concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that, if released, he might commit an offence involving violence before the expiration of his sentence according to law.
[33]
I cannot agree with this argument. As set out in the preceding pages, the NPB was capable of observing the difficulty the applicant was having in cutting his ties with criminal biker groups. The members of the NPB also had in mind the applicant's criminal history and that fact that after being discharged on a charge of possession of a weapon in April 1988 he was found to be in possession of a loaded weapon when he was arrested. He also had a large quantity of narcotics and cash under his control, and the weapon he had in his possession was intended to be used to protect them. According to the members of the NPB, the applicant would not have hesitated to use his weapon if the circumstances had made it necessary.
[34]
In my view, the applicant's obvious loyalty to his criminal colleagues, [see footnote 11] together with the ties he has maintained with them while he has been incarcerated and the notorious violence that characterizes their actions, comprised certain and convincing information based on which the NPB was entitled to conclude as it did.
[35]
For these reasons, it has not been demonstrated that the Appeal Division erred in law by affirming the decision of the NPB. The application for judicial review is therefore dismissed.
Application dismissed.
