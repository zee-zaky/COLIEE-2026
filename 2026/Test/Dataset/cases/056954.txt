[1]
Mosley, J.
: These reasons address two applications for judicial review arising from decisions of a Senior Immigration Officer which refused the applicant's request for an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) grounds from the in-Canada selection criteria for permanent residence and found that he would not be at risk of persecution or harm on return to his country of origin in a pre-removal risk assessment ("PRRA").
[2]
For the reasons that follow, both applications are dismissed.
BACKGROUND
:
[3]
The applicant is 39 years old and a citizen of Ethiopia. He entered Canada in October 2004 on a visitor's visa to compete in a marathon and claimed protection shortly thereafter. His wife and son continue to live in Ethiopia.
[4]
The applicant alleged in his claim that he was at risk of persecution in Ethiopia because he was a member of the All Ethiopia United Party (AEUP) which was in opposition to the government. In August 2005, the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board (the "RPD") denied the claim on credibility grounds. The RPD concluded that the applicant had not shown that he had suffered serious harm in Ethiopia or would face a risk of harm if returned.
[5]
An application for leave and judicial review of the RPD decision was denied in December 2005. An application for reconsideration of the RPD decision was ultimately denied after being held in abeyance pending the release of decisions from the Federal Court of Appeal relating to the hearing procedure followed by the RPD.
[6]
In December 2005, the applicant applied for an exemption from the in-Canada selection criteria and for permanent residence under s.25(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,
SC, 2001, c 27 ("the Act"). Over the six years this application was in process, the applicant provided extensive submissions in support of his application. He drew attention to his establishment in Canada and the alleged risk he faced as a returning deportee to Ethiopia. He submitted that the Ethiopian government would perceive him as an opposition member because of his claim for protection from Canada against Ethiopia. The application was denied on September 20, 2011.
[7]
The applicant applied for a PRRA on October 19, 2010. In support of that application, he drew attention to an increase in persecution of opposition members by the Ethiopian government following the 2005 election in that country asserting that this was a new risk which had not been before the RPD when it heard his claim. He also said that the Ethiopian police were still actively seeking him, pointing to e-mails from his wife who said that the police had come to her home on several occasions, beat her and threatened to kill her if she did not tell them where the applicant was. A negative risk assessment was issued on September 14, 2011.
ISSUES
:
[8]
The following issues are raised in this case:
1. Whether the officer breached the applicant's right to procedural fairness by not calling him for an interview;
2.Whether the officer applied the wrong test for H&C relief;
3. Whether the officer's treatment of the evidence before her was unreasonable;
4. Whether the officer failed to consider a ground of risk the applicant advanced to support his PRRA.
ANALYSIS
:
Standard of Review
[9]
Where an issue of procedural fairness arises, the Court must determine whether the process followed by the decision-maker satisfied the level of fairness required in all of the circumstances:
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The officer's alleged failure to consider the applicant's claim as it was advanced is also subject to the reasonableness standard:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Was there a breach of procedural fairness?
[11]
The applicant submits that in both the PRRA and H&C decisions, the officer relied on the assessment of the applicant's credibility by the RPD. In neither application did the officer give the applicant an opportunity to address credibility concerns in an oral interview. The applicant contends that this was a breach of procedural fairness.
[12]
As discussed in
Baker
, above, at paragraphs 33 and 34, an oral hearing is not required in an H&C application. The officer was required to provide the applicant with an opportunity to make submissions, which she did. The H&C decision was based, not on credibility, but on the lack of objective evidence to demonstrate the hardship which the applicant alleged.
[13]
With respect to the PRRA application, s.113(b) provides that a hearing may be held if required on the basis of prescribed factors. The prescribed factors, set out in section 167 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227, require that there be evidence that raises a serious credibility issue in relation to the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act, that this evidence be central to the decision and, if accepted, that it would justify allowing the application for protection.
[14]
Here the officer evaluated the new evidence presented by the applicant. She declined to consider evidence which was available or could reasonably have been made available before the RPD decision. This was consistent with the principles set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The evidence that did meet the standards of newness, relevance and materiality was considered by the officer.
[15]
The new evidence did not raise serious credibility issues as it was, for the most part, documentary evidence relating to the conditions in Ethiopia. The only evidence about which credibility could have been a factor were three e-mails from the applicant's wife indicating that the police continue to look for him. The officer made no credibility finding with respect to this evidence, determining rather to give it little weight due to its vagueness. That evidence was not central to the decision and would not have justified allowing the PRRA application.
[16]
In my view, credibility was not a live issue in either application and consequently there was no breach of procedural fairness.
Did the officer apply the wrong test for humanitarian and compassionate relief?
[17]
The same Senior Immigration Officer considered both applications. The applicant submits that the officer, having first dealt with the PRRA application, merely substituted "hardship" for "risk" when she came to consider the H&C application. In other words, she applied the higher thresholds for risk under sections 96 and 97 of the Act and did not adequately consider that a level of risk which did not meet those standards could yet constitute unusual, disproportionate and undeserved hardship warranting a H&C exemption.
[18]
In my view, the decision clearly shows that the officer evaluated the H&C application on the correct hardship test. Among other references to the correct test interspersed in her reasons, at the outset she stated:
I am cognizant in this application that while the harm he has cited may not rise to a level of s. 96 and/or s. 97 of the [Act], it may contribute to a finding of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship
[19]
The applicant had stressed risk in Ethiopia as a ground of hardship in his H&C submissions. It was reasonable for the officer to analyze whether the risk which would show hardship actually existed and her reasoning on this point does not show that she applied the wrong test. The applicant had raised essentially the same grounds of risk in both the H&C and the PRRA applications and it is not unreasonable to find that the language used to evaluate those risks will necessarily be similar. Aside from that similarity, there is no evidence that the officer applied an incorrect test for the H&C application.
Was the officer's treatment of the evidence before her unreasonable?
[20]
Under paragraph 113(a) of the Act;
a. an applicant whose claim to refugee protection has been rejected may present only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection;
[21]
The question before the officer, then, was whether the applicant had demonstrated he faced a forward-looking risk in Ethiopia on the basis of evidence which was not before the RPD. The applicant asserted the same risks in his PRRA Application as he had before the RPD. Although the applicant submitted several country documents which showed opposition members are at an increased risk in Ethiopia, he did not provide any evidence beyond his bare assertion that he was an opposition member, a claim which the RPD had disbelieved. This is what the officer was referring to when she said that:
I note that the [applicant] is not named in the documents and he has not indicated how they relate to a personalized, forward looking risk for him in Ethiopia.
[22]
Given the onus on the applicant to show, based on new evidence, that he faced a risk because of his party membership, it was reasonable for the officer to look at the documents to see if he was named in them as an opposition member. It was also reasonable for the officer to find that, in the absence of evidence showing the applicant was actually an opposition member, any risk established by the country documents was a generalized one. The officer's conclusion the applicant had not established the risk asserted in the PRRA application was reasonable.
[23]
The officer considered the letters from the psychiatrist. They indicate that the applicant's psychiatric condition did not begin until after the RPD decision. It was not unreasonable to conclude that this stemmed from the failure of his claim and not from the conditions he had experienced in Ethiopia before his journey to Canada. The letters indicate that medicine was prescribed to address the condition but do not contain information regarding the availability of the medication in Ethiopia. The officer reasonably gave a low probative value to this evidence with respect to the PRRA application and the determination of hardship.
[24]
The officer also reasonably dealt with the other aspects of the H&C decision. It is not enough for the applicant to say that the officer could have concluded that the evidence he submitted showed establishment in Canada that would lead to hardship if he was removed. The officer reviewed all the relevant evidence and came to a conclusion that was open to her. The Court may intervene only if the decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law": <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 59. That was not the case here.
Did the officer fail to consider a ground of risk the applicant advanced to support his PRRA
?
[25]
The applicant also argues that the officer did not consider whether he faced a risk simply because he was a returning failed refugee claimant. As the respondent points out, the applicant did not raise this ground of risk in his submissions on the PRRA application but rather in his H&C application. Although considered by the same officer, these were separate applications. Had they been processed separately by different officers, the applicant would not have the benefit of the grounds he raised in his H&C application being before the officer considering his PRRA.
[26]
To hold it was a reviewable error for the officer not to consider grounds raised in a separate application would be to grant greater protection to claimants whose applications are processed together than those whose applications are processed separately. A reviewable error should not arise simply out of peculiarities in scheduling. In any event, the officer acknowledged the alleged risk factor in his PRRA decision.
[27]
The evidence offered in support of this ground relates primarily to the large number of returnees expelled from the adjacent countries in Africa and to renditions of persons from other more developed nations, presumably for inadmissibility reasons. It does not establish that the applicant is similarly situated to those persons and would face risk merely by reason of returning following a failed refugee claim abroad. Similarly, the evidence does not demonstrate that he would be at risk by reason of his profile as a returned international calibre athlete. In the absence of evidence, this is no more than an argument that the officer failed to speculate as to what might occur.
[28]
The evidence does establish that the level of oppression towards opposition members increased following the 2005 elections which returned a larger number of them to the legislative assembly. But, as the RPD found, the applicant did not have the profile of an opposition activist before he left Ethiopia and it did not believe that he was a member of an opposition party. The officer did not need to revisit those findings.
[29]
I understand that the applicant has the support of many in the community who believe that he has and could continue to make a valuable contribution to Canadian society. He has for example helped to train and mentor youth in the running sports. To make a living, he has set up a small business and employs others. This is evidence of his determination to make a home in Canada. But the question before me is not whether it is fair for Mr. Eshete to stay in Canada but whether the officer's decisions fall outside the acceptable range of outcomes defensible on the facts and the law. I am unable to reach that conclusion.
[30]
No serious questions of general importance were proposed and none will be certified.

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  présents motifs portent sur deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire découlant de décisions rendues par une agente principale d'immigration qui a refusé la demande du demandeur que soient levés, pour des circonstances d'ordre humanitaires (CH), les critères de sélection pour l'obtention de la résidence permanente depuis le Canada, et qui a conclu dans le cadre d'un examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR) que celui-ci ne serait pas exposé au risque d'être persécuté ou de subir un préjudice s'il devait retourner dans son pays d'origine.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, les deux demandes sont rejetées.
CONTEXTE
[3]
Le demandeur est un citoyen de l'Éthiopie âgé de 39 ans. Il est arrivé au Canada en octobre 2004 grâce à un visa de visiteur en vue de participer à un marathon. Peu de temps après, il a demandé l'asile. Sa conjointe et son fils vivent toujours en Éthiopie.
[4]
Le demandeur a allégué dans sa demande d'asile qu'il était exposé à un risque de persécution en Éthiopie parce qu'il était membre du All Ethiopian Unity Party (AEUP) qui s'opposait au gouvernement. En août 2005, la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (SPR) a refusé sa demande pour des motifs de crédibilité. La SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré qu'il avait subi un préjudice grave en Éthiopie ou y serait exposé s'il retournait dans son pays.
[5]
Une demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire a été rejetée en décembre 2005. Une demande de réexamen de la décision de la SPR a été en fin de compte rejetée après avoir été mise en suspens jusqu'à la publication des arrêts de la Cour d'appel fédérale relativement à la procédure d'audience suivie par la SPR.
[6]
En décembre 2005, le demandeur a demandé que soient levés les critères de sélection pour l'obtention de la résidence permanente depuis le Canada au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, ch. 27 (la Loi). Au fil des six années de traitement de sa demande, le demandeur a fourni d'amples observations pour appuyer celle-ci. Il a fait valoir son établissement au Canada et le risque auquel il s'exposerait comme expulsé de retour en Éthiopie. Il a fait valoir que le gouvernement éthiopien le considèrerait comme un opposant vu sa demande d'asile au Canada aux fins de protection contre l'Éthiopie. La demande a été rejetée le 20 septembre 2011.
[7]
Le demandeur a présenté une demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR) le 19 octobre 2010. À l'appui de cette demande, il a souligné l'aggravation de la persécution des membres de l'opposition par le gouvernement éthiopien par suite de l'élection de 2005 dans ce pays, affirmant qu'il s'agissait d'un nouveau risque, lequel n'existait pas au moment où la SPR a instruit sa demande. En outre, il a indiqué que la police éthiopienne était toujours activement à sa recherche, en attirant l'attention sur les courriels de sa conjointe disant que la police était venue chez elle à plusieurs reprises, l'avait battue et menacée de mort si elle ne leur révélait pas où il se trouvait. Une évaluation des risques défavorable a été faite le 14 septembre 2011.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[8]
Les questions soulevées en l'espèce sont les suivantes
:
1. L'agente a-t-elle porté atteinte au droit du demandeur à l'équité procédurale en ne le convoquant pas à une entrevue?
2. L'agente a-t-elle appliqué le mauvais critère relativement à la dispense pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire?
3. Le traitement par l'agente de la preuve au dossier était-il déraisonnable?
4. L'agente a-t-elle omis de prendre en considération un motif de risque invoqué par le demandeur à l'appui de sa demande d'ERAR?
ANALYSE
La norme de contrôle
[9]
Lorsque pose une question d'équité procédurale, le devoir de la Cour est de déterminer si le processus suivi par le décideur répond au degré d'équité requis dans les circonstances: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 43.
[10]
La norme de contrôle applicable à la question de savoir si une agente a appliqué le bon critère aux fins d'appréciation des motifs d'ordre humanitaire est la norme de la décision correcte:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . L'omission alléguée de l'agente de prendre en considération la demande du demandeur telle qu'elle a été présentée est également susceptible de contrôle suivant la norme du caractère raisonnable:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Y a-t-il eu manquement à l'équité procédurale?
[11]
Le demandeur soutient qu'en ce qui a trait à la décision d'ERAR et à la décision relative aux motifs d'ordre humanitaire (CH), l'agente s'est fondée sur l'évaluation de la crédibilité du demandeur effectuée par la SPR. Dans ni l'une ni l'autre des demandes, l'agente n'a offert au demandeur la possibilité de lever les incertitudes quant à la crédibilité dans le cadre d'une entrevue personnelle. Le demandeur estime que cela a constitué un manquement à l'équité procédurale.
[12]
Ainsi que l'écrivait la Cour suprême dans l'arrêt
Baker
, précité, aux paragraphes 33 et 34, la tenue d'une audience n'est pas exigée dans le cadre d'une demande CH. L'agente devait fournir au demandeur la possibilité de formuler des observations, ce qu'elle a fait. La décision relative à la demande CH était fondée, non sur la crédibilité, mais sur l'absence de preuves objectives témoignant des difficultés alléguées par le demandeur.
[13]
En ce qui touche la demande d'ERAR, l'alinéa 113
b
) prévoit qu'une audience peut être tenue si le ministre l'estime requis compte tenu des facteurs réglementaires. Les facteurs réglementaires, énoncés à l'article 167 du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227, requièrent l'existence d'éléments de preuve, relatifs aux éléments mentionnés aux articles 96 et 97 de la Loi, qui soulèvent une question importante en ce qui concerne la crédibilité, que ces éléments de preuve soient importants pour la prise de décision et, à supposer que ces éléments soient admis, qu'ils justifient que soit accordée la protection.
[14]
En l'espèce, l'agente a évalué les nouveaux éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur. Elle a refusé de prendre en considération les éléments de preuve qui étaient accessibles ou qui auraient pu être normalement accessibles avant la décision de la SPR. Cela était conforme aux principes énoncés par Cour d'appel fédérale dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Les éléments de preuve qui satisfaisaient effectivement aux normes de nouveauté, d'importance et de pertinence ont été pris en considération par l'agente.
[15]
Les nouveaux éléments de preuve n'ont pas soulevé de questions graves de crédibilité étant donné qu'il s'agissait, pour la plupart, des preuves documentaires en lien avec la situation en Éthiopie. Les seuls éléments de preuve à propos desquels la crédibilité aurait pu constituer un facteur étaient trois courriels de la conjointe du demandeur disant que la police est toujours à sa recherche. L'agente n'a tiré aucune conclusion sur la crédibilité en ce qui a trait à cet élément de preuve, choisissant plutôt de lui accorder peu de poids vu son imprécision. Cet élément de preuve n'était pas important pour la prise de décision et n'aurait pas justifié que soit accordée la demande d'ERAR.
[16]
À mon avis, la crédibilité n'était pas une question réelle pour l'une ou l'autre des demandes et, de ce fait, il n'y a eu aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale.
L'agente a-t-elle appliqué le mauvais critère relativement à la dispense pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire?
[17]
C'est la même agente principale d'immigration qui a pris en considération les deux demandes. Le demandeur fait valoir que l'agente, après avoir examiné la demande d'ERAR, s'est bornée à substituer le mot « difficultés » au mot « risques »lorsqu'elle a examiné la demande CH. En d'autres termes, elle a appliqué les critères de risque les plus rigoureux en vertu des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi et n'a pas suffisamment tenu compte du fait qu'un niveau de risque ne répondant pas à ces normes peut toutefois représenter des difficultés inhabituelles, disproportionnées et injustifiées justifiant une dispense pour des considérations humanitaires.
[18]
À mon avis, la décision démontre clairement que l'agente a évalué la demande CH en fonction du critère approprié, à savoir le critère des difficultés. Parmi d'autres références au critère approprié dans ses motifs, elle a déclaré au début:
[traduction] Je suis consciente que dans le cadre de la présente demande, bien que le préjudice invoqué puisse ne pas atteindre le niveau exigé aux articles 96 ou 97 de la [Loi], il peut mener à conclure à des difficultés inhabituelles, disproportionnées et injustifiées.
[19]
Dans ses observations sur les motifs CH, le demandeur a souligné que les risques auxquels il serait exposé en Éthiopie constituaient un motif de difficultés. Il était raisonnable pour l'agente de vérifier si le risque qui entraînerait ces difficultés existait réellement, et son raisonnement à cet égard n'indique pas qu'elle a appliqué le mauvais critère. Le demandeur avait soulevé essentiellement les mêmes motifs de risque dans les demandes CH et d'ERAR, et il n'est pas déraisonnable de penser que le vocabulaire employé pour évaluer ces risques sera forcément semblable. Hormis cette similarité, rien n'indique que l'agente a appliqué un mauvais critère en ce qui a trait à la demande CH.
Le traitement par l'agente de la preuve au dossier était-il déraisonnable?
[20]
En vertu de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la Loi ;
a. le demandeur qui a été débouté de sa demande d'asile ne peut présenter que des éléments de preuve survenus depuis le rejet ou qui n'étaient alors pas normalement accessibles ou, s'ils l'étaient, qu'il n'aurait pas normalement présentés, dans les circonstances, au moment du rejet;
[21]
La question soumise à l'agente, dès lors, était de savoir si le demandeur avait démontré qu'il était exposé à des risques futurs en Éthiopie à la lumière d'éléments de preuve qui ne figuraient pas au dossier de la SPR. Le demandeur a fait valoir les mêmes risques dans le cadre de sa demande d'ERAR que devant la SPR. Bien que le demandeur ait présenté plusieurs documents faisant état des risques grandissants que courent les opposants en Éthiopie, il n'a fourni aucune preuve hormis sa simple affirmation qu'il était un membre de l'opposition, affirmation que la SPR n'a pas crue. C'est ce à quoi l'agente fait référence lorsqu'elle déclare:
[traduction] Je constate que le nom [du demandeur] n'est pas mentionné dans les documents et qu'il n'a pas indiqué de quelle manière ces documents sont liés aux risques futurs et personnels auxquels il serait exposé en Éthiopie.
[22]
Étant donné qu'il appartient au demandeur de démontrer, à la lumière de nouveaux éléments de preuve, qu'il était exposé à un risque vu son adhésion à un parti, il était raisonnable pour l'agente d'examiner les documents afin de vérifier si le nom du demandeur y figurait comme membre de l'opposition. Il était également raisonnable pour l'agente de conclure que, faute de preuve indiquant que le demandeur était effectivement membre de l'opposition, les risques dont faisaient état les documents relatifs au pays étaient généralisés. La conclusion de l'agente, à savoir que le demandeur n'avait pas établi le risque mentionné dans la demande d'ERAR, était raisonnable.
[23]
L'agente a pris en considération les lettres du psychiatre. Elles révèlent que les troubles psychiatriques du demandeur n'ont commencé qu'après la décision de la SPR. Il n'était pas déraisonnable de conclure que cela découlait de l'échec de sa demande et non pas des conditions auxquelles il avait été confronté en Éthiopie avant son arrivée au Canada. Les lettres mentionnent que des médicaments ont été prescrits pour traiter son état, mais elles ne renferment pas de renseignements concernant l'accessibilité des médicaments en Éthiopie. L'agente a raisonnablement accordé une faible valeur probante à ces éléments de preuve relativement à la demande d'ERAR et à l'évaluation des difficultés.
[24]
En outre, l'agente a raisonnablement traité des autres aspects de la décision relative à la demande CH. Il ne suffit pas à un demandeur d'affirmer que l'agente aurait pu conclure que les éléments preuve qu'il a soumis témoignant de son établissement au Canada entraîneraient des difficultés s'il faisait l'objet d'une mesure de renvoi. L'agente a passé en revue tous les éléments de preuve pertinents et il lui était loisible de tirer cette conclusion. La Cour ne peut intervenir que si la décision était déraisonnable, en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit »: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 59. Ce n'était pas le cas en l'espèce.
L'agente a-t-elle omis de prendre en considération un motif de risque invoqué par le demandeur à l'appui de sa demande d'ERAR
?
[25]
Le demandeur a également soutenu que l'agente n'a pas recherché s'il était exposé à un risque du simple fait de son retour à titre de demandeur d'asile débouté. Comme le défendeur l'a fait remarquer, le demandeur n'avait pas soulevé ce motif de risque dans ses observations à l'appui de sa demande d'ERAR, mais plutôt dans sa demande CH. Bien qu'elles aient été prises en considération par la même agente, il s'agissait de demandes distinctes. Si elles avaient été traitées séparément par des agents différents, le demandeur n'aurait pas eu l'avantage de voir les motifs soulevés dans sa demande CH soumis à l'agente saisie de sa demande d'ERAR.
[26]
Soutenir que le fait que l'agente n'a pas pris en considération les motifs soulevés dans une demande distincte est une erreur susceptible de contrôle serait accorder aux demandeurs d'asile dont les demandes sont traitées ensemble une plus grande protection qu'à ceux dont les demandes sont traitées séparément. Une erreur susceptible de contrôle ne saurait résulter des simples particularités du calendrier d'audition des affaires. Quoi qu'il en soit, l'agente a reconnu le facteur de risque allégué dans sa décision sur la demande d'ERAR.
[27]
Les éléments de preuve invoqués au soutien de ce motif ont principalement trait au grand nombre de rapatriés expulsés des pays africains adjacents et d'extradition de personnes en provenance de pays plus développés, pour des motifs d'inadmissibilité semble-t-il. Ils n'établissent pas que le demandeur se trouve dans une situation semblable à ces personnes et qu'il serait exposé à un risque du simple fait de son retour après le rejet d'une demande d'asile à l'étranger. De la même façon, les éléments de preuve ne montrent pas qu'il serait exposé à un risque en raison de son profil à titre d'athlète de calibre international de retour au pays. Faute de preuve, l'argument revient à reprocher à l'agente de ne pas avoir fait de conjectures sur ce qui risquerait de se produire.
[28]
Les éléments de preuve n'établissent pas que le degré d'oppression envers les membres de l'opposition a augmenté après les élections de 2005, qui ont vu le retour d'un grand nombre d'entre eux à l'assemblée législative. Toutefois, comme l'a fait remarquer la SPR, le demandeur n'avait pas le profil d'un militant de l'opposition avant de quitter l'Éthiopie, et la SPR n'a pas cru qu'il était membre d'un parti d'opposition. L'agente n'avait pas besoin de réexaminer ces conclusions.
[29]
Je crois comprendre que le demandeur bénéficie de l'appui de plusieurs membres de la collectivité, qui estiment qu'il a apporté et pourrait continuer d'apporter une contribution valable à la société canadienne. Ainsi, il a participé à la formation et au mentorat de jeunes dans les sports de course. Pour gagner sa vie, il a démarré une petite entreprise, qui compte des employés. C'est la preuve de sa détermination à s'établir au Canada. Mais la question dont je suis saisi n'est pas à savoir s'il est équitable pour monsieur Eshete de demeurer au Canada, mais si les décisions de l'agente n'appartiennent pas aux issues acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Je ne suis pas en mesure de tirer cette conclusion.
[30]
Aucune question d'importante générale n'a été proposée et aucune ne sera certifiée par la Cour.
