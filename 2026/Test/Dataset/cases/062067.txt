Teitlebaum, J.
: These reasons shall apply to all three files, in that, all cases relate to the same cause of action.
[2]
These reasons apply to the application of the plaintiff against the defendants, whereby plaintiff makes an application requesting an order issue to have defendants produce all survey reports which they may have had prepared with regard to alleged damages to cargo. These reasons also apply to the application of the defendant Cormorant Bulk Carriers Ltd. wherein this defendant requests the issuance of an order directed to the plaintiff ordering it to produce all survey reports it had prepared regarding the alleged damages to the cargo in issue.
[3]
After reading the affidavits filed by the parties, after listening to the able submissions of the respective counsel, it is apparent that all the survey reports, with the exception of what will be referred to as the "Singapore Report" were not prepared in contemplation of litigation and thus cannot be considered as privileged. These reports, were prepared in the "ordinary course" of cargo damage claims soon after discharge of the cargo and thus cannot be considered as if these reports were prepared in anticipation of litigation.
The Facts
[4]
By various Bills of Lading, plaintiff alleges the defendants were to carry cargo to Madras, India and to Bombay, India. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants delivered the goods to the plaintiff "with shortage and damaged by saltwater". As a result of these damages, the plaintiff and the defendants Botelho Shipping Corp. and Cormorant Bulk Carriers Ltd. had various survey reports prepared.
Issue
[5]
Are the parties to these proceedings obliged to file the survey reports upon being requested to do so?
The Law
[6]
I am satisfied that the parties to these proceedings must produce their survey reports unless a party refusing to do so, can, and the onus is on that party, show that the said report was privileged, that is, it was prepared "for the purpose of being laid before a solicitor or counsel for the purpose of obtaining his advice or of enabling him to prosecute or defend an action or prepare a brief; and for the purpose of litigations existing or in contemplation at the time". Furthermore, it is "only after all attempts at settlement had failed could it be said that there was a "reasonable expectation of litigation" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at pp. 297 and 298).
[7]
In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where a defendant had carried out a survey report for which privilege was claimed, Mr. Justice Strayer states at pp. 266 and 267:
"The plaintiffs seek damages for injuries allegedly caused to kraft paper rolls purchased by the plaintiffs in Canada and carried by the defendants' ships from Canada to Japan.
"In each case the defendants have in part 2 of Schedule I of their list of documents listed an 'Aall & Company Limited Survey Report' with respect to which they claim privilege.
. . . . .
"I will first set out what I understand to be the principles upon which such applications should be decided. The onus is on the party claiming a privilege to establish it:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). It is now also clear that such party must establish that the
dominant
purpose for which the material is prepared was a privileged one.
. . . . .
"The basis for the claim of privilege in the present case is that the survey reports were prepared for purposes of litigation. As held by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 297-298, to make out such a claim it must be shown that such third party material must have been prepared both for the purpose of being provided to counsel
and
for the purpose of counsel using it in respect of litigation existing, or in contemplation, at the time of its preparation.
"As noted above, the onus is on the defendants in these two cases to show that the survey reports come within these requirements. The only evidence provided by the defendants was a telex, verified by affidavit, sent by John Solberg, Director, Claims and Insurance, of Gearbulk Ltd., one of the defendants in each case. This telex states as follows:
'We confirm that surveys are conducted on forest product cargo carried from British Columbia to Japan aboard  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ships solely for the purpose of obtaining a reliable record of the condition of the cargo on discharge to resist claims for damage which may later be in whole or in part wrongfully made and become the subject of litigation.'"
[8]
Clearly the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case stands for the principle that the
onus
is on the party claiming privilege and what must be clearly shown is that the dominant purpose of the preparation of the survey report was in respect of litigation and where there was a "reasonable expectation of litigation".
Conclusion
[9]
Counsel for the defendant Botelho Shipping Corp. submits that one of his three survey reports, the one referred to as the "Singapore Report" was prepared in contemplation of litigation. He submits that the "Singapore Report" was not prepared in the "usual course" of having such reports prepared as it was not prepared at or near discharge and that it was prepared for the P & I Club (Protection & Indemnity) which only becomes involved when there is a third party claim.
[10]
In an affidavit of David F. McEwen, filed with plaintiff's notice of motion, he states in paragraphs 17 and 18:
"In my 24 years of handling cargo damage litigation, it is my experience that when cargo is damaged, it is part of the standard and usual routine for the P & I Club in which the vessel is entered to instruct a surveyor to examine the cargo and the vessel in order to obtain information about the damage. I verily believe that the purpose of such surveys is to record the condition of cargo upon discharge to allow the P & I Club to consider coverage and possible defence of a claim.
"In many of these matters, no formal claim is ever brought, in others a claim is made but resolved with the vessel's agent, or the P & I Club representative, and litigation is not commenced in many cases in which cargo is damaged, nor are solicitors involved in that claim process."
[11]
It thus appears that Mr. McEwen is of the belief that such survey reports prepared for the P & I Club
are not
prepared with a "reasonable expectation of litigation" but "in order to obtain information about the damage" as well as "to record the condition of cargo upon discharge to allow the P & I Club to consider coverage and
possible
defence of a claim".
[12]
The defendant Botelho Shipping Corp. filed the affidavit of J.D.L. Morrison, Barrister and Solicitor, who states at paragraph 11:
"... and I verily believe that they appoint surveyors, not as a rule but in cases of alleged major cargo damage, and for the purpose of assessing the nature, cause and degree of the damage alleged, for the purposes of defence of litigation likely to be commenced by cargo owners ... Shipowners, of course, do not own the cargo, and thus the P & I Clubs do not insure the shipowners for direct loss accordingly. The P & I Associations only become involved if a third party cargo owner or party otherwise interested in the cargo commences action against the shipowner, whose liability is insured with the P & I Association."
[13]
I am satisfied that Mr. Morrison is giving evidence in a general manner as to why he believes the P & I Associations appoint a surveyor. There is no evidence in Mr. Morrison's affidavit as to why, in this case, the surveyor was requested to prepare the report in issue. There is no suggestion that any of the surveyor's reports prepared for this defendant was with a "reasonable expectation of litigation".
[14]
As stated by Mr. Justice Strayer in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case (supra), the onus is on the party claiming privilege to show that the report was prepared with a "reasonable expectation of litigation". This the defendant has failed to do.
[15]
Furthermore, Mr. Morrison states in the last sentence of paragraph 11 of his affidavit that "the P & I Associations only become involved if a third party cargo owner or party otherwise interested in the cargo commences action ...". When the "Singapore Report" was prepared, no action had been commenced.
[16]
I have had the opportunity to read the "Singapore Report" and notice that the report stated:
"This Is To Certify that we, the undersigned Marine Surveyors did, at the request of Messrs. Boustead Services Pte Ltd., Singapore on behalf of The Britannia Steam Ship Insurance Association Ltd. attend at Eastern Anchorage, Singapore on 24 December 1988 for the purpose of ascertaining the cause, nature and extent of damage sustained to the cargo onboard M.V. 'Philippine Victory', allegedly caused by the vessel encountering heavy weather at sea and we report as follows:"
[17]
I am satisfied that the report was prepared for the purpose stated in the report, that is, "of ascertaining the cause, nature and extent of damage sustained to the cargo onboard M.V. 'Philippine Victory' ...".
[18]
The survey was requested on December 24, 1988. I am satisfied that there was no "reasonable expectation of litigation" at this time.
[19]
Therefore, all survey reports should be produced.
[20]
Costs in the cause.
Order accordingly.
