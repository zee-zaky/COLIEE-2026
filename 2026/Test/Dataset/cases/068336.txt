Tremblay-Lamer, J.
: This is an appeal pursuant to s. 56(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
[see footnote 1] ("
Act
") from the decision of the Registrar of Trademarks refusing the appellant's application for registration of the word "Export" for use in association with brewed alcoholic beverages.
[2]
On June 28, 1985, the appellant's predecessor-in-title filed the said application which was based upon use in Canada since 1903. On July 18, 1986, the respondents [see footnote 2] opposed the application on two grounds: (1) that the word "Export" is not registrable under s. 12(1)(b) of the
Act
because it is either clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of the character or quality of brewed alcohol, and (2) that the word "Export" is a nondistinctive term which is not registrable pursuant to s. 38(2)(d) of the
Act
.
[3]
On May 20, 1988, the appellant amended its application for registration in order to claim the benefit of s. 12(2) of the
Act
. That subsection permits the registration of a trademark which is clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive and which would not be registrable under s. 12(1)(b), if the mark has been so used in Canada by the applicant so as to have become distinctive at the date of filing the application.
Decision Of The Registrar
[4]
The Registrar rejected the application. With respect to the first ground of opposition, he held that the word "Export" was descriptive and therefore not registrable pursuant to s. 12(1)(b) of the
Act
. In reaching his conclusion, the Registrar relied in part on definitions of the word found in
Webster's Third New International Dictionary
[see footnote 3] ("suitable or designed for exportation") [see footnote 4] and from
The
Oxford English Dictionary
[see footnote 5] ("[d]esignating an article of a quality suitable for exporting, usually of better quality than that made for home consumption ... beer of export quality; a glass of this beer"). [see footnote 6]
[5]
He also considered the respondents' evidence which showed use of the impugned mark by third-parties in association with beer. He did not find this evidence particularly significant but he thought it still served to reinforce the position that the appellant's mark is clearly descriptive of brewed alcoholic beverages.
[6]
Moreover, he accorded little weight to the appellant's evidence, particularly to the affidavit of David J. Pye [see footnote 7], a research methodologist whose company designed and conducted a survey to determine the reaction of consumers to the "Export" mark. The survey was restricted to the province of Ontario and the results were insufficient to support a decision that the mark was descriptive of the appellant's wares throughout Canada. [see footnote 8]
[7]
The Registrar also rejected the appellant's claim to registrability under s. 12(2) of the
Act
, holding that it had failed to meet the evidential burden on it to show that its mark was distinctive at the date of the filing of the application. Again, he gave little weight to the Pye affidavit due to perceived ambiguities in the possible interpretation of the survey's findings.
[8]
Finally, given the previous conclusion, the respondents were also successful on the second ground of opposition.
[9]
The appellant now asks the court to set aside the decision of the Registrar. It does not challenge the finding that the word "Export" is descriptive. Rather, it argues that the mark has become distinctive of its brewed beverages and that the application for registration should be allowed by virtue of s. 12(2) of the
Act
. It also asks that the registration be restricted to Ontario and Quebec pursuant to s. 32(2) of the
Act
.
Issues
[10]
This appeal raises two issues:
1. Has the appellant met the burden of establishing that as of the date of filing the application, the word "Export" had become distinctive of its wares, thereby entitling it to registration pursuant to s. 12(2) of the
Act
?
2. Have the respondents met their burden of establishing that the word "Export" is not distinctive of the appellant's wares pursuant to s. 38(2)(d) of the
Act
?
Analysis
1. Should The Appeal Be Treated As A Trial De Novo?
[11]
It has been held that where the court has the benefit of considering new evidence, its discretion is totally unfettered by the previous decision of the Registrar. [see footnote 9] However, the new evidence must be significant enough to warrant a trial de novo. As stated by Strayer, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  treat the matter as completely de novo without regard to the chairman's decisions. While I accept that these appeals involve determinations of fact which I am entitled as a registrar to make, in my view the court should be reluctant to reverse the finding of the registrar or chairman unless it is clearly satisfied that he came to the wrong conclusion on the facts or unless there is
significant new evidence place before the court that was not before the registrar
." [see footnote 11] (Emphasis added)
[12]
It is the appellant's contention that it has submitted significant additional evidence which was not before the Registrar. The new evidence is directed towards establishing that the word "Export" has acquired distinctiveness in Ontario and Quebec. In particular, the affidavits of Blair Shier [see footnote 12] and Harold Moran [see footnote 13], neither of which were considered by the Registrar, provide evidence of significant advertising expenditures and sales and volume figures for the "Export" brand ale in Ontario and Quebec from 1976 to 1990. The additional evidence also establishes that the respondents filed an application to register "Export" (application No. 665,504) as a trademark on behalf of their wholly-owned subsidiary, Oland Breweries Limited, restricting its registration to the Maritime provinces. [see footnote 14]
[13]
The respondents also filed additional evidence in reply, in particular the affidavits of Bernard Beasley [see footnote 15] and John Tilden. [see footnote 16]
[14]
The respondents submit that a trial de novo is not warranted because the appellant's affidavits do not provide any significant additional evidence related to a relevant issue. I disagree. The advertisement and sales figures in the Shier and Moran affidavits were not before the Registrar [see footnote 17] and go directly to the issue of registrability under s. 12(2) of the
Act
. Furthermore, application No. 665,504 is also relevant new evidence. Therefore, by reason of the significant additional evidence filed by the parties, this appeal should be treated as a trial de novo.
2. Has The Appellant Met The Burden Of Establishing That As Of The Date Of Filing The Application, The Word "Export" Had Become Distinctive Of Its Wares, Thereby Entitling It To Registration Pursuant To S. 12(2) Of The Act?
[15]
A trademark which is not registrable by virtue of s. 12(1)(b) of the
Act
, may, notwithstanding, be registrable pursuant to s. 12(2) if it is shown that it has become distinctive of the applicant's wares (i.e., to have acquired a second meaning). Section 12(2) of the
Act
reads as follows:
"12(2) A trademark that is not registrable by reason of paragraph (1)(a) or (b) is registrable if it has been so used in Canada by the applicant or his predecessor in title as to have become distinctive at the date of filing an application for its registration."
"12(2) Une marque de commerce qui n'est pas enregistrable en raison de l'alinéa (1)a) ou b) peut être enregistrée si elle a été employée au Canada par le requérant ou son prédécesseur en titre de façon à être devenue distinctive à la date de la production d'une demande d'enregistrement la concernant."
[16]
"Distinctive" is defined in s. 2:
"'distinctive', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted so to distinguish them;"
"'distinctive' Relativement à une marque de commerce, celle qui distingue véritablement les marchandises ou services en liaison avec lesquels elle est employée par son propriétaire, des marchandises ou services d'autres propriétaires, ou qui est adaptée à les distinguer ainsi."
[17]
The onus of proving that a trademark satisfies the distinctive requirement of s. 12(2) is on the applicant. No word is precluded from registration as a trademark, but the burden of proving its distinctiveness is directly proportional to its inherent descriptiveness. [see footnote 18] In the case at bar, the word "Export" is normally descriptive of a type of beer, one that is of such a quality as to be destined for foreign markets. [see footnote 19] Therefore, the appellant must successfully discharge itself of a very heavy burden before being able to establish that its trademark is distinctive.
[18]
The respondents submit that for the appellant to be successful on this appeal, it has to show that it used the "Export" mark
exclusively
during a period of time. The respondent's evidence shows the contrary. In particular, the affidavit of Holly Huard [see footnote 20] shows that there are nine other trademarks on the Trademarks Register incorporating the word "Export" for use in association with various beverages. [see footnote 21] The Johnston [see footnote 22], Beasley and Tilden affidavits also show use of marks incorporating the word "Export" in the Atlantic provinces [see footnote 23], in Saskatchewan [see footnote 24] and in Ontario [see footnote 25], all in association with beer. The Beasley and Tilden affidavits further indicate that OLAND "Export" has been used in association with beer since at least 1925. The Beasley affidavit also provides evidence of sales in Ontario of two brands of beer - XXB ALE and DOUBLE DIAMOND - whose labels bear the word "Export", as well as a London, Ontario newsletter discussing the sale in Ontario of GOESSER EXPORT and SWAN LAGER EXPORT.
[19]
I disagree that the appellant has to show exclusive use of the trademark in order to meet the requirements of s. 12(2). Nowhere is this alleged requirement mentioned in s. 12. Neither is it included in the definition of the term "distinctive" in s. 2. Where exclusivity of use or of rights is provided for in the
Act
, it is
expressly
stated. [see footnote 26] It follows that if the legislator is silent on a requirement of exclusivity in the definition of distinctive, it intended to be so. This view is expressed by H.G. Fox [see footnote 27] and is based on the decisions of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  influenced by a claim of distinctiveness must depend upon all the circumstances including the area within which and the time during which such distinctiveness in fact can be predicated of the mark in question. Distinctiveness in fact is now the test and it will be for a court to decide, in any particular case, whether actual distinctiveness has been proved over a sufficiently wide area to allow it to be said that a trademark actually distinguishes. This is a question of fact depending upon the circumstances disclosed in evidence. But the necessity of universal distinctiveness is apparently being gradually watered down." [see footnote 30]
[20]
It is sufficient that the mark be distinctive to a substantial portion of the relevant public. [see footnote 31]
[21]
Furthermore, it was recognized in
Great Lakes Hotels
that a trademark need not distinguish the wares of its owner throughout Canada. [see footnote 32] A trademark is registrable as long as it distinguishes those wares in a restricted area in which registration is sought.
[22]
Thus, evidence of sales in an area where no registration is sought is immaterial. The evidence of use of the trademark OLAND EXPORT in the Maritimes will therefore be disregarded considering that the benefit of s. 12(2) is restricted to Ontario and Quebec. Only evidence of use of the trademark in this geographical area is relevant.
[23]
In this respect, the only evidence submitted by the respondent of use of the word "Export" as a trademark in Ontario is in association with brewed beverages sold in small quantities (such as Henninger Export) [see footnote 33] or imported beers that are also sold in small quantities (such as XXB ALE, DOUBLE DIAMOND, GOESSER EXPORT, SWAN LAKE EXPORT) [see footnote 34]. However, this evidence cannot be relied on by this court since it relates to sales of beer which took place after the material date, i.e., June 28, 1985. [see footnote 35]
[24]
As for the appellant, it submits that the evidence it filed on this appeal is sufficient to entitle it to the benefit of s. 12(2) of the
Act
. To better understand its claim, I will briefly summarize its evidence.
[25]
First, the Shier and Moran affidavits
which were not before the Registrar
disclose the following:
a) "Export" brand ale has been continuously sold in both Ontario and Quebec by Molson since 1955;
b) From 1976 to 1985 inclusive, Molson sold in excess of 19.4 million hectolitres of its "Export" brand ale in Ontario and Quebec;
c) From 1976 to 1985 inclusive, Molson expended in excess of $25 million in advertising its "Export" brand ale through the media of television, radio, and printed publications;
d) The trademark "Export" has been prominently displayed by Molson on labels affixed to the bottles and on the cartons in which the bottles of "Export" brand ale are packaged and sold.
[26]
Second, there is the affidavit of David Pye, the research methodologist who was commissioned by the appellant to conduct a study relating to consumer perception of the word "Export" in association with beer. The results of the survey purportedly support the conclusion that the "Export" mark is distinctive of the appellant's brand of ale.
[27]
Two questions were asked of the respondents: (1) "Thinking now of beer and ale, what is the first thing that comes into your mind when you hear the word 'Export'?"; (2) "Which brewery do you think makes a brand of beer or ale named 'Export'?". Pye suggests that 20.1% of respondents identified "Export" as a type of beer, 22.5% of respondents answered Molson in response to the first question, and 59% associated a brand of beer called "Export" with Molson.
[28]
Third, the appellant submits that in another opposition proceeding (application No. 665504), Labatt took the position that the word "Export" is registrable. In that application, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oland Breweries Limited, tried to register the word "Export" as a trademark in association with brewed alcoholic beverages in the Maritime provinces. More specifically, in a letter to the Registrar dated January 3, 1995, Labatt claimed:
"Firstly, we would point out that the present applicant is the owner of several registrations - see attached - directed to design trademarks which include the mark 'OLAND EXPORT' 'OLAND(S)' being the 'house mark' (also see attached) of the applicant. Moreover, 'OLAND EXPORT', the word mark was allowed and published by the Trademark Office although it is now in opposition.
Consequently, since 'OLAND' is the house mark, 'Export', per se, is the primary or product trademark.
"Secondly, the claimed mark has been used in Canada for an extensive period of time -since at least 1925, nearly 70 years. We enclose an Affidavit of John Tilden, Manager, Business Forecasting of Labatt, in which he details the sales by the present applicant of its 'Export' brand of beer since 1971 in the Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. We respectfully request the benefit of s. 12(2) for this application." [see footnote 36] (My emphasis)
[29]
In support of its application, Labatt filed the Tilden [see footnote 37] affidavit which provided the volume of sales of Oland's "Export" brand of ale in the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island from 1976 to 1990. It should be noted that, from 1976 to 1985, Oland sold approximately 1.35 million hectolitres of its "Export" brand of ale. This was sufficient evidence to satisfy the Registrar that the application was entitled to the benefit of s. 12(2). According to the appellant, such an admission against interest made in another proceeding is admissible and ought to be given some weight.
[30]
The issue is now whether the above evidence is sufficient to establish the appellant's claim that its "Export" mark has acquired distinctiveness in Ontario and Quebec.
[31]
I agree with the Registrar that the Pye affidavit could not in itself establish the appellant's claim to the benefit of s. 12(2). In this respect
,
I accept that the respondents' remarks on the flaws in the methodology of the survey are valid.
[32]
The Pye affidavit was sworn by the designer of the survey, who hired another company to actually conduct it. The affiant was not present while the surveys were conducted, was not involved in the survey's completion and can provide no direct evidence of the manner in which questionnaires were completed.
[33]
The survey was only conducted in certain locations in Ontario. It cannot provide any indication of distinctiveness elsewhere in Ontario, or for that matter, anywhere in Quebec.
[34]
No control questions were asked to ensure that the respondents had an understanding of what was being asked of them.
[35]
"Word association" surveys are a poor method of proving the thought patterns of consumers in every day life. This is all the more so considering that in the case at bar artificial stimuli were introduced into the questions, which possibly led the respondents to take cues from the questions in making judgments. The questions were put in such a manner as to elicit the type of answers sought by the appellant.
[36]
There are also problems in the way Mr. Pye interpreted the results. For example, in response to the first question, he suggests that 20.1% of respondents identified "Export" as a "type of beer". However, such a result may merely indicate that a large number of the respondents identified it as designating a premium beer or a beer of export quality.
[37]
Consequently, I give little weight to the survey itself. Nevertheless, it bolsters the evidence found in the Moran and Shier affidavits. As I indicated earlier, these affidavits provide evidence of extensive sales figures and advertising expenditures for the "Export" brand both in Ontario and Quebec:
SALES VOLUMES

1979	In excess of $1,000,000
1980	In excess of $1,000,000
1981	In excess of $4,000,000
1982	In excess of $5,000,000
1983	In excess of $5,000,000
1984	In excess of $6,000,000
1985	In excess of $7,000,000
[38]
The affidavits also confirm the widespread public recognition of the word "Export" with a brand of beer produced by Molson:
"It can be seen from the survey evidence of Mr. Pye that the consumers of brewed alcoholic beverages in Ontario would recognize the word 'Export' as designating a brand of beer of the Molson Brewing Group. This is consistent with the extensive sales and advertising of 'Export' brand brewed alcoholic beverages in Ontario and Quebec for many years, which has resulted in such public recognition." [see footnote 40]
[39]
This assertion is consistent with the Pye survey. One of the questions asked in the survey was: "Which brewery makes a brand of beer called 'Export'?". About 70% of the consumers surveyed identified Molson.
[40]
Further, I accept the evidence of Mr. Shier and Mr. Moran that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is in effect a "house mark" of Molson Breweries and that "Export" is a brand of beer sold by Molson Breweries. In fact, all the labels of the Molson family contain the house mark  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in conjunction with the brand names: CANADIAN, GOLDEN, or "Export". [see footnote 41]
[41]
In fact, the respondents took the same position in file 665504 where they advised the Registrar that "Export" per se is the primary or product trademark.
[42]
In my opinion, such a statement is admissible as an admission against interest. As stated in
Wigmore on Evidence
: [see footnote 42]
"But when offered
against
the party [statements made out of court by a party-opponent] have additionally, the same logical status as a
witness' self-contradiction
. Just as a witness' testimony is discredited when it appears that on another occasion he has made a statement inconsistent with his present claim against him, so also the party-opponent is discredited when it appears that on some other occasion he has made a statement inconsistent with his present claim against him. ...
"Thus, in effect and broadly,
anything said by the party-opponent may be used against him as an admission
, provided it exhibits the quality of inconsistency with the facts now asserted by him in pleadings or in testimony. (This proviso never needs to be enforced, because no party offers thus his opponent's statement unless it does appear to be inconsistent.)" [see footnote 43]
[43]
Contrary to what the respondents suggest, their statement cannot be dismissed as legal manoeuvring. In file 665504, Labatt
filed the Tilden affidavit in support of Oland's claim to the benefit of s. 12(2). The affidavit shows significant sales of its product in the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island from 1976 to 1990. Labatt took the position that this type of evidence was sufficient to support its claim. The Registrar agreed with it. Labatt should not, therefore, be allowed to resile from this position.
[44]
After having reviewed the evidence, I am satisfied that it establishes the distinctiveness of the "Export" trademark in Ontario and Quebec. I am further convinced of it after considering this court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  was distinctive of the appellant's television tuners on the basis of extensive sales and advertising expenditures and was therefore entitled to the benefit of s. 12(2) of the
Act
. The following evidence was before the court:
(A) Sales between 1955 to 1966 totalling $22,366,000.000 representing 2 million units;
(B) Sales between 1967 to 1970 of approximately $2,000,000.00 per year representing an additional 80,000 units;
(C) Advertising expenditures of $50,000.00.
[46]
The affidavits of 10 persons who were managers and sales persons confirmed the significance of these figures. The same evidence was filed in the case at bar. The Shier and Moran affidavits support the findings of the survey and confirm that the extensive sales and advertising expenditures resulted in public recognition of the word "Export" as a brand of beer. [see footnote 45]
[47]
I therefore conclude that the appellant is entitled to registration of its mark pursuant to s. 12(2) of the
Act
.
3.
Have The Respondents Met Their Burden Of Establishing That The Word "Export" Is Not Distinctive Of The Appellant's Wares Pursuant To Section 38(2)(d) Of The Act?
[48]
Section 38(2)(d) of the
Act
reads as follows:
"38(2) A statement of opposition may be based on any of the following grounds:
(d) that the trademark is not distinctive."
"38(2) Cette opposition peut être fondée sur l'un des motifs suivants:
(d) la marque de commerce n'est pas distinctive."
[49]
Although the legal burden remains on the applicant to prove that the mark is distinctive [see footnote 46], the opponent still has an evidentiary burden of demonstrating sufficient use by itself or third parties to negate distinctiveness. [see footnote 47]
[50]
The first issue in dispute is the material date for determining distinctiveness. Section 38(2)(d) does not indicate any date as such. The appellant contends that it is the date of the opposition (July 18, 1986), whereas the respondents say it is the date of the Registrar's decision (November 22, 1995). If the former proposition is accepted, then the second ground of opposition becomes moot: between the date of filing the application (June 28, 1985) and the date of filing the opposition (July 18, 1986), there was no evidence of a change in market conditions which would have adversely affected
the distinctiveness of Molson's "Export" trademark.
[51]
There is a long line of authority which stands for the proposition that the relevant date for determining the question of distinctiveness is the date of filing the opposition. [see footnote 48] For example, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wording of s. 37(2)(d) the material time for this purpose appears to me to be the date of the filing of the opposition but on the facts of the present case, as I view them, the same result would ensue whether that or the time of the filing of the application is taken as the material time." [see footnote 50]
[52]
However, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relevant date was the date of disposition of the opposition or the date of the Registrar's decision.
[53]
Denault, J., based his decision on that of Desjardins, J.A.'s, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as to the material date, the general rule is that the date where the matter is disposed of is the relevant date for determining registrability. In particular, Desjardins, J.A., wrote:
"The
Trade-marks Act
contains provisions which indicate the date at which certain situations are to be assessed. For instance, s. 16(1) of the
Act
refers to the date the mark was first used or was made known in relation to wares or services as the date where confusion is to be assessed. Section 16(3) of the
Act
refers to the date of filing of the application as the date where confusion is to be assessed. Section 6(5) of the
Act
, however, contains no indication as to the material date for determining whether trademarks or tradenames are confusing. In such circumstances, the rule generally applicable in adjudicating matters should prevail, that is the date where the matter is disposed of on the evidence adduced." [see footnote 53]
[54]
She then went on to state that registrability should be decided at the date of registration or at the date of refusal of registration. Thus, Denault, J., found that it was also the relevant date for a determination of distinctiveness pursuant to s. 38(2)(d).
[55]
However, it is interesting to note that Desjardins, J.A., was only concerned with the issue of registrability and was silent on the issue of distinctiveness. In fact, she refers to the decision of
Andres Wines
and distinguished it on the basis that it dealt with distinctiveness. It follows, in my opinion, that the relevant date for assessing distinctiveness has not changed and remains the date of filing the opposition.
[56]
As pointed out by counsel for the appellant, when you file the statement of opposition you have to say
at that time
that the trademark is not distinctive. Furthermore, recent decisions have retained the date of the opposition as the material date for determining distinctiveness. In particular, there is Gibson, J.'s, decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  evidence to show a change of circumstances from the date of filing of the application to the date of filing of the statement of opposition, the issue is moot.
[58]
For the reasons stated above, the appeal is granted with costs.
Appeal allowed.
