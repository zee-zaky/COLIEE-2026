Richard, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated December 7, 1993 which determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee. The Board arrived at its decision on the basis of its finding of the applicant's complete lack of credibility.
[2]
The applicant asserts that the panel erred in law when it concluded, without regard to the applicant's birth certificate and internal passport, that the applicant was not of either the Jewish nationality or faith. Counsel for the applicant submits that the panel erred in law because it failed to give any weight whatsoever to these documents which it had accepted as exhibits at the hearing and with which no issue had been taken regarding their authenticity or veracity. Counsel for the applicant submits that both the birth certificate and the internal passport are proof that the applicant is of the Jewish faith and nationality.
[3]
The birth certificate of the applicant indicates that the nationality of both of her parents is Jewish. The internal passport of the applicant indicates that her nationality is Jewish.
[4]
One member of the panel in her reasons stated (at page 5):
"With respect to her Jewish nationality, I did not find the claimant to be credible."
Further this same member stated (at page 5):
"... it is only reasonable to expect that a claimant that states that she is Jewish, and practices her religion should have some knowledge of this religion which is more than vague and general. I, therefore, find that the claimant has not given us credible evidence to show that she is of the Jewish faith."
[5]
The second member of the panel, in a concurring decision, stated (at page 7)
"I agree that the claimant failed to meet the burden placed upon her to adduce credible and trustworthy evidence that she is of the Jewish nationality and faith."
[6]
In arriving at this finding, neither member of the panel made any reference to the two documents which had been introduced by the applicant: her birth certificate and her internal passport. The members of the panel based their decision on the oral testimony provided by the applicant concerning the issue of her religion, which they described as being uninformative, vague and evasive, and not reasonable. In particular, both members found that she was not familiar with the tenets of the Jewish faith, religious holidays, and religious practices.
[7]
Both members of the panel also commented unfavourably on the applicant's demeanour in giving her testimony and to contradictions or inconsistencies between the information on her personal information form and her sworn testimony, and in her sworn testimony itself.
[8]
Counsel for the respondent submits that the tribunal's decision that the applicant was not a Convention refugee was based on the ground that the applicant's testimony was not credible and trustworthy. The tribunal gave clear reasons for its credibility findings which were reasonably based on the evidence before it. Counsel also drew attention to the fact that the tribunal's credibility finding was in part based on the applicant's demeanour. Counsel for the respondent added that the tribunal's negative credibility finding with respect to the applicant's nationality did not relate to her de jure nationality but rather to her nationality in the sense of her faith or the practice of her religion. In the alternative, counsel conducted that the tribunal's negative credibility finding rested on several other findings which, in and of themselves, amply support the tribunal's ultimate conclusion.
[9]
It is to be noted that the tribunal did not rest its decision only on the applicant's failed claim of Jewish nationality and faith. The tribunal went on to find that the applicant had not presented any trustworthy or credible evidence on the material elements of her claim to show that she had well founded fear of persecution. In particular, both members of the panel found that there was no "serious possibility" or "reasonable chance" that the applicant would be persecuted for any of the reasons in the definition of a Convention refugee should she return to the Ukraine. The decision of the tribunal makes it clear that the members considered her evidence concerning the incidents of persecution to be vague, evasive and contradictory.
[10]
However, it is clear that one of the central findings of the tribunal was that the applicant had not provided any credible evidence to show that she was of the Jewish nationality or of the Jewish faith. In arriving at this conclusion the tribunal made no reference in its decision to the applicant's birth certificate and internal passport, which were filed by the applicant at the hearing in the original and whose authenticity was not questioned or challenged. The applicant based her claim to a well founded fear of persecution on two of the five recognized grounds: religion and nationality. The tribunal's finding that the applicant was not persecuted on a defined ground was based entirely on the applicant's oral testimony which the tribunal found not to be credible. It does not appear that the tribunal took account in any manner of the specific relevant documentary evidence which had been introduced at the hearing and whose authenticity had not been challenged.
[11]
In my view the tribunal erred in law in not considering the documentary evidence in support of the applicant's claim. The Board itself attached a great deal of importance to the applicant's claim of nationality and religion in its decision but ignored the documentary evidence submitted by the applicant which indicates her nationality to be Jewish. This documentary evidence was independent of her oral testimony and was not coloured by her own lack of credibility in the eyes of the Board. The applicant's claim of persecution is so intertwined with her claim of nationality and religion that it cannot be said with any assurance that the incidents of persecution she relied on would not be viewed different if the documentary evidence had led to a different finding on the issue of her nationality and religion. While a failure to recite all of the evidence does not necessarily result in a reviewable error, (for example, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (9 October 1992), No A-831-90 (F.C.A.).) the tribunal should address material evidence which specifically relates to the applicant's claim (for example, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (4 January 1994), No. A-1209-92 (F.C.T.D.)).
[12]
In this instance, the tribunal ought to have addressed the existence of the applicant's passport and birth certificate in relation to the enumerated grounds.
[13]
For these reasons, the application is allowed, the decision is quashed, and the matter is remitted to a differently constituted panel.
Application allowed.
