I.
Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
: The Applicant seeks a judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [Board], dated September 18, 2012, wherein, it was determined that he is neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under section 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001 c 27 [
IRPA
].
II.
Background
[2]
The Applicant, Mr. Mehmet Ali Atacan Yurtal, is a citizen of Turkey; and, was born in 1971. He is of Azerbaijani origin and practices the Christian faith for more than a decade.
[3]
The Applicant grew up in the province of Kars to a family of the Shia Caferi religious denomination.
[4]
In 1997, the Applicant became active in a leftist opposition political party [the Emek Partisi or EMEP]). He soon, thereafter, converted to Christianity in 2000.
[5]
In August 2000, the Applicant was arrested by the police because of his religious activities during which time he suffered beatings during his detention by the police.
[6]
The Applicant states that the police continued to harass him after this event; therefore, he decided to move from Istanbul to Ankara in April 2001.
[7]
In 2002, the Applicant related he was ambushed and severely beaten by a gang of Turkish extremist nationalists, after attending a church service in Ankara. A letter by Dr. Nurullah Zengin, dated August 3, 2012, confirms that the Applicant was admitted to hospital on July 21, 2002, for fractures suffered to his right arm and left elbow (Applicant's Record [AR] at pp 161-162).
[8]
In April 2007, the Applicant was arrested by police again, this time for putting up a banner over a bridge in Ankara in protest for the murder of three Christians in the neighbouring city of Malatya. He explained he was detained for questioning and again subject to beatings and torture. A letter by Dr. Nurullah Zengin, dated August 3, 2012, confirms that the Applicant was admitted to the hospital on April 27, 2007, for a dislocated left shoulder (AR at pp 163-164).
[9]
On May 1 2008, the Applicant testified he attended the May Day Rally with the EMEP in Istanbul, where police confronted demonstrators with armoured vehicles and shields, and used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The Applicant was apprehended by police, together with other demonstrators, and severely beaten.
[10]
In February 2009, the Applicant began working as a seaman for an international shipping company. He continued working in this capacity until November 2010.
[11]
In September 2009, the Applicant related that a Sunni neighbour complained to the police of his distributing brochures for his Christian Protestant church; after which, he was questioned in respect of his religious and political activities and beaten by the police.
[12]
In June 2010, the Applicant was again arrested for distributing brochures, subsequent to more complaints made to the police by the neighbours; thereupon, he was detained and again beaten by police.
[13]
In July 2010, after being rehired by the shipping company, the Applicant again left Turkey. The Applicant, as a member of the crew, travelled for four months on a cargo ship, stopping in multiple countries before eventually arriving in Canada. He docked in Quebec City on November 17, 2010.
[14]
On November 30, 2010, subsequent to leaving his ship and crew with its related duties, he travelled by bus to Toronto and claimed refugee protection.
[15]
The Board heard his claim on April 2, 2012 and also on July 19, 2012.
III.
Decision under Review
[16]
In its decision, dated September 18, 2012, the Board concluded that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The Board's conclusion was that the Applicant did not have a well-founded subjective or objective fear of persecution neither on religious nor political grounds.
Religious grounds
[17]
With respect to the Applicant's first allegation of persecution, based on religious grounds, the Board found that the Applicant failed to demonstrate that he feared persecution in Turkey. The Board determined that the alleged incidents on which the Applicant based his claim were isolated and termed them as random events, spanning a several year period that the Board considered neither repetitive nor persistent.
[18]
In assessing the Applicant's claim of persecution, the Board was of the opinion that there were irregularities in the Applicant's narrative which the Board determined pointed to a lack of subjective fear of persecution. For instance, although he specified a fear for his life as a Christian in a predominantly Muslim community, the Board reached the conclusion that, nevertheless, the Applicant did practice his religion for nearly 10 years, as he attended a (house) church regularly (where a pastor would come to officiate). The Board took the view that discrepancies existed between the Applicant's documentary evidence and oral testimony with regard to his religious activities between 2000 and 2009 (Record of Hearing of April 2, 2012 at pp 16-18). (A careful reading demonstrates that a misunderstanding may have arisen in that the Applicant specified he distributed brochures in respect of his Christian faith that were considered to be of a missionary nature in 2009, and, not in 2000 when he was a simple adherent.)
[19]
The Board also considered the Applicant's delay in seeking asylum in determining the well-foundedness of his subjective fear. The Board determined that the Applicant's delay in leaving Turkey was unreasonable, as, it did also in regard to his subsequent delay in seeking refugee status in Canada after having left his country. The Applicant arrived in Canada as a seaman in Quebec City on November 17, 2010 subsequent to which he took a bus to Toronto and filed his refugee claim on November 30, 2010 only after he left the crew of his ship, or only after he was able to leave the crew of his ship.
[20]
The Board ultimately found that the Applicant lacked both a subjective and an objective fear of persecution. In its reasons, the Board made specific reference to its above-noted concerns, as well as the International Religious Freedom Report 2010 [IRFR] (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] at p 72) which states that by 2010 "Christians and Baha'is engaging in religious advocacy were occasionally threatened or pressured by government and state officials" but that "the government
generally
respected religious freedom
in practice" [Emphasis added].
[21]
The Board decided to give only specifically chosen, selected documentary evidence considerable weight, finding no objective fear of persecution as opposed to discrimination which is discussed subsequently below.
Political grounds
[22]
The Board's analysis concluded that the Applicant's alleged persecution on grounds of political affiliation with the EMEP, was based on its finding of insufficient evidence for the Applicant to fear persecution by police.
[23]
According to the Board, the Applicant's alleged detention and torture during the May Day Rally of 2008 - that is the incident raised in the Applicant's narrative in regard to his political activities - resulted from the Applicant's own participation in general demonstrations and not necessarily due to his association to the EMEP. The Board concluded that no evidence existed that the police would have known of his membership in the EMEP. In the Board's view, the evidence demonstrated to it, that the Applicant had no political profile by which he would be a person of interest to the police; according to the Board, he was simply a member of the party with no titled position.
[24]
The Board concluded that it was not plausible that the event specified by the Applicant was related to the Applicant's membership in the EMEP; and, thus, the Applicant's alleged fear of persecution by the police was based on his political activities which, according to the Board, remained unfounded.
IV.
Issue
[25]
Did the Board err by misconstruing or ignoring evidence in its findings?
V.
Relevant Legislative Provisions
[26]
The following legislative provisions of the
IRPA
are relevant:
Convention refugee
96.
A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,

Person in need of protection
97.
(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally

(
b
) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,

(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
Définition de « réfugié »

(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
Personne à protéger
(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.
VI.
Standard of Review
[27]
The standard of review applicable to the Board's findings on credibility and subjective fear is that of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47).
[29]
The Court only intervenes in a credibility finding if the first instance, trier of fact, bases its decision on "an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or if it made its decision without regard to the material before it" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 886 (FCA)).
VII.
Position of the Parties
[30]
The essence of the Applicant's argument is that the Board committed a reviewable error by misconstruing and ignoring evidence in its assessment of credibility and subjective fear; namely, that of the documentary evidence related to membership in the EMEP and the Christian church, as well as that of the medical reports in support of the alleged incidents involving the police.
[31]
The Respondent submits that the Board considered the totality of the evidence in its findings on the Applicant's credibility and subjective fear.
VIII.
Analysis
[32]
The Board did not find that the point-specific documentary evidence with regard to the Applicant's membership to the Christian church, to the EMEP or to the medical reports had probative value by which to assess the well-foundedness of the Applicant's alleged fear of persecution.
[33]
With regard to the Applicant's claim of persecution based on religious grounds, the Court considers that the Board was unreasonable in its finding that the Applicant lacked a subjective fear of persecution. The Board drew a negative inference from the Applicant's ten-year delay in seeking asylum and his repeated re-availment to Turkey (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[34]
Although the jurisprudence is clear that a delay is not always determinative in a refugee claim, it may be a significant factor in determining a lack of subjective fear of persecution if explanations do not demonstrate otherwise. The Applicant stated that he had lost several members of his family and he did not want to leave even though his child was taken care of by its mother. (That matter was not adequately canvassed by the Board as no conclusive comment is made thereon by the Board in its decision, other than to infer lack of credibility.)
[35]
This Court also finds that the Board's conclusions on the Applicant's lack of subjective and objective fear were insufficient when read in respect of the totality of the transcript and written narrative when viewed in context. Without further questioning, more is unknown than is known on this matter, as key information in potential responses was not solicited due to a lack of pertinent questioning on the subject, questioning which needed to be conducted in an atmosphere conducive to such questioning. Although the hearing went on for two days, key elements concluded upon were unclear leading to a lack of reasonableness.
[36]
Although the IRFR report states that, in 2010, members of minority religious groups did, themselves, report that "they had freedom to practice their faith", that must be examined on a case by case basis as to specific facts and in context as to activities undertaken by minority religious groups. Improvements were not necessarily witnessed in several areas as specified in contrary objective documentation presented by the Applicant.
[37]
Certain reports clearly point to
societal persecution
, both of a verbal and physical abuse variety against religious groups,
the documentary evidence indicates that incidents were directed against all minority religious groups, not only Christians
. (
Does it make it better, or can it be considered evolutionary for the enhancement of human rights that the abuses were now generalized to all groups rather than one group
, which demonstrates that there is no distinction as to who is targeted amongst all minority groups; therefore, all are considered to be subjects of such.) The Applicant's own testimony bears this out (Record of Hearing of April 2, 2012 at p 18).
[38]
The Board cited the following in support of its reasoning, in 2010, although
"[m]any members of the public viewed religious pluralism as a threat to Islam and to 'national unity'"
[emphasis added], religious minority groups were, in a
limited
fashion, permitted to establish new religious community foundations as well as to reopen foundations which previously had been closed; and they could seek returns, or compensation on the basis of foundations which had been confiscated by the state authorities in previous decades. These were considered to be improvements; however, the ultimate pragmatic outcome is still yet to be witnessed in regard to protection of religious freedoms in Turkey; and, as yet, they are not indicative of a state that can be said to protect rights. Serious abuse and persecution still continues unabated as is evident on reading the documentary country condition evidence on a non-selective basis, if read in comprehensive context. (It is to be noted that other than mainstream Turkish religious group minorities constitute less than one percent of the country's population. The Exhibit - U.S. Department of State Report of November 17, 2010.)
[39]
The facts of this case do appear to reflect a failure of state protection and a conceivable pattern of systematic violence based on religion and political grounds for this Applicant on his specific evidence and grounds when he does anything in public view rather than worship in a house church he attended; this holds true, also, with regard to the Applicant's specific claim of persecution on political grounds as well as that of his alleged religious grounds as to his Christian Protestant faith and practice. (See objective evidence thereon, for example, on file, entitled "A threat" or under threat, Legal and Social Problems of Protestants in Turkey, 2010, by the Association of Protestant Churches Committee for Religious Freedom and Legal Affairs, where it is specified that Protestant denominations remain vulnerable in Turkey. See, also, Exhibit "A Ecumenical Patriarch on Christian Persecution in Turkey, December 23, 2009, www.catholics org.; reference is also made to the Exhibit entitled "Religious Freedom Survey, 2009, re "Serious Violations of Human Rights".)
[40]
It is fully recognized, as stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , for mistreatment to be considered "persecution", it must meet two criteria: it must be
serious
and it must be repetitive or systematic. Harassment or discrimination are not, in and of themselves, sufficient for such. Moreover, mistreatment must be truly demonstrative of "state protection" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 63). In the case of the Applicant, each time he was detained by the authorities or the victim of societal abuse, the situation appeared otherwise as it was serious and of peril to his person as per uncontradicted specific evidence.
[41]
Upon reviewing all of the evidence in the CTR and the submissions of the parties, this Court is persuaded that the Board erred in its conclusions with regard to the Applicant's subjective and objective fear of persecution by having ignored the evidence that must be adequately demonstrated, at least, to have been taken into account to reach any decision. As a specialized tribunal and finder of fact, the Board must, in some manner, account for pertinent evidence in respect of a specific applicant bearing specific evidence, and not assess in a generic nor amorphous manner, out of context.
[42]
The Board unsatisfactorily assessed and weighed the evidence, both, the personal evidence of the Applicant and the documentary evidence. Thus, it is not for this Court but only for the specialized tribunal as a finder of fact to ensure that its mandated jurisdiction is carried out according to its expertise with the evidence to bear such out. The Board's findings were unjustified by the weight it accorded to the evidence without a more substantial in-depth and breath analysis,
even if only briefly commented upon, or even merely alluded to, in a more directed manner, so as not to disregard pertinent evidence in its contextual setting
.
[43]
It is incumbent on the Board, as a result, to examine the (personal) subjective and objective evidence of the Applicant in his oral testimony and written materials which include
five uncontradicted arrests
,
detentions
and
incidents of violence
imposed on his person, none of which evidence had been specifically discredited in the reasons of the Board as per the comprehensive evidence on file. Numerous objective documentary elements of evidence pointed out by the Applicant simply remained wholly ignored.
[44]
The potential cumulative effects of the incidents were not found, in and of themselves, to lack credibility. They may, in fact, point to accumulated effects; this, too, needs specific analysis by the Board. Specific evidence from the church, political party and medical reports were discounted without any due explanation by the Board. This evidence may, in fact, have a cumulative effect, if credible.
[45]
The delay in respect of the actual claim for refugee status was explained by the Applicant. To be discounted by the Board, it too would have had to have been, at the very least, discussed in specific measure based on the Applicant's answers on file.
[46]
In conclusion, the oral testimony of the Applicant cannot simply be discounted if it is not contradicted by the Personal Information Form [PIF] nor lacking in inherent logic with the PIF.
[47]
It is not incumbent on the Board to write long explanations for such subject-matter but it must address such
; otherwise, the reasons can be said to be improperly motivated, lacking adequate assessment of what appears to be pertinent evidence.
It is reiterated by the Court that the how and what, when reached by the Board's eventual reasoning, is for the Board, itself, to determine as a specialized tribunal; that is for the specialized finder of fact to do but the key uncontradicted evidence must, at the very least, be addressed
.
IX.
Conclusion
[48]
For all of the above reasons, the Applicant's application for judicial review is granted and the matter is returned for determination anew (
de novo
) by a different member of the Board.
JUDGMENT
[49]
THIS COURT ORDERS that the Applicant's application for judicial review be granted and the matter be returned for determination anew (
de novo
) before another member of the Board with no question of general importance for certification.

[Traduction]: Le demandeur sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision, datée du 18 septembre 2012, par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la Commission] a conclu que le demandeur n'avait ni qualité de réfugié au sens de l'article 96 ni celle de personne à protéger au sens de l'article 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR].
II.
Contexte
[2]
Le demandeur, M. Mehmet Ali Atacan Yurtal, est un citoyen de la Turquie né en 1971. Il est d'origine azerbaïdjanaise et est un chrétien pratiquant depuis plus de dix ans.
[3]
Le demandeur a été élevé dans la province de Kars dans une famille de confession religieuse jafarite chiite.
[4]
En 1997, le demandeur est devenu un membre actif d'un parti politique d'opposition de gauche [le parti Emek Partisi ou l'EMEP] ). Il s'est peu après converti au christianisme, en 2000.
[5]
Au mois d'août 2000, des policiers ont arrêté le demandeur en raison de ses activités religieuses et l'ont battu pendant sa détention.
[6]
Le demandeur déclare que les policiers ont continué à le harceler après cet événement. Il a donc décidé de déménager d'Istanbul à Ankara en avril 2001.
[7]
Le demandeur a indiqué qu'en 2002, après avoir assisté à un office religieux à Ankara, il est tombé dans une embuscade et a été sauvagement battu par un gang de nationalistes extrémistes turcs. Une lettre du Dr Nurullah Zengin, datée du 3 août 2012, confirme que le demandeur a été hospitalisé le 21 juillet 2002 pour des fractures au bras droit et au coude gauche (dossier du demandeur [DD], aux pages 161 et 162).
[8]
En avril 2007, les policiers ont encore une fois arrêté le demandeur, cette fois pour avoir placé une bannière sur un pont à Ankara pour protester contre le meurtre de trois chrétiens dans la ville voisine de Malatya. Il a expliqué qu'il a été détenu pour être interrogé et qu'il a à nouveau été battu et torturé. Une lettre du Dr Nurullah Zengin, datée du 3 août 2012, confirme que le demandeur a été hospitalisé le 27 avril 2007 pour une luxation de l'épaule gauche (DD, aux pages 163 et 164).
[9]
Le demandeur a témoigné qu'il a participé en 2008 à la manifestation du 1er mai avec l'EMEP à Istanbul. Les policiers avaient alors affronté les manifestants avec des véhicules blindés et des boucliers et utilisé des gaz lacrymogènes pour disperser la foule. Les policiers ont arrêté le demandeur, ainsi que d'autres manifestants, et l'ont battu sauvagement.
[10]
En février 2009, le demandeur a commencé à travailler comme marin pour une compagnie internationale de transport maritime. Il a continué à travailler en cette qualité jusqu'en novembre 2010.
[11]
Le demandeur a raconté qu'en septembre 2009, un voisin sunnite s'est plaint à la police du fait qu'il distribuait des dépliants pour son église protestante chrétienne. Les policiers l'ont par la suite interrogé sur ses activités religieuses et politiques et l'ont battu.
[12]
Le demandeur a de nouveau été arrêté en juin 2010 pour distribution de dépliants après de nouvelles plaintes faites aux policiers par les voisins. Les policiers l'ont encore détenu et battu.
[13]
En juillet 2010, après avoir été réembauché par la société de transport maritime, le demandeur a de nouveau quitté la Turquie. En qualité de membre de l'équipage, il a voyagé pendant quatre mois sur un navire de charge, s'arrêtant dans plusieurs pays avant de finalement arriver au Canada, où il a accosté le 17 novembre 2010, à Québec.
[14]
Le 30 novembre 2010, après avoir quitté le navire, laissé les autres membres de l'équipage et abandonné ses fonctions, il s'est rendu en autobus à Toronto. Là, il a présenté une demande d'asile.
[15]
La Commission a entendu sa demande le 2 avril 2012 et le 19 juillet 2012.
III.
La décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle
[16]
Dans sa décision datée du 18 septembre 2012, la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'avait ni qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger. Selon elle, le demandeur n'avait pas une crainte subjective ou objective d'être persécuté pour des motifs religieux ou politiques.
Motifs religieux
[17]
En ce qui a trait à la première allégation de persécution du demandeur, fondée sur des motifs religieux, la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré qu'il craignait d'être persécuté en Turquie. Elle a conclu que les incidents allégués sur lesquels il fondait sa demande étaient isolés et les a qualifiés d'actes commis au hasard s'étalant sur une période de plusieurs années et qui, selon elle, n'étaient ni répétitifs ni continus.
[18]
Lorsqu'elle a évalué l'allégation de persécution du demandeur, la Commission s'est dite d'avis que l'exposé circonstancié du demandeur comportait des irrégularités qui, selon elle, indiquaient une absence de crainte subjective de persécution. Par exemple, même s'il a mentionné qu'il craignait pour sa vie en tant que chrétien dans une collectivité principalement musulmane, la Commission a néanmoins conclu que le demandeur avait pratiqué sa religion pendant près de dix ans, puisqu'il fréquentait une (maison) église régulièrement (où un pasteur venait officier). La Commission a estimé qu'il y avait des contradictions entre la preuve documentaire du demandeur et son témoignage relativement à ses activités religieuses entre 2000 et 2009 (dossier de l'audience du 2 avril 2012, aux pages 16 à 18). (Une lecture attentive montre qu'il peut y avoir eu un malentendu, car le demandeur a précisé qu'il distribuait des dépliants portant sur sa foi chrétienne considérés comme étant de nature missionnaire en 2009, et non en 2000, époque où était simplement un fidèle.)
[19]
Pour statuer sur le bien-fondé de sa crainte subjective, la Commission s'est également penchée sur la raison pour laquelle le demandeur avait tardé à demander l'asile. Elle a conclu que le demandeur avait trop tardé à quitter la Turquie, tout comme il avait trop tardé plus tard à demander l'asile au Canada après avoir quitté son pays. Le demandeur est arrivé au Canada en qualité de marin à Québec le 17 novembre 2010. Il a ensuite pris l'autobus jusqu'à Toronto et a présenté sa demande d'asile le 30 novembre 2010, uniquement après avoir quitté les membres de l'équipage du navire ou avoir été en mesure de les laisser.
[20]
Finalement, la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'avait ni une crainte subjective ni une crainte objective de persécution. Dans ses motifs, la Commission a expressément fait état des sujets de préoccupation susmentionnés et de l'
International Religious Freedom Report 2010
[IRFR, rapport de 2010 sur la liberté de religion dans le monde -Turquie] (dossier certifié du tribunal [DCT], à la page 72), qui indique qu'en 2010, [traduction] « des chrétiens ou des baha'is faisant la promotion de leur religion étaient menacés ou subissaient des pressions de la part de représentants du gouvernement et de l'État », mais que, dans la pratique, le gouvernement
a respecté la liberté de religion
de «
manière générale
. » [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[21]
La Commission a décidé de n'accorder un poids important qu'à certains éléments de preuve documentaire choisis, et a conclu à l'inexistence d'une crainte objective de persécution, par opposition à la crainte de discrimination, sujet abordé plus loin.
Motifs politiques
[22]
Au terme de son analyse, la Commission est parvenue à une conclusion sur l'allégation de persécution du demandeur pour des motifs d'affiliation politique avec l'EMEP: à son avis, la preuve que le demandeur craignait d'être persécuté par la police était insuffisante.
[23]
Selon la Commission, la détention et la torture lors de la manifestation du 1er mai 2008, soit l'incident que le demandeur a soulevé dans son exposé circonstancié concernant ses activités politiques, découlaient de la participation même du demandeur à des manifestations générales et non nécessairement de son association à l'EMEP. La Commission a conclu que rien n'indiquait que les policiers auraient su qu'il était membre du EMEP et, à son avis, la preuve démontrait que le demandeur n'avait pas un profil politique qui le rendait suspect aux yeux des policiers. Selon elle, il était simplement un membre du parti qui n'occupait aucun poste.
[24]
La Commission a conclu qu'il n'était pas vraisemblable que l'événement relaté par le demandeur soit lié à son appartenance à l'EMEP. Ainsi, la crainte d'être persécuté par la police qu'il a fait valoir, qui était fondée sur ses activités politiques, était, selon elle, non fondée.
IV.
Question en litige
[25]
La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en interprétant mal ou ne tenant pas compte de la preuve dans ses conclusions?
V.
Dispositions législatives pertinentes
[26]
Les dispositions législatives pertinentes de la LIPR sont les suivantes:
Définition de « réfugié »
96.

a
) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b
) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
Personne à protéger
97.
(1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:

VI.
Norme de contrôle
[27]
La norme de contrôle applicable aux conclusions de la SPR relatives à la crédibilité et à la crainte subjective est celle du caractère raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47).
[29]
La Cour n'interviendra que si la Commission a fondé sa décision sur « une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou si la décision est rendue sans égard à la preuve » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 886 (CAF)).
VII.
Position des parties
[30]
Essentiellement, le demandeur soutient que la Commission a commis une erreur susceptible de révision en interprétant mal et en ne tenant pas compte de la preuve lors de son appréciation de la crédibilité et de la crainte subjective, plus particulièrement de la preuve documentaire concernant l'appartenance à l'EMEP et à l'église chrétienne et de rapports médicaux à l'appui des incidents allégués impliquant des policiers.
[31]
Le défendeur fait valoir que la Commission a examiné la totalité de la preuve dans ses conclusions sur la crédibilité et la crainte subjective du demandeur.
VIII.
Analyse
[32]
La Commission a estimé que la preuve documentaire sur des points précis concernant l'appartenance du demandeur à l'église chrétienne, l'EMEP ou les rapports médicaux n'avaient pas de valeur probante pour l'appréciation du bien-fondé de la crainte de persécution alléguée par le demandeur.
[33]
En ce qui concerne l'allégation de persécution du demandeur pour des motifs religieux, la Cour estime que la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle le demandeur n'avait pas de crainte subjective de persécution était déraisonnable. La Commission a tiré une inférence négative du fait que le demandeur a pris dix ans pour demander l'asile et qu'il s'était réclamé de nouveau de la protection de la Turquie (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[34]
Même s'il ressort clairement de la jurisprudence que le temps écoulé n'est pas toujours déterminant dans une demande d'asile, il peut constituer un facteur important pour établir une absence de crainte subjective de persécution, si les explications ne montrent pas le contraire. Le demandeur a déclaré qu'il avait perdu plusieurs membres de sa famille et qu'il ne voulait pas quitter le pays même si sa mère s'occupait de son enfant. (La Commission n'a pas adéquatement examiné cette question, car elle ne fait aucun commentaire concluant à ce sujet dans sa décision, si ce n'est que pour inférer une absence de crédibilité.)
[35]
La Cour conclut également que les conclusions de la Commission concernant l'absence de crainte subjective et objective de la part du demandeur étaient insuffisantes si on les lit dans le contexte de l'ensemble de la transcription et de l'exposé circonstancié écrit. En effet, la présente affaire comporte plus d'éléments inconnus que d'éléments connus, car des renseignements clés provenant de réponses potentielles n'ont pas été obtenus en raison de l'absence de questions pertinentes sur le sujet, questions qui avaient besoin d'être posées dans une ambiance propice. Même si l'audience a duré deux jours, des conclusions ont été tirées sur des éléments clés qui n'étaient pas clairs, ce qui permet d'inférer qu'elles n'étaient pas raisonnables.
[36]
Il est écrit dans le rapport IRFR qu'en 2010, les membres des groupes minoritaires religieux ont eux-mêmes signalé qu'ils [traduction] « avaient la liberté de pratiquer leur religion », mais il faut examiner les situations au cas par cas en fonction des faits particuliers et dans le contexte des activités entreprises par les groupes religieux minoritaires. Dans plusieurs régions, des améliorations n'ont pas nécessairement été constatées, comme le précisent les documents objectifs contenant des affirmations contraires présentés par le demandeur.
[37]
Certains rapports indiquent clairement une
persécution de la part de la société
, une variété de mauvais traitements à la fois verbaux et physiques contre des groupes religieux;
selon la preuve documentaire, les incidents visaient tous les groupes religieux minoritaires, pas seulement les chrétiens
. (
La situation s'est-elle améliorée, ou peut-on estimer qu'elle a évolué en ce qui a trait aux droits de la personne, étant donné que les mauvais traitements visent maintenant tous les groupes en général et non un seul groupe
, ce qui démontre qu'il n'y a pas de distinction quant aux cibles parmi l'ensemble des groupes minoritaires? Tous sont par conséquent considérés comme étant de telles cibles.) Le témoignage même du demandeur le confirme (dossier de l'audience du 2 avril 2012, à la page 18).
[38]
À l'appui de son raisonnement, la Commission a indiqué qu'en 2010, même si [traduction] «
[p] lusieurs membres de la population estimaient que le pluralisme religieux constituait une menace pour l'islam et l'"unité nationale"
» [non souligné dans l'original], les groupes minoritaires religieux étaient autorisés, mais de façon
limitée
, à établir de nouvelles fondations communautaires religieuses et à rouvrir les fondations qui avaient été fermées auparavant. Ils pouvaient aussi chercher à obtenir des restitutions ou des indemnités pour les fondations qui avaient été confisquées par les autorités de l'État les dernières décennies. Ces éléments étaient considérés comme étant des améliorations. Toutefois, le dénouement pragmatique ultime n'est pas encore au rendez-vous en ce qui a trait à la protection des libertés religieuses en Turquie et, jusqu'à maintenant, ces améliorations n'indiquent pas l'existence d'un État qui protège les droits. Les mauvais traitements graves et la persécution n'ont pas diminué, comme on le constate à la lecture non sélective de l'ensemble de la preuve documentaire sur la situation du pays. (Il est utile de souligner que les groupes religieux minoritaires non dominants de Turquie représentent moins de 1 p. cent de la population du pays. Voir la pièce
U.S. Department of State Report
[rapport du département d'État des États-Unis] du 17 novembre 2010.)
[39]
Selon les éléments de preuve et les motifs que le demandeur a présentés, les faits de l'espèce semblent effectivement indiquer un échec de la protection de l'État et la possibilité d'une violence systématique fondée sur des motifs religieux et politiques dans le cas du présent demandeur, lorsqu'il pose quelque geste que ce soit en public au lieu de pratiquer sa religion dans la maison-église qu'il fréquentait. On peut également faire le même constat en ce qui a trait à l'allégation de persécution pour des motifs politiques ainsi qu'aux motifs religieux allégués au regard de sa foi protestante chrétienne et de la pratique de cette religion. (Par exemple, voir la preuve objective à ce sujet dans le dossier, soit le rapport intitulé « "A threat" or Under Threat? Legal and Social Problems of Protestants in Turkey », 2010, Association of Protestant Churches Committee for Religious Freedom and Legal Affairs [le comité des affaires juridiques et de la lutte pour la liberté religieuse de l'association des églises protestantes], qui indique que les Églises protestantes demeurent vulnérables en Turquie. Voir aussi la pièce intitulée
Ecumenical Patriarch on Christian Persecution in Turkey
, datée du 23 décembre 2009,www.catholic.org; il est également renvoyé à la pièce «
Religious Freedom Survey
», 2009, concernant des violations graves des droits de la personne.)
[40]
Comme la Cour l'a déclaré dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il est pleinement reconnu que pour que des mauvais traitements soient considérés comme étant de la « persécution », ils doivent répondre à deux critères: ils doivent être
graves
et ils doivent être répétitifs ou systématiques. Le harcèlement ou la discrimination n'est pas en soi suffisant pour être considéré comme de la persécution. De plus, les mauvais traitements doivent être véritablement déterminants quant à la « protection de l'État » (
Canada (Procureur général) c Ward
, [1993] 2 RCS 689, au paragraphe 63). Dans le cas du demandeur, chaque fois qu'il a été détenu par les autorités ou qu'il a été la victime de mauvais traitements de la part de la société, la situation semblait très différente parce qu'elle était grave et que le demandeur était en danger, comme en font foi des éléments de preuve précis non contredits.
[41]
Après avoir examiné l'ensemble de la preuve dans le DCT et les observations des parties, la Cour est convaincue que la Commission a tiré des conclusions erronées en ce qui a trait à la crainte subjective et objective de persécution du demandeur en ne tenant pas compte de certains éléments de preuve, alors qu'elle aurait dû démontrer de façon satisfaisante qu'elle les avait au moins pris en considération pour parvenir à sa décision. En qualité de tribunal et juge des faits spécialisé, la Commission doit tenir compte d'une manière quelconque de la preuve pertinente concernant un demandeur particulier qui présente des éléments de preuve précis et ne pas faire une évaluation générique, vague et hors contexte.
[42]
La Commission a examiné et apprécié de façon insatisfaisante la preuve, tant la preuve personnelle du demandeur que la preuve documentaire. Ainsi, il n'appartient pas à la Cour, mais uniquement au tribunal spécialisé, en tant que juge des faits, de s'assurer que la compétence qui lui est conférée est exercée conformément à son expertise en fonction de la preuve. Les conclusions de la Commission étaient injustifiées en raison du poids qu'elle a accordé aux éléments de preuve en l'absence d'une analyse plus approfondie et plus complète,
ne serait-ce qu'en faisant de brèves observations à leur égard, ou même simplement y renvoyant plus directement, de façon à ne pas écarter des éléments de preuve pertinents présentés dans leur contexte
.
[43]
Il incombe donc à la Commission d'examiner les éléments de preuve objectifs et subjectifs (personnels) du demandeur contenus dans son témoignage et dans les documents, notamment les
cinq arrestations, détentions et incidents de violence non contestés
dont il a personnellement fait l'objet. La Commission, se fondant sur la totalité de la preuve au dossier, n'a rejeté aucun de ces éléments de preuve de façon expresse dans ses motifs. Elle a tout simplement complètement fait abstraction de nombreux éléments de preuve documentaire objectifs sur lesquels le demandeur avait attiré son attention.
[44]
La Commission n'a pas conclu que les effets cumulatifs potentiels des incidents en eux-mêmes manquaient de crédibilité. Le cumul des incidents peut en effet avoir des incidences, ce qui nécessite également une analyse particulière de la part de la Commission. Des éléments de preuve précis de l'église, du parti politique et les rapports médicaux ont été écartés sans que la Commission ne fournisse d'explication satisfaisante. Ces éléments de preuve peuvent dans les faits avoir un tel effet cumulatif, s'ils sont crédibles.
[45]
Le demandeur a expliqué pourquoi il avait tardé à présenter sa demande d'asile. Pour écarter ces explications, la Commission aurait à tout le moins dû également en traiter expressément au regard des réponses du demandeur figurant au dossier.
[46]
En conclusion, le témoignage du demandeur ne peut pas simplement être écarté s'il n'est pas contredit par le Formulaire de renseignements personnels [le FRP] ou s'il ne manque pas de logique inhérente par rapport au FRP.
[47]
La Commission n'est pas tenue de donner de longues explications, mais elle doit traiter de ces questions
. Autrement, on pourrait dire que les motifs de la décision sont inappropriés, car ils ne présentent pas une évaluation adéquate de ce qui semble être des éléments de preuve pertinents.
La Cour répète que le « comment » et le « quoi », lorsqu'ils figurent dans le raisonnement de la Commission, permettent à cette dernière de parvenir à la décision qu'elle doit rendre en tant que tribunal spécialisé. Il appartient au juge des faits spécialisé de faire cette démarche, et il faut à tout le moins traiter des éléments de preuve non contredits
.
IX.
Conclusion
[48]
Pour tous ces motifs, la demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur est accueillie et l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre commissaire pour que celui-ci rende une nouvelle décision.
JUGEMENT
[49]
La cour ordonne que la demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur soit accueillie et que l'affaire soit renvoyée à un autre commissaire pour que celui-ci rende une nouvelle décision; il n'y a aucune question grave de portée générale à certifier.
