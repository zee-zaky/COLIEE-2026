Bédard, J.
[Translation]: The applicant filed an appeal under subsection 14(5) of the
Citizenship Act
, RSC 1985, c C-29 (Act), from a decision dated December 6, 2013, by a citizenship judge (judge) who denied his citizenship application on the ground that he did not meet the residency requirement set out in paragraph 5(1)(
c
) of the Act. For the following reasons, the appeal is dismissed.
I.
Background
[2]
The applicant is originally from Ukraine, but arrived in Canada from Israel on January 25, 2008, as a temporary worker. His spouse and son joined him six months later and they obtained their permanent resident status on May 27, 2010.
[3]
Since 2008, the applicant has been working as a truck driver and his duties include delivering goods in Canadian and American cities. He is therefore regularly asked to go to the United States for short periods of time.
[4]
The applicant filed a citizenship application on May 27, 2012.
[5]
Subsection 5(1) of the Act governs the granting of citizenship and reads as follows:
Grant of citizenship
5. (1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who
(a) makes application for citizenship;
(b) is eighteen years of age or over;
(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, and has,
within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada
calculated in the following manner:
(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and
(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;
(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;
(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; and
(f) is not under a removal order and is not the subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council made pursuant to section 20.
Attribution de la citoyenneté
5. (1) Le ministre attribue la citoyenneté à toute personne qui, à la fois:
a) en fait la demande;
b) est âgée d'au moins dix-huit ans;
c) est un résident permanent au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
et a,
dans les quatre ans qui ont précédé la date de sa demande, résidé au Canada pendant au moins trois ans
en tout, la durée de sa résidence étant calculée de la manière suivante:
(i) un demi-jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada avant son admission à titre de résident permanent,
(ii) un jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada après son admission à titre de résident permanent;
d) a une connaissance suffisante de l'une des langues officielles du Canada;
e) a une connaissance suffisante du Canada et des responsabilités et avantages conférés par la citoyenneté;
f) n'est pas sous le coup d'une mesure de renvoi et n'est pas visée par une déclaration du gouverneur en conseil faite en application de l'article 20.
[6]
Subsection 5(4) of the Act sets out that, in certain circumstances, the Minister has the authority to grant citizenship to an individual even if he or she does not meet the residency requirement:
Special cases
(4) Despite any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, in his or her discretion, grant citizenship to any person to alleviate cases of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada.
Cas particuliers
(4) Malgré les autres dispositions de la présente loi, le ministre a le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'attribuer la citoyenneté à toute personne afin de remédier à une situation particulière et inhabituelle de détresse ou de récompenser des services exceptionnels rendus au Canada.
[7]
The applicant completed the residence questionnaire with the assistance of an accountant who prepared a detailed list of his absences from Canada, which were all related to his work as a truck driver. He declared 423 days of absence.
II.
Impugned decision
[8]
The judge lowered the number of days of absence declared by the applicant. Instead of the 423 days of absence stated in the applicant's residence questionnaire, she found that during the relevant period (between January 25, 2008, and May 27, 2010), he was present in Canada for 810 days and absent for 285 days.
[9]
The judge clearly stated that she was applying the quantitative test for residency developed in
Pourghasemi (Re)
(1993), 62 FTR 122, [1993] FCJ No 232, which requires the applicant's physical presence to determine whether the applicant met the residency requirement. Under that test, the applicant had to therefore demonstrate that he had been present in Canada for at least 1,095 days within the four years immediately preceding his citizenship application. Because the applicant had been present for only 810 days, the judge found that he did not meet the residency requirement.
[10]
She also stated that the applicant did not argue any circumstance that would justify her making a recommendation to the Minister that he be granted citizenship under the discretionary authority set out in subsection 5(4) of the Act.
III.
Analysis
[11]
The applicant raises three main arguments against the decision, which, with respect, cannot be accepted.
[12]
The applicant's first argument is that the judge erred in calculating the number of days he was absent and that, had it not been for that error, she would have probably granted him citizenship.
[13]
The applicant claims that the days during which he was present in Canada for part of the day, namely the days when he was leaving Canada for the United States and the days when he was coming back to Canada from the United States, should have been considered days of presence. To support his position, he relies on subsection 27(3) of the
Interpretation Act
, RSC 1985, c I-21 and argues that the word "time" that is mentioned in that section must be understood in a broad sense, that is, as referring to the period required to accomplish something. Subsection 27(3) reads as follows:
Beginning and ending of prescribed periods
(3) Where a time is expressed to begin or end at, on or with a specified day, or to continue to or until a specified day, the time includes that day.
Début et fin d'un délai
(3) Si le délai doit commencer ou se terminer un jour déterminé ou courir jusqu'à un jour déterminé, ce jour compte.
[14]
According to the calculation method proposed by the applicant, he was not absent from the country for 288 days during the reference period, but only for 70 days.
[15]
First, it is useful to note that the applicant never claimed before the judge that he was absent from Canada only 70 days during the reference period. In his citizenship questionnaire, the applicant declared 423 days of absence. It was the judge herself who pointed out at the hearing that the applicant had claimed too many days of absence. The new calculation method proposed by the applicant was therefore never presented or raised before the judge.
[16]
In any event, I find it unnecessary to determine whether that method has merit because even in adopting the calculation method proposed by the applicant, he does not attain the minimum number of days required to be granted citizenship according to the physical presence test for residency. Based on his calculations, the applicant would end up with 1,025 days of presence whereas he needs 1,095 days to meet the requirement.
[17]
The applicant adds that if the judge had found that he had been absent for only 70 days instead of 285 days during the period examined, she might have applied a residency test that is less strict than the purely quantitative physical presence test. He raises the following passage from the reasons for decision in support of his argument:
When I met with the applicant, I had already reviewed the many documents he had previously submitted. These documents show that, on the balance of probabilities, the applicant has lived in Canada during the relevant period, but not for the required number of days, as outlined in the
Citizenship Act
.
When I explained to him
that he had a significant shortfall
, he seemed surprised and told me that the CIC website said he could apply after three years in Canada. I admitted that this is correct, but he must also have deducted any absences he had.
[Emphasis added.]
[18]
The applicant also states that it is clear from the case law submitted by the respondent that citizenship judges apply the physical presence test in circumstances where the number of days of absence is high.
[19]
With respect, the applicant's argument is speculative at best. First, it is clear that the judge chose to apply the quantitative test for residency. The only inference that I can make from the passage of the decision cited by the applicant is that the judge explained the nature of the physical presence test to the applicant. In that same paragraph, she stated that the applicant was required to subtract his days of absence. Therefore, nothing in her decision suggests that she chose to apply the numerical test for residency based on the applicant's number of days of absence.
[20]
As for the argument regarding the case law, I would like to make two comments. First, that argument was not advanced by the applicant in his memorandum and the respondent was correct in answering that he was unable to respond to it. Second, the applicant did not submit any exhaustive study of decisions of citizenship judges or of this Court to maintain that, generally, the physical presence test is recognized as a reasonable interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(
c
) of the Act only when the applicant's number of days of absence from Canada is high. That argument is not supported by the evidence or the case law submitted.
[21]
The applicant's second argument is that, by choosing to apply the numerical test for residency, the judge applied old case law without considering most of the Court's recent decisions that confirm the well-foundedness of the qualitative test developed in
Koo (Re)
, [1993] 1 FC 286, 59 FTR 27. He referred to
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 248 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) and to judgments of the Court that followed the reasoning of Justice Mainville in that matter. With respect, I do not agree with the applicant and I find that the case law of the Court has remained divided.
[22]
I have stated in at least three decisions (
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1801;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1830 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 1711) that I believe that in the absence of a definition of the term "residence" in the Act, citizenship judges may choose to adopt one of the three tests traditionally recognized in the case law of this Court as being reasonable interpretations of the residency requirement. I expressed that point of view, and continue to adhere to it, despite Justice Mainville's attempt, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, to introduce uniformity into the rulings.
[23]
The Chief Justice himself also shared this same view recently and reiterated that the three tests for residency still constituted reasonable interpretations of the residency requirements set out in the Act in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphs 18, 21-23, [2013] FCJ No 629.
[24]
I therefore find that the judge did not err by choosing to apply the quantitative physical presence test for residency and that she did not err by finding that the applicant was not present in Canada for the minimum number of days required to be granted citizenship.
[25]
The applicant's third argument is that the judge should have considered his special circumstances, namely the fact that all of his absences were for a short period of time and were related to his work as a truck driver, to recommend that the Minister exercise the discretion conferred on him under subsection 5(4) of the Act.
[26]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2014] FCJ No 724, the Court recently addressed the circumstances that could give rise to the application of subsection 5(4) of the Act:
50 The jurisprudence on "special and unusual hardship" under s. 5(4) of the Act is not as well developed as, for example, the jurisprudence on the meaning of hardship under s. 25(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27. While there is no firmly established test for "special and unusual hardship" under s. 5(4) of the Act, in my view, the following remarks by Justice Walsh in
Re Turcan
(T-3202, October 6, 1978, FCTD), as quoted by him in
Naber-Sykes
(Re), [1986] 3 FC 434, 4 FTR 204 [
Naber-Sykes
] remain valid and serve as a good starting point:
The question of what constitutes "special and unusual hardship" is of course a subjective one and Citizenship Judges, Judges of this Court, the Minister, or the Governor in Council might well have differing opinions on it. Certainly the mere fact of not having citizenship or of encountering further delays before it can be acquired is not of itself a matter of "special and unusual hardship", but in cases where as a consequence of this delay families will be broken up, employment lost, professional qualifications and special abilities wasted, and the country deprived of desirable and highly qualified citizens, then, upon the refusal of the application because of the necessarily strict interpretation of the residential requirements of the Act when they cannot be complied with due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, it would seem to be appropriate for the Judge to recommend to the Minister the intervention of the Governor in Council. . . .
51 Thus, it is not purely or even primarily a question of whether the individual in question would make a desirable citizen, or has good reasons (perhaps even, as in the present case, laudable reasons) for not being able to comply with the requirements of the Act strictly read. Rather, the Court has to consider as well whether the effect of applying those requirements strictly and thus denying citizenship would impose some hardship on the applicant or their family beyond the delay in citizenship itself. For example, in
Naber-Sykes
, the applicant, who had lived, studied and worked in Canada for nearly a decade but had only recently become a permanent resident, could not become licensed to practice her profession (law) without citizenship. Justice Walsh found that the citizenship judge had failed to properly consider the hardship this would impose.
[27]
In this case, nothing in the evidence suggests that the applicant's situation corresponds to circumstances that give rise to the application of the discretionary authority set out in subsection 5(4) of the Act and the judge did not err in finding that there were no circumstances that justified her making a recommendation that the Minister grant the applicant citizenship under that section.
[28]
For all of these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  logé un appel en vertu de l'article 14(5) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, LRC 1985, c C-29 [la Loi], d'une décision rendue le 6 décembre 2013 par une juge de la citoyenneté (la juge) qui a rejeté sa demande de citoyenneté au motif qu'il n'avait pas satisfait au critère de résidence énoncé à l'alinéa 5(1)
c
) de la Loi. Pour les motifs qui suivent, l'appel est rejeté.
I. Contexte
[2]
Le demandeur est originaire de l'Ukraine, mais il est arrivé au Canada en provenance d'Israël le 25 janvier 2008 à titre de travailleur temporaire. Son épouse et son fils sont venus le rejoindre six mois plus tard et ils ont obtenu leur statut de résidents permanents le 27 mai 2010.
[3]
Depuis 2008, le demandeur travaille comme chauffeur de camion et, dans le cadre de ses fonctions, il livre des marchandises dans des villes canadiennes et américaines. Il est donc régulièrement appelé à se rendre aux États-Unis pour de courtes périodes.
[4]
Le demandeur a déposé une demande de citoyenneté le 27 mai 2012.
[5]
Le paragraphe 5(1) de la Loi gouverne l'attribution de la citoyenneté et se lit comme suit:
Attribution de la citoyenneté
5. (1) Le ministre attribue la citoyenneté à toute personne qui, à la fois:
a) en fait la demande;
b) est âgée d'au moins dix-huit ans;
c) est un résident permanent au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
et a,
dans les quatre ans qui ont précédé la date de sa demande, résidé au Canada pendant au moins trois ans
en tout, la durée de sa résidence étant calculée de la manière suivante:
(i) un demi-jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada avant son admission à titre de résident permanent,
(ii) un jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada après son admission à titre de résident permanent;
d) a une connaissance suffisante de l'une des langues officielles du Canada;
e) a une connaissance suffisante du Canada et des responsabilités et avantages conférés par la citoyenneté;
f) n'est pas sous le coup d'une mesure de renvoi et n'est pas visée par une déclaration du gouverneur en conseil faite en application de l'article 20.
Grant of citizenship
5. (1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who
(a) makes application for citizenship;
(b) is eighteen years of age or over;
(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, and has,
within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada
calculated in the following manner:
(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and
(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;
(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;
(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; and
(f) is not under a removal order and is not the subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council made pursuant to section 20.
[6]
Le paragraphe 5(4) de la Loi prévoit que dans certaines circonstances, le Ministre a le pouvoir d'attribuer la citoyenneté à une personne même si elle ne satisfait pas au critère de la résidence:
Cas particuliers
(4) Malgré les autres dispositions de la présente loi, le ministre a le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'attribuer la citoyenneté à toute personne afin de remédier à une situation particulière et inhabituelle de détresse ou de récompenser des services exceptionnels rendus au Canada.
Special cases
(4) Despite any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, in his or her discretion, grant citizenship to any person to alleviate cases of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada.
[7]
Le demandeur a rempli le questionnaire sur la résidence avec l'aide d'une comptable qui a préparé une liste détaillée de ses absences du Canada, lesquelles sont toutes liées à son travail de camionneur. Il a déclaré 423 jours d'absence.
II. Décision contestée
[8]
La juge a revu à la baisse le nombre de jours d'absence déclaré par le demandeur. Au lieu des 423 jours d'absence indiqués dans le questionnaire sur la résidence du demandeur, elle a conclu qu'au cours de la période visée (entre le 25 janvier 2008 et le 27 mai 2010), il avait été présent au Canada pendant 810 jours et absent pendant 285 jours.
[9]
La juge a clairement indiqué qu'elle retenait le critère quantitatif de résidence élaboré dans
Pourghasemi (Re)
(1993), 62 FTR 122, [1993] ACF no 232 qui requiert la présence physique du demandeur pour déterminer s'il a satisfait à l'obligation de résidence. En vertu de ce critère, le demandeur devait donc démontrer qu'il avait été présent au Canada au moins 1095 jours au cours des quatre années précédant sa demande de citoyenneté. Or, comme le demandeur n'avait été présent que pour 810 jours, la juge a conclu qu'il n'avait pas satisfait au critère de résidence.
[10]
Elle a aussi indiqué que le demandeur n'avait fait valoir aucune circonstance qui justifierait qu'elle recommande au ministre que la citoyenneté lui soit attribuée en vertu du pouvoir discrétionnaire prévu au paragraphe 5(4) de la Loi.
III. Analyse
[11]
Le demandeur invoque trois principaux arguments à l'encontre de la décision qui, avec égard, ne peuvent être retenus.
[12]
Comme premier argument, le demandeur soutient que la juge a erré dans le calcul de son nombre de jours d'absence et que n'eut été de cette erreur, elle lui aurait probablement attribué la citoyenneté.
[13]
Le demandeur prétend que les jours au cours desquels il a été présent au Canada pour une partie de la journée, notamment les jours où il sortait du Canada pour se rendre aux États-Unis et les jours où il rentrait au Canada en provenance des États-Unis, auraient du être considérés comme des jours de présence. Il appuie sa position sur le paragraphe 27(3) de la
Loi d'interprétation
, LRC 1985, c I-21 et invoque que le mot « délai » mentionné dans ce paragraphe doit s'entendre au sens large, soit comme référant à la période donnée pour accomplir quelque chose. Le paragraphe 27(3) se lit comme suit:
Début et fin d'un délai
(3) Si le délai doit commencer ou se terminer un jour déterminé ou courir jusqu'à un jour déterminé, ce jour compte.
Beginning and ending of prescribed periods
(3) Where a time is expressed to begin or end at, on or with a specified day, or to continue to or until a specified day, the time includes that day.
[14]
Selon la méthode de calcul proposée par le demandeur, il n'a pas été absent du pays 288 jours au cours de la période de référence, mais seulement 70 jours.
[15]
D'abord, il est utile de noter que le demandeur n'a jamais prétendu devant la juge qu'il n'avait été absent du Canada que 70 jours durant la période de référence. Dans son questionnaire sur la citoyenneté, le demandeur a déclaré 423 jours d'absence. C'est la juge elle-même qui a soulevé à l'audience le fait que le demandeur s'était attribué un nombre trop élevé de jours d'absence. La nouvelle méthode de calcul que propose le demandeur n'a donc jamais été présentée ni invoquée devant la juge.
[16]
À tout événement, je considère qu'il n'est pas nécessaire que je détermine si cette méthode a du mérite puisque même en adoptant la méthode de calcul proposée par le demandeur, il n'atteint pas le nombre minimal de jours requis pour se voir attribuer la citoyenneté sur la base du critère de résidence fondé sur la présence physique. Selon ses calculs, le demandeur se retrouverait avec 1025 jours de présence alors qu'il a besoin de 1095 jours pour satisfaire au critère.
[17]
Le demandeur ajoute que si la juge avait considéré qu'il n'avait été absent que 70 durant la période examinée au lieu de 285 jours, elle aurait possiblement appliqué un critère de résidence moins strict que celui purement quantitatif de la présence physique. Il invoque le passage suivant des motifs de la décision en appui à son argument:
When I met with the applicant, I had already reviewed the many documents he had previously submitted. These documents show that, on the balance of probabilities, the applicant has lived in Canada during the relevant period, but not for the required number of days, as outlined in the
Citizenship Act
.
When I explained to him
that he had a significant shortfall
, he seemed surprised and told me that the CIC website said he could apply after three years in Canada. I admitted that this is correct, but he must also have deducted any absences he had.
[Je souligne]
[18]
Le demandeur affirme également qu'il ressort de la jurisprudence soumise par le défendeur que les juges de la citoyenneté appliquent le critère de la présence physique dans des circonstances où le nombre de jours d'absence est élevé.
[19]
Avec égard, l'argument du demandeur est pour le moins spéculatif. D'une part, il est clair que la juge a choisi d'appliquer le critère quantitatif de résidence. La seule inférence que je peux tirer du passage de la décision cité par le demandeur, c'est que la juge a expliqué au demandeur en quoi consistait le critère de la présence physique. Dans ce même paragraphe, elle a indiqué que le demandeur devait soustraire ses jours d'absence. Rien dans sa décision ne laisse donc sous-entendre que son choix d'appliquer le critère quantitatif de résidence était motivé par le nombre de jours d'absence du demandeur.
[20]
Quant à l'argument relatif à la jurisprudence, je tiens à faire deux commentaires. D'abord, cet argument n'avait pas été avancé par le demandeur dans son mémoire et le défendeur était bien fondé de répondre qu'il n'était pas en mesure d'y répondre. D'autre part, le demandeur n'a présenté aucune étude exhaustive des décisions des juges de la citoyenneté ou de notre Cour pour soutenir que, de façon générale, le critère de la présence physique est reconnu comme une interprétation raisonnable de l'alinéa 5(1)
c
) de la Loi uniquement lorsque les demandeurs ont été absents du Canada pour un nombre élevé de jours. Cette proposition n'est aucunement appuyée par la preuve ou la jurisprudence déposée.
[21]
Comme deuxième argument, le demandeur soutient qu'en choisissant d'appliquer le critère quantitatif de résidence, la juge a appliqué une jurisprudence ancienne sans considérer la majorité des décisions récentes de la Cour qui confirment le bien-fondé du critère qualitatif élaboré dans l'affaire
Koo (Re)
, [1993] 1 CF 286, 59 FTR 27. Il a renvoyé à l'affaire
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 248 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] et à des jugements de la Cour qui ont suivi le raisonnement élaboré par le juge Mainville dans cette affaire. Avec égard, je ne partage pas l'opinion du demandeur et je considère que la jurisprudence de la Cour demeure partagée.
[22]
J'ai énoncé dans au moins trois jugements (
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF no 1801;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1830 et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 1711 que j'estimais qu'en l'absence d'une définition du terme « résidence » dans la Loi, les juges de la citoyenneté pouvaient choisir d'adopter l'un des trois critères traditionnellement reconnus par la jurisprudence de notre Cour comme étant des interprétations raisonnables du critère de résidence. J'ai exprimé ce point de vue, et continue d'y adhérer, malgré la tentative du juge Mainville dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, d'uniformiser la jurisprudence.
[23]
Le juge en chef a lui aussi émis ce même point de vue récemment et réitéré que les trois critères de résidence constituaient toujours des interprétations raisonnables des conditions relatives à la résidence prévues à la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paras 18, 21-23, [2013] ACF no 629.
[24]
Je considère donc que la juge n'a pas commis d'erreur en choisissant d'appliquer le critère de résidence quantitatif fondé sur la présence physique et qu'elle n'a pas erré en concluant que le demandeur n'avait pas été présent au Canada le nombre minimal de jours requis pour se voir attribuer la citoyenneté.
[25]
Le demandeur invoque comme troisième argument que la juge aurait dû tenir compte de ses circonstances particulières, et notamment du fait que toutes ses absences ont été de courte durée et étaient liées à son travail de camionneur, pour recommander au ministre d'exercer la discrétion conférée au paragraphe 5(4) de la Loi.
[26]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2014] FCJ No 724, la Cour a récemment traité des circonstances pouvant donner ouverture à l'application du paragraphe 5(4) de la Loi:
50 La jurisprudence se rapportant à la « situation particulière et inhabituelle de détresse » au titre du paragraphe 5(4) de la Loi n'est pas aussi bien établie par exemple que celle qui concerne les difficultés au sens du paragraphe 25(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27. Bien qu'il n'existe aucun critère fermement établi relatif aux « situation[s] particulière[s] et inhabituelle[s] de détresse » au titre du paragraphe 5(4) de la Loi, les observations suivantes du juge Walsh dans la décision
Re Turcan
(T-3202, 6 octobre 1978, CFPI), qu'il a reproduites dans la décision
Naber-Sykes (Re)
, [1986] 3 CF 434, 4 FTR 204 (
Naber-Sykes
) demeurent valides et sont un bon point de départ:
Naturellement, l'appréciation de ce qui constitue « une situation particulière et exceptionnelle de détresse » est une appréciation subjective et il se peut que cette appréciation soit différente selon qu'elle émane des juges de la citoyenneté, des juges de la Cour de céans, du Ministre ou du gouverneur en conseil. Certes, le simple fait de ne pas avoir la citoyenneté canadienne ou d'avoir à attendre plus longtemps avant de l'acquérir n'est pas en soi une situation « particulière et exceptionnelle de détresse », mais dans les cas où ce retard entraîne la séparation des familles, la perte d'un emploi, l'inutilisation de compétences professionnelles et de talents spéciaux et où le Canada est privé de citoyens désirables et hautement qualifiés, il semble qu'après avoir rejeté la demande par suite d'une interprétation nécessairement stricte et des conditions de résidence prévues par la Loi, lesquelles n'ont pu être remplies pour des raisons indépendantes de la volonté du requérant, le juge doit recommander au ministre de faire intervenir le gouverneur en conseil [...]
51 Ainsi, il ne s'agit pas strictement ni même principalement de décider si la personne en question ferait un bon citoyen, ou si de bonnes raisons (peut-être même, comme dans le cas présent, des raisons louables) l'empêchent de se conformer aux exigences de la Loi, interprétées strictement. La Cour doit plutôt se demander aussi si les conséquences d'une application stricte de ces exigences, et donc le refus de la citoyenneté, imposeraient au demandeur ou à sa famille des difficultés allant au-delà de l'octroi tardif de la citoyenneté elle-même. Par exemple, dans l'affaire
Naber-Sykes
, la demanderesse, qui avait vécu, étudié et travaillé au Canada pendant près de dix ans, mais qui n'était que récemment devenue résidente permanente, ne pouvait obtenir sa licence pour pratiquer sa profession (d'avocate) sans la citoyenneté. Le juge Walsh a conclu que le juge de la citoyenneté n'avait pas dûment examiné les difficultés que cela impliquait.
[27]
En l'espèce, rien dans la preuve qui permet de penser que la situation du demandeur correspond aux circonstances donnant ouverture à l'application du pouvoir discrétionnaire prévu au paragraphe 5(4) de la Loi et la juge n'a pas erré en concluant qu'aucune circonstance ne justifiait qu'elle recommande au ministre que la citoyenneté soit attribuée au demandeur en vertu de ce paragraphe.
[28]
Pour tous ces motifs, l'appel est rejeté.
