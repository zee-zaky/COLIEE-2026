Martineau, J.
: This is an application for judicial review under section 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the
IRPA
) of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (the Appeal Division) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) dated June 21, 2004 wherein the Appeal Division determined that the appeal filed by the applicant should be discontinued based on a lack of jurisdiction.
[2]
Sahila Alleg, the applicant is a Canadian citizen. She is married to Khelil Hamida (the sponsoree). The sponsoree was born in Algeria on May 21, 1970. On April 30, 1995, the sponsoree came to Canada with a false French passport. On May 3, 1995, the sponsoree made a refugee claim. On March 18, 1998, the IRB found the sponsoree not to be a refugee within the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
, 1951, 189 U.N.T.S. 137 (the Convention) definition, being excluded under paragraph 1F(a) as a person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes. The sponsoree made an application for leave and for judicial review. On June 11, 1998, this Court denied leave for judicial review since the sponsoree did not file a record.
[3]
On January 30, 1999, the applicant married the sponsoree. On September 15, 1999, the applicant submitted an application to sponsor the sponsoree. On September 20, 1999, the sponsoree made a request for a visa exemption under humanitarian and compassionate grounds and an application for pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). On April 25, 2001, a PRRA officer concluded that the sponsoree would not face persecution, torture or risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon his return in Algeria. On May 7, 2001, an Immigration Officer allowed the sponsoree's request for visa exemption. Consequently, the said request was thereafter treated as a sponsoree application for permanent residence within Canada. On the same day, the IRB found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the sponsoree is a person who has committed an offence referred to in any of sections 4 to 7 of the
Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 24 (the
CAHWC Act
). Consequently, the IRB rejected the sponsored application for permanent residence within Canada since he was found to be inadmissible to Canada under paragraph 19(1)(j) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (the former
Act
).
[4]
On May 7, 2002, the applicant filed a notice of appeal to the Appeal Division of the IRB pursuant to subsection 77(3) of the former
Act
. The
IRPA
came into force on June 28, 2002. On May 6, 2004, the respondent filed a motion before the Appeal Division seeking the discontinuance of the applicant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the basis of section 196 of the
IRPA
, a transitional provision which purports to discontinue certain appeals to the Appeal Division that were made before the
IRPA
came into force. More precisely, the respondent filed a notice of discontinuance on the basis that the applicant (then appellant) was the sponsor of a foreign national, the sponsoree, who had been refused on security grounds as defined in subsection 320(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (the
Regulations
).
[5]
The hearing of May 10, 2004 was adjourned for a period of three weeks to permit written submissions concerning section 196 of the
IRPA
. However, the applicant's counsel did not submit any written submissions regarding section 196 of the
IRPA
. On June 21, 2004, the Appeal Division agreed with the respondent that the appeal should be discontinued for lack of jurisdiction. The Appeal Division held that from the language of section 196, the statutory scheme of the
IRPA
, the object of Parliament enacting the
IRPA
and section 196 in particular, it is evident that section 196 is applicable to sponsorship appeals and that it constitutes an exception to section 192 of the
IRPA
.
[6]
The specific issue in this judicial review is whether sponsorship appeals for permanent residence status are subject to section 196 of the
IRPA
and whether, as a result, such appeals are discontinued when the sponsoree cannot be admitted on security grounds and the applicant has not been granted a stay. More particularly, the Court is asked to determine whether section 196 of the
IRPA
apply only to appeals made under subsections 70(1) or (2) of the former
Act
or whether it also include appeals made by sponsors under subsection 7(3) of the former
Act
.
[7]
The applicant relies on
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 252 F.T.R. 267; 2004 FC 660, to affirm that the Appeal Division's decision to discontinue the applicant's appeal was made in error. Moreover, the applicant argues that, where vested rights are at stake, a tribunal is obliged to use the interpretation of the law which is most favourable to the person concerned. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Chief Justice Lutfy decided that section 196 did not apply to sponsorship appeals. In coming to this conclusion, the Chief Justice noted that a sponsor could never be granted a discretionary stay. In his view, this suggested that Parliament only intended to remove the right of appeal for "removal order appellants" under section 70 of the former
Act
.
[8]
On the other hand, the Respondent contests this proposition and relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 254 F.T.R. 224; 2004 FC 662,
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2004 FC 1236, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  three recent decisions on this Court which have questioned <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, to say that the Appeal Division did not err in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the applicant's appeal.
[9]
There is no dispute that, using the functional and pragmatic approach, the standard of review applicable to the impugned decision regarding the interpretation of section 196 of the
IRPA
is correctness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra;
Kang
, supra). I also adopt the standard of statutory interpretation proposed in Elmer A. Driedger,
Construction of Statutes
, (1983), 2nd ed., Toronto, Butterworths, which has been adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1; 154 D.L.R.(4th) 193, at paragraph 21 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 27) and consistently applied by the Federal Court of Appeal as well as this Court:
"Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the intention of Parliament."
[10]
The present application should be dismissed. For the reasons mentioned in the following paragraphs, I find that section 196 of the
IRPA
apply to both appeals made under subsections 70(1) or (2) of the former
Act
and appeals made by sponsors under subsection 77(3) of the former
Act
. It is useful to note that the relevant sections of the
IRPA
, the
Regulations
, as well as the former
Act
, are reproduced in annex.
[11]
I have carefully considered the competing views regarding the proper interpretation of section 196 articulated by Phelan J. and Gauthier, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, on the one hand, and by Lutfy, C.J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, on the other. In this regard, I am in agreement with the following analysis made by Mactavish, J., in
Kang
, supra, at paragraphs 25 to 30:
"As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in enacting
IRPA
, Parliament re-balanced the interests of public safety and individual rights by broadening the categories of persons who may be removed without an appeal to the IAD. To this end, section 64 is designed to limit the opportunities for admission to Canada for those involved in serious criminality, human rights violations or activities giving rise to national security concerns.
"In other words, section 64 is intended to assist in ensuring the safety of Canadians and the security of Canadian society: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras. 51 and 52. The section ensures that prospective immigrants who are not admissible for any of the reasons identified in sub-section 64(1) cannot do indirectly what they are not entitled to do directly: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 34.
"As Justice Phelan noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the close linkage of sections 196 and 64 suggests that section 196 is also intended to serve these objectives, and to limit the right to continue appeals under the new legislation.
"This view of section 196 is borne out by the decision of Justice Pelletier in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . While he was dissenting on other grounds, he was clearly of the view that section 196 applied to sponsorship appeals: see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras. 88-91.
"In coming to the conclusion that section 196 did not apply in the case of sponsorship appeals in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Chief Justice Lutfy found it significant that sponsors could never be granted a discretionary stay. In his view, this suggested that Parliament only intended to remove the right of appeal for 'removal order appellants' under section 70 of the former
Immigration Act
.
"In this regard, I prefer the reasoning of Justice Gauthier  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where she found that the exclusion of appellants who have been granted a stay from the application of section 196 was done out of deference to the IAD. In her view, it did not follow that an appellant had to have the right to seek a stay in order to escape the reach of section 196. I agree."
[12]
Like Mactavish, J., in
Kang
, supra, I am satisfied that the interpretation of section 196 articulated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, properly reflects Parliament's intent in enacting this provision. I am also satisfied that the present application can be determined on examining the plain meaning of the words in section 196 of the
IRPA
. The appellant falls squarely into the conditions which must be met in order that an appeal be discontinued.
[13]
Section 196 of the
IRPA
must be considered in its context and within the overall scheme of the legislation (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), leave to appeal granted (2004), 334 N.R. 190 (S.C.C.). Section 190 requires that existing proceedings under the former
Act
be conducted under the
IRPA
. Section 192 of the
IRPA
continues any appeal filed under the former
Act
. However, there are two exceptions which can be found in sections 196 and 197 of the
IRPA
. Both sections begin with "Despite section 192", which I conclude to mean "in spite of" or "notwithstanding". In addition, both provisions refer in particular to section 64 of the
IRPA
. In my opinion, the restrictions of the appellant's right to appeal under section 64 of the
IRPA
is the prime qualifier in section 196. Section 64 of the
IRPA
refers specifically to "sponsors". Consequently sections 196 and 197 of the
IRPA
were intended to affect the rights of appellants who are sponsors, such as the applicant, notwithstanding the continuation concept found at section 192 of the
IRPA
. The natural consequence of this legislative scheme is that existing rights may be affected, even adversely.
[14]
It is trite law that it is permissible for the Parliament to deny the right to appeal (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 142 N.R. 173 (F.C.A.)). In the event that Parliament had intended that vested rights were to be preserved notwithstanding the new legislation, it could simply have said so. Moreover, it is consistent and logical that Parliament would not want sponsors to enjoy greater benefits than those available to sponsoree applicants for landed status. The benefits of landed status can well long survive beyond the relationship which gave rise to the sponsorship. Parliament was simply ensuring that which cannot be done directly cannot be accomplished indirectly. It is clear that section 64 of the
IRPA
, while referring to sponsors and permanent residents, is not directed primarily at the objective of family unification. In fact, section 64 of the
IRPA
is designed to limit the opportunity for admission to Canada by those which have been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality. That objective is to be attained whether the inadmissible persons appeal directly themselves of by means of a sponsor. Section 64 of the
IRPA
is focussed primarily, if not exclusively, on the objective of safety of Canadians and the security of Canadian society. By linking section 64 and section 196 so closely, I conclude that section 196 is also intended to serve that objective.
[15]
Consequently, I find that the applicant's argument regarding the exclusion of sponsorship appeals from the application of section 196 would not respect the intention of the Parliament and give full effect to the words used by the Parliament in the said provision.
[16]
The applicant has proposed the following question for certification:
Does section 196 of the
IRPA
apply only to appeals made under section 70(1) or (2) of the former
Act
or does it include appeals made by sponsors under section 77 of the former
Act
?
[17]
For the reasons already mentioned and with all due respect for the contrary view expressed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, I have already answered the question and found in this regard that section 196 of the
IRPA
clearly applies to sponsorship appeals and that the Appeal Division's decision is correct. That said, I am not satisfied that the proposed question is of general importance. I note, in this regard, that Gauthier, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, precisely refused to certify an almost identical question while Mactavish, J., in
Kang
, supra, declined to certify any question relating to the same issue basically because the transitional provisions in the
IRPA
apply to a limited number of cases.
ORDER
[18]
THIS COURT ORDERS that the present application for judicial review be dismissed.
Application dismissed.

a) à l'égard duquel il a été décidé, en application de l'alinéa 40.1(4)d), que l'attestation visée au paragraphe 40.1(1) est raisonnable;
b) qui appartient à l'une des catégories non admissibles visées aux alinéas 19(1)c), c.1), c.2) ou d) et, selon le ministre, constitue un danger pour le public au Canada.
(3.1) Dans le cas où une province, aux termes d'un accord conclu en vertu de l'article 108, exerce seule la responsabilité de la fixation et de l'application des normes financières relatives aux demandes d'engagement, le répondant ne peut en appeler, en invoquant un des moyens prévus à l'alinéa (3)a), du refus de l'agent d'immigration ou de l'agent des visas d'octroyer le droit d'établissement à un parent en raison du rejet par le fonctionnaire provincial compétent de sa demande d'engagement, au motif soit qu'il ne satisfait pas aux normes financières de la province où il réside, soit qu'il a manqué à un engagement antérieur, si la législation de la province accorde un droit d'appel au répondant du rejet de sa demande d'engagement.
(3.2) Dans le cadre de l'appel prévu au paragraphe (3):
a) le ministre peut présenter à la Section de première instance de la Cour fédérale, à huis clos et en l'absence de l'intéressé et du conseiller le représentant, une demande en vue d'empêcher la communication à l'intéressé de renseignements obtenus sous le sceau du secret auprès du gouvernement d'un État étranger, d'une organisation internationale mise sur pied par des États étrangers ou l'un de leurs organismes;
b) la Section de première instance de la Cour fédérale, à huis clos et en l'absence de l'intéressé et du conseiller le représentant:
(i) étudie les renseignements,
(ii) accorde au représentant du ministre la possibilité de présenter ses arguments sur le fait que les renseignements ne devraient pas être communiqués à l'intéressé parce que cette communication porterait atteinte à la sécurité nationale ou à celle de personnes;
c) ces renseignements doivent être remis au représentant du ministre et ne peuvent servir de fondement à la décision de la section d'appel sur l'appel si la Section de première instance de la Cour fédérale détermine que leur communication à l'intéressé ne porterait pas atteinte à la sécurité nationale ou à celle de personnes;
d) si la Section de première instance de la Cour fédérale décide que cette communication porterait atteinte à la sécurité nationale ou à celle de personnes, les renseignements ne sont pas communiqués mais peuvent servir de fondement à la décision de la section d'appel sur l'appel.
(3.3) La demande visée à l'alinéa (3.2)a) a pour effet de suspendre l'appel jusqu'à ce que la Section de première instance de la Cour fédérale rende une décision à son égard.
(4) La section d'appel peut faire droit à l'appel visé au paragraphe (3) ou le rejeter. Elle fait part de sa décision et de ses motifs au ministre et à l'appelant.
(5) Une fois avisé qu'il a été fait droit à l'appel, le ministre, sous réserve du paragraphe (6), fait poursuivre l'examen de la demande par un agent d'immigration ou un agent des visas. Celui-ci approuve la demande s'il est établi que le répondant et le parent satisfont aux exigences de la présente loi et de ses règlements, autres que celles sur lesquelles la section d'appel a rendu sa décision.
(6) La présentation d'une demande d'autorisation relative à la présentation d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire par le ministre de la décision de la section d'appel a pour effet de suspendre l'application du paragraphe (5) jusqu'au jugement sur la demande d'autorisation et, dans le cas où celle-ci est accueillie, jusqu'au jugement sur la demande de contrôle judiciaire ou jusqu'à la décision en appel de ce jugement ou à l'expiration du délai normal d'appel, selon le cas.
