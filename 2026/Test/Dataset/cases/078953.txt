[1]
Pinard, J.
: On January 27, 2012, Pathmanathan Nagamuthu (the "applicant"), a citizen of Sri Lanka, filed the present application for judicial review of the decision of L. Ly, an immigration officer with Citizenship and Immigration Canada (the "officer"), pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the "Act"). The officer denied the applicant's permanent residency application on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in docket IMM-862-12 and also denied his pre-removal risk assessment ("PRRA") in docket IMM-863-12 on the same day.
[2]
The applicant was born in Sri Lanka in 1952. He is a Tamil from the northern region of the country. The applicant arrived in Canada on March 12, 1995. A removal order was issued against the applicant on March 20, 1995.
[3]
The applicant claimed refugee status, but his claim was denied on September 23, 1996 and leave for judicial review was denied on February 19, 1997.
[4]
The applicant's application for permanent residence from within Canada based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was received by Citizenship and Immigration Canada on September 29, 2005.
[5]
The applicant claims to be established in Canada, having a job, going to temple and speaking English, while he sends money to his family back in Sri Lanka. The applicant contends that it is in the best interest of his children that he remain in Canada, for he sends his two children money back in Sri Lanka in order for them to pursue their studies. His children are in their twenties. His wife also remains in Sri Lanka.
[6]
Due to the unfavorable conditions in Sri Lanka, if forced to return, the applicant claims that he would be at risk, being believed to be a supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ("LTTE"). Since the end of the war, his family has had problems with the Karuna, a paramilitary group. He also claims to be at risk in Sri Lanka for having filed a failed refugee claim here in Canada. He also fears the Sri Lankan authorities and the paramilitary, being elderly and thereby vulnerable to persecution.
[7]
In November 2010, the applicant filed his PRRA, which was refused by the officer on December 2, 2011, as was his application for permanent residency based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. While the decisions are dated December 2, 2011, they were only served on the applicant on January 17, 2012.
[8]
On December 14, 2011, applicant's counsel submitted additional documentary evidence on the country conditions in Sri Lanka. By correspondence dated the same day, the applicant was sent a call-in-notice informing him that a decision had been made and he had to attend an interview on January 17, 2012. At the January 2012 interview, the applicant was told that both of his applications were denied.
* * * * * * * *
[9]
The issues raised by the present applications for judicial review can be summarized as follows:
i. Did the officer err in law in her PRRA assessment, failing to apply the correct legal standard?
ii. Did the officer err in law in her PRRA assessment, failing to consider the cumulative persecution faced by the applicant?
iii. Did the PRRA officer err by failing to conduct an analysis under paragraph 97(1)(a) of the Act?
iv. Did the officer fail to provide sufficient reasons in her decision to reject the applicant's application for permanent residency?
v. Did the officer err, making factual determinations in a perverse or capricious manner, without regard to the evidence before her?
* * * * * * * *
I.
Did the officer err in law in her PRRA assessment, failing to apply the correct legal standard?
Applicant's arguments
[10]
The applicant contends that the officer failed to apply the correct legal standard in her PRRA assessment. The applicant argues that he did not have the burden of proving based on a balance of probabilities that he would face persecution, contrary to the officer's assertion. The applicant submits that the officer had to determine whether the applicant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution pursuant to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). Rather, the officer used shifting burdens of proof in different parts of her decision.
Respondent's arguments
[11]
The respondent asserts that the burden of proof is that of a balance of probabilities, the applicant having to prove the existence of a subjective fear which is objectively well-founded based on a balance of probabilities, as set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. Then, the decision-maker must consider whether the applicant met his burden of proof, specifically, whether there is a serious possibility of risk or persecution. The respondent argues that a reading of the officer's PRRA decision indicates that she applied the proper test. The respondent submits that when the officer states that "on a balance of probabilities" the applicant did not prove he was an LTTE supporter, she is simply making findings of fact and not setting out the applicable legal test. Thereby, the respondent asserts that the officer cannot be faulted for addressing each of the allegations made by the applicant in his PRRA.
Analysis
[12]
In my opinion, the officer did not apply an incorrect legal standard. The respondent correctly summarized the situation: the officer did not fail to apply the proper legal test in evaluating the applicant's PRRA application. Rather, the burden of proof rested on the applicant to establish that he faced a serious possibility of persecution ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 5; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 120;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at para 29 [
Li
] ). The officer clearly applied the correct legal test, concluding that:
Ainsi, à la lumière de l'ensemble du dossier, je considère que le demandeur ne s'est pas déchargé du fardeau de sa preuve qu'il court un des risques prévus aux articles 96 et 97 de la Loi advenant un retour au Sri Lanka. Le demandeur n'a pas démontré qu'il y aurait
plus qu'une simple possibilité
qu'il soit persécuté au Sri Lanka ni qu'il a des motifs sérieux de croire qu'il serait personnellement exposé au risque d'être soumis à la torture, à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou de peine cruels et inusités. [Emphasis added.]
[13]
The references made by the officer to a balance of probabilities relate to her assessment of the evidence adduced by the applicant and not her identification of the legal test the applicant had to meet. The officer did not err in law.
II.
Did the officer err in law in her PRRA assessment, failing to consider the cumulative persecution faced by the applicant?
Applicant's argument
[14]
The applicant goes on to argue that the officer erred in her PRRA assessment, failing to consider that the individual incidents of discrimination considered cumulatively amount to persecution. In her decision based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, the officer made numerous findings as to risks the applicant may face upon his return, such as having to register with the police, face questioning or proceed through security checkpoints. These findings are not mentioned in the officer's PRRA assessment. However, the applicant asserts that these findings should have been included and that the officer should have determined whether they cumulatively amounted to persecution, as the documentary evidence indicated discriminatory treatment of Tamils from the north.
[15]
The applicant submits that since the officer erred in her PRRA assessment, she also did so in her decision based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Thereby, the applicant argues that both applications for judicial review should be allowed.
Respondent's arguments
[16]
The respondent argues that while the applicant claims the officer failed to assess the incidents of discrimination cumulatively, the officer clearly stated in her decision based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds that she considered all of the factors individually and cumulatively, addressing each risk and fear raised by the applicant. The respondent submits that the officer then concluded that cumulatively, these factors and the evidence did not indicate that he would face disproportionate hardship or anything other than the generalized risks faced by the rest of the Sri Lankan population.
[17]
The respondent asserts that the officer explained why cumulatively there was no persecution: the applicant was considered not to be credible by the Immigration and Refugee Board in his refugee claim based on the same allegations of persecution.
[18]
Furthermore, the respondent argues that the present case can be distinguished from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], which is relied on by the applicant: here, the officer made no positive findings as to the alleged risks, finding there was little reason to believe the applicant would be detained or harassed.
Analysis
[19]
The cases relied on by the applicant as to the notion of cumulative persecution can be distinguished from the case at hand. While it has been recognized that multiple incidents of discrimination can constitute persecution pursuant to section 96 of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), there are no such recognized incidents of discrimination in the present case. Unlike  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the applicant did not suffer any previous or subsequent harassment and there is no evidence that he would likely endure such treatment. Therefore, while a failure to address the cumulative nature of persecution has been considered an error of law (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above), in the case at hand there were no multiple incidents of harassment that the officer had to consider: cumulative persecution was therefore not an issue.
[20]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above Justice John O'Keefe did recognize that an officer's failure to consider cumulative persecution in a PRRA application amounted to an error in law. However, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the officer had concluded in the applicant's application based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds that the applicant "may have to register with police and may be questioned by state security agencies if he wishes to reside in Colombo, or, if he resides in Jaffna, the applicant might be required to proceed through security checkpoints and register with the police" (at para 25). These findings were not mentioned in the officer's PRRA decision rendered the same day and thereby, this Court held that the officer had failed to consider whether these discriminatory acts cumulatively amounted to more than a mere possibility of persecution ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 26).
[21]
However, in the present case, the officer made no such findings of fact as to possible discriminatory treatment the applicant may face upon returning to Sri Lanka. The officer concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant would face any of the alleged mistreatment, the documentary evidence not being indicative of treatment faced by individuals similarly situated. Thus, considering there was no evidence that the applicant would be subject to discriminatory treatment, the officer had no obligation to consider whether multiple incidents of discrimination would amount to persecution.
III.
Did the PRRA officer err by failing to conduct an analysis under paragraph 97(1)(
a
) of the Act?
[22]
The applicant argues that the PRRA officer erred by failing to conduct an analysis under paragraph 97(1)(
a
). The applicant submits that he faces the risk of torture by the state or agents of the state upon return to Sri Lanka, including the Karuna group and the Eelam People's Democratic Party, because those groups would believe he was a supporter of the LTTE.
[23]
In the decision, the officer analyzed the risk that paramilitary groups pose to the applicant. The officer found that the applicant had not demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that he would be suspected upon return to Sri Lanka of being a sympathizer of the LTTE.
[24]
The officer also analyzed whether paramilitary groups or the state authorities pose a risk to the applicant for other reasons. The officer found that the applicant had not demonstrated he is a person whose profile would be of interest to the paramilitary groups or the state authorities.
[25]
The officer concluded the analysis with a boiler-plate statement regarding how the applicant has failed to prove he is subject to any of the risks provided for in sections 96 and 97 of the Act. The officer did not analyze whether the applicant met the criteria for paragraph 97(1)(
a
) specifically.
[26]
Paragraph 97(1)(
a
) requires an applicant to prove it is more likely than not he or she will personally be subjected to a danger of torture upon return to their country of nationality (
Li
, above at para 29).
[27]
The applicant alleges he is facing the risk of torture in Sri Lanka due to being perceived as an LTTE sympathizer, but the officer found the applicant would not be suspected of being associated with the LTTE. I do not believe that in this context it was incumbent on the officer to undertake a paragraph 97(1)(
a
) analysis. Therefore, I disagree with the applicant that the PRRA officer erred by failing to conduct an analysis under paragraph 97(1)(
a
).
IV.
Did the officer fail to provide sufficient reasons in her decision to reject the applicant's application for permanent residency?
[28]
The applicant argues that the officer's reasons are inadequate. The applicant contends that while the officer concludes that individually, the factors raised by the applicant's application do not amount to unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship, she does not explain why collectively these factors do not meet the required threshold of hardship, merely stating that collectively they are insufficient. I do not agree.
[29]
The reasons provided by the officer are sufficient and this Court's intervention is not warranted on this basis. In both decisions, the officer explained why she rejected the applicant's applications: she addressed each of the factors raised by the applicant. The officer considered each factor, but concluded that there was a lack of evidence to establish that the applicant would suffer unusual, underserved or disproportionate hardship. Therefore, the reasons given by the officer are sufficient: they enable the applicant to understand why his application was rejected.
[30]
In this case, it is clear that the officer did not merely summarize the factors, but weighed each of them based on the evidence before her. While the applicant may disagree with the officer's weighing of the evidence, her reasons are clear and this Court cannot intervene on this basis.
V.
Did the officer err, making factual determinations in a perverse or capricious manner, without regard to the evidence before her?
[31]
The officer's assessment of the evidence was reasonable and the applicant has failed to establish that the officer ignored the evidence before her. While the officer did not specifically address the evidence of the economic conditions in Sri Lanka, this alone does not render the decision unreasonable. Rather, the officer considered there was insufficient evidence as to the specific economic consequences the applicant's return to Sri Lanka would have on him and his family; there was no evidence to support the applicant's allegations. Moreover, as explained by the respondent, the applicant did not explain why he would be unable to find work or start up a new business, based on his experience.
[32]
Furthermore, the officer did not ignore the evidence outlining the difficulties encountered by Tamils, failed refugee claimants or individuals without National Identification Cards. The officer noted these facts outlined in the documentary evidence, but concluded that the applicant would face a generalized risk. The documentary evidence indicates that those likely subject to scrutiny by the Sri Lankan authorities are returning citizens with outstanding warrants, criminal records or known associations to the LTTE, or without identification. These individuals will however not necessarily be arrested and no Sri Lankan without a National Identification Card has been arrested since 2009 according to the evidence relied on by the applicant. Moreover, there is no evidence that failed refugee claimants have had any problems upon their return once they have successfully entered the country.
[33]
Therefore, the officer clearly did not ignore the evidence identified by the applicant. Rather, having evaluated the documentary evidence, she concluded that there was no evidence that the applicant would specifically be at risk or face unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. Considerable deference is owed to the officer's factual determinations, including her weighing of the evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 182 at para 19;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47).
* * * * * * * *
[34]
Therefore, for the above-mentioned reasons, the application for judicial review in each case, namely IMM-862-12 and IMM-863-12, is dismissed.
[35]
I agree with counsel for the parties that this is not a matter for certification.
JUDGMENT
[36]
The application for judicial review of the decision of L. Ly, an immigration officer with Citizenship and Immigration Canada, rendered on December 2, 2011, in which the officer denied the applicant's pre-removal risk assessment, is dismissed.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  janvier 2012, Pathmanathan Nagamuthu (le demandeur), un citoyen du Sri Lanka, a déposé la présente demande sollicitant le contrôle judiciaire de la décision de L. Ly, une agente d'immigration à Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (l'agente), en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi). L'agente a rejeté la demande de résidence permanente du demandeur fondée sur des motifs humanitaires dans le dossier IMM-862-12 et, le même jour, elle a aussi rejeté la demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR) dans le dossier IMM-863-12.
[2]
Le demandeur est né au Sri Lanka en 1952. Il est un Tamoul du Nord du pays. Il est arrivé au Canada le 12 mars 1995. Une mesure de renvoi a été prononcée contre lui le 20 mars 1995.
[3]
Le demandeur a présenté une demande d'asile, mais celle-ci a été rejetée le 23 septembre 1996 et l'autorisation de présenter un contrôle judiciaire lui a été refusée le 19 février 1997.
[4]
Le 29 septembre 2005, Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada a reçu la demande de résidence permanente du demandeur depuis le Canada fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire.
[5]
Le demandeur allègue être établi au Canada, avoir un emploi, aller au temple et parler anglais, tandis qu'il envoie de l'argent à sa famille qui est demeurée au Sri Lanka. Il soutient qu'il est dans l'intérêt supérieur de ses enfants qu'il demeure au Canada, car il envoie de l'argent à ses deux enfants au Sri Lanka afin que ceux-ci puissent poursuivre leurs études. Ses enfants sont dans la vingtaine. Son épouse demeure également au Sri Lanka.
[6]
En raison des conditions défavorables au Sri Lanka, le demandeur allègue que s'il était forcé d'y retourner, il serait exposé à des risques, car on le croirait être un partisan des Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (TLET). Depuis la fin de la guerre, sa famille a connu des problèmes avec le Karuna, un groupe paramilitaire. Il allègue aussi être exposé à des risques au Sri Lanka parce qu'il a présenté une demande d'asile au Canada. Il craint également les autorités sri-lankaises et les paramilitaires, car il est âgé et par conséquent, vulnérable à la persécution.
[7]
En novembre 2010, le demandeur a présenté sa demande d'ERAR, laquelle a été rejetée par l'agente le 2 décembre 2011, tout comme sa demande de résidence permanente fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. Bien que les décisions soient datées du 2 décembre 2011, elles n'ont été signifiées au demandeur que le 17 janvier 2012.
[8]
Le 14 décembre 2011, le conseil du demandeur a présenté des éléments de preuve documentaire supplémentaires sur la situation du pays au Sri Lanka. Dans une lettre datée du même jour, un avis de convocation a été envoyé au demandeur l'informant qu'une décision avait été prise et qu'il devait se présenter à une entrevue le 17 janvier 2012. Lors de l'entrevue de janvier 2012, le demandeur a appris que ses deux demandes étaient rejetées.
* * * * * * * *
[9]
Les questions soulevées par les présentes demandes de contrôle judiciaire peuvent être résumées comme suit:
i. L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur de droit dans l'ERAR, en n'appliquant pas la bonne norme juridique?
ii. L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur de droit dans l'ERAR, en ne tenant pas compte de la persécution cumulative à laquelle le demandeur était exposé?
iii. L'agente chargée de l'ERAR a-t-elle commis une erreur en ne se livrant pas à une analyse fondée sur l'alinéa 97(1)
a
) de la Loi?
iv. L'agente a-t-elle omis de motiver suffisamment sa décision de rejeter la demande de résidence permanente du demandeur?
v. L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur en tirant des conclusions factuelles d'une manière abusive ou arbitraire ou sans égard à la preuve dont elle disposait?
* * * * * * * *
I.
L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur de droit dans l'ERAR, en n'appliquant pas la bonne norme juridique?
Arguments du demandeur
[10]
Le demandeur soutient que l'agente n'a pas appliqué la bonne norme juridique dans son ERAR. Il fait valoir qu'il ne lui incombait pas de prouver, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il serait exposé à de la persécution, contrairement à l'affirmation de l'agente. Le défendeur prétend que l'agente devait se prononcer sur la question de savoir si le demandeur serait exposé a plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution conformément à
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF). L'agente a plutôt déplacé les fardeaux de preuve dans différentes parties de sa décision.
Arguments du défendeur
[11]
Le défendeur fait valoir que le fardeau de preuve est établi selon la prépondérance des probabilités, ce qui signifie que le demandeur doit prouver l'existence d'une crainte subjective qui est objectivement bien fondée selon la prépondérance des probabilités, comme l'énonce l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité. Le décideur doit ensuite se demander si le demandeur s'est acquitté de son fardeau, plus précisément il doit chercher à savoir s'il existe une possibilité sérieuse de risque ou de persécution. Le défendeur soutient qu'une lecture de la décision que l'agente a rendue à la suite de l'ERAR indique qu'elle a appliqué le critère pertinent. Le défendeur fait valoir que lorsque l'agente déclare que« selon la prépondérance des probabilités » le demandeur n'a pas prouvé qu'il était un partisan des TLET, elle tire simplement des conclusions de fait et n'énonce pas le critère juridique applicable. Par conséquent, selon le défendeur, on ne peut reprocher à l'agente d'avoir traité chacune des allégations formulées par le demandeur dans sa demande d'ERAR.
Analyse
[12]
À mon avis, l'agente n'a pas appliqué une mauvaise norme juridique. Le défendeur a résumé la situation avec justesse: l'agente n'a pas omis d'appliquer le bon critère juridique en évaluant la demande d'ERAR du demandeur. Il incombait plutôt au demandeur d'établir qu'il était exposé à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 5; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 120;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), au paragraphe 29 [
Li
] ). L'agente a clairement appliqué le bon critère juridique, concluant comme suit:
Ainsi, à la lumière de l'ensemble du dossier, je considère que le demandeur ne s'est pas déchargé du fardeau de sa preuve qu'il court un des risques prévus aux articles 96 et 97 de la Loi advenant un retour au Sri Lanka. Le demandeur n'a pas démontré qu'il y aurait
plus qu'une simple possibilité
qu'il soit persécuté au Sri Lanka ni qu'il a des motifs sérieux de croire qu'il serait personnellement exposé au risque d'être soumis à la torture, à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou de peine cruels et inusités. [Non souligné dans l'original. En français dans la version anglaise.]
[13]
Le fait pour l'agente de mentionner la prépondérance des probabilités renvoie à son appréciation des éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur et non à l'identification du critère juridique auquel devait répondre le demandeur. L'agente n'a pas commis d'erreur de droit.
II.
L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur de droit dans l'ERAR, en ne tenant pas compte de la persécution cumulative à laquelle était exposé le demandeur?
Arguments du demandeur
[14]
Le demandeur soutient également que l'agente a commis une erreur dans l'ERAR, en ne tenant pas compte du fait que les incidents individuels de discrimination pris de façon cumulative équivalent à de la persécution. Dans sa décision relative à la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, l'agente a tiré de nombreuses conclusions quant aux risques auxquels le demandeur pouvait être exposé à son retour, comme devoir s'enregistrer auprès de la police, être interrogé ou passer par des points de contrôle. Ces conclusions ne sont pas mentionnées dans la décision de l'agente rendue à la suite de son ERAR. Le demandeur fait toutefois valoir que ces conclusions auraient dû être incluses et que l'agente aurait pu se prononcer sur la question de savoir si, de façon cumulative, elles équivalaient à de la persécution, puisque la preuve documentaire indiquait que les Tamouls du Nord faisaient l'objet d'un traitement discriminatoire.
[15]
Le demandeur soutient que puisque l'agente a commis une erreur dans l'ERAR, elle a également commis une erreur dans sa décision relative à la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. C'est pourquoi le demandeur prétend que les deux demandes de contrôle judiciaire devraient être accueillies.
Arguments du défendeur
[16]
Le défendeur soutient que bien que le demandeur allègue que l'agente n'a pas évalué les incidents de discrimination de façon cumulative, celle-ci a clairement déclaré dans sa décision relative à la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire qu'elle avait pris en compte tous les facteurs de façon individuelle et cumulative, traitant chaque risque et crainte soulevés par le demandeur. Selon le défendeur, l'agente a ensuite conclu que, de façon cumulative, ces facteurs et la preuve n'indiquaient pas qu'il serait exposé à des difficultés excessives ou à autre chose que les risques généralisés auxquels était exposé le reste de la population sri-lankaise.
[17]
Le défendeur fait valoir que l'agente a expliqué la raison pour laquelle, sur une base cumulative, il n'y avait pas de persécution: la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié estimait que le demandeur n'était pas crédible dans sa demande d'asile fondée sur les mêmes allégations de persécution.
[18]
De plus, le défendeur soutient qu'une distinction peut être établie entre la présente affaire et la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], sur laquelle s'appuie le demandeur: en l'espèce, l'agente n'a tiré aucune conclusion favorable quant aux risques allégués, concluant qu'il y avait peu de motifs de croire que le demandeur serait détenu ou harcelé.
Analyse
[19]
Une distinction peut être établie entre les jugements sur lesquels s'appuie le défendeur et la présente affaire. Bien qu'il ait été reconnu que des incidents multiples peuvent équivaloir à de la persécution en vertu de l'article 96 de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), il n'y a aucun incident reconnu de discrimination en l'espèce. Contrairement à
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], le demandeur n'a fait l'objet d'aucun acte de harcèlement antérieur ou ultérieur et aucun élément de preuve n'indique qu'il subirait vraisemblablement un tel traitement. En conséquence, bien que l'omission de traiter de la nature cumulative de la persécution ait été considérée comme une erreur de droit (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité), il n'y avait pas en l'espèce d'incidents multiples d'actes de harcèlement dont l'agente devait tenir compte: la persécution cumulative n'était donc pas en cause.
[20]
Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, le juge John O'Keefe a en effet reconnu que l'omission d'un agent de tenir compte de la persécution cumulative dans une demande d'ERAR constituait une erreur de droit. Toutefois, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'agent avait, relativement à la demande du demandeur fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, conclu que celui-ci « pourrait devoir s'enregistrer auprès de la police et être interrogé par les agences de sécurité de l'État s'il désirait élire domicile à Colombo, ou devoir passer par des points de contrôle et s'enregistrer auprès de la police s'il désirait s'établir à Jaffna » (au paragraphe 25). Ces conclusions n'étaient pas mentionnées dans la décision que l'agent a prise le même jour à la suite de son ERAR et par conséquent, la Cour a conclu que l'agent n'avait pas examiné la question de savoir si ces actes discriminatoires constituaient plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 26).
[21]
En l'espèce toutefois, l'agente n'a tiré aucune telle conclusion de fait quant à la possibilité de traitement discriminatoire auquel le demandeur pourrait être exposé à son retour au Sri Lanka. L'agente a conclu que la preuve était insuffisante pour indiquer que le demandeur serait exposé à l'un des mauvais traitements allégués, la preuve documentaire n'indiquant pas le traitement dont faisait l'objet des personnes se trouvant dans une situation semblable. En conséquence, estimant qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve selon laquelle le demandeur ferait l'objet d'un traitement discriminatoire, l'agente n'était pas tenue d'examiner la question de savoir si des incidents multiples pouvaient équivaloir à de la persécution.
III.
L'agente d'ERAR a-t-elle commis une erreur en ne se livrant pas à une analyse fondée sur l'alinéa 97(1)a) de la Loi?
[22]
Le demandeur soutient que l'agente chargée de l'ERAR a commis une erreur en ne se livrant pas à une analyse fondée sur l'alinéa 97(1)
a
). Il prétend qu'il est exposé à des risques de torture aux mains de l'État ou d'agents de l'État à son retour au Sri Lanka, notamment le groupe Karuna et le Parti démocratique du peuple de l'Eelam, parce que ces groupes croiraient qu'il était un partisan des TLET.
[23]
Dans sa décision, l'agente a analysé les risques que présentent les groupes paramilitaires pour le demandeur. Elle a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré selon la prépondérance des probabilités qu'il serait soupçonné d'être un partisan des TLET à son retour au Sri Lanka.
[24]
L'agente a également analysé la question de savoir si les groupes paramilitaires ou les autorités de l'État constituaient un risque pour le demandeur pour d'autres raisons. Elle a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré qu'il était une personne dont le profil intéresserait les groupes paramilitaires ou les autorités de l'État.
[25]
L'agente a conclu l'analyse avec une déclaration type sur la façon dont le demandeur n'avait pas établi qu'il était visé par les risques prévus aux articles 96 et 97 de la Loi. Elle n'a pas analysé la question de savoir si le demandeur répondait aux critères précis prévus à l'alinéa 97(1)
a
).
[26]
Selon l'alinéa 97(1)
a
), le demandeur doit prouver que, selon toute vraisemblance, il sera soumis à un danger de torture à son retour dans son pays de nationalité (
Li
, précité, au paragraphe 29).
[27]
Le demandeur allègue qu'il est exposé à un risque de torture au Sri Lanka parce qu'il est perçu comme étant un partisan des TLET. L'agente a toutefois conclu que le demandeur ne serait pas soupçonné d'être associé aux TLET. Dans ce contexte, je ne crois pas qu'il incombait à l'agente de se livrer à analyse fondée sur l'alinéa 97(1)

IV.
L'agente a-t-elle omis de motiver suffisamment sa décision de rejeter la demande de résidence permanente du demandeur?
[28]
Le demandeur soutient que les motifs de l'agente sont insuffisants. À son avis, malgré que l'agente conclue qu'individuellement, les facteurs soulevés dans la demande du demandeur n'équivalent pas à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives, elle n'explique pas la raison pour laquelle, collectivement, ces facteurs ne répondent pas aux critères applicables aux difficultés, déclarant simplement que collectivement ils sont insuffisants. Je ne suis pas d'accord.
[29]
Les motifs que l'agente a fournis sont suffisants et l'intervention de la Cour n'est pas justifiée sur ce fondement. Dans les deux décisions, l'agente a expliqué les raisons pour lesquelles elle a rejeté les demandes du demandeur: elle a abordé chacun des facteurs soulevés par le demandeur. L'agente a examiné chaque facteur, mais a conclu que la preuve était insuffisante pour établir que le demandeur subirait des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives. Par conséquent, les motifs fournis par l'agente sont suffisants: ils permettent au demandeur de comprendre la raison pour laquelle sa demande a été rejetée.
[30]
En l'espèce, il ressort clairement que l'agente n'a pas simplement résumé les facteurs, mais qu'elle a soupesé chacun d'eux en fonction de la preuve dont elle disposait. Bien que le demandeur puisse ne pas être d'accord avec le poids que l'agente a accordé aux éléments de preuve, les motifs de cette dernière sont clairs et la Cour ne peut pas intervenir sur ce fondement.
V.
L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur en tirant des conclusions factuelles d'une manière abusive ou arbitraire ou sans égard à la preuve dont elle disposait?
[31]
L'agente a apprécié la preuve de façon raisonnable et le demandeur n'a pas établi qu'elle avait ignoré la preuve dont elle disposait. Bien que l'agente n'ait pas précisément abordé la preuve relative à la situation économique au Sri Lanka, cet élément à lui seul ne rend pas la décision déraisonnable. L'agente a plutôt estimé que la preuve relative aux conséquences économiques du retour du demandeur au Sri Lanka pour lui et sa famille était insuffisante. Aucune preuve n'appuyait les allégations du demandeur. De plus, comme l'a expliqué le défendeur, le demandeur n'a pas expliqué les raisons pour lesquelles il ne serait pas en mesure de trouver du travail ou de démarrer une nouvelle entreprise, compte tenu de son expérience.
[32]
En outre, l'agente n'a pas ignoré la preuve décrivant les difficultés auxquelles sont exposés les Tamouls, les demandeurs d'asile déboutés ou les personnes sans carte d'identité nationale. L'agente a mentionné ces faits décrits dans la preuve documentaire, mais a conclu que le demandeur serait exposé à un risque généralisé. Selon la preuve documentaire, les personnes que les autorités sri-lankaises surveillent vraisemblablement sont les citoyens qui retournent et qui font l'objet de mandats non exécutés, qui ont des casiers judiciaires ou des liens connus aux TLET, ou qui n'ont pas de documents d'identité. Ces personnes ne seront pas cependant nécessairement arrêtées et aucun Sri-lankais non muni d'une carte d'identité nationale n'a été arrêté depuis 2009, selon la preuve sur laquelle s'appuie le demandeur. De plus, aucune preuve n'indique que des demandeurs d'asile déboutés ont connu des problèmes à leur retour lorsqu'ils réussissent à rentrer dans leur pays.
[33]
En conséquence, l'agente n'a clairement pas ignoré les éléments de preuves identifiés par le demandeur. Après avoir apprécié la preuve documentaire, elle a plutôt conclu qu'aucun élément de preuve n'indique que le demandeur serait précisément exposé à des risques ou à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives. Les conclusions factuelles de l'agente, y compris son appréciation de la preuve, commandent une déférence considérable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 182;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47).

En conséquence, pour les motifs susmentionnés, la demande de contrôle judiciaire relative à chaque affaire, à savoir les dossiers IMM-862-12 et IMM-863-12, est rejetée.
[35]
Je suis d'accord avec les conseils des parties pour dire qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier.
JUGEMENT
[36]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision du le 2 décembre 2011 par laquelle L. Ly, agente d'immigration à Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada, a rejeté la demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi, est rejetée.
