Richard, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board on September 30, 1994, vacating the decision of a visa officer that the applicants were Convention refugees.
[2]
The applicants, a husband, wife and child, are citizens of Afghanistan. In April 1989, they applied for permanent residence to a visa officer in Islamabad, Pakistan under the family name of Safi. On April 18, 1989, the applicants were determined to be refugees by the visa officer and were permitted to come to Canada on immigrant visas. The applicants arrived in Canada in September 1989. On April 11, 1990, the adult applicants signed statutory declarations admitting that they had entered Canada under false identities and that their true identities and dates of birth were different from those provided to the visa officer. On December 2, 1992, the respondent requested leave of the Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board to make an application to vacate the visa officer's decision that the applicants were refugees. This request was granted on February 17, 1993, and the respondent was informed on May 21, 1993. On September 14, 1993, the respondent filed its application, pursuant to s. 69.2(2) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, to have the visa officer's decision vacated. The hearing into the respondent's application took place on January 5, February 7, and April 18, 1994.
[3]
At the hearings, counsel for the applicants conceded to the misrepresentation and the application of s. 69.2(2), but argued that s. 69.3(5) should apply. Part of counsel's submissions included the position that the Refugee Division's reconsideration of the applicants' claim should be based on additional evidence of persecution and country conditions which existed at the time of the visa officer's decision but which may or may not have been before the officer.
[4]
The relevant provisions of the
Immigration Act
provide as follows:
"69.2(2) The Minister may, with leave of the Chairperson, make application to the Refugee Division to reconsider and vacate any determination made under this Act or the regulations that a person is a Convention refugee on the ground that the determination was obtained by fraudulent means or misrepresentation, suppression or concealment of any material fact, whether exercised or made by that person.
"69.3(5) The Refugee Division may reject an application under s. 69.2(2) that is otherwise established if it is of the opinion that, notwithstanding that the determination was obtained by fraudulent means or misrepresentations, suppression or concealment of a material fact, there was other sufficient evidence in which the determination was or could have been based."
[5]
The majority of the panel (applications to vacate are heard by three members, not two) [see footnote 1] determined that the language in s. 69.3(5) clearly indicates that the panel should only consider the remaining evidence that was before the visa officer after the misrepresented evidence is deleted. The majority stated the issue before them as follows:
"what we must determine is not whether or not the respondents faced reasonable chance of persecution in Afghanistan in 1989, but whether or not there was other sufficient evidence before the visa officer in Pakistan in April 1989 to determine the respondents to be Convention refugees notwithstanding the misrepresentation. In other words, the question is whether the visa officer could have determined the respondents to be Convention refugees in April 1989 had the respondents' true identities been known."
The majority determined that the only uncontradicted evidence remaining before the visa officer was the applicants' nationality and that the panel could not speculate on what other documentary information might have been before the visa officer. On this basis, the majority concluded that there was no remaining evidence before the visa officer which would have led to a positive determination, vacated the determination of the visa officer and found the applicants not to be Convention refugees.
[6]
In dissenting reasons, the remaining member found that the language in s. 69.3(5) was ambiguous and that, in the case of an application to vacate a visa officer's decision, the provision should be interpreted broadly to include the evidence which existed at the time of the visa officer's decision and upon which the determination could have been made. On this basis, the member would have allowed counsel for the applicants to file additional evidence. The member concluded that applicants' delay of five months in informing the authorities of their true identities did not undermine the details of the applicants' true story and that there was other sufficient evidence on which the visa officer could have determined the applicants to be refugees.
[7]
In my view, the majority decision of the Refugee Division properly found that the only uncontradicted evidence that remained before the visa officer after the deletion of the misrepresented evidence would have been the applicants' nationality. Further, the majority reasonably determined that the language of s. 69.3(5) clearly relates only to the evidence that was actually before the visa officer in making the decision, that the Refugee Division ought not speculate as to what documentary evidence might have been available to the visa officer. The majority decision engaged in the analysis mandated by Mr. Justice Gibson in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), and declined to exercise the discretion provided in s. 69.3(5) to reject the application to vacate the visa officer's decision. There is no basis for the intervention of this court with respect to the substance of the Refugee Division's decision to vacate the visa officer's decision.
[8]
However, I am concerned with the emphasised part of the majority's conclusion, which reads as follows:
"In conclusion, I find that the respondents fall within the purview of s. 69.2(2) of the
Immigration Act
, and therefore allow the application of the Minister to vacate the determination of the visa officer that Mohammad Farhad Bayat, also known as Mohammad Zulmai Safi, Shakila Bayat, also known as Shakila Safi, and Marwa Bayat, also known as Marwa Safi, and
find them not to be Conventions refugees
." (emphasis mine)
In my view, on an application by the Minister pursuant to s. 69.2(2) to vacate a previous decision determining the applicants to be Convention refugees, the Refugee Division does not have the jurisdiction to find the applicants not to be Convention refugees, particularly if the decision being vacated is that of a visa officer rendered abroad. Subsection 69.3(4) of the
Act
provides the alternative before the Refugee Division upon an application pursuant to s. 69.2(2):
"69.3(4) The Refugee Division shall approve or reject the application and shall render its decision as soon as possible after completion of the hearing and send a written notice of the decision of to the Minister and the person who is the subject of the application."
Thus, on an application pursuant to s. 69.2(2) the Refugee Division has two alternatives: either to approve or to reject the application to vacate the earlier decision. The language of the provision is clear, the Refugee Division does not have the jurisdiction to find the applicants not to be Convention refugees. In my view, this is particularly so when the decision involved is that of a visa officer abroad, since the applicants in such an instance would not have had the opportunity of a full hearing on the merits of their claim before the Refugee Division.
[9]
At the hearing before me, the respondent argued that the Refugee Division's finding that the applicants were not Convention refugees acted as a bar to the applicant making a subsequent claim for Convention refugee status. I am concerned with this argument since, in this instance, the Refugee Division's decision did in fact result in a determination by a senior immigration officer such that the applicants are now ineligible to make a claim for Convention refugee status in Canada pursuant to s. 46.01(1) of the
Act
. The decision of the senior immigration officer was not part of the application or the record before me and I can only speculate, which I will not do, as to the basis for the officer's decision. However, the decision of the senior immigration officer is currently the subject of an application for leave to file an application for judicial review in this court, and, insofar as the senior immigration officer's decision is based on that part of the Refugee Division's decision which purported to find the applicants not to be Convention refugees, that application may be moot.
[10]
In addition, I have considered Mr. Justice Muldoon's statement in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), that "[t]he effect of vacating of a determination is to annul it from the time of vacation such that the applicant is NOT a Convention refugee." In that case the applicant was a member of an inadmissible class under s. 19(1)(c.1)(i) of the
Act
and, pursuant to s. 46.01(1)(e)(i) of the
Act
, the applicant was not eligible to have a refugee claim determined by the Refugee Division. Mr. Justice Muldoon concluded "that once a refugee determination has been vacated under s. 69.2(2) of the
Act
, the applicant does not have another opportunity to claim refugee status." In my view, this latter statement is predicated on the facts in that case regarding the applicant's criminal inadmissibility and in no way limits the ability of the applicants in this instance to now make the argument before the senior immigration officer that they are eligible to make a claim for Convention refugee status from within Canada since the finding of the Refugee Division that they are not Convention refugees has been struck.
[11]
Counsel for the applicants and the respondent were in agreement that the following question should be certified (I have modified it somewhat to make the question clearer):
Does the Refugee Division have the jurisdiction pursuant to an application pursuant to s. 69.2(2) of the
Immigration Act
to determine that a person is not a Convention refugee on the basis that this jurisdiction is implied in the granting of an application to vacate?
[12]
Accordingly, the application for judicial review is dismissed with respect to that portion of the Refugee Division's decision vacating the visa officer's decision and allowed with respect to the finding that applicants are not Convention refugees. Specifically, the Refugee Division's decision is upheld in its entirety, except that the phrase "and find them not to be Conventions refugees" in the reasons and the phrase "the Refugee Division determines that the claimants ARE NOT CONVENTION REFUGEES" in the decision are declared invalid. Also, pursuant to s. 82.2 of the
Act
, the question set out above is certified.
Order accordingly.
