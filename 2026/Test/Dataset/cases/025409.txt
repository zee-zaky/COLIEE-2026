Strayer, J.
: Mrs. Khat's application for citizenship was rejected by a citizenship judge on the grounds that she had not demonstrated an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship as required by s. 5(1)(e) of the
Citizenship Act
.
[2]
Mrs. Khat is of Cambodian origin. She fled that country under difficulties, her first husband having been killed there. She remarried and has come to Canada with her husband and four children. She was granted landed immigrant status here on September 4, 1985.
[3]
When she appeared before me with her husband as interpreter she was unable to demonstrate an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. Because of the unfortunate circumstance - which is all too common in these cases - of having a close relative act as interpreter, I could not be satisfied that many of the answers given by Mrs. Khat, even when they were correct, were of a spontaneous origin with her.
[4]
Her representative strongly urged that I should make a recommendation to the Minister to exercise his discretion under s. 5(3)(a) of the
Act
to waive the requirement of such knowledge in s. 5(1)(e) on compassionate grounds. The compassionate ground pressed was that Mrs. Khat cannot acquire a better knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship because she is illiterate in Cambodian as well as in both official languages in Canada. She has made serious efforts to learn English since coming to Canada but has made only moderate progress. This is her second unsuccessful application for citizenship.
[5]
There has been some division of opinion in this court concerning the jurisdiction of the court to make such recommendations. I respectfully agree with those judges who have found that the court has no such jurisdiction. (See e.g.,
Re Akins
(1978), 87 D.L.R.(3d) 93;
Re Boutros
, [1980] 1 F.C. 624; and
Re Aaron
, [1982] 2 F.C. 348) The appeal to this court which is authorized under subs. 14(5) is an appeal "from the decision of the citizenship judge under subs. (2) ...", and the decision referred to in that subsection is a decision of the judge to approve or not approve the application. The power given to a citizenship judge in s. 15(1) with respect to the exercise of discretion on compassionate grounds is that of making a recommendation to the Minister in this respect. This is not a "decision" under s. 14(2).
[6]
Section 14(2) provides, however, that as a precondition to making a decision under the subsection, the citizenship judge must consider whether or not to make a recommendation under s. 15(1). While it is not for this court, sitting on appeal, to review the conclusion of the citizenship judge as to whether a recommendation should be made, in a proper case it may be open to this court to refer the matter back to the citizenship judge if this court is not satisfied that relevant factors have been taken into account in the exercise of that discretion. That appears to be the rationale for the decision by my colleague Rouleau, J., in
Re Hanne H. Hokayem
(September 19, 1990, F.C.T.D. File T-583-90, 37 F.T.R. 49). In that case he referred the matter back to the citizenship judge and "urged" that judge to consider certain factors outlined in the reasons of Rouleau, J. Similarly in this case I have ordered that the matter be referred back to the citizenship judge for reconsideration as to whether the discretion under s. 15(1) should have been exercised in favour of the appellant before making the decision under s. 14(2), having particular regard to the applicant's apparent lack of ability to become literate in an official language of Canada. Because the exercise of that discretion is uniquely a matter for the citizenship judge, it is of course for her to satisfy herself from the evidence as to the inability referred to, and for her to determine whether such a factor warrants a recommendation on compassionate grounds.
[7]
I am taking this step because it is not apparent from the reasons for the citizenship judge's decision given to the appellant, nor from those given to the Minister, that this obviously relevant factor had been taken into account. Indeed there is no indication as to what factors were taken into account. As the proper exercise of the discretion is a precondition to the exercise of the power to make a decision under s. 14(2), it is important that this court be satisfied on appeal that the discretion has in fact been exercised. It would be particularly helpful that the reasons given by the citizenship judge for refusing a favourable exercise of a discretion be indicated, at least in relation to compassionate grounds specifically urged by the applicant.
Order accordingly.
