Strickland, J.
: The Applicant seeks judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated March 11, 2013, in which it concluded that he was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 or 97, respectively, of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA).
Background
[2]
The Applicant is a citizen of Turkey, an ethnic Kurd and is of the Alevi faith. He claims that, beginning in 2009, he was subjected to a number of detentions and arrests resulting from his political activities. In November 2010, he was participating in a demonstration when he was arrested, held for one day and tortured by the police before being released without charge. In January 2011, he was arrested when distributing flyers on the anniversary of the disappearance of two Kurdish politicians while in state custody. At that time he was held and tortured for two days. He was again released without charge but not before a high ranking police officer threatened him with death if he was arrested again. Subsequently, the police harassed and subjected him to random searches and beatings. In March 2011, he was picked up, questioned and beaten by police. Unable to tolerate further such treatment, in May 2011 he obtained a US visa. He flew to the US on June 12, 2001. There, he retained a human smuggler who arranged his entry into Canada on August 3, 2011 where he made a claim for refugee protection.
Decision Under Review
[3]
The RPD found that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA because he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Turkey on any of the five Convention grounds. Nor was he a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97 as, on the balance of probabilities, his removal to Turkey would not subject him personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.
[4]
The RPD stated that the determinative issue was credibility and that it also considered the well-foundedness of the Applicant's alleged fear due to his Kurd and Alevi identity.
[5]
The RPD stated that there were several concerns that, collectively, led to its finding that the Applicant was not credible. In the result, it also found that the events of persecution alleged did not occur and, therefore, that there was insufficient credible evidence to conclude that there is a serious possibility that such events would occur in the future.
[6]
The RPD noted that the claim was undocumented until the day of the hearing. At the hearing, the Applicant submitted a package of documents which he testified had been sent to him from his cousin in Turkey. His cousin had picked up all of the documents, except one, from a lawyer that the Applicant had consulted but not retained. He could not provide the envelope which the package of documents had arrived in or the envelopes in which some of them may have been delivered within Turkey. The Applicant stated that he had consulted a lawyer in Turkey to seek protection from his alleged agents of persecution. When asked why he had not stated this in his Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative he explained that there were so many things that he mentioned only some and not all of them. The RPD did not accept that explanation and noted that he was represented by counsel when he completed the PIF. The RPD found this to be an embellishment at the hearing and drew from it a negative credibility inference. Consequently it found that the documents "are at the very least assigned a lesser weight by the Panel, and in fact this provides some cause to find these documents to be not genuine."
[7]
The RPD questioned how legal and medical documents would be sent by the authorities to the Applicant's lawyer if he had not met or retained him. The Applicant explained that he had previously retained the lawyer on another matter, which the RPD found to contradict his testimony that he had never met the lawyer. Additionally, the Applicant could not document the existence of the lawyer or his relationship with him. From this, the RPD made another negative inference as to credibility and found this to be another reason to conclude that the documents alleged to originate from the lawyer were not genuine.
[8]
As to a medical report contained in the package of documents allegedly received from the lawyer and which concerned treatment following his January 2011 detention, the RPD also noted that the Applicant's PIF did not refer to this treatment. The RPD questioned why it was dated January 2011 when he testified that it was received by his lawyer four or five months before the hearing, being late 2012. The RPD did not accept his explanation that this was a file copy of the report. It also noted the absence of a medical report from Canada that might have corroborated his allegations of torture. The RPD found the claim of medical care to be an embellishment and drew a negative inference as to credibility.
[9]
As to an investigation note dated April 14, 2011 which the RPD found to be more like a notice to appear, it was addressed to the police from the prosecutor and required the Applicant, who was described as a suspect, to appear in court four days later. When asked why he would be described as a suspect as he had been detained and released, the Applicant stated that it was to give evidence but he did not recall if he had been told this upon his release. He was also asked why the document was sent to his house, given that it was addressed to the police, but he had no explanation for this. He also stated that it came to his house in May although it was dated April 14 and was a notice to appear four days later. Further, that he was away during this time but he could not explain why his parents, who were at home, did not tell him about the document until six months before the hearing. Based on this, the RPD found the document was not genuine.
[10]
The RPD stated that its finding that all of the documents submitted by the Applicant were not genuine was not the only reason that it determined that the Applicant was not credible. It also noted an inconsistency in his evidence concerning his opportunity to consult with counsel during the March 2009 detention which was unsatisfactorily explained and led to a negative inference as to credibility.
[11]
The RPD noted that, after his failed application for a Canadian visa in 2008, the Applicant made no attempt to leave Turkey between 2008 and 2011 although he claimed he had problems before 2009 and that they increased in severity. His explanation was that he felt he should wait a while before seeking another visa and that he had heard that it was only Canada which accepted refugees. The RPD noted his testimony that he started to more seriously fear Turkey in January 2011, but did not apply for a US visa until April 2011 and that he did not leave Turkey for a month after he received his visa. The RPD did not accept his explanation that it took that length of time to prepare his documents or to receive his visa and to borrow money. Nor did it accept his explanations as to why he spent two months in the US without making a claim for asylum, being a lack of money and because he was advised that Turkish asylum claims do not succeed in the US. The RPD also made a negative inference as to credibility based on an inconsistency in his testimony as to whether or not the person who gave this advice was a lawyer.
[12]
Given these delays and the failure to consider an asylum claim in the US, the RPD found that the Applicant did not have a subjective fear of remaining in or returning to Turkey and, because he alleged to have had that fear, it made a negative credibility finding. Further, that his testimony at the hearing that he was threatened with additional death threats by the police, when he had mentioned only one such threat in his PIF, was not satisfactorily explained and was found to be an embellishment from which a negative inference was drawn.
[13]
As to the question of whether the Applicant required protection from conscription in the Turkish military, at the hearing, he claimed to be a conscientious objector. However, he did not state this in his PIF and the RPD did not accept his explanation that he did not think of it at the time. This was again found to be an embellishment from which a negative inference as to credibility was drawn and from which the RPD also found that the Applicant did not require Canada's protection from conscription. And, based on its other credibility findings, it did not accept any of the stated reasons for not wanting to serve in the military and found that the Applicant simply did not wish to do his Turkish compulsory military service.
[14]
As to the question of whether the Applicant required protection because he is Alevi and Kurdish, the RPD reviewed the country documentation and found that Kurds who aggressively advocate for Kurdish rights might face persecution but, based on its credibility finding, concluded that the Applicant did not have that profile. And, while the documentation speaks of discrimination and some attacks on Alevi, there are millions of Alevis in Turkey and only a small number of attacks. In both cases, mere inclusion in either the ethnic or religious group did not lead to persecution. Thus, there was only a mere possibility that the claimant would be attacked and not a serious possibility of being persecuted.
Issues
[15]
I would frame the issues in this application as follows:
1. Is the RPD's credibility finding reasonable?
2. Did the RPD fail to address other grounds of persecution alleged by the Applicant?
Standard of Review
[16]
It is established jurisprudence that credibility findings are essentially pure findings of fact that are reviewable on a reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). Similarly, the weighing of evidence and the interpretation and assessment of evidence is also reviewed on a reasonableness standard ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26).
[17]
Reasonableness is concerned with the justification, transparency and intelligibility of the decision-making process, but also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
Analysis
ISSUE 1: Is the RPD's credibility finding reasonable?
Applicant's Position
[18]
The Applicant submits that the RPD's credibility findings are unreasonable because it adopted an overzealous and sometimes careless approach to the evidence resulting in credibility findings that are generally unsupported by the record. Based on these credibility findings, and contrary to the jurisprudence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), it unreasonably found that the documents were not genuine.
[19]
The Applicant also submits that the RPD erred in failing to assess the authenticity of the documents he submitted. Foreign documents are presumed to be valid unless there is evidence to the contrary (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (TD) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Here, they contained seals, stamps and signatures which have been recognized as security features going to authenticity (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Ru
]), however, the RPD focused only on the manner in which the documents were obtained.
Respondent's Position
[20]
The Respondent submits that the RPD found the Applicant not to be credible for many reasons. The Applicant does not take issue with any of these reasons, but argues that the RPD ought to have considered the authenticity of his documents. There is only a presumption that foreign documentation is valid and the RPD is entitled to assess the weight to be afforded to the documents (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It also provided valid reasons for doubting their authenticity (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Documents whose authenticity has not been undermined may, in appropriate circumstances, be assigned little or no weight, provided that the RPD explains why it did so (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Further, it is within the RPD's jurisdiction to decide questions of credibility and afford weight to the evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (TD)).
Analysis
[21]
The RPD determined that there were multiple reasons that, cumulatively, caused it to find that the Applicant was not credible. The Applicant imputes many of those findings and refers the Court to the evidence which he considers contradicts the decision.
[22]
Having reviewed each finding, the record and the submissions of the parties, it is my view that while it may be possible to disagree with some of the RPD's findings and that there may be some errors of analysis, viewed in whole, the decision falls within the range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
With respect to the RPD's findings of omissions from the Applicant's PIF concerning the consultation with a lawyer, medical assistance in Turkey, other death threats, and, that the Applicant was a conscientious observer, I would note that it is open to the RPD to base credibility findings on omissions and inconsistencies between Port of Entry notes, PIFs and a claimant's testimony at the hearing (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[24]
The Applicant testified that he had a lawyer in Turkey with whom he discussed his problems. When asked if he actually discussed his problems and obtained an opinion, the Applicant stated that he did not because he did not have enough time. When asked if he was a client of the lawyer, he replied that he had not retained him officially but that they had been in touch continuously because the Applicant was asking him questions and he was answering. He also stated that he had spoken to the lawyer in Turkey over telephone in an to attempt to obtain protection from the authorities in relation to his experiences in 2011, but that he did not meet him personally. When asked why he did not mention that he spoke to a lawyer regarding seeking protection in his PIF, he replied that there were many things, and therefore he did not mention everything briefly. The RPD noted that the Applicant was represented by counsel when he prepared his PIF.
[25]
In my view, while alone this was not a particularly significant omission, the RPD was not obliged to accept the Applicant's explanation and it was open to it to find this to be an embellishment and to draw a negative inference to credibility, particularly in light of the RPD's other credibility concerns (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[26]
Similarly, the RPD found that the Applicant had omitted to include in his PIF that he received medical assistance in Turkey as a result of the alleged assault while in custody in January 2011. His explanation for this was, again, that he did not mention everything in his PIF. The RPD was not obliged to accept this explanation (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) and, in my view, it was a significant omission as a hospital attendance would serve to confirm both the existence and severity of the assault. The RPD also noted that he did not produce the medical report until the day of the hearing.
[27]
The Applicant also testified at the hearing that he did not complain about the illegal police brutality to the prosecutor because in all four instances the police had threatened him with death. The RPD noted that in his PIF, the Applicant had only mentioned that he was threatened in this manner in connection with the January 2011 incident. It did not find his explanation that he had been particularly brutally beaten in January 2011 to satisfactorily explain the omission. Again, this was a reasonable finding.
[28]
The fourth omission concerned the Applicant's testimony at the hearing that he was a conscientious objector. The RPD found that this was not included in the Applicant's PIF in which he stated the following:
I strongly object serving in the Turkish army for many reasons. The Turkish army has been involved in the grave human rights violations against the Kurdish civilians in east and southeast of Turkey for many years. I will be persecuted in the army because of my profile.
[29]
A conscientious objector is defined as an individual having principled objections to military service, which is detailed under the third exception to the general rule that an applicant generally cannot claim refugee status under the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
(the Convention), and accordingly under section 96 of the IRPA, just because he does not want to serve in his country's army (James Hathaway,
The Law of Refugee Status
(Markham: Butterworths, 1991) [Hathaway]).
[30]
Persons claiming refugee status based on their conscientious objection to military service essentially form two specific groups: those who object to military service in general and those who object to serving in a particular conflict (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aff'd 2007 FCA 171 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[31]
The Applicant stated in his PIF that his objection was based on human rights violations against Kurdish civilians. Before the RPD, he stated that he was against killing and serving in any military service and for the reasons included in his PIF. While the definition of, and distinctions within, the term conscientious objector may not be understood or appreciated by all refugee claimants, in this case the Applicant was represented by counsel when he prepared his PIF and counsel would have appreciated the significance and importance of this term and the necessity of including it in the PIF. In my view, while alone this omission would not be fatal, what is being considered here is a cumulative negative credibility finding and this omission would contribute to that finding.
[32]
The next credibility findings to be considered involve the authenticity of the documents submitted by the Applicant and the existence of his lawyer in Turkey.
[33]
The RPD noted that the Applicant had not documented his claim in any way until the day of the hearing, even though it had been previously scheduled. There were then four documents provided: the January 11, 2011 medical report; an in absentia arrest warrant dated January 18, 2013; a record of suspect's statement dated January 8, 2011; and, an investigation note or notice to appear from the chief prosecutor's office dated April 14, 2011. The Applicant testified that his cousin had picked up three of these from the Applicant's lawyer in Turkey and mailed them to him together with the notice to appear. He did not have any envelopes in which they were sent or received. His testimony as to the Turkish lawyer is described above.
[34]
There is a presumption of validity in regard to foreign issued documents and the RPD is only entitled to doubt their validity if it has a valid reason to do ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Ru
, above, para 42). It is also well established that the assessment of the weight to be given to documents is a matter within the discretion of the tribunal assessing the evidence (
Ru
, above, at para 49).
[35]
There is a concern in this matter arising from the fact that the RPD does not address in its decision the fact that documents submitted by the Applicant contain stamps and signatures from authorities but that the RPD did not analyze these features. Jurisprudence has held that official stamps are recognized as security features (
Ru
, above, at para 49; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 18-19).
[36]
Given this, it is necessary to consider each of the documents and the RPD's findings so as to ascertain if this failure amounts to a reviewable error in these circumstances.
[37]
In my view, the RPD may have been overzealous in questioning the authenticity of the medical report because it was dated January 11, 2011. The Applicant explained that he had asked his cousin to obtain the report which he did four or five months before the hearing. The RPD asked why it was dated January 2011 if it was issued four or five months ago. On its face, the document does not have an issuance date. It is possible, as the Applicant explained, that it was a file copy and that the report was made on the date the Applicant was seen at the hospital. However, the RPD also found that the report was not genuine because of other credibility concerns, in particular, that the Applicant omitted to indicate in his PIF that he received medical attention after the alleged assault in custody of January 2011. Thus, the RPD had a valid reason to doubt the veracity of the document.
[38]
In my view, the RPD also reasonably questioned the investigation note which it found was more like a notice to appear. It is dated April 14, 2011, is addressed to the police from the prosecutor, and required the Applicant to appear in court as a suspect four days later, being on April 18, 2011. The RPD found that it was fraudulent because it identified the Applicant as a suspect but he stated that he had been detained and then released by the authorities. The RPD also noted that the Applicant stated that he believed it was sent to his house in May, yet it was addressed to the police, and required him to attend court in April. In my view, the RPD was not inconsistent in finding that the investigation note was more like a notice to appear, because that is precisely what it appears to be. The RPD's questioning of why a notice for the Applicant to appear would be directed to the police was a reasonable concern as was why his parents, who he stated received the investigation note at their home, had not alerted him to it until six months ago.
[39]
The RPD does not discuss the in absentia arrest warrant or the record of suspect's statement. However, it made a general finding that all of the documents sent by the lawyer were not genuine because it did not believe that the lawyer existed and because there was no envelope to prove that the documents were sent from Turkey. It was therefore reasonable for the RPD to question their authenticity. In any event, the omission to refer to these two documents is not determinative as the conclusion would have been the same ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 11).
[40]
As noted above, the Applicant did not mention his Turkish lawyer in his PIF and raised it for the first time at the hearing. A reading of the transcript of the hearing adds little clarity to the Applicant's relationship with the lawyer. The RPD acknowledged that it did not ask the Applicant to provide the name or location of the lawyer. Therefore, the Applicant is correct in stating that the RPD did not put this to the Applicant nor was he offered an opportunity at the hearing to provide documentation detailing the existence of the lawyer. However, the Applicant stated that he did not have a letter from the lawyer confirming his assistance. And, neither the Applicant, nor his counsel, stated at the hearing that they had documents to prove that the lawyer existed or that such verification could be obtained.
[41]
Given these circumstances, and in light of the RPD's other credibility findings, in my view, it was reasonable for the RPD to question whether the lawyer existed and to find that he did not. Even if the lawyer did exist, the RPD's cumulative negative credibility findings, including its findings concerning the medical report and investigation note, would alone have been sufficient to ground its conclusion.
[42]
The RPD also reasonably drew an adverse inference because the Applicant first indicated that he was provided with an opportunity to consult with counsel during his alleged detention of March 2009 and then testified that he did not think that he was offered the right. It did not accept his explanation that the event occurred several years ago.
[43]
That said, the RPD did make errors in its analysis. For example, it drew an adverse inference as to credibility in finding that the Applicant's testimony was inconsistent as to whether he spoke with a lawyer in the US. However, a review of the transcript indicates that the RPD drew an inconsistency where there was none. The Applicant stated that he did not speak with a lawyer in the US. The RPD also drew a negative inference as to the Applicant's credibility because he alleged, but the RPD found that he did not have, a subjective fear of remaining in or returning to Turkey. In my view, this is a peculiar and very dubious finding.
[44]
Notwithstanding these errors, the credibility determination, which was cumulative, remains supported by a number of reasonable findings (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 35).
ISSUE 2: Did the RPD fail to address other grounds of persecution alleged by the Applicant?
Applicant's Submissions
[45]
The Applicant submits that contrary to the RPD's finding, he raised three grounds of persecution in his PIF, as described in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 29-33, which might arise from objection to military service (see also
Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees,
para 168;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). These exceptions include:
(1) the claimant would suffer some a form of discriminatory treatment before during or even after compulsory military service based on race, religion, nationality, membership, or political opinion;
(2) the claimant is a conscientious objector;
(3) the claimant objects to serving in a war that is internationally condemned and contrary to principles of international and humanitarian law.
[46]
The Applicant submits that the RPD erred in failing to address the other grounds of his persecution, being the first and third exceptions above, and that this warrants overturning the decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Instead, it restricted its examination to whether he was a conscientious objector. The additional grounds are central to his claim and are not merely "an afterthought not supported by evidence" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). He stated that he fears being persecuted in the army because of his profile and he listed his objections to serving in the Turkish army. He also testified that he is a conscientious objector. The documentary evidence corroborates his objections and required the RPD to take them seriously.
Respondent's Submissions
[47]
The Respondent submits that the RPD did consider the Applicant's assertion of being a conscientious objector. Further, that the Applicant's evidence during the hearing when asked why he did not state that he was against killing for conscientious reasons was that he did not think of it at the time. Moreover, he was not found to be of a profile that would place him at a risk of persecution and there is no indication that the additional ground was central to his claim. The RPD considered whether he would be persecuted as a result of his ethnicity and religion, but reasonably found that he did not have the profile and therefore there was no serious possibility that he would be persecuted. The onus was on the Applicant to raise arguments concerning participation in a war that is internationally condemned. The RPD reasonably did not accept that he was a genuine conscientious objector.
Analysis
[48]
It is of note that in his application for leave and judicial review, the Applicant raised only one issue, being whether the RPD erred in analyzing his documents and, therefore, reached unreasonable credibility findings. The Applicant did not mention the issue of his objections to service in the Turkish military. Given this, it is difficult to accept, as the Applicant submits, that from the outset this ground of persecution has been a central and consistent part of his claim.
[49]
In his PIF the Applicant states:
I also fear that I will be forced to perform the mandatory military service. I strongly object serving in the Turkish army for many reasons. The Turkish army has been involved in the grave human rights violations against the Kurdish civilians in east and southeast of Turkey for many years. I will be persecuted in the army because of my profile.
[50]
In my view, the RPD appears to have considered and reasonably rejected the Applicant's alleged grounds of persecution. The RPD noted the Applicant's claim that he feared conscription. It found that it was possible that he would be conscripted, but that he had not produced any call notices. He explained that this was because he was exempted from conscription as he was in university. The RPD found that it was also possible that he completed his military service.
[51]
The RPD also noted his allegation at the hearing that he is a conscientious objector but reasonably rejected this submission. While in his PIF he stated that he did not wish to serve in the Turkish military because it is involved in human rights violations against his own people, the Kurds, and because he would be maltreated in the military, he did not claim that he was a conscientious objector. The RPD did not accept his explanation that he did not think of it at the time finding that this would be a very significant reason why a person would not want to serve. The RPD found this to be an embellishment at the hearing and drew an adverse inference as to credibility. Significantly, considering its other credibility concerns, the RPD stated that it also did not accept any of the Applicant's stated reasons for not wanting to serve and found that he simply did not wish to do so.
[52]
In
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice de Montigny confirmed that a claimant generally cannot claim refugee status under the Refugee Convention and, therefore, section 96 of the IRPA, solely because he does not want to serve in his country's army. However, that there are three exceptions to this being:
i) when conscription for a legitimate and lawful purpose is conducted in a discriminatory way or the punishment for desertion is biased in relation to a Convention ground;
ii) when there is an implied political opinion that the military service is fundamentally illegitimate under international law;
iii) when individuals have "principled objections" to military service (i.e. conscientious objectors)
[53]
Conscientious objection applies to those who are completely opposed to war because of their politics, ethics or religion and raises subjective issues. Selective objection refers to cases which an applicant opposes a war he feels violates international standards of law and human rights and requires both a subjective and objective assessment of the facts. Thus, a decision-maker must evaluate the sincerity of an applicant's beliefs and determine whether the conflict objectively violates international standards. The two types of objections should be treated as distinct categories.
[54]
The Applicant refers to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, in support of his view that the RPD erred in failing to address two grounds of persecution that he claimed. In that case a visa officer did not address the applicant's fear of persecution on the basis of having left the country illegally. Justice Snider stated that:
[103] The Respondent argues that the Officer testified that she did not find the Applicant to be credible; therefore, she was under no obligation to consider all of the relevant bases for persecution. This would be a sound response if (a) the credibility findings are reasonable; and (b) if the credibility findings clearly foreclosed all other grounds of persecution.
[104] I acknowledge that, in general, a negative credibility finding (if reasonable and made with regard to the evidence) will mean that the decision maker does not have to look further into the claim. For example, if a visa officer concludes that a claimant was never imprisoned, it follows that a claim based on a fear of being returned to detention is not sustainable. However, if the claimant puts forward facts that raise an additional ground of persecution, that part of the claim still needs to be assessed, unless the visa officer clearly finds that part of the claim to also lack credibility.
[...]
[106] It would have been open to the Officer to consider this additional ground of persecution and reject it; however, this is not what the Officer did. She had no explanation for why she did not assess this risk. The Respondent asks this Court to accept that the Officer was under no obligation to consider these additional risks because she did not find the Applicant's story to be credible. However, that was not the reason why the Officer did not consider these additional grounds of persecution. She had no explanation. This is a reviewable error that, on its own, would warrant overturning the Officer's decision.
[55]
In the present case, unlike <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the RPD clearly addressed the Applicant's claim to be a conscientious observer and then went on to explicitly reject the other bases of his reasons for not wishing to serve in the Turkish military because of its credibility findings. It should also be noted that general findings of a lack of credibility can affect all relevant evidence submitted by an applicant and ultimately cause the rejection of a claim (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[56]
In any event, the Applicant's claim as advanced could not succeed on this ground (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In my view, neither the Applicant's evidence, or the limited documentary evidence he submitted in support of his position, would have been sufficient to establish the depths or sincerity of his belief so as to establish that he was a conscientious observer, or, that he would be required to participate in military activities considered to violate existing international standards. Nor did it establish that if conscripted he would be persecuted because of his profile. That is, he did not establish that he fell within the established exceptions to the general rule that a claimant cannot claim refugee status because he does not wish to serve in his country's army.
[57]
For the reasons set out above, this application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[58]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed; and
2. No question of general importance was proposed or arises for certification.

Le contexte
[2]
Le demandeur, un Turc d'origine kurde et de religion alévie, affirme que, à partir de 2009, il a été la cible de plusieurs détentions et arrestations à cause de ses activités politiques. En novembre 2010, il participait à une manifestation lorsqu'il a été arrêté, détenu durant une journée et torturé par la police avant d'être relâché, sans être accusé. En janvier 2011, il a été arrêté alors qu'il distribuait des tracts portant sur l'anniversaire de la disparition de deux politiciens kurdes alors qu'ils étaient sous la garde de l'État. Cette fois-là, il a été détenu et torturé durant deux jours. Il a de nouveau été relâché sans être accusé, mais pas avant qu'un haut gradé de la police n'eût proféré contre lui des menaces de mort s'il était arrêté une nouvelle fois. Plus tard, la police l'a harcelé et l'a soumis au hasard à des fouilles et à des passages à tabac. En mars 2011, il a été appréhendé par la police, qui l'a interrogé et battu. Incapable d'en supporter davantage, il a obtenu en mai 2011 un visa des États-Unis. Il s'est envolé pour les États-Unis le 12 juin 2001. Là, il s'est adressé à un passeur qui s'est arrangé pour le faire entrer le 3 août 2011 au Canada, où il a présenté une demande d'asile.
La décision contestée
[3]
La SPR a estimé que le demandeur n'était pas un réfugié au sens de la Convention selon l'article 96 de la LIPR parce qu'il ne craignait pas avec raison d'être persécuté en Turquie pour l'un quelconque des cinq motifs prévus par la Convention. Il n'était pas non plus une personne à protéger selon l'article 97, étant donné que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, son renvoi en Turquie ne l'exposerait pas personnellement à une menace à sa vie, au risque de subir des traitements ou peines cruels et inusités, ou au risque d'être soumis à la torture.
[4]
Selon la SPR, l'élément déterminant était la crédibilité, mais elle a aussi examiné si le demandeur était fondé à craindre pour sa sécurité à cause de son origine kurde et de sa foi alévie.
[5]
Selon la SPR, il subsistait plusieurs points douteux qui, ensemble, l'ont amenée à conclure que le demandeur n'était pas crédible. Finalement, elle a aussi estimé que les prétendues persécutions n'avaient pas eu lieu et qu'elle ne disposait donc pas d'une preuve crédible et suffisante lui permettant de conclure à une réelle possibilité que le demandeur subisse de telles persécutions dans l'avenir.
[6]
La SPR a relevé que la demande d'asile n'avait été étayée par des documents justificatifs que le jour de l'audience. À l'audience, le demandeur a produit un ensemble de documents qui, selon ce qu'il affirmait, lui avait été envoyé de Turquie par son cousin. Son cousin avait recueilli tous les documents, sauf un, auprès d'un avocat que le demandeur avait consulté, mais qu'il n'avait pas engagé. Il n'avait pu produire l'enveloppe dans laquelle l'ensemble de documents était arrivé, ni les enveloppes dans lesquelles certains d'entre eux avaient pu être transmis en Turquie même. Le demandeur affirmait qu'il avait consulté un avocat en Turquie pour obtenir une protection de ses prétendus agents de persécution. Prié de dire pourquoi il n'en avait pas fait état dans l'exposé circonstancié contenu dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (le FRP), il a expliqué qu'il y avait tant d'éléments à signaler qu'il n'en avait retenu que quelques-uns, pas tous. La SPR n'a pas accepté cette explication, en relevant qu'il était représenté par un conseil lorsqu'il avait rempli le FRP. Elle a estimé que le demandeur avait cherché à embellir son récit à l'audience et elle en a conclu qu'il n'était pas crédible. Elle a jugé par conséquent que « le tribunal accorde moins d'importance aux documents [...], ce qui, en fait, donne certains motifs permettant de conclure que les documents ne sont pas authentiques ».
[7]
La SPR s'est interrogée sur la manière dont des documents juridiques et médicaux pourraient être envoyés par les autorités à l'avocat du demandeur si le demandeur n'avait pas rencontré cet avocat ni ne l'avait engagé. Le demandeur a expliqué qu'il avait auparavant engagé l'avocat pour une autre affaire, ce qui, pour la SPR, contredisait son témoignage selon lequel il n'avait jamais rencontré l'avocat. En outre, le demandeur n'avait pu prouver l'existence de l'avocat, ni sa relation avec lui. La SPR a donc à nouveau mis en doute la crédibilité du demandeur et estimé que c'était là une autre raison de conclure que les documents censés provenir de l'avocat n'étaient pas authentiques.
[8]
En ce qui concerne un rapport médical contenu dans l'ensemble de documents censément reçu de l'avocat, rapport qui concernait des soins reçus par le demandeur après sa détention de janvier 2011, la SPR a également relevé que les soins en question n'étaient pas mentionnés dans le FRP du demandeur. Elle s'est interrogée sur la raison pour laquelle le rapport était daté de janvier 2011, alors que le demandeur avait affirmé qu'il avait été reçu par son avocat quatre ou cinq mois avant l'audience, c'est-à-dire à la fin de l'année 2012. La SPR n'a pas accepté l'explication du demandeur pour qui il s'agissait d'une copie du rapport. Elle a aussi relevé l'absence d'un rapport médical délivré au Canada qui aurait pu confirmer les tortures qu'il disait avoir subies. La SPR a trouvé que les prétendus soins médicaux ne visaient qu'à embellir le récit du demandeur et en a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible.
[9]
En ce qui concerne une note d'enquête datée du 14 avril 2011, note qui, selon la SPR, ressemblait davantage à un avis de convocation, elle était adressée à la police par le procureur et elle intimait au demandeur, qui y était qualifié de suspect, l'ordre de se présenter devant la cour quatre jours plus tard. Prié de dire pourquoi il y était qualifié de suspect compte tenu du fait qu'il avait été détenu, puis libéré, le demandeur avait déclaré qu'il devait se présenter en cour pour témoigner, mais il ne se souvenait pas si c'est ce qu'on lui avait dit au moment de le libérer. La SPR l'a aussi prié de dire pourquoi le document avait été envoyé chez lui, puisqu'il était adressé à la police, mais il n'avait pas été en mesure de fournir une explication. Il avait aussi déclaré que le document était arrivé chez lui en mai bien qu'il fût daté du 14 avril et que ce fût un avis lui ordonnant de se présenter quatre jours plus tard. Il avait ajouté qu'il avait été absent de chez lui durant cette période, mais il n'avait pu expliquer pourquoi ses parents, qui se trouvaient à la maison, ne lui avaient parlé du document que six mois avant l'audience. La SPR en a conclu que le document n'était pas authentique.
[10]
La SPR a déclaré que sa conclusion selon laquelle aucun des documents produits par le demandeur n'était authentique n'était pas l'unique raison l'ayant conduit à conclure que le demandeur n'était pas crédible. Elle avait aussi relevé une contradiction dans son témoignage à propos de la possibilité qu'il avait eue de consulter un avocat au cours de la détention de mars 2009, contradiction que le demandeur n'avait pu expliquer d'une manière satisfaisante et qui a conduit la SPR à tirer une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité.
[11]
La SPR a relevé que, après sa tentative avortée d'obtenir un visa canadien en 2008, le demandeur n'avait pas cherché à quitter la Turquie entre 2008 et 2011, alors qu'il prétendait avoir eu, avant 2009, des problèmes de plus en plus graves. Il avait expliqué qu'il avait eu le sentiment qu'il devrait attendre quelque temps avant de solliciter un autre visa et qu'il avait entendu dire que le Canada était le seul pays à accueillir des réfugiés. La SPR a pris note de son témoignage où il disait qu'il avait commencé à craindre plus sérieusement la Turquie en janvier 2011, mais qu'il n'avait sollicité un visa des États-Unis qu'en avril 2011 et qu'il était resté en Turquie durant un mois après avoir reçu son visa. La SPR n'a pas accepté son explication selon laquelle il lui avait fallu tout ce temps pour préparer ses documents ou recevoir son visa et emprunter de l'argent. Elle ne l'a pas cru non plus quand il avait donné les raisons pour lesquelles il avait passé deux mois aux États-Unis sans présenter une demande d'asile, à savoir un manque d'argent et le fait qu'on l'avait informé que les demandes d'asile présentées par des Turcs n'avaient aucune chance d'être acceptées aux États-Unis. La SPR a également tiré une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité du demandeur, car il s'était contredit dans son témoignage sur la question de savoir si la personne qui lui avait dit cela était ou non un avocat.
[12]
Vu les atermoiements du demandeur et le fait qu'il n'avait pas songé à présenter une demande d'asile aux États-Unis, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas quelqu'un qui craignait subjectivement de demeurer en Turquie ou d'y retourner, et, parce qu'il prétendait avoir eu cette crainte, la SPR a conclu qu'il n'était pas crédible. En outre, il avait affirmé devant la SPR que la police avait proféré contre lui de nouvelles menaces de mort, alors qu'il n'avait mentionné qu'une seule menace du genre dans son FRP. Il n'avait pu expliquer cette contradiction d'une manière satisfaisante, et la SPR, jugeant que le demandeur cherchait à embellir son récit, en a tiré une conclusion défavorable.
[13]
Pour ce qui est de savoir si le demandeur nécessitait d'être protégé contre un enrôlement dans l'armée turque, il avait prétendu devant la SPR être un objecteur de conscience. Cependant, il n'en avait pas fait état dans son FRP, et la SPR a rejeté son explication selon laquelle il n'y avait pas songé à l'époque. Encore une fois, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur avait cherché à embellir son récit, et elle en a tiré une conclusion défavorable sur sa crédibilité, estimant en outre que le demandeur n'avait pas besoin de la protection du Canada pour échapper à un enrôlement. Et, compte tenu de ses autres conclusions sur la crédibilité du demandeur, elle n'a accepté aucune des raisons avancées par le demandeur pour refuser de rejoindre l'armée et a estimé qu'il ne voulait tout simplement pas faire son service militaire, une obligation en Turquie.
[14]
Pour ce qui est de savoir si le demandeur nécessitait d'être protégé parce qu'il pratique la religion alévie et qu'il est Kurde, la SPR a passé en revue la documentation pertinente et constaté que les Kurdes qui revendiquent bruyamment des droits pour leur peuple s'exposent à la persécution, mais, puisque selon elle le demandeur n'était pas crédible, elle a conclu qu'il n'avait pas ce profil. Et, bien que la documentation fasse état de discrimination et de certains cas de violence contre les alévis, il y a des millions d'alévis en Turquie et un petit nombre seulement de cas de violences. Dans les deux cas, le simple fait d'appartenir au groupe ethnique ou au groupe religieux ne voulait pas dire persécution. Il n'existait donc qu'une simple possibilité que le demandeur d'asile soit la cible de violences, et il n'y avait pas lieu de croire qu'il serait persécuté.
Les questions en litige
[15]
J'énoncerais de la manière suivante les questions soulevées dans la présente demande:
1. La conclusion de la SPR relative à la crédibilité était-elle raisonnable?
2. La SPR a-t-elle omis de tenir compte d'autres motifs de persécution allégués par le demandeur?
La norme de contrôle applicable
[16]
Il est établi dans la jurisprudence que les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité sont essentiellement de pures conclusions de fait qui sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). De façon similaire, l'importance attribuée à la preuve, l'interprétation et l'appréciation de cette preuve sont aussi susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 26).
[17]
Le caractère raisonnable d'une décision tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47 [l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
Analyse
QUESTION N° 1: La conclusion de la SPR relative à la crédibilité était-elle raisonnable?
La position du demandeur
[18]
Selon le demandeur, les conclusions de la SPR sur sa crédibilité sont déraisonnables parce que la SPR a fait de l'excès de zèle, et parfois montré un manque de soin, dans sa manière d'apprécier la preuve, pour aboutir à des conclusions sur sa crédibilité qui ne sont pas en général étayées par le dossier. S'appuyant sur ces conclusions, et au mépris de la jurisprudence (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), la SPR a conclu de façon déraisonnable que les documents n'étaient pas authentiques.
[19]
Le demandeur soutient aussi que la SPR a commis une erreur en omettant d'évaluer l'authenticité des documents qu'il avait produits. Les documents étrangers sont présumés valides à moins d'une preuve contraire (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 5 (1re inst.) [la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Ici, les documents portaient des sceaux, des cachets et des signatures qui ont été reconnus comme éléments de sécurité attestant leur authenticité (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 19 [la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 42 et 48 [la décision
Ru
]), or la SPR ne s'est arrêtée qu'à la manière dont les documents avaient été obtenus.
La position du défendeur
[20]
Selon le défendeur, la SPR a trouvé que le demandeur n'était pas crédible, et cela pour une foule de raisons. Le demandeur ne remet en question aucune des raisons avancées, mais il soutient que la SPR aurait dû s'exprimer sur l'authenticité de ses documents. La validité de documents étrangers n'est qu'une présomption, et la SPR est fondée à juger du poids qu'il convient d'accorder aux documents (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Elle avait aussi de bonnes raisons de douter de leur authenticité (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Des documents dont l'authenticité n'a pas été mise à mal peuvent, dans les cas qui le justifient, se voir attribuer peu de poids, voire aucun, pour autant que la SPR en donne la raison (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Il relève d'ailleurs de la compétence de la SPR de trancher les questions de crédibilité et de déterminer le poids qu'il convient d'accorder à la preuve (arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA); décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1re inst.)).
Analyse
[21]
La SPR a estimé qu'une foule de raisons, considérées ensemble, l'obligeait à conclure que le demandeur n'était pas crédible. Le demandeur conteste bon nombre des conclusions de la SPR et renvoie la Cour à la preuve, qui, selon lui, contredit la décision de la SPR.
[22]
Après examen de chacune des conclusions, ainsi que du dossier et des arguments des parties, je suis d'avis que, bien qu'il soit possible de ne pas souscrire à certaines des conclusions de la SPR et que la SPR ait sans doute commis quelques erreurs d'analyse, sa décision, considérée globalement, appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
En ce qui concerne les omissions constatées par la SPR dans le FRP du demandeur, à savoir le fait qu'il avait consulté un avocat, le fait qu'il avait reçu des soins médicaux en Turquie, le fait qu'on avait proféré contre lui d'autres menaces de mort, et le fait qu'il était un objecteur de conscience, je ferais observer qu'il est loisible à la SPR de juger de la crédibilité d'un demandeur d'asile en se fondant sur les omissions constatées et sur les contradictions entre les notes prises au point d'entrée, les FRP et le témoignage du demandeur d'asile à l'audience (arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[24]
Le demandeur a témoigné qu'il avait en Turquie un avocat avec qui il s'était entretenu de ses difficultés. Prié de dire s'il s'était véritablement entretenu de ses difficultés avec lui et s'il avait obtenu l'avis de l'avocat, le demandeur avait répondu par la négative, affirmant que le temps lui avait manqué. Prié de dire s'il était un client de l'avocat, il a répondu qu'il ne l'avait pas engagé officiellement, mais qu'ils étaient demeurés en contact d'une manière continue parce que le demandeur lui posait des questions, auxquelles l'avocat répondait. Il avait aussi affirmé qu'il s'était entretenu avec l'avocat en Turquie par téléphone pour tenter d'obtenir une protection des autorités à la suite de ce qu'il avait vécu en 2011, mais qu'il ne l'avait pas rencontré en personne. Prié de dire pourquoi il n'avait pas précisé dans son FRP qu'il s'était entretenu avec un avocat dans l'espoir d'obtenir une protection, il a répondu qu'il y avait une foule d'éléments à signaler, et qu'il ne les avait donc pas tous mentionnés, ne serait-ce que brièvement. La SPR a relevé que le demandeur était représenté par un conseil au moment de rédiger son FRP.
[25]
À mon avis, bien qu'il ne s'agisse pas là en soi d'une omission particulièrement symptomatique, la SPR n'était pas tenue d'accepter l'explication donnée par le demandeur, et il lui était loisible de considérer que le demandeur cherchait à embellir son histoire et donc de mettre en doute sa sincérité, d'autant plus qu'elle avait d'autres raisons de la mettre en doute (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[26]
De même, la SPR a vu que le demandeur avait omis de préciser dans son FRP qu'il avait reçu des soins médicaux en Turquie après avoir prétendument subi des violences durant sa détention en janvier 2011. Il avait expliqué, là encore, qu'il n'avait pas tout mentionné dans son FRP. La SPR n'était pas obligée d'accepter cette explication (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) et, selon moi, c'était là une omission de taille, étant donné qu'une admission à l'hôpital ne pourrait que confirmer à la fois la réalité et la gravité des violences. La SPR a aussi relevé que le demandeur n'avait produit le rapport médical que le jour de l'audience.
[27]
Le demandeur avait aussi affirmé devant la SPR que, s'il ne s'était pas plaint des brutalités policières auprès du procureur, c'était parce que, dans les quatre cas, la police l'avait menacé de mort. La SPR a relevé que, dans son FRP, le demandeur avait précisé qu'il n'avait été menacé de la sorte que lors de l'incident de janvier 2011. Pour la SPR, l'explication du demandeur selon laquelle il avait été battu avec une particulière brutalité en janvier 2011 n'expliquait pas l'omission de façon satisfaisante. Là encore, la conclusion de la SPR était raisonnable.
[28]
La quatrième omission concernait le témoignage rendu par le demandeur à l'audience, où il avait affirmé être un objecteur de conscience. La SPR a constaté que cet élément ne figurait pas dans le FRP du demandeur, où il a écrit ce qui suit:
[traduction] Je m'oppose fermement à mon enrôlement dans l'armée turque, pour de nombreuses raisons. L'armée turque est impliquée, depuis de nombreuses années, dans de graves violations des droits de l'homme commises à l'encontre des populations civiles kurdes, à l'est et au sud-est de la Turquie. Je serai persécuté dans l'armée à cause de mon profil.
[29]
Un objecteur de conscience est défini comme une personne qui a des objections de principe au service militaire. Il s'agit là de la troisième exception à la règle générale selon laquelle un demandeur ne peut généralement revendiquer le statut de réfugié au titre de la Convention relative au statut des réfugiés des Nations Unies (la Convention), et par conséquent au titre de l'article 96 de la LIPR, du seul fait qu'il ne souhaite pas servir dans l'armée de son pays (James Hathaway,
The Law of Refugee Status
(Markham, Butterworths, 1991) [Hathaway]).
[30]
Les personnes qui revendiquent le statut de réfugié en invoquant leur objection de conscience au service militaire se répartissent essentiellement en deux groupes: ceux qui s'opposent au service militaire en général et ceux qui refusent de servir dans un conflit donné (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision confirmée: 2007 CAF 171 [la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[31]
Le demandeur a écrit dans son FRP que son objection était fondée sur les violations des droits de la personne commises contre les civils kurdes. Devant la SPR, il avait dit qu'il était opposé à l'idée de tuer et à l'idée de servir dans toute armée, pour les raisons invoquées dans son FRP. La définition de l'expression « objecteur de conscience », ainsi que les distinctions que comporte cette expression, ne sont peut-être pas comprises ou saisies par tous les demandeurs d'asile, mais le demandeur était en l'espèce représenté par un conseil au moment de rédiger son FRP, et son conseil aurait compris le sens et l'importance de cette expression ainsi que la nécessité d'en faire état dans le FRP. À mon avis, même si cette omission, à elle seule, n'était pas fatale, ce qui est considéré ici, c'est une conclusion globale de non-crédibilité du demandeur, et une telle omission renforçait cette conclusion.
[32]
Les autres conclusions de non-crédibilité qu'il convient d'examiner concernent l'authenticité des documents produits par le demandeur, ainsi que l'existence de son avocat en Turquie.
[33]
La SPR a relevé que le demandeur avait attendu le jour de l'audience pour adjoindre des documents justificatifs à sa demande d'asile, alors même que l'audience avait déjà été programmée. Quatre documents avaient alors été produits: le rapport médical du 11 janvier 2011, un mandat d'arrêt
in absentia
daté du 18 janvier 2013, un compte rendu de déclaration du suspect daté du 8 janvier 2011, enfin une note d'enquête ou un avis de convocation délivré par le cabinet du procureur en chef et daté du 14 avril 2011. Le demandeur a témoigné que son cousin avait recueilli trois de ces documents auprès de l'avocat du demandeur en Turquie et qu'il les lui avait envoyés par la poste, accompagnés de l'avis de convocation. Il n'avait pas les enveloppes dans lesquelles les documents avaient été envoyés ou reçus. Son témoignage relatif à l'avocat turc est décrit plus haut.
[34]
Il existe une présomption de validité des documents délivrés à l'étranger, et la SPR n'est fondée à mettre en doute leur validité que si elle a une raison légitime de le faire (décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision
Ru
, précitée, au paragraphe 42). Il est constant aussi que le poids qu'il convient d'accorder à des documents relève du pouvoir discrétionnaire du tribunal qui apprécie la preuve (décision
Ru
, précitée, au paragraphe 49).
[35]
Il y a lieu ici de s'interroger sur le fait que la SPR semble oublier dans sa décision que les documents produits par le demandeur contiennent des cachets et des signatures provenant d'autorités, éléments que néanmoins elle n'a pas analysés. Selon la jurisprudence, les cachets officiels sont reconnus comme éléments de sécurité (décision
Ru
, précitée, au paragraphe 49; décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, aux paragraphes 18 et 19).
[36]
Il est donc nécessaire d'examiner chacun des documents ainsi que les conclusions de la SPR pour savoir si cette omission de la SPR équivaut ici à une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[37]
À mon avis, la SPR a sans doute fait un excès de zèle quand elle a mis en doute l'authenticité du rapport médical parce qu'il était daté du 11 janvier 2011. Le demandeur a expliqué qu'il avait prié son cousin d'obtenir le rapport, ce que le cousin avait fait quatre ou cinq mois avant l'audience. La SPR avait prié le demandeur de dire pourquoi le rapport était daté de janvier 2011 s'il avait été délivré quatre ou cinq mois auparavant. À première vue, le document n'indique aucune date de délivrance. Il est possible, comme l'a expliqué le demandeur, qu'il s'agissait d'une copie et que le rapport avait été établi le jour où le demandeur avait été examiné à l'hôpital. Cependant, la SPR a aussi conclu que le rapport n'était pas authentique en raison d'autres interrogations sur la crédibilité du demandeur, en particulier le fait que le demandeur avait omis de préciser dans son FRP qu'il avait reçu des soins médicaux après avoir prétendument été victime de violences durant sa détention de janvier 2011. La SPR avait donc une raison légitime de mettre en doute l'authenticité du document.
[38]
Selon moi, la SPR a également eu raison de mettre en doute la note d'enquête, qui, selon elle, ressemblait davantage à un avis de convocation. La note porte la date du 14 avril 2011, elle est adressée à la police par le procureur, et elle intimait au demandeur l'ordre de se présenter à la cour en tant que suspect quatre jours plus tard, c'est-à-dire le 18 avril 2011. La SPR a jugé que le document était un faux parce qu'il qualifiait le demandeur de suspect alors que le demandeur avait affirmé qu'il avait été détenu, puis relâché par les autorités. La SPR a aussi relevé que le demandeur avait affirmé qu'il croyait que le document avait été envoyé chez lui en mai, or le document était adressé à la police, et il le priait de se présenter devant la cour en avril. À mon avis, la SPR n'a pas été inconséquente en concluant que la note d'enquête ressemblait davantage à un avis de convocation, parce que c'est précisément ce qu'il semble être. La SPR était fondée à s'interroger sur la raison pour laquelle un avis de convocation destiné au demandeur serait adressé à la police, ainsi que sur la raison pour laquelle ses parents, qui, selon ses dires, avaient reçu la note d'enquête chez eux, ne l'en avaient informé que six mois auparavant.
[39]
La SPR ne parle pas du mandat d'arrêt
in absentia
, ni du compte rendu de déclaration du suspect. Cependant, elle a conclu de manière générale qu'aucun des documents envoyés par l'avocat n'était authentique parce que, selon elle, l'avocat n'existait pas et qu'il n'y avait aucune enveloppe prouvant que les documents avaient été envoyés à partir de la Turquie. Il était donc raisonnable pour la SPR de mettre en doute leur authenticité. Quoi qu'il en soit, le fait pour la SPR de ne pas avoir évoqué ces deux documents n'est pas déterminant, car la conclusion aurait été la même (décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 11).
[40]
Comme je l'ai déjà mentionné, le demandeur n'a pas fait mention de son avocat turc dans son FRP et n'en a parlé pour la première fois qu'à l'audience de la SPR. La lecture de la transcription de l'audience ne permet guère d'en savoir davantage sur la relation du demandeur avec l'avocat. La SPR reconnaissait ne pas avoir prié le demandeur de donner le nom de l'avocat, ni l'endroit où il se trouvait. Le demandeur a donc raison d'affirmer que la SPR n'avait pas évoqué ces aspects avec lui, et qu'il n'avait pas eu l'occasion à l'audience de produire des documents attestant l'existence de l'avocat. Cependant, le demandeur avait affirmé qu'il n'avait pas de lettre de l'avocat confirmant l'aide reçue de celui-ci. Par ailleurs, ni le demandeur ni son conseil devant la SPR n'avaient déclaré à l'audience qu'ils étaient en possession de documents prouvant que l'avocat existait ou que son existence pouvait être vérifiée.
[41]
Dans ces conditions, et compte tenu des autres conclusions de la SPR concernant la crédibilité du demandeur, il était selon moi raisonnable pour la SPR de s'interroger sur l'existence de l'avocat et de conclure qu'il n'existait pas. Même s'il existait, la SPR avait tiré une série de conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité du demandeur, ce à quoi s'ajoutaient ses conclusions touchant le rapport médical et la note d'enquête, et toutes ces conclusions auraient suffi à fonder sa décision.
[42]
La SPR a eu raison également de tirer une conclusion défavorable parce que le demandeur avait d'abord déclaré qu'on lui avait offert la possibilité de consulter un avocat durant sa prétendue détention de mars 2009, pour témoigner ensuite qu'il ne pensait pas qu'on lui avait offert le droit en question. La SPR n'a pas accepté son explication selon laquelle les faits en question avaient eu lieu plusieurs années auparavant.
[43]
Cela dit, la SPR a néanmoins commis des erreurs dans son analyse. Par exemple, elle a jugé que le demandeur n'était pas crédible parce que, selon elle, il s'était contredit dans son témoignage concernant le point de savoir s'il s'était entretenu avec un avocat aux États-Unis. Cependant, un examen de la transcription montre que la SPR a décelé une contradiction où il n'y en avait aucune. Le demandeur avait déclaré ne pas avoir consulté d'avocat aux États-Unis. La SPR a également douté de la sincérité du demandeur parce qu'il avait affirmé être une personne qui craignait subjectivement de devoir rester en Turquie ou de devoir y retourner, crainte que selon la SPR il n'avait pas. À mon avis, c'est là une conclusion bizarre et très équivoque.
[44]
Malgré ces erreurs, la conclusion générale de non-crédibilité demeure étayée par un certain nombre de conclusions raisonnables (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 35).
QUESTION N° 2: La SPR a-t-elle omis de tenir compte d'autres motifs de persécution allégués par le demandeur?
Les observations du demandeur
[45]
Le demandeur affirme que, contrairement à la conclusion de la SPR, il avait soulevé dans son FRP trois motifs de persécution, décrits dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, aux paragraphes 29 à 33, qui pourraient résulter d'une objection au service militaire (voir aussi le
Guide des procédures et critères à appliquer pour déterminer le statut de réfugié au regard de la Convention de 1951 et du Protocole de 1967 relatifs au statut des réfugiés
, paragraphe 168; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée). Ces exceptions sont les suivantes:
(1) le demandeur d'asile subirait, avant, durant ou même après un service militaire obligatoire, une forme de traitement discriminatoire du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques;
(2) le demandeur d'asile est un objecteur de conscience;
(3) le demandeur d'asile refuse de participer à une guerre condamnée par la communauté internationale et contraire aux principes du droit international humanitaire.
[46]
Selon le demandeur, la SPR s'est abstenue, à tort, de considérer les autres motifs de sa persécution, à savoir les première et troisième exceptions susmentionnées, et sa décision devrait donc être annulée (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). La SPR s'est plutôt limitée à la question de savoir s'il était un objecteur de conscience. Chacun des autres motifs intéresse éminemment sa demande d'asile et n'est pas simplement un « motif [...] invoqué après coup, sans être étayé par la preuve » (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le demandeur affirmait craindre d'être persécuté au sein de l'armée en raison de son profil, et il avait énuméré les raisons qu'il avait de refuser de servir dans l'armée turque. Il avait aussi témoigné être un objecteur de conscience. La preuve documentaire confirme les raisons qu'il avait énumérées et elle obligeait la SPR à les prendre au sérieux.
Les observations du défendeur
[47]
Selon le défendeur, la SPR a bel et bien tenu compte de l'affirmation du demandeur selon laquelle il est un objecteur de conscience. Par ailleurs, quand la SPR l'avait prié de dire pourquoi il n'avait pas déclaré que c'était pour des raisons de conscience qu'il était contre l'idée de tuer, il avait répondu qu'il n'y avait pas pensé à l'époque. D'ailleurs, la SPR n'a pas trouvé qu'il présentait un profil susceptible de l'exposer à un risque de persécution, et il n'apparaît pas que le motif additionnel était d'une importance capitale pour sa demande d'asile. La SPR s'est demandé s'il serait persécuté en raison de son origine ethnique et de sa religion, mais elle a conclu, avec raison, qu'il ne présentait pas le profil en question et qu'il n'y avait donc pas lieu de croire qu'il serait persécuté. Il revenait au demandeur d'avancer des arguments concernant sa participation à une guerre qui est condamnée par la communauté internationale. Il était raisonnable pour la SPR de ne pas reconnaître qu'il était un véritable objecteur de conscience.
Analyse
[48]
Il convient de noter que, dans cette demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire, le demandeur ne soulevait qu'une seule question, celle de savoir si la SPR s'est fourvoyée dans l'analyse des documents qu'il avait produits, la conduisant de ce fait à tirer des conclusions déraisonnables sur sa crédibilité. Le demandeur n'a pas mentionné la question de ses objections au service militaire dans l'armée turque. Il est donc difficile d'admettre, comme le voudrait le demandeur, que ce motif de persécution ait pu être au départ un élément capital et logique de sa demande d'asile.
[49]
Dans son FRP, le demandeur a écrit ce qui suit:
[traduction] Je crains aussi d'être forcé d'accomplir le service militaire obligatoire. Je m'oppose fermement à mon enrôlement dans l'armée turque, pour de nombreuses raisons. L'armée turque est impliquée, depuis de nombreuses années, dans de graves violations des droits de l'homme commises à l'encontre des populations civiles kurdes, à l'est et au sud-est de la Turquie. Je serai persécuté dans l'armée à cause de mon profil.
[50]
Il me semble que la SPR a examiné les motifs de persécution allégués par le demandeur et qu'elle les a rejetés pour des motifs raisonnables. Elle a pris note de l'affirmation du demandeur selon laquelle il craignait d'être enrôlé dans l'armée. Elle a estimé que son enrôlement était une possibilité, mais constaté qu'il n'avait produit aucun avis de rappel. Le demandeur a expliqué l'absence d'avis de rappel en disant qu'il était exempté du service parce qu'il était à l'université. La SPR a estimé qu'il était possible aussi qu'il eût accompli son service militaire.
[51]
La SPR a aussi relevé que le demandeur avait déclaré à l'audience être un objecteur de conscience, mais elle a rejeté cette affirmation pour des motifs raisonnables. Il avait déclaré dans son FRP qu'il ne souhaitait pas rejoindre l'armée turque parce qu'elle est impliquée dans des violations des droits de la personne contre son propre peuple, les Kurdes, et parce qu'il subirait de mauvais traitements au sein de l'armée, mais il ne prétendait pas dans son FRP être un objecteur de conscience. La SPR n'a pas accepté son explication selon laquelle cela lui avait échappé à l'époque, estimant qu'il s'agirait là d'une raison on ne peut plus convaincante pour laquelle une personne refuserait de faire son service militaire. La SPR y a vu un embellissement du récit du demandeur et a conclu qu'il n'était pas crédible. Fait à noter, compte tenu de ses autres doutes concernant la crédibilité du demandeur, la SPR a déclaré qu'elle n'acceptait pas davantage les raisons qu'avait le demandeur de ne pas vouloir faire son service militaire, estimant qu'il souhaitait tout simplement y échapper.
[52]
Dans la décision
Lebedev,
précitée, le juge de Montigny a confirmé qu'un demandeur d'asile ne peut de manière générale revendiquer le statut de réfugié aux termes de la Convention relative au statut des réfugiés, et donc aux termes de l'article 96 de la LIPR, uniquement parce qu'il ne veut pas servir dans l'armée de son pays. Cependant, il y a trois exceptions à cette règle, à savoir:
i) si la conscription en vue d'un but licite et légitime s'effectue de manière discriminatoire ou si la peine infligée au déserteur est entachée de partialité pour l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention;
ii) si, selon l'opinion politique implicite, le service militaire en question est foncièrement illégitime au regard du droit international;
iii) si des personnes ont des « objections de principe » au service militaire (c'est-à-dire si elles sont des « objecteurs de conscience »).
[53]
L'objection de conscience est le fait de ceux qui s'opposent entièrement à la guerre en raison de leurs convictions politiques, éthiques ou religieuses, et elle soulève des questions d'ordre subjectif. L'objection sélective concerne les cas où un demandeur d'asile s'oppose à une guerre qui, selon lui, va à l'encontre des normes juridiques internationales et des droits de la personne, et ce type d'objection commande une appréciation subjective et objective des faits. Ainsi, le décideur doit non seulement évaluer la sincérité des convictions du demandeur d'asile, mais encore examiner la question de savoir si le conflit en question est objectivement contraire aux normes internationales. Les deux types d'objections doivent être considérés comme deux catégories distinctes.
[54]
Le demandeur, invoquant la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, affirme que la SPR s'est abstenue, à tort, de considérer deux motifs de persécution qu'il avait allégués. Dans ce précédent, une agente des visas n'avait pas pris en compte la crainte du demandeur d'être persécuté pour avoir quitté son pays illégalement. La juge Snider s'est exprimée ainsi:
[103] Le défendeur soutient que, d'après son témoignage, l'agente n'a pas jugé le demandeur crédible et que, de la sorte, elle n'avait pas à examiner tous les motifs de persécution pertinents. Cela serait juste si a) les conclusions quant à la crédibilité étaient raisonnables, et b) si ces conclusions faisaient clairement obstacle à tous les autres motifs de persécution.
[104] Je reconnais que, en général, lorsque est tirée une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité (si elle est raisonnable et prend en compte la preuve), le décideur n'a pas à examiner la demande d'asile plus avant. Si, par exemple, l'agent des visas conclut qu'un demandeur d'asile n'a jamais été emprisonné, il s'ensuit que ne pourra être accueillie la demande de ce dernier fondée sur la crainte d'un retour en prison. Si toutefois le demandeur a mentionné des faits mettant en cause un autre motif de persécution, cet élément de la demande doit toujours être examiné, à moins que l'agent des visas n'ait aussi clairement conclu à son manque de crédibilité.
[...]
[106] Il était loisible à l'agente d'examiner cet autre motif de persécution et de le rejeter; ce n'est toutefois pas ce qu'elle a fait. Elle n'a aucunement expliqué pourquoi elle n'avait pas évalué le risque en cause. Le défendeur demande à la Cour de reconnaître que l'agente n'avait pas à se pencher sur ces autres risques puisqu'elle n'avait pas jugé crédible le récit du demandeur. Ce n'est toutefois pas pour cette raison que l'agente n'a pas examiné ces autres motifs de persécution. Elle n'a pu fournir aucune explication. C'était là une erreur susceptible de contrôle qui justifierait, en soi, l'annulation de la décision de l'agente.
[55]
En l'espèce, et contrairement à l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la SPR a clairement tenu compte de l'affirmation du demandeur selon laquelle il est un objecteur de conscience, pour ensuite rejeter expressément, à cause de ses conclusions d'absence de crédibilité, les autres raisons qu'avait le demandeur de ne pas vouloir servir dans l'armée turque. Il convient aussi de noter qu'une conclusion globale d'absence de crédibilité peut altérer l'ensemble de la preuve produite par un demandeur et finalement entraîner le rejet de la demande d'asile (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[56]
Quoi qu'il en soit, la demande d'asile telle qu'elle a été présentée ne pouvait être admise sur ce motif (décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22). Selon moi, ni le témoignage du demandeur ni la preuve documentaire restreinte qu'il a produite au soutien de sa position n'auraient suffi à établir la profondeur ou la sincérité de ses convictions au point que l'on ne puisse douter qu'il soit un objecteur de conscience ou qu'il serait tenu de participer à des activités militaires jugées contraires aux normes internationales existantes. La preuve ne permettait pas non plus d'établir que, une fois enrôlé, il serait persécuté en raison de son profil. Plus précisément, le demandeur n'a pas montré qu'il entrait dans les exceptions formelles à la règle générale selon laquelle un demandeur d'asile ne peut revendiquer le statut de réfugié simplement parce qu'il ne souhaite pas servir dans l'armée de son pays.
[57]
Pour les motifs susmentionnés, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
