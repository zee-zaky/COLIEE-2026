Jerome, A.C.J.
: These motions concerning the posting of security for the release of the vessel "Hebron Sea" came on for hearing at Toronto, Ontario on April 18, 1994.
[2]
By statement of claim filed March 31, 1994, the plaintiff (PIL) commenced an action against the defendant Secunda Marine Services Ltd. (Secunda), for breach of a contract pursuant to which the plaintiff was to carry out certain construction, repairs, equipping and conversion of the vessel. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached the terms of the contract as a result of which the plaintiff sustained damages in the amount of $1,075,000. The plaintiff claims an order requiring the defendants to submit to arbitration or, in the alternative, damages.
[3]
The plaintiff, pursuant to a warrant issued April 5, 1994, arrested the vessel which was lying at its shipyard in Pictou, Nova Scotia. On April 8, 1994, as a result of an application filed by Secunda in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 43.05, Mr. Justice Saunders ordered PIL to deliver up the "Hebron Sea" to Secunda upon payment into court of $710,227.72 by Secunda. On April 13, 1994 both parties filed notices of motion in this court returnable April 18th. The defendants seek an order releasing the vessel, the "Hebron Sea" without provision of security and payment into court by the plaintiff of security for the defendants' claims in connection with the arbitration proceeding. The plaintiff seeks an order referring the parties to arbitration pursuant to Article 8 of the
Commercial Arbitration Code
, being the Schedule to the
Commercial Arbitration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. 17 (2nd supplement) as amended.
[4]
It is only in very rare cases that in the absence of consent, the court will order the release of an arrested vessel without the posting of security even where the parties are pursuing arbitration of the dispute. The defendants argue that clause 8 of the contract between the parties, which provides that the vessel shall be free from all liens, charges and encumbrances, except only the contractor's liens for any unpaid portion of the contract price applicable to the actual progress, precludes the plaintiff from arresting and seeking security for the release of the vessel. An arrest pursuant to ss. 22(2)(n) and 43(3) of the
Federal Court Act
does not create an encumbrance as contemplated by this paragraph. Rather, it is a procedural remedy which follows an action in rem. However, the amount of security sought by the plaintiff, being $1.5 million, is excessive given the amount of its claim. I am therefore, only prepared to order that the defendants post security in the amount of $800,000, $710,000 of which is to be co-extensive with the security to be posted in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia pursuant to the order of Mr. Justice Saunders.
[5]
The defendants argue that an order should issue requiring the plaintiff to provide security for its claims in arbitration. Having reviewed the pleadings filed to date and the affidavits filed on behalf of the defendants on this motion, I am unable to identify any claims advanced by the defendants against the plaintiff which would justify the issuance of an order requiring the posting of security for the cost of the alleged deficiencies. Furthermore, in a proceeding such as this I am not convinced that the court should exercise its discretion to issue what amounts to a
Mareva
injunction where the specifics of the claims have not been sufficiently identified and there is no indication that the party against whom the order is to be made intends to remove assets for the purpose of defeating the claims. Therefore, no order for security will issue against the plaintiff.
[6]
Both parties have indicated that they wish to proceed to arbitration. Accordingly, pursuant to Article 8 of the
Commercial Arbitration Code
, being the Schedule to the
Commercial Arbitration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. 17 (2nd supplement) the parties are referred to arbitration. Costs in the cause.
Order accordingly.
