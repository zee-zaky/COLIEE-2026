Jerome, A.C.J.
: This matter came on for hearing at Toronto, Ontario, on October 16, 1989. The application seeks a writ of certiorari quashing the respondents' decision to refuse the applicant's request for permanent residence in Canada, and a writ of mandamus directing that the respondents consider and assess the applicant's request for permanent residence in Canada in accordance with the Immigration Act and Immigration Regulations.
Facts
[2]
The applicant, Ranjit Singh Sall, his wife and three children applied for permanent residence in Canada at the Canadian Consulate General in New York, New York, U.S.A., on October 21, 1987. On August 30, 1988 the application was refused because the applicant was considered inadmissible on medical grounds. The relevant part of the letter sent to the applicant reads:
"In the opinion of a medical officer, concurred in by at least one other medical officer, you are suffering from Schizophrenic Disorder - Paranoid type as a result of which you are likely to be a danger to public health or to public safety in Canada. To be more specific, you have a chronic disorder which has a tendency to have exacerbations that is likely to cause excessive demand on health and social services to such an extent that you are considered inadmissible under 19(1)(a)(ii)."
[3]
The applicant was first examined for immigration medical purposes in December 1987 by Dr. P.S. Sunerh of Rexdale, Ontario. Dr. Sunerh prepared a medical report for Canadian immigration and noted that the applicant had suffered "mental disorders". The elaboration on that note reads: "reactive depression March, 87, admitted for three wk. on meds. for a month, felt well, no meds". His conclusion was that the applicant was a "healthy man" whose prognosis was "good".
[4]
A psychiatric report dated March 2, 1988 was prepared by Dr. June Clarke, who treated the applicant in 1987. In this report, Dr. Clarke records that she first saw the applicant on April 3, 1987 for psychiatric assessment and admitted him to Etobicoke General Hospital for treatment. Dr. Clarke writes:
"His emotional disturbance began approximately three weeks prior to admission with insomnia, worrying a lot and bizarre behavior [sic]. The patient became unable to work for two days prior to admission. At the time of admission, he kept his eyes closed much of the time, made unusual gestures with his hands and spoke very little. He could give no historical information, appeared suspicious but said he would 'do whatever his family wanted him to do'."
The applicant was hospitalized for 13 days, and was treated by medication. The letter also states:
"The patient had had one previous episode of illness in England in 1984. He was not hospitalized on this occasion but was treated with chlorpromazine at home and was off work a total of approximately ten weeks."
According to Dr. Clarke, these events were "two brief, mild episodes of a psychiatric disturbance ... which responded quickly to medication". Dr. Clarke last saw the applicant on February 26, 1988, at which time he is described as being
"a pleasant, cooperative thirty-two year old mechanical draftsman. He showed no evidence of thought disorder, problems with mood, concentration, or unusual behaviour."
Dr. Clarke ends the letter saying that Mr. Sall "is a well motivated cooperative person who shows no evidence of illness at present".
[5]
A hospital discharge summary signed by Dr. Clarke and dated May 13, 1987, relating to the applicant's April 1987 stay in hospital was also sent to Dr. Bernstein. In this document, Dr. Clarke wrote the following comments:
"Final Diagnosis:
Schizophrenic Disorder,
Paranoid Type
Exacerbation
"The patient was brought to hospital by his relatives, having had weird behaviour and insomnia, worrying, etc., for approximately three weeks prior to admission. There was a prior history of psychiatric illness in England and some suspiciousness over the period since he emigrated from England in August of 1986.
"On mental status examination, the patient was not too cooperative with the initial examination, but yawned and made unusual gestures with his hands. Speech was often muttered. No information was obtainable. He often appeared annoyed, but said he would do 'whatever his family wanted to do' and denied problems of any kind. Affect was suspicious and angry. Memory and orientation was not satisfactorily assessed."
Dr. Clarke's assessment was that the physical tests showed results in normal ranges, that the applicant showed improvement and was discharged in good condition with medication.
[6]
On May 19, 1988, the applicant was designated "M-7" by Drs. Bernstein, M.J. Ferrari, Assistant Director, Immigration Medicine (Assessments), and others on the Health and Welfare staff. The summary of their conference states:
"35 year old man with reactive depression on treatment. Further for psychiatric report. Bizarre behaviour, insomnia etc. One previous episode in 1984 in England. Off work 10 weeks; again in 1987. Paranoid schizophrenia. M7 - agreed."
On May 25, 1988, Dr. Bernstein signed a Medical Notification which contains a Narrative stating:
"Schizophrenic Disorder - Paranoid type
Has a chronic disorder which has a tendency to have exacerbations that is likely to cause excessive demandoon [sic] health and social services to such an extent that applicant is considered inadmissible under 19(1)(a)(ii)."
Dr. Ferrari concurred in this opinion.
[7]
Upon learning of this the applicant's solicitor wrote on October 12th to both Dr. Ferrari and Dr. Clarke. The letter to Dr. Ferrari requested that the matter be reviewed on the basis of Dr. Clark's assessment. The one to Dr. Clarke requested a written opinion, a portion of which follows:
"On further review of this case I believe the diagnosis on the discharge summary of Etobicoke General Hospital was hasty and inaccurate. On my report to Dr. Bernstein I did not specify a diagnosis; however, on reviewing the presentation and course of his illness would believe a DSM III diagnosis of schizophreniform Disorder 295.40 was most accurate.
"Therefore, it is not likely in my opinion that he would cause an excessive demand on health and social services insofar as it is possible to predict these things."
[8]
Diagnostic Criteria From DSM-III-R, referred to in Dr. Clark's letter above, is a publication of the American Psychiatric Association. It is the revised third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, dated 1987. For present purposes the following excerpt from pp. 113-114 and 122 will suffice:
"295.xxSchizophrenia
A. Presence of characteristic psychotic symptoms in the active phase: either (1), (2) or (3) for at least one week (unless the symptoms are successfully treated);
(1) two of the following:
(a) delusions
(b) prominent hallucinations (throughout the day for several days, or several times a week for several weeks, each hallucinatory experience not being limited to a few brief moments)
(c) incoherence or marked loosening of associations
(d) catatonic behaviour
(e) flat or grossly inappropriate affect
(2) bizarre delusions (i.e., involving a phenomenon that the person's culture would regard as totally implausible, e.g., thought broadcasting, being controlled by a dead person)
(3) prominent hallucinations (as defined in (1)(b) above) of a voice with content having no apparent relation to depression or elation, or a voice keeping up a running commentary on the person's behaviour or thoughts, or two or more voices conversing with each other
C. Schizoaffective Disorder and Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features have been ruled out, i.e., if a Major Depressive or Manic Syndrome has ever been present during an active phase of the disturbance, the total duration of al episodes of a mood syndrome has been brief relative to the total duration of the active and residual phases of the disturbance.
"295.40 Schizophreniform Disorder
A. Meets criteria A and C of Schizophrenia (p. 113 and 114).
B. An episode of the disturbance (including prodromal, active, and residual phases) lasts less than six months. (When the diagnosis must be made without waiting for recovery, it should be qualified as 'provisional'.)
C. Does not meet the criteria for Brief Reactive Psychosis, and it cannot be established that an organic factor initiated and maintained the disturbance."
This letter was transmitted to the immigration officials, who reviewed it. Dr. Bernstein, in his affidavit, explains that in his opinion the applicant does not match the description of s. 295.40, since the applicant experienced mental problems for longer than six months. He does not agree with the assessment made by Dr. Clarke in her letter of October 14, 1988.
[9]
The medical officers reviewed the applicant's case on November 30, 1988 and a summary of that meeting dated December 1, 1988, shows that they concluded that their original decision assessing the applicant as M7 would stand. This was communicated to the Consulate in New York by letter dated December 20, 1988, signed by Dr. Bernstein, which reads in part:
"There is agreement that the original decision, wherein the applicant was categorized as M5 on May 25, 1988, still stands."
M5 is a less serious level of medical admissibility. Clearly, the reference to it here was simply a typographical error and nothing turns upon it.
[10]
The Consulate wrote the applicant's solicitor on February 8, 1989, informing him that "the decision to refuse Mr. Sal's [sic] application for permanent residence remains unchanged". The applicant now seeks judicial review of the refusal.
Argument
[11]
The applicant argues that the respondents have failed or refused to properly and reasonably assess the medical evidence before them, and thereby incorrectly arrived at the conclusion that the applicant is medically inadmissible.
[12]
The respondent argues that the diagnosis was properly made by the medical officers, based on the reports submitted to them by Drs. Sunerh and Clarke. The opinion of the medical officers, that the applicant was suffering from a medical condition and that the consequence of such a condition could place an excessive burden on the health and social services of Canada, so long as it was reasonable at the time it was given, may properly be relied on by a visa officer. Therefore, the refusal of the application was proper in law.
Law
[13]
The applicable provisions of the Immigration Act, 1976, S.C. 1976-77, c. 52, are ss. 8(1) and 19(1)(a) (now R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, ss. 8(1) and 19(1)(a)) which read:
"8(1) Where a person seeks to come into Canada, the burden of proving that he has a right to come into Canada or that his admission would not be contrary to this Act or the regulations rests on him.
"19(1) No person shall be granted admission if he is a member of any of the following classes:
(a) persons who are suffering from any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer,
(i) they are or are likely to be a danger to public health of to public safety, or
(ii) their admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services;"
[14]
Regulation 22 of the Immigration Regulations, 1978, is also relevant here. It reads:
"22. For the purpose of determining whether any person is or is likely to be a danger to public health or to public safety or whether the admission of any person would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services, the following factors shall be considered by a medical officer in relation to the nature, severity or probable duration of any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment from which the person is suffering, namely,
(a) any reports made by a medical practitioner with respect to the person.
(b) the degree to which the disease, disorder, disability or other impairment may be communicated to other persons;
(c) whether medical surveillance is required for reasons of public health;
(d) whether sudden incapacity or unpredictable or unusual behaviour may create a danger to public safety;
(e) whether the supply of health or social services that the person may require in Canada is limited to such an extent that
(i) the use of such services by the person might reasonably be expected to prevent or delay provision of those services to Canadian citizens or permanent residents, or
(ii) the use of such services may not be available or accessible to the person;
(f) whether medical care or hospitalization is required;
(g) whether potential employability or productivity is affected, and
(h) whether prompt and effective medical treatment can be provided. SOR/78-316, s. 2."
Jurisprudence
[15]
The issues in cases of this sort were recently canvassed in two very instructive decisions in our court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) where an application for landing was refused under s. 19(1)(a) (ii), Mr. Justice Hugessen for the majority writes (at 98 (F.C.), 222 (N.R.)):
"It is therefore open to an appellant to show that the medical officers' opinion was unreasonable and this may be done by the production of evidence from medical witnesses other than 'medical officers'. However, evidence that simply tends to show that the person concerned is no longer suffering from the medical condition which formed the basis of the medical officers' opinion is clearly not enough; the medical officers may well have been wrong in their prognosis but so long as the person concerned was suffering from the medical condition and their opinion as to its consequences was reasonable at the time it was given and relied on by the visa officer, the latter's refusal of the sponsored application was well founded. In my view, therefore, the Board's ruling to this effect was right."
More recently, my colleague Pinard, J., in the very similar factual situation of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 66 (F.C.T.D.) said at pp. 73 and 74:
"There is no doubt that the decision challenged by the applicant is a purely administrative one. There is also no doubt that a decision of this type remains fully subject to judicial review, and its validity in law will depend of factors of a jurisdictional and procedural nature.
"In jurisdictional terms, the question is whether the decision was made by a duly constituted authority acting without abuse of power, that is in good faith, with objectivity, for reasons and in a way which may have been defined by the Act. In the case at bar, I consider that these conditions have been met. The immigration officer was undoubtedly the duly constituted authority to make the decision pursuant to s. 6 of the Refugee Claims Backlog Regulations. As that officer had before her a medical notification meeting the requirements of s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Act, after Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska, who claimed landing in Canada, had been duly referred to the examining physician for a medical examination for immigration purposes, she no longer had any discretion and had no alternative but to find the applicants, husband and wife, inadmissible.
"As to whether the diagnosis stated in the medical notification in question is accurate and fully supports the opinion of the physicians who signed it, these are questions of fact and not of law (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). If the applicant had been able to show that entries or notations in the medical notification were so inconsistent with each other that they made the document as a whole incoherent, then of course such a medical notification could not constitute the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). However, that is not the case here. The medical notification is clear and its content quite coherent as regards the medical record consulted by Dr. Robert W. Beaulieu and the explanations given by him."
Conclusions
[16]
Unfortunately for the applicant, there is nothing here to persuade me that there was any error in the diagnosis of Drs. Bernstein and Ferrari, nor in the process by which they arrived at their opinions. Those conclusions are set out in the affidavit of Dr. Bernstein who indicates that they reviewed the letter of Dr. Clarke of March 2, 1988 and the discharge summary of April 30, 1987, the report of the applicant's family physician, Dr. Sunerh December 8, 1987, and laboratory tests and radiological report referred to by Dr. Sunerh. On the basis of these documents, Dr. Bernstein reached the opinion that the applicant was medically inadmissible and presented his opinion to a conference of four other medical officers in May 1988. The opinion was confirmed as was the conclusion that since the applicant had a spouse and family to support, potential for recurrent hospitalization and deteriorating employability, exacerbations from his disorder would cause excessive demands on health and social services.
[17]
The primary evidence offered to contradict those conclusions was that of the applicant's own psychiatrist, Dr. Clarke. Dr. Clarke's discharge summary May 13, 1987 would appear to me to be entirely consistent and perhaps supportive of the conclusions reached by the doctors who made the assessment on behalf of the Minister. The only opinion to the contrary is Dr. Clarke's later letter in which she seeks to depart from her initial diagnosis and suggest a less serious assessment. The fact that Dr. Clarke's two opinions seem to be somewhat in conflict with each other, of course, weakens the attack on the conclusions reached by Drs. Bernstein and Ferrari, but in any event, at the request of counsel, they reviewed the file, including Dr. Clarke's second opinion and agreed that they should not change their initial assessment.
[18]
Neither the facts nor the law in the circumstances of this case would justify the relief sought and the application must be dismissed. I make no order as to costs, but in fairness to the respondent, I will do so without prejudice to the right of the Minister to make a separate application for costs within 30 days.
Application dismissed.
