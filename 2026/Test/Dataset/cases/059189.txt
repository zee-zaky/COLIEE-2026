Teitelbaum, J.
: This is a motion against the defendants Dien-Dan, Dat Le and Phuong Le to show cause why "each should not be committed to the common jail and/or required to pay a fine" for breaching an order of the Associate Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Canada made on May 25, 1987.
[2]
Plaintiff, Profekta International Inc. (Profekta) commenced legal proceedings against a number of defendants, one of whom is the present defendant Dien-Dan, on the 13th day of May 1987, for infringement of copyrights that Profekta claims it is the owner of.
[3]
After the filing of the statement of claim on the 13th day of May 1987, Profekta obtained, on May 25, 1987, an interim injunction "until disposition of the motion for interlocutory relief" ordering:
"1. The Plaintiff's motion for an order granting an interlocutory injunction, until the final disposition of this matter, to restrain each of the Defendants, individually and by its directors, officers, employees, servants and agents, and all others over whom it exercises control, and all those having knowledge of this order, from:
1. reproducing any of the dramatic works fixed in video cassette tapes as listed in Appendices A, B and C herein;
2. selling, leasing, renting, offering to sell, offering to lease, offering to rent, exhibiting, distributing and importing any copy of any of the dramatic works fixed in video cassette tapes as listed in Appendices A, B and C herein;
be heard at the Federal Court of Canada, 330 University Avenue, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on Thursday, June 18, 1987 at the hour of ten o'clock in the forenoon;
"2. A copy of this Order be served on each Defendant together with a copy of the Notice of Motion respecting the motion for interlocutory relief referred to in paragraph 1 above;
"3. Each of the Defendants, except the Defendant Wah Fund Ltd., individually and by its directors, officers, employees, servants and agents, and all others over whom it exercises control, and all those having knowledge of this order is hereby restrained, until disposition of the motion for interlocutory refief referred to in paragraph 1 above, from:
(1) reproducing any of the dramatic works fixed in video cassette tapes as listed in Appendices A, B and C herein; and
(2) selling, leasing, renting, offering to sell, offering to lease, offering to rent, exhibiting, distributing and importing any copy of any of the dramatic works fixed in video cassette tapes as listed in Appendices A, B and C herein; and ..."
[4]
I have not included the list of titles to be found in Appendices A, B and C. Suffice it to state that the title "The Dragon Sword" is contained in Appendix "A".
[5]
The order of the Associate Chief Justice requires that his order be served on the defendant Dien-Dan.
[6]
On June 2, 1987, the order, as issued by the Associate Chief Justice, was served on the defendant Dien-Dan. The affidavit of Donald Belcher states:
"1. That I did on June 2, 1987 personally serve Dien-Dan with a true copy of the Order in this matter, hereunto annexed and marked as Exhibit 'A', by delivering such copy to and leaving same with Phuong Le the Manager and person in charge at 1590 Dundas Street West., Toronto, Ontario."
[7]
Phuong Le has given evidence before me that she is not only the "Manager and person in charge" but is also the sole owner of Dien-Dan, an unincorporated business.
[8]
On June 8, 1987, Profekta, presented to the Federal Court, Trial Division, a notice of motion wherein a request is being made ex parte, for a show cause order pursuant to rule 355 of the Federal Court Rules as "the defendants Dien-Dan, Dat Le and Phuong Le" contravened the terms of the interim injunction order.
[9]
Neither Dat Le or Phuong Le are named defendants in the statement of claim issued by Profekta. Phuong Le admits to being the sole proprietor of the business known as Dien-Dan.
[10]
The breach of the interim injunction that is alleged against Dien-Dan, Dat Le and Phuong Le is to be seen in paragraphs 3 and 4 of an affidavit sworn to on June 5, 1987 by a Mr. Vu Anh Pham.
"3. I asked the saleslady if Dien-Dan rented HK-TVB tapes. She said yes. The saleslady then showed me a book that had listed about twenty HK-TVB tapes available for rental. Included in the list of tapes available for rent from Dien-Dan were:
1. 'The Dragon Sword'
2. 'The Turbulent Decade'
3. 'The Master of Shaolin'
4. 'When Silken Hands Get Rough'
5. 'Destiny'
"4. I selected the tape 'The Dragon Sword' and did rent the tape entitled 'Thien Long Than Kiem' from Dien-Dan on Friday afternoon, June 5, 1987. Marked and shown to me as Exhibit A to this my affidavit is the tape which I rented from Dien-Dan."
[11]
On June 8, 1987, the Associate Chief Justice issued a show cause order against "The defendants Dien-Dan, Dat Le and Phuong Le" and ordered each one of them to appear at the Federal Court on June 18, 1987.
[12]
The hearing scheduled for June 18, 1987, was postponed to June 29, 1987.
Elements of the Offence of Contempt
[13]
The elements of the offence of contempt are set out in rule 355(1) of the Federal Court Rules, which states:
"Rule 355. Contempt in Relation to Court
"(1) Anyone is guilty of contempt of court who disobeys any process or order of the Court or a judge thereof, or who acts in such a way as to interfere with the orderly administration of justice, or to impair the authority or dignity of the Court. In particular, any officer of justice who fails to do his duty, and any sheriff or bailiff who does not execute a writ forthwith or does not make a return thereof or, in executing it, infringes any rule the whereof renders him liable to a penalty, is guilty of contempt of court."
[14]
Therefore, in the case at bar, there must be, on the persons charged with contempt, disobedience to the order of the Court issued by the Associate Chief Justice on the 25th day of May 1987.
[15]
The disobedience by the persons charged with contempt must be deliberate or willful. It must be done knowingly, that is, with full knowledge of the existence and terms of the injunction ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Standard of Proof Required
[16]
I am of the belief that the standard of proof required for contempt proceedings, whether the case is one of civil or criminal contempt, is proof beyond a reasonable doubt ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.)).
[17]
It therefore follows that for me to find Dien-Dan, Dat Le and Phuong Le in contempt of Court of the order of the Associate Chief Justice of May 25, 1987, Profekta must convince me, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Dat Le and Phuong Le or either one of them have so acted as to have committed a breach of the order.
[18]
The proof that must be filed, in order for Profekta to convince me beyond a reasonable doubt that an act of contempt was committed must be by direct evidence. Hearsay evidence is not admissible.
[19]
If affidavit evidence is made, as it was made in the case at bar, the material must set out facts which are known to the deponent and any affidavit evidence based on hearsay is not admissible ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.)).
[20]
It will thus be seen that a part of the evidence contained in the affidavits of Teresa Kinghan and of Vo Thanh (tabs 4 and 7 of Profekta's Motion Record) is invalid as being hearsay evidence.
Who May Be Found In Contempt And For What Acts
[21]
In the present case, Profekta, in its Motion, requests that I find Dien-Dan, Dat Le and Phuong Le in contempt of Court.
[22]
Only Dien-Dan is listed as a defendant in the proceedings commenced by Profekta. In the order given by the Associate Chief Justice on May 25, 1987, only Dien-Dan is listed as a defendant.
[23]
Phuong Le gave evidence that she, and only she, is the proprietor of the business known as Dien-Dan. That the business known as Dien-Dan is not an incorporated business.
[24]
A defendant who actually breaches an injunction by doing the prohibited act will be found guilty of contempt of Court. A defendant may also be in contempt of Court in aiding in the commission of a breach of the injunction or inciting another to commit such a breach ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  breach of an injunction, unless, with the knowledge of the injunction, they chose to interfere, to step into the place of the person who is named and commit the act enjoined, in which case such a person may be found in contempt of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  claim of contempt against the present defendant, Phuong Le, did Profekta prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she contravened the terms of the injunction?
[27]
In relation to the claim of contempt against the defendant Dat Le, did Profekta prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he willfully, purposely and knowingly aided and abetted Phuong Le, his wife, to contravene the terms of the injunction.
[28]
The evidence produced by Profekta together with the evidence made by Phuong Le at the hearing, leaves me no alternative but to answer in the negative.
[29]
The only breach of the interim injunction of May 25, 1987, alleged by Profekta to have been committed is to be found in the affidavit of Vu Anh Pham of June 5, 1987. The affidavit is to be found under Tab 5, Profekta's motion record.
[30]
For the purpose of this case, I believe it necessary to reproduce Vu Anh Pham's affidavit.
"I, VU ANH PHAM, of 124 Tyndall Avenue, Apt. 101, Toronto, Ontario, make oath and say as follows:
1. On Friday June 5, 1987, at about 1:30 in the afternoon, I attended at the premises of Dien-Dan at 1590 Dundas Street West in Toronto.
2. I had not previously rented tapes from Dien-Dan before this visit. Therefore, I took out a membership for rental of tapes from Dien-Dan.
3. I asked the saleslady if Dien-Dan rented HK-TVB tapes. She said yes. The saleslady then showed me a book that had listed about twenty HK-TVB tapes available for rental. Included in the list of tapes available for rent from Dien-Dan were:
1. 'The Dragon Sword'
2. 'The Turbulent Decade'
3. 'The Master of Shaolin'
4. 'When Silken Hands Get Rough'
5. 'Destiny'
4. I selected the tape 'The Dragon Sword' and did rent the tape entitled "Thien Long Than Kiem" from Dien-Dan on Friday afternoon, June 5, 1987. Marked and shown to me as Exhibit A to this my affidavit is the tape which I rented from Dien-Dan.
5. The English translation of the Vietnamese title 'Thien Long Than Kiem' is 'The Dragon Sword'."
[31]
Counsel for Profekta informed me that the only evidence that he wished to submit for my consideration is the affidavit of Vu Anh Pham, above reproduced, the affidavit of Vo Thanh and the affidavit of Teresa Kinghan.
[32]
The affidavit of Teresa Kinghan is to be found under Tab 4 of Profekta's motion record while Vo Thanh's affidavit is to be found under Tab 7.
[33]
A copy of the order of the Associate Chief Justice made on May 25, 1987, in which Dien-Dan is listed as a defendant was served on Dien-Dan on the 2nd day of June 1987. The order was served upon Phuong Le (see affidavit of Donald Belcher, Tab 3).
[34]
Not a shred of evidence was made before me that Dat Le was either a defendant in the present proceedings or that he had, with knowledge of the injunction, chosen to interfere, or step into the place of his wife, Phuong Le, and commit the act enjoined.
[35]
The only evidence given concerning Dat Le was given by his wife Phuong Le in her examination in chief and in her cross-examination.
[36]
My understanding of Phuong Le's evidence regarding her husband, and I would state that I had a great deal of difficulty understanding her evidence as she speaks very little English and no interpreter was present, is that he had his own job, that she is the only person who, with very rare exception, would work in the store as the salesperson. That her husband was present, on May 25, 1987, with her when the Associate Chief Justice granted the interim injunction.
[37]
Phuong Le also testified that although she gave the documents that were served on her to her husband Dat Le, he simply looked at the papers and told her to send them "to the lawyer". She states that she sometimes discusses her business with her husband and that he "just sometimes he help me buy the movie".
[38]
I am satisfied that from the evidence made before me Dat Le did not understand, on June 5, 1987, the full meaning of the interim injunction issued on May 25, 1987, nor did he commit or help commit any act in contravention of the order.
[39]
As I have stated, I am satisfied that Profekta failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Phuong Le committed any act in contravention of the terms of the interim injunction.
[40]
In that Phuong Le was present at the hearing before the Associate Chief Justice on May 25, 1987, I am satisfied she understood, generally speaking, that the Associate Chief Justice issued an order forbidding her (Dien-Dan) from dealing with certain types of video cassette tapes.
[41]
In Phuong Le's examination in chief she admits to having understood "what the judge said". She also states that immediately after the May 25, 1987 hearing, as she left the Court room, counsel for Profekta told her not to rent the prohibited tapes.
[42]
As previously stated, the only breach alleged to have been committed by Phuong Le is that three days after being served with the order of the Associate Chief Justice, she, on June 5, 1987, rented a video cassette tape entitled "Thien Long Than Kiem" (The Dragon Sword) to one Vu Anh Pham and that this video cassette tape is one of the HK-TVB video tapes which is listed on Appendix "A" forming part of the interim injunction issued herein.
[43]
Vu Anh Pham submits, in his affidavit of June 5, 1987, that he attended the premises of Dien-Dan and rented the film in question.
[44]
To corroborate Vu Anh Pham's evidence, Profekta filed the affidavit of Vo Thanh.
[45]
It is interesting to note that Vo Thanh states that he "make oath and say ... I make this affidavit based on my own knowledge".
[46]
I assume that Vo Thanh makes this statement to show that his evidence is not based on hearsay.
[47]
Immediately after making this statement, he states:
"2. On June 5, 1987, I went to the premises of the Defendant Dien-Dan at 1590 Dundas Street West, in Toronto with Vu Anh Pham. I did not go inside the store because Phuong Le would recognize me as I have met with her previously as a sales representative of the Plaintiff.
"3. I looked through the window at the Dien-Dan premises and saw Vu Anh Pham rent a video cassette tape from Phuong Le.
"4. When Vu Anh Pham came out of the Dien-Dan premises he showed me the tape he had just rented and it was the tape that is marked and now shown to me as Exhibit A to the Exhibit of Vu Anh Pham sworn to on June 5, 1987."
[48]
Having remained outside the premises of Dien-Dan, I doubt that he was in a position to have seen Vu Anh Pham rent a video cassette tape from Phuong Le. Vo Thanh may have seen Vu Anh Pham being given a video cassette tape but he could not, being outside, know if Vu Anh Pham rented the tape in question.
[49]
Unless Vo Thanh was told by Vu Anh Pham that the tape was a rented one, he could not make this statement. Not being present when the transaction between Vu Anh Pham and Phuong Le took place, this evidence of rental is hearsay.
[50]
Therefore the evidence as to the renting of the video cassette tape contained in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Vo Thanh's affidavit is hearsay evidence and is inadmissible.
[51]
The only evidence that Phuong Le rented out a video cassette tape that she was under an interim injunction not to do is found in Vu Anh Pham's affidavit.
[52]
Phuong Le, both in her examination in chief and in her cross-examination denies that she ever owned the tape nor that she rented the tape to Vu Anh Pham.
[53]
The video cassette tape that Vu Anh Pham allegedly rented from Phuong Le was filed as Exhibit "A" with his affidavit.
[54]
Phuong Le explained, in detail, the procedure she adopts when a customer, who is not a friend or neighbour, rents a video cassette tape. She states that if it is a new customer, on the back of her business card she writes certain information of the customer and gives this card to the customer. This card becomes a "Membership card".
[55]
After completing the card, she prepares an invoice, white original with a yellow copy, upon which she writes certain information as to when the film was rented, to whom it was rented, etc.
[56]
This is done to enable her to have a record as to which customer rented a particular video tape and, by using this method, she can verify if a film has been returned. She states that if a film is not returned within a certain delay, she can then contact the customer.
[57]
Phuong Le gave evidence to the fact that she never contacted Vu Anh Pham requesting the return of the video cassette tape which Pham claims to have rented from her.
[58]
All such invoices are numerically numbered.
[59]
Phuong Le produced but did not file all yellow copies of rentals made by her from June 1, 1987 to June 10, 1987. These invoices were numbered 3930 to 3982 inclusively. No invoice was missing. For June 5, 1987, the witness stated she leased eight video cassettes. Not one of the invoices was made out to Vu Anh Pham.
[60]
In examining the affidavit of Vu Anh Pham, it is evident that he does not claim to have received such an invoice but does claim that he was given a membership card which was filed as Exhibit P-1.
[61]
Pham states that he had never rented any tapes from Dien-Dan before June 5, 1987.
[62]
I find it extremely difficult to believe that a person who rents a video cassette tape for the first time, and is not known to Phuong Le, would be allowed to take the video cassette tape without obtaining a receipt nor without giving some kind of acknowledgement that he is taking possession of the tape.
[63]
If the tape were not to be returned, no proof could be made that it was taken out by anyone. There would be no proof of ownership and Phuong Le would lose any claim to the video cassette tape.
[64]
Furthermore, Vu Anh Pham was sent to Phuong Le's premises specifically to gather evidence that she was committing an act forbidden by the terms of the interim injunction. Surely he would have asked for a receipt to clearly show that Phuong Le committed a breach of the interim injunction.
[65]
Counsel for Profekta submits that Pham obtained a membership card and that this tends to give credibility to Pham's affidavit evidence.
[66]
There is no doubt that Pham obtained a membership card. Phuong Le testified that on numerous occasions persons came into her premises, "look around" and then asked for a membership without making any rental as membership is free.
[67]
Nothing on the membership card indicates that it was obtained on June 5, 1987.
[68]
I am fully satisfied with Phuong Le's explanation.
[69]
Phuong Le examined the video cassette tape filed as Exhibit "A" and declared that the tape did not come from her premises. She denied ever having the said video cassette tape.
[70]
She states that had the cassette come from her store, she would be able to recognize the cassette as her own.
[71]
In cross-examination, Phuong Le stated that she never rented HK-TVB video cassette tapes, nor did she ever have such tapes.
[72]
She was contradicted as to this evidence by Joseph Hui, President of Profekta. He stated, in rebuttal evidence, on the issue of Phuong Le's credibility, that he had attended at the premises of Phuong Le on four or five occasions and, on each occasion, was able to see HK-TVB video cassette tapes.
[73]
This may be so, but the evidence is contradictory.
[74]
After having heard the testimony of Phuong Le, and after having watched her give testimony, I find it impossible to understand the statement of Teresa Kinghan contained in paragraph 6 of her affidavit wherein she states:
"6. Phuong Le said that she understood all of this. It appeared to me that Phuong Le understood English quite well."
[75]
My impression is that Phuong Le has a serious difficulty in understanding English. She has a greater difficulty in speaking the English language.
[76]
In examining the evidence filed, including the affidavit of Teresa Kinghan, and made in the present case, the plaintiff, Profekta, failed to establish that the defendant Phuong Le (Dien-Dan) committed a breach of the interim injunction of May 25, 1987 on the 5th day of June 1987. Nor is there any evidence that a breach of the order was committed on any other day.
[77]
The present motion is dismissed with costs.
Motion dismissed.
