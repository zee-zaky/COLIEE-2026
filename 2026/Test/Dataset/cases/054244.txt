Rothstein, J.
: This is a judicial review of a June 27, 1996 decision of visa officer, Ellen Yachnin refusing to issue permanent resident visas to the applicant and his dependents on the grounds that the applicant's infant son was medically inadmissible under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
. The applicant's arguments may be summarized as follows:
1. The medical officer's report was inconsistent and therefore invalid and was wrongly relied upon by the visa officer, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), per Heald, J., at page 13.
2. The applicant was not given a fair opportunity to know what information to provide to the visa officer with respect to the infant's condition.
3. In view of the delay from the time when the applicant was first offered the opportunity to provide medical information about his infant son, the visa officer erred in not allowing him the opportunity to provide updated medical information.
4. The visa officer did not determine whether the applicant's infant son would cause excessive demands on health services in accordance with s. 22 of the
Immigration Regulations
.
[2]
A medical notification dated November 27, 1995, by Medical Officer, Dr. Gordon Hutchings concurred in by another medical officer, Dr. T. Axler contained the following narrative with respect to the baby:
"DIAGNOSIS
BILIARY ATRESIA ICD 751
"This applicant suffered from the congenital anomaly biliary atresia. Surgical correction in the form of a Kasai operation was performed when the child was 104 days old. However published medical evidence indicates that his condition will deteriorate and that he will suffer progressive liver damage. His continued care and treatment would require extensive medical resources and likely recurrent hospitalizations. This will cause excessive demands on health services and he is therefore inadmissible under Section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
.
He also has:
1) G6PD deficiency
2) S.P respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis with seizures"
[3]
On November 28, 1995 this medical notification was sent to the applicant with a covering letter advising that it appeared the baby would be medically inadmissible to Canada and inviting the applicant to provide, within 30 days, any further information considered relevant, failing which the application for visas would be refused. Copies of the relevant portions of the
Immigration Act
were also provided to the applicant.
[4]
The applicant had retained an immigration consultant. The consultant forwarded to the visa officer a letter dated December 22nd, 1995 from Dr. K.L. Chan, senior medical officer in the Department of Surgery at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, which states inter alia:
"Operative cholangiogram and Kasai operation were done on 28 September 1995 by the Division of Paediatric Surgery at the Queen Mary Hospital. The operation was performed uneventfully and the bilirubin level returned to normal gradually Postoperative EHIDA scan on 13 November 1995 showed normal biliary drainage to the small bowel. Currently he is jaundice free and thriving well. According to our institution's operation experience at the University of Hong Kong in managing patients with biliary atresia, the success rate of Kasai operation is about 50%. Au Wing Chun belong to the successful group and normal hepatobiliary function is expected postoperatively."
[5]
For some reason, this letter was not brought to Dr. Hutchings' attention immediately and it was not until April 23rd, 1996 that he reviewed the letter. Dr. Hutchings says he considered the letter but after discussing the matter with Dr. Axler, both considered their original assessment to be valid. The visa officer was informed of this finding.
[6]
On or about May 30, 1996, Dr. Hutchings called a surgeon to consult further on the matter. The surgeon was of the opinion that it was too early to predict whether the long-term outcome of the surgery would be successful. Dr. Hutchings reviewed this information again with Dr. Axler and they again concluded that their original assessment was still valid.
[7]
On June 10, 1996, the visa officer met with Dr. Hutchings to discuss the case. Again, Dr. Hutchings confirmed that after reviewing the medical information provided by the applicant, Dr. Axler and he were still of the same opinion.
[8]
On June 27, 1996, the visa officer wrote the applicant advising that the application for permanent residence visas was refused.
[9]
First, I cannot agree with applicant's counsel that the medical report was inconsistent. Based on published medical evidence, Dr. Hutchings and Dr. Axler formed the opinion that the infant's condition would deteriorate and that he would suffer progressive liver damage. These doctors were not obliged to accept the opinion of the infant's doctor that the success rate of the Kasai operation is about 50% or that the infant belonged to the successful group. Indeed, the surgeon consulted by Dr. Hutchings said it was too early to tell if the infant would do well. Further, while applicant's counsel would like me to infer that the surgeon found there was a 50% success rate for the Kasai operation, I am unable to go that far. All that I am able to infer is that the surgeon was of the opinion it was too early to tell if the infant would do well.
[10]
It does appear that the visa officer, when faced with medical reports suggesting differing prognoses discussed the matter again with Dr. Hutchings, at which time he confirmed the original opinion of himself and Dr. Axler. The visa officer appears to have carefully considered the matter and did all that was required of her with respect to the medical report, which caused her to reject the applicant's visa application. I see no inconsistency in the medical report and no error by the visa officer in this respect.
[11]
The invitation to provide further information was not vague. Indeed, the applicant responded to the invitation with relevant medical information. That the information provided may not have persuaded the medical officers that the baby was "out of the woods" does not indicate that it was not responsive to the issue at hand. I am convinced the applicant knew what was at issue and responded accordingly. Nor does the evidence indicate the applicant was not given a fair opportunity to provide updated medical information. While there appears to have been some administrative difficulty that caused delay in processing the applicant's application, there is no evidence of refusal to consider further information. Indeed, the applicant's consultant wrote to the visa officer on June 6, 1996 referring to a further medical report submitted on behalf of the applicant in late May, 1996. However, no such letter was received, and applicant's counsel could provide no further information with respect to it. I have not been made aware of any authority that would oblige the visa officer to obtain or ask the applicant to submit updated medical information because of the delay that ensued. While nothing prevents the visa officer from seeking such a report or the applicant from providing further information, there is no legal obligation on the visa officer to do so. Nor is there any indication in the evidence that it was unreasonable for the medical officers to confirm their opinion as to the baby's prognosis without further information. The evidence suggests that the baby's long-term prospects would not be determined from an updated report.
[12]
Finally, I see no error with respect to the assessment of whether the applicant's infant son would cause excessive demand on health services. Section 22 of the
Immigration Regulations
has been determined to be not applicable to the determination of whether the admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health and social services.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at 145 per Cullen, J. Accordingly s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
is to be interpreted without regard for s. 22 of the
Regulations
for this purpose. Section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
provides:
"19(1) No persons shall be granted admission who is a member of any of the following classes:
(a) Persons who are suffering from any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer,
(i) ...
(ii) their admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services;"
[13]
Section 19(1)(a)(ii) contemplates a discretionary decision by a medical officer based upon relevant information. What was relevant to the medical officer in this case was the expectation that the infant's condition would deteriorate and that he would suffer progressive liver damage requiring extensive medical resources and recurrent hospitalization, which in his view would cause excessive demand on health services. In
Fei
, supra, it appears that necessary and relevant information was not before the medical officers for them to make a decision that admission of the applicant in that case would result in excessive demands on health and social services. In this case, the medical officers had medical reports respecting the infant and published medical evidence as to his likely prognosis and they therefore had information upon which to arrive at the conclusion that admission of the applicant's infant son would cause excessive demand on health services.
[14]
Applicant's counsel, relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 85 (F.C.A.), submits that in view of the medial report of the infant's doctor that the Kasai operation had a 50% success rate, it is not possible to say there is a
probability
of excessive demand on health services in Canada. However, as I have earlier said, it was not incumbent on the medical officers to agree with the infant's doctor as to a 50% success rate. They were of the view, based on published medical evidence, that the infant's condition would deteriorate. It was open to them to come to that conclusion and that is a sufficient basis to take this case outside the purview of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . I am satisfied that the medical report in this case was in conformity with s. 19(1)(a)(ii).
[15]
The judicial review is dismissed.
[16]
I would add this. The evidence before me does not allow me to say when it may be determined if the infant is indeed in the group that does well from Kasai surgery, and whether a condition different from that reached in this case might be possible in the future. However it is obvious that the baby's health is a matter of stress and concern for the applicant and his family. Should the applicant reapply for permanent resident visas in the future, I would urge the Minister to process any subsequent application with dispatch.
Application dismissed.
