Strayer, J.
: In this case and in the case of Marubeni Corporation and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  damages for injuries allegedly caused to kraft paper rolls purchased by the plaintiffs in Canada and carried by the defendants' ships from Canada to Japan.
[2]
In each case the defendants have in part 2 of Schedule I of their list of documents listed an "Aall & Company Limited Survey Report" with respect to which they claim privilege. These surveys were carried out by a firm of marine surveyors during unloading operations in Japan, on behalf of the charterers, the P. & I. Underwriters and the paper producers. In each case the plaintiffs have applied for production of these documents and it is these applications which I must decide. The reasons in this case will apply equally to the application under T-2953-84.
[3]
After hearing counsel I subsequently inspected the documents in question pursuant to Rule 457, they having been provided to me under seal by counsel for the defendants.
[4]
I will first set out what I understand to be the principles upon which such applications should be decided. The onus is on the party claiming a privilege to establish it:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). It is now also clear that such party must establish that the dominant purpose for which the material is prepared was a privileged one:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.); Santa Ursula Navigation case, supra;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C.A.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C. A.). The basis for the claim of privilege in the present case is that the survey reports were prepared for purposes of litigation. As held by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 297-298, to make out such a claim it must be shown that such third party material must have been prepared both for the purpose of being provided to counsel and for the purpose of counsel using it in respect of litigation existing, or in contemplation, at the time of its preparation.
[5]
As noted above, the onus is on the defendants in these two cases to show that the survey reports come within these requirements. The only evidence provided by the defendants was a telex, verified by affidavit, sent by John Solberg, Director, Claims and Insurance, of Gearbulk Ltd., one of the defendants in each case. This telex states as follows:
"We confirm that surveys are conducted on forest product cargo carried from British Columbia to Japan aboard  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ships solely for the purpose of obtaining a reliable record of the condition of the cargo on discharge to resist claims for damage which may later be in whole or in part wrongfully made and become the subject of litigation.
"The nature of forest product cargo is such that it is in our experience susceptible to claims being made for damage sustained during the course of transportation and handling. The claims that are made can be inflated and/or wrongly attributed to one link in the transportation chain which can and frequently does consist of road, rail and barge carriage as well as one or more ships in any given instance.
"It is in the result important that the carrier be in a position to resist claims wrongfully made and it is in anticipation of such that surveys are regularly undertaken for both the owing and chartering interests of Gearbulk ships. The surveys are undertaken at the request and/or with the concurrence of the protection and indemnity underwriters insuring Gearbulk vessels who (subject to deductibles) bear the ultimate responsibility for claims properly made."
There was, of course, no opportunity for cross examination on this statement.
[6]
In my view this evidence is not sufficient to show that the dominant purpose for which the survey reports were prepared in these particular cases was either for the use of counsel or for the purpose of litigation existing or in contemplation. The evidence and the submissions of counsel for the defendants indicates that such surveys are done routinely upon the arrival of "forest product cargo" carried by the defendants' ships from Canada to Japan. Clearly no litigation was in existence when they were prepared. Nor is there any evidence to indicate that litigation was specifically in contemplation at that stage. An examination of the reports does not lead to such a conclusion.
[7]
The defendants' proposition seems to be that in such cases litigation is always a likelihood. Counsel relied on two recent decisions in the Supreme Court of British  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it was held that insurance adjusters' reports, "whenever there is a casualty" should be regarded as prepared for the dominant purpose of litigation because there is a "reasonable prospect thereof or because it is "likely to ensue". With respect, it appears to me that a judge must satisfy himself in each case on the basis of the facts therein as to whether the dominant purpose is litigation. The Federal Court of Appeal in the McPhail case, supra, rejected the notion that because all expropriations are potentially litigious any appraisal report prepared prior to, but with the possibility in mind of expropriation, is privileged.
[8]
From the evidence before me it appears that survey reports are useful for a number of purposes in identifying the nature of damage, if any, and the responsibility of the many parties involved in the transportation of goods by sea. I am not prepared, without more, to find that their dominant purpose here was preparation for litigation. The defendants have, therefore, not discharged the onus upon them and production of the survey report in each case will be ordered.
ORDER
[9]
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
(1) The defendants produce for inspection and copying the Aall & Company Limited Survey Report referred to in Part 2 of Schedule I of their list of documents.
