Reed, J.
: Arthur Ashby and Tom Ashby were ordered to appear before the Court to hear proof of certain acts of contempt with which they are charged and to urge any grounds of defence they might have. The acts of contempt relate to breaches of several orders of this Court. Those orders, amongst other things, prohibit the distribution and selling of counterfeit garments carrying the trademarks "Hugo Boss" or "Polo Ralph Lauren".
[2]
At the close of the hearing of this application, counsel for Tom Ashby conceded that his client was in contempt of the following orders of the Associate Chief Justice: one dated January 8, 1990 on file T-997-88; a second dated January 8, 1990 on file T-892-88; a third dated October 30, 1989 on file T-997-88; and a fourth dated October 30, 1989 on file T-592-88. The T-997-88 file relates to infringement of the "Hugo Boss" trademark. The T-892-88 file relates to the infringement of the "Polo Ralph Lauren" marks.
[3]
While it is conceded that Tom Ashby is guilty of contempt of the four orders in question, a number of defences were raised with respect to the position of Arthur Ashby.
[4]
Arthur Ashby is charged with breach of the same four orders as Tom Ashby. The breach of an additional order is alleged to have been committed by Arthur Ashby. Of the four orders, referred to above, the two dated October 30, 1989, are Anton Pillar orders. They were issued against a number of defendants, one of whom is Arthur Ashby carrying on business as A-Jay Enterprises and John Doe and Jane Doe and other persons, unknown to the plaintiffs, who offer for sale, sell, import, manufacture, advertise or deal in counterfeit Polo Ralph Lauren or Hugo Boss apparel. The Anton Pillar orders authorize the solicitors for the plaintiffs to seize any counterfeit garments carrying these trademarks, which they find, and deliver them to the Court [see footnote 1]. At the same time, as is usual in this type of order, the person or persons from whom the goods are seized is served with a notice of motion setting a date and time at which he or she can dispute the validity of that seizure. The Anton Pillar orders also require persons in possession of such counterfeit garments to allow the plaintiff's solicitors to search the premises where the garments are found and to disclose to the solicitors the source from which the garments were acquired.
[5]
The two orders of January 8, 1990, are interlocutory injunction orders. They order certain defendants including  Tom Ashby, not to sell, offer for sale, distribute, transfer or otherwise deal with clothing carrying the "Polo Ralph Lauren" and "Hugo Boss" marks.
[6]
The additional order, a breach of which is charged against Arthur Ashby, is an interlocutory injunction order of July 26, 1988. It orders certain named defendants, one of which is Arthur Ashby (carrying on business as A-Jay Enterprises), not to sell, offer for sale, distribute, transfer or otherwise deal with clothing carrying the "Hugo Boss" trademark.
Facts
[7]
It is necessary, first of all, to set the orders in the context of the overall litigation which the plaintiffs have been carrying on in this Court. In May and June of 1988, statements of claim were filed by the plaintiffs alleging infringement of their respective marks by numerous defendants both named and unnamed. Anton Pillar orders were issued against persons both named and unnamed. These Anton Pillar orders of May 16, 1988 (Polo Ralph Lauren) and June 1, 1988 (Hugo Boss) were extended or renewed from time to time. One such renewal occurred on October 30, 1989.
[8]
On June 13, 1988, interlocutory injunction orders issued, on consent, against certain named defendants prohibiting them from selling, transferring, or otherwise dealing with wearing apparel carrying the "Hugo Boss" ("Boss") or "Polo Ralph Lauren" ("Polo") marks. On July 12, 1988, Arthur Ashby, carrying on business as A-Jay Enterprises, was added as a defendant against whom the interlocutory injunction order in the Polo Ralph Lauren case applied. On July 26, 1988, Arthur Ashby, carrying on business as A-Jay Enterprises, was added as a defendant against whom the interlocutory injunction order in the Hugo Boss case applied. The interlocutory injunction orders against Arthur Ashby, carrying on business as A-Jay Enterprises, were served on August 10, 1988, by leaving a copy with Arthur's son Tom Ashby. These were left at a business premise on Passmore Road in Scarborough.
[9]
As has been noted, on October 30, 1989, Anton Pillar orders issued with respect to both marks (these were renewals of the earlier Anton Pillar orders). One of the named defendants therein was Arthur Ashby carrying on business as A-Jay Enterprises. Those orders, as is usual, also issued against John Doe and Jane Doe and other unnamed defendants.
[10]
In December 1989, solicitors for the plaintiffs attended at a store on Yonge Street which had counterfeit "Boss" and "Polo" shirts on display in the window. The outside of the store carried no trade name or marks of identification but inside the store the vendor's permit, which was affixed to the wall, indicated that that permit had been issued in the name of A-Jay Enterprises and Arthur Ashby. Steve Ashby was in charge of the store. The plaintiff's solicitor served the Anton Pillar orders of October 30, 1989, on Steve Ashby and took away approximately 100-150 counterfeit articles carrying the "Boss" and "Polo" marks (sweat-shirts and sweatpants). In answer to queries concerning the source of these garments, Steve Ashby informed the solicitors that they came from his father, Arthur Ashby.
[11]
The plaintiff's solicitor then attended at a Winges Road address in Woodbridge, which address had been on some of the boxes seized from the Yonge Street store. They again saw counterfeit garments. The Anton Pillar orders of October 30, 1989, were served on the person who appeared to be in charge, Tom Ashby. Five counterfeit garments were seized (two "Boss" and three "Polo"). Tom Ashby indicated that the source of the counterfeit garments was his father, Arthur Ashby.
[12]
Tom and Steve Ashby were then added as party defendants to the statement of claim and interlocutory injunction orders similar to those which had been issued against their father in July of 1988 were issued against them. These interlocutory injunction  orders were issued, as has been noted, on January 8, 1990. They were served personally on Tom Ashby at the Winges Road premises on January 25, 1990. The process server sought to serve both Tom and Steve Ashby but was told he would be unable to serve Steve because he was away at school in the United States. Arthur Ashby agreed to accept service on behalf of his son, Steve, and did so on January 29, 1990. Upon receiving the documents from the process server, Arthur ripped them up, in the presence of the process server, and threw them in the wastebasket stating that Steve was "never going to see these".
[13]
Two months later, on March 30, 1990, an investigator employed by the plaintiffs attended at the Winges Road store and saw some counterfeit "Boss" and "Polo" sweatshirts displayed. He bought two. The vendor was Tom Ashby. His father, Arthur, was seated in a corner of the room at the time, reading the newspaper. The investigator engaged Tom in conversation and made enquiries about buying T-shirts carrying the same brand names. He also enquired about buying T-shirts in bulk for possible resale. Tom Ashby informed the investigator that T-shirts would be arriving soon, in anticipation of the warmer summer weather, and that they could be bought in bulk. He also indicated that bulk purchases would be available at a lower price than a single garment purchase. Tom Ashby added a cautionary note. With respect to reselling the garments, he indicated that one had to be careful because "they could take them from you" if they find out.
[14]
The investigator left the Winges Road store with his "Polo" and "Boss" sweatshirt purchases. He returned a few minutes later with the plaintiff's solicitor. The solicitor proceeded to serve the Anton Pillar orders of October 30, 1989, with a view to taking away all the counterfeit garments on the premises which carried the "Boss" and "Polo" trademarks. The Anton Pillar documentation was handed to Tom Ashby and he was asked if he needed an explanation since he had been through this before (i.e., the previous December at the same Winges Road location). Arthur Ashby, then, entered the discussion. He picked up the documents from the counter and demanded an explanation as to where the solicitor for the plaintiffs got the authority to remove articles from the store. An explanation was given. Arthur became irate and profane. He would not let the solicitor and the investigator remove the two boxes of counterfeit garments which they could see. He would not let them search the store nor give them information concerning the source of the garments. He "showed" them the door and threw the Anton Pillar documents out the door after them, into a puddle of water. The door was locked and the lights turned off. The investigator went to the rear of the store and saw Tom Ashby leaving, carrying two large boxes. When Tom saw the investigator, he returned to the store. The solicitor for the plaintiffs picked the Anton Pillar documents out of the puddle and took them back to his office.
Arthur Ashby - Defences
[15]
As noted, Arthur Ashby has been ordered to show cause why he is not in contempt of the two Anton Pillar orders of October 30, 1989, and the two interlocutory injunction orders of January 8, 1990. The show cause orders respecting these issued on April 9, 1990. Subsequently, an order dated May 28, 1990, required him also to show cause as to why he was not in contempt of the interlocutory injunction order of July 26, 1988, relating to the "Hugo Boss" counterfeit garments.
[16]
Counsel for Arthur Ashby argues that the alleged contempt of the order of July 26, 1988, cannot be properly heard at this time because the show cause order of May 28, 1990, was never personally served on the defendant. After the Associate Chief Justice issued the show cause order on May 28, 1990, counsel for the plaintiffs had a copy delivered to counsel for Arthur Ashby. He was informed that counsel was not authorized to accept service of that document. A process server attempted,  four times thereafter, to personally serve Mr. Ashby but was unsuccessful. The documents were eventually left with Tom Ashby at the business premises of A-Jay Enterprises.
[17]
Counsel for the defendant argues that rule 355 requires personal service and since there was no personal service of the show cause order of May 28, 1990, the acts of contempt alleged in that order (relating to the July 26, 1988 interlocutory injunction) could not be proceeded with. He argues that the contempt process is quasi-criminal and therefore the procedural rules, especially those respecting personal service, must be strictly obeyed. I agreed to reserve judgment on this issue until the end of the hearing. The fact situation which underlies the contempt alleged concerning the July 26, 1988, order is identical to that which underlies the contempt alleged with respect to the other four orders. In such circumstances, there can be no prejudice visited upon the defendant, Arthur Ashby, as a result of reserving a decision on the issue of service until after the plaintiffs evidence is heard.
[18]
Counsel for Arthur Ashby argues that that defendant cannot be held in breach of the injunction orders of January 8, 1990, because he was not named in them, nor did he sell the merchandise. Counsel argues that Arthur Ashby cannot be held in breach of the Anton Pillar orders of October 30, 1989, because he was never served with these orders. This lack of service arises, it is argued, because the documents were handed to Tom Ashby and only one set of documents was served.
Service of May 28, 1990
Show Cause Order
[19]
With respect to the service of the May 28, 1990, show cause order alleging contempt of the July 26, 1988, interlocutory injunction order, rule 355(4) provides:
"No one may be condemned for contempt of court committed out of the presence of the judge, unless he has been served with a show cause order ordering him to appear before the Court, on the day and at the hour fixed to hear proof of the acts with which he is charged and to urge any grounds of defence that he may have. The show cause order ...
must be served personally, unless
for valid reasons
another mode of service is authorized
." (underlining added)
There was no personal service of the show cause order of May 28, 1990. An attempt was made to serve Arthur Ashby's solicitor; that service was refused. A process server tried on four occasions subsequent thereto to serve Mr. Ashby but was unsuccessful. Mr. Ashby was clearly evading service. The documents were finally left at Mr. Ashby's business premises with his son Tom. Mr. Ashby suffers no prejudice by being expected to answer the charge of contempt alleged with respect to the July 26, 1988, order at the same time as he is required to answer those alleged with respect to the other four charges, for which show cause orders have been personally served. The same facts underlie all five orders.
[20]
Contempt charges are quasi-criminal. The consequences are grave. An alleged contemptor faces the possibility of incarceration. Therefore, there is a requirement of strict compliance with the applicable rules, see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1. In addition, rule 2(2) of the Federal Court Rules sets out principles which are to govern the interpretation of those Rules:
"These Rules are intended
to render effective the substantive law and to ensure that it is carried out
; and they are to be so interpreted and applied as
to facilitate rather than to delay
or to end prematurely the  normal advancement of cases." (underlining added)
If the alleged breach of the July 26, 1988, order is not dealt with as part of the present proceedings, it will be necessary to hold a second hearing at which time the identical evidence to that adduced before me will be called. The only reason for such second hearing would be the alleged defect in service on Arthur Ashby who was present throughout the hearing of all the relevant evidence which pertains to the alleged breach of the July 26, 1988, order.
[21]
In this context the question that I must ask myself is whether the authority given to a judge, pursuant to rule 355(4), to authorize "another mode of service" (un autre mode de signification) can only be exercised prior to the hearing of the contempt charged or whether it can also be exercised coincident therewith.
[22]
There is no doubt that in the circumstances of this case, had an application been made, prior to the hearing, to authorize service by leaving the documentation at the business premises of Arthur Ashby, or by delivering such to his solicitor, that application would have been granted. Also, it is useful to quote from Louisell and Hazard in their Cases and Materials on Civil Procedure, at page 409:
"The spectre of the defendant locking himself in his house and slinking and dodging when out in public places, all in an effort (sometimes successful) to evade the actual touch of the process server, seems too much for a civilized adult society to abide. It appears never to have occurred to the courts to tell such a defendant that he is personally served when summons is so deposited that with any efforts but evasive ones he could receive it. Why should the sovereign's command be so lightly treated?"
[23]
Indeed, the jurisprudence, in related areas, reveals that where there is no evidence of prejudice to the respondent (defendant), a case will not be set aside simply because the rules of service have not been formally complied with. For example, see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.C.). Similarly persons who voluntarily appear are held not entitled to rely on defective service. These results are entirely consonant with the purpose for which personal service is required.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 539, the underlying principle was expressed as follows:
"The object of all service is of course only to give notice to the party on whom it is made, so that he may be made aware of and may be able to resist that which is sought against him; and when that has been substantially done so that the Court may feel perfectly confident that service has reached him, everything has been done that is required."
In later years, Hogg, J.A., stated in Re Avery, [1952] O.R. 192 (C.A.), at page 199:
"Personal service has been said to be service made by delivering the process into the defendant's hands or by seeing him and bringing the process to his notice."
[24]
Modern cases stress that the question of whether the purpose of giving notice to the person being served has been achieved is the relevant question. In Re Consiglio et al., [1971] 3 O.R. 798 (M.C.), the process server left the document with a non-party, and this subsequently came to the knowledge of the party to be served. In that case the Court held that personal service was satisfied if it appeared that the document came to the knowledge or into the possession of the person to be served either directly or indirectly from a third party. Then, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Man. Co. Ct.), the wife of director was served and she subsequently delivered the documents to her husband. It was held that personal  service on the husband was effected. The case stated that personal service will be effected if it can be shown that the person to be served actually received the document and was apprised of the contents whether directly or through an intermediary. The case also noted that the whole purpose of service is to apprise and give a party notice of proceedings intended to be taken against him, and if that object has been satisfied, and the process has actually reached the party, the precise manner in which that has occurred should not be of concern. It is clear, in this case, that the existence of the contempt charged with respect the breach of the July 26, 1988, order must have been within the knowledge of Arthur Ashby - how could his solicitor have received instructions not to accept service of the relevant documentation if this were not so.
[25]
As has been noted, the issue before me is the proper interpretation of rule 355(4) and particularly whether I may authorize, at this time, something less than personal service as being sufficient. I have come to the conclusion that rule 355(4) does not demand that the authorization of another mode of service must occur before the hearing of the contempt charged. To require such, in circumstances such as exist in this case, would flout the purposes set out in rule 2(2). The consequences would be that another hearing would have to be held, with all the attendant costs for all parties and for the Court, to address exactly the same evidence which is already before the Court. In the circumstances of this case, either notice to the solicitor or the leaving of the documentation at Mr. Ashby's business premises would constitute sufficient service had approval of such been obtained prior to the hearing. I think it would be a breach of the spirit and principles of rule 2(2) were rule 355(4) not interpreted to allow authorization of such service to take place coincident upon the hearing of the contempt charged as well as at some prior time. Accordingly in my view, the defendant was in this case properly served.
[26]
Mr. Ashby was in Court during the whole of the proceedings of June 6, 1990 which dealt with the contempts alleged to have arisen out of the events of March 30, 1990, at the Winges Road premises of A-Jay Enterprises. Arthur Ashby, offered no evidence to explain or negate any of the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs concerning the events of March 30, 1990. That stance was taken in the context of my reservation of a decision on the appropriateness of the service of the May 28, 1990 order. Accordingly, the defendant's decision in that regard cannot be taken as necessarily applicable to the alleged breach of the July 26, 1988 order. The defendant, Arthur Ashby, will be given two weeks from the date of this order to indicate, through his counsel, whether he wishes to adduce evidence to answer that which is on the record against him.
January 9, 1990 - Interlocutory
Injunction Orders
[27]
With respect to the alleged contempt of the two January 9, 1990, orders, I have considered whether Arthur Ashby was in contempt of those orders even though he was not named in them. (He was named in the style of cause although not in the body of the order.) Arthur Ashby aided and abetted the breach by Tom Ashby. It is clear that the father carried on business as A-Jay Enterprise. It was the father who arranged for the supply of counterfeit garments. The father was present during the sale of the counterfeit sweatshirts on March 30, 1990. He was present during the discussion of future sales of counterfeit T-shirts and of sales in bulk. He knew of the injunction orders prohibiting the sale of that merchandise. He knew that both he and his sons had been prohibited from selling, offering for sale or otherwise distributing such merchandise. Indeed, the evidence makes it clear that he was the motivating force behind his sons' activity.
[28]
It is clear that a person who is not named as a party in an order can be guilty of contempt for aiding and abetting a breach of that order. This was firmly established in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  make a contempt order against a third party is based on the premise that:
"He is bound, like other members of the public, not to interfere with, and not to obstruct, the course of justice; and the case, if any made against him must be this - not that he has technically infringed the injunction, which was not granted against him in any sense of the word but that he has been aiding and abetting others in setting the Court at defiance and deliberately heating the order of the Court as unworthy of notice."
The Supreme Court of Canada in dicta, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 788, adopted the rationale of the Seaward decision. The Court referred to the difference between actual breach of an injunction and actions which amount to an obstruction of justice in contempt cases. See also Baxter  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.), for a case where someone not actually bound by an injunction was held to be guilty of contempt on the ground that the actions of that person constituted an interference with the orderly administration of justice and the impairment of an order of the Court. See also Re Gaglardi (1960), 27 D.L.R.(2d) 281 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[29]
At the same time, counsel did not raise an argument before me that Arthur Ashby was guilty of contempt of the January 8, 1990, orders by virtue of activity which aided and abetted Tom Ashby's breaches of those orders. It may be that the wording of the show cause orders of April 9, 1990, does not bear this argument. In any event, since that argument was not raised, I do not think I should rely on it. In the absence of a finding that Arthur Ashby is in contempt because he aided and abetted his son, Tom, in the breaches of the relevant orders, I do not think Arthur Ashby can be found in contempt of the orders of January 8, 1990. These were issued against his sons. Those expressly naming the father had been issued, as indicated, at an earlier period of time.
October 30, 1989 -
Anton Piller Orders
[30]
With respect to the Anton Pillar orders of October 30, 1989, the defence of Arthur Ashby is an artificial and unpersuasive one. This is a situation in which knowledge of the order which is breached is sufficient to found a charge of contempt. See, for example,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 15 (F.C.T.D.) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.). Personal service by handing a document to Arthur Ashby is not necessary. This is especially so when the circumstances make it abundantly clear that his attitude was such that he was not prepared, in any event, to obey the orders of the Court. The handing over of a second set of documents would have been futile. Accordingly, Arthur Ashby is found to have been in contempt of the two Anton Pillar orders of October 30, 1989.
Penalty
[31]
I was referred to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ordered to be paid. I was referred to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), where a fine of $2,000.00 was imposed and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), where, on a second offence, a fine of $5,000.00 plus $2,000.00 in costs was imposed.
[32]
The offences in the present case demonstrate a blatant disregard for the  rights of others and for the orders of this Court. The defendants would be outraged if someone broke into their homes or business premises and stole goods from them. Yet, they have no compunction about stealing from others. They may not equate their activity of trading on the trademarks and trade names of others as theft, but such it is. It is merely a different kind of property right which is being stolen. It is clear that Arthur Ashby carries a heavier responsibility than his son and consequently the penalities imposed, per offence, should be proportionally higher. Counsel for the plaintiffs suggested that penalties for each offence on each file should be imposed separately. I agree that that is appropriate.
Order:
[33]
A fine of $1,500 for each offence committed by Tom Ashby will be imposed (a total of $6,000.00). Arthur Ashby will pay a fine of $3,000.00 for each offence committed by him in breach of the orders of October 30, 1989 (a total of $6,000.00 referrable to the October 30, 1989 orders). In addition, the defendants shall pay to the plaintiffs the costs of this action on a solicitor-client basis fixed at $2,400.00. Such shall be payable by the defendants in such proportion as they agree between themselves or on a fifty-fifty basis. These sums must be paid within 30 days of the date of this order. If payment of the fines and costs are not made within the 30 days, the plaintiffs or either of them may make application to commit the defendants to jail: in the case of Tom Ashby for not more than 30 days; in the case for Arthur Ashby for no more than 60 days. The defendant, Arthur Ashby, through his counsel, will notify the Court by letter addressed and delivered to the District Administrator of the Toronto Local Office as to whether he wishes to adduce evidence to respond to the evidence which has been presented with respect to the alleged breach of the July 26, 1988 order. If such letter is not received within two weeks of the date of this order, then a judgment will be rendered on the basis of the record as it stands. If Arthur Ashby wishes to present evidence, an order will issue setting a time, date and place for such hearing.
Order accordingly.
