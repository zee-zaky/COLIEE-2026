Jerome, A.C.J.
: This is an application, pursuant to s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended, for an order in the nature of certiorari, quashing the respondents' decision to transfer the petitioner from the Matsqui Medium Security Institution to Kent Maximum Security Institution. In addition, the petitioner seeks an order of mandamus, directing the respondents to transfer him back to the Matsqui Institution.
[2]
The petitioner is a federal prisoner, who was serving his sentence at the Matsqui Medium Security Institution. He was released on day parole from Robson Centre, a Community Correctional centre on September 13, 1988.
[3]
On September 17, 1988, Mr. Faulkner was arrested and charged with several offenses arising from six armed bank robberies. Following his arrest, he was placed in the Vancouver Pretrial Centre, a provincial remand facility, where he was expected to remain until the disposition of his charges. It was not anticipated that he would be back in the federal penitentiary system until such time as those charges were dealt with.
[4]
On October 3, 1988, while he was still in custody at the provincial remand centre, the petitioner's day parole was revoked and he was transferred from Matsqui to Kent Maximum Security Institution. Since Mr. Faulkner was not physically within the federal penitentiary system at the time, this transfer was effected on paper only. The petitioner then filed this notice of motion on April 11, 1989, seeking an order that he be returned to Matsqui Medium Security Institution on the ground that the decision to transfer him to Kent had not been made in compliance with the
Penitentiary Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-5, as am., and the Commissioner's Directives.
[5]
After being served with the notice of motion, and upon review of Mr. Faulkner's file, it was accepted by officials of Correctional Service of Canada that the transfer to Kent Institution had not been properly carried out. The transfer was accordingly set aside and the petitioner was returned to Matsqui Institution by way of internal documentation on April 24, 1989.
[6]
The petitioner's solicitor was advised of the administrative return to Matsqui by letter dated April 25, 1989, from Ms. Mary Humphries, counsel for the Department of Justice. The petitioner was also advised that a subsequent transfer from Matsqui to Kent might be considered following the outcome of his pending criminal charges. That letter stated as follows:
"This will confirm that Mr. Faulkner, who is presently incarcerated in the provincial pretrial centre awaiting trial on outstanding charges, will be returned on paper from Kent to Matsqui. Following the outcome of his new charges, a transfer from Matsqui to Kent may be considered."
[7]
On April 24, 1989, Mr. Faulkner's file was reviewed by penitentiary officials, who decided, in view of the serious nature of the charges arising out of his activities while on conditional release, that he should be reclassified to maximum security as he no longer met the requirements of medium security. On May 4, 1989, the petitioner, while still at the provincial remand centre, was served with a notification of recommendation for involuntary transfer advising him that:
"You are hereby notified that I intend to recommend your involuntary transfer to Kent Institution.
"You may make any comments, in writing, within forty-eight (48) hours, and these shall be considered with my recommendation.
"
Reason
:
"On 1988 09 13, you were released from Matsqui Institution to Robson Centre on day parole status.
"While on day parole, on 1988 09 17, you were arrested by police. You were found in possession of a loaded handgun and you were charged with a number of armed robberies.
"Your day parole was subsequently revoked by the National Parole Board.
"Your negative behaviour reflects the need for a higher security placement as you pose a serious risk to the community."
[8]
On May 5, 1989, although the petitioner was still remanded awaiting trial on the outstanding charges, the remand warrant was amended by a judge removing the direction to hold Mr. Faulkner in the provincial remand centre. He was accordingly brought to Kent Institution on an emergency basis pending the final decision respecting his transfer from Matsqui to Kent. That final decision was made on May 18, 1989.
[9]
Although Mr. Faulkner had indicated on the notice of recommendation for involuntary transfer dated May 4, 1989, that he wished to make written representations within forty-eight hours respecting the decision to transfer him to Kent Institution, he did not do so. There is a letter from the petitioner to penitentiary officials concerning the transfer, but that letter, while dated May 5, 1989, was not written on that date nor was it submitted within forty-eight hours from the date of the notification of recommendation for involuntary transfer. In fact, on May 30, 1989, the warden of Matsqui Institution sent the petitioner the following letter:
"On May 24, 1989, I received your letter dated May 05, 1989.
"You were served with notification of recommendation for involuntary transfer on May 04, 1989, at the Vancouver pretrial centre. At that time you indicated you would be responding in writing within forty-eight (48) hours, as specified in the Commissioner's Directives.
"On May 16, 1989, as no response was received (some eleven (11) days beyond the specified time frame) transfer documentation was forwarded to the Assistant Deputy Commissioner, Operations for a final decision. Your transfer to Kent Institution was formally authorized on May 18, 1989.
"It should be noted that our Transfer Officer, Mr. Baldwin, spoke with Mr. Gauthier at Kent the week following your receipt of the involuntary notice. Mr. Gauthier then spoke with you and you requested additional time to prepare a written response. Based on that information, I find it somewhat interesting that your letter is in fact dated May 05, 1989.
"In any event, as the transfer has been approved, your course of redress at this point would be to submit a grievance directly to National Headquarters as per the Commissioner's Directives."
[10]
This notice of motion was initially heard by Mr. Justice Muldoon on July 20, 1989. The application was dismissed on the basis that the initial transfer to Kent Institution of October 3, 1988, had been voluntarily set aside by the respondents. This order was appealed on the ground that the court had failed to consider the affidavit of Mr. Faulkner sworn August 9, 1989. By order of the Federal Court of Appeal dated December 11, 1990, the decision of the Trial Division was set aside and the matter was returned for a hearing on the merits.
[11]
I have now carefully reviewed all submissions made by the petitioner, including the three affidavits sworn by him on April 9, May 24, and August 9, 1989, respectively. Mr. Faulkner's position is that, in relation to the initial transfer to Kent Institution, the respondents did not in fact set aside that transfer and administratively return him to Matsqui Institution. He bases this argument on the fact that his personal effects were sent to Kent at the time of the transfer, on October 3, 1988, but were never returned to Matsqui after April 24, 1989, the date on which the initial transfer was set aside. The petitioner further argues that, with respect to his second transfer to Kent on May 18, 1989, the submissions he made in response to the notice of recommendation for involuntary transfer were never considered by the respondents who must, therefore, be seen to have breached their duty to act fairly towards him.
[12]
It is not disputed that the failure of Correctional Service of Canada to advise the petitioner of the reasons for his initial transfer to Kent Institution on October 3, 1989, was contrary to their obligation to treat Mr. Faulkner in a fair and just manner. I am satisfied, however, that the respondents acted correctly and within their authority when, upon becoming apprised of their error with respect to the transfer procedures followed, they set aside the decision and corrected the defect. Penitentiary officials have the power to rescind their own administrative decisions once it is established that those decisions were improperly made. Provided that power is exercised in accordance with the obligation to act fairly towards inmates, no grounds will exist which would warrant judicial intervention.
[13]
This position has been confirmed by the decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  1992). In that case, an inmate had been transferred from a medium security institution to a minimum security institution under a mistake of fact by officials of Correctional Service of Canada. When the mistake came to light, the inmate was involuntarily transferred back to the medium security institution. The inmate argued that this amounted to procedural unfairness. Mr. Justice Bouck concluded that the conduct of the Correctional Service officials was fair in the circumstances, stating at p. 12 as follows:
"But, are the inarticulate reasons of Correctional Service regarding his transfer from Ferndale to Mountain of such a nature that Mr. Brooks should succeed on this application? In the words of the Supreme Court of Canada, did the conduct of the Correctional Service officials amount to procedural unfairness? I don't think so.
"Where the Correctional Service makes a mistake in administering the
Penitentiary Act
, it should be allowed to correct the mistake if it has legitimate reasons for doing so. In this case, it made the mistake of transferring him to Ferndale when it did not appreciate he lacked the initial sex therapy treatment required before he could take the Relapse Prevention Program at Ferndale. Nor was it aware of the report of the National Parole Board recommending against his transfer to Ferndale at that time. To correct the error, it returned Mr. Brooks to Mountain so that he could take intensive sex therapy treatment that might qualify him for a later transfer to Ferndale. These are all demonstrably fair reasons and so his involuntary transfer to Mountain should be upheld. Mr. Brooks should not receive indirectly that which was already refused him directly."
[14]
I am not persuaded by the petitioner's argument that his personal effects remaining at Kent and not being returned to Matsqui is somehow indicative that the transfer was never in fact set aside. The evidence of Ms. Ginger Bacchus, Regional Chief, Sentence Administration for the Pacific Region of Correctional Service of Canada, and of Ms. Mary Humphries, lawyer with the Vancouver Regional Office of the Department of Justice for Canada, is that when the mistake in the transfer procedure was discovered, the transfer was indeed set aside and the petitioner was administratively returned to Matsqui Institution. In light of the fact that Mr. Faulkner was at all times in custody at the provincial remand facility awaiting disposition of his outstanding charges, I place no significance on the fact that his personal effects were not transferred back to Matsqui after the initial transfer was set aside on April 24, 1989. Furthermore, on that same date, officials of Correctional Service reviewed his file once again and determined that he should be transferred to a maximum security institution. That determination set in motion the procedural operations required for a valid transfer, which was approved a short time later on May 18, 1989.
[15]
In the present case, Correctional Service of Canada, in setting aside the initial transfer and administratively returning the petitioner to Matsqui Institution, acted expeditiously and fairly towards Mr. Faulkner once its error in executing the transfer became apparent. That action was an administrative step fairly taken and within the authority and jurisdiction of penitentiary officials. Accordingly, there is nothing which would warrant judicial interference with that decision.
[16]
The petitioner further submits however, that the second involuntary transfer to Kent Institution is invalid on the grounds that the respondents breached their duty to act fairly, in that his submissions concerning the transfer were not considered.
[17]
I cannot accept this argument. What the law requires in cases of this nature, is that the general duty of fairness be observed. There is no question that prison officials have a duty to act fairly in the exercise of their administrative functions. If there appears to have been a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, the courts, in exercising their powers of judicial review, will not hesitate to intervene. However, the decision to transfer an inmate from one institution to another, is essentially an administrative matter. As such, it will only be interfered with by the courts on the rare occasion when it is manifestly clear the inmate has not been dealt with fairly, taking into account all the circumstances surrounding the transfer.
[18]
The respondents' second decision to involuntarily transfer the petitioner to Kent Maximum Security Institution cannot be seen to have been made in contravention of the duty to act fairly, given the types of reasonable concerns which prison officials had with respect to the appropriateness of Mr. Faulkner remaining at a medium security institution.
[19]
The evidence is unequivocal that Mr. Faulkner was served with the notice of recommendation for involuntary transfer and afforded an opportunity to respond. Indeed, he indicated on that notice that he wished to make written submissions within forty-eight hours. He did not do so. In fact, he did not make any submissions until six days after the final decision to transfer him to Kent had been made on May 18, 1989. Thereafter, as was explained to him by the warden of Matsqui Institution, his proper recourse was to submit a grievance directly to National Headquarters in accordance with the Commissioner's Directives.
[20]
I am unable to conclude therefore, that the respondents have breached their duty to act fairly. It is apparent that the requirements as set out in the
Penitentiary Act
and the Commissioner's Directives for an involuntary transfer of an inmate from one institution to another have been complied with.
[21]
For these reasons, the application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
