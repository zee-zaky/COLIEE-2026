Giles, Associate Senior Prothonotary
: The motion before me seeks an order that copies of certain documents be produced by the plaintiffs pursuant to rule 407(2).
"Rule 407(1) Every pleading is to be filed and, subject to rule 306, a copy thereof is to be served on the other parties forthwith after filing.
"(2) A copy of every document referred to in a pleading shall be served on each party on whom a pleading is served at the same time as the pleading is served or within 30 days of that time, unless
(a) such party waives his right to such copy; or
(b) the court, for special reason, otherwise orders."
The documents alleged to be referred to in a pleading are admittedly not directly referred to, but it is argued, are indirectly referred to. In paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim is found the sentence:
"In 1992 Smith & Nephew ceased manufacture, and became the exclusive Canadian distributor and licensee of BDF (to whom the NIVEA marks had been sold) for Canada."
"BDF" means Beiersdorf AG, a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Germany.
[2]
In paragraph 7 is found the following:
"Since 1992 these products have been manufactured by Beiersdorf Inc. in the United States, a wholly owned subsidiary of BDF, and have been imported into Canada and sold in Canada by Smith & Nephew pursuant to an exclusive licencee and distributorship agreement. The exclusive licence and distributorship rights are granted to Smith & Nephew from BDF through BDF's wholly-owned subsidiary in the United States, Beiersdorf Inc. Under this licence and distributorship arrangement, BDF controls the character and quality of the NIVEA product distributed by Smith & Nephew in Canada (subject to Smith & Nephew's own internal controls and approval), and controls the manner in which Smith & Nephew uses the NIVEA trademarks in Canada."
The defendant seeks the licence and distributorship agreements referred to in paragraphs 6 and 7.
[3]
Paragraph 32 of the Statement of Claim reads:
"The plaintiff Smith & Nephew has given 60 days' notice to BDF of its intention to bring the within action against Glen Oak and Bi-Way. BDF has declined to take action. BDF however has authorized Smith & Nephew to take these proceedings in its own name, with authorization to include BDF as a named party. The plaintiff Smith & Nephew pleads and relies on s. 50(3) of the
Trade Mark Act
, supra."
The defendant seeks copies of the notice and authorization.
[4]
The defendant argues that the words "became the exclusive licencee of BDF" in paragraph 6 indicate that there are distributorship and licensing agreements which ought to be adduced under rule 407(2). It appears that BDF may have licensed Beiersdorf Inc. ("B.D.I.") in the United States and B.D.I. licenced the plaintiff. A distributorship agreement (the "Agreement") in which rights as to the trademarks at issue are mentioned has been produced. The Agreement is between B.D.I. and the plaintiff. In my view this is evidence of the fact that the words in paragraph 6 may not indicate the existence of a distributorship or licence agreement between B.D.F. and the plaintiff, which in the light of the agreement produced is not in any event necessary. The licence and distributorship agreement mentioned in paragraph 7 between B.D.F. and the plaintiff has apparently been produced and is the Agreement.
[5]
In the light of the detail of the Agreement, it may be that the Agreement is the one through which B.D.F. controls the quality of the product. In any event, paragraph 7 does not, in my view, constitute a reference to a document other than the Agreement which has been produced. The fact that there must be a document by B.D.F. to constitute B.D.I. or the plaintiff, a registered user, is something which can be followed up upon discovery. Such a document is not directly referred to nor is it indirectly referred to. In my view, if I say that I am the owner of lot 2 in the 4th Concession, rule 407(2) does not require me to produce a complete chain of title back to the original grant from the Crown to prove my statement. The chain of title is a matter for discovery. Rule 407(2) is not intended to permit early discovery and to attempt to so use it is abusive.
[6]
The request for a copy of the "notice" and "authorization" referred to in paragraph 32, again presumes a document to exist from the language used. Section 50(4) of
Trade-marks Act
does not require a notice nor for that matter does it require 60 days' notice of intention to proceed. The mentioned 60-days notice might have been given orally and therefore the wording of paragraph 32 does not necessarily impute the existence of a document. In my view, therefore, rule 407(2) does not require the production of the document we know exists and for which privilege is claimed.
[7]
The subsection of the
Trade-marks Act
also does not require any authorization. The registered owner is by that subsection entitled to proceed after two months unless an agreement requires otherwise. If an agreement requires authorization, the authorization between related companies as these are alleged to be, could well be verbal. In my view therefore, no documents have been referred to directly or indirectly which rule 407(2) would require the plaintiffs to produce. I do not have to consider whether by its long delay in seeking these documents, the defendant has waived its rights under rule 407(2) nor whether by mentioning the authorization, the plaintiff has waived its solicitor and client privilege therein.
Order:

Motion dismissed.
Application dismissed.
