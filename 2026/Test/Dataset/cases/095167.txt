Teitelbaum, J.
: This is a motion filed on behalf of the applicant, A. Allen Paquette, for the determination of the question whether certain trust account records requested by Revenue Canada in a letter dated April 10, 1992, are covered by solicitor-client privilege.
[2]
The applicant states, in his notice of motion, as his grounds for the present application "that the records requested by Revenue Canada are covered by solicitor-client privilege and therefore need not be disclosed to Revenue Canada Taxation".
[3]
The facts leading to the present notice of motion are the following: That on or about June 10, 1992, a client of the applicant, the applicant being a barrister and solicitor, a certain Mr. William D. Groves, was indebted to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada (Crown) in the amount of $74,014.76. It appears that Mr. Groves has been consistently indebted to the "Crown" since 1983 in relation to amounts due in respect of the 1979 and subsequent taxation years and has made no voluntary payments on the amount of tax owing. The Department of National Revenue has made numerous unsuccessful attempts to collect the outstanding taxes owing since 1983, both verbally and through written correspondence and meetings.
[4]
On or about January 29, 1992, William D. Groves pled guilty to a charge of failing to comply with a notice to provide documents pursuant to s. 238(1) of the
Income Tax Act
(
Act
) and was sentenced to a fine of $1,000.
[5]
Section 238(1) of the
Act
states:
"Every person who has failed to file or make a return as and when required by or under this Act or a regulation or who has failed to comply with subsection 116(3), 127(3.1) or (3.2), 147.1(7) or 153(1), any of ss. 230 to 232 or a regulation made under subsection 147.1(18) or with an order made under subsection (2) is guilty of an offence and, in addition to any penalty otherwise provided, is liable on summary conviction to
(a) a fine of not less than $1,000 and not exceeding $25,000; or
(b) such a fine and imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months."
[6]
The fine of $1,000 was paid by Mr. Grove's solicitor, the present applicant. On April 10, 1992, a Mr. Paul E. Seguin, Director Taxation, Vancouver District Office of the Department of National Revenue, Taxation, wrote to the applicant requesting, pursuant to s. 231.2 of the
Act
that the applicant "provide all trust account records including ledger cards, journal entries and cancelled cheques that were known to have been related to entries or transactions for, or on behalf of William D. Groves (para. 9, O'Dea Affidavit of June 10, 1992)."
[7]
The letter dated April 10, 1992, can be found as Exhibit "A" to the affidavit of the applicant dated May 19, 1992. The letter states:
"For purposes related to the administration or enforcement of the
Income Tax Act
, pursuant to the provisions of s. 231.2 of the said
Act
, I hereby require from you within thirty (30) days of receipt of this notice:
All trust account records including ledger cards, journal entries and cancelled cheques that are known to be or to have been related to entries or transactions with, for, or on behalf of the individual named above, or persons known to be or have been acting on behalf of the above-named individual, during the period January 29, 1992, to March 18, 1992.
If this notice is not complied with within thirty (30) days of receipt, you will be liable for prosecution without further notice.
Subsection 238(1) of the said
Act
provides that a person who fails to comply with this notice is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000, and not more than $25,000 or both the fine and imprisonment not exceeding 12 months.
Subsection 238(2) of the said
Act
provides that where a person is found guilty of an offence under subsection 238(1), the court may make an order as it deems proper in order to enforce compliance with the notice."
[8]
I am satisfied that the letter requests more information than what Mr. O'Dea states was requested in his statement found in paragraph 9 of his June 10, 1992, affidavit, as there is, as well, a request "or persons known to be or have been acting on behalf of the above-named individual during the period January 29, 1992, to March 18, 1992".
[9]
Mr. O'Dea states in paragraph 9 of his June 10, 1992, affidavit that it was he who wrote to the applicant with the above request. This is incorrect. As I have stated, the letter is signed by a Paul E. Seguin. Mr. O'Dea's name appears on the top left of the letter. I am indeed surprised that Mr. O'Dea believes himself to be the writer of the letter and yet allows Mr. Seguin to sign same.
[10]
The Department of National Revenue is continuing, as of June 10, 1992, to make attempts to collect the outstanding taxes owing by Mr. Groves. In fact, Mr. Groves has paid a sum of $40,000 on account of his outstanding taxes and that this payment was made on June 9, 1992. The payment was made in cash.
[11]
The above facts are obtained from the affidavits of Mr. O'Dea signed on June 10, 1992, and June 11, 1992. There is no contradictory evidence before me to indicate that what is said by Mr. O'Dea is not exact except as above stated.
[12]
In the affidavit of William D. Groves, dated June 10, 1992, he admits to receiving a "demand letter" dated September 25, 1990, from Revenue Canada pursuant to s. 231.2 of the
Act
and "for personal reasons" he did not comply with the demand, resulting in a fine of $1,000 and which fine was paid by the applicant on behalf of Mr. Groves. The fine of $1,000 was paid by the applicant with his trust cheque. (Exhibit "C" Groves Affidavit)
[13]
After the applicant received the April 10, 1992, letter of demand from Mr. Seguin (Exhibit "A" to Paquette Affidavit), the demand being made pursuant to s. 231.2 of the
Act
, which states:
"(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, subject to subsection (2), for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of this Act, by notice served personally or by registered or certified mail, require that any person provide, within such reasonable time as is stipulated in the notice,
(a) any information or additional information, including a return of income or a supplementary return; or
(b) any document."
Mr. Groves, the applicant's client, instructed the applicant to refuse the release of the requested records on the basis of solicitor-client privilege.
[14]
According to counsel for the applicant, he states that there are two issues to be decided:
1. That the demand made by Revenue Canada in April of 1992 for the production of certain documents did not comply with s. 231.2(2), (3) and (4) of the
Act
and therefore the demand was invalid and s. 232(e) of the
Act
cannot apply in determining solicitor/client privilege.
2. The true purpose of the demand in April of 1992 was not in pursuit of an on-going and continuing inquiry and therefore should not have been made pursuant to s. 231.2 of the
Act
, thus rendering the demand invalid.
[15]
I will deal with the second issue as stated by applicant's counsel and then deal with the first issue.
[16]
The evidence of Mr. O'Dea, which has not been contradicted in any substantial manner, clearly indicates that the purpose of the demand made upon the applicant was in pursuit of an ongoing and continuing inquiry.
[17]
Mr. O'Dea states in his affidavit that Mr. Groves was indebted to the "Crown" since 1983 (para. 4), that numerous unsuccessful attempts to collect were made (para. 5) and that the Department of National Revenue
is continuing
to make attempts to collect the outstanding taxes owing by Mr. Groves (para. 10).
[18]
The above clearly indicates to me that there has been, since 1983, an ongoing and continuing inquiry by the Ministry of National Revenue as to how to collect the income taxes owing by Mr. Groves.
[19]
Counsel for the applicant submits that because the demand made on the applicant was for documents from January 29, 1992, to March 18, 1992, only, this is a clear indication that up to January 29, 1992, there was no ongoing and continuing inquiry. As I have stated, I do not accept this submission, as Mr. O'Dea's evidence clearly indicates an ongoing inquiry on how to collect the taxes owing by Mr. Groves. The fact that documents are requested for a specific period does not indicate anything other than a request for documents for a specified time frame.
[20]
Counsel submits that as a result of the manner in which the demand is made in the letter of April 10, 1992 to the applicant, the demand is invalid. I am satisfied that the demand asks for two things: (1) all trust account records including ledger cards, journal entries and cancelled cheques that are known to be or to have been related to entries or transactions with, for, or on behalf of Mr. Groves or (2) all trust account records including ledger cards, journal entries and cancelled cheques that are known to be or to have been related to entries or transactions with, for, or on behalf of persons known to be or have been acting on behalf of Mr. Groves during the period January 29, 1992, to March 18, 1992.
[21]
Section 231.2(2) states that when dealing with documents involving unnamed persons, judicial authorization must first be obtained if a demand for these documents is to be made.
"231.2(2) Unnamed persons. The Minister shall not impose on any person (in this section referred to as a 'third party') a requirement under subsection (1) to provide information or any document relating to one or more unnamed persons unless he first obtains the authorization of a judge under subsection (3)."
[22]
It is apparent that the respondent never obtained any judicial authorization to make a demand pursuant to s. 231.2(2). Counsel for respondent submits that the demand is not being made pursuant to s. 231.2(2) as, he submits, no documentation is being requested involving unnamed persons. He submits that what Mr. Paul E. Seguin meant when he wrote the "demand" letter of April 10, 1992, were other persons (unnamed) in the law firm of the applicant.
[23]
I cannot and do not accept this submission. The letter speaks of "persons known to be ...". I take this to mean other unnamed persons not in the applicant's firm. I do not have any evidence that there are "others" in the applicant's firm. Furthermore, the letter is written to the applicant personally and not to a firm of attorneys.
[24]
The fact that the second part of the demand is invalid, as a result of not first obtaining authorization from a judge, does this make the entire demand invalid?
[25]
Counsel for the applicant states that it does. He states, if one is served with a demand pursuant to s. 321.2 and does not comply with the demand, he or she is subject pursuant to s. 238(2) of the
Act
to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $25,000 or both the fine and imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. This indicates, according to counsel, that the Minister must act strictly in accordance with the provisions of the
Act
and failing to do so renders the whole demand invalid.
[26]
With the greatest respect, I cannot accept this submission by counsel. Firstly, I am satisfied I do not have to determine if the applicant's trust account records including ledger cards, journal entries and cancelled cheques as they relate to Mr. Groves are subject to solicitor-client privilege. Section 232.1(e) of the
Act
states:
"'Solicitor-client privilege' - 'solicitor-client privilege' means the right, if any, that a person has in a superior court in the province where the matter arises to refuse to disclose an oral or documentary communication on the ground that the communication is one passing between him and his lawyer in professional confidence,
except that for the purposes of this section an accounting record of a lawyer, including any supporting voucher or cheque, shall be deemed not to be such a communication
." (Underlining mine)
[27]
Clearly, the accounting record of the applicant as it relates to Mr. Groves, including any supporting voucher or cheque cannot now be considered as being subject to a solicitor-client privilege.
[28]
Furthermore, Mr. Justice Collier in
Re Romeo's Place Victoria Ltd. and R.
(1981), 128 D.L.R.(3d) 279 (F.C.T.D.), in speaking of trust account records of a lawyer, states at page 289:
"Trust account records are, undoubtedly, accounting records of a lawyer."
and at page 290:
"I note that the present version of s. 126(1) (now s. 231(1)) simply reads: where '... any books or records are or should be kept ...'. The words 'pursuant to this
Act
' have been removed.
"I do not, in any way, question the correctness of the
Helman
decision and the earlier case. Those cases dealt with the investigation of a lawyer's affairs. The demand for trust records involved the disclosure of the confidential affairs and communications between solicitor and client. But the clients' tax affairs were not under investigation.
"That is not the situation here. The tax affairs of the clients, not their solicitor, are being investigated. The clients are, in reality, claiming the privilege. But the statute specifically provides the solicitor's trust account records of those clients are not privileged. In that aspect, as distinguished from the
Helman
case, the legislators have, in my view, clearly done away with the normal solicitor-client privilege."
[29]
I am satisfied that, in the present circumstances, there does not exist the normal solicitor-client privilege for lawyers trust account records including the ledgers and cheques.
[30]
I am also satisfied that the fact that Mr. Seguin, acting for the respondent, combined a demand for documents pursuant to s. 231.2(1) and s. 231.2(2) and failed to obtain the authorization of a judge as per s. 231.2(2), does not render the entire demand invalid but only that part for which the provision was not adhered to. Madame Justice Wilson, in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 1, at p. 578 S.C.R., in speaking of taxing statutes states:
"Professor Willis, in his article, supra, accurately forecast the demise of the strict interpretation rule for the construction of taxing statutes. Gradually, the role of the tax statute in the community changes, as we have seen, and the application of strict construction to it receded. Courts today apply to this statute the plain meaning rule, but in a substantive sense so that if a taxpayer is within the spirit of the charge, he may be held liable. See Whiteman and Wheatcroft, supra, at p. 37."
[31]
This statement indicates that the spirit of ss. 231 and 232 of the
Act
is to allow the respondent to review and access a taxpayer which indicates that the respondent must be able to get the information he requires pursuant to s. 231.2.
[32]
Therefore, the respondent is permitted to examine all trust account records, including ledger cards, journal entries and cancelled cheques that are known to be or to have been related to entries or transactions with, for, or on behalf of Mr. Groves during the period January 29, 1992, to March 18, 1992.
[33]
Costs in favour of respondent.
Order accordingly.
