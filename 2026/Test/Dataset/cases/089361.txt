Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Mosley, J.
: The applicant, Wissam Mohamad Jawad, seeks judicial review of the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division which found that the applicant was excluded from the definition of a Convention Refugee by reason of serious criminality and, in the alternative, that he was not a person in need of protection because he had internal flight alternatives in Lebanon.
[2]
I find that the Board erred in its exclusion decision but reached a reasonable determination on the existence of internal flight alternatives. For that reason, the application is dismissed.
BACKGROUND
:
[3]
Mr. Jawad is a citizen of Lebanon. He was born and raised in a neighbourhood of Beirut controlled by the Shi'a Muslim militant group and political party, Hezbollah. His father was Shi'a but his Egyptian mother belonged to the Sunni branch of Islam. The applicant and his siblings followed the mother's tradition. He says that they were harassed by their neighbours for that reason. The mother continues to live in the same neighbourhood with the applicant's sister. His brother also continues to live in Beirut.
[4]
The applicant says he encountered difficulties with Hezbollah following the death of his father in 1989. He claims that a death threat was issued against him for having defaced posters of the Hezbollah leader. In 1995 he went to the United States of America as a visitor and obtained a work permit. He was married in1996 and received permanent residence status in 1997. He divorced his first wife in 2000 and remarried in 2002.
[5]
In 2004, the applicant was charged in Florida with trafficking in cocaine following the search of his car on a tip from an informant. The applicant was found in possession of an amount variably referenced in the arresting officers' reports as 83 and 70 grams. In court, the charge was amended by the state prosecutor and the applicant pleaded no contest to possession of 70 grams. Under a procedure known as "adjudication withheld", no formal finding of guilt was made but a term of probation with a recommendation for drug treatment was imposed. The applicant also had to make a payment of US $50.00. It is not clear whether that was a fine or for costs.
[6]
In April 2006, Mr. Jawad was arrested by US immigration authorities and detained for several months pending removal from the United States because of the possession offence. Deportation was deferred due to the situation at that time in Lebanon. He was released pending a change in the country conditions and informed that he had the option to voluntarily leave the USA. The applicant chose to do so notwithstanding that he was still under a State probation order requiring regular reporting.
[7]
In August 2006 the applicant entered Canada with his wife and first child. He did not disclose his status in the US to an immigration officer at the Port of Entry but later sought legal advice in Montreal regarding his options. A second child was born to the couple in Canada. The applicant's wife attempted to obtain residency in Canada for herself and the children by applying from the United States. When that was unsuccessful, she remained there with the children. Jawad stayed in Canada without status.
[8]
When he did not report as required, an arrest warrant was issued against Mr. Jawad for breach of the probation order in Florida. In April 2009, he was arrested after being stopped for running a traffic light in Surrey B.C. and turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency. He then applied for refugee status.
[9]
The applicant claims that if required to return to any place in Lebanon he would be persecuted by Hezbollah due to his prior activities and recent public statements. In 2010, he posted negative comments on the social media website Facebook criticizing Hezbollah and its leader, Nesrallah.
[10]
Following his arrest in 2009, the Minister initially sought an order of inadmissibility against the applicant under s. 36 (2) (b) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
,SC 2001, c 27 on the ground that he had been convicted of an offence outside Canada that would constitute an indictable offence in Canada. That application was withdrawn. Thus there was no determination of inadmissibility precluding referral of the claim to the Refugee Protection Division.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
:
[11]
The Board noted that for the applicant to be excluded under Article 1 F (b) of the
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
, 28 July 1951, 189 UNTS 137 ("the Convention") required a finding of serious reasons for considering that he had committed a serious, non-political crime prior to his entry into Canada. The Board gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt arising from the discrepancies as to the quantity of cocaine in question and accepted that it was 70 grams.
[12]
Based on the applicant's evidence, the Board found that the value of 70 grams was about $1200.00 and that such quantity was sufficient for approximately six months of personal consumption. The Board found the applicant's explanation that he would buy 6 months worth of cocaine for personal consumption to be implausible, considering his financial situation at the time. The Board determined that the applicant's possession of cocaine was for the purpose of trafficking notwithstanding that the disposition by the Florida court was for the lesser offence of simple possession. The Board justified this on the ground that the language of Article 1 F (b) refers to "commission" not "conviction".
[13]
The Board found that the equivalent crime in Canada was trafficking in a controlled substance pursuant to s. 5 (1) of the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act
, SC 1996, c 19 ("CDSA"). S. 5 (3) of the CDSA provides that the maximum sentence for an offence under s. 5 (1) is imprisonment for life.
[14]
The Board also looked at the criteria for seriousness set out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Board found that the amendment of the charge was an element in favour of the applicant, but his failure to complete his sentence in the USA and the type of crime initially charged were elements pointing to the seriousness of the crime. The Board thus concluded that the applicant was excluded pursuant to Article 1 F (b) of the Convention.
[15]
The Board considered that the applicant's failure to claim asylum in the USA and delay in claiming refugee status in Canada raised concerns regarding his credibility. It found that his evidence was not credible with regard to whether his fear of persecution or harm upon a return to Lebanon was well-founded.
[16]
The Board found that the applicant had an internal flight alternative in the Lebanese cities of Halba, Tripoli and Albirah. The Board noted the violence in Lebanon and the omnipresence of the Hezbollah. Nevertheless, the Board found that because the applicant was not well known, was not politically involved and was well educated, it was reasonable for him to move to one of those cities.
ISSUES
:
[17]
The issues arising from the Board's decision are:
a. Was the Board's decision relating to its exclusion findings reasonable?
b. Was the Board's decision relating to the merits of the refugee claim reasonable?
RELEVANT LEGISLATION
:
[18]
Section 98 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 reads as follows:
98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
98. La personne visée aux sections E ou F de l'article premier de la Convention sur les réfugiés ne peut avoir la qualité de réfugié ni de personne à protéger.
[19]
Article 1 F (b) of the
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
, 28 July 1951, 189 UNTS 137, found in schedule 1 of the IRPA, states:
Article 1
F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
(
b
) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;
Article 1
F. Les dispositions de cette Convention ne seront pas applicables aux personnes dont on aura des raisons sérieuses de penser:
b
) Qu'elles ont commis un crime grave de droit commun en dehors du pays d'accueil avant d'y être admises comme réfugiés;
ANALYSIS
:
Standard of Review
[20]
The standards of review for the questions of fact and law before this Court have been satisfactorily determined by the jurisprudence and a further analysis applying the factors set out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is not necessary.
[21]
The standard of review for the application of Article 1 F (b) of the Convention is reasonableness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aff'd by 2008 FCA 404; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
Decisions determining the existence of an internal flight alternative are also reviewed on the reasonableness standard:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[23]
Reasonableness is premised on the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process and whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47; and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Was the Board's finding of exclusion reasonable?
[24]
The applicant argues that there was no evidence to support an Article 1 F (b) finding. The sole indicium of trafficking was the quantity of cocaine found in his possession. There is no presumption in law that quantity alone is sufficient to establish trafficking:
R v McCallum
, 2006 SKQB 287 at para 28. Unresolved criminal charges are, until proven otherwise, mere allegations:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 12. Further, the applicant contends, the fact that the original charge was reduced should be considered
prima facie
evidence that the applicant did not commit the crime:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[25]
The respondent submits that it was reasonable for the Board to conclude, considering the applicant's financial situation, that the purchase of a quantity of cocaine worth approximately $1200.00 (the applicant's estimate) for personal consumption was not credible. It was also open to the Board to take into account the original charge of trafficking. Considering that the maximum penalty in Canada for trafficking in a controlled substance is life imprisonment, it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the applicant had committed a serious crime. According to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA), a serious crime is to be equated with a crime which has a maximum sentence of at least 10 years of imprisonment.
[26]
Exclusion hearings under Article 1 F (b) of the Convention are not in the nature of a criminal trial:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  leave to appeal refused, [2004] SCCA No 418, at para 23.
[27]
The test of serious reasons for considering that a refugee claimant has committed a serious non-political offence within the scope of Article 1 F (b) is similar to the evidentiary standard of reasonable grounds to believe. It is more than mere suspicion but less than the civil standard of a balance of probabilities:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[28]
At the hearing of the refugee claim, counsel for the applicant filed excerpts from the Florida statutes regarding the punishment for simple possession of cocaine in that state. The offence is described as a third degree felony punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years and a $5000 fine. It was argued that the equivalent offence in Canada under the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act
is simple possession of a Schedule I substance for which the penalty on indictment is seven years or less and on summary conviction, no more than six months and a fine of up to $1000.
[29]
The informant's untested disclosure to the police was not in itself compelling and credible information on which to make a finding that the applicant possessed the cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. At best, it gave rise to suspicion calling for further investigation. It appears from the arrest that the extent of the further investigation conducted was the search of the applicant's vehicle. The applicant denied having the cocaine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking at the time of his arrest.
[30]
It was open to the Board to consider the quantity found in the applicant's possession and to find his explanation for why he had such a large quantity implausible. The Board erred in finding that the equivalent offence in Canada was trafficking under s. 5 (1) of the CDSA. The equivalent offence in Canada is possession for the purpose of trafficking under s. 5 (2). This error would not, in itself, have been material as the maximum penalty for the offence of possession for the purpose of a Schedule I substance under the CDSA is the same as that for trafficking in such a substance; life imprisonment.
[31]
I note that the Board also erred in finding that the accused pleaded guilty. The actual plea was no contest, a practice in the USA that has no direct equivalent in Canada but amounts to a concession by the defendant that on the evidence disclosed the charge can be proven. This is done without an admission of guilt. Again, the error was not material. However, the Board failed to properly take into account the disposition of the offence by the foreign court in considering whether the offence committed was serious.
[32]
Notwithstanding the seizure of a significant amount, the Florida prosecutor and court accepted a no contest plea to simple possession and imposed a suspended sentence that would be satisfied by the completion of five years of probation, drug treatment and payment of a minimal fine. The applicant testified that this was done because he was not in fact trafficking and was prepared to contest the warrantless search of his automobile. That evidence was, of course, self-serving but there is no evidence in the record to the contrary, other than the informant's untested statement.
[33]
While I don't agree with the applicant that the reduction of the charge is
prima facie
proof that he was not trafficking, the laying of a charge by the police does not establish that the crime charged was committed, as the Board appears to have assumed. In exclusion cases, police arrest reports may serve as credible and compelling evidence. But here there was no evidence of trafficking in the reports other than the informant's untested statement and none of the usual indicia of trafficking such as prior convictions or the separation of the drug into quantities suitable for sale.
[34]
The Board correctly noted that in applying the criteria set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, to interpret the seriousness of the foreign offence, it was required to take into account the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction. In referring to these criteria, the Board acknowledged that the reduction of the original charge and the "relative lighter punishment for that offence" weighs in favour of the crime being less serious.
[35]
The Board then states that the "circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence and the initial charges [sic] weigh in favour of the crime being serious." The Board does not identify the circumstances to which it is referring. Nor does it explain why the initial charge should be given greater weight than the ultimate disposition. The "relative lighter punishment" is in stark contrast with the mandatory minimum term of three years imprisonment and substantial fine that Florida imposes for trafficking in cocaine. I acknowledge that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 54, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that a probation order, particularly one of five years, is not necessarily a light sentence because of the restrictions on liberty and possibility of further consequences if breached. In this instance, however, the probation order coupled with the withheld adjudication appears to have been a lenient disposition for possession of a substantial amount of cocaine.
[36]
I find that the Board's decision with respect to exclusion lacks the justification, transparency and intelligibility that would make it reasonable within the meaning of the standard set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47.
[37]
In the event that its decision as to exclusion was in error, as I have found, the Board proceeded to an analysis of the merits of the refugee claim. This Court must do the same.
Was the Board's decision relating to the merits of the refugee claim reasonable?
[38]
The applicant submits that the Board did not explain why it did not accept the reasons he provided with regard to his delay in claiming refugee status in Canada and his failure to claim asylum in the USA. In addition, the applicant submits, the Board erred in finding that his 2010 anti-Hezbollah posts on the social media site Facebook were not public and accessible by Hezbollah militants.
[39]
In its internal flight alternative analysis, the applicant contends, the Board did not consider the small size of Lebanon, ignored letters from his friends and family in Lebanon and did not address his concern about the documented Hezbollah presence at the Beirut airport where he would arrive if deported. Overall, the applicant submits, the Board minimized the factional violence between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims in Lebanon and Hezbollah's role in controlling large portions of the country and much of the state apparatus.
[40]
It was open to the Board to consider the applicant's failure to claim asylum in the USA and his delay in claiming in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Contrary to the applicant's submissions, the Board did consider his explanation for failing to claim in the USA. The Board also considered that his delay in Canada was an informed choice made by the applicant after he had received the advice of a lawyer as to his available options. The Board found that these omissions raised concerns about the validity of his allegations of fear.
[41]
The Board considered the letters from family and friends which indicated that the applicant continued to be sought by Hezbollah and the documentary evidence about country conditions submitted by the applicant. It was open to the Board to give this evidence little weight and to make its own assessment of the country conditions based on all of the evidence.
[42]
The Board did err in finding that the Facebook posts were not publicly accessible. That error was not material in the context of the Board's overall finding that the applicant would not be a person of interest to Hezbollah fifteen years after he had left Beirut simply because he had posted criticisms online. The Board recognized that "Hezbollah generally poses a threat to people who are not supporters of their agenda" and targets certain people. However, it found that the applicant had not been politically active and posed no threat to the organization.
[43]
The determinative issue for the Board was the availability of internal flight alternatives in several cities in the north of Lebanon. The Board considered whether there was a serious possibility of persecution or harm in other parts of the country on a balance of probabilities and whether it was unreasonable, considering the circumstances, for the applicant to live in those areas:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA). The Board found that the applicant's previous problems with Hezbollah were localized to the neighbourhood in which he had been raised. While the Board did not expressly deal with the question of identification at the airport it considered the applicant's concern that he would be recognized if he returned to the south to visit his family, the main concern raised by the applicant during the hearing.
[44]
The Board was not persuaded that the applicant would face persecution or harm in the proposed internal flight alternatives or that moving to those cities would be unreasonable. I am unable to find that the Board erred in reaching those conclusions.
[45]
In conclusion, while I may have arrived at a different conclusion on the evidence I find that the Board's decision that the applicant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection was within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[46]
No serious questions of general importance were proposed by the parties and none will be certified.
JUDGMENT
[47]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application is dismissed. No questions are certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur, Wissam Mohamad Jawad, sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a refusé de lui reconnaître la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention pour cause de grande criminalité et par laquelle elle a conclu, à titre subsidiaire, qu'il n'avait pas qualité de personne à protéger, étant donné qu'il disposait de possibilités de refuge intérieur au Liban.
[2]
J'estime que la Commission a commis une erreur en refusant de reconnaître la qualité de réfugié au demandeur, mais qu'elle a tiré une conclusion raisonnable en ce qui concernait l'existence de possibilités de refuge intérieur. Pour cette raison, la demande est rejetée.
CONTEXE
[3]
M. Jawad est un citoyen du Liban. Il est né et a grandi dans un quartier de Beyrouth contrôlé par le Hezbollah, un mouvement politique musulman chiite et un parti politique. Son père était chiite, mais sa mère égyptienne appartenait à la branche sunnite de l'Islam. Le demandeur et ses frères et sœur ont suivi la tradition de leur mère. Le demandeur affirme qu'ils se faisaient harceler par leurs voisins pour cette raison. Leur mère continue à vivre dans le même quartier avec la sœur du demandeur. Son frère demeure toujours à Beyrouth.
[4]
Le demandeur affirme qu'il a eu maille à partir avec le Hezbollah à la suite du décès de son père, en 1989. Il affirme qu'une menace de mort a été proférée contre lui pour avoir vandalisé des affiches du chef du Hezbollah. En 1995, il s'est rendu aux États-Unis d'Amérique comme visiteur et a obtenu un permis de travail. Il s'est marié en 1996 et a obtenu le statut de résident permanent en 1997. Il a divorcé de sa première femme en 2000 et s'est remarié en 2002.
[5]
En 2004, le demandeur a été accusé en Floride de trafic de cocaïne à la suite d'une perquisition effectuée dans sa voiture sur la foi d'un tuyau fourni par un indicateur. On a découvert que le demandeur avait en sa possession une quantité de cocaïne variant entre 70 et 83 grammes selon les rapports des agents qui ont procédé à son arrestation. Devant le tribunal, le ministère public a modifié l'accusation et le demandeur a plaidé coupable à des accusations de possession de 70 grammes de cocaïne. Suivant la procédure appelée «
adjudication withheld
», il n'y a pas eu de déclaration formelle de culpabilité, mais le demandeur s'est vu infliger une période de probation assortie d'une recommandation de cure de désintoxication. Le demandeur a également eu à débourser 50 $ US. On ne sait pas avec certitude s'il s'agissait du paiement d'une amende ou de frais.
[6]
En avril 2006, M. Jawad a été arrêté par les autorités de l'immigration des États-Unis et a été détenu pendant quelques mois avant d'être renvoyé des États-Unis en raison de l'infraction de possession de stupéfiants. Son expulsion a été reportée en raison de la situation qui existait alors au Liban. Il a été mis en liberté en attendant que la situation évolue au Liban et il a été informé qu'il pouvait quitter de son plein gré les États-Unis. Le demandeur a choisi de quitter volontairement les États-Unis malgré le fait qu'il faisait toujours l'objet d'une ordonnance de probation de la Floride qui l'obligeait à se présenter régulièrement aux autorités.
[7]
En août 2006, le demandeur est arrivé au Canada en compagnie de sa femme et de son premier enfant. Il n'a pas révélé à l'agent d'immigration qui l'a reçu au point d'entrée le statut qu'il avait aux États-Unis, mais il a par la suite consulté un avocat de Montréal au sujet des options qui s'offraient à lui. Le couple a donné naissance à un second enfant au Canada. La femme du demandeur a cherché sans succès à obtenir la résidence au Canada pour elle-même et pour ses enfants en présentant sa demande depuis les États-Unis. Après avoir essuyé un refus, elle est demeurée aux États-Unis avec ses enfants. M. Jawad est demeuré au Canada sans statut.
[8]
À la suite de son défaut de se présenter aux autorités comme il devait le faire, M. Jawad a fait l'objet d'un mandat d'arrestation pour violation de l'ordonnance de probation qui avait été prononcée en Floride. En avril 2009, il a été mis en état d'arrestation après avoir été appréhendé pour avoir brûlé un feu rouge à Surrey (C.-B.) et il a été livré aux mains de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada. C'est alors qu'il a présenté sa demande d'asile.
[9]
Le demandeur affirme que, s'il doit retourner à quelque endroit que ce soit au Liban, il sera persécuté par le Hezbollah en raison de ses activités passées au Liban et de certaines déclarations publiques récentes. En 2010, il a publié des commentaires défavorables sur le réseau social Facebook dans lequel il critiquait le Hezbollah et son chef, Nesrallah.
[10]
À la suite de l'arrestation du demandeur en 2009, le ministre a d'abord cherché à le faire déclarer interdit de territoire en vertu de l'alinéa 36(2)
b
) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27, au motif qu'il avait été déclaré coupable, à l'extérieur du Canada, d'une infraction qui, commise au Canada, constituerait une infraction à une loi fédérale punissable d'un emprisonnement maximal d'au moins dix ans. Cette demande a été retirée. Il n'y avait donc plus de déclaration d'interdiction de territoire qui empêchait de déférer la demande d'asile à la Section de la protection des réfugiés.
DÉCISION À L'EXAMEN
[11]
La Commission a fait observer que, pour refuser de reconnaître la qualité de réfugié au demandeur par application de l'alinéa
b
) de la section F de l'article premier de la
Convention relative au statut des réfugiés
, 28 juillet 1951, 189 RTNU 137 (« la Convention »),il fallait qu'il existe des raisons sérieuses de penser qu'il avait commis un crime grave de droit commun avant d'être admis au Canada. La Commission a accordé le bénéfice du doute au demandeur en ce qui concerne la quantité de cocaïne en cause et elle a retenu le chiffre de 70 grammes.
[12]
Se fondant sur le témoignage du demandeur, la Commission a conclu que 70 grammes de cocaïne valaient environ 1 200 $ et que cette quantité était suffisante pour assurer environ six mois de consommation personnelle. La Commission a jugé invraisemblable que le demandeur ait, comme il le prétendait, acheté une quantité de cocaïne équivalant à six mois de consommation personnelle, compte tenu de sa situation financière à l'époque. La Commission a estimé que le demandeur possédait de la cocaïne en vue d'en faire le trafic malgré le fait que le tribunal de la Floride l'ait reconnu coupable de l'infraction moindre de simple possession. La Commission a justifié sa conclusion par le fait que l'alinéa
b
) de la section F de l'article premier de la Convention parle de crime« commis » et non de crime dont l'auteur a été « déclaré coupable ».
[13]
La Commission a estimé que le crime équivalent au Canada était celui de trafic de substance désignée au sens du paragraphe 5(1) de la
Loi réglementant certaines drogues et autres substances
(la LRCDAS). Le paragraphe 5(3) de la LRCDAS prévoit que la peine maximale pour une infraction au paragraphe 5(1) est l'emprisonnement à perpétuité.
[14]
La Commission a également examiné le critère de la gravité du crime énoncé dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La Commission a conclu que le fait que l'accusation ait été modifiée était un facteur qui militait en faveur du demandeur, mais que le fait qu'il n'ait pas fini de purger sa peine aux États-Unis ainsi que le type de crime dont il avait d'abord été accusé constituaient des facteurs permettant de penser qu'il s'agissait d'un crime grave. La Commission a par conséquent conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas la qualité de réfugié par application de l'alinéa
b
) de la section F de l'article premier de la Convention.
[15]
La Commission s'est demandé si le défaut du demandeur de demander l'asile aux États-Unis et le temps qu'il avait laissé s'écouler avant de demander l'asile au Canada minaient sa crédibilité. La Commission a estimé que le témoignage du demandeur n'était pas crédible sur la question de savoir si sa crainte de persécution ou de mauvais traitements à son retour au Liban était fondée.
[16]
La Commission a estimé que le demandeur disposait d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur au Liban, dans les villes de Halba, Tripoli et Albirah. La Commission a fait état du climat de violence qui régnait au Liban et de l'omniprésence du Hezbollah. Néanmoins, la Commission a conclu que, comme le demandeur n'était pas une personne connue, qu'il n'était pas actif sur le plan politique et qu'il était instruit, il pouvait raisonnablement aller s'installer dans l'une des villes en question.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[17]
Voici les questions soulevées en ce qui concerne la décision de la Commission:
a. La conclusion d'exclusion de la Commission était-elle raisonnable?
b. La décision de la Commission quant au bien-fondé de la demande d'asile était-elle raisonnable?
DISPOSITIONS LÉGISLATIVES
[18]
L'article 98 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27, est ainsi libellé:
98. La personne visée aux sections E ou F de l'article premier de la Convention sur les réfugiés ne peut avoir la qualité de réfugié ni de personne à protéger.
98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
[19]
L'alinéa
b
) de la section F de l'article premier de la
Convention relative au statut des réfugiés
, 28 juillet 1951, 189 RTNU 137, que l'on trouve à l'annexe 1 de la LIPR, dispose:
Article 1
F. Les dispositions de cette Convention ne seront pas applicables aux personnes dont on aura des raisons sérieuses de penser:
[...]
b) qu'elles ont commis un crime grave de droit commun en dehors du pays d'accueil avant d'y être admises comme réfugiés;
Article 1
F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
[...]
(
b
) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;
ANALYSE
Norme de contrôle
[20]
La norme de contrôle applicable aux questions de fait et de droit en jeu en l'espèce a déjà été arrêtée de façon satisfaisante par la jurisprudence, de sorte qu'il n'est pas nécessaire d'analyser plus en profondeur les facteurs énumérés dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[21]
La norme de contrôle applicable en ce qui concerne l'alinéa
b
) de la section F de l'article premier de la Convention est celle de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  conf. par 2008 CAF 404; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
Les décisions portant sur l'existence d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur sont également assujetties à la norme de contrôle de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
Lorsqu'une décision est contrôlée selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse porte sur l'existence d'une justification et sur la transparence et l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi que sur l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, au paragraphe 47; et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
La conclusion d'exclusion de la Commission était-elle raisonnable?
[24]
Le demandeur soutient qu'il n'y avait aucun élément de preuve pour appuyer une conclusion fondée sur l'alinéa
b
) de la section F de l'article premier. Le seul élément de preuve allant en ce sens est la quantité de cocaïne que l'on a trouvée en sa possession. Il n'y a aucune présomption de droit suivant laquelle la quantité suffit, à elle seule, pour démontrer qu'il y a eu trafic (
R c McCallum
, 2006 SKQB 287, au paragraphe 28). Des accusations criminelles sur lesquelles il n'a pas été statuées, ne sont, jusqu'à la preuve du contraire, que de simples allégations (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 12). Le demandeur affirme en outre que le fait que les accusations initiales aient été réduites devrait être considéré comme une preuve prima facie qu'il n'a pas commis ce crime (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[25]
Selon le défendeur, il était raisonnable de la part de la Commission de conclure, compte tenu de la situation financière du demandeur, qu'il n'était pas vraisemblable qu'il ait acheté une quantité de cocaïne d'une valeur approximative de 1 200 $ (estimation du demandeur) pour sa consommation personnelle. Il était également loisible à la Commission de tenir compte de l'accusation initiale de trafic. Compte tenu du fait que la peine maximale qui peut être infligée au Canada pour le trafic de substances désignées est l'emprisonnement à perpétuité, il était raisonnable de la part de la Commission de conclure que le demandeur avait commis un crime grave. Suivant l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), un crime grave est assimilable à un crime qui peut entraîner l'imposition d'une peine d'emprisonnement de dix ans ou plus.
[26]
Les audiences en matière d'exclusion qui se déroulent en vertu de l'alinéa
b
) de la section F de l'article premier de la Convention ne sont pas de la nature d'un procès en matière criminelle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  autorisation de pourvoi refusée, [2004] SCCA no 418, au paragraphe 23).
[27]
Le critère des raisons sérieuses de penser que le demandeur d'asile a commis un crime grave de droit commun au sens de l'alinéa
b
) de la section F de l'article premier s'apparente à la norme de preuve des motifs raisonnables de croire. Cette norme exige davantage que de simples soupçons, mais est moins stricte que celle de la prépondérance des probabilités en matière civile (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[28]
À l'audience relative à la demande d'asile, l'avocat du demandeur a déposé des extraits de lois de la Floride concernant les peines prévues en cas de possession simple de cocaïne dans cet État. L'infraction est qualifiée d'acte délictueux grave de troisième degré passible d'une peine maximale de cinq ans d'emprisonnement et d'une amende de 5 000 $. L'infraction équivalente au Canada est, sous le régime de la
Loi réglementant certaines drogues et autres substances
, celle de possession simple d'une substance prévue à l'annexe 1, qui est, sur acte d'accusation, passible d'une peine maximale de sept ans d'emprisonnement et, sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité, d'une peine maximale de six mois d'emprisonnement et d'une amende maximale de 1 000 $.
[29]
Non vérifié, le renseignement que l'indicateur a divulgué à la police ne constituait pas en soi un renseignement convaincant et digne de foi permettant de conclure que le demandeur avait en sa possession de la cocaïne en vue d'en faire le trafic. Il a tout au plus suscité des doutes qui justifiaient une enquête plus approfondie, ce qui s'est soldé, au moment de l'arrestation par la perquisition du véhicule du demandeur. Lors de son arrestation, le demandeur a nié avoir l'intention de faire le trafic de la cocaïne qu'il avait en sa possession.
[30]
Il était loisible à la Commission d'examiner la quantité se trouvant en la possession du demandeur et de juger invraisemblable l'explication fournie par ce dernier pour justifier la présence d'une quantité aussi importante sur lui. Toutefois, la Commission a commis une erreur en concluant que l'infraction équivalente au Canada était celle de trafic prévue au paragraphe 5(1) de la LRCDAS. L'infraction équivalente au Canada est celle de possession en vue d'en faire le trafic qui est prévue au paragraphe 5(2) de la même loi. Cette erreur ne tirait pas en soi à conséquence étant donné que la peine maximale pour l'infraction de possession d'une substance prévue à l'annexe 1 de la LRCDAS était la même que celle dont se rend passible l'auteur de l'infraction de trafic de cette substance, en l'occurrence, l'emprisonnement à perpétuité.
[31]
Je constate que la Commission a également commis une erreur en concluant que l'accusé avait plaidé coupable. En réalité, il a inscrit un plaidoyer de
nolo contendere
(«
no contest
»), qui n'a pas d'équivalent direct au Canada, mais qui revient pour l'accusé à admettre, suivant la preuve révélée, que l'accusation peut être démontrée. Ce plaidoyer n'est pas assorti d'un aveu de culpabilité. Là encore, cette erreur ne tirait pas à conséquence. Toutefois, la Commission n'a pas tenu compte comme elle le devait de la décision rendue par la juridiction étrangère au sujet de l'infraction lorsqu'elle s'est demandé si l'infraction qui avait été commise était grave.
[32]
Malgré l'importance de la quantité de drogue saisie, le ministère public et le tribunal de la Floride ont accepté un plaidoyer de «
no contest
» en réponse à une accusation de possession simple et le demandeur s'est vu infliger une peine avec sursis à être purgée une fois remplies les trois conditions suivantes: cinq ans de probation, cure de désintoxication et paiement de l'amende minimale. Le demandeur a expliqué que cette mesure avait été prise parce qu'il ne faisait pas en réalité le trafic de stupéfiants et qu'il était prêt à contester la perquisition sans mandat de son automobile. Il s'agissait évidemment d'un témoignage intéressé, mais il n'existe au dossier aucune preuve à part les affirmations non vérifiées de l'indicateur.
[33]
Bien que je ne sois pas d'accord avec le demandeur pour dire que la réduction de l'accusation constitue une preuve prima facie qu'il ne s'adonnait pas au trafic, le fait que la police ait déposé des accusations ne constitue pas une preuve que le crime reproché a été commis, comme la Commission semble l'avoir supposé. En pareille matière, les rapports d'arrestation de police peuvent servir d'éléments de preuve crédibles et convaincants. Il n'y avait toutefois dans les rapports en question aucun élément de preuve permettant de conclure au trafic, si l'on fait exception de la déclaration non vérifiée de l'indicateur, et l'on ne trouvait aucun des indices habituels de trafic tels que des condamnations antérieures ou la répartition des stupéfiants en quantités propices à la vente.
[34]
La Commission a fait observer à juste titre que suivant le critère énoncé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, il fallait, pour déterminer la gravité de l'infraction commise à l'étranger, tenir compte des éléments constitutifs du crime, du mode de poursuite, de la peine prévue, des faits et des facteurs atténuants et aggravants à la base de la condamnation. En se référant à ces facteurs, la Commission a reconnu que la réduction de l'accusation initiale et le fait que « la peine pour ce crime était relativement légère » militaient en faveur de la conclusion qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un crime grave.
[35]
La Commission affirme ensuite que « les circonstances relatives à la perpétration de l'infraction et le chef d'accusation initial attestent qu'il s'agit d'un crime grave ». La Commission ne précise pas en quoi consistent les circonstances auxquelles elle fait allusion. Elle n'explique pas non plus pourquoi les chefs d'accusation initiaux devraient se voir accorder une plus grande importance que la décision finale. La « peine relativement légère » contraste vivement avec la peine obligatoire minimale de trois ans d'emprisonnement et avec la forte amende prévue par la loi de la Floride pour trafic de cocaïne. Je reconnais que, dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 54, la Cour d'appel fédérale a fait observer qu'une ordonnance de probation ne constitue pas une peine légère, surtout dans le cas d'une probation de cinq ans, étant donné les restrictions à la liberté et la possibilité de subir d'autres conséquences en cas de violation de l'ordonnance. Dans le cas qui nous occupe toutefois, le fait que le demandeur se soit vu infliger par le tribunal une période de probation sans déclaration formelle de culpabilité semble avoir constitué une décision clémente, s'agissant de la possession d'une quantité importante de cocaïne.
[36]
J'estime que la conclusion d'exclusion de la Commission ne répond pas au critère de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité qui en ferait une décision raisonnable au sens de la norme énoncée par la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ci-dessus, au paragraphe 47.
[37]
La Commission a poursuivi en analysant le bien-fondé de la demande d'asile pour le cas où sa conclusion d'exclusion serait - comme je le crois - erronée. Notre Cour doit faire de même.
La décision de la Commission quant au bien-fondé de la demande d'asile était-elle raisonnable?
[38]
Le demandeur soutient que la Commission n'a pas expliqué pourquoi elle n'acceptait pas les motifs qu'il a invoqués pour expliquer son retard à demander l'asile au Canada et pourquoi il ne l'avait pas demandé aux États-Unis. Le demandeur ajoute, par ailleurs, que la Commission a commis une erreur en concluant que les propos qu'il avait publiés sur le réseau social Facebook pour critiquer le Hezbollah en 2010 n'étaient pas publics et que les militants du Hezbollah n'y avaient pas accès.
[39]
Le demandeur affirme que, dans son analyse de la possibilité de refuge intérieur, la Commission n'a pas tenu compte du fait que le Liban est un petit pays, des lettres que ses amis et des membres de sa famille se trouvant au Liban lui ont écrites, et de ses préoccupations au sujet de la présence du Hezbollah à l'aéroport de Beyrouth, le point d'arrivée advenant son expulsion du Canada, confirmée par la preuve documentaire. Le demandeur affirme que, dans l'ensemble, la Commission a minimisé le phénomène de la violence sectaire au Liban mettant en cause les musulmans sunnites et chiites, de même que le rôle que joue le Hezbollah, qui contrôle de grandes parties du pays et l'essentiel de l'appareil de l'État.
[40]
Il était loisible à la Commission de tenir compte du fait que le demandeur n'avait pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis et qu'il avait tardé à présenter sa demande d'asile au Canada (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Contrairement à ce que prétend le demandeur, la Commission a effectivement tenu compte des explications qu'il a fournies pour expliquer pourquoi il n'avait pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis. La Commission a également tenu compte du délai qu'il a laissé s'écouler avant de demander l'asile au Canada en estimant qu'il s'agissait d'un choix éclairé fait par le demandeur après avoir été informé par un avocat des choix qui s'offraient à lui. La Commission a estimé que ces omissions soulèvent des doutes quant à la véracité des allégations de crainte du demandeur.
[41]
La Commission a examiné les lettres écrites par des membres de sa famille et par ses amis indiquant que le demandeur était toujours recherché par le Hezbollah. La Commission a également tenu compte de la preuve documentaire portant sur la situation au pays que le demandeur lui avait soumise. Il était loisible à la Commission d'accorder peu de poids à ces éléments de preuve et de procéder à sa propre évaluation de la situation au Liban en se fondant sur l'ensemble de la preuve.
[42]
La Commission a bel et bien commis une erreur en concluant que les commentaires publiés sur Facebook n'étaient pas accessibles au public. Cette erreur ne tirait pas à conséquence compte tenu de la conclusion générale de la Commission suivant laquelle le Hezbollah ne s'intéresserait pas au demandeur quinze ans après son départ de Beyrouth du simple fait qu'il avait publié des critiques en ligne. La Commission a reconnu que « le Hezbollah présente généralement une menace pour les personnes qui n'appuient pas ses objectifs » et qu'il cible certaines personnes. La Commission a toutefois conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas été actif sur le plan politique et qu'il ne représentait aucune menace pour cette organisation.
[43]
La question déterminante aux yeux de la Commission était la possibilité de refuge intérieur dont disposait le demandeur dans diverses villes du nord du Liban. La Commission s'est demandé s'il existait une possibilité sérieuse que le demandeur subisse des persécutions ou de mauvais traitements ailleurs au pays suivant la prépondérance des probabilités et s'il était déraisonnable, dans les circonstances, que le demandeur habite dans ces régions (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF)). La Commission a conclu que les démêlés que le demandeur avait eus par le passé avec le Hezbollah se limitaient au quartier dans lequel il avait grandi. Bien que la Commission n'ait pas abordé directement la question de l'identification à l'aéroport, elle a traité des craintes formulées par le demandeur quant au risque qu'on le reconnaisse s'il retournait dans le sud rendre visite à sa famille, répondant ainsi à la principale préoccupation exprimée par le demandeur à l'audience.
[44]
La Commission n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur pourrait faire l'objet de persécutions ou de mauvais traitements aux endroits proposés comme possibilités de refuge intérieur, ni que le fait d'aller s'installer dans les villes en question serait déraisonnable. Il m'est impossible de conclure que la Commission a commis une erreur en tirant ces conclusions.
[45]
Pour conclure, bien que j'eusse pu en arriver à une conclusion différente vu l'ensemble de la preuve, j'estime que la décision de la Commission suivant laquelle le demandeur n'a pas la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger appartenait aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[46]
Aucune question grave de portée générale n'a été proposée par les parties et aucune ne sera donc certifiée.
