Muldoon, J.
: Two diametrically opposing motions have been brought before the Court. The plaintiffs move, pursuant to Rule 438, for leave to enter judgment in default of pleading on the part of the named defendant Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc. (hereinafter: MAA). That defendant, MMA moves for orders (i) granting MAA, pursuant to Rule 401, leave to file a conditional appearance for the purpose of objecting to the purported service of the statement of claim on it; and a stay of proceedings to allow such objection to be raised and adjudicated, and (ii) finding that MAA has not been served in the manner prescribed by the Rules of this Court.
[2]
At the outset of the hearing, counsel for the plaintiffs expressed, on their behalf, consent to the granting of leave to the defendant MAA for a conditional appearance for the cited purpose. Because of that consent, and for the reasons which follow, the plaintiff's motion for default judgment will be dismissed for prematurity, but without costs; and leave will be granted, by consent, to MAA; and its motion to set aside service of the statement of claim will be dismissed but with costs in its favour payable by the plaintiffs.
[3]
Both counsel confirmed that service has been effected in regard to the three defendants other than MAA and such service is apparently not disputed. Apparently none of those three other defendants has as yet filed a statement of defence, for their solicitors are negotiating with the plaintiffs' solicitors for particulars and for security for their costs to be deposited by the foreign plaintiff. Those matters are worthy of note as it will appear, but they are of no direct consequence in this proceeding.
[4]
The plaintiffs purport to have effected service of their statement of claim on MAA through the defendants John Shirley and Shamrock Chemicals. In an affidavit of service sworn on June 17, 1986, one J. Michael Deane, of London, Ontario, an articled student-at-law, swore:
"1. That I did on the 2nd day of April in 1986 serve Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc., one of the above-named Defendants, with papers which purported to be a certified copy of the Amended Statement of Claim filed in this cause in this Court on the 13th day of February, 1986 and a copy of Canadian Patent No. 1,081,256 and Disclaimer by delivering to and leaving the said certified copy and copy of the patent and Disclaimer with John Shirley, an officer of Shamrock Chemicals (Canada) Limited and Shamrock Chemicals Limited at 595 Exeter Road, London, Ontario."
[5]
In this regard, the plaintiffs invoke Rule 310(2) which runs thus:
"310.(2) Where a person resident outside Canada who, in the ordinary course of his business, enters into contracts in Canada or enters into business transactions in Canada (as, for example, when a carrier receives goods in Canada for transport to some place outside Canada) and, in that connection, regularly makes use of the services of a person or persons resident in Canada, is sued in respect of any cause of action arising out of such a contract or transaction, personal service of the statement of claim or declaration or other document in the action upon any such person whose services the defendant actually made use of in connection with the contract or transaction in question shall be deemed to be personal service on the defendant as though an order had been duly made for substitutional service in that manner in the particular case."
The plaintiffs complied with the provisions of Rule 310(3) by attaching to the copy of the statement of claim intended for MAA, a notice reciting the full text of paragraph (2).
[6]
Mr. Deane's affidavit is the sole deposition by which the plaintiffs seek to establish compliance with Rule 310(2). MAA's solicitors attack that affidavit, urging that it is quite inadequate, being as they allege, far too diluted by hearsay and, even if accepted as completely factual, still far short of establishing a proper basis for service according to Rule 310(2). Mr. Deane was cross-examined on his affidavit of service and particularly in regard to paragraph 7 thereof.
[7]
Paragraph 7 is founded on Mr. Deane's professed information and belief, thus:
"7. I am informed by Peter Winnett, Vice-President and Director of Plant Operations of the Plaintiff Eli Lilly Canada Inc. and believe the following:
(a) The address of Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc. is 2 Park Avenue, New York, New York, 10016, U.S.A.;
(b) Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc. is in the business of supplying agricultural chemicals and in the ordinary course of business sells an agricultural chemical, trifluralin, in Canada;
(c) Mahkteshim-Agan (America), Inc. carries out business transactions in Canada with John Shirley, Shamrock Chemicals Limited and Shamrock Chemicals (Canada) Limited for the formulation and sale of an agricultural herbicide marketed under the name TRIFLUREX 40 EC.
(d) Mahkteshim-Agan (America), Inc. supplies trifluralin which is formulated into the final product by Shamrock Chemicals Limited and Shamrock Chemicals (Canada) Limited.
(e) The trifluralin is marketed under the Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc. trademark TRIFLUREX and under the registration of Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc. under the Pest Control Products Act as registration No. 17223.
(f) Exhibit 'C' is a copy of the product label and Exhibit 'D' is a copy of the Directions For Use of the Product Triflurex.
(g) Exhibits 'E', 'F' and 'G' are respectively Triflurex Report # 2 dated August 1985, Triflurex Report # 2 dated December 1985 and a letter from Spra-All Manufacturing, a division of Shamrock Chemicals Limited all of which are dealing with the offering for sale of Triflurex herbicide.
(h) It is apparent from the documents that the relationship between Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc. on the one hand and John Shirley, Shamrock Chemicals Limited and Shamrock Chemicals (Canada) Limited on the other is an ongoing one.
(i) The Plaintiffs allege that the trifluralin contained in the Triflurex product is made by a process which infringes Canadian Patent No. 1,081,256."
[8]
Exhibit "C" to Mr. Deane's affidavit links the impugned product, Triflurex 40 EC and the registration No. 17223 pursuant to the Pest Control Products Act, with the defendant Shamrock Chemicals (Canada) Limited, whose given address is the place at which Mr. Deane attended upon the defendant John Shirley. Exhibit "D", Directions for Use of Triflurex 40 EC, copyright 1985 by MAA, recites and particular registration number above mentioned, and is composed and issued by MAA of the same address as previously recited. Exhibit "E" is a copy of TRIFLUREX REPORT # 2 issued by Ken Goudy Agri-Chemicals of Melfort, Saskatchewan, dated August, 1985, and referring to MAA "our supplier". Exhibit "F" is another TRIFLUREX REPORT # 2 issued again in Saskatchewan over the name of the same person who signed Exhibit "E", dated December, 1985, and containing these words: "By purchasing some of this inventory you also get us off the hot seat with Shamrock and Mekhteshim. I am sure you can understand that we need to keep our relationship with them as friendly as possible." Exhibit "G" is a copy of a letter issued by Spra' All Manufacturing a Division of Shamrock Chemicals Ltd., displaying addresses in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, dated February 13, 1986, and promoting Triflurex 40 EC for the addressee's "economical choice for TRIFLURALIN herbicide ...".
[9]
The applicant MAA does not raise any objection against the authenticity of those exhibits, and so, they can be safely received as objective evidence, regardless of Mr. Deane's lack of knowledge about them or his belief in their authenticity which is founded only upon hearsay. Proof in this civil case does not need to be established beyond a reasonable doubt, but merely on a balance of probability.
[10]
On this evidence it is entirely probable that MAA "in the ordinary course of [its] business, enters into contracts in Canada or enters into business transactions in Canada ... and, in that connection, regularly makes use of the services of [the defendants John Shirley and Shamrock Chemicals, who are] resident in Canada ... whose services the defendant actually made use of in connection with the contract or transaction in question", that is the importation, promotion and sale of the product which is allegedly "treated according to the process of Canadian Patent 1,081,256 as disclaimed" according to paragraph 10 of the statement of claim. Indeed, in Exhibit "G" the addressee is invited to compare "Eli Lily's [sic] TREFLAN". In the absence of contrary objective evidence or denial on the part of MAA, the standard of proof here is quite sufficient to comply with the criteria exacted by Rule 310(2). This conclusion appears to accord with, or at least, not to run counter to, the brief judgment unanimously expressed by the Appeal Division in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[11]
Although the objective evidence tendered as exhibits to the affidavit of service here is sufficient for compliance with Rule 310(2), counsel for MAA nevertheless contended that the affidavit is inadequate because paragraph 7, a deposition made on information and belief, ought not properly to be burdened with such matters of importance when, as it appears from the cross-examination, Mr. Winnett was quite available for the purpose of swearing a deposition about the very matters which he orally related to Mr. Deane. Reference was made to Rule 332(1). In that regard the opinion of Mr. Justice Pratte, writing for a unanimous panel of the Appeal Division in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 11; 33 C.P.C. 230 (Fed. C.A.), is instructive. As reported at p. 369 (F.C.), he opined:
"Counsel for the appellant argued that the affidavit ... was not admissible in evidence because there existed no special circumstances warranting the filing of an affidavit on information and belief. In support of that argument, counsel referred to the recent decision of Mahoney, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [T.D.] and to the following dictum of Thurlow, A.C.J. (As he then was) in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [T.D.], at page 480:
'It seems to have become a common practice in preparing material for use in interlocutory applications to ignore the first clause of this Rule and to use the second clause as a device to avoid the swearing of an affidavit by a person who knows the facts in favour of putting what he knows before the Court in the form of hearsay sworn by someone who knows nothing of them. This is not the object of the Rule. The Court is entitled to the sworn statement of the person who has personal knowledge of the facts when he is available. The second part of the Rule is merely permissive and is for use only when the best evidence, that is to say the oath of the person who knows, is for some acceptable or obvious reason not readily obtainable.'
"I cannot agree with that submission. In my opinion, Rule 332(1) imposes only two conditions for the admissibility of affidavit evidence of belief: first, that the affidavit be filed on an interlocutory motion; and second, that the deponent indicate in his affidavit the grounds of his belief. Once those conditions are met, the affidavit evidence is, in my view, admissible even though it may have little or no weight or probative value."
[12]
In view of the second grounds posited by Pratte, J., the affidavit of service in question is not defunct but very, very weak, as the plaintiffs' solicitors ought to have realized. The ground of Mr. Deane's belief was having been informed by Mr. Winnett a highly placed and, inferentially, a knowledgeable officer of the Canadian plaintiff. How Mr. Deane came by this information - including the cogent and uncontradicted objective evidence - was further elaborated on cross-examination, but an attentive appreciation of the objective evidence which he tendered may, by reasonable inference, serve as a ground of his belief in compliance with Rule 332(1).
[13]
This manner of compliance with Rules 310(2) and 332(1) is barely acceptable, but just barely. On the other hand, the plaintiffs' position is not weakened in this regard by the dictum of Mr. Justice Walsh in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  cross-examining on an affidavit or dealing with an examination for discovery, should not seek information of which they themselves have full knowledge or embark on fishing expeditions in an attempt to determine what knowledge plaintiffs have of defendants' business or products."
That salutary principle affords good reason to accept the objective evidence tendered with the affidavit, since the matters on which Mr. Deane was cross-examined were those of which MAA must have full knowledge but which it did not purport to contradict. It places no undue onus upon MAA to expect it to contradict inaccurate evidence or false documents if it could do so, for the onus resting on the plaintiffs is discharged here in the absence of any such contradiction.
[14]
It has been contended that strict compliance with the provisions of Rule 332(1) and especially Rule 310(2) is required in order to establish the Court's jurisdiction over the defendant in matters such as this. Generally speaking all activities, transactions and things happening and being in Canada, insofar as contemplated by validly enacted federal laws, including the Federal Court Act, are within the judicial competence of this Court. Insofar as it operates, transacts business or imports products in and into Canada, even a foreign defendant comes under the Court's jurisdiction so long as that foreign defendant is aware of having been impleaded and is accorded an opportunity to respond in his, her or its own interest. The purpose of proving service of an originating document is to demonstrate to the Court that a defendant or respondent has been accorded such an opportunity. It is the according of that opportunity to respond, through an awareness of the content of the originating document with appropriate procedural notices appended which, strictly considered, establishes the Court's jurisdiction. The criteria expressed in Rule 310(2) are the standard means by which the Court may ascertain, or at least ordinarily presume, that a defendant or respondent has been made aware of having been sued or otherwise impleaded and has been accorded the opportunity to respond. In interpreting and applying the Rules, the Court and those who appear before it ought to keep in mind the fundamental intent of all of the several and particular provisions thereof:
"2.(2) These Rules are intended to render effective the substantive law and to ensure that it is carried out; and they are to be so interpreted and applied as to facilitate rather than to delay or to end prematurely the normal advancement of cases."
In the circumstances of this case, Rule 2(2) supports further reasons, if further reasons be needed, for validating service of the statement of claim on MAA. It is clearly obvious, from that defendant's examination of the affidavit of service to which a copy of the statement of claim is attached, and from the cross-examination of the affiant Mr. Deane upon that affidavit, and indeed from MAA's silence in regard to the objective evidence, the exhibits, that MAA was made aware of the allegations in the statement of claim by which it is being sued. Its opportunity to respond is still current, even after its utilizing the intervening time for the purpose of contesting service, as it was entitled to do. It is clearly obvious that it was served, despite its quarrel with the means undertaken to effect service. There is a strong and reasonable inference that Mr. Shirley and/or Shamrock Chemicals did precisely that which is contemplated by Rule 310(2).
[15]
According to the judgment in the Lumonics Research case, above cited, the plaintiffs were entitled to tender Mr. Deane's affidavit in compliance with Rule 332(1), but in these circumstances it is surely bad practice to attempt to demonstrate compliance with Rule 310(2) by burdening that articled student, or any other mere process server, with such a task.
[16]
Persons who attempt to effect service of documents are messengers engaged to deliver documents to designated persons, firms or corporations and, if need be, to verify on oath what they did in that regard. Normally, that ought to be the full extent of their testimony.
[17]
It is nowhere exacted that one must show compliance with Rule 310(2) by means of one, and only one affidavit. It is nowhere exacted that such compliance must be demonstrated by the testimony of a law student, bailiff or other process server. Indeed it asks too much of such messengers to require them to carry the burden of demonstrating compliance with Rule 310(2). That is a task to be performed, if at all possible, by a more knowledgeable officer, employee or other witness for the originating party.
[18]
The plaintiffs are not to be denied their right to impose that hearsay burden on the law student in this case, but the Court is also entitled to evidence disapproval of their manner of invoking the Rules. Although it is not certain, it is nevertheless possible that these proceedings might have been avoided if the more knowledgeable Mr. Winnett had taken his oath on the matter and tendered the objective evidence. In order to mark its disapproval of the plaintiffs' manner of invoking Rules 332(1) and 310(2), the Court in the exercise of its discretion awards the costs of and incidental to MAA's motion in favour of that defendant, notwithstanding the dismissal of its motion.
[19]
The effect is that the defendant MAA, having been certifiably duly served, it now stands on the same footing as the other three defendants; and one expects that the plaintiffs will not seek to obtain default judgment against MAA any sooner than they will against the other defendants or upon any conditions or circumstances different from those in which the other defendants are involved. Such at least was the Court's understanding of matters upon canvassing counsel upon the consequences of the various possible results of these proceedings. In any event, the plaintiffs shall first pay the costs awarded to MAA herein before they ever attempt to obtain default judgment. If MAA does not present its bill for taxation before the close of business of the tenth juridical day after the day upon which these reasons and consequent order are entered, then the plaintiffs' solicitors may tender their reasonable, professional detailed estimate of such costs and pay the total thereof to MAA through its solicitors; and the plaintiffs may thereupon treat the matter as if the defendant MAA had received its taxed costs and thereupon, if there be no other impediment of negotiation or procedure, be at liberty to move for default judgment, if so advised.
Order accordingly.
