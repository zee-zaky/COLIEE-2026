[1]
Pinard, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review of a decision by an adjudicator for the Public Service Labour Relations Board (PSLRB) presented in accordance with section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, by the Attorney General of Canada (applicant). The adjudicator allowed the four grievances filed by Raymond Robitaille (respondent).
[2]
The respondent has been employed by the Department of Transport since 1990. He is Manager, Railway Operations and Equipment, Surface Services, Quebec Region, and is classified as a TI-08.
[3]
On April 16, 2004, Colette Deslauriers filed a harassment complaint against the respondent, who was her superior. The respondent was informed of this complaint by a letter dated July 6, 2004. He and Ms. Deslauriers were informed of the investigator's name on August 13, 2004.
[4]
On November 26, 2004, Ms. Deslauriers sent the Director of Human Resources a document in which she included eleven new allegations of harassment against the respondent. On December 22, the Director and Ms. Deslauriers worked together to develop a new document containing the new allegations. The respondent received this document on January 3, 2005, and the investigation was launched on January 4, 2005.
[5]
The investigators met with Ms. Deslauriers on January 10, 2005. They then met with eleven other witnesses before meeting with the respondent on January 24, 2005. The respondent gave them a binder containing several documents to rebut Ms. Deslauriers' allegations. As a cost-saving measure, the investigators did not record the portions of the respondent's testimony with respect to the excerpts from the binder, which was not submitted to the employer with the investigation report.
[6]
On February 21, 2005, Hélène Gagnon, the respondent's line superior, sent him an email ordering him to no longer report to work but to telework. In early March 2005, the respondent received a copy of the preliminary report. He sent his written reply on March 20, 2005, and believes that it was disregarded by investigators. On March 16, 2005, Dr. Yves Faucher ordered the respondent to stop working for an indeterminate period because of his alleged stress and depression. The applicant claims that no reason was provided in Dr. Faucher's report.
[7]
On April 26, 2005, the respondent received a copy of the investigation report which maintained that ten out of the sixteen facts presented were consistent with the definition of harassment. On May 5, 2005, the respondent asked the Director of Human Resources about the recourse available to contest the report. His request remained unanswered. On May 18, 2005, management met with the respondent to inform him that he would not be reinstated in his managerial position or in any other position requiring managerial responsibilities on his return from sick leave.
[8]
On May 29, 2005, the respondent filed his first grievance contesting the unfairness of the investigation and the decision to not reinstate him in his position. On June 7, 2005, Ms. Gagnon imposed a second disciplinary action on the respondent, a 15-day suspension without pay. On June 22, 2005, the respondent filed a second grievance contesting this suspension. Ms. Gagnon dismissed the grievances at the first level of the grievance process. The grievances were subsequently dismissed at the second level.
[9]
On September 6, 2005, on his return from sick leave, the respondent had to report to Dorval to work within the Transportation Security and Emergency Preparedness group. The position in Dorval did not involve managerial responsibilities and the respondent had very few tasks to complete. Furthermore, this position was classified at a simple TI-06 level even though the respondent's salary and classification level remained unchanged. The 15-day suspension occurred from September 12 to September 30 inclusively.
[10]
On October 4, 2005, the Regional Director of Human Resources gave the respondent a 2-year term employment offer under the Special Assignment Pay Plan (SAPP). The Director informed the respondent that if he did not accept this offer, he would be involuntarily transferred to a position inferior to his. On November 9, 2005, Nicole Pageot, Regional Director General of Transport Canada, tried to obtain an exclusion order allowing for the involuntary transfer of the respondent. However, such an order was not permitted. In January 2006, the respondent's office in Montréal was emptied even though he still held his substantive position.
[11]
The third level of the grievance process took place on March 17, 2006. On June 20, 2006, because the respondent had not yet received any response, he referred his two grievances to the PSLRB for adjudication. The decision at the third level was supposed to have been rendered by June 2, 2006. However, it was not rendered until July 6, 2006, and the respondent did not receive it until July 17, 2006. In that decision, the employer had reduced the 15-day suspension to a written reprimand but had upheld the transfer to the Dorval office. On August 23, 2006, the respondent thus formulated a third grievance concerning this written reprimand.
[12]
On November 29, 2006, Ms. Gagnon met with the respondent to talk to him about returning to his position on the condition that he agreed to correct the behaviour described in the investigation report. Because the respondent was still challenging the allegations in the report, the third grievance was referred to adjudication on December 18, 2006.
[13]
In mid-December 2006, Ms. Gagnon assigned a "management coach" to the respondent. The coaching sessions started in May 2007 and resulted in a recommendation that the respondent resume his supervisory duties.
[14]
On June 22, 2007, the respondent filed a psychological harassment complaint against Ms. Gagnon. Management refused to investigate the matter.
[15]
On October 3, 2007, Ms. Gagnon met with the respondent to give him a [translation] "Remedial Plan for Reinstatement" according to which the respondent could be reinstated in his position two years later. On October 17, 2007, the respondent rejected this plan and, on October 24, 2007, filed a fourth grievance against it.
[16]
The four grievances referred to adjudication are properly summarized in the adjudicator's decision at the following paragraphs:
[5] The first grievance (PSLRB File No. 566-02-421) challenges the final report of the investigation into the allegations set out in the complaint. The grievor alleges a lack of procedural fairness, bias by the investigators, an incomplete report and, consequently, unfounded conclusions. The grievor requests reinstatement in his managerial position, the removal of all references to the complaint from his personnel record, and the reimbursement of all costs, expenses and professional fees incurred for his defence.
[6] The second grievance (PSLRB File No. 566-02-420) disputes the 15-day disciplinary suspension resulting from the investigation report finding that the harassment allegations against the grievor were founded. The grievor requests reinstatement in his managerial position and the reimbursement of all present and future financial losses.
[7] The third grievance (PSLRB File No. 566-02-710) disputes the conclusions of a letter of reprimand, which replaced the 15-day suspension and that the grievor alleges is a disguised disciplinary action because it reiterates and deals with untimely incidents that were set aside at the final level by another grievance decision (PSLRB File No. 566-02-420). The grievor requests that the relentless and discriminatory tactics against him as a result of the investigation cease, that a statement be made that the investigation and its findings were vitiated, that the written reprimand be withdrawn, that he be reinstated in his managerial position, and that he be reimbursed for all financial losses incurred.
[8] The fourth grievance (PSLRB File No. 566-02-1777) takes issue with the October 3, 2007, remedial plan that the employer wants to impose on the grievor as a condition of possible reinstatement in his managerial position. The grievor alleges that the remedial plan is directly linked to the vitiated findings of the complaint investigation report on the basis of which final disciplinary action was imposed on the grievor 29 months ago. The grievor alleges that the remedial plan constitutes disguised disciplinary action as well as a double penalty that has financial consequences. The grievor requests damages in the amount of $112 000, the reimbursement of all the sick leave credits that he has taken since April 2004, the reinstatement in his managerial position, a statement that the investigation was vitiated, the removal of all references to the complaint or its consequences from his personnel record, the reimbursement of all costs, expenses and professional fees incurred for his defence, a letter of apology for the harm that he has suffered, and compensatory, exemplary and punitive damages amounting to $1 895 000.
[17]
The hearing concerning the first three grievances began on January 8, 2008, before adjudicator Michele A. Pineau. The employer did not object to combining the grievances. The fourth grievance was added on January 25, 2008. Since the issues raised by the grievances were interrelated, the grievances were therefore joined for the purposes of the hearing.
[18]
In a very detailed decision, the adjudicator dismissed the employer's objections with respect to her jurisdiction and allowed the respondent's four grievances. The decision summarized the testimony of each witness regarding Ms. Deslauriers' complaints and found that none of them should have been accepted. The adjudicator also raised contradictions and inconsistencies in Ms. Deslauriers' testimony and therefore chose to believe the respondent instead.
[19]
After recognizing her jurisdiction and allowing the grievances, the adjudicator ordered the following relief:
[349] With respect to the imposition of unjustified disciplinary action, namely, a demotion, I order the following:
- the grievor is reinstated in his position as Manager, Railway Operations and Equipment, in downtown Montreal, retroactive to September 6, 2005, without any penalty or other consequence;
- all actions that were grieved are rescinded, as though they never existed;
- the deputy head must remove any mention of Ms. Deslauriers' complaint and the investigation from the grievor's personnel record and any other record related to him; and
- the deputy head must compensate the grievor for any loss of overtime since September 6, 2005, by an amount calculated on the basis of average overtime worked for the three years before the grievor's reassignment to Dorval.
[350] With respect to the harm to the grievor's health caused by the stress of an unjustified investigation, I order the deputy head to reinstate the grievor's sick leave credits that he used between March 16 and September 6, 2005.
[351] With respect to the losses incurred for daily travel time and transportation expenses, I order the deputy head to pay the grievor the following:
- the grievor's kilometrage costs between his home and his office in Dorval since September 6, 2005;
- travel time, up to two hours per day, for each day worked in Dorval since September 6, 2005.
[352] With respect to the grievor's career, I order the deputy head, at its expense, to have a human resources expert conduct a financial assessment of the grievor's loss of career advancement opportunities since September 6, 2005, and to reimburse the grievor for any loss of pay and benefits, including pension benefits, which resulted from that loss of advancement.
[353] With respect to the loss of personal property incurred by the grievor to pay fees and expenses to his counsel, I order that an actuarial assessment of the loss incurred be carried out, at the deputy head's expense, and I order the deputy head to reimburse the grievor the actuarial value of that loss.
[354] With respect to the wrongful acts by the deputy head, namely, malicious, reprehensible and harmful conduct toward the grievor, I order the deputy head to pay the grievor the amount of $50 000 in punitive damages.
[355] I remain seized of this case for 90 days following the rendering of this decision to deal with any disagreement between the parties, including the choice of a human resources expert, an actuary, the actuarial values and the calculation of the amounts ordered.

[21]
The applicant's arguments raise the following issues:
a. Did the adjudicator exceed her jurisdiction by hearing the grievance related to the written reprimand?
b. Did the adjudicator exceed her jurisdiction by hearing the grievance related to the remedial plan?
c. Did the adjudicator err by finding that the respondent suffered harm to his health caused by the stress of an unjustified investigation?
d. Did the adjudicator err by ordering the deputy head to carry out, at the deputy head's expense, a financial assessment of the respondent's loss of career advancement opportunities and to reimburse him for any loss of pay and benefits, including pension benefits, which resulted from that loss of advancement?
e. Did the adjudicator err in law by ordering the deputy head to carry out, at the deputy head's expense, an actuarial assessment of the loss of personal property incurred by the respondent to pay fees and expenses to his counsel and to reimburse him the actuarial value of that loss?
f. Did the adjudicator err by ordering the deputy head to pay the respondent the amount of $50,000 in punitive damages?
[22]
The standard of review applicable to a question of law or excess of jurisdiction of an adjudicator under the PSLRA is correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 11 et seq. and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Court must therefore determine "whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47).
I. Analysis
A.
Jurisdiction of the adjudicator with respect to the grievance related to the written reprimand
[24]
The evidence shows that, on July 6, 2006, the employer reduced the disciplinary action of a 15-day suspension without pay to a written reprimand and this decision was confirmed by Ms. Gagnon in a letter addressed to the respondent dated July 13, 2006. The respondent subsequently filed his grievance against this written reprimand on August 24, 2006.
[25]
Section 208 of the PSLRA allows an employee who feels aggrieved to present a grievance against any matter affecting his or her conditions of employment.
[26]
I agree with the applicant that any grievance presented pursuant to section 208 of the PSLRA is not necessarily arbitrable. Parliament specified at section 209 of the PSLRA that only grievances related to the matters in paragraphs 209(1)(
a
), (
b
), (
c
) and (
d
) may be referred to adjudication.
[27]
More specifically, regarding disciplinary actions, Parliament decided that only grievances disputing the most severe disciplinary actions may be referred to adjudication. Under paragraph 209(1)(
b
) of the PSLRA, only a grievance against a disciplinary action resulting in termination, demotion, suspension or financial penalty may be referred to adjudication.
[28]
A written reprimand, though a disciplinary action, does not result in the consequences listed in paragraph 209(1)(
b
) of the PSLRA and, consequently, a grievance related to a written reprimand cannot be referred to adjudication. The Federal Court confirmed this interpretation in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
. . . In enacting this provision Parliament clearly intended to limit and define the cases in which an employee, whether or not he was a member of a union, would be entitled to submit his grievance to this method of adjudication which it was establishing and entrusting to the supervision of the Board that it had just created. It is clear that Parliament did not intend all grievances to require the intervention of an official adjudicator in addition to the levels of the ordinary procedure. . . . By expressing itself as it did, Parliament appears to me to have intended to begin with an overall consideration of all grievances involving disciplinary action against individuals and then to eliminate all but those dealing with disciplinary action entailing discharge, suspension or a financial penalty. . . . .
[29]
This interpretation was also adopted by the PSLRB in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  kind of grievances that may be referred to adjudication. Only disciplinary action that has resulted in a short time, in suspension, a financial penalty, termination of employment or demotion may be referred to adjudication.
[8] The letter of reprimand does not constitute a penalty giving entitlement to a reference to adjudication, although it does indeed constitute disciplinary action which, in the context of a system of progressive discipline, could one day justify the imposition of harsher penalties.
[30]
Considering that the letter of reprimand in question did not result in a termination, demotion, suspension or financial penalty, and considering, to the contrary, that it resulted in rescinding a financial penalty attributable to the 15-day suspension initially imposed on the respondent, I am of the opinion that the adjudicator exceeded her jurisdiction, and, as a result, erred in law by hearing the grievance related to the written reprimand.
B.
Jurisdiction of the adjudicator with respect to the grievance concerning the remedial plan
[31]
On this point, the applicant essentially maintains that the remedial plan submitted by Ms. Gagnon to the respondent on October 3, 2007, was not a disciplinary action and that the plan did not result in the termination, demotion or suspension of the respondent or the imposition of a financial penalty on him. The applicant finds that the plan therefore does not fall within the parameters established in section 209 of the PSLRA.
[32]
The respondent, in his grievance, alleged that the remedial plan is directly linked to the vitiated findings of the complaint investigation report on the basis of which final disciplinary action was imposed on him 29 months earlier. The respondent alleged that the remedial plan constitutes disguised disciplinary action as well as a double penalty that has financial consequences.
[33]
On this point, it is necessary to reproduce the following excerpt from the adjudicator's decision:
[228] The grievor was informed of the firm intention to assign him to other duties at a meeting on May 18, 2005. Ms. Paris and Ms. Gagnon offered him an assignment under the SAPP for two years during which he had to look for a new job, or he would be laid off after 18 months. The grievor was then threatened with an exclusion order that would reassign him permanently if he did not accept a transfer, despite such an order being illegal. Ms. Gagnon reassigned the grievor to Dorval under the threat of being deemed on unauthorized leave if he did not report on the indicated date. Ms. Gagnon offered him the services of a coach but did not agree to the coach's final recommendations. Ms. Gagnon proposed a remedial plan, based on conduct identified during the investigation, which depended entirely on her goodwill. Given the circumstances, I believe that the assignment to duties in Dorval constituted disciplinary action.
[229] Even though the grievor retained his classification, the punitive nature of his reassignment was evident in that he was no longer supervising employees, was performing none of the duties of his substantive position and was isolated from his normal place of work. The duties assigned to him had little value; he often had nothing to do, and he was relegated to a junior officer's office. Maintaining a classification does not give an employer free reign to reassign an employee to demeaning duties against his or her will. In summary, the grievor's assignment to other duties was a demotion even though his classification level remained unchanged. Consequently, it amounted to a second disguised disciplinary action.
[230] A disciplinary demotion is within an adjudicator's jurisdiction.
[34]
The assessment of the facts by the adjudicator in finding a disguised disciplinary action seems completely reasonable. The simple affirmation by the applicant, in his memorandum, that the plan in question [translation] "was to help reinstate the respondent in his substantive position" cannot contradict the adjudicator's serious and detailed analysis, which properly considered all of the circumstances put into evidence.
[35]
Given the reasonableness of the finding of fact that we are in the presence of a disguised disciplinary action, the plan falls within the parameters established in section 209 of the PSLRA and the adjudicator's decision to hear the grievance in this respect is correct.
C.
Harm to the respondent's health
[36]
The applicant is challenging the adjudicator's finding that the respondent suffered harm to his health because of the stress of an unjustified investigation. The applicant attacks the text in paragraph 337 of the adjudicator's decision in particular:
The grievor testified that, due to the length of the proceedings and the stress related to the investigation, he became seriously depressed, and he exhausted his bank of sick leave. His partner left him because of the family stress caused by this matter. At the time of the hearing, the grievor was living in a rooming house. He is ruined. Although medical evidence may be useful in establishing a physical or psychological disorder, it is not necessary to establish the serious and detrimental nature of the employer's conduct or the damage to the grievor's dignity. The grievor was entitled to a workplace free of malice and bad faith, in other words, to a healthy and productive environment, as the employer advocates.
[37]
On that point, the medical evidence the applicant found unsatisfactory was completed by the respondent's clear and direct testimony that he suffered from a major depression between March and September 2005, which the adjudicator was entitled to take into account, as she did.
[38]
In the recent decision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  my colleague Justice Russel W. Zinn specified that only the victim's testimonial evidence can suffice to find that the victim suffered a moral injury such as distress. This weighing of the evidence is left up to the adjudicator. The lack of medical evidence does not deny the damage suffered by the victim as long as the causal link between the moral injury suffered and the wrongful conduct alleged is nevertheless demonstrated.
[39]
Under the circumstances, the adjudicator's finding that the stress of the unjustified investigation caused harm to the respondent's health does not seem unreasonable to me.
[40]
Because this is a question of mixed fact and law, which the applicant himself has also acknowledged, the intervention of the Court on this point is unwarranted.
D.
Reimbursement for the respondent's loss of career advancement opportunities
[41]
Again, this is, as acknowledged by the applicant himself, a question of mixed fact and law that involves the reasonableness standard of review.
[42]
On this point, the applicant submits that the respondent failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he suffered a loss of career advancement opportunities. The applicant also submits that the respondent did not prove the necessary causal link between the harassment investigation and the other circumstances in this matter.
[43]
On this point, it is necessary to reproduce the following excerpts from the adjudicator's decision:
[43] On August 29, 2005, the grievor informed Ms. Gagnon that he would be able to return to work on September 6, 2005. In an August 31, 2005 email, Ms. Gagnon told him that he would serve his 15-day suspension from September 12 to September 30, 2005 and ordered him to report to the Transport Canada offices in Dorval on September 6, 2005, not to his normal work location in downtown Montreal. If he did not report for work in Dorval, he would be deemed absent without authorization. The grievor was to occupy a position in Security and Emergency Preparedness in the aviation and marine section and eventually in the passenger rail development section. The grievor reported to Dorval on September 6, 2005 as ordered. He was given a negligible, if not non-existent, workload. He worked in an open office, directly opposite a shredder, a printer and a fax machine.
[51] The grievor met with the coach on January 18, 2007 to agree on the coaching approach. His next meeting with the coach was on May 29, 2007. After several meetings, the coaching ended. As part of the coaching, the coach recommended that the grievor have the opportunity to supervise employees, a recommendation that Ms. Gagnon rejected.
[52] On August 27, 2007, the grievor met with Mr. Lapointe, the new director general. Mr. Lapointe informed him that, since it had been found that the grievor had committed harassment over several years, he would not be reinstated in a managerial position in the near future and that his manager would soon meet with him to provide him with a remedial plan.
[54] On October 3, 2007, Ms. Gagnon met with the grievor to give him a document entitled "[translation] Remedial Plan for Reinstatement," along with an explanatory letter indicating that the grievor might eventually be reinstated in his managerial position under certain conditions, including that he acknowledge the wrongdoing identified in the investigation report. On October 17, 2007, the grievor rejected the proposed remedial plan, claiming that the employer was trying, by devious means, to prevent him from going forward with the adjudication of his grievances. On October 24, 2007, he filed a fourth individual grievance (PSLRB File No. 566-02-1777), objecting to the imposition of the remedial plan and to his reassignment and also claiming damages.
[44]
The assessment of these facts by the adjudicator is not unreasonable. The adjudicator's decision appears justified and transparent and her process appears intelligible (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47). The applicant is simply seeking to minimize the adverse effects of the investigation at issue on the career and reputation of the respondent, a manager unjustly accused of sexual harassment.
[45]
Therefore, being of the opinion that the adjudicator, under the circumstances, was correct in determining that there was a loss of career advancement opportunities for the respondent, was that same adjudicator entitled to order, as she did, the financial assessment of that loss by and at the expense of the party held responsible for that loss?
[46]
In my view, this action is authorized under subsection 228(2) of the Act. Because it was reasonable for her to find that the respondent had suffered a loss of career advancement opportunities because of his employer's wrong, it is clear that the adjudicator was entitled to order it to pay damages to the employee. The authority to award relief "that he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances", pursuant to subsection 228(2) of the Act, is very broad. By asking the deputy head to carry out, at the deputy head's expense, a financial assessment of the loss suffered by the respondent by a human resources specialist seems not only in compliance with the Act, but also very reasonable. By letting the employer choose the expert, the adjudicator sought to ensure a fair and non-excessive assessment.

Reimbursement of counsel fees
[47]
This is a question of law requiring the application of the correctness standard of review, as emphasized by Justice Zinn in
Tipple
, above, at paragraph 35:
Notwithstanding that these two considerations point to a reasonableness standard, the final factor in the standard of review analysis, the expertise of the decision maker, points to a correctness standard of review given that, as suggested by Mr. Tipple, the Adjudicator was not relying on his expertise in labour law but rather was applying an appellate-court decision regarding the jurisdiction of human rights tribunals to award costs. Accordingly, I agree with the parties that when one conducts the required standard of review analysis it indicates that correctness is the appropriate standard for dealing with the Board's jurisdiction to award costs.
[48]
The applicant argues that the adjudicator is a member of a statutory tribunal, deriving its powers from the Act alone, which does not give adjudicators the authority to award legal fees to successful aggrieved public servants. The applicant submits that the adjudicator indirectly ordered the deputy head to reimburse the respondent for his counsel fees. In that respect, the applicant raises
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which the Federal Court of Appeal considered that "[t] here is no inherent jurisdiction in a court, nor in any other statutory body, to award costs . . . it can only have jurisdiction to award costs if such jurisdiction is expressly given to it either by the Code or some other act" (paragraph 80). Justice Layden-Stevenson, at paragraph 91, specified that it is "settled law that nothing less than express authority will suffice" and that the issue of such implied jurisdiction would be unusual. She also mentioned, at paragraph 93, that such implied authority "can only be implied where 'that power is actually necessary for the administration of the terms of the legislation; coherence, logicality, or desirability are not sufficient'". (It should be noted that this decision was appealed before the Supreme Court of Canada, which has not yet rendered a decision.)
[49]
Tipple
, above, at paragraph 91, also notes that decisions by other tribunals regarding their authority to award costs do not pertain to the PSLRB because the authority derives exclusively from each tribunal's enabling statute.
Tipple
also specifies that, even though adjudicators have broad discretion in making their orders pursuant to section 228 of the Act, they have no authority under the Act to award costs (at paragraph 94). Finally, Justice Zinn added, at paragraph 99, that a PSLRB adjudicator cannot order a party to pay costs or order the payment of an amount equivalent to those fees or expenses.
[50]
In this case, the following excerpts from the adjudicator's decision clearly demonstrate that the adjudicator erred in law by trying to indirectly do something she was not entitled to do directly, that is, to award legal costs to the respondent:
[336] Since he was excluded from the bargaining unit,
the grievor incurred costs to defend himself
. I am convinced that
the complexity of this matter warranted the grievor obtaining professional advice and representation by counsel
. I consider the employer's slowness in dealing with the complaint and the consequences of the investigation to be aggravating factors. The grievor sold his home (at a loss), his motorcycle and a second car
to cover his legal fees and expenses
. He also cashed in his RRSP. I believe that the employer's failings justify the grievor being compensated for those losses. In this instance, the employer contributed largely to the lengthiness of the proceedings by its handling of the complaint, the investigation, the grievance process and the adjudication.
[353] With respect to the loss of personal property incurred by the grievor
to pay fees and expenses to his counsel
, I order that an actuarial assessment of the loss incurred be carried out, at the deputy head's expense, and I order the deputy head to reimburse the grievor the actuarial value of that loss.
[Emphasis added.]
F.
Punitive damages
[51]
It is undisputed by the parties that the adjudicator had the authority, in accordance with section 228 of the Act, to order the payment of punitive damages. The issue is whether the adjudicator, in this case, was right to award them.
[52]
The applicant reiterates jurisprudence cited by the adjudicator that it is only when the impugned act constitutes in itself an independent actionable wrong that punitive damages may be awarded (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> it is indicated that a duty of good faith and fair dealing does not constitute an independent wrong giving rise to punitive damages. However, in my view, the Federal Court of Appeal does not go as far as saying that bad faith by an employer can never constitute an independent civil wrong. In my opinion, it is fairer to say that the decision teaches us that evidence of bad faith does not necessarily constitute an independent wrong giving rise to punitive damages.
[53]
In this case, the adjudicator properly weighed the principles applicable to the matter:
[344] The concept of punitive damages is well documented in common law. The conduct must be harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious. However, there is no specific test for determining what constitutes malice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para 62, the Supreme Court stated that damages are restricted to "... advertent wrongful acts that are so malicious and outrageous that they are deserving of punishment on their own." Thus, punitive damages are awarded in the case of a wrongful act that, on its own, gives recourse to legal action. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court cautioned that the discretion to award such damages should be exercised most cautiously and only in exceptional cases. I am also conscious of the fact that the Federal Court of Appeal refused to award such damages in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Subsequently, the adjudicator did indeed find that she was in the presence of the independent wrong required to award punitive damages to the respondent, which she did:
[346] After reviewing the submitted case law, particularly <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I find that the facts in this case establish that the employer's representatives acted deliberately and with malice toward the grievor in the following actions:
- launching an investigation without verifying the facts and without explaining to the grievor why the investigation included incidents that were (a) not part of the original complaint (16 incidents, when the complaint contained 5); (b) excluded from the definition set out in the
policy
(such as abuse of authority); (c) untimely under the
policy
(that is, occurring more than one year before the complaint was filed); (d) clearly excluded from the investigative authority (sexual assault); and (e) occurring before the
policy
came into force (incidents occurring before June 1, 2001);
- not informing the grievor of the key elements of the complaint until just a few days before the start of the investigation and not informing him of Ms. Belliveau's complaint or of the document containing a chronology of events prepared by Ms. Deslauriers in support of her allegations;
- favouring Ms. Deslauriers by meeting with her union representative before she filed a formal complaint; by meeting with Ms. Deslauriers and her union representative in September 2004 to agree to investigate allegations of sexual assault; by meeting with Ms. Deslauriers on three occasions to help her prepare a complaint that met the investigator's expectations; and by asking the investigators to interview Ms. Belliveau on the ground that her statement could support Ms. Deslauriers' allegations, despite the employer dismissing Ms. Belliveau's complaint;
- deciding to conduct an investigation of the entire "organizational climate" of the section managed by the grievor, without informing him accordingly and without allowing him to offer explanations;
- considering the grievor guilty of acts of harassment without fully reviewing the case;
- trying to persuade the grievor to accept a demotion by threatening him with an exclusion order that the employer knew was illegal, and then, when the grievor refused to be intimidated, by removing him from his managerial duties and assigning him to demeaning tasks;
- retaining in the grievor's personnel record an outdated disciplinary action and using it to impose a "remedial plan" on the grievor, the success of which depended entirely on Ms. Gagnon's goodwill, all without explaining to the grievor the deficiencies that he was alleged to have shown;
- reassigning the grievor to a work location more than two hours' travelling time from his home, with the threat of disciplinary action if he did not report to work and without consulting him or attempting to mitigate the effects on his personal life; and
- trying to extinguish the grievor's right to adjudication by replacing a 15-day suspension with a letter of reprimand.
I believe that all these acts were intended to harm the grievor, that they were not simply the consequence of an investigation or discipline, and that they constitute malicious conduct in and of themselves. The employer did not provide me with any reasonable explanation for its actions. The unjustified disciplinary actions, specifically the reassignment to duties not involving managerial responsibilities, unduly harmed the grievor's advancement when, until the complaint was filed, he had had superior performance evaluations, was appreciated by his superiors and had a clean disciplinary record. Therefore, in light of these circumstances, I find that the grievor is entitled to financial relief to compensate him fully for all his losses arising from what I deem malice by the employer.
. . .
[354] With respect to the wrongful acts by the deputy head, namely, malicious, reprehensible and harmful conduct toward the grievor, I order the deputy head to pay the grievor the amount of $50 000 in punitive damages.
[54]
It has not been established that the assessment of the facts indicated in the above-mentioned excerpts from the adjudicator's decision was unreasonable. In that respect, the decision is supported by important evidence in the record, namely the testimony by Ms. Brouillette, Ms. Pageot, Ms. Paris and Ms. Gagnon and that of the respondent, testimony that resulted in the adjudicator stating the following:
[339] The hearing of this case has convinced me that Mses. Brouillette, Pageot, Paris and Gagnon did not act by omission or ignorance with respect to either the investigation or the sanctions imposed on the grievor. All four testified to having received expert advice, and even advice from the DND, before making their decisions. The deficiencies found in that decision making are inexcusable. The grievor was destroyed personally and professionally because of their actions.
[340] In short, the employer failed in its duty of diligence, prudence and impartiality. The employer's efforts to crack the grievor and provoke his departure are unjustifiable. It is particularly disturbing that such actions were taken by senior managers of the employer. The abusive nature of the action taken by the employer and its lack of impartiality with respect to the investigation are blameworthy and unworthy of the responsibilities entrusted to senior management.
The adjudicator also raised several contradictions and inconsistencies in the testimony of the complainant, Ms. Deslauriers, which have not been disputed.
[55]
Under the circumstances, it would be completely inappropriate for this Court to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of a specialized adjudicator that must be given great deference, especially considering the provisions in subsection 233(1) of the Act.
[56]
In light of these facts, the assessment of which ultimately appears reasonable, I am of the opinion that the adjudicator was correct in finding that there was an independent wrong, that is, "malice by the employer", a wrong that resulted in damages to the respondent that the adjudicator believed to have been established in conformity with the above-quoted applicable jurisprudence.
[57]
For all of these reasons and because the adjudicator's decision is well-founded for the most part, it would be inappropriate to reconsider the matter in its entirety. Instead, it is appropriate to allow the application for judicial review and to refer the matter back to the same adjudicator for review and variation of her decision, based strictly on the same evidence already before her, in such as way as to simply make it comply with these reasons. More specifically, the matter is referred back to the same adjudicator for the following purposes:
(1) for her to recognize that she does not have jurisdiction to hear the respondent's grievance related to the written reprimand and to assess the impact of this recognition, if any, on the rest of her decision, and
(2) for her to not directly or indirectly award the respondent compensation for his counsel and legal fees.
[58]
Given the divided success, there is no award of costs.
JUDGMENT
[59]
The application for judicial review is allowed. The matter is referred back to the same adjudicator for review and variation of her decision, based strictly on the same evidence already before her, in such as way as to simply make it comply with the reasons given today in support of this decision. More specifically, the matter is referred back to the same adjudicator for the following purposes:
(1) for her to recognize that she does not have jurisdiction to hear the respondent's grievance related to the written reprimand and to assess the impact of this recognition, if any, on the rest of her decision, and
(2) for her to not directly or indirectly award the respondent compensation for his counsel and legal fees.
[60]
There is no award of costs.

Procureur général du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  décision d'un arbitre de la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique (« CRTFP ») présentée en vertu de l'article 18.1 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-7, par le Procureur général du Canada (le demandeur). L'arbitre a accueilli les quatre griefs déposés par M. Raymond Robitaille (le défendeur).
[2]
Le défendeur est à l'emploi du ministère des Transports depuis 1990. Il occupe le poste de gestionnaire, Exploitation et matériel roulant ferroviaire pour la direction « Surface de la région du Québec », classifié au niveau TI-08.
[3]
Le 16 avril 2004, Mme Colette Deslauriers a déposé une plainte de harcèlement contre le défendeur dont elle était la subalterne. Le défendeur fut avisé de cette plainte par lettre datée du 6 juillet 2004. Le nom de l'enquêtrice lui a été communiqué ainsi qu'à Mme Deslauriers le 13 août 2004.
[4]
Le 26 novembre 2004, Mme Deslauriers a acheminé à la directrice des ressources humaines un document dans lequel elle a inclus onze nouvelles allégations de harcèlement contre le défendeur. Le 22 décembre, la directrice et Mme Deslauriers ont travaillé ensemble à l'élaboration d'un nouveau document contenant les nouvelles allégations. Le défendeur a reçu ce document le 3 janvier 2005 et l'enquête a débuté le 4 janvier 2005.
[5]
Mme Deslauriers a été rencontrée par les enquêteurs le 10 janvier 2005. Ceux-ci ont ensuite rencontré 11 autres témoins avant de voir le défendeur le 24 janvier 2005. Ce dernier leur a remis un cartable contenant plusieurs documents visant à réfuter les allégations de Mme Deslauriers. Par souci d'économie, les enquêteurs n'ont pas enregistré les portions du témoignage du défendeur en rapport avec des extraits du cartable, lequel n'a pas été remis à l'employeur avec le rapport d'enquête.
[6]
Le 21 février 2005, Mme Hélène Gagnon, la supérieure hiérarchique du défendeur, lui a ordonné, par courriel, de ne plus se présenter au bureau et de travailler à distance. Au début de mars 2005, le défendeur a reçu une copie du rapport préliminaire. Il a envoyé sa réplique écrite le 20 mars 2005 et considère que celle-ci a été ignorée par les enquêteurs. Le 16 mars 2005, le Dr Yves Faucher avait mis le défendeur en arrêt de travail pour une période indéterminée à cause de stress et dépression alléguée par le défendeur. Le demandeur prétend qu'aucun motif ne figurait dans le rapport du Dr Faucher.
[7]
Le 26 avril 2005, le défendeur a reçu une copie du rapport d'enquête qui soutenait que dix des faits présentés, sur un total de seize, correspondaient à la définition du harcèlement. Le 5 mai 2005, le défendeur a demandé à la directrice des ressources humaines quels étaient ses recours à l'encontre du rapport. Sa demande est demeurée sans réponse. Le 18 mai 2005, la gestion a rencontré le défendeur afin de l'informer qu'il ne serait pas réintégré à son poste de gestionnaire au retour de son congé de maladie, ni à aucun autre poste exigeant des responsabilités de gestion.
[8]
Le 29 mai 2005, le défendeur a déposé son premier grief, contestant l'iniquité de la procédure d'enquête et la décision de ne pas le réintégrer à son poste. Le 7 juin 2005, Mme Gagnon a imposé au défendeur une deuxième mesure disciplinaire, soit une suspension de 15 jours sans rémunération. Le 22 juin 2005, le défendeur a déposé son deuxième grief à l'encontre de cette suspension. Mme Gagnon a rejeté les griefs au premier palier de la procédure. Les griefs ont subséquemment été rejetés au deuxième palier.
[9]
Le 6 septembre 2005, à son retour de congé de maladie, le défendeur a dû se présenter à Dorval au sein du groupe « Sûreté des transports et préparatifs d'urgence » pour y travailler. Le poste à Dorval n'exigeait aucune responsabilité de gestion, le défendeur n'ayant que peu de tâches à accomplir. De plus, ce poste était classifié de simple niveau TI-06, bien que le salaire du défendeur et son niveau de classification étaient demeuré inchangés. La suspension de 15 jours a eu lieu du 12 septembre au 30 septembre inclusivement.
[10]
Le 4 octobre 2005, la directrice régionale des ressources humaines a remis au défendeur une offre d'emploi déterminée pour deux ans sous le Programme de rémunération d'affectation spéciale (« PRAS »). La directrice a informé le défendeur que s'il n'acceptait pas cette offre, il serait muté sans son consentement dans un poste inférieur au sien. Le 9 novembre 2005, Mme Nicole Pageot, la directrice générale régionale de Transports Canada, a tenté d'obtenir un décret d'exclusion permettant une mutation sans consentement du défendeur. Toutefois, un tel décret n'était pas permis. Dès janvier 2006, le bureau du défendeur à Montréal a été vidé, bien qu'il était toujours titulaire de son poste d'attache.
[11]
Le troisième palier de la procédure des griefs a eu lieu le 17 mars 2006. Le 20 juin 2006, n'ayant pas reçu de réponse, le défendeur a renvoyé ses deux griefs à la CRTFP pour arbitrage. La décision au troisième palier aurait dû être rendue au plus tard le 2 juin 2006. Cependant, celle-ci a été finalement rendue le 6 juillet 2006 et n'a été reçue par le défendeur que le 17 juillet 2006. Dans cette décision, l'employeur réduit la suspension de 15 jours à une réprimande écrite, mais maintient le transfert au bureau de Dorval. Le 23 août 2006, le défendeur formule donc un troisième grief concernant cette réprimande écrite.
[12]
Le 29 novembre 2006, Mme Gagnon a rencontré le défendeur pour lui parler d'un retour à son poste s'il acceptait de corriger son comportement décrit dans le rapport d'enquête. Le défendeur contestant toujours les allégations de ce rapport, le troisième grief fut envoyé en arbitrage le 18 décembre 2006.
[13]
À la mi-décembre 2006, Mme Gagnon attribue au défendeur un « coach en gestion ». Les sessions de coaching débutèrent en mai 2007 et furent suivies d'une recommandation que le défendeur reprenne ses tâches de supervision.
[14]
Le 22 juin 2007, le défendeur a déposé une plainte de harcèlement psychologique contre Mme Gagnon. La direction a refusé de faire enquête à ce sujet.
[15]
Le 3 octobre 2007, Mme Gagnon a rencontré le défendeur pour lui remettre un « Plan d'amélioration en vertu d'une réintégration » selon lequel le défendeur pourrait être réintégré à son poste deux ans plus tard. Le 17 octobre 2007, le défendeur a refusé ce plan et, le 24 octobre 2007, il a déposé un quatrième grief à l'encontre de celui-ci.
[16]
Les quatre griefs envoyés à l'arbitrage sont bien résumés dans la décision de l'arbitre aux paragraphes suivants:
[5] Le premier grief (dossier de la CRTFP 566-02-421) conteste le rapport final de l'enquête menée sur les allégations de la plainte. Le fonctionnaire allègue un manque d'équité procédurale, la partialité des enquêteurs, un rapport incomplet et, par conséquent, des conclusions non fondées. Le fonctionnaire demande sa réintégration dans son poste de gestionnaire, le retrait de toute référence à la plainte de son dossier personnel et le remboursement des frais, déboursés et honoraires professionnels engagés pour se défendre.
[6] Le deuxième grief (dossier de la CRTFP 566-02-420) conteste la mesure disciplinaire de 15 jours de suspension à la suite du rapport d'enquête déclarant comme étant fondées les allégations de harcèlement déposées contre le fonctionnaire. Le fonctionnaire demande sa réintégration dans son poste de gestionnaire et le remboursement des pertes pécuniaires, présentes et futures.
[7] Le troisième grief (dossier de la CRTFP 566-02-710) conteste les conclusions d'une lettre de réprimande qui a remplacé la suspension de 15 jours, que le fonctionnaire allègue comme étant une mesure disciplinaire déguisée parce qu'elle reprend et traite d'incidents prescrits et qui ont été écartés par la décision rendue sur le grief portant le numéro 566-02-420 au dernier palier de la procédure applicable aux griefs individuels. Le fonctionnaire demande la cessation des tactiques d'acharnement et de discrimination envers lui suite à l'enquête, une déclaration que l'enquête et ses conclusions sont viciées, le retrait de la réprimande écrite, sa réintégration dans son poste de gestionnaire et le remboursement de toutes les pertes pécuniaires subies.
[8] Le quatrième grief (dossier de la CRTFP 566-02-1777) conteste le plan de redressement du 3 octobre 2007 que l'employeur veut imposer au fonctionnaire comme condition d'une possible réintégration dans son poste de gestionnaire. Le fonctionnaire allègue que le plan de redressement est directement lié aux conclusions viciées du rapport d'enquête concernant la plainte et en vertu duquel le fonctionnaire a déjà reçu une mesure disciplinaire définitive 29 mois plus tôt. Le fonctionnaire allègue qu'il s'agit d'une mesure disciplinaire déguisée et d'une double pénalité qui a des conséquences pécuniaires. Le fonctionnaire demande l'octroi de dommages au montant de 112 000 $, le remboursement de tous les crédits de congé de maladie qu'il a pris depuis avril 2004, sa réintégration dans son poste de gestionnaire, une déclaration que l'enquête est viciée, le retrait de toute référence à la plainte ou de ses séquelles de ses dossiers personnels, le remboursement des frais, déboursés et honoraires professionnels encourus pour se défendre, la remise d'une lettre d'excuse pour les sévices qu'il a subis et des dommages compensatoires, exemplaires et punitifs de l'ordre de 1 895 00 $.
[17]
L'audience concernant les trois premiers griefs a débuté le 8 janvier 2008 devant l'arbitre de grief Michele A. Pineau. L'employeur ne s'est pas objecté au regroupement des griefs. Le quatrième grief a été rajouté le 25 janvier 2008. Les questions soulevées par les griefs ayant été considérées comme étant liées les unes aux autres, les griefs ont donc été finalement réunis pour fin d'audience.
[18]
Dans une décision fort élaborée, l'arbitre a rejeté les objections de l'employeur quant à sa compétence et a accueilli les quatre griefs du défendeur. La décision résume le témoignage de chaque témoin quant aux plaintes de Mme Deslauriers et conclut qu'aucune de celles-ci n'aurait dû être retenue. L'arbitre a en outre soulevé des contradictions et des incohérences dans le témoignage de Mme Deslauriers et a donc plutôt cru le défendeur.
[19]
Ayant reconnu sa compétence et ayant accueilli les griefs, l'arbitre a ordonné les mesures réparatrices suivantes:
[349] À l'égard de l'imposition de mesures disciplinaires injustifiées, dont une rétrogradation, j'ordonne ce qui suit:
- le fonctionnaire est réintégré dans son poste de gestionnaire - Exploitation et matériel roulant ferroviaire au centre-ville de Montréal, rétroactivement au 6 septembre 2005, et ce sans pénalité ou autre conséquence;
- toutes les mesures faisant l'objet des griefs sont annulées, comme si elles n'avaient jamais existées;
- l'administrateur général doit retirer toute mention de la plainte de Mme Deslauriers et de l'enquête du dossier personnel du fonctionnaire ainsi que de tout autre dossier le concernant;
- l'administrateur général doit indemniser le fonctionnaire pour toute perte de temps supplémentaire, depuis le 6 septembre 2005, par une somme calculée sur la moyenne du temps supplémentaire des trois années qui ont précédé sa réaffectation à Dorval.
[350] En ce qui concerne l'atteinte à la santé du fonctionnaire causée par le stress d'une enquête injustifiée, j'ordonne à l'administrateur général de rembourser les crédits dans la banque de congés de maladie pris par le fonctionnaire entre le 16 mars et le 6 septembre 2005.
[351] En ce qui concerne les pertes encourues pour le temps de déplacement journalier et les dépenses de transport, j'ordonne à l'administrateur général de payer au fonctionnaire ce qui suit:
- les frais de kilométrage du fonctionnaire entre le domicile du fonctionnaire et son bureau à Dorval depuis le 6 septembre 2005;
- le temps de déplacement, jusqu'à deux heures par jour, pour chaque journée travaillée à Dorval depuis le 6 septembre 2005.
[352] En ce qui concerne la carrière du fonctionnaire, j'ordonne à l'administrateur général de faire faire, à ses frais, une évaluation monétaire de la perte de perspective d'avancement de carrière du fonctionnaire, depuis le 6 septembre 2005 par un spécialiste en ressources humaines et de rembourser au fonctionnaire toute perte de salaire et de bénéfices, y compris la pension, qui en a résulté.
[353] En ce qui concerne la perte de biens personnels encourue par le fonctionnaire afin de payer les honoraires et frais de son procureur, j'ordonne que soit faite une évaluation actuarielle, aux frais de l'administrateur général, de la perte encourue, et j'ordonne à l'administrateur général de rembourser au fonctionnaire la valeur actuarielle de cette perte.
[354] En ce qui concerne les actes fautifs de l'administrateur général, soit avoir eu un comportement malveillant, répréhensible et malicieux à l'endroit du fonctionnaire, j'ordonne à l'administrateur général de payer au fonctionnaire la somme de 50 000 $ à titre de dommages punitifs.
[355] Je demeure saisie de cette affaire pour une période de 90 jours suivant l'émission de cette décision pour trancher tout désaccord entre les parties, y compris le choix d'un spécialiste en ressources humaines, d'un actuaire, des valeurs actuarielles et du calcul des montants ordonnés.

[21]
L'argumentation du demandeur soulève les questions en litige suivantes:
a. L'arbitre a-t-elle outrepassé sa compétence en se saisissant du grief portant sur une réprimande écrite?
b. L'arbitre a-t-elle outrepassé sa compétence en se saisissant du grief portant sur le plan de redressement?
c. L'arbitre a-t-elle erré en concluant que le défendeur a subi une atteinte à sa santé causée par le stress d'une enquête injustifiée?
d. L'arbitre a-t-elle erré en ordonnant à l'administrateur général de faire faire, à ses frais, une évaluation monétaire de la perte de perspective d'avancement de carrière du défendeur et de lui rembourser toute perte de salaire et de bénéfices, y compris la pension, qui en a résulté?
e. L'arbitre a-t-elle erré en droit en ordonnant à l'administrateur général de faire, à ses frais, une évaluation actuarielle de la perte des biens personnels encourue par le défendeur pour payer les honoraires et frais de son procureur et de lui rembourser la valeur actuarielle de cette perte?
f. L'arbitre a-t-elle erré en ordonnant à l'administrateur général de payer au défendeur la somme de 50 000 $ à titre de dommages punitifs?
[22]
La norme de contrôle applicable à une question de droit ou d'excès de compétence d'un arbitre sous la LRTFP est celle de la décision correcte (
Canada (Procureur général) c. Frazee
, 2007 CF 1176 aux para 14-15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para 11 et suivants et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La Cour doit donc décider de « l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au para 47).
I.
Analyse
A. Compétence de l'arbitre à l'encontre du grief portant sur la réprimande écrite
[24]
La preuve révèle qu'en date du 6 juillet 2006, l'employeur a réduit la mesure disciplinaire de 15 jours de suspension sans rémunération à une réprimande écrite, et que cette décision a été confirmée par Mme Gagnon dans une lettre adressée au défendeur en date du 13 juillet 2006. C'est par la suite, le 24 août 2006, que le défendeur a déposé son grief contre cette réprimande écrite.
[25]
L'article 208 de la LRTFP permet à un fonctionnaire s'estimant lésé de présenter un grief à l'égard de toute question portant sur ses conditions de travail.
[26]
Je suis d'accord avec le demandeur que tout grief présenté en vertu de l'article 208 de la LRTFP n'est pas nécessairement arbitrable. Le Parlement a précisé à l'article 209 de la LRTFP que seulement les griefs portant sur des matières aux alinéas 209(1)
a
),
b
),
c
) et
d
) peuvent être renvoyés à l'arbitrage.
[27]
Plus spécifiquement, en ce qui a trait aux mesures disciplinaires, le Parlement a décidé que seulement les griefs contestant les mesures disciplinaires les plus sévères peuvent être renvoyés à l'arbitrage. Selon l'alinéa 209(1)
b
) de la LRTFP, seul un grief contre une mesure disciplinaire entraînant un licenciement, une rétrogradation, une suspension ou une sanction pécuniaire peut être renvoyé à l'arbitrage.
[28]
Une réprimande écrite, quoiqu'une mesure disciplinaire, n'entraîne pas les conséquences énumérées à l'alinéa 209(1)
b
) de la LRTFP et par conséquent, un grief portant sur une réprimande écrite ne peut être renvoyé à l'arbitrage. La Cour fédérale a confirmé cette interprétation dans
Canada (Procureur général) c. Lachapelle
, [1978] A.C.F. no 145, au paragraphe 11:
. . . En édictant ce texte, le Parlement entendait manifestement limiter et préciser les cas où un employé, syndiqué ou non, aurait droit de soumettre son grief à ce mode d'arbitrage qu'il établissait d'autorité et dont il confiait la surveillance à cette commission qu'il venait de créer. Il est clair que pour lui tous les cas de griefs n'exigent pas l'intervention d'un arbitre officiel par-delà les paliers de la procédure ordinaire. [...] En s'exprimant comme il l'a fait, le Parlement me semble avoir voulu envisager globalement tous les griefs ayant trait à des mesures disciplinaires imposées à des individus pour ne retenir que ceux relatifs à des mesures ayant entraîné le congédiement, la suspension ou une peine pécuniaire.
[29]
Cette interprétation a été également adoptée par la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  façon précise les griefs qui peuvent faire l'objet d'un renvoi à l'arbitrage. Seule la mesure disciplinaire qui dans l'immédiat a entraîné une suspension, une peine pécuniaire, un licenciement ou une rétrogradation peut être renvoyée à l'arbitrage.
[8] La lettre de réprimande ne constitue pas une sanction qui donne droit au renvoi à l'arbitrage même si de fait il s'agit d'une mesure disciplinaire qui, dans le cadre d'un système de discipline progressive, pourrait un jour justifier l'imposition de sanctions plus sévères.
[30]
Considérant que la lettre de réprimande en question n'a pas eu pour effet d'entraîner le licenciement, la rétrogradation, la suspension ou une sanction pécuniaire, et considérant, au contraire, qu'elle a eu l'effet de renverser une sanction pécuniaire résultant de la suspension de 15 jours imposée initialement au défendeur, je suis d'avis que l'arbitre a outrepassé sa compétence, et, par ce fait, a erré en droit, en se saisissant du grief portant sur la réprimande écrite.
B. Compétence de l'arbitre à l'encontre du grief portant sur le plan de redressement
[31]
À cet égard, le demandeur soutient essentiellement que le plan de redressement remis par Mme Gagnon au défendeur, le 3 octobre 2007, ne constitue pas une mesure disciplinaire et que le plan n'a pas eu pour effet d'entraîner le licenciement, la rétrogradation, la suspension du défendeur ou de lui imposer une sanction pécuniaire. Le demandeur conclut que le plan ne tombe donc pas dans les paramètres édictés à l'article 209 de la LRTFP.
[32]
Pour sa part, le défendeur, dans son grief, allègue que le plan de redressement est directement lié aux conclusions viciées du rapport d'enquête concernant la plainte et en vertu duquel il a déjà reçu une mesure disciplinaire définitive 29 mois plus tôt. Le défendeur y allègue qu'il s'agit d'une mesure disciplinaire déguisée et d'une double pénalité qui a des conséquences pécuniaires.
[33]
À ce sujet, il importe de reproduire ici ce qu'a exprimé l'arbitre dans sa décision:
[228] L'intention bien arrêtée d'affecter le fonctionnaire à d'autres tâches pour une durée indéterminée a été communiquée au fonctionnaire lorsqu'il a été rencontré le 18 mai 2005. Mme Paris et Mme Gagnon lui ont offert une affectation dans le cadre du PRAS pour deux ans et il devait se chercher un nouvel emploi pendant cette période, faute de quoi il serait mis en disponibilité après 18 mois. Ensuite, le fonctionnaire a été menacé d'un décret d'exemption qui l'aurait réaffecté de façon permanente s'il n'acceptait pas une mutation, alors que cette mesure était illégale. Mme Gagnon a réaffecté le fonctionnaire à Dorval sous la menace d'être considéré en congé non autorisé s'il ne se présentait pas à la date indiquée. Mme Gagnon lui a offert les services d'une « coach », mais n'a pas consenti aux dernières recommandations de la « coach ». Mme Gagnon a proposé un plan de redressement, fondé sur des comportements relevés par l'enquête, qui dépendait entièrement de sa bonne volonté. Eu égard à ces circonstances, je suis d'avis que l'assignation à des tâches à Dorval était une mesure disciplinaire.
[229] Même si le fonctionnaire maintenait sa classification, l'aspect punitif de sa réaffectation se dégageait du fait que le fonctionnaire ne supervisait plus d'employés; il n'accomplissait aucune activité de son poste d'attache; il était isolé de son lieu habituel de travail; les tâches qui lui étaient assignées avaient peu de valeur; il était souvent à rien faire; il était relégué à un bureau de subalterne. Le maintien de la classification ne donne pas libre cours à un employeur de réaffecter un fonctionnaire contre son gré à des tâches dévalorisantes. Somme toute, la réaffectation du fonctionnaire à d'autres tâches était une rétrogradation même si son niveau de classification a été maintenu et, par conséquent, elle équivalait à une deuxième mesure disciplinaire déguisée.
[230] Une rétrogradation disciplinaire relève de la compétence d'un arbitre de grief.
[34]
L'appréciation des faits faite par l'arbitre pour conclure à une mesure disciplinaire déguisée m'apparaît tout à fait raisonnable. La simple affirmation par le demandeur, dans son mémoire, que le plan en question « avait pour objectif d'aider le défendeur de réintégrer son poste substantif » ne saurait contredire l'analyse sérieuse et détaillée faite par l'arbitre qui a bien tenu compte de toutes les circonstances mises en preuve.
[35]
Vu la raisonnabilité de la conclusion de fait voulant que nous soyons en présence d'une mesure disciplinaire déguisée, le plan tombe dans les paramètres édictés à l'article 209 de la LRTFP et la décision de l'arbitre de se saisir du grief à cet égard est une décision correcte.
C. Atteinte à la santé du défendeur
[36]
Le demandeur conteste la conclusion de l'arbitre à l'effet que le défendeur a subi une atteinte à sa santé causée par le stress d'une enquête injustifiée. Le demandeur s'en prend particulièrement au texte contenu au paragraphe 337 de la décision de l'arbitre:
Le fonctionnaire a témoigné que la longueur des procédures et le stress relié à l'enquête a fait en sorte qu'il a fait une dépression majeure au point d'épuiser sa banque de congés de maladie. Sa conjointe l'a quitté en raison du stress familial causé par toute cette affaire. Au moment de l'audience, le fonctionnaire habitait dans une pension. Il est ruiné. Bien qu'une preuve médicale puisse s'avérer utile pour démontrer une atteinte physique ou psychologique, elle n'est pas essentielle pour démontrer le caractère grave et nocif de conduite de l'employeur, ni l'atteinte à la dignité du fonctionnaire. Le fonctionnaire avait droit à un milieu de travail exempt de malice et de mauvaise foi, soit un milieu sain et productif comme l'a préconisé l'employeur.
[37]
À ce sujet, la preuve médicale que le demandeur juge insatisfaisante est complétée par le témoignage clair et direct du défendeur à l'effet qu'il souffrait d'une dépression majeure entre mars et septembre 2005, ce dont l'arbitre pouvait, comme elle l'a fait, tenir compte.
[38]
Dans la décision récente
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  mon collègue le juge Russel W. Zinn précise que seule la preuve testimoniale de la victime peut suffire pour conclure que la victime a subi un préjudice moral, telle une détresse. Cette appréciation de la preuve est laissée à l'arbitre. L'absence de preuve médicale ne nie pas le dommage souffert par la victime, en autant que le lien de causalité entre le préjudice moral subi et le comportement fautif reproché est néanmoins démontré.
[39]
Dans les circonstances, la conclusion de l'arbitre voulant que le stress de l'enquête injustifiée ait porté atteinte à la santé du défendeur ne me semble pas déraisonnable.
[40]
S'agissant ici d'une question mixte de fait et de droit, ce que reconnaît d'ailleurs le demandeur lui-même, l'intervention de la Cour sur cette question n'est pas justifiée.
D. Remboursement pour la perte de perspective d'avancement de carrière du défendeur
[41]
Il s'agit encore ici, comme le reconnaît toujours le demandeur lui-même, d'une question mixte de fait et de droit qui implique la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable.
[42]
À ce sujet, le demandeur soumet que le défendeur n'a pas prouvé sur la balance des probabilités avoir subi une perte de perspective d'avancement de carrière. Le demandeur soumet en outre que le défendeur n'a pas prouvé le lien de causalité nécessaire entre l'enquête de harcèlement et les autres circonstances de la présente affaire.
[43]
À ce sujet, il importe de reproduire les extraits suivants de la décision de l'arbitre:
[43] Le 29 août 2005, le fonctionnaire informe Mme Gagnon qu'il est apte à revenir au travail le 6 septembre 2005. Par courriel daté du 31 août 2005, Mme Gagnon lui répond qu'il servira ses 15 jours de suspension du 12 au 30 septembre 2005, et lui ordonne de se présenter aux bureaux de Transports Canada à Dorval le 6 septembre 2005, plutôt qu'à son lieu de travail habituel au centre-ville de Montréal, sous peine d'être considéré en absence non autorisée. Le fonctionnaire doit occuper un poste à la Direction sûreté et préparatifs d'urgence dans la section de l'aviation et du transport maritime et éventuellement le développement du transport ferroviaire des passagers. Le fonctionnaire se présente à Dorval le 6 septembre 2005 tel qu'ordonné. La charge de travail assignée au fonctionnaire est minime, pour ne pas dire inexistante. Il occupe un bureau à aire ouverte, directement en face du déchiqueteur, d'une imprimante et du télécopieur.
[51] Le fonctionnaire rencontre la « coach » le 18 janvier 2007 en vue de s'entendre sur les modalités du coaching. Sa prochaine rencontre avec la « coach » a lieu le 29 mai 2007. Après quelques rencontres, le coaching se termine. Comme partie du coaching, la « coach » recommande que le fonctionnaire ait l'occasion de superviser des employés, ce que refuse Mme Gagnon.
[52] Le 27 août 2007, le fonctionnaire rencontre M. Lapointe, le nouveau directeur général. M. Lapointe lui dit que, puisqu'il a été conclu que le fonctionnaire a commis du harcèlement pendant plusieurs années, il ne sera pas réintégré dans un poste de gestionnaire dans un avenir rapproché et sa gestionnaire le rencontrera prochainement pour lui présenter un plan de redressement.
[54] Le 3 octobre 2007, Mme Gagnon rencontre le fonctionnaire pour lui remettre un document intitulé « Plan d'amélioration en vertu d'une réintégration », accompagné d'une lettre explicative, qui prévoit que le fonctionnaire pourrait éventuellement réintégrer son poste de gestionnaire, à certaines conditions, dont le fait que le fonctionnaire reconnaisse les torts relevés dans le rapport d'enquête. Le 17 octobre 2007, le fonctionnaire refuse le plan de redressement proposé au motif que l'employeur tente par des moyens détournés de l'empêcher d'aller de l'avant avec l'arbitrage de ses griefs. Le 24 octobre 2007, il dépose un quatrième grief individuel (dossier de la CRTFP 566-02-1777) contestant l'imposition d'un plan de redressement et sa réaffectation. Il y réclame aussi des dommages.
[44]
L'appréciation de ces faits, par l'arbitre, n'est pas déraisonnable. La décision de l'arbitre m'apparaît justifiée, transparente et son processus, intelligible (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au para 47). Le demandeur cherche simplement à minimiser les effets néfastes de l'enquête en cause sur la carrière et la réputation du défendeur, un gestionnaire pourtant injustement accusé de harcèlement sexuel.
[45]
Étant donc d'avis que l'arbitre a eu raison, dans les circonstances, de conclure à une perte de perspective d'avancement de carrière du défendeur, le même arbitre pouvait-elle ordonner comme elle l'a fait l'évaluation monétaire de cette perte par et aux frais de la partie tenue responsable de la perte?
[46]
À mon avis, cette façon d'agir est autorisée par le paragraphe 228(2) de la Loi. Ayant raisonnablement conclu que le défendeur avait subi une perte de perspective d'avancement de carrière en raison de la faute de son employeur, il est clair que l'arbitre pouvait ordonner à ce dernier de verser des dommages à l'employé. Le pouvoir d'accorder des mesures réparatrices « qu'il juge indiquées », en vertu du paragraphe 228(2) de la Loi, est très large. En demandant à l'administrateur général de faire, à ses frais, une évaluation monétaire de la perte subie par le défendeur par un spécialiste en ressources humaines m'apparaît non seulement conforme à la Loi, mais aussi fort raisonnable. En laissant l'employeur choisir l'expert, l'arbitre a voulu s'assurer d'une évaluation juste et non excessive.
E. Remboursement pour les frais du procureur
[47]
Il s'agit ici d'une question de droit qui requiert l'application de la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte, comme le souligne le juge Zinn dans
Tipple
, ci-dessus, au paragraphe 35:
Notwithstanding that these two considerations point to a reasonableness standard, the final factor in the standard of review analysis, the expertise of the decision maker, points to a correctness standard of review given that, as suggested by Mr. Tipple, the Adjudicator was not relying on his expertise in labour law but rather was applying an appellate-court decision regarding the jurisdiction of human rights tribunals to award costs. Accordingly, I agree with the parties that when one conducts the required standard of review analysis it indicates that correctness is the appropriate standard for dealing with the Board's jurisdiction to award costs.
[48]
Le demandeur soutient que l'arbitre fait partie d'un tribunal statutaire, tirant ses pouvoirs uniquement de la Loi et que celle-ci ne donne pas à un arbitre de grief le pouvoir d'adjuger des frais juridiques au fonctionnaire lésé qui obtient gain de cause. Le demandeur soumet que l'arbitre a ordonné indirectement à l'administrateur général de rembourser au défendeur les frais de son procureur. À cet égard, le demandeur invoque l'arrêt
Canada (Procureur général) c. Mowat
, 2009 CAF 309, [2010] 4 R.C.F. 579, où la Cour d'appel fédérale a considéré qu'« [a] ucun tribunal, ni organisme constitué en vertu d'une loi n'a compétence inhérente pour accorder des dépens [...], la Commission se voit conférer le pouvoir d'accorder des dépens seulement s'il y a dans le Code ou dans toute autre loi une disposition le prévoyant expressément » (para 80). La juge Layden-Stevenson au paragraphe 91 précise qu'il est « bien établi en droit que ce pouvoir doit être expressément prévu » et que la question d'une telle compétence implicite serait peu commune. Elle mentionne aussi au paragraphe 93 qu'un tel pouvoir implicite « ne peut être inféré que dans le cas où « ce pouvoir était vraiment nécessaire à l'application du texte de loi concerné; la cohérence, ainsi que le caractère logique et souhaitable ne suffisent pas » ». (Il importe de noter que cette décision a été portée en appel devant la Cour suprême du Canada qui n'a pas encore rendu de décision.)
[49]
Tipple
, ci-dessus, à son paragraphe 91, note également que les décisions d'autres tribunaux quant à leur pouvoir d'accorder des frais ne sont pas pertinentes dans le cas de la CRTFP, car ce pouvoir est dérivé exclusivement de la loi créatrice de chaque tribunal.
Tipple
précise en outre que bien que l'arbitre dispose d'un large pouvoir discrétionnaire en formulant ses ordonnances selon l'article 228 de la Loi, celui-ci n'a aucun pouvoir selon la Loi d'accorder des frais (au paragraphe 94). Finalement, le juge Zinn ajoute, au paragraphe 99, qu'un arbitre de la CRTFP ne peut pas condamner une partie à payer les frais ni ordonner le paiement d'un montant équivalent à ces frais et honoraires.
[50]
En l'espèce, les extraits suivants de la décision de l'arbitre démontrent clairement qu'elle a erré en droit en tentant de faire indirectement ce qu'elle ne pouvait faire directement, à savoir adjuger des frais juridiques au défendeur:
[336] En tant que personne exclue de l'unité de négociation,
le fonctionnaire a encouru des frais pour se défendre
. J'ai été persuadée que
la complexité de cette affaire justifiait que le fonctionnaire obtienne des conseils professionnels et se fasse représenter par un avocat
. Le manque de célérité de l'employeur à traiter la plainte et les conséquences de l'enquête sont des facteurs que je juge aggravants.
Pour soutenir les honoraires et frais de son avocat
, le fonctionnaire a vendu sa maison à perte, sa moto et une deuxième voiture. Il a aussi encaissé ses REER. J'estime que les manquements de l'employeur justifient que le fonctionnaire soit indemnisé pour ces pertes. Dans la présente affaire, l'employeur a contribué largement à la longueur des procédures, que ce soit dans le traitement de la plainte ou l'enquête, de la procédure de grief et de l'arbitrage.
[353] En ce qui concerne la perte de biens personnels encourue par le fonctionnaire
afin de payer les honoraires et frais de son procureur
, j'ordonne que soit faite une évaluation actuarielle, aux frais de l'administrateur général, de la perte encourue, et j'ordonne à l'administrateur général de rembourser au fonctionnaire la valeur actuarielle de cette perte. [C'est moi qui souligne.]
F. Dommages punitifs
[51]
Il n'est pas contesté par les parties que l'arbitre a le pouvoir, en vertu de l'article 228 de la Loi, d'ordonner le paiement de dommages punitifs. La question est celle de savoir si l'arbitre, en l'espèce, a eu raison d'en accorder.
[52]
D'une part, le demandeur reprend la jurisprudence citée par l'arbitre voulant que ce ne soit que lorsque l'acte reproché constitue en lui-même une faute distincte donnant ouverture à un droit d'action que des dommages punitifs peuvent être accordés (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> il est indiqué qu'une obligation de bonne foi et de traitement équitable ne constitue pas une faute distincte donnant ouverture à des dommages punitifs. Toutefois, à mon avis, la Cour d'appel fédérale ne va pas jusqu'à dire que la mauvaise foi de la part d'un employeur ne peut jamais constituer une faute civile distincte. À mon sens, il est plus juste de dire que l'arrêt enseigne que la preuve de la mauvaise foi ne constitue pas nécessairement une faute distincte donnant ouverture à des dommages punitifs.
[53]
Dans le présent cas, l'arbitre a bien apprécié les principes applicables en la matière:
[344] La notion de dommages punitifs est bien encadrée par la common law. Les comportements doivent être durs, vengeurs, répréhensibles et malicieux. Il n'existe toutefois aucun critère précis pour déterminer ce qui constitue de la malice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ¶62, la Cour suprême du Canada a déclaré que des dommages peuvent être accordés uniquement lorsque « l'acte fautif délibéré est si malveillant et inacceptable qu'il justifie une sanction indépendante ». Ainsi, les dommages punitifs sont accordés dans le cas d'une faute donnant elle-même ouverture à un droit d'action. Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a fait deux mises-en-garde, soit que le pouvoir discrétionnaire devait s'exercer avec une grande prudence et de façon exceptionnelle. Je suis aussi consciente du fait que la Cour d'appel fédérale, dans
Canada (Procureur général) c. Bédirian
, 2007 CAF 221, a refusé d'accorder de tels dommages.
Puis l'arbitre a effectivement jugé être en présence de la faute distincte requise pour octroyer, comme elle l'a fait, des dommages punitifs au défendeur:
[346] Après avoir pris connaissance de la jurisprudence qui m'a été soumise, et en particulier l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , je suis d'avis que les faits de la présente affaire démontrent que les représentants de l'employeur ont agi délibérément et avec malice à l'égard du fonctionnaire en procédant comme suit:
- en faisant mener une enquête sans vérification des faits et sans expliquer au fonctionnaire pourquoi l'enquête portait sur des incidents: a) qui ne faisaient pas partie de la plainte originale (16 incidents alors que la plainte en comptait 5); b) exclus de la définition de sa politique (comme l'abus de pouvoir); c) prescrits par sa politique (c'est-à-dire qui ont eu lieu plus d'un an avant le dépôt de la plainte); d) clairement exclus du pouvoir d'enquête (l'agression sexuelle); et e) qui se sont produits avant que la politique n'entre en vigueur (les incidents qui précèdent le 1er juin 2001);
- en ne communiquant au fonctionnaire les éléments essentiels à la plainte que quelques jours avant la tenue de l'enquête et en ne lui communiquant ni la plainte de Mme Belliveau ni le document chronologique des événements préparé par Mme Deslauriers au soutien de ses allégations;
- en favorisant Mme Deslauriers, soit: en rencontrant le délégué syndical de celle-ci avant qu'elle dépose une plainte formelle; en rencontrant Mme Deslauriers et son délégué syndical en septembre 2004 en vue d'accepter de faire enquête sur des allégations d'agression sexuelle; en rencontrant Mme Deslauriers à trois reprises pour l'aider à formuler une plainte conforme aux attentes des enquêteurs; en demandant aux enquêteurs de rencontrer Mme Belliveau au motif que sa déclaration pourrait soutenir les allégations de Mme Deslauriers, alors que l'employeur avait rejeté la plainte de Mme Belliveau;
- en décidant de mener une enquête concernant l'ensemble du « climat organisationnel » de la section gérée par le fonctionnaire, sans le lui communiquer et sans lui permettre de s'expliquer;
- en jugeant le fonctionnaire coupable d'actes de harcèlement sans évaluer pleinement le dossier;
- en tentant de persuader le fonctionnaire d'accepter une rétrogradation en le menaçant avec un décret d'exemption que l'employeur savait être illégal, puis, lorsque le fonctionnaire a refusé d'être intimidé, en le relevant de ses fonctions de gestionnaire et en l'affectant à des tâches dévalorisantes;
- en continuant de maintenir dans le dossier personnel du fonctionnaire une mesure disciplinaire devenue désuète, et de s'en servir pour imposer au fonctionnaire un « plan de redressement » dont le succès dépendait entièrement de la bonne volonté de Mme Gagnon, le tout sans expliquer au fonctionnaire les lacunes qui lui étaient reprochées;
- en réaffectant le fonctionnaire à un lieu de travail à plus de deux heures de route de son domicile tous les jours, avec la menace d'une mesure disciplinaire s'il ne se présentait pas au travail, et ce, sans le consulter ou tenter d'atténuer les effets sur sa vie personnelle;
- en tentant de soustraire le fonctionnaire de son droit à l'arbitrage par le renversement d'une suspension de 15 jours en une lettre de réprimande.
J'estime que tous ces gestes étaient destinés à nuire au fonctionnaire et n'étaient pas la simple conséquence de l'enquête ou de la discipline et qu'ils constituent un comportement malveillant en soi. L'employeur ne m'a fourni aucune explication raisonnable pour avoir procédé de la sorte. Les mesures disciplinaires injustifiées, dont la réaffectation à des fonctions ne comportant pas de gestion, ont nui indûment à l'avancement du fonctionnaire qui, jusqu'au moment du dépôt de la plainte, avait des évaluations de rendement supérieures, était apprécié de ses supérieurs et avait un dossier disciplinaire vierge. Je suis donc d'avis qu'en raison de ces circonstances, le fonctionnaire a droit à des mesures réparatrices monétaires visant à l'indemniser pleinement pour toutes ses pertes dues à ce que je qualifie être la malice de l'employeur.
. . . . .
[354] En ce qui concerne les actes fautifs de l'administrateur général, soit avoir eu un comportement malveillant, répréhensible et malicieux à l'endroit du fonctionnaire, j'ordonne à l'administrateur général de payer au fonctionnaire la somme de 50 000 $ à titre de dommages punitifs.
[54]
Il ne m'a pas été démontré que l'appréciation des faits qu'impliquent les extraits ci-dessus de la décision de l'arbitre est déraisonnable. À cet égard, la décision est supportée par d'importants éléments de preuve au dossier, notamment les témoignages de Mmes Brouillette, Pageot, Paris et Gagnon et celui du défendeur, témoignages qui ont amené l'arbitre à s'exprimer ainsi:
[339] L'audience de la présente affaire m'a persuadée que Mmes Brouillette, Pageot, Paris et Gagnon n'ont pas agi par omission ou par ignorance, que ce soit au niveau de l'enquête ou des sanctions imposées au fonctionnaire. Toutes quatre ont témoigné avoir reçu des conseils spécialisés avant de prendre leurs décisions, voire même les conseils du MDN. Les manquements relevés dans cette décision sont inexcusables. Le fonctionnaire a été démoli sur le plan personnel et professionnel en raison de leurs agissements.
[340] Somme toute, l'employeur a manqué à son devoir de diligence, de prudence et d'impartialité. L'acharnement avec lequel il s'est livré pour faire craquer le fonctionnaire et provoquer son départ est injustifiable. Que ces gestes aient été posés par des hauts gestionnaires de l'employeur est un élément particulièrement aggravant. Le caractère abusif des mesures prises par l'employeur et le manque d'impartialité dans le cadre de l'enquête sont condamnables et indignes des responsabilités qui sont accordées à la haute gestion.
L'arbitre a de plus relevé plusieurs contradictions et incohérences dans le témoignage de la plaignante Mme Deslauriers, ce qui n'est pas contesté.
[55]
Dans les circonstances, il serait tout à fait inapproprié pour cette Cour de substituer sa propre appréciation des faits à celle faite par un arbitre spécialisé qui doit bénéficier d'une grande déférence, compte tenu notamment des dispositions du paragraphe 233(1) de la Loi.
[56]
À la lumière de ces faits, dont l'appréciation m'apparaît en fin de compte raisonnable, je suis d'avis que l'arbitre a correctement conclu à l'existence d'une faute distincte, à savoir « la malice de l'employeur », faute qui a causé au défendeur des dommages que l'arbitre a estimé avoir été établis, le tout en conformité de la jurisprudence applicable ci-dessus citée.
[57]
Pour toutes ces raisons, la décision de l'arbitre étant en majeure partie bien fondée, il n'est pas indiqué de faire reconsidérer l'affaire dans sa totalité. Il y a plutôt lieu d'accorder la demande de contrôle judiciaire et de retourner l'affaire au même arbitre pour qu'elle révise et modifie sa décision, en se basant strictement sur la même preuve que celle déjà faite devant elle, de façon à simplement la faire accorder avec les présents motifs. Plus spécifiquement, l'affaire est retournée au même arbitre aux fins suivantes:
(1) pour qu'elle reconnaisse ne pas avoir la compétence pour se saisir du grief du défendeur portant sur la réprimande écrite et pour évaluer l'impact, s'il y a lieu, de cette reconnaissance sur le reste de sa décision; et
(2) pour qu'elle n'accorde pas au défendeur, directement ou indirectement, une compensation pour ses honoraires d'avocat et ses frais judiciaires.
[58]
Vu le succès partagé, il n'y a pas d'adjudication de dépens.
JUGEMENT
[59]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accordée. L'affaire est retournée au même arbitre pour qu'elle révise et modifie sa décision, en se basant strictement sur la même preuve que celle déjà faite devant elle, de façon à simplement la faire accorder avec les motifs émis ce jour au soutien du présent jugement. Plus spécifiquement, l'affaire est retournée au même arbitre aux fins suivantes:
(1) pour qu'elle reconnaisse ne pas avoir la compétence pour se saisir du grief du défendeur portant sur la réprimande écrite et pour évaluer l'impact, s'il y a lieu, de cette reconnaissance sur le reste de sa décision; et
(2) pour qu'elle n'accorde pas au défendeur, directement ou indirectement, une compensation pour ses honoraires d'avocat et ses frais judiciaires.

Il n'y a pas d'adjudication de dépens.
