Gibson, J.
: These reasons arise out of an application for judicial review of a decision or decisions of the respondent Celina Shepherd in her capacity as Electoral Officer for an election of Chief and four Councillors of the Ocean Man First Nation held in December of 1993 and for review of an alleged decision or implied decision of the respondents the Chief and Band Councillors of the Ocean Man First Nation, not to require the Electoral Officer to comply with her obligations under the constitution of the First Nation. The relief requested is set out in the originating notice of motion in the following terms:
1) an Order pursuant to s. 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
and rules 1107 and 324 of the
Federal Court Rules
allowing for an extension of time by which this court might grant an Order for certiorari and an Order for mandamus;
2) an Order for certiorari to quash the election of Lillian Big Eagle to the Ocean Man First Nation Council; and
3) an Order for mandamus to compel the Chief and Council of the Ocean Man First Nation to select an Electoral Officer and to direct that a by-election be conducted forthwith between Lillian Big Eagle and Tara Parisier.
[2]
Appropriate extensions of time to regularize the application for judicial review were earlier granted by the court.
[3]
The First Nation election conducted in December, 1993 was for a Chief and four Councillors. No issue arises with respect to the election of the Chief and three of the Councillors. Two candidates for council, the applicant and Lillian Big Eagle, received an equal number of votes for the fourth available council position. In her Electoral Officer's statement, the Electoral Officer declared Lillian Big Eagle elected to the fourth council position and provided the following comments:
"Lillian Bigeagle and Tara Parisier where [sic] tied. I chose Lillian Bigeagle, because she was a councillor before and with the spoiled ballot she would of [sic] won by one (1)."
The most relevant provisions of the Ocean Man First Nation constitution read as follows:
"34. Where it appears that two (2) or more candidates who would otherwise have been elected have an equal number of votes, the Electoral Officer shall hold a further poll not less than fifteen (15) days and not more than thirty (30) days after the election at which the Band electors shall be asked to vote for one of the two or more candidates who had an equal number of votes in the election.
"41. The officer [sic] of Chief or Councillor becomes vacant when:
a) the person who holds the office:
. . . . .
(iii) is or becomes ineligible to hold office by virtue of this Constitution, or
. . . . .
"42. Where the office of Chief or Councillor becomes vacant more than six (6) months before the date when another election would ordinarily be held, a special election may be held in accordance with this Constitution to fill the vacancy.
"43. Any Band elector alleging that there was corrupt practice in connection with the election or that there was a violation of this Constitution that might have affected the result of the election or that a person nominated to be a candidate in the election was ineligible to be a candidate may refer the matter to the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Saskatchewan for adjudication following the procedure contained in The Controverted Elections Act for Saskatchewan, as amended from time to time."
[4]
The respondent Celina Shepherd, Electoral Officer, filed no material and took no part in these proceedings.
[5]
Counsel for the respondents represented before me argued that this court lacked jurisdiction to entertain this application or, in the event that it determined that it had jurisdiction, should decline to exercise jurisdiction. Section 43 of the
Ocean Man First Nation Constitution
(the "
Constitution
") quoted above clearly authorizes a Band elector who alleges a violation of the
Constitution
that might have affected the result of the election to refer the matter to the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Saskatchewan for adjudication following the procedure contained in the
Controverted Elections Act
of Saskatchewan. It does not purport on its face to oust the jurisdiction of this court if that jurisdiction otherwise exists and I am satisfied that it could not effectively do so. The question then becomes one of whether or not this court has jurisdiction to entertain this application, notwithstanding the recourse provided by s. 43 of the
Constitution
.
[6]
The Chief and Council of the Ocean Man First Nation are elected pursuant to the
Constitution
which reflects the custom of the Ocean Man Band rather than the provisions of the
Indian Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. By virtue of the definition of "Council of the Band" contained in s. 2(1) of the
Indian Act
, the Chief and Council of the Ocean Man Band are nonetheless the "Council of the Band" for the purposes of the
Indian Act
. It is well-settled law that for the purposes of applications such as this, a Band Council and persons purporting to exercise authority over members of an Indian Band who act pursuant to provisions of the
Indian Act
constitute a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" within the meaning of that term in s. 2 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , affirmed [1980] 2 F.C. 792 (C.A.) where the Band Council, the election of which was in question, was elected pursuant to Band custom and not pursuant to the
Indian Act
). I am satisfied that, by analogy, an Electoral Officer appointed by such a Band Council pursuant to the Band Constitution is equally a "federal board, commission or other tribunal".
[7]
The Electoral Officer, Celina Shepherd, declared Lillian Bigeagle (spelling of the surname as in the Electoral Officer's Statement rather than as in the style of cause) to be elected in the circumstances of a tie vote, for reasons quoted earlier in these reasons. In so doing, I am satisfied that she made a decision that is amenable to judicial review.
[8]
I find no reason in law or in policy that should lead this court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction on this application.
[9]
Counsel before me were in agreement that the Electoral Officer erred in declaring Lillian Big Eagle elected for the reasons she did in the face of s. 34 of the
Constitution
. It was further agreed that an order setting aside the decision of the Electoral Officer would be appropriate. Counsel for the applicant urged that I go further and order the Chief and Council to select an Electoral Officer and to direct that a run-off election be conducted in accordance with s. 34 of the
Constitution
.
[10]
It is obvious that the terms of s. 34 of the
Constitution
cannot now be strictly complied with. The period within which a run-off election was to be conducted has long since expired. Though it is not clear on the evidence before me, the Electoral Officer on whom the obligation to conduct the run-off election was placed is most likely no longer in office. The obligation was hers, not the Chief and Council's. The
Constitution
created no obligation on the Chief and Council to ensure that the Electoral Officer fulfilled all of her duties, although a fiduciary responsibility to do so on behalf of all electors of the First Nation might be implied. Once she became aware of the irregularity in the declaration of her election, Lillian Big Eagle refrained from voting or otherwise acting as a member of Council. There is no evidence that the functioning of Council has thus been impaired. It is worthy of note that s. 42 of the
Constitution
quoted above, which provides for the filling of a vacancy on council, is permissive and the Chief and Council have apparently not found it necessary to resort to the terms of that provision. More than the six month period referred to in that provision but less than a year remains before the next scheduled regular election of councillors.
[11]
Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that the remedy urged against the Chief and Council is at the discretion of the court. I am not satisfied that it is within my authority to grant the remedy against the Chief and Council that is requested, since they were not parties to the impugned decision and have not acted on that decision. In any event, I am satisfied on the facts before me that it would be inappropriate to grant any form of relief against the Chief and Council.
[12]
For the foregoing reasons, this application for judicial review will be allowed in part. The declaration of Celina Shepherd, Electoral Officer, that Lillian Big Eagle was elected a councillor in the Ocean Man First Nation election held in December of 1993 will be quashed. In all other respects, the applicant's application for judicial review will be dismissed.
[13]
The following comments are no part of my decision or of my reasons for decision but I nonetheless record them in the event they may be useful. According to the material before me, the crux of the difficulty giving rise to this application was who would bear the cost of the run-off election resulting from the tie for the fourth councillor position. Apparently the additional work and expenditure arising out of a run-off election had not been contemplated at the time the Electoral Officer was appointed. In the result, the Electoral Officer was unwilling to conduct the run-off election without further compensation, the applicant, and presumably Lillian Big Eagle with whom she was tied, were unprepared to personally assume the costs and the Chief and Council never felt obliged to entertain the question of whether the cost of a run-off election should be borne out of the First Nation's funds.
[14]
The next election is approaching. It will be necessary to appoint an Electoral Officer. That person, whoever she or he may be, the Chief and Council who appoint her or him, and all candidates for election should be familiar with the tie-breaking mechanism set out in s. 34 of the
Constitution
and should clearly understand what the costs for a run-off election would be and who would bear them.
Application allowed in part.
