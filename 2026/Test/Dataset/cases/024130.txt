Cullen, J.
: Notwithstanding the wording of the motion, counsel for the applicant made it quite clear that this is a motion under s. 57 of the
Trade Marks Act
to expunge the registration held by the respondent. The said mark is "Club St-Tropez & Design", registration No. 363,608.
Background
[2]
On October 11, 1985 the applicant, incorporated under the laws of the state of California, applied for registration in the Canadian Trademarks Office of the trademark "Saint Tropez West" in respect of women's clothing, namely, dresses, suits, coats, jackets, blazers, shirts, blouses, sweaters, skirts, jeans, pants, shorts and culotte-bottoms; women's contemporary dresses and coordinate suits and women's clothing patterns. In its application the applicant claimed entitlement to registration in respect of the above-mentioned women's clothing on the basis of the use of the trademark in Canada since, as early as June 10, 1985 and in respect of the women's contemporary dresses, coordinate suits and the clothing patterns claimed entitlement to registration on the basis of use of the trademark in the United States of America and registered in the United States under registration Nos. 1,099,607 and 1,234,576. The application was subsequently amended on May 30, 1989 and is to this date pending registration.
[3]
The respondent, incorporated under the laws of Ontario, filed for application of the trademark "Club St-Tropez & Design" in the Canadian Trademarks Office on November 15, 1989 and was assigned application No. 619,145. On November 17, 1989 the trademark was registered under No. 363,608 in respect of ladies' sportswear, namely, sweatpants, jogging suits, pants, sweaters, T-shirts, blouses, skirts, outer jackets, dresses and shorts. The respondent is the registered owner of the trademark "Club St-Tropez & Design". The trademark design is reproduced below.
[See printed version]
[4]
The Trademarks Office approved the applicant's trademark and on January 3, 1990 the Registrar of Trademarks advertised the application in the Trade Marks Journal, pending registration of the trademark.
[5]
On April 10, 1990 the respondent opposed the applicant's trademark application. This opposition was subsequently withdrawn on April 16, 1991.
[6]
The applicant's position is that the respondent is not the person entitled to registration of the trademark "Club St-Tropez & Design" because at the date the respondent filed the application for the proposed trademark (November 15, 1989) the trademark was confusing. Although it was not raised in the Notice of Motion, the applicant also maintains that the respondent is estopped from denying that the trademarks are confusing, by virtue of the allegations set out in the April 10, 1990 opposition.
[7]
The respondent's position is that its trademark "Club St-Tropez & Design" is not confusing with the applicant's trademark "Saint Tropez West". The respondent is also of the view that the statements made in the 1990 opposition do not constitute an admission of confusion and are not pertinent to the proceedings.
Issues
[8]
Therefore in dealing with the question of entitlement, two issues have to be addressed: first, whether the respondent's trademark is confusing with the applicant's trademark and second, what is the effect of the respondent's filing and subsequent withdrawal of the April 10, 1990 opposition.
Presumption Of Validity And
Burden Of Proof
[9]
Before commencing a discussion on entitlement, it is appropriate to note that registration of a trademark confers certain rights and benefits to the owner, including prima facie proof of these rights and ownership of the trademark. Thus, when a trademark is registered there is a presumption of validity and therefore the party seeking the expungement of the trademark has the onus of proving its invalidity:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 134 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 213, at p. 217 (F.C.T.D.). Further, where any doubt exists regarding the validity of the trademark registration, the presumption of validity has not been rebutted and the doubt must be resolved in favour of the validity of the trademark. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (supra), at p. 134.)
Registration Of A
Proposed Trademark
[10]
Section 18 of the
Trade Marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, subsequently referred to as the
Act
provides that a trademark is invalid if the applicant was not the person entitled to secure registration. With respect to the registration of a "proposed trademark", such as the respondent's mark, s. 16(3) of the
Act
provides that an applicant for registration of a "proposed" trademark is not the person entitled to secure registration if, at the date of filing of the application, the proposed trademark (the respondent's mark) was confusing with a trademark in respect of which application for registration had been previously filed by another party, namely the applicant. In this case the applicant's application for registration was filed in 1985 and was pending throughout the relevant time period, that is to say from the time the respondent's trademark was filed until it was registered. Therefore, the material time for considering the question of confusion is the date of the applicant's application for registration. Further, the jurisprudence has established that where an opposition or the issue of entitlement to registration is raised under s. 16(3)(b), the court need not look at evidence of use of the trademark to establish confusion:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.);
401518  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Opp. Board).
Confusion
[11]
By statutory definition a trademark is confusing with another trademark, if its use on wares, services in the same area is likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or services are of the same general class. (Sections 6(1) and 6(2) of the
Act
). The standard for determining whether the use of both trademarks in the same area
will likely
lead to the inference that the wares or services (in this case wares) associated with such trademarks are provided by the same person or have a common source:
VISA International service  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 439 at p. 444 (F.C.T.D.). Section 6(5) of the
Act
outlines the circumstances which are to be considered in determining whether a trademark is confusing and provides that the court shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including:
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks or trade names and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trademarks or trade names have been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or trade names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.
These criteria are not exhaustive and it is not necessary to find that all the circumstances exist or that they exist to an equal degree:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  mind that a decision on the issue of confusion involves a practical determination of fact and therefore each case stands on its own facts.
[12]
The applicant has argued that the marks are inherently distinctive but not necessarily strong marks. Both marks include a reference to a saint and a location. With respect, I disagree with the applicant's contention that the marks are inherently distinctive. As pointed out by the respondent, St. Tropez is a geographic location in the South of France and I agree that it is accepted that St. Tropez is just such a geographic location. Further, geographic locations are not inherently distinctive and consequently do not deserve a wide ambit of protection. Although the applicant made the point that St. Tropez is associated with elegance, exclusivity and designer clothes, no real contention was put forth that "Saint Tropez West" had lost its primary meaning by use or otherwise and had acquired a secondary meaning nor was any evidence lead to support such a contention. The jurisprudence is clear that normally geographically descriptive words cannot be registered unless they have acquired a secondary graphic name or meaning or have become distinctive of the wares or services:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where entitlement was raised under s. 16(3)(b) of the
Act
and therefore I need not look at evidence of use to establish confusion. No evidence of use of the marks in Canada was brought before me and therefore I have nothing on which to conclude that the marks are or will be known in Canada.
[14]
There appears to be no dispute that the wares are essentially the same and as there is nothing in either the applicant's or the respondent's trademark application to indicate that the channels of trade are not the same. Therefore, I am entitled to also conclude that the channels of trade would also be the same.
[15]
In considering the resemblance between the marks in sound, idea and appearance, for the purposes of determining whether the trademarks are confusing, it is clear that the court should look at the marks in their entirety and not dissect them. I must avoid a meticulous comparison of the trademarks and instead determine the likely position of the prospective consumer having imperfect recollection of the prior mark:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In this case there are two trademarks, one has the name and the other has the same name plus design and script. The applicant submits that the distinctive feature of both marks is the term "St. Tropez" (however it is spelled in the trademarks). The applicant does not dispute that the additional material in a mark may enable an individual who has imperfect recollection and looks at both marks side by side to distinguish one from another. However, in this case the applicant maintains that there is nothing that would enable a person of imperfect recollection of "Saint Tropez West" from coming to any conclusion other than that "Club St-Tropez" is from the same organization, if not the same mark, if that person forgot one had "West" and the other had "Club". On the other hand, the respondent argues that although certain elements of each of the parties' trademarks, namely St. Tropez, are common to both, the respondent's mark contains differences that dominate the common words "St. Tropez" therefore minimizing the likelihood of confusion. The respondent submits that when viewing its mark "Club St-Tropez & Design" as a whole the court should note the word "club" together with the logo of the cartoon boy standing upside down on a skateboard along with the fact that the words "Club St-Tropez" are written in fanciful script. Counsel for the respondent cited
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 56 (F.C.A.), as a good application of the principle of where only one part of the whole trademark of each is common to both and the differences serve to dominate the common parts there will be little likelihood of confusion. In the
Chalet Bar B Q
case the Federal Court of Appeal was faced with a situation where the respondent had taken an action in infringement of six of its trademarks. The contested trademarks were in respect of similar services, a chicken restaurant's services. The court held that although the words "Chalet Bar B Q" were common to both the applicant's and the respondent's marks, the existence of the word "Swiss" in the trademark of the respondent was sufficient to render the latter not confusing with "Chalet Bar B Q". At page 73 Thurlow, C.J.C., stated:
"While the words 'Chalet Bar B Q' are part of the trademark Swiss Chalet Bar B Q, as it seems to me, the word 'Swiss' in that trademark and in the trademark Swiss Chalet is a sufficient signal to the public that this is not the same operation as that carried on in association with the trademark Chalet Bar B Q."
Similarly in this case, I am of the view that the word "club", along with the logo of the cartoon boy standing upside down on a skateboard together with the words "Club St-Tropez" written in fanciful script signal to the public that respondent's operation is different from that of the applicant.
[16]
After reviewing the arguments and having regard to all of the surrounding circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that the applicant has not satisfied me that the respondent's mark "Club St-Tropez & Design" is confusing with its mark "Saint Tropez West". The applicant's mark is a weak trademark and therefore does not deserve a wide ambit of protection. Indeed, both marks can be considered weak and therefore should be allowed to co-exist. Also the applicant has not satisfied me that any secondary meaning can be attributed to its mark. In coming to my conclusion I was cognizant of the presumption of validity of a registered trademark and that if doubt exists that doubt must be resolved in favour of the validity of the trademark.
Respondent's Statement In
The 1990 Opposition
[17]
The applicant has also raised the argument that by the alleging that the applicant's trademark "Saint Tropez West" is confusing with the respondent's trademark "Club St-Tropez" in its April 1990 opposition the respondent is estopped in this action from denying that the trademarks are not confusing. The applicant focused on that feature of estoppel that prohibits a person from approbating and reprobating at the same time. In his argument counsel for the applicant submitted that this is a situation where the respondent sought the benefit of pursuing the opposition proceedings in the Trademarks Office for at least nine months before the commencement of these proceedings, withdrew the opposition and is now seeking to deny that the marks are confusing.
[18]
The respondent is of the view that the statements made in the 1990 opposition are not pertinent to the present proceedings. The respondent maintains that there was no admission of confusion, that an allegation of a legal confusion was made, but no affidavits or argument were filed, the question was not determined by the Registrar and in any event the opposition was withdrawn.
[19]
After reviewing the submission I am of the view that estoppel is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case. The question of confusion is a legal conclusion based on a state of facts. As Ritchie, J., noted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 199:
"In my view, the determination as to whether or not a trademark is confusing within the meaning of s. 6 of the
Act
involves a judicial determination of a practical question of fact and does not involve the exercise of the Registrar's discretion."
[20]
Further, the statements in the opposition were allegations, perhaps of a legal conclusion but still allegations, without supporting argument, affidavits or evidence and without a determination of the question of confusion by the Registrar. I agree with the respondent that this is different from the situation in the
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  competitors alleging infringement, but actively pursued the matter until judgment was rendered in their favour. They then sued on another newspaper article and switched gears. In the case before me, the opposition did not go to its conclusion. In fact it was withdrawn. There was no judicial intervention and no "state of affairs" was declared. Indeed, the very reason the parties are before me is to obtain a determination on the question of confusion. The respondent also raised the point that if I find confusion based solely on the respondent's 1990 opposition, without a judicial determination on the facts, it would mean that the respondent by making an allegation has created a set of circumstances where a trademark incorporating the words "St. Tropez" will be confusing with other trademarks using identical or similar words.
[21]
The applicant has argued that if I decide that estoppel is inappropriate that the statements in the opposition are to be considered in the context of s. 6(5) of the
Act
, i.e., all the surrounding circumstances. As I indicated earlier, I have chosen to treat the statements in the respondent's opposition as allegations that were made without supporting affidavits or arguments and were subsequently withdrawn. The allegations do not constitute an admission of confusion, and as such should be of little or no relevancy. I find that estoppel is not appropriate in the circumstances.
[22]
I should add that at the beginning of the proceedings an application was made by the respondent for the late filing of affidavits. The application was refused.
[23]
Therefore, for the reasons outlined above I will dismiss the motion to expunge with costs to the respondent.
Application dismissed.
