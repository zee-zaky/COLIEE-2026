Gibson, J.
: These reasons relate to two applications for judicial review of a decision of an adjudicator appointed pursuant to s. 242 of the
Canada Labour Code
(R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2) wherein the adjudicator ordered Kenbrent Holdings Ltd. or its division, Valley Reefer Services, to pay Mary Atkey $19,210.75 plus post judgment interest from the date of the decision. The decision is dated the 15th day of April, 1994. The decision arose out of findings by the adjudicator that the dismissal of Mary Atkey (the "respondent") by her employer was "grossly unjust", that her employment had not been as a manager, and that she was not laid off because of lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function.
Background
[2]
No tribunal record was before the court. In the originating notices of motion, the applicants requested the adjudicator to provide a certified copy of certain materials, that would certainly have form part of a certified record, to the applicants and to the court registry. There was no evidence before the court that the applicants had served the originating notices of motion on the adjudicator as required by rule 1612 (
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 663) where a written request for a certified copy of material is included in the notice of motion. It may be that failure to serve resulted in the lack of a tribunal record.
[3]
In any event, from the adjudicator's decision and from certain material included in the application records filed, the following facts may be derived. The respondent was employed by Valley Reefer Services Ltd. ("Valley Reefer") from October 1, 1990. On or about February 1, 1993, Kenbrent Holdings Ltd. ("Kenbrent") purchased Valley Reefer. Kenbrent took over management of Valley Reefer on or about May 1, 1993. In the ensuing two months, the trucking business of Kenbrent was amalgamated with that of another company owned by Kenbrent, Fox Croft & Son, and that of Valley Reefer. A decision was taken to manage the Victoria operations of Valley Reefer, where the respondent worked, from the Vancouver area office of Kenbrent. On July 22, without any advance notice, the respondent was dismissed by the former owner of Valley Reefer who, at the time, remained in some capacity with the Kenbrent/Valley Reefer operation.
[4]
The record of employment provided to the respondent and dated the same date that she was dismissed, identified her employer as Valley Reefer. The respondent's complaint registration form dated August 3, 1993 also identified her employer as Valley Reefer.
[5]
By letter dated August 10, 1993 a labour affairs officer of Labour Canada wrote to Valley Reefer with regard to the respondent's complaint of unjust dismissal. The labour affairs officer's letter was replied to on August 26, on letterhead identifying the source of the reply as Valley Reefer Services (a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd.). The reply was signed by an individual identifying himself as "general manager", presumably general manager of Valley Reefer Services (a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd.), but identified in later correspondence simply as the general manager of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd. Further correspondence from the labour affairs officer was directed to Valley Reefer Services (a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd.) and identified the subject matter of the correspondence as being a complaint of unjust dismissal by Mary Atkey as against Valley Reefer Services (a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd.) rather than against Valley Reefer Services Ltd. which had been the indication of subject matter in the letter of August 10. Once again, the correspondence was responded to on Valley Reefer Services (a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd.) letterhead and was signed by an individual identifying himself as "president".
[6]
The style of cause on the decision of the arbitrator here at issue read: "In the matter of the
Canada Labour Code
and in the matter of a complaint under Part III Division XIV section 242 thereof between: Mary Atkey (the 'Complainant') and Valley Reefer Services, a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd." (the "Employer").
[7]
Affidavit evidence was filed with the court both on behalf of the applicants and the respondent. Given the lack of a certified record, it was not possible to verify how much, if any, of the affidavit evidence provided was "new evidence" that was not before the adjudicator. Counsel for the parties acknowledged that much of it was new evidence relating to issues that were not argued before the adjudicator or, presumably from the face of his reasons, considered by him. Generally speaking, it is the nature of judicial review to determine whether or not the decision of the board, commission or other tribunal that is under review was open to it on the
evidence that was before it.
Thus, new evidence is irrelevant to the judicial review. (See
Asafov v. the Minister of Employment and Immigration
, Court File: IMM-7425-93, May 18, 1994 (unreported) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). To the contrary see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  satisfied that an exception to this principle exists where the issue in question is one of the jurisdiction of the federal board commission or other tribunal the decision of which is under review. The new evidence presented was contradictory on the issue of jurisdiction, that issue being whether Valley Reefer was or was not a federal work, undertaking or business and therefor was or was not subject to the jurisdiction of an adjudicator appointed under the
Canada Labour Code
. Thus, I will decide this matter without regard to the new evidence presented.
Basis Of The Applications
For Judicial Review
[8]
In its originating Notice of Motion, Kenbrent indicated that its application for judicial review was based on the following grounds:
"1. The Adjudicator acted without jurisdiction and contrary to law in naming the applicant, Kenbrent Holdings Ltd., in the decision of the Adjudicator for the following reasons:
a) Kenbrent Holdings Ltd. is not a party named in the complaint filed by the respondent; and
b) Kenbrent Holdings Ltd. has never been an employer of the respondent."
In its originating Notice of Motion, Valley Reefer based its application for judicial review on the following grounds:
"1. Valley Reefer Services Ltd. is not a federal work, undertaking or business within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, and therefore Valley Reefer Services Ltd. is not subject to the jurisdiction of the
Canada Labour Code
."
[9]
Before me, counsel for Kenbrent argued that the adjudicator acted without jurisdiction and contrary to law in making an award against Kenbrent and failed to observe a principal of procedural fairness in making an award against Kenbrent after having failed to give notice of the hearing leading to his decision to Kenbrent, a hearing which Kenbrent, it was alleged, did not attend. According to the decision of the adjudicator, the hearing was in fact attended by one Clifford Lucas, described by the adjudicator as the representative of the employer and in respect of whom, the adjudicator described Kenbrent as "his company". Mr. Lucas gave evidence before the adjudicator.
Statutory Scheme
[10]
Section 2 of the
Canada Labour Code
defines "federal work, undertaking or business" in part in the following terms:
"'federal work, undertaking or business' means any work, undertaking or business that is within the legislative authority of Parliament, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing,
. . . . .
(b) a railway, canal, telegraph other work or undertaking connecting any province with any other province, or extending beyond the limits of a province,
. . . . .
(i) a work, undertaking or business outside the exclusive legislative authority of the legislatures of the provinces; and"
[11]
The adjudicator was appointed and empowered to act, and restricted as to his jurisdiction, by s. 242 of the
Canada Labour Code
which forms part of Part III and Division XIV and appears under the heading "Unjust Dismissal". In Part III, and for the purposes of that Part, "employer" is defined to mean any person who employs one or more employees.
[12]
Section 167(1) in Part III of the
Canada Labour Code
provides in part as follows:
"167(1) This part applies
(a) to employment in or in connection with the operations of any federal work, undertaking or business, other than a work, undertaking or business of a local or private nature in the Yukon Territory or the Northwest Territories; [Amended by S.C. 1993, c. 28, s. 89 to add the words 'or Nunavut']
(b) to and in respect of employees who are employed in or in connection with any federal work, undertaking or business described in paragraph (a);
(c) to and in respect of any employers of the employees described in paragraph (b); and
. . . . ."
Section 242 of the
Canada Labour Code
, after providing for the appointment of adjudicators, provides in part as follows:
"(2) An adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subsection (1)
a) shall consider the complaint within such time as the Governor-in-Council may by regulation prescribe;
b) shall determined the procedure to be followed, but shall give full opportunity to the parties to the complaint to present evidence and make submissions to the adjudicator and shall consider the information relating to the complaint; and
. . . . .
"(3) Subject to subsection (3.1), an adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subsection (1) shall
a) consider whether the dismissal of the person who made the complaint was unjust and render a decision thereon; and
. . . . .
"(4) Where an adjudicator decides pursuant to subsection (3) that a person has been unjustly dismissed, the adjudicator may, by order, require the employer who dismissed the person to
a) pay the person compensation not exceeding the amount of money that is equivalent to the remuneration that would, but for the dismissal, have been paid by the employer to the person;
. . . . ."
Finally, s. 243(1) of the
Canada Labour Code
provides as follows:
"243(1) Every order of an adjudicator appointed under subsection 242(1) is final and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court."
Standard Of Review
[13]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (under appeal)) Mr. Justice Muldoon, commenting on the privative clause that is s. 243(1) quoted above, stated:
"The court presumes to transcend the protective provisions of section 243 only if it be demonstrated that the adjudicator has so patently unreasonably stepped outside of the jurisdiction which Parliament conferred that the adjudicator can be clearly perceived to have perverted, evaded, avoided or contradicted the will of Parliament."
[14]
Mr. Justice Muldoon described the proposition that I have quoted from his reasons as "trite law" and for that description of the proposition cites a number of authorities. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 41 D.L.R.(3d) 6;
Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp.
, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227; 26 N.R. 341; 25 N.B.R.(2d) 237; 51 A.P.R. 237; 97 D.L.R.(3d) 417; 79 C.L.L.C. 14,209;
Teamsters Union, Local 938 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1989] 6 W.W.R. 673; 62 D.L.R.(4th) 437; 89 C.L.L.C. 14,050; 40 Admin. L.R. 181, in which Mr. Justice Muldoon quotes La Forest, J., at p. 1003 as stating "The tribunal has the right to make errors, even serious ones, provided it does not act in a manner 'so patently unreasonably that its construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review' ...")
[15]
Mr. Justice Muldoon goes on to cite an exception to the "patent unreasonableness" standard of review where the issue goes to the jurisdiction of an adjudicator. In such circumstances the appropriate standard is one of correctness. After citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) for this proposition, Mr. Justice Muldoon states:
"The standard of correctness for founding the adjudicator's jurisdiction means simply that the adjudicator must not make any error in exercising the powers conferred by and under Division XIV. It is presumed that Parliament does not will the exceeding of those carefully crafted powers (and limitations) and that its privative clauses cannot have protection of
such excesses
as their purpose."
Analysis
The Issues with respect to Kenbrent
[16]
I am not satisfied that the adjudicator erred in making an order against Kenbrent. The evidence referred to earlier makes it clear that at the investigative stage in relation to the respondent's complaint, the complaint came to be identified as being against Valley Reefer Services (a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd.) rather than simply as against Valley Reefer Services Ltd. That this was so, came to the attention of officers of Valley Reefer Services (a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd.) through correspondence referred to earlier in these reasons and those officials responded to that correspondence in turn on letterhead that identified the respondent as Valley Reefer Services (a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd.), not as a separate and independent corporate entity. No objection was taken on behalf of Kenbrent to this characterization of the employer against which the complaint was made.
[17]
Counsel for Kenbrent argued that it received no notice of the hearing before the adjudicator and that it was not represented before the adjudicator and therefore was not given the "... full opportunity ... to present evidence and make submissions ..." that an adjudicator is obliged to provide by virtue of s. 242(2)(b) of the
Canada Labour Code
quoted above. There was no evidence before me that Kenbrent did not receive notice of the hearing before the adjudicator. In the absence of a certified tribunal record, I conclude that notice of the hearing would have been given to the "employer" identified in the style of cause that forms part of the decision of the adjudicator, that is Valley Reefer Services, a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd. On the basis of that conclusion, I further conclude that Kenbrent did in fact receive notice of the hearing before the adjudicator and that, through its "division" Valley Reefer Services, it was identified as the "employer" of the respondent. Mr. Clifford Lucas, identified in the adjudicator's decision as "the representative of the employer" and in relation to whom, the adjudicator described Kenbrent as "his company", was present at the hearing. He gave evidence. He did not, apparently, identify himself at the hearing as being there only on behalf of Valley Reefer. Further, he apparently did not object to the characterization of the employer as "Valley Reefer Services, a division of Kenbrent Holdings Ltd." in correspondence relating to the respondent's complaint.
The issue with respect to Valley Reefer
[18]
As indicated in the discussion of issues with respect to Kenbrent, Labour Canada correspondence and the adjudicator identified Valley Reefer as a division of Kenbrent. Kenbrent was based in Alberta and it was acknowledged before me had interprovincial trucking operations between Alberta and British Columbia. Valley Reefer itself may or may not have had "continuous and regular" operations between British Columbia and the state of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 568 and 569 (C.A.)) The evidence on that question, which was new evidence before me, was contradictory. Whether it did or not is not determinative of the issue. The adjudicator found the employer to be Valley Reefer acting as a division of Kenbrent and cited the evidence of "the representative of the employer" before him to the effect that the representative's company, Kenbrent, purchased Valley Reefer and took over the management on May 1 of 1993. Further, he cites the same witness as indicating that the business of Kenbrent was "amalgamated" with that of Valley Reefer and another company. I am satisfied that it was reasonably open to the adjudicator to imply from these findings that the amalgamation of businesses resulted in a single undertaking or business that connected one province, that is, Alberta, with another province, that is, British Columbia, and thus the undertaking or business was a "federal work, undertaking or business" within the meaning ascribed to that expression by s. 2 of the
Canada Labour Code
and that therefore the adjudicator had jurisdiction with respect to it.
Conclusion
[19]
Based upon the foregoing analysis, I conclude that these applications for judicial review must be dismissed.
[20]
The Valley Reefer application for judicial review I am satisfied raised a question of the constitutional applicability of an Act of Parliament, that is the
Canada Labour Code
. Section 57(1) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, provides that where the constitutional applicability of an Act of Parliament is in question before this court, the Act shall not be adjudged to be inapplicable unless notice has been served on the Attorney General of Canada and the attorney general of each province. There was no evidence before the court that s. 57(1) had been complied with. Given the result, it is not a matter of significance. However, it is a matter that should be remedied by Valley Reefer if an appeal is undertaken in this matter.
Costs
[21]
Both parties claimed costs. Rule 1618 of the
Federal Court Rules
provides that no costs shall be payable in respect of an application for judicial review unless the court, for special reasons, so orders. I consulted counsel as to whether there were here special reasons that would warrant an order as to costs. Based upon representations of counsel, I am not satisfied that special reasons exist. There will be no order as to costs.
Applications dismissed.
