Rouleau, J.
: The applicant requests that the court issue an order against the Commissioner of Patents (the Commissioner) prohibiting him from issuing an interim or compulsory licence to the respondent Novopharm Limited (Novopharm). In the alternative the applicant asks the court to order the Commissioner to place more credence to the affidavit material submitted by the applicant with regards to the appropriate royalty payable by the licensee to the patentee. These orders are requested despite the fact that the Commissioner has not yet performed his statutory duty and rendered a decision with respect to these applications pursuant to s. 39 of the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, as amended by R.S.C. 1985, c. 33 (3rd Supp.).
[2]
More particularly, the originating notice of motion, dated December 16, 1991, seeks:
(1) An order prohibiting the respondent Commissioner from:
(a) considering further, determining, or granting the compulsory licence which Novopharm applied for pursuant to s. 39(4) of the
Patent Act
in respect of the medicine fluoxetine, owned by the applicant Eli Lilly Company (Lilly) under Canadian Patent No. 1,051,034; and
(b) considering further, determining, or granting the interim licence request made by Novopharm on November 14, 1991, pursuant to s. 39(6) of the
Act
;
(2) In the alternative, the applicant seeks a writ of prohibition or an injunction restraining the Commissioner, should he proceed to consider further Novopharm's compulsory licence application or should he decide to grant either an interim or a compulsory licence, from:
(a) taking into account statements on royalty made by Novopharm;
(b) granting an interim or permanent compulsory licence that does not contain a specific provision that any sales of fluoxetine are to be restricted to Canada; and
(c) granting an interim or permanent compulsory licence without affording the applicant an opportunity to be heard on issues relating to the export of fluoxetine; and
(d) granting an interim licence without affording the applicant an opportunity to be heard with respect to the quantum of the guarantee bond to be filed;
(3) An order directing that the Commissioner refrain from considering further, or granting either an interim or permanent licence, pending final disposition of this motion.
[3]
The parties appeared before me on March 26, 1991. After presentation of oral arguments by counsel for the applicant and counsel for the Commissioner, not having called on counsel for Novopharm Limited, I dismissed this application from the bench on the grounds that it is premature. The Commissioner not having rendered a decision concerning these applications, this court has no power to interfere until such a time as a decision is rendered. Counsel was then informed that written reasons would follow.
[4]
The issues raised in this application have long been settled by both the Trial Division and the Appeal Division of the Federal Court of Canada. The Commissioner has a duty to act in accordance with s. 39 of the
Act
and until such time as he has performed these duties, the court cannot interfere. Thurlow, J., in the Exchequer Court of Canada, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 98, wrote:
"In requiring the Commissioner 'unless he sees good reason to the contrary' to grant a licence 'to any person applying for the same' Parliament has imposed no qualification of any kind on the person to whom a licence is to be granted save that of being a 'person applying for the same', and there is no statutory requirement that an applicant prove anything to entitle him prima facie to the licence for which he applies. In particular there is no statutory requirement that he prove that he is competent to produce the food or medicine or that he is possessed of the equipment, know-how and resources to do so, though the Commissioner may consider it of some importance, depending on the facts of the case, to be informed of the applicant's qualifications and if he thinks necessary to inquire into them. Nor has Parliament defined what sort of consideration ought to be regarded by the Commissioner as 'good reason' why a licence should not be granted. However, by providing in s. 41(4) for an appeal to this court from the Commissioner's decision Parliament while leaving the matter generally to the discretion of the Commissioner has imposed the limitation that his decision is not to be made capriciously but upon grounds which an appellate court would regard as sufficient to justify his conclusion."
[5]
Further, the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , wrote at p. 144:
"Under s. 41(3), the decision both as to whether a licence should issue, and if so the royalty to be paid, was one for the Commissioner to make. While an appeal lies from that decision, in order to succeed it is for the appellant to show that the Commissioner acted on a wrong principle or that, on the evidence, the decision was manifestly wrong."
[6]
Though I am satisfied that this application is manifestly premature and grossly abusive of the process of this court, I am still prepared to analyze the arguments presented by the applicant, even with the full knowledge of their absolute futility.
[7]
The applicant is a research-based corporation that develops, manufactures and markets human medicines. In 1979, it obtained a patent for fluoxetine, a very successful antidepressant more commonly known as Prozac.
[8]
The respondent Novopharm is a pharmaceutical company that sells pharmaceutical products pursuant to compulsory licences granted to it by the Commissioner pursuant to the
Patent Act
.
[9]
The relevant statutory provisions dealing with compulsory licensing read as follows:
"39(4) Where, in the case of any patent for an invention intended or capable of being used for medicine or for the preparation or production of medicine, an application is made by any person for a licence to do one or more of the following things as specified in the application, namely,
(a) where the invention is a process, to use the intention for the preparation or production of medicine, import any medicine in the preparation or production of which the invention has been used or sell any medicine in the preparation or production of which the invention has been used, or
(b) where the invention is other than a process to import, make, use or sell the invention for medicine or for the preparation or production of medicine,
the Commission shall grant to the applicant a licence to do the things specified in the application except such, if any, of those things in respect of which he sees good reason not to grant a licence.
"39(5) In settling the terms of a licence granted under s. (4) and fixing the amount of royalty or other consideration payable, the Commissioner shall have regard to the desirability of making medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving the patentee due reward for the research leading to the invention and for such other factors as may be prescribed.
"39(6) At any time after the expiration of six months after the day on which a copy of an application to the Commissioner pursuant to s. (4) is served on the patentee in prescribed manner, the applicant may, if the Commissioner has not finally disposed of the application, request the Commissioner to grant him an interim licence to do such one or more of the things specified in the application as are specified in the request, and the Commissioner shall, on receipt of the request, serve on the patentee a notice stating that he may, within such period as is specified by the Commissioner in the notice, not exceeding twenty-one days from the day the notice is served on the patentee, make representations with respect to the request.
"39(7) On the expiration of the period specified by the Commissioner in the notice to the patentee referred to in s. (6), the Commissioner shall, if he has not finally disposed of the application, grant an interim licence to the applicant to do the things specified in the request except such, if any, of those things in respect of which he sees good reason not to grant such an interim licence.
"39(8) Section (5) applies, with such modifications as the circumstances require, in settling the terms of an interim licence granted pursuant to s. (7) and fixing the amount of royalty or other consideration payable.
"39(9) The Commissioner shall not grant an interim licence pursuant to s. (7) unless the applicant has filed with the Commissioner a guarantee bond satisfactory to the Commissioner, payable to Her Majesty in the Right of Canada, to secure the payment by the applicant of the royalties or other consideration that may become payable to the patentee under the interim licence.
"39(12) Any decision of the Commissioner under this section is subject to appeal to the Federal Court, except that a decision of the Commissioner with respect to an interim licence is final for all purposes and is not subject to appeal or to review by any court."
[10]
What should be apparent from reading these provisions is that they are mandatory. The role of the Commissioner is to issue a compulsory licence unless he finds sufficient grounds for refusal. It follows that the patentee has a right to a royalty based on use of the patent by a licensee.
[11]
The
Patent Rules
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 1250, as amended, outline the procedure to be followed in the compulsory licensing scheme. An application for a licence must be submitted in accordance with a prescribed form (rule 118) and supported by affidavit evidence (rule 119). Substantial compliance by an applicant with the requirements of rules 118 and 119 is for the Commissioner, in his discretion, to decide. If he is not satisfied with the evidence before him he may, at any time before he renders a decision, according to rule 126, request an oral hearing.
[12]
If the Commissioner is satisfied that the application meets the requirements of rules 118 and 119, he then decides whether or not there are good reasons why the applicant should not be granted a licence. If no such reasons exist, he then must instruct the applicant to serve a copy of the application on the patentee (rule 120). Once the Commissioner has decided that the patentee has been served with such notice, the patentee has two months, or such further period not exceeding three months, within which to file and serve a counterstatement setting out the material facts they rely on in opposing the grant of a compulsory licence, supported by affidavit (rule 121). The applicant then has an opportunity to file a reply (rule 122).
[13]
Section 39(16) of the
Act
provides that the Commissioner is required to render a decision within 18 months from the date the patentee was served with the application. However, if within six months from the date the patentee was served with the application, the Commissioner has not yet made a decision, the applicant may, according to s. 39(6) request that an interim licence be granted. Upon receipt of such an application, the patentee is notified and is given 21 days in which to make representations. At the end of this period, the Commissioner shall grant an interim licence unless he finds good reason to the contrary. Before the interim licence is actually issued, the applicant is required to post a guarantee bond to secure payment of the royalty.
[14]
It is in light of these statutory provisions and rules that the applicant's request for prohibition must be viewed.
[15]
On December 20, 1990, Novopharm applied for a compulsory licence to sell Prozac. In the application, Novopharm stated that it planned to import the drug in the form of bulk raw material which it would then prepare in dosage form. These capsules would be sold to pharmacists, physicians, hospitals and government agencies at a price of $1.14 per 20 mg capsule. Novopharm proposed that the royalty be fixed as "a sum equal to 4% of the selling price of the medicine in dosage form".
[16]
Mr. Leslie L. Dan of Novopharm sets out facts in support of this proposal in his affidavit. He points out that 4% is consistent with the royalty rate generally awarded by the Commissioner, and that this royalty has consistently enabled Novopharm to provide medicine at prices lower than those of patentees. He suggests that there are no special facts or considerations in the present case to warrant departing from this "rule of thumb" approach to setting the royalty.
[17]
By counterstatement dated August 2, 1991, the applicant made it known that they were opposing the grant of a compulsory licence on the terms requested by Novopharm. The respondent Novopharm, filed a reply on September 12, 1991, essentially arguing that the counterstatement put forth "no good reason why this licence application should be refused". Subsequently, on November 14, 1991, they requested an interim licence.
[18]
The applicant was advised of this request and given an opportunity to make representations. No further submissions were filed by the applicant; instead the applicant initiated these proceedings for prohibition on December 16, 1991. As of this date, no decision has been rendered with respect to either of these applications.
[19]
At the outset I should point out that the applicant is not seeking to deter or stall the issuance of a permanent compulsory licence to Novopharm. The applicant's primary concern is the Commissioner's "position", or "philosophy" with respect to the proper royalty to be paid by a generic drug manufacturer to the patentee of the drug. The Commissioner of Patents has, in the past, consistently considered 4% to be an appropriate royalty. Counsel for the applicant argued that the 4% "rule of thumb" approach is not consistent with s. 39(5), which requires that a royalty be fixed having due regard to the desirability of making the drug available to the consumer at the lowest possible price and rewarding the inventor, (i.e., emphasis on the latter).
[20]
Counsel for the applicant suggests that $1.14 per capsule is not the best possible price. Except for the costs of obtaining regulatory approval for their product (a far less costly procedure for a generic copier than for the innovator of a drug), the compulsory licensee does not incur any expenses with regard to research and development. Furthermore, they do not have to promote and establish a market for the drug; the market is already established. Consequently, they do not have to take such costs into account in their price structure and therefore they are always able to market a drug at prices that are much lower than those of the patentee. It is the applicant's position that generic drug manufacturers are able to earn a higher proportion of profit in relation to their costs than the actual innovator of the drug.
[21]
In the United Kingdom, the relevant legislation provides that royalties are to be determined on the basis of what "a willing licensee would pay to a willing licensor under normal market conditions". The generic drug metoprolol, for example, sells for approximately half the price of the same generic product in Canada, yet the United Kingdom generic company pays a royalty of 27%; whereas the Canadian generic company pays a royalty of only 4%.
[22]
The applicant predicts that at the proposed selling price of $1.14 per 20 mg capsule, Novopharm will make a net profit of 40% of its selling price. If Novopharm were to pay a royalty fixed at 27%, it would still make a net profit of 20%. If they are only paying 4% royalty, their net profit will be 37%. The applicant submits that a 4% royalty is nominal given the fact that Novopharm is appropriating the rights of the patentee and that he can afford to pay more and still make substantial profit.
[23]
The counterstatement filed by the applicant is quite lengthy, some 75 pages in all. It advances numerous arguments with regard to the amount of royalty to be fixed and why the Commissioner should deviate from the "rule of thumb" 4% normally awarded. In the counterstatement, the applicant provided the Commissioner with several proposals for the proper determination of royalty, based on the "willing licensee" approach adopted in the United Kingdom, the approaches recommended by the Eastman Commission Report, and the "value of the use to be made by the licensee" approach advanced by Thurlow, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The proper royalty, based on these approaches ranged from a low of 26.20% to a high of 35.85%.
[24]
Counsel for the applicant submits that rule 118(1)(c)(x) places an onus on Novopharm to provide evidence with respect to their costs, such as the costs of importation, processing, distribution and sale, their costs of obtaining regulatory approval, their anticipated market share and their expected profit margin on the sales of the drug, and that they have failed to do so. If this information were before the Commissioner, he then would be in a position to determine whether or not Novopharm could afford to pay a royalty of 4% or 20% and still make a substantial profit.
[25]
The applicant submits that Mr. Dan's affidavit does not contain any "material facts", rather it merely sets out law and precedent. The only relevant fact is the proposed selling price of $1.14 per capsule.
[26]
Counsel referred me to numerous cases which stand for the proposition that to act in the total absence of evidence is a jurisdictional error.
Re Keeprite Workers' Independent Union et al.
(1980), 114 D.L.R.(3d) 162 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[27]
Several decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal were relied upon where it had referred the grant of a licence back to the Commissioner on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to enable him to properly determine the royalty properly payable.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 (F.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. denied,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 257 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.);
Eli Lilly and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 (F.C.A.), and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 137 (F.C.A.).
[28]
With all due respect, these appeals relate to decisions that have already been made by the Commissioner. In the present situation, the Commissioner has not rendered a decision either authorizing or rejecting a licence nor has he fixed the royalty item that could be the subject of review by this court. What the Commissioner has presently decided is that he is satisfied that Novopharm's application meets the requirements of rules 118 and 119. This is an administrative decision and is normally unassailable under the usual judicial test. The Federal Court of Appeal held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1, at p. 12 C.P.R., 302 N.R.:
"What the commissioner does in carrying out his duty under s. 41(4) in order to arrive at the threshold opinion, when the rules take over and prescribe the procedure, is purely administrative. He is concerned only with the sufficiency of the application's compliance with ss. 118 and 119. Since it is for him alone to make that determination, it is for him alone, in the absence of prescribed procedure, to decide how the application is to be dealt with until he arrives at the opinion that it does comply or, perhaps, that it cannot be made to comply. He remains the master of his own procedure until he forms the threshold opinion and is entitled to permit an applicant to amend its application and to suggest the amendments he sees necessary to permit him to form that opinion."
If the information with respect to a proposed royalty is deficient, that issue should properly be raised on appeal from a decision of the Commissioner pursuant to s. 39(12) of the
Act
.
[29]
It was also submitted that if the Commissioner were to proceed further, he would be in breach of the duty imposed on him by s. 39(5) of the
Act
. It was suggested that the Commissioner, in consistently fixing royalties on the basis of the 4% "rule", is in breach of the duty imposed on him by virtue of s. 39(5) and that the appropriate recourse is to prevent him from breaching his duty at the outset, rather than on appeal. I totally disagree.
[30]
The law is clear, this court has no jurisdiction to prohibit the Commissioner from carrying out duties imposed on him by statute. As I said in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  an interim licence application is administrative. The discretion lies with the commissioner; this is what was intended by Parliament and this court cannot interfere with this decision-making process."
[31]
Furthermore, the applicant's entire argument is premised on the grounds that the Commissioner will decide to grant a licence and that he will fix the royalty at 4% and that this would be inadequate. This court does not deal in "probabilities". I have no indication what the Commissioner will decide. I am mindful that he has before him, compelling arguments submitted by the applicant indicating that a royalty in the nature of 27% would be appropriate. I am also reminded of what my colleague Joyal, J., said in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  apprehension of future unfairness, it is my view that the commissioner's discretion cannot be fettered by me at this time. The statutory powers of the commissioner and the manner in which he has exercised his licensing powers in the past have been scrutinized from time to time by the Federal Court and by the Supreme Court of Canada but I have failed to find the kind of juridical leverage which would be of assistance to the applicant.
"The applicant's case might also be stated as urging this court to prohibit an anticipatory breach of the commissioner's duties under s. 41 of the
Patent Act
. This in my view would be extending the scope of prerogative remedies far beyond its acceptable and proper limits. At best, such a remedy would be premature. The gestation period has not yet expired and one cannot and should not presume that the commissioner's ultimate decision will be stillborn."
[32]
With regards to the applicant's further submission that should I refrain from granting an order prohibiting the Commissioner from proceeding further, alternatively I should issue an order restraining him from considering the evidence submitted by Novopharm with respect to royalty insofar as it does not meet with the requirements of rule 118(1)(c)(x). With all due respect but faced with the peril of being repetitive, I cannot interfere with the administrative process.
[33]
Counsel for the applicant went on to submit that the Commissioner is without jurisdiction to grant a licence that permits the export of medicine, particularly when Novopharm has not requested or shown a need for the right to export. Counsel argued that the purpose of the
Act
is to introduce competition and lower prices in the Canadian market, and that the powers of the Commissioner are consequentially limited.
[34]
This court has held that the word "sell" in s. 39(4) of the
Act
is unqualified; see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 126. I might also remind counsel that I have no jurisdiction to prevent export. If the applicant objects to the sale by Novopharm of Prozac in the United States, they should commence an action in that jurisdiction. Furthermore, the scope of a licence granted by the Commissioner does not have to be restricted to the particulars contained in the licence application: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  premature insofar as the Commissioner has not yet decided to grant a licence that permits export. He has before him submissions made by the applicant objecting to the issuance of a licence that does not restrict sales of the drug to Canada.
[36]
Finally, it was suggested that the Commissioner is without jurisdiction to grant an interim licence insofar as the applicant has not demonstrated a need for an interim licence and that the provisions of Bill C-22 now in force would preclude Novopharm from making Prozac available to the Canadian public until November 30, 1988.
[37]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the patentee advanced the same argument, i.e., that the grant of the licence would not satisfy the objectives of s. 39(4) since the
Act
precluded sales of the drug by any licensee for a period of eight years. The Commissioner stated at page 251 of his decision:
"As the applicant has pointed out in its statement in reply, had Parliament had the intention that a licence for medicine would not be granted during any period of exclusivity applicable to that medicine it would have framed the new legislation so as to prohibit the granting of licences during such period. It is also my opinion that a licensee is not prohibited from importing a medicine for sale outside Canada during any period of exclusivity which may be applicable to the medicine in question, and therefore, I can see no reason why any licence granted should not become effective as of the date of signature."
[38]
In summary, I am dismissing this application on the grounds that it is premature. I do not have the power to substitute my views for those of the Commissioner, nor do I have the authority to prevent him from carrying out duties that he is mandated by statute to perform. I realize that there is a longstanding, smouldering battle between drug firms and the Commissioner of Patents over the appropriate royalty to be paid a patentee. The Court of Appeal has, on numerous occasions suggested to the Commissioner that he is not bound by the 4% "rule", but to no avail. Perhaps a directive from the Minister or Parliament would result in a system for determining royalties that the applicant would consider more equitable.
[39]
On the matter of costs, counsel for the respondent Novopharm, requested costs on a solicitor and client basis, referring to the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  worthy of increased costs, though not on a solicitor-client basis. As I stated at the outset this entire exercise was an abuse of the process and futile. The applicant has put the respondents through considerable expense, reserved two days of valuable court time all to no avail and the result of which was obvious to counsel.
[40]
The applications are dismissed; counsel for the respondent Novopharm is to prepare a draft Bill of Costs and serve it on the solicitors for the applicant. I will set a date to hear submissions with respect to costs in due course.
[41]
The respondent, the Commissioner of Patents, made no request as to costs; accordingly, no costs will be awarded.
Application dismissed.
