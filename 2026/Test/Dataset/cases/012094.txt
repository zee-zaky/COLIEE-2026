Walsh, J.
: In a motion heard in Toronto on March 3, 1986, Pfizer Canada Inc. seeks to be added as a party to the action brought by Apotex herein pursuant to Rule 1716(2) of the Federal Court Rules and to intervene pursuant to Rule 5 on the basis that it is a person that ought to have received notice of a motion brought by Apotex Inc. dated January 31, 1986, the hearing of which has now be adjourned to March 10, 1986. In its motion for leave to intervene Pfizer Canada Inc. also seeks leave to file a written contestation of Apotex's statement of claim, and that Apotex's motion be adjourned to allow Pfizer Canada Inc. to cross-examine affiants whose affidavits were filed in support of it.
[2]
The motion in which Pfizer wishes to intervene is in the nature of madamus sought by plaintiff directing the issuing of a notice of compliance effective as of January 24, 1986, under Regulation C.08.004 made pursuant to the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970 c. F-27 in respect of Apo-Piroxicam, 10 mg and 20 mg capsules, or in the alternative a declaration that plaintiff is entitled to such notice of compliance effective as of January 24, 1986. The significance of the retroactive date is that plaintiff contends that it will be excluded from the Ontario July 1986 Formulary of generic drugs made available to all pharmacists in Ontario and that the same may apply with respect to deadlines in other provinces, thereby causing plaintiff considerable damages for which it has instituted proceedings in damages of which the motion to be heard on March 10th forms part. It alleges that it had at said date complied with all the necessary requirements of the Statute and the Regulations arising thereunder.
[3]
In proceedings brought by Pfizer Canada Inc. against the Attorney General of Canada and the Minister of National Health and Welfare and Apotex Inc. under Court No. T-451-86 seeking an injunction enjoining the Minister from issuing said notice of compliance the attorney representing the Minister and Attorney General stated to the court that it was the intention to issue the notice of compliance immediately unless prevented by the issue of the interim injunction sought. [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  commenced by an ex parte application for an interim injunction were presented in the afternoon of February 27th in Montreal and were adjourned to 9:30 A.M. on Saturday, February 28th in order to enable the attorney representing the Attorney General of Canada and the Minister of Health and Welfare, and the attorney of the defendant Apotex who were in Toronto to be present. After a hearing lasting all day the injunction was refused in a judgment by Justice Teitelbaum. It appears from the reasons for judgment that substantially the same arguments were raised in that case as were raised before me in Toronto by Pfizer Canada Inc. in seeking to intervene in the present proceedings. Pfizer Canada Inc. which claims to be the originator of the drug Feldene (its trade name for piroxicam) which it manufactures and distributes and for which it has a notice of compliance contends that the Minister has acted illegally in determining whether or not Apotex has fulfilled all the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations in agreeing to issue notice of compliance to Apotex of what Apotex contends is an identical generic product. Pfizer contends that the purpose of attempting to obtain the interim injunction on such short notice in Montreal was to hold matters in status quo until its application to intervene in these proceedings in Toronto could be heard and dealt with. Since it did not succeed in obtaining the interim injunction there is nothing to prevent the Minister from issuing the notice of compliance which he indicated will be done and it may well be that before plaintiff's motion in which Pfizer Canada Inc. seeks to intervene is heard in Toronto on March 10th the notice of compliance, the issue of which Pfizer Canada Inc. seeks to prevent will already have been issued. While it may not be issued retroactively to January 24, 1986, as plaintiff seeks by its motion this would appear to be an issue between plaintiff and the Minister. What Pfizer Canada Inc. seeks is that the notice of compliance should not be issued at all without further inquiries by the Minister of National Health and Welfare and the provision of further information in the product brochure submitted by Apotex in seeking its notice of compliance as required by Regulation C.08.002 of the Food and Drugs Regulations. Apotex has a compulsory licence from Pfizer for the manufacturing process but Pfizer contends that it has done far more research as to what may be undesirable side effects of its use and furthermore that Apotex's proposed generic drug may contain impurities and in fact not be completely identical. An affidavit of Dane Carmichael, its quality control manager, produced only on March 3 at Toronto at the hearing of Pfizer's present motion indicates that there is some evidence of impurities  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's product, not found  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's which are not identified and therefore cannot be said to be not toxic or unusual. His tests were only reported on February 26 however, and presumably not yet brought to the attention of the Minister. Apotex for its part contends that in fact its product brochure contains more warnings than that of Pfizer, and that Pfizer's has to be amended to include such further warnings.
[4]
While Pfizer's counsel speaks eloquently of the need of rigid enforcement of the Regulations by the Minister of National Health and Welfare for the protection of the public before issuing a notice of compliance for a new drug it is also evident that Pfizer has a substantial commercial and economic interest in delaying as long as possible the marketing of plaintiff's identical or in any event similar product as a generic drug.
[5]
It was stated in court by counsel that Pfizer has also instituted proceedings against Apotex for infringement of copyright in connection with material used by it in its application, allegedly taken from Pfizer's product brochure. This is not the first time that such an issue has come before the courts (see for example Smith, Kline and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .) While Pfizer undoubtedly has a right to bring such proceedings I fail to see how any alleged infringement of its copyright by Apotex in any of its submissions to the Minister of National Health and Welfare when seeking the issue of a notice of compliance to sell its competing product as a generic drug can justify the intervention of Pfizer in the proceedings between Apotex and the Minister or that an intervention in plaintiff's motion would be a proper proceeding in which to decide Pfizer's copyright infringement claims.
[6]
In addition to the injuction proceedings in Montreal and the copyright infringement proceedings already referred to Pfizer Canada Inc. has instituted proceedings under section 28 of the Federal Court Act against the alleged decision of the Minister to issue a notice of compliance to Apotex. It would appear to be highly inconsistent to institute section 28 proceedings which require that a decision has already been made and at the same time seek to intervene in plaintiff's motion to be heard on February 10th in Toronto to try to prevent the issue of a notice of compliance. While there may or may not be some delay between the decision to issue such a notice and the actual issue of it it would appear that the second step is merely an administrative one involving no further decision, and, as already indicated, the notice may already have been issued. Pfizer's counsel contended that it may be that the Court of Appeal will decide that the decision to issue the notice is not in fact a decision to give it jurisdiction by virtue of section 28 unless and until the actual notice of compliance is issued, but this appears to be a very fine distinction and Pfizer can hardly argue or seek the right to argue the matter both ways. Moreover by virtue of section 28(3) of the Federal Court Act if the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to review and set aside the decision or order then the Trial Division has no jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding in respect of that decision or order.
[7]
It is evidence that Pfizer is leaving no stone unturned in its efforts to have an input into the ministerial decision, hopefully before the notice of compliance is issued. While recent jurisprudence under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms which it is not necessary to go into in detail here has held that even a ministerial decision is not immune from review if it is not made fairly or reasonably, and certainly if it does not comply with the law and regulations, it is clear that an administrative decision should not lightly be reviewed and set aside by the courts, as it is only in very exceptional and unusual circumstances that such a decision can be objected to and overturned by judicial review. A party seeking such a review must have a clear legal as distinct from a mere commercial or economic interest in the decision.
[8]
While the affidavit of William Heessels, Vice-president and General Manager of the Pharmaceutical Division of Pfizer Canada Inc. sets out the interest of the company in the licensing process and the good name and reputation of itself and of the product, its primary interest is clearly a commercial one. There is of course a philosophical and policy argument which is frequently made as to balancing the interest of a pharmaceutical firm which has spent considerable money and time on research as a result of which a useful product has been developed from the merchandising of which it is entitled to profit, (especially since it must also be compensated for abortive research into other products which have never developed to the stage capable of being used), with on the other hand the interest of the public in being able to acquire the drug made generically by a competitor for what most probably will be a much lower price. This is not an issue which can be dealt with in the present proceedings however. If every time the applicant for approval of a generic drug had to not only convince the Minister of National Health and Welfare that it was safe and appropriate to issue a notice of compliance it had to also confront and overcome arguments and objections raised by the originator of the product, which naturally does not welcome such competition, the Minister of National Health and Welfare would be placed in an almost untenable position.
[9]
While the Trade Marks Act R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10, specifically provides in section 37 for oppositions to be made by an interested party on an application for registration of a trademark and the Registrar must then consider such opposition as well as the evidence submitted in connection with the application, there is no similar provision, and probably for good reason, in the Food and Drugs Act. It is the responsibility of the Minister and his staff of technical experts to apply the Act and Regulations and protect the public, not to protect commercial and economic interests of competitors or even originators of the product in question. While, as stated any decision by him is not completely immune from review, it would appear without in any way deciding the issue on the present motion which only deals with Pfizer's application to intervene that the evidence that the Minister has not complied with the duty imposed on him in the present case is scanty at present to say the least. At page 6 of his reasons for judgment in the injunction proceedings, File T-451-86 (supra) Justice Teitelbaum refers to an affidavit of Mr. Heeseels filed in connection with those proceedings in which he states in paragraph 21:
"I believe that such an agreement (issuance of the notice of compliance) may be illegal and contrary to the public interest because it may not be supported by appropriate data)"
Justice Teitelbaum notes that the words "may" are used and that apparently Mr. Heessels is not quite sure one way or the other. In argument counsel for Pfizer stated that he had sought permission to participate or at least sit in on the examination for discovery of Apotex's witnesses in connection with their application for the notice of compliance. This had been refused because Pfizer was not a party to the proceedings which is why it now seeks to intervene. He stated however that these examinations lasted for some twenty (20) hours. This is certainly not an indication that the Minister's representatives did not give careful consideration to Apotex's application for certification.
[10]
In order for Pfizer to be allowed to intervene it has to overcome two hurdles. The first of these is whether it has status to do so and the second whether, even if it has the necessary status it is expedient that such intervention should be permitted. On the question of status counsel for Pfizer referred to certain jurisprudence including the Ontario case of Re Doctors Hospital and Minister of Health et al., 68 D.L.R.(2d) 220. In that case the hospital was one of several hospitals whose approval to operate as a public hospital was revoked by a decision of the Minister of Health and the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The hospital sought a declaratory judgment that this decision should be revoked as having been made without jurisdiction. Doctors employed by the hospital sought to intervene. At page 232 of the decision in answer to the argument that doctors were in the same position as the hospital and could not advance any argument being unique to them the court stated:
"On the other hand, from a practical point of view, they have an intense and somewhat special interest in the outcome of these procedings."
Reference was made to the decision of Lord Justice Denning in the case Re Liverpool Taxi Owners' Ass'n, [1972] 2 All E.R. 589, in which the taxi cab owners' association was held to be entitled to seek writs of prohibition and certiorari as "persons aggrieved" it being stated at page 595 that that included any person whose interests may be prejudicially affected by what is taking place provided they have a genuine grievance. Reference was also made to the Supreme Court case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 6 A.P.R. 85; 55 D.L.R. (3d) 632 which held that the factual situation has some relevancy to the determination of the question of standing. Accordingly the Doctors Hospital case held that the factual situation before the court was such that the doctors had a status to be heard.
[11]
Counsel for Pfizer also referred to the case of Re Starr and Township of Puslinch et al., 12 O.R.(2d) 40, dealing with town planning in which parties sought to be added to the proceedings under Rule 136 of the Ontario Rules which resembles Federal Court Rule 1716. At page 42 the court stated:
"There is no question that both applicants have a considerable commercial interest in the result of the judicial review application, because if that application should be successful both will be faced with the problem, not only of a rezoning application, but an amendment to the official plan and all of the consequent difficulties that might arise therefrom."
and at page 43:
"It is equally clear that under another interpretation any person whose rights are directly and substantially affected by the result of the litigation is a person 'whose presence is necessary in order to enable the court effectually and completely to adjuciate upon the questions involved in the action'."
In the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Mahoney, then in the Trial Division pointed out that Federal Court Rules do not permit the adding of a party as an intervenor and that Rule 5 cannot remedy this because pertinent Ontario Rules are similar to the Rules of this court. He points out that the Gap Rule has been invoked primarily to permit the joinder of intervenors in the Province of Quebec where the Code of Civil Procedure contemplates such a step but that in this court he would be intervenor must be added as a defendant if at all pursuant to Rule 1716(2)(b). In that case in permitting Twentieth Century-Fox to be added as a defendant the judgment stated at page 376:
"Fox has here a direct interest in the very issue to be determined. The decision here, if the plaintiff succeeds, will directly affect Fox's rights and pocket-book. While I accept that the present defendant will defend the action, its interest in doing so is obviously not to be compared to Fox's. Fox ought not be in the position of defending its rights vicariously. To require it to do so would entail a risk that its interests would not be adequately represented."
Applying this to the circumstances of the present case giving Pfizer the status to intervene as a defendant might well require a general conclusion that the Minister of National Health and Welfare cannot adequately represent the owner of any proprietory interest in pharmaceutical products when an application is before the Minister for the licensing of a similar generic product, and that in all such cases the pharmaceutical firm having proprietary interests in the original product should be made a party defendant in any application by another party for the licensing of a similar or competing product. As already stated the Statute does not so require and the court should not create new law by application of a Rule of Practice to require that such a party be added as a defendant. While Pfizer of course argues that it is only seeking to intervene on the facts of this particular case in which it contends that the Minister has not properly applied the Regulations in considering Apotex's application, a finding favourable to Pfizer on the present motion would create a precedent which would likely lead to a multitude of similar applications in almost every case where a competitor seeks a notice of compliance to market as a generic drug a product similar to that of the originator of it.
[12]
Jurisprudence referred to by plaintiff establishes that for a party to have status to intervene it must have a direct legal interest as distinct from an economic interest. Plaintiff's counsel points out that in the Doctors Hospital case the doctors in question would be losing their employment whereas in the present case Pfizer can of course continue to sell its product, the potential reduction of sales representing merely an economic interest. Reference was made to the Federal Court of Appeal case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which the Criminal Lawyers' Association of Ontario sought to intervene in an appeal by a prisoner on the question of the confidentiality of his letters to and from his lawyer. At page 94 the judgment states:
"In my view, the applicant has failed to establish a status entitling it to intervene in this action. In order to acquire such a status, it would be necessary for the applicant to show that it is an aggrieved party and that it has a proprietary interest in subject appeal."
On the same page reference is made to the judgment of Justice Le Dain in the case of Rothams of Pall Mall Canada Limited and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which he stated at page 506:
"The appellants do not have a genuine grievance entitling them to challenge by legal proceedings the interpretation. ... Such interpretation does not adversely affect the legal rights of the appellants nor impose any additional legal obligation upon them. Nor can it really be said to affect their interests prejudicially in any direct sense."
In the Rothmans case an extensive review was made of preceding jurisprudence. The headnote  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  summarizes the finding in part and states:
"A person should not have the right to interfere with an official action affecting an existing competitor solely to prevent the competitor from obtaining some advantage, particularly where the complainer is free to seize the same advantage. The public interest in competition is an important factor in the exercise of discretion as to whether to recognize standing in a competitive relationship."
[13]
Application of this jurisprudence leads to the conclusion that it is at least doubtful whether Pfizer has any status to intervene by way of being named as a defendant in the present proceedings so as to enable it on plaintiff's motion to oppose the actual issue of the notice of compliance which defendant the Minister proposes to issue and may in fact have already issued at the time the hearing on plaintiff's motion takes place on March 10th.
[14]
On the second issue, I have concluded that even if Pfizer had legal status to intervene which I seriously doubt, the intervention should not be allowed as plaintiff's motion would not be the most appropriate one for hearing of the objections which Pfizer wishes to make to the Minister's decision to issue the notice of compliance. While Pfizer is of course in an adversary position with respect to the plaintiff Apotex, it would appear that it wishes to place itself in an adversary position with respect to the Minister in connection with the decision to issue the notice of compliance to Apotex. Failure to permit Pfizer to intervene in the present proceedings between plaintiff Apotex and the Minister does not deprive Pfizer of all opportunity to have the decision of the Minister reviewed. It is not the function of the court to advise Pfizer as to what appropriate proceedings it can bring or whether prerogative writs could be used. Pfizer has already adopted one possible recourse by the section 28 proceedings which it has instituted.
[15]
In conclusion for all of the above reasons Pfizer's motion is dismissed with costs.
Motion dismissed.
