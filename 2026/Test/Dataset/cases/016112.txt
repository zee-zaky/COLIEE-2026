Gibson, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (the "CRDD") of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The decision flowed from an application by the respondent, pursuant to s. 69.2(1) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (the "
Act
"), "... to reconsider and vacate any determination made under (the)
Act
or the
Regulations
that a person is a Convention refugee on the ground that the determination was obtained by fraudulent means or misrepresentation, suppression or concealment of any material fact, whether exercised or made by that person or any other person". The decision of the CRDD was to cancel the applicant's Convention refugee status and is dated December 17, 1993.
[2]
The applicant, a Darod Somali who is a Sunni Muslim and a member of the Harti Tribe, made her claim to Convention refugee status in Canada in May 1991. Her application was granted by decision dated June 19, 1991.
[3]
In its reasons for the decision here under review, the CRDD stated:
"The claimant then testified. (The claimant being the applicant herein). She admitted having lived in the United States from 1986 to 1990 and having given birth to her two daughters in that country, contrary to her statements in her PIF. She admitted that she had not been a teacher in Mogadishu from 1986 to 1990 contrary to her answer to question 16 of her PIF. She added that she had deliberately given this answer. She also admitted that her answer to question 17 of her PIF - according to which she had lived in Somalia from 1981 to 1991 - was untrue.
"She added that she had come to the United States in 1985 and had met a Somalian in February 1986. They were married in June 1986. She then lived for almost five years in Virginia and worked in a Marriott hotel.
"She admitted having used the name Nura Abdi Buraleh in the United States, but then added that she used both her names; this would explain why she gave another identity in Canada. When asked why she had used two different names, signatures and birth dates, she answered that it was because of problems she had had with her husband and confusion surrounding her name at birth.
"She also admitted having obtained a U.S. residency card or 'green card' during her stay there. She added that she had come to Canada in 1991 because of her problems with her husband."
[4]
The CRDD then went on to refer to two exhibits before it, the first a letter from the Immigration Attaché at the Embassy of the United States of America in Ottawa, dated February 17, 1993, and the second a letter from the Consul at the Consulate General of the United States of America in Toronto dated November 30, 1992, in both of which the rights in the United States of a person such as the applicant are described. The CRDD then continues:
"Clearly then, the evidence has shown that the claimant knowingly lied when making her refugee claim by altering a number of facts concerning her name, her birth date and her past, by making up a story about her husband fearing persecution in Somalia in 1991 and by concealing material facts concerning the last six years of her life in the United States.
"The claimant presented a story which was completely lacking in credibility."
[5]
The options open to the CRDD on an application such as the one here in question are set out in ss. 69.3(4) and (5) of the
Act
. Those subsections read as follows:
69.3(4) The Refugee Division shall approve or reject the application and shall render its decision as soon as possible after completion of the hearing and send a written notice of the decision to the Minister and the person who is the person who is the subject of the application.
"(5) The Refugee Division may reject an application under subsection 69.2(2) that is otherwise established if it is of the opinion that, notwithstanding that the determination was obtained by fraudulent means or misrepresentation, suppression or concealment of any material fact, there was other sufficient evidence on which the determination was or could have been based."
[6]
The CRDD concluded in the following terms:
"Exhibits M-1 and M-2 cited earlier (the letters referred to earlier in these reasons) clearly show that the claimant obtained permanent resident status in the United States. It strikes us as senseless for a person who has acquired the protection of a democratic state and thus
most
of the rights enjoyed by the citizens of that country, apart from citizenship initially, to come to request protection from Canada,
protection the person does not need
.
"We do not share the argument put forward by counsel for the claimant that the United States may oppose the claimant's return. Among the rights she enjoys, as indicated in Exhibit M-2, is the right:
'to return to the U.S. from abroad'." (underlining added by me for emphasis)
In the result, as indicated earlier, the CRDD sitting as a panel of three, decided, unanimously, to cancel the applicant's refugee status.
[7]
It is to be noted from s. 69.3(5) quoted above that the CRDD has a discretion in these matters. It may reject an application by the respondent herein, notwithstanding that Convention refugee status was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, suppression or concealment if there was "... other sufficient evidence on which the determination (that the applicant was deserving of Convention refugee status) was or could have been based".
[8]
In the closing paragraphs of its decision, as quoted above, the CRDD concludes that the applicant herein had, between 1986 and 1991, acquired the protection of a democratic state and thus
most
of the rights enjoyed by the citizens of that country. Thus, it concludes, in coming to Canada to seek Convention refugee status, the applicant was seeking "... protection (she) does not need". While it might very well have been true that the applicant did not need the protection of Convention refugee status in Canada at the time she left the United States in 1991, she may very well need it now or have needed it at the time of the CRDD decision. The two letters exhibited to the CRDD's decision to which I have earlier referred make it very clear that she might have lost the protection of that country. The letter from the Immigration Attaché at the United States Embassy in Canada states:
"However, a permanent resident is obligated to maintain residence or to clearly show an intent to reside in the United States. A permanent resident who lives outside the U.S. over one year may lose permanent resident status. If a permanent resident in this situation applies for entry into the U.S., he may be put into exclusion proceedings to determine if he is still entitled to permanent resident status."
The letter from the Consul at the United States Consulate General in Toronto states:
"... they may lose their status if they relinquish their residence in the U.S."
[9]
It appears clear to me that the applicant has given up residence in the United States. Reference to the transcript of the hearing before the CRDD in this matter (pages 293 and 294 of the Tribunal Record) makes it clear that the applicant had demonstrated an intent not to reside in the United States.
[10]
The CRDD appears not to have engaged in the analysis that is contemplated by s. 69.3(5) on the basis that it was satisfied that the applicant is excluded from the definition "Convention refugee" by reason of article 1E of the
United Nations Convention
relating to the status of refugees signed at Geneva on July 28, 1951 and the Protocol thereto. That clause is set out in the schedule to the
Act
in the following term:
"This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country."
I conclude that the analysis engaged in by the CRDD simply does not support its conclusion that the applicant is so excluded. In its own terms, the applicant has "most" of the rights enjoyed by citizens of the United States. Among those that she might not have is the right to return to the United States. If she does not have that right, she may not fall within the exclusion provided by article 1E.
[11]
On the basis of the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the CRDD erred in law in failing to conduct a more thorough analysis to support its conclusion that the applicant may return to the United States as a permanent resident and thus does not need the protection that Convention refugee status in Canada affords her.
[12]
Having reached this conclusion, I further conclude that the CRDD should have engaged in the analysis contemplated by s. 69.3(5) to determine on the facts, as then known, whether the determination that she is a Convention refugee in Canada could still be sustained. If the determination could still be sustained, the CRDD would then be required to turn its attention to the question of whether or not it should be sustained; that is to say, whether or not it should exercise its discretion to reject the respondent's application in keeping with Canada's obligations under international refugee law.
[13]
For the foregoing reasons, this application will be allowed and this matter will be referred back to the Immigration and Refugee Board for reconsideration and redetermination by a differently constituted panel.
[14]
At the close of the hearing before me, I consulted counsel on the question of whether or not this matter raises a serious question of general importance that should be certified. Counsel before me were in agreement that it does raise such a question. Counsel for the applicant recommended certification of a question in the following terms:
"Did the Board err in law in failing to take into account the possibility of being subject to expulsion or exclusion in considering the rights attaching to an applicant under section 1E of the
Convention
?"
Counsel for the respondent recommended a substantially similar question but in the following terms:
"Whether or not the possibility of expulsion or exclusion is sufficient to render article 1E of the
Convention
inapplicable."
[15]
I am in agreement with counsel that a question should be certified. I will certify a question in the following terms:
"In disposing of an application under subsection 69.2(2), in circumstances where the individual who is the subject of the application has obtained permanent resident status in the United States or a status equivalent thereto and less than citizenship in another democratic state, but may be subject to expulsion or exclusion in accordance with the law of that state, is the Convention Refugee Determination Division required to consider that possibility in determining whether or not to exercise its discretion under subsection 69.3(5) of the
Immigration Act
or is the individual in any event excluded from Convention refugee status by reason of article 1E of the
Convention
?"
[16]
In framing the question for certification in this way, I am mindful of the guidance provided on this subject by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).
Application allowed.
