McGillis, J.
: The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) has applied to be added as a party respondent in judicial review proceedings instituted by the Attorney General of Canada (Attorney General) challenging the decision of the Commission to extend the time period for considering the complaint of the respondent Mr. Bernard. The Attorney General has opposed the application of the Commission on the basis that the procedure prescribed by the
Federal Court Rules
(
Rules
) does not permit the addition of the Commission as a party respondent in the judicial review of its own decision, but rather requires it to seek leave to intervene in the proceedings.
[2]
Part V.1 of the
Rules
entitled "Applications for Judicial Review" contains a procedural code governing applications for judicial review made under ss. 18.1 and 28 of the
Federal Court Act
. These
Rules
were substantially amended in 1992, making earlier jurisprudence of limited, if any, assistance in determining the question raised on this motion.
[3]
Under the
Rules
, the originating notice of motion instituting the application for judicial review shall name as a respondent "... any interested person who is adverse in interest to the applicant in the proceedings before the federal board, commission or other tribunal ...". (See rule 1602(3).) An "interested person" is defined in rule 1600 as being "... a person who was heard in the proceeding before the federal board, commission or other tribunal in respect of which the application for judicial review is made". In applying these provisions, the Commission does not fall within the definition of an "interested person". Accordingly, the
Rules
do not contemplate its addition as a party respondent in the judicial review of its own application. However, in order to ensure that, in appropriate cases, a federal board, commission or other tribunal may participate in the hearing of the application for judicial review of its own decision, rule 1611 permits it to make an application to intervene in the proceedings. Rule 1611(1) provides as follows:
"Any person who wishes to intervene in the hearing of an application for judicial review,
including the federal board, commission or other tribunal in respect of whose decision the application has been made
, must file a notice of application for leave to intervene and serve a copy of it on all the parties." (Emphasis added)
[4]
I am therefore satisfied that the
Rules
preclude the addition of the Commission as a party respondent in judicial review proceedings challenging its own decision and only permit its participation as an intervenor at the discretion of the court under rule 1611. It is noteworthy that the
Rules
have developed in a manner consistent with jurisprudence concerning the role of a board, tribunal or commission before a court of law. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 449; 89 D.L.R.(3d) 161.) I should also mention that, although my brother Teitelbaum, J., considered the role of the Commission before the court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), the status of the Commission as a party respondent was not challenged before him.
[5]
In the case at bar, counsel for the Attorney General generously agreed to consent to an application by the Commission to intervene in the proceedings, including any reasonable terms concerning the filing of evidence or rights of appeal. However, counsel for the Commission declined the offer.
[6]
The application by the Commission to be added as a party respondent is therefore dismissed without prejudice to its right to bring an application under rule 1611 to intervene in the judicial review proceedings.
Application dismissed.
