[1]
Annis, J.
: This is an application for judicial review, pursuant to section 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], of a decision that the applicants were not Convention refugees or persons to be protected.
Background Facts
[2]
Ms. Larionova, her father Mr. Kostiantyn Kuzmenko, and her six-year-old daughter Sofiya are Ukrainian citizens. Mr. Kuzmenko also possesses a Romanian passport. He was the principal applicant before the Immigration and Refugee Board. Ms. Larionova's brother, Daniil Kuzmenko, is deceased, leaving a widow and a now three-year-old son in Ukraine. Mr. Kuzmenko's wife Nataliya, and Ms. Larionova's husband Myraslav also remain in Ukraine.
[3]
Mr. Kuzmenko is a Chernobyl survivor and a recipient of the Hero of Chernobyl metal. In 1999, he decided to dedicate his life to working with children. Together with his family, he founded and ran a home for orphans and street children in Kiev. This started out in a rented building with 40 children, but by 2006 he was able to build a purpose-designed house for 100 children. The new facility had a dining-room, computer room, psychologist's office, playground, and carpentry and sewing workshop, and provided classes in music, art, and English.
[4]
In September 2010, representatives of the Office of Family and Youth visited the facility. They were angered to find that the children were being given religious education. The authorities began to tell Mr. Kuzmenko to cease reporting on the centre in the press and to contemplate closing it down. Local authorities informed him that he would not be funded and also requested that he close. However, small business owners continued to donate money to keep the centre running.
[5]
In autumn 2010, two men came to the centre. They threatened and hit Mr. Kuzmenko and demanded 50% of the centre's funding. He was given two weeks to pay $6,250 US. He explained that he had no spare money for this and that all donations went into the centre. They returned in two weeks and repeated the demand. Seeing his granddaughter Sofiya, they let him understand that "something could happen to her." Mr. Cruz testified that he did not go to the police because he was scared.
[6]
In spring 2011, threatening phone calls began. On April 29, 2011, Mr. Kuzmenko reluctantly closed the centre. In May 2011, the family applied for visas to travel to Canada but were refused. They were followed around town, and one evening Ms. Larionova's car was set on fire.
[7]
Mr. Kuzmenko indicated in his Personal Information Form (PIF) that the police at the scene told the family that they had "crossed someone" and the fire department determined that it had been arson. Mr. Kuzmenko requested police protection but there was no response.
[8]
Documents were entered into evidence that indicated that after the fire report, a statement was taken by the police from Ms. Larionova's husband on July 12, 2011 in which he indicated that the car was deliberately set on fire.
[9]
A further document of the police dated July 19, 2011 was entered into evidence that described a decision refusing to open a criminal case. In the report, Mr. Larionov is quoted as stating that he did not know why the passenger side of the car had caught on fire, that he did not have any enemies and did not observe anybody suspicious. Mr. Kuzmenko testified at the hearing, however, that he knew why it happened and who did it but did not know how he could possibly prove it.
[10]
The police report indicates that an investigation was conducted and no eyewitnesses to the event were discovered. The investigation included that of "antisocial individuals" known to be inclined to committing offences and crimes who were examined under administrative supervision.
[11]
Failing to establish anyone who could have carried out the act and noting that the car had cost US$400, it was decided that, although an unidentified individual had committed a criminal offence, due to its insignificance the act did not pose social danger and a criminal case would not be opened. This information was conveyed to Mr. Larionov on July 13, 2011. He testified that he was not satisfied with the investigation.
[12]
Mr. Kuzmenko testified that after the car was burned he went to the police and asked for protection because he was scared for his family and for his life. He related to the Chief of police how he had been kicked and his fear. The Chief of police was trying to calm them down and told him that he would send police officers to watch over his house. Mr. Kuzmenko states however that the Chief of police "was not burning of desire to protect us". After the Chief of police indicated that the car that was burned was not worth too much, he testified that he realized that he would not get any protection.
[13]
At the end of August 2011, Ms. Larionova, Mr. Larionov and the child Sofiya decided to attempt to enter Canada illegally for their safety. They obtained Lithuanian passports and travelled via Thailand, but were twice intercepted and taken off flights to Vancouver, first in South Korea and then in Taiwan. They had to return to Ukraine.
[14]
On September 8, 2011, Mr. Kuzmenko was telephoned with a threat against his son's life, being Daniil Kuzmenko. He was told that his appeal to the police and statements to the investigators had doomed the family, which apparently had been made after the fire. Two days later he was called again and told that he had paid dearly for his stubbornness. Meanwhile, on September 9, his son had gone missing. Mr. Kuzmenko turned to the police. After eleven days, he learned that his son's half-naked body had been discovered dumped on or by the highway 40 kilometres outside Kiev without identification papers, and had been buried with other unknowns six days ago. When he finally found his son at the morgue through identifying clothing he had been wearing and informed the police of the threats which had been received, the police did nothing.
[15]
Mr. Kuzmenko filed an application for an investigation into the inadequacy of the original investigation. A document was entered into evidence from the state prosecutor of Ukraine dated October 6, 2011 to the senior justice counselor in Kyiv referring to Mr. Kuzmenko's complaint and directing him to carry out an investigation. It included the application from Mr. Kuzmenko. The prosecutor was directed to inform the senior prosecutor about the results of the investigation.
[16]
The family had Daniil Kuzmenko reburied. They again attempted to obtain visas for Canada and were again refused. Ms. Larionova then bought false German passports for herself and her daughter and flew to the Dominican Republic and from there to Cuba, then flew into Toronto and took a train to Montreal. Mr. Kuzmenko already had a five-year visa for the U.S. from a trip to the 2010 annual convention of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Atlanta, Georgia. He used his U.S. visa to fly to New York, then took a bus to Buffalo, where he received a Canadian visa and was able to enter Canada and rejoin his daughter and granddaughter.
[17]
An undated summons to Mr. Kuzmenko's wife Nataliya was also entered into the evidence summoning her to attend before the police on November 30, 2011 concerning the investigation. Ms. Larionova indicated she did not know why Nataliya was called, "they were asking to find the murderers, but until now it's still silence about that".
[18]
They indicated that the authorities wanted Nataliya to sign a document ending the investigation. There is no further information on the investigation. There is no evidence that the complainants took any steps to inquire about the progress or results of the investigation.
[19]
Photographs of the deceased son Daniil were also entered into evidence. He was shown to be naked from the knees up with his shirt open and signs of severe bruising on his face and head.
[20]
Mr. Kuzmenko's wife and son-in-law subsequently reported that officers with the Service on Human Trafficking came to their residence (they were living in the former children's centre) with a summons for the son-in-law, Myroslav Larionov, who was taken to an office in Kiev and interrogated about the Lithuanian passports the family had used before. He was told that if he did not turn in the people who had sold them, his wife and daughter would be deported back from Canada and jailed in Ukraine, and that he would be jailed if he did not cooperate. His telephone was searched. After a few hours he was released.
Decision of the Board
[21]
The Board noted that the key issue was state protection. It found that the Ukrainian authorities had genuinely attempted to investigate the arson of Ms. Larionova's car and the alleged murder of Mr. Kuzmenko's son.
[22]
The Board did not believe Mr. Kuzmenko's allegation that the state had not acted on his complaint or his statement that there is "complete silence till today."
[23]
The Board, on its own initiative, researched the Criminal Code of Ukraine to determine the reference to s. 286 (2) in the letter of the State Prosecutor dated October 6, 2012 referred to above. The Board determined that this section addresses violation of rules related to vehicle driving safety which included the imposition of a term of imprisonment of 3 to 8 years in situations causing death or grievous bodily harm of the victim.
[24]
Based on this information and the fact that Mr. Kuzmenko's wife had been summoned to testify in the investigation, the Board indicated that it had serious doubts about the cause of the son's death, suggesting he was likely killed in a road accident. It noted that the state had acted on their complaint. The Board stated that "although the claimants are unhappy with the findings of the investigation, they did not show, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.
[25]
The Minister of Public Safety intervened before the Board with respect to Mr. Kuzmenko's Romanian citizenship to request that he be excluded from the claim under Article 1E as he was a citizen of Ukraine and Romania. As the Board had found that there was adequate state protection, it did not address this submission.
[26]
The Board concluded that the applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.
Issues
[27]
The issue raised by the applicants is whether the decision that the claimants are not persons in need of protection can be sustained on the basis that there is adequate state protection in Ukraine considering whether:
a. the Board erred in concluding, on the sole basis of the police reports, that Mr. Kuzmenko's son was not murdered; and
b. without taking into consideration all of the other evidence that the applicants were not refugees.
Standard of review
[28]
These issues refer to the Board's assessment of the facts. They are therefore reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Analysis
1. Did the Board err in concluding, on the sole basis of the police reports, that Mr. Kuzmenko's son was not murdered?
[29]
As a starting point, I am not satisfied that the Board based its decision solely on any finding of how the son was killed. The thrust of the decision, as I read it, is that the police followed up adequately on matters when requested to do so.
[30]
The claimants did not bring the issue of their being targeted to the police's attention until after the investigation of the arson of their son-in-law's vehicle. That incident was investigated with no suspects found and no help from the family; the son-in-law stating that he did not know who could have been responsible or how the incident could have happened. The applicants claim that a criminal file should have nevertheless been open, but to what end is not clear given the findings of the pre-investigation, particularly without the complainants not providing the information on their being targeted that might have assisted the police.
[31]
The later complaint to the Chief of police of the extortion attempts, described by Mr. Kuzmenko resulted in a commitment by the Chief to send police officers to watch over his house. Mr. Kuzmenko indicated that he was not convinced of the genuineness of the offer because the Chief mentioned that dollar amount of the vehicle loss in the fire was not a large amount. The evidence nevertheless, demonstrates a commitment to provide protection.
[32]
With respect to the investigation into the death of his son, the Board noted that the senior prosecutor pursued his complaint about the inadequacy of the investigation. He assigned it to a prosecutor for follow-up and demanded a report on the outcome. At the time the complainant left the Ukraine for Canada, the investigation was under way and his daughter had been subpoenaed or was about to be, to provide information as part of the investigation. Mr. Kuzmenko suggests that the summons of his wife was only for the purpose of having the investigation abandoned, which well may have been a topic raised given that the complainant, who initiated the investigation, had emigrated from the country.
[33]
What the results of the investigation were after the family left the Ukraine is a mystery; but the absence of information has to lie at the feet of the applicants. The only evidence that they provided was that they had heard nothing about the investigation. As the person making the complaint upon which the police were acting, there is no explanation why Mr. Kuzmenko did not follow up, or even that he had advised the police of his departure from the country. He had counsel in Canada and his wife and son-in-law remained in the Ukraine. He had already made one complaint that was acted upon. There is no explanation as to why he would not continue to press, or at a minimum, put on the record a request for the report to the senior bureaucrat so that closure of some sort could have been achieved on the matter.
[34]
At a minimum, Mr. Kuzmenko did not even enter into evidence his letter of complaint to the police. It would have at least indicated in writing his opinion that the cause of death of his son was related to his being targeted as part of the extortion scheme. There is no explanation on the record connecting Daniil to these events as someone working and living in Kiev with no apparent role at the orphanage. There was no indication of his desire to leave the country with the rest of the family who had attempted to enter Canada prior to his death. It is clear from the Board's comments that it was concerned that documents concerning the investigation were missing.
[35]
On the basis of the written documentation, the Board had a sufficient evidentiary foundation to conclude that an investigation had been carried out without any apparent help from the family, and that the complainants took no steps to inquire about the results of the investigation.
[36]
There is nevertheless some basis for complainants' submission that the Board erred in concluding that it had serious doubts about the cause of the son's death which it believed was the result of a road accident. It is hard to disagree with the argument that the son's condition as shown in the police photographs is in any way suggestive of a motor vehicle accident. In particular, without some explanation as to how his pants had been lowered to his ankles, his state of undress is not easily assimilated under the heading of a motor vehicle accident.
[37]
Of even greater concern is the fact that the Board on its own initiative consulted Ukrainian law to investigate the provisions under which the police investigation had been carried out and from this determining that it related to criminal negligence as opposed to some form of murder or manslaughter. The Board not only did his own research on foreign law, but also failed to provide the parties with an opportunity to respond to its findings.
[38]
On the basis that the statutory provision mentioned in the investigation letter related to criminal negligence in the operation of an automobile, the Board formed its belief that the claimant's son was killed in a road accident. There is no other source of evidence for this conclusion.
[39]
Obviously, by undertaking its own research and relying on the fruits of that research to come to conclusion not submitted by any of the parties in relation to an issue before the Board, it breached the fundamental rules of procedural fairness, which normally would require that the matter be sent back for reconsideration.
[40]
Although the issue of the Board undertaking its own inquiry was not a point raised in the applicants' memorandum, the Minister acknowledges that it would have consented to the matter being returned for reconsideration, except for their submission that the Board's belief that the accident was the result of a motor vehicle accident was not pertinent to the conclusion that state protection was adequate. In other words, it is argued that removing this finding out of the decision would not impact on the reasonableness from all of the evidence that the state was acting to deal with issues in a fashion that meets the requirements of Canadian law to conclude adequate state protection.
[41]
Normally, I would reject this argument out of hand but for the circumstances that apply in this case. The difficulty is that the Board did not know the nature or contents of Mr. Kuzmenko's complaint and what was the outcome of the investigation. The matter was proceeding, or had proceeded, we now learn after the fact under the rubric of a criminal motor vehicle accident. But apart from that, the Board had was photographs in need of an explanation as to the characterization of the crime and the complainants' evidence that the initial investigation was inadequate, including the burial of the body.
[42]
There is more than sufficient evidence to conclude that a subsequent police investigation was carried out into the investigation itself and that the failure to have the results of the subsequent investigation before the Board was attributable to the complainants. There is no evidence of the results of the investigation on the cause of death or what its decision was based on and what follow up would occur. The complainants could not simply stand by and rely upon their taking no steps to demonstrate either that the investigation that they initiated was not carried out, or the results on the cause of Danil's death were not supportable in some fashion on the basis of other evidence.
[43]
I agree the evidence before the Board, apart from any reference to the cause of death of Daniil appears sufficient to meet the standards of state protection as they are described by Zinn J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), at paragraph 5 as follows:
[5] Canadian law relating to state protection has been stated and developed in a decade and a half of Federal Court jurisprudence interpreting and applying the seminal exposition of the issue in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that decision Justice La Forest stressed the surrogate nature of refugee protection; it is only the failure of the foreign state to protect that will engage Canadian responsibility. Absent a situation of total breakdown of state institutions, the ability of the foreign state to provide protection is presumed. The surrogacy principle has raised various issues relating to the intensity of the presumption of state protection and the type of evidence that can demonstrate a failure thereof. The following principles have been articulated in this respect:
(i) The stronger the democratic institutions of the foreign state in question, the heavier the burden will be on the claimant to rebut the presumption:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2005 FC 193.
(iii) Evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption must be "clear and convincing":  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2007 FCA 171.
(iv) An absence of perfect or ideal protection in the foreign state will not engage Canada's surrogate role; "adequacy," not effectiveness per se, is what matters: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2008 FCA 94.
[44]
Accordingly, I accept the Minister's submission that despite the failure in procedural fairness by the Board going outside the confines of the hearing, assuming no conclusion was made on the likely cause of death, this would not nullify the evidence that the Board relied upon to sustain its conclusion that state protection was adequate.
2. Did the Board err in concluding, without taking into consideration all of the other evidence of threats, assaults, and arson including the general documentation, that the applicants were not refugees?
[45]
The applicants note that the Board made no adverse credibility findings and thus did not question the account of threats, assaults, and arson. They argue that the applicants' subjective fear was well founded, given these experiences. The objective evidence of incidents was credible and serious enough to warrant granting refugee status. The complainants argue that the Board's failure to take these other instances of persecution into account along with the evidence from the general documentation rendered its decision unreasonable.
[46]
The Board accepted that these events occurred. The evidence however, was that they were not brought to the police's attention until after the arson incident was investigated. Thereafter, the case turns on whether the state protection was adequate. These incidents are relevant only to the issue whether the state adequately responded, which the Board concluded was sufficient for the reasons described.
[47]
An issue was also taken with respect to the failure of the Board to consider the general documentation. However the general documentation did not suffice to demonstrate that state protection was not available, when there was evidence that the police had investigated the incidents.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Moreover, there was no allegation that the police had been corrupted or had been involved in the threats to the applicants.
Conclusion
[48]
The Board's decision was not unreasonable. The decision falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in fact and in law. For these reasons, the application is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[49]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application is dismissed.
.........................
Anna Larionova,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  présente demande de contrôle judiciaire fondée sur le paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR], vise la décision portant que les demandeurs n'ont qualité ni de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni de personnes à protéger.
Les faits
[2]
Mme Larionova, son père, M. Kostiantyn Kuzmenko, et sa fille âgée de six ans, Sofiya Larionova, sont citoyens ukrainiens. M. Kuzmenko possède aussi un passeport roumain. Il était le demandeur principal devant la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié. Le frère de Mme Larionova, Daniil Kuzmenko, est décédé, laissant en Ukraine une veuve et un fils maintenant âgé de trois ans. La femme de M. Kuzmenko, Nataliya, et le mari de Mme Larionova, Myraslav, sont également restés en Ukraine.
[3]
M. Kuzmenko est un survivant de Chernobyl, récipiendaire de la médaille de Héro de Chernobyl. En 1999, il a décidé de consacrer sa vie à travailler pour les enfants. Avec sa famille, il a fondé et dirigé un foyer, pour les orphelins et les enfants de la rue de Kiev. Il a commencé par louer un immeuble, dans lequel il a hébergé 40 enfants puis, en 2006, il a pu construire un centre adapté pouvant recevoir 100 enfants. Le nouvel établissement possédait une cafétéria, une salle d'ordinateurs, un bureau de psychologue, un terrain de jeu et des ateliers de menuiserie et de couture, et il donnait des cours de musique, d'art et d'anglais.
[4]
Au mois de septembre 2010, des représentants du Bureau de la famille et de la jeunesse ont visité l'établissement. Ils ont été mécontents de voir que les enfants recevaient une éducation religieuse. Les autorités ont commencé à dire à M. Kuzmenko de ne plus parler du centre à la presse et d'envisager sa fermeture. Les autorités locales l'ont informé qu'il n'aurait pas de subvention et lui ont aussi demandé de fermer le centre. Toutefois, de petits propriétaires d'entreprises ont continué à faire des dons pour que le centre reste ouvert.
[5]
À l'automne 2010, deux hommes sont venus au centre, ont menacé et frappé M. Kuzmenko et ont exigé la moitié des fonds du centre, lui donnant deux semaines pour verser 6 250 $ US. Il leur a expliqué qu'il n'avait pas l'argent nécessaire pour un tel versement et que tous les dons allaient au centre. Ils sont revenus deux semaines plus tard et ont réitéré leur demande. Apercevant sa petite-fille Sofiya, ils ont insinué que [traduction] « quelque chose pourrait lui arriver ». M. Cruz a témoigné qu'il ne s'était pas adressé à la police parce qu'il avait peur.
[6]
Au printemps 2011, des appels de menace ont commencé. Le 29 avril 2011, M. Kuzmenko s'est résigné à fermer le centre. Au mois de mai 2011, la famille a fait une demande de visas pour venir au Canada, mais elle ne les a pas obtenus. Ils étaient suivis lorsqu'ils sortaient et, un soir, l'auto de Mme Larionova a été incendiée.
[7]
M. Kuzmenko a indiqué dans son formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) que la police avait dit, sur les lieux, qu'ils avaient [traduction] « contrarié quelqu'un » et que le service des incendies avait conclu à un incendie criminel. M. Kuzmenko a demandé la protection de la police, mais on ne lui a pas répondu.
[8]
Ont été déposés en preuve des documents indiquant qu'après le signalement de l'incendie, la police a pris la déposition du mari de Mme Larionova, le 12 juillet 2011, et que celui-ci a déclaré que l'auto avait été délibérément incendiée.
[9]
Un autre document de la police, daté du 19 juillet 2011, a été mis en preuve. Il décrit la décision de ne pas ouvrir d'enquête criminelle. Le rapport indique que M. Larionov aurait déclaré qu'il ne savait pas pourquoi la voiture avait brûlé du côté passager, qu'il n'avait pas d'ennemi et qu'il n'avait observé aucun individu suspect. Toutefois, M. Kuzmenko a témoigné à l'audience qu'il savait pourquoi cela s'était produit et qui l'avait fait, mais qu'il ne voyait pas comment il pourrait le prouver.
[10]
Il appert du rapport de police qu'une enquête a été menée et qu'aucun témoin oculaire n'a été trouvé. Les enquêteurs ont notamment interrogé sous supervision administrative des « éléments antisociaux » dont les penchants criminels étaient connus.
[11]
La police n'ayant identifié personne qui aurait pu commettre le crime, elle a décidé, l'auto n'ayant coûté que 400 $ US, qu'il n'y avait pas lieu d'ouvrir un dossier criminel, bien qu'un individu non identifié ait commis un crime, parce que l'acte ne présentait pas un danger social vu son peu de gravité. Elle a fait part de sa décision à M. Larionov le 13 juillet 2011. Il a témoigné qu'il était mécontent de l'enquête.
[12]
M. Kuzmenko a déclaré avoir demandé la protection de la police, après l'incendie, parce qu'il avait peur que sa famille et sa vie soient en danger. Il a fait état de cette crainte au chef de police en lui décrivant l'agression qu'il avait subie. Ce dernier a tenté de les calmer et lui a dit qu'il enverrait des policiers surveiller sa maison. M. Kuzmenko affirme toutefois que le chef de police [traduction] « ne brûlait pas du désir de nous protéger ». Il a témoigné qu'il a compris qu'il n'obtiendrait pas de protection lorsque le chef a mentionné le peu de valeur de l'auto incendiée.
[13]
À la fin d'août 2011, Mme Larionova et M. Larionov ont décidé de tenter d'entrer illégalement au Canada, avec leur fille Sofiya, pour se mettre en sécurité. Ils ont obtenu des passeports lithuaniens et ont transité par la Thaïlande mais, par deux fois, ils ont été interceptés et empêchés de prendre l'avion pour Vancouver, d'abord en Corée du Sud puis à Taïwan.
[14]
Le 8 septembre 2011, M. Kuzmenko a reçu un appel menaçant son fils, Daniil Kuzmenko, de mort. On lui a dit qu'en s'adressant à la police et en lui faisant des déclarations, après l'incendie, apparemment, il avait scellé le sort de sa famille. Deux jours plus tard, il a reçu un autre appel lui disant qu'il avait payé cher son entêtement. Entretemps, son fils avait disparu, le 9 septembre. M. Kuzmenko a fait appel à la police. Onze jours après, il a appris que le corps à moitié nu de son fils avait été découvert, gisant près d'une route à 40 kilomètres de Kiev, sans papier, et qu'il avait été inhumé avec d'autres personnes non identifiées six jours auparavant. Lorsqu'il a identifié le corps de son fils à la morgue au moyen des vêtements qu'il portait et qu'il a fait part à la police des menaces qu'il avait reçues, la police n'a rien fait.
[15]
M. Kuzmenko a déposé une demande afin de faire vérifier si l'enquête initiale avait été bien menée. A été produit en preuve un document en date du 6 octobre 2011 émanant du procureur de l'État et adressé au conseiller juridique principal de Kiev, qui mentionnait la plainte de M. Kuzmenko et enjoignait de procéder à une enquête. Ce document renfermait la demande de M. Kuzmenko et donnait instruction d'informer le procureur du résultat de l'enquête.
[16]
La famille a fait réinhumer Daniil Kuzmenko. Elle a tenté une nouvelle fois, toujours sans succès, d'obtenir des visas pour le Canada. Mme Larionova s'est alors procuré de faux passeports allemands pour elle et sa fille, et elle a pris un vol pour la République dominicaine puis pour Cuba et, de là, a pris l'avion pour Toronto et, ensuite, le train pour Montréal. M. Kuzmenko possédait déjà un visa pour les États-Unis, valide pour cinq ans, qu'il avait obtenu en 2010 pour assister à un congrès de l'Église adventiste du septième jour à Atlanta, en Géorgie. Il s'est rendu à New York et a pris l'autobus pour Buffalo, où il a obtenu un visa pour le Canada, et il a pu entrer au pays et rejoindre sa fille et sa petite-fille.
[17]
Une assignation non datée envoyée à la femme de M. Kuzmenko et lui intimant de se présenter devant la police le 30 novembre 2011 au sujet de l'enquête a aussi été déposée en preuve. Mme Larionova a dit ignorer pourquoi Nataliya avait été convoquée, [traduction] « ils posaient des questions pour trouver les meurtriers, mais nous sommes toujours sans réponse ».
[18]
Ils ont indiqué que les autorités voulaient que Nataliya signe un document mettant fin à l'enquête. Il n'y a aucun autre renseignement au sujet de l'enquête. Aucun élément de preuve n'indique que les plaignants ont cherché à connaître la progression ou les résultats de l'enquête.
[19]
Des photos du fils décédé ont été déposées en preuve. Elles montrent un corps dénudé à partir des genoux, la chemise ouverte, et portant des signes de contusions graves au visage et à la tête.
[20]
La femme et le gendre de M. Kuzmenko ont subséquemment indiqué que des agents du Service de la traite de personnes se sont présentés à leur domicile (dans l'ancien centre pour enfants) munis d'une assignation visant le gendre, Myroslav Larionov, qu'ils ont emmené à un bureau de Kiev où il a été interrogé au sujet des passeports lithuaniens que la famille avait déjà utilisés. On lui a dit que s'il ne dénonçait pas ceux qui les lui avaient vendus, sa femme et sa fille seraient expulsées du Canada et mises en prison en Ukraine et que lui-même serait incarcéré s'il ne collaborait pas. Son téléphone a été perquisitionné. Il a été relâché quelques heures plus tard.
Décision de la Commission
[21]
La Commission a indiqué que la question déterminante était celle de la protection de l'État, et elle a jugé que les autorités ukrainiennes avaient réellement tenté de faire enquête au sujet de l'incendie criminel de l'auto de Mme Larionova et du meurtre allégué du fils de M. Kuzmenko.
[22]
La Commission n'a pas cru l'allégation de M. Kuzmenko voulant que l'État n'ait pas donné suite à sa plainte et que les autorités ne lui aient fourni [traduction] « aucune réponse à ce jour ».
[23]
De son propre chef, la Commission a consulté le Code criminel de l'Ukraine au sujet du paragraphe 286(2) du Code cité dans la lettre en date du 6 octobre 2012 du procureur de l'État, susmentionnée. Elle a conclu que cette disposition se rapportait à la violation des règles de sécurité routière et prévoyait une peine d'emprisonnement de trois à huit ans en cas de violation entraînant la mort ou un préjudice corporel grave.
[24]
Se fondant sur ce renseignement et sur le fait que la femme de M. Kuzmenko avait été assignée à témoigner dans le cadre de l'enquête, la Commission a indiqué qu'elle avait de sérieux doutes au sujet de la cause du décès du fils, exprimant l'avis qu'il résultait probablement d'un accident de la route. Elle a fait remarquer que l'État avait donné suite à la plainte, et indiqué que « [b] ien que les demandeurs d'asile soient mécontents des constatations de l'enquête, ils n'ont pas réussi à prouver, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la protection offerte par l'État est inappropriée ».
[25]
Le ministre de la Sécurité publique est intervenu devant la Commission relativement à la citoyenneté roumaine de M. Kuzmenko et a demandé l'exclusion de ce dernier en application de l'article premier, section E, puisqu'il était citoyen de l'Ukraine et de la Roumanie. La Commission ayant conclu à la suffisance de la protection de l'État, elle ne s'est pas prononcée sur ce point.
[26]
La Commission a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient qualité ni de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni de personnes à protéger.
Les questions soulevées
[27]
Les demandeurs prient la Cour de déterminer si la décision portant qu'ils n'ont pas qualité de personne à protéger parce que la protection de l'État en Ukraine est suffisante peut-être maintenue, étant donné les questions de savoir si la Commission a:
a. commis une erreur en concluant que le fils de M. Kuzmenko n'avait pas été victime de meurtre en se fondant uniquement sur les rapports de police,
b. et commis une erreur en concluant que les demandeurs n'avaient pas qualité de réfugié sans prendre en compte les autres éléments de preuve.
La norme de contrôle
[28]
Ces questions se rapportant à l'appréciation des faits, elles appellent l'application de la norme de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Analyse
1. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le fils de M. Kuzmenko n'avait pas été victime de meurtre en se fondant uniquement sur les rapports de police?
[29]
Pour commencer, on ne m'a pas convaincu que la Commission a fondé sa décision uniquement sur une quelconque conclusion relative à la cause du décès du fils. Telle que je la comprends, la décision conclut en substance que la police a répondu adéquatement lorsqu'on s'est adressé à elle.
[30]
Les demandeurs n'ont signalé à la police qu'ils étaient ciblés qu'après l'enquête relative à l'incendie criminel de l'auto du gendre. Il y a eu enquête, mais aucun suspect n'a été identifié, et la famille n'a fourni aucune aide; le gendre a déclaré qu'il ne savait pas qui avait pu mettre le feu ni comment l'incident avait pu se produire. Les demandeurs prétendent qu'un dossier criminel aurait quand même dû être ouvert, mais on ne voit pas trop dans quel but, étant donné les conclusions de la préenquête et, plus particulièrement, le fait que les plaignants n'avaient pas transmis à la police l'information qu'ils étaient ciblés, laquelle aurait pu être utile à celle-ci.
[31]
Le chef de police, lorsque la plainte subséquente relative aux tentatives d'extorsion décrites par M. Kuzmenko lui a été soumise, s'est engagé à envoyer des policiers surveiller la maison. M. Kuzmenko a dit douter de l'authenticité de l'offre de protection parce que le chef de police avait déclaré que le véhicule incendié n'avait pas une grande valeur. La preuve établit néanmoins qu'il y a eu engagement à fournir protection.
[32]
Pour ce qui est de l'enquête sur le décès du fils, la Commission a relevé que le procureur principal a reçu la plainte relative aux lacunes de l'enquête. Il l'a transmise à un procureur pour qu'il y donne suite et a demandé un compte-rendu du résultat. Lorsque le plaignant a quitté l'Ukraine pour le Canada, l'enquête suivait son cours, et sa fille avait été assignée ou était sur le point de l'être afin de fournir des renseignements dans le cadre de l'enquête. M. Kuzmenko affirme que l'assignation de sa femme visait uniquement l'abandon de l'enquête, sujet qui a fort bien pu être abordé étant donné que le plaignant à l'origine de l'enquête avait émigré.
[33]
Ce qu'il est advenu de l'enquête après le départ de la famille de l'Ukraine est un mystère, mais l'absence d'information n'est attribuable qu'aux demandeurs. Leur témoignage s'est borné à dire qu'ils n'avaient eu aucune nouvelle de l'enquête. Rien n'explique pourquoi M. Kuzmenko, l'auteur de la plainte à l'origine de l'enquête, n'a pas effectué de suivi ni n'indique même qu'il ait informé la police de son départ du pays. Il avait un avocat au Canada, et sa femme et son gendre étaient restés en Ukraine. Il avait déjà formulé une plainte qui avait eu des suites. Rien n'explique pourquoi il ne pouvait pas continuer à faire pression ou, à toute le moins, à demander le rapport préparé à l'intention du haut fonctionnaire afin que l'affaire parvienne à une conclusion quelconque.
[34]
M. Kuzmenko n'a même pas produit en preuve la plainte soumise à la police. Elle aurait au moins constitué une indication écrite de son opinion que le décès de son fils était lié aux tentatives d'extorsion dont il était l'objet. Rien dans le dossier ne lie Daniil, qui travaillait et vivait à Kiev et n'avait aucun rôle apparent à l'orphelinat, aux incidents. Rien n'indique qu'il ait voulu partir avec les membres de la famille qui avaient tenté d'entrer au Canada avant sa mort. Il ressort clairement des commentaires de la Commission qu'elle était préoccupée du fait que des documents relatifs à l'enquête ne figuraient pas au dossier.
[35]
La preuve documentaire constituait un fondement suffisant pour permettre à la Commission de conclure qu'une enquête avait été menée sans aide apparente de la famille et que les plaignants n'avaient jamais tenté de s'informer au sujet des résultats de l'enquête.
[36]
L'argument selon lequel la Commission a conclu à tort à l'existence de doutes sérieux concernant la cause du décès du fils, qu'elle croyait être un accident de la route, possède néanmoins un certain fondement. Il est difficile de ne pas souscrire à l'argument selon lequel l'état dans lequel se trouvait le fils, d'après les photos, n'est pas indicatif d'un accident de la route. Sans explication de la raison pour laquelle le fils avait le pantalon aux chevilles, notamment, le dénudement ne permet pas aisément un rattachement à la catégorie des accidents de la route.
[37]
Plus préoccupant encore est le fait que la Commission a effectué de sa propre initiative une recherche en droit ukrainien et examiné la disposition législative qui avait orienté l'enquête de la police, pour conclure qu'elle se rapportait à la négligence criminelle et non au meurtre ou à l'homicide involontaire. Non seulement la Commission a-t-elle effectué ses propres recherches en droit étranger, mais elle a également omis de donner aux parties la possibilité de répondre aux conclusions qu'elle en avait tirées.
[38]
Du fait que la disposition législative mentionnée dans la lettre concernant l'enquête se rapportait à la négligence criminelle au volant, la Commission a formé l'opinion que le fils du demandeur d'asile avait trouvé la mort dans un accident de la route. Il n'existe aucun autre élément de preuve étayant cette conclusion.
[39]
De toute évidence, en effectuant sa propre recherche et en s'appuyant sur les résultats de celle-ci pour tirer une conclusion qu'aucune des parties n'avait présentée relativement à une question en cause, la Commission a contrevenu aux règles fondamentales d'équité procédurale, ce qui devrait normalement entraîner le renvoi de l'affaire pour nouvel examen.
[40]
Bien que les demandeurs n'aient pas abordé dans leur mémoire la question de la recherche entreprise de son propre chef par la Commission, le Ministre admet qu'il aurait consenti au renvoi pour nouvel examen, mais il fait valoir que l'opinion de la Commission qu'un accident de la route était la cause du décès ne concourait pas à sa conclusion que la protection de l'État était suffisante. Autrement dit, le Ministre a soutenu que la suppression de cette opinion serait sans effet sur le caractère raisonnable de la décision, qui découlait de l'ensemble de la preuve établissant que l'État s'occupait de la question d'une manière satisfaisant aux exigences du droit canadien en matière de protection de l'État.
[41]
Si ce n'était des circonstances particulières en cause, je rejetterais sommairement cet argument. Le problème réside dans le fait que la Commission ignorait la nature ou la teneur de la plainte de M. Kuzmenko et les résultats de l'enquête, laquelle se déroulait, ou s'était déroulée, ainsi que nous l'avons su après coup, en fonction de la thèse de l'accident de la route. Mais, cela mis à part, tout ce dont elle disposait était des photos nécessitant des explications, compte tenu de la qualification du crime, et du témoignage des plaignants selon lequel l'enquête initiale laissait à désirer, notamment à cause de l'inhumation du corps.
[42]
La preuve permettant de conclure qu'il y a eu une enquête portant sur l'enquête initiale et que l'absence des résultats de l'enquête postérieure devant la Commission est attribuable aux plaignants est plus que suffisante. Les résultats de l'enquête sur la cause de la mort, le fondement de la conclusion qui en a découlé ou les suites qui y ont été données sont absents de la preuve. Les plaignants ne pouvaient simplement rester les bras croisés sans rien faire pour démontrer que l'enquête qu'ils avaient demandée n'avait pas été effectuée ou, qu'en raison d'autres éléments de preuve, ses résultats concernant la cause du décès de Danil ne pouvaient se défendre.
[43]
Je conviens que la preuve soumise à la Commission, exception faite de toute mention de la cause du décès de Daniil, paraît suffisante pour satisfaire aux exigences en matière de protection de l'État, telles qu'elles ont été formulées par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), au paragraphe 5:
[5] Depuis quinze ans, la Cour fédérale formule et développe le droit canadien relatif à la protection de l'État, en interprétant et en appliquant l'arrêt de principe à cet égard,
Canada (Procureur général) c. Ward,
1993 CanLII 105 (CSC
)
, [1993] 2 R.C.S. 689. Le juge La Forest y a souligné la nature supplétive de la protection des réfugiés; la responsabilité du Canada ne sera engagée que si l'État étranger n'assure pas de protection. En l'absence d'un effondrement complet de l'appareil étatique, il y a lieu de présumer que celui-ci est en mesure d'assurer cette protection. Le principe de la substitution a soulevé divers problèmes relativement à l'intensité de la présomption de la protection de l'État et au type de preuve susceptible d'en démontrer l'absence. Les principes suivants ont été formulés à cet égard:
(i) plus les institutions de l'État en cause seront démocratiques, plus lourde sera pour le demandeur la charge de réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2005 CF 193.
(iii) La preuve suffisante pour réfuter la présomption doit être « claire et convaincante »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2007 CAF 171.
(iv) La protection supplétive du Canada ne se trouvera pas engagée parce qu'il n'existe pas de protection parfaite ou idéale dans l'État en cause; c'est la « suffisance » qui importe, non pas l'efficacité intrinsèque:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2008 CAF 94.
[44]
En conséquence, je retiens l'argument du Ministre selon lequel le manquement à l'équité procédurale découlant du fait que la Commission a outrepassé les limites de l'audience, en tenant pour acquis qu'aucune conclusion n'a été tirée sur la cause probable du décès, ne fait pas disparaître la preuve sur laquelle la Commission s'est appuyée pour conclure à la suffisance de la protection de l'État.
2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que les demandeurs n'étaient pas des réfugiés sans prendre en compte les autres éléments de preuve relatifs aux menaces, aux agressions et à l'incendie criminel?
[45]
Les demandeurs soulignent que la Commission n'ayant formulé aucune conclusion défavorable en matière de crédibilité, elle n'a pas mis en doute les affirmations relatives aux menaces, aux agressions et à l'incendie criminel. Ils soutiennent que leur crainte subjective était fondée au vu de ces incidents, et que la preuve objective s'y rapportant était suffisamment crédible et grave pour que la qualité de réfugié leur soit reconnue. Ils font valoir que l'omission de la Commission de prendre en compte ces autres actes de persécution ainsi que la preuve contenue dans la documentation générale rendait la décision déraisonnable.
[46]
La Commission a convenu que ces incidents étaient survenus. La preuve établit toutefois qu'ils n'ont été signalés à la police qu'après l'enquête sur l'incendie criminel. À partir de ce moment, la question fondamentale devient celle de la suffisance de la protection de l'État. Ces incidents n'ont de pertinence qu'à l'égard de la question de savoir si la réponse de l'État a été adéquate et, pour les raisons susmentionnées, la Commission a conclu qu'elle l'avait été.
[47]
L'omission de la Commission d'examiner la documentation générale a également été invoquée. Considérant la preuve selon laquelle la police a entrepris une enquête, ces documents, toutefois, ne sont pas suffisants pour établir l'absence de protection de l'État.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . En outre, il n'a pas été allégué que la police était corrompue ni qu'elle était impliquée dans les menaces reçues par les demandeurs.
Conclusion
[48]
La décision de la Commission n'était pas déraisonnable. Elle fait partie des issues possibles acceptables qui se justifient au regard des faits et du droit. En conséquence, la demande est rejetée.
