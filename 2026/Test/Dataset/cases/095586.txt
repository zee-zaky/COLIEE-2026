Cullen, J.
: This is an application by the plaintiff for an order pursuant to rule 420 of the Federal Court Rules to amend and file an amended statement of claim in the within action. Prior to the hearing, counsel for the defendant consented to the amendments sought to paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the statement of claim. The only amendment in dispute was paragraph 9 which reads as follows:
"9. In the further alternative, the plaintiff pleads ss. 661 and 662 of the Canada Shipping Act, 1985, R.S. Chapter S-9 wherein the strict liability for the owner of the defendant is established for the discharge of a pollutant without the necessary proof of negligence."
[2]
This is an action in rem and the style of cause leaves no room for doubt on that issue. Certainly, personal liability can flow if the plaintiff secures judgment, e.g., if successful to the extent of one million dollars, and the judgment is able to secure only $500,000, then personal liability flows to the extent of $500,000. However, the Canada Shipping Act gives an additional benefit if seeking personal liability, namely the sections quoted in paragraph 9 above (or probably ss. 734 and 735 of the 1970 revision) but the section is only available in an in personam action. That strict liability cannot attach to the ship in this action, an in rem proceeding brought on the basis of nuisance and negligence.
[3]
It is also not open to the plaintiff under rule 420 to add a defendant by way of joinder. Counsel for the plaintiff sought this relief in argument but had not filed any motion to that effect. Whether it is open to the plaintiff to move a further motion to add a party or parties by way of joinder or to bring another action is something that may be considered appropriate by the plaintiff and determined before another judge. The plaintiff is not prejudiced if it seeks these alternatives.
[4]
Certainly, there is a difference between an action in rem and an action in personam. D.R. Thomas, Maritime Liens, vol. 14 (1980) 39:
"
The action in rem, being a proceeding against a res whereunder the res may be appropriated to the satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim, is patently distinct from an action in personam
. The latter is a proceeding inter partes founded on personal service and, if successful, leading to a judgment against the person of the defendant. Under the action in rem no direct demand is made against the owner of the res personally and the action in rem 'is an action in which the owners may take part, if they think proper, in defence of their property, but whether or not they will do so is a matter for them to decide, and if they do not decide to make themselves parties to the suit in order to defend their property, no personal liability can be established against them in that action'. [The 'Burns', [1907] per Fletcher Moulton, L.J., 137 (C.A.) at p. 149]
'The material difference which exists is capable of manifesting itself in various ways. Thus, on an issue of statutory construction, legislative restrictions placed upon the liability of a person are not necessarily construed as being of equal application to a proceeding against the property of that person.' [The "Longford" (1889), 14 P.D. 34 (C.A.), and The "Burns" (supra)]
"The distinction between an action in rem and an action in personam is therefore a matter of substance and not of mere form." [The City of Mecca (1881), 6 P.D. 106, per Lush, J., at p. 116]
[5]
Here today, the legislation makes an owner responsible for spills of the ship without proof of negligence. That legislation does not apply to action against the ship, and absolute liability without fault must be strictly construed.
[6]
And finally, The "Broadmayne" (1916), 13 Mar. L.C.N.S. 356 (C.A.). In the above-mentioned case, this ship was requisitioned one day before war was declared in 1914. After this there was an incident and proceedings
against the ship
. The actual owners appeared. There was a stay because of the requisition but the plaintiff had the owner of the ship in court. At page 361, Bankes, L.J., stated:
"Two questions arise for decision in this appeal: first, the effect upon an action in rem in the Admiralty Division of the appearance in the action of the owner of the res, and the giving by him of bail or an equivalent undertaking; and, secondly, the position with regard to liability to arrest of a requisitioned vessel against which an action in rem has been brought. In my opinion an action which has been commenced as an action in rem continues until its termination as an action in rem unless it undergoes some alteration in its character by amendment by order of the court or under the rules of court. It is, in my opinion, a mistake to say that the action changes its character and ceases to be an action in rem and becomes an action in personam when the owner of the res appears and gives bail. It is no doubt true that when this is done the action, so far as its special characteristic as an action in rem is concerned, has served its purposes, or possibly its chief purpose, when the owner of the res has been induced by reason of the arrest, or fear of arrest, of the vessel to enter an appearance and to give bail in order to obtain the release, or avoid the seizure, of his vessel. It is also true that when once the owner of the res has appeared the plaintiff has the advantage of being able in case of necessity to take his property in satisfaction of the judgment in addition to the bail. These consequences, however, are, in my opinion, incidents which arise only in the course of the action in rem, which add to its value, but which in no way alter or deprive it of its
special character
.
"The position is, I think, quite clearly indicated in the passage from Clerk's Praxis Curiae Admiralitatie, cited with approval by Jeune, J., in
The Dictator
(sup.) where the writer says that after appearance the case proceeds
ut in actione instituta contra personam debitoris
- that is to say, that action is to proceed as if, but only as if, it was an action in personam. The advantage of the action being an action in rem still remains, in the sense that, should the exceptional occasion arise, the court in a proper case would no doubt still have jurisdiction to order the arrest of the vessel." (Emphasis added)
[7]
For the reasons stated, the plaintiff's application to amend or add paragraph 9 of its statement of claim is dismissed.
Costs:
[8]
Both counsel presented argument on the subject of costs, and both gave cogent reasons why the other should be liable for costs in any event of the cause. The defendant was a little slow off the mark in consenting to some seven amendments and other deletions, but certainly the plaintiff had time to withdraw the motion and deal with paragraph 9 on the regular motion day in September. The plaintiff had some three and a half months to amend without leave, and the amendment sought to paragraph 9 did not arise from discovery. On balance it seems to me that costs should be in the cause.
Application dismissed.
